B003EV6DBM|3.0|Tom Baker was \\"my Doctor\\" growing up, I \\"tolerated\\" Peter Davison when he took over, and then when Colin Baker became The Doctor I completely lost interest and stayed away from anything Doctor Who.<br /><br />Then in 2010, I was told that BBC had brought back Doctor Who and that Christopher Eccleston was \\"fantastic.' Though I resisted at first, my girlfriend convinced me to checked them out (she had the first 4 seasons on DVD.) My faith in quality Doctor Who stories (and a quality Doctor) was renewed.<br />When Christopher left I was anticipating a crappy replacement but David Tennant blew me away with his performance! In fact, David Tennant rivaled my feelings about Tom Baker as being \\"my Doctor.\\" So when I heard that David Tennant would be leaving the role after \\"End of Time\\" I was again worried that a crappy replacement would follow.<br /><br />I watch the first episode of this current season, and through most of it I was not all that impressed by Matt Smith. He seemed too goofy, like he was trying to hard.<br /><br />****SPOILER ALERT****<br /><br />Then came the scene atop the Hospital, where The Doctor faces down the Atraxi. He asks, \\"Is this planet protected?\\" and the sequence that follows, leading up to Matt Smith stepping through the projected images of past Doctors and saying, \\"Hello, I'm The Doctor.\\" and then with unblinking eyes he says, \\"Basically...run!\\"<br /><br />****END OF SPOILER****<br /><br />That scene won me over and I felt that he might make a good Doctor after all.<br /><br />My review of the CHARACTERS:<br /><br />The Doctor:<br />In the past, he always managed to stay calm and even arrogant enough to believe that even though he had no clue how he would resolve the latest crisis, a solution would come to him. The Doctor multi-tasks, so sometimes he seems lost in his own world...however Matt Smith seems to come off more like the Doctor has ADHD. While most of the time I enjoyed Matt's performance, it had lots of moments when I just did not feel that engaged. Overall, I like his performance, I just hope he's able to make me LOVE his performance in the sixth season.<br /><br />Amy:<br />This companion took me a couple of episodes to accept, as she had spotty moments where her attempt at humor felt forced and her behavior/emotions seemed switch without a logical transition. While she is NO Rose Tyler (then again, no one in my opinion was a better companion than she) or Martha, I liked her far better than Donna.<br /><br />Rory:<br />Amy's boyfriend was at first annoying to me, he seemed too wimpy, then I grew to really like him with each episode.<br /><br />My review of the WRITING:<br /><br />Since Moffet was the writer of \\"Blink\\" which was one of my top favorite Tennant episodes, I expected the series to be on par. sadly, it was some of the weakest writing since the series relaunched. Granted, Actress Carey Mulligan was a large part of why \\"Blink\\" was so good in my opinion; the writing/story was actually smart and creative. NONE of the episodes in this season were equal in enjoyment for me.<br />For one thing, the Dalex episode had a weak \\"logic\\" as to why they were in WWII (I won't spoil it by saying why they're there). I did like the new Daleks though, they add a new level to the intimidating factor!<br />The episode marking the return of the Weeping Angels felt like Moffet wrote the episode as they shot scenes; very disjointed and not captivating at all!<br />The finale episode storyline was probably the biggest letdown. It was built up all through the season then fell flat and had me scratching my head and wondering if they had just made this up right before filming or did they really have this worked out all along?<br /><br />I was left feeling as if Moffet let his ego get the better of him, as if he thought he could only write gold. I say this because unlike the past four seasons, none of these episodes make me eager to watch them a second time unless I need reminding of something later. Simply put, I can name scenes that are my favorite but not one single episode that I would consider a favorite.<br />My main gripe about the episodes is that they focused less on the science and more on trying to seem cool and hip.<br /><br />My review of The Product:<br /><br />The packaging is well done. Mine has a lenticular face, which was cool.<br />The interior, like the previous four seasons, has a nice \\"busy but organized\\" look.<br />You get three illustrated cards and the artwork is impressive.<br />I love that they kept with the format of having various characters from the show colorfully displayed on each disk.<br />As for the bonus features, I loved Matt Smith better in his \\"Video Diary\\" sections than him as The Doctor, so I have faith his performance can improve.<br />The extras as a whole were very fulfilling. My only gripe is all the interview sections with Moffet, he comes off as very full of himself and I got tired of him pretty fast.<br /><br />While I can not say that this is a MUST HAVE for all Doctor Who fans, it is worth checking out. I liked it well enough to look forward to watching the new season.<br /><br />If you don't really care about bonus features or collectible cards and just want to watch the show, my suggestion is to take advantage of Amazon's Video On Demand to watch them.isodes is that they focused less on the science and more on trying to seem cool and hip.

B003TXKSWK|4.0|I saw them perform on Austin City Limits and ordered the CD that night. It arrived in new/wrapped condition and very quickly.

1840220554|5.0|I have read these books and they are all good. I would recommend these to any one who would like to read her collection.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I needed a good little pocket sharpener to carry with me. I saw this and liked the dual sharpening sections of carbon and ceramic to fine tune your edges and the diamond serrated edge sharpener. It doesn't get them shaving sharp but gets a quick smooth edge that will handle most any other chore, even flaying. WELL WORTH IT!
B0031R5K68|3.0|The amount of documentation gathered by the author is impressive. The book is a combination of Washington D.C city guide and a deep plunge into Masonic traditions, with a zest of American history, but the scenario drags on to much, and I am a bit tired of the terrorist thing. It could have been much better, and...shorter.
0439023513|5.0|...REAL!!<br /><br />I read Mockingjay this afternoon in one knock-down, drag-out, exhausting, emotionally draining sitting and I was eager to write my review - so, I have to say I am once again amazed by the poor (and VERY long winded) reviews. I intend to be brief but allow me to touch on just a few things...<br /><br />The first is that Suzanne Collins did a beautiful job of wrapping things up (for better or worse) leaving no loose ends to ponder, and though I have read a few reviews claiming it was poorly written, I can not disagree more.<br /><br />Second, it has been said that Katniss did not evolve as a character. I wonder if the writers of these reviews did not \\"skim\\" the book instead of reading it? Perhaps this might explain how one could miss Katniss' own reflections of how she had changed... Her realizations about herself??<br /><br />Finally, (and to me the most important thing of all) there have been a multitude of complaints about the ending. Again I am perplexed. The story followed its natural order. Readers don't have to like an ending for it to be the RIGHT ending. A good story follows the series of cause and effect. Let's face it, we picked up a book about children fighting to the death! Any one expecting this tale to end with a warm and fuzzy \\"happily ever after\\" ending was deluding themselves. Had we not experienced Katniss' loss, her pain, her betrayal, we would have been robbed.<br /><br />A good story should make you laugh out loud, cry, celebrate... for me it has to be real. Collins seemed to do all of these things effortlessly.
B002TKFEZK|4.0|Not an easy book, but will give you a better view of the economic world we are living in. Do not expect to be less scared after reading it, as economic follies have a long past and, probably, a brilliant future!
B003J27WFW|5.0|One wouldn't think one of the most successful bands in rock history came from Canada. But Beyond the Lighted Stage tells the story of the rock trio Rush. Using old footage along with interviews from members of the band, you see how they evolved from a Led Zeppelin-like metal act into a sophisticated group with a beloved following. They're the world's biggest cult band and for good reason. You'll learn why in this documentary.
0307474275|5.0|First off, as you can tell, if you hate this book then you hate this book. There are always lovers and haters among every community and you just have to deal with it.<br /><br />Now, onto the matter at hand. I love this book. I read it a little after it came out while some people in my high school Art class were discussing it. I couldn't put it down once I started. It's a work of FICTION...sorry about the caps, just some people don't know what that means in their reviews. It's about the search for the blood line of Jesus Christ by Robert Langdon, Professor of Religious Symbology at Harvard University. He travels throughout Paris to find clues and makes enemies a long the way.<br /><br />The ending might be easy to predict if you read the book closely but it's a shocker if you don't. Dan Brown is a great writer of Historical Fiction and does research to make sure his descriptions are correct. I'd recommend this to anyone who is into suspense, much like his other books.<br /><br />If you've seen the movie based off of this book, be sure to pick this up as there are major points missing from the movie.
B003U6HQGW|1.0|I like my non fiction to be true...or even mostly true since I am inclined to allow a certain flexibility due to lack of memory or need to fill in holes. As I read this story I found myself questioning more and more the veracity of it. Up to 12 days trekking in the DESERT without water? Seriously? Not getting the first name of one of his survival mates even though the whole escape took over year? Really? Worrying about setting a fire, find a flat stone in the desert for grilling and cooking a snake after weeks without food? (hell, if it was me I would already be considering cannibalism, an uncooked snake would be a treat!)And of course let's not forget about the yeti? After I read the book I searched the internet and saw that I was not the only one questioning whether this story was true or not. As I said I like my true stories to be TRUTHFUL  to the events, hence the one star rating.
B0001KZM3O|4.0|Yes, it is more like a Roger Waters solo effort than a Floyd collaboration, but I think there are some fine tunes here.  Most notably, Paranoid Eyes and The Tigers Broke Free, which was wisely taken from the movie The Wall.  This cd plays like a companion piece to the film, and I would encourage all Floyd fans to dust off their old lps or buy the cd anew and give it a fresh listen.  I am not a fan of Waters' actual solo work, but I quite like The Final Cut.
B002WN35DC|5.0|If you have kids and want them to learn Spanish , this book is easy, lovely and a with a lot of beautiful inspirational thoughts. perfect for 7 and up.(I'm reading it again and I'm 37).
0307346617|4.0|After having pulled myself through a couple less-than-entertaining reads, I was on the hunt for a book I would actually love and not want to throw in the toilet afterwards. I definitely found it here. Now I'm just asking myself why I didn't think about reading a zombie book before - because zombies are sweet!    As you have probably already figured out, World War Z is more a collection of fictitious mini-stories than a single novel. The war against zombies is over, well for the most part, and the author has taken on the job of interviewing a plethora of people that survived to tell the tale. If you had ever read \\"In the Hot Zone\\", the format is eerily similar.    An awesome read that only gets better as you go along. My only grip was that at times I found the book to focus less on the zombies (which there can never be enough of) and more on political and military jargon. Each interviewee, other than a very small handful, speak in much the same tone and format, which again I found a bit disappointing. Nevertheless, a great and entertaining read! 4 stars!
6300216802|5.0|This first film gave the original Trek cast a chance to flex their acting muscles and flesh out their characters. It has some wonderful performances and some awesome special effects. It's an auspicious start to the Trek film legacy!
B002GHHHG0|4.0|Wonderful tales that will make you squirm and totally creep you out, good sense of fun throughout as well makes this a winner.  The blu-ray quality is ok for this early 80's film but don't expect miracles in the sound department, just dolby surround on offer here.  I love the feel this movie has, pure horror comic book from start to finish.
B000002GF8|5.0|I am not sure if Synchronicity represents the Police's best work, but I will say that the last 6 songs on this album are some of their best: \\"Synchronicity II\\"; \\"Every Breath You Take\\"; \\"King of Pain\\"; \\"Wrapped Around Your Finger\\"; \\"Tea in the Sahara\\"; and \\"Murder By Numbers\\".      Sting's lyrics on \\"Synchronicity II\\", \\"King of Pain\\", and \\"Wrapped Around Your Finger\\" are outstanding.  I especially like the imagery of the lyrics on \\"King of Pain\\".    The first 5 songs on the album, however, are not up to the level they achieved on the Final 6.  Of the first 5 songs, \\"Synchronicity I\\" and \\"O My God\\" are a bit better than average, but the other 3 are forgettable filler.    This recording is a tale of two halves.  The first half has a couple OK moments, but the second half makes the whole thing worthwhile.  Definitely recommended.

B001GWK2MC|5.0|First of all I was scared to buy this because of some of the negative reviews.  Let me be clear if you are looking for a commercial grade inflatable jumpy, then this is not it.  But I would say the quality of construction is much better than most inflatables I have seen.  We bought this for my 1 year old son ( 32 lbs ).  He doesn't jump in it yet, but he does like to sit in it and play with the 100 plastic balls we bought for it.  It has been sitting in our living room for 2 weeks now with no signs of leaks or problems.  So far we feel its been worth every penny.  Its a lot bigger than it looks in the picture.  Its also easy to throw a large blanket over it and turn it into an fort.
B000002UVX|3.0|I listened to this recording hundreds of times as a teenager in the middle to late 1970s, but almost never since then. Having recently listened to it several times, my judgments have both changed and stayed the same. I think less of it than I did then (after all, I'm a jazz snob now); but some things remain laudable.<br /><br />Hendrix left \\"the experience\\" behind and tried a new band, with very mixed results. Billy Cox (on old military buddy) on bass does a credible job; Buddy Miles on drums is another story. His ride cymbals technique is terrible. He either hits eighth of sixteen notes on the high hat or used the crash cymbals as ride cymbals. There is no finesse in his playing. This can have a dramatic effect if done sparingly. When overdone it is become overkill. Miles rhythms lack creativity, specially compared to Mitch Mitchell. The beat Miles lays down is usually plodding and often boring. Worse yet, his singing (and scatting) is annoying. However, one can understand the words that Miles sings; this cannot be said of many of Jimi's acoustic blasts.<br /><br />The arrangements, spare \\"Machine Gun,\\" are very loose and the vocals seem improvised and meaningless. I read that Hendrix, listening to the recording, was bothered by Miles's endless scatting. Perhaps Buddy was trying to keep up with Hendrix or compensate for his lack of skill on the skins. In any event, the result is less than stellar.<br /><br />What saves this recording is, of course, Hendrix's guitar work on every piece and especially on the searing, soaring piece, \\"Machine Gun,\\" which was a protest song against the war in Viet Nam. Hendrix politics may have been wrong (consider the result of the US losing that war--the killing fields), but the sentiment was expressed in a painfully beautiful dirge. The guitar tone is unearthly and mesmerizing, as is the playing itself. For me, that holds up after thirty-five years. There really isn't another piece of music in the Hendrix songbook that approaches its intensity; and on this piece Buddy Miles playing seems to fit, despite his musical limitations.<br /><br />Jimi and Buddy were signing about and longing for freedom and love and peace. Sadly, they did not have a worldview sufficient to orient them rightly and wisely to these realities. As such, the lyrics present a kind of pathetic romanticism mixed with psychedelic silliness.intensity; and on this piece Buddy Miles playing seems to fit, despite his musical limitations.<br /><br />Jimi and Buddy were signing about and longing for freedom and love and peace.

B000BFH2S2|1.0|Very disappointed that there was no explanation for what Region 2 is. So where is it??  This is my first bad experience with Amazon and a CD/DVD product.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This is a classic well made movie with a story-line that is especially appropriate in current times. We are at a point where \\"We The People\\" must decide whether we want to live in Bedford Falls or Pottersville. The movie shows how each of us can make a huge difference in society if we maintain our integrity and good values and never \\"sell out\\".
B001DZ9GRE|5.0|Disk one of this collection was great.  Unfortunately disk 2 was not playable.  It had a disk error every time I tried to play it.  Amazon was great at taking it back.  I did not order another in case it happened again.

B001NLKWLW|2.0|Kate Morton is a good writer.  She certainly has the ability, and I was happy that she knows her grammar.  This book is full of mysteries and secrets and all are revealed by the book's end.  However, this is MUCH longer than it needs to be.  If you decide to read it, I strongly recommend keeping a list of characters since the book hops from one time period to another and still another and back again many times.    I read this in four days, which is probably for the best since many references are made to earlier scenes in the book.  If four or five hundred pages have gone by, it might be difficult to remember if you take a couple of weeks to get through this volume.  I was hoping to find a book to discuss at my book club.  It won't be this one.
0061726826|4.0|I had very high hopes for Delirium, having read on a number of blogs that it was pretty much the most fantasmagorical book of the year. These kinds of expectations often wreak havoc on my reading experience, because the book just cannot live up to the hype. Delirium largely did.<br /><br />The concept of this dystopia is endlessly fascinating, unlike any of the dystopias I have read before. Certainly, there are others where love is denied and not welcomed by the society (Brave New World, for example), but I have not read one where love was the main issue. The society's documents, which open every section (as is done in Unwind), were very interesting, especially the slightly altered Bible quotes. Very clever.<br /><br />Dear reader, you may have already gathered that I really do not like Romeo and Juliet, but here it is again, weaved throughout the story. The initial reference was pretty hilarious though; in this world, they did actually allow the play to be read (unlike Shakespeare's love poems), because it was a perfect example of the dangers of love. Even the young saw it not as romantic, but as a horror story. Ha!<br /><br />The beginning of this novel actually reminded me, oddly enough, of Footloose. The kids, who have not been treated for the love disease, are not allowed to have any fun. They have early curfews, boys and girls aren't allowed to mingle, and loud music and dancing are forbidden. As expected, many kids will find a way to do forbidden things, nor appreciating their parents stifling them. Of course, the comparison ends somewhere: Regulators armed with guns are not quite the same as John Lithgow armed with a Bible.<br /><br />The only downside to Delirium was that much of the plot was pretty predictable. Still, I enjoyed the writing, the concept and the characters. I eagerly await book two! Highly recommended!
B0036OS3Q0|4.0|I just received these boots a day ago and I've worn them twice already. Especially being from northen jersey there is a lot of snow on the ground aswell as ice it is hard to walk in normal walking shoes. I slipped many times before I realized I needed to invest in some snow boots. These boots are fairly light and very comfortable. The design is alright but I take comfort over aesthetic for the current conditions. So far they have been good to me but make sure to order a half size up as people suggested.

B000IMUYJM|5.0|It's Christmas time, and the sorority sisters of an unnamed college (re: filmed in Canada) are partying before they return home for the holidays.  Meanwhile, an unseen lunatic/psycho/madman enters the house to do bad things.  As the police investigate a missing girl in town, they learn about the obscene phone calls being made to the sorority house and try tracing them...<br /><br />Black Christmas is sometimes credited as \\"the first slasher movie\\", but let's put it up there with Bava's earlier Twitch of the Death Nerve, say they both \\"created\\" or popularized the genre, and call it a day.  These days, having been through literally decades of \\"slasher\\" movies, and then Saw, and all manner of onscreen nastiness, Black Christmas a) should be viewed in context and appreciated for its time and ::gasp:: originality, and b) is still creepy and demented enough for today's fans to enjoy.<br /><br />The film also created or least popularized some of the most dependable elements (now clich&eacute;s) of horror movies:<br /><br /> - \\"College\\" students played by people well out of college (including Keir Dullea / Bizarro Joe Montana)<br /> - Unspeakable horror during a holiday<br /> - The killer's point of view shot / heavy breathing<br /> - The obscene, creepy phone calls<br /> - The phone calls coming from within the house(!)<br /> - The killer sometimes \\"hiding\\" in plain sight (because the cast is blind)<br /> - The cops as complete idiots<br /><br />Using the \\"less is more\\" approach, Black Christmas eschews gore for suspense and just general creepiness.  There's some blood, but nothing like its successors.  Director Bob Clark has a nice touch when, during a scene where a town search party looks for a lost girl, they come upon what we can only assume is her dead body...but it's never shown, and we hear only the barking of the hounds.  The restraint is old-fashioned compared to today.  Clark fought to keep the gore minimal and the ending ambiguous when---surprise!---the studio wanted more explicit material.  John Carpenter cites it as a big influence on Halloween (often credited for being the first slasher), and rumor has it that Halloween actually came out of early ideas for a Black Christmas sequel.  (Halloween is great on its own, and there never was a Black Christmas sequel.)<br /><br />The film holds up well, though some weaned on not-scary gore zone freak shows may not get as excited.  Horror fans will appreciate a horror movie that lets the audience's (depraved) imagination fill in the blanks.  Remade in 2006, when---surprise!---the gore was far more explicit, and they went through the trouble of thoroughly explaining the killer and his motivations.<br /><br />The film looks great on DVD, and I'm sure it's even sharper on BluRay, though there must be limitations to how sharp it can appear given the source material and age.  Fans will love the photography, how the cheerily decorated sorority house takes on a creepy feeling, how the Christmas lights start to look...eerie.  The extras include making-of and behind-the-scenes material, very welcome for this cult flick.  Oddly, no trailers?<br /><br />Highly recommended on DVD or BluRay, it's still seems like an underrated classic, and definitely a keeper.  Not recommended to those who have a problem with horror movies set during Christmas.g influence on Halloween (often credited for being the first slasher), and rumor has it that Halloween actually came out of early ideas for a Black Christmas sequel.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|I might as well come right out with it:  Any attempts to discount Pixar's absolute mastery of the craft of computer animated features are absolutely futile from this critic from this moment forward.  Until now I've been pretty consistent in giving their ballyhooed works 4-star ratings due to the sheer cleverness of their plots and the attention to detail of their visual prowess (sometimes even tainted in protest by Disney's habit of over-promoting) but 2007's Ratatouille has managed to so thoroughly touch upon every single element of what makes a classic film that it nearly single-handedly atones for every set of Toy Story bed sheets or Finding Nemo lunchboxes bartered the world over.<br /><br />Well I suppose as is customary, I should begin this review with a short synopsis of the story with one caveat: Ratatouille really doesn't lend itself to summation.  I knew this going in when all of the pre-purchase research I did led to the same shaky conclusion: Really, a tale about a cooking rat in France?  Never mind all that! This is to French rat chefs what Wall-E is to your trash compactor or what Monsters Inc is to applying for a job at the electric company.  In other words, Pixar takes a fairly mundane concept and packs it so chock full of charm and personality that we would be captivated just looking at an animated lamp.  Oh wait, they've proven that already but I digress.<br /><br />Ratatouille centers on the tale of Remy, a gray rat gifted with a sense of smell. With aspirations of using his talents to concoct gourmet dishes, he is instead given the most un-romantic task of sniffing out rat poison for his rodent colony.<br /><br />When his family is forced to abandon their home in the walls of a cottage in the French countryside, Remy is separated from his brood and ends up in the sewers of Paris. In hunger and desperation, Remy has a hallucination of his lifelong idol, the recently deceased chef Auguste Gusteau. Following Gusteau's advice, Remy finds himself at the skylight overlooking the kitchen of Gusteau's world famous restaurant.  By fate, destiny or just good fortune, the wheels are in motion to put Remy in a position to showcase his repressed talents.<br /><br />Well if after having read all this, the plot sounds awesome to you, congratulations.  You are already ahead of where I was going in.  I really couldn't imagine a full-length animated feature film (and one at 111-minutes at that) about said topic being terribly intriguing and yet I was pleasantly surprised almost immediately.<br /><br />Like most Pixar pieces the exact source of the charm isn't even easily identified.  There is abundant attention to visual and textural detail on a near frame per frame basis, the voice acting is spot on and the character animations are, well, pure Pixar and yet even still I can't help but profess a certain degree of subtle wit and faultless timing that never allows the viewer to forget this is a high class Disney venture through and through.<br /><br />Pacing is downright spectacular with just enough character building and story-setting to establish the tone of what's to come.  The action wastes little time revealing itself and is remarkably satisfying throughout the multiple incarnations contained within.<br /><br />The scoring is Michael Giacchino, which, suffice to say, is downright spectacular with beautiful soaring compositions and personal mood-setters scattered throughout.<br /><br />In all it's difficult to adequately isolate just what it is that makes Ratatouille so wondrous.  I like to think that, like all of Brad Bird's works, there isn't a single factor that outshines the others so much as it's the culmination of years of lessons learned both in 2D and 3D animation mediums.<br /><br />The script contains the type of polish and fineness that comes only with years of tweaking and rewriting.  Scenes flow with deliberate prose, sequences form with near-poetic resolve, and the grand story arc is seamless in its delivery.<br /><br />About the only thing I can say that even resembles a complaint about this work is the simple reality that of all the Pixar pieces, a strong argument could be made that this one is the most adult-oriented of the lot.  Not that kids won't marvel at the bright colors, cute characters, and general onscreen action, it seems much of the subtleties, humor, pacing and gourmet food integration will certainly be better appreciated by the older set.<br /><br />In all I'm quite proud to finally slap a perfect 5-star rating on a Disney/ Pixar property.  This one finally delivers, for me anyway; the potential hinted upon in every Pixar film prior and since and does so with style, grace and humor.  Director Brad Bird concludes his interview on the disc by saying that he loves the medium of computer animation and that fact's apparent here from beginning to end.t this work is the simple reality that of all the Pixar pieces, a strong argument could be made that this one is the most adult-oriented of the lot.

B003EYVXXW|4.0|The movie uniquely depicts an era that has not been well documented, in a region of the world that has been forgotten. It takes place in the early Christian years of the 4th century in Alexandria, Egypt, governed by the Eastern Roman Empiror Theodosius. The tumultous years of early Christianity are well depicted as Christianity, Paganism and Judaism vie for predominance. Among that strife, Hypatia, a Greek scholar and caretaker of the library of Alexandria faces the fanaticism of Pagans, Jews and Early Christians, amidst her struggle to solve the mystery of the motion of planets. Being a woman, she is viciously discriminated by Early Christian dogma. Finally, both her life and the library fall victims to Christian fanatics. Many of the manuscripts are lost and her knowledge of planetary movement will have to wait until Kepler to be revisited. The movie has a sad ending, and it is not recommended for minors.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones has vocal qualities that are both versatile and soothing. Add her songwriting capabilities and she is a musical force to be reckoned with, making it easy to understand why so many music stalwarts enjoy performing with her.  Her style runs the gamut from torchlight to contemporary and, in my opinion, she doesn't miss a thing.   She makes 'easy listening' music actually easy to listen to.
B0019ZS0GG|5.0|My son was in the 3 Marines and in Iraq when I ordered this DVD. I spent 14 months in Vietnam but I wanted to see what my son was up against.  This is a very different war.  I watched the entire DVD with a lump in my throat as I saw the bravery of these young men and the price they paid to take Fallujah.  The embedded reporter did an excellent job and this DVD is about as real as it is going to get with out being there.  I cannot say that this will change anyone's mind about the war but I can promise that it will increase your understanding of the war and the men fighting it. I am so proud of my son. He did two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan, but I could not watch this DVD again until he was out of the Marines.  I wish every American could see this one.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This was a great movie. Moves quickly and is enjoyable. For a light, enjoyable movie, this is a great choice. If you are a Bruce Willis fan, it is definitely worth seeing.
B001QWBM62|5.0|We have been using the Zoom H4n for a few weeks now and so far so good.  It has been easy to use and very user friendly.  We use in a church setting and it has done all that it was reviewed to do.  Getting it connected into our sound board was simple and due to the easy of use it has been simple to train others on how to use the Zoom.
B004B32532|5.0|I had heard about this movie for years and always wanted to see it.  I kept waiting and waiting and waiting for it to come out on DVD and it never did...at least not here in the U.S.  So, I finally got fed up and bought a bootleg.  A lot of the time the anticipation and hype cannot come close to living up to the reality.  In this case, it did and then some.  I literally loved this movie from the get-go.  From the look, feel, characters, structure, music, etc...It was truly an incredible viewing experience.  Unlike anything I have seen before.    Now that this Blu-Ray has come out I don't have to look at my washed out bootleg dvd anymore.  I knew it would look great and it did not disappoint.  The Tattoo Lady's tattoos really pop and you can make out every single one in fine detail.  Little things I didn't notice before are now so very apparent, like Concha's earrings...they are arms!    The extras are also A+!  I found them very informative and while some of it is repetitive from extra to extra you will find out a lot of new things about Santa Sangre.    Overall, top notch job by Severin with this Blu-Ray.  Great care and work were put into an excellent release of this movie!  I will state that this is not a movie for all tastes, but for those that \\"get\\" it this is a true cinematic experience.  5 stars and then some!!
0316044695|5.0|An awesome book!  Action packed and true told by the only Navy Seal to survive the mission. The story about how one of our American Soldiers was taken in and protected by a very special Afghan family who refused to let the Taliban hurt him.  Very moving. I've read dozens of books about this war in Afghanistan and this one stands out as the very best one of all. I've now even seen the movie, but the movie barely scratches the surface of the book. Read the book, THEN, see the movie.
B003EYVXUU|3.0|Right off the bat, I will say if you like this you should check out the original.  While they are very similar (obviously), I just feel the original put the story together so much better.  The relationship between the two central characters seemed much more natural and realistic in the original.  I think that the actress playing \\"Abby\\" in this version is trying to be creepy.  Also, the CGI when she attacks someone is really not very good.  The movements are disjointed and not fluid.  Being that the shots were usually from a distance, why not just get a gymnast to hop around and do the stunts?  For example, when she climbed the tree it looked awful.      One thing I did prefer in this version over the original is that the kid playing the main bully was actually better.  Also, Owen/Oscar in this version, while not \\"better\\" than the original was pretty good and convincing.    Abby vs. Eli is no contest as I mentioned earlier.  Eli in the original is MUCH better!  Also, the cinematography of the original and the snowy landscapes were fantastic.  This version has that slightly washed out \\"scary\\" look that actually takes you out of the movie more than putting you in the movie.    I'm not a huge fan of remakes, but I'm not a guy that decides I won't like something just because it is a remake.  I loved the remakes of Invasion of the Body Snatchers ('78), The Thing ('82), The Fly ('86), The Blob ('88) and more recently I really enjoyed Dawn of the Dead ('04).  In this case, the remake was just not able to reach the level of excellence that the original did.  Original 5 stars!  This remake 3 stars...it was good/okay, but not great!
1932100660|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  It's definitely not a diet fad, but based on many years of studies of diets of different cultures, particular in China.  I've passed the information on to friends - and one of my sons is beginning to incorporate some of the findings in his family's meals.  I feel much healthier physical and mentally when I stick to following the author's suggestions, altho I'm still rather loose about it.
B002ZG980U|3.0|I won't flat out call this movie stupid. I thought it was 100% watchable and pretty entertaining. These are the reasons why I certainly wouldn't call it a bad movie in any way except for the fact that I was pretty let down. When I heard about this movie, I expected to struggle with the concept and not know what was going on or what was going to happen. That didn't happen once. In fact, most of it was pretty predictable and the premise seemed forced to me. Like they said, \\"let's try reeeeeally hard to confuse an average audience.\\" There wasn't anything really taking place that made me go, \\"wait, wait, wait...what's going on? What happened?\\" In that aspect, considering it was being touted as a complete mind-bender, I was thoroughly disappointed and didn't feel completely fulfilled with the experience as a movie fan with viewing prowess.     That said, the acting was very good and the movie looked spectacular. It was well-shot, the dialogue was good enough for a movie like this, and the action was nice enough to get the blood flowing a bit. I still feel like Leo looks like a 20 year old kid wearing his dad's suit. They obviously have told him to grow his patchy excuse for facial hair out in his last 2 films (this and Shutter Island) to make himself look older, but I'm not feeling it. He performs well so I won't say he was miscast, but it's an observation I've made in the more recent parts of his career.    In the end, 3 mediocre stars. Not my favorite or what I would see as the best movie of the year. And no, it wasn't the hype that killed it. I heard as much, if not more, hype about Scott Pilgrim and I loved that movie. The concept really just didn't impress me in the end, considering the final product it produced. I would have been just as happy with a solid action movie that was well-shot and well-cast, because under the pseudo-intellectual attempt of a concept, that's all it was to me. *** for a good movie that left me feeling happy to see it, but disappointed thatI didn't love it.
B003EYVXSW|5.0|Dren was cute in a freaky way at the beginning because she looked like a raw chicken with legs, throwing all her food and goo around. The first scene with the cat got me a little worried because I thought she was going to eat it like she did that rabbit. But turned out she just wanted a pet to cuddle. The later scene with the cat got me a little sad because it got stung/poisoned to death. Then there was a SLAP to the FACE and I thought Elsa was going to be killed next. But Dren let up and stole the key to get outside. She got shovel'd upside the head by Elsa. A few moments later we she her on a table because Elsa decided it was best to remove Dren's stinger. Later doing a sex scene with Clive, Dren's stinger grows back, just as Elsa walks in on both of them. Super awkward moment there! To me it felt humorous the movie had sex scenes with some kind of human/animal hybrid. I did think at some point Dren would learn to actually speak in complete sentences but I guess not. The last bit of the movie involves Dren becoming a monster bat-like creature killing all your men and raping all your women. Because of this Elsa gets pregnant and plan to let this monster baby be born.    One scene I forgot was the demonstration of Fred and Ginger, two earlier creatures Clive and Elsa created. They went crazy and started killing each other, causing the display case to shatter, throwing glass and blood all over the people in the front row. Too bad for them, huh?
B002ZG98UK|5.0|One of best 3D movies have ever seen, extremely recommended. 3D effects are so amazing, in fact 3D technology was phenomenal.

B0036TGSIK|4.0|\\"...Yesterday I saw a brighter movie, a teen comedy I recommend  \\"Easy A\\". I love this genre. This movies is fashioned after \\"Ferris Bueller\\" and the John Hughes teen movies of the '80's \\"Breakfast Club\\" \\"Sixteen Candles\\"  and of course the greatest teen movie of them all, John Lucas's spectacular \\"American Graffiti\\" which launched his career and the careers of the following unknowns: Harrison Ford, Richard Dreyfuss, Suzanne Summers, Ron Howard, Cindy Williams, Mackenzie Phillips, Charles Martin Smith, Candy Clark, Paul Le Mat, etc, etc. (an AFI top 100 movie), but I digress.<br /><br />Easy A is about a smart high school teen Olive, played by the very cute, vivacious Emma Stone, who decides she would be more popular if she pretended she was no longer a virgin. So she invents a sexual partner. Suddenly she has a \\"reputation\\" as the school floozy. She is reading Hawthorn's \\"the Scarlet Letter\\" in English - probably the only one in her class of morons who is, and she improbably decides to cut out a bright red \\"A\\" and attach it to her top. She runs afoul of the Campus Christians with Opinions...The jokes and situations go on from there.  She decides to flaunt it to make a point, dresses the part, she has a seemingly vast collection of bustiers, corsets, with red A's and impossibly high platform wedgies (which I am reliably informed, by Lisa, are now called \\"wedge heels\\"). This movie is very funny, thoughtful and much better than the run of the mill teen flick today.<br /><br />It's not \\"Citizen Kane\\", it's not even the \\"King's Speech\\", but it is funny and entertaining....\\"
0061989142|5.0|I have always been a fan of Lauren Conrad through her time on Laguna Beach and The Hills.  Since I'm in Australia, I haven't been able to find the book here and stumbled across it online.    Lauren has a classic and timeless style which she details in the book with practical and realistic advice.    A must read for any fashionista and not just fans of her show.  Ten out of ten.
B004HAG40O|5.0|Stipe's Buck on geetar, folks.  A magnificent collaboration of songs eschewing R.E.M., the Police, Springsteen's the Stones' \\"Country Honk,\\" Gram Parker, built around a vogue changing sessions -... Read cormac mccarthy!
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I was going to pre-order.  But not now.  Why does Lucas continue to screw with us?  Just give us what we want and you'll sell tons.  I'm not interested in your re-hashed versions.  I want the ones I saw in the theater.
B002ZG980U|3.0|I am not a fan of Nolan's work except Dark Knight,I noticed The guy from Bronson (Tom Hardy) is in it, Leonardo DiCrapio as I call him is in it and even he pulls off the performance the Hindu looking dude from Drag me to Hell is in here,and Michael Caine(Brief sadly),It is a long tenuous and at times Intense movie. You have to pay close Attention as goes in over and over and Over through many different things all adding to a ClusterF..k. It is decent because well it is original but Originality alone can't save it,Maybe an Art Student can appreciate it.I Neither Liked it nor disliked it,I am just indifferent to it.
1932100660|5.0|Must read for all the people out there confused about nutrition and health.  Clearly written with ample references and scientific data.  The book cuts through the nutrition nonsense out there.  Addressed major health problems we are facing.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This book was the best of the 3 I think.  I loved every page, really hard to put down.  I will miss Lizbeth and Michael.
B003Y5HWJU|3.0|After all the acclaim, was really looking forward to this HBO series.  What I was left with was disappointment.  Typical of many of Scorcese's films, though he only directed the pilot, this show is a little too slow & drawn out.  You are left trying to stick with it hoping for some little detail to keep watching, and the show only just about delivers.  If you were a fan of The Sopranos, The Wire or 24, and were hoping for another series in that league, you are going to be disappointed and a little, em bored.
0143039881|4.0|The trial of prominent Nazi Eichmann is interspersed with his personal history (he was the quintessential \\"loser\\") and goes deeply into the historical background. This book raises moral and political questions such as: what happens when the evildoer is not a vengeful or crazed lunatic but simply a petty bureaucrat \\"following orders\\"? Eichmann doesn't seem to have any personal hatred toward Jews but he fit into a system geared for just that. Was his trial justly conducted? (he was kidnapped and brought to be tried in Jerusalem by an Israeli court.) Arendt is critical and at times mocking of the show trial, but one thing is clear to her: \\"he must hang.\\" The critics of her day often saw her as a self-hating Jew or Nazi sympathizer, which she's not. This book gives a lot, particularly in factual background, the common assumptions people had about what a war criminal should look and behave like, and the underlying difficulty in accepting evil that is committed, in the end, due to a lack in intelligence and imagination. These are real insights, and Arendt actually has an amazing ability to step outside and question incongruities within the accepted framework of the case. I'm torn between whether her polemical style sharpens her account (and makes her seem credible, since few are spared from irony) or makes the reader focus on the wrong thing. I don't know, because Arendt's sensitivity to ironies and paradoxes is the key to the whole book, and if at times playing the role of critic comes a trifle too easily (for example, towards the judges, non-German Jews, the new Israeli state) and to me it sometimes does, I think she gets a reprieve. Overall, a book worth reading.
B001IXXYBA|5.0|Not Casablanca, but an excellent movie, and it's hard to find much, other than the 1939-1960 Classics that's worth looking at these days.  Whoopee Goldberg is not on my A list of actors, but she did a great job in this one.
B000002KDS|5.0|I got this album when I was 16.  The more I knew it would drive my mother nuts, the more I wanted it.  I got the CD today from Amazon and for a moment, I was 16 again.....but with a clear head.  I still knew all the words and realized how much I still love this CD.  My mother has passed, but I still believe it would drive her nuts if she were still alive..........I'm thrilled that Alice was inducted into the Rock N' Roll Hall of Fame......it's about time!!
B001VNB54A|5.0|Excellent movie.Everyone should watch this so we don't take our freedom for granted.Thank you Steven Spielberg & Tom Hanks for making this mini-series.
B001BPQT8A|4.0|The film is an absolute masterpiece and has been in my top ten list since I first saw the the film in 1995.  Hard to believe it's already 15 years old, it doesn't feel dated at all.  In order, picture quality, sound mix, and packaging...<br /><br />As for the superb quality that everyone keeps raving about, well... true it is a BD transfer which is beautiful.  Since the camera original is a high speed film and bleach bypassed, there is a lot of film grain, and I feel the same grain is pretty prevalent in the DVD version of the film.  What I am trying to say is, though it IS a step up from DVD, the grainy quality is still there so viewers should not expect a \\"flawless\\" and crisp image.  Let me tell you though, the colors in this film you're not gonna get with digital.  The extras are good, although they're pretty much the same as the DVD extras.<br /><br />The sound mix has absolutely changed from the DVD version.  Though I am not sure I like it.  The surround sound seems to have improved greatly, but a lot of the levels seem off to me.  While I understand everyone's system may vary and may be calibrated differently... some of the loud and bassy sounds (such as the thunder right before the opening sequence) WAY overpowered the otherwise more silent dialogue and city ambiance that is featured in the opening sequence.  (the sound mix does improve bringing up some of those sounds in certain scenes, which is nice)<br /><br />Now the \\"book\\" part... Given that Dr. Strangelove is also packaged as a \\"Blu-Ray Book\\" I wasn't completely sold on the idea.  Seemed gimmicky to me, and a waste of paper.  I will say that though I still feel the Seven BDB is the same, it is really nicely printed.  The color paper used is of a high quality (almost a mylar texture) with different coatings so there is matte with gloss combined.  Maybe that's hard to picture.  In essence, the pages are really nice.  The content talks briefly about the picture, then theres a spread dedicated each to Pitt, Freeman, Platrow, and Fincher that simply goes into their bio's.  Waste!<br /><br />I'm not at all a fan of the BD books, and would rather have a jewel case (as ugly as they can be) but I am surprised that Fincher didn't make another nice digipack as he did for Social Network (which is packaged beautifully, I might add)  Perhaps this is an ideal item for a gift for someone that hasn't seen the film... I dont know.  The disc doesn't disappoint, but the packaging is whatever.  At least they could have removed the butt-ugly blue bar on the cover!incher that simply goes into their bio's.  Waste!

0316098337|4.0|I just finished reading it in a day during  a snowstorm. I read it for a Book Club and will be interested to see what the other members think. They are all in their 20's and 30's with no experience of working with trauma victims. I work  with people from birth to 101 ,mostly children with sensory needs. Many of those needs are from sensory disintegration,some stemming from trauma. I got stuck a few times on very unrealistic responses Jack would have such as riding through a car wash. I have worked with children where I have needed to stop the wash and back out. This shook my trust in the authors knowledge. I would have liked to have seen a golden thread woven throughout allowing us to experience the writing coming from a more thorough researched background in trauma recovery. I know it's only a story but we gain insight from everything,don't we?  I would recommend it to others to shake us out of our patterns,  to appreciate life more and to see it through the very innocent eyes of those who experience everything differently..
030746363X|5.0|Besides the fact that Tim Ferriss appears to be the most accessible author ever encountered, the advice in the book is manageable and helpful. The blog, online bonus material and countless links to products makes performing your own body experiments much much MUCH simpler. Even though I don't have the time nor the resources (stay-at-home-mom of two and three-year old girls) of the author to completely remake my, Ferriss brings the mountain to the reader. He outlines the most bare-bones ways to read the book to get what you want. The book is so accessible and written in such a fun, self-deprecating way you want to read the whole thing, and then invite Tim over for some Yerba Mate and a pizza. As he mentioned beans get can get a little boring, but I am not hungry AT ALL and it takes the power away from food. I was so sick of weighing and consulting my calorie books and websites, so this is a great alternative. Thank you, Tim Ferriss, for your hard work and OCD!
B003EYVXUU|5.0|First off, if you're comparing this film to the original, that's a mistake. I like the original because I was surprised at the simplicity of it. It was simple, straight forward film making and it was able to convey what all fine films convey, an emotional experience.          Let me in is its own film and if compared to the original I would say that this version also created an emotional experience, but a much deeper and richer one. Neither version of the novel stick to it loyally. In the novel, the character of the old man who goes out in hunt for blood for Eli or Abby or whoever is a pedophile, doscovered by Eli when he was an older man, not when he was a child. Neither movie makes that clear. There is a separate plot line in the novel about an older friend of Oskars whose mother is having a relationship with the officer in charge of capturing the old man(Elis renfield) that is not touched on in either film.Also, in the novel the old man returns as a vampire monster because Eli/Abby does not break his neck after drinking his blood at the hospital window.          I think the the remake captured the tone of the loneliness that both Owen and Abby feel as a result of her vampire existence and his lack of friends. Abby gives Owen the ability to care about himself and Owen gives Abby the ability to let herself care about somebody else. Most excellent.Simple,yet very affective.
B003UYV08E|4.0|I received this DVD in advance of the earliest arrival date, so delivery was excellent.  I bought the DVD used, and there was a minor glitch in the playback at one point.  I haven't watched it a second time to see if it was a permanent issue, but it's not the kind of thing that you like to see the first time you watch something--new or used--that you can't return.  But I weigh it out like this: The DVD was pretty cheap, arrived super quick, and by the end of the year I'll probably switch over to Blu-Ray anyway, so I'm not too worried about it.  If I could, I'd give them a 4.8, 4.9, but since it was not exactly perfect, I cannot give it a five star rating.  I have not contacted the seller about the issue, so I don't know what the customer service would be like, but they delivered what they said they would, cheap and quickly, and about the seller I have no complaints.  I would recommend them again!
B003102JDM|1.0|I had to counter the deep thinkers that have some how analyzed this totally plot less wanderings to be worthy of comment.  After reading one review that claimed this travesty to art was  \\"witty and engaging (containing) lessons (that)are true and wise (and we should )Be ready for a little action, a few contemplative chuckles, and a lot of food for thought\\".  I can only say, finish your Tom and Jerry comic and get a book with words.
B002ZG980U|5.0|This is one of the best films I've seen ever and if it doesn't win the Best Picture Oscar this year, it will be yet another miss by the Academy.  Inception makes the best use of the medium of any film made last year.  Original, mind bending storytelling, striking visual effects, expert cinematography, and comprehensive direction all integrated in one breathtaking film.  But, my feelings on Inception aside, let me review the actual, physical product.  This DVD is great if you really just want to watch the movie.  There are some bonus features, but not as many as you'll find on the Special Edition or Blu-Ray version, so if you're into that, I'd go somewhere else.  For me, I just couldn't see that movie again fast enough and since I don't have a Blu-Ray player or an HD television, it didn't seem necessary to get all of the extras at this point.  The DVD that I received was exactly as described on Amazon, there were no surprises.  It was really cheap and it arrived at my home faster than the earliest expected delivery date.  When I'm looking to replace my DVD with Blu-Rays, I will definitely consider this seller again!
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I am a little disappointed in the complete series. I clicked on it first and did not see the movie in the set. My husband also did not realize it. So when the offer came up for the movie, I thought oh good, I wanted it too. Now I have two movies and spent money I didn't have to.    I think those special offers should be watched more carefully by Amazon. I may not be the only unhappy customer.
B004BJMEO6|5.0|VERY well written, the storyline flows seamlessly, is easy to follow, and actually builds to a plausible conclusion!The actresses are believable, and the chemistry between the two is warm, and obvious. The movies'camera work has matching action and fluidity throughout-never showing any cheap, or hard cut scenes...I was drawn into the ladies story, and enjoyed feeling as if I was there with them, watching the story unfold. I would definitely buy this movie to add to my collection, not only as an addition because of the gay storyline, but as a wonderful love/life story as well.
B002ZG981E|5.0|This movie was one of the best movies that I have ever seen. It keeps you interested in what is going on throughout the entire movie, not just the end or the beginning. It has a small amount of humor, and a lot of content that gets you thinking. Inception is one of those movies that gets you wishing you were working in the film industry, for those of us who don't, or present during the filming. The film also has great replay value because the viewer is able to pick up on new things with each new watching.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This movie is well acted and believe it or not....suspenseful while being hilarious in many scenes!  We were all extremely pleased with all the actors performances and the storyline too!  I would definitely recommend it. (PS-The storyline doesn't seem THAT far fetched considering the CIA we are learning about)
B001676320|5.0|An excellent dvd well produced and the music from both the groups is just the best,the new artist appearing with earth wind & fire compliments the group so well.Chicago still the talent of yester year, But puting a new twist to meet the cuurent generation musically, thanhs to the both groups for keeping me happy.
0061726826|5.0|There's a quote by Oscar Wilde that says, \\"Keep love in your heart. A life without it is like a sunless garden when the flowers are dead. The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and richness to life that nothing else can bring.\\"<br /><br />This is Delirium. This is the world that Lena Holoway lives in--a world without love. A world, in my head, that is a lot like this quote: sunless, poor, dead.<br /><br />Forty-three years ago, the government developed a cure for amor deliria nervosa, a disease that caused impaired judgment, uncontrollable thoughts, rapid heartbeat, an inability to function, a disturbed state of mind. Fever. Restlessness. Illusions.<br /><br />At the age of eighteen, every person receives this cure and becomes a member of society. They can live after that, free from the worries and delirium that amor deliria nervosa causes. What is the cure? The government removes a part of the brain that controls amor deliria nervosa--love. Love destroyed the world until The Cure.<br /><br />Lena is counting down the days, ready, willing. She wants to start this new life they have planned for her. Of course, then the unthinkable happens. She meets Alex--and falls in love.<br /><br />The world Lauren Oliver created is haunting. Imagine a world where everyone simply is. Parents feel no affection toward their children. Wives feel no affection toward their husbands. People don't love each other. Everyone plans your life and you simply follow. I can only imagine it because of this book, this moving, hopeful, devastating book.<br /><br />Lena is good protagonist. At first, she's not that interesting. Not that extraordinary and overly cautious. She cares too much and not enough. Then, a boy laughs and her whole world is turned upside down. That's the moment I loved her. Everything that happens after that is a whirlwind of romance and discovery and hope in the midst of despair. The secrets that Lena learns--and how she handles them--really show all that she's risking and all that she's lost. It's amazing to see her discover the sunlight.<br /><br />Alex is the boy she falls in love with. He's everything she shouldn't want and everything she does. They are star-crossed lovers in every sense of the word. And being such, you have this feeling the whole time that it won't end well for them. But you want it to. You root for them. Alex is cultured and smart and very swoon-worthy. He helps Lena, guides her, pulls the strength out of her. Their romance is one of the few in YA that's completely developed and justified. You fall in love with them. You feel the appeal of this boy and his world.<br /><br />Not only is the story amazing, the writing--oh the writing. I could take a highlighter to this book and highlight the beautiful lines that exist. The whole book would be yellow. The prose is so poetic yet simple. They speak volumes to what Lena is feeling--what it would be like to discover this wonderful thing that you never knew existed. I won't spoil anything but just know that is the first in a series. If you don't know that, the ending will devastate you. It leaves you hanging!<br /><br />Delirium really stands out for me. I actually gave it to a friend--who doesn't read YA at all--and she adored it. She said she cried. When we met up again, I asked her why and she said, \\"It was devastating and beautiful.\\"<br /><br />That's a very fitting line. Everything about Delirium is devastatingly beautiful. It's a love story that will haunt you and make you wonder if all those songs about the world needing love and being love (and love in general,) really have a point after all. And the biggest question of all: What would the world be like without love?<br /><br />For more of my reviews, visit my blog: [...]mazing to see her discover the sunlight.

0525423273|5.0|The story starts on Twitter. (Not ANNA's, mine.) It was one night in July when my friend Andye was talking about ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS. I said I wanted to read it, even though I really didn't know much about it. So, she sent it and I read it in about five glorious, glorious hours. Ever since it's been love.<br /><br />Anna is shipped off to boarding school for her senior year. Away from her best friend and her little brother. Nothing good can come of being France. She doesn't speak the language or know the culture and she doesn't want to be there. The one good thing: the school her father chose for her is for Americans. It doesn't take long before she makes a great set of friends, one of whom is Etienne St. Clair. (Everyone calls him St. Clair.) An American raised in England who speaks fluent French, St. Clair is everything she wants. He's sweet, cute, funny--he also has a girlfriend.<br /><br />So, Anna shoves him to the \\"just friends\\" shelf, even though she hopes for more. Throughout this book, their friendship grows and develops on real levels. They connect over movies, their mutual friends, loss and they even argue. There are times I want to punch St. Clair for being a jerk. Stephanie does a great job of developing the characters in the story--more than only Anna and St. Clair. The friendships are real and grow together as the time passes between them. Each friendship faces challenges, resolutions and I like that. It's a very real story.<br /><br />In all this though is the story of a girl and a boy. It's not over-done or typical. Stephanie infuses LOTS of great qualities and real emotions.  It's hilarious. It's sad and frustrating. It's sweet and chocked full of internal thoughts and lively dialogue. If you are a girl, you have to read it! It's one of my favorite books of the year. You will fall in love with Anna and St. Clair and Paris--and you'll be waiting, hoping, wondering if Anna will get her french kiss from the boy who has her heart. (And mine. And yours, once you read this.)<br /><br />Final thoughts: Buy yourself a copy. Buy your friend a copy. It will not disappoint.<br /><br />For more of my reviews visit my blog: [...]s.)

B00328G4XY|5.0|This blows me away every time i hear it im not exaggerating.  It makes the hairs on the back of my neck tingle.  Jimis guitar playing is so amazing and complex this is pure talent.  Anyways i love every song on this album and also noel redding and mitch mitchell are great too.
0060936223|3.0|Much in this autobiography is moving, although for me the hagiography of Mapplethorpe is not. But one comes away from this pedestrianly-written, humorless book (flat, cliche-drenched style; we are told almost everything, shown almost nothing) liking and admiring Patti Smith. But from one who considers herself a poet, where IS that poetry? Since I'm almost an exact contemporary and from New York and Jersey, it was a bit of nostalgia seeing a lost slice of that world again. And I put \\"Patti Smith Radio\\" on Pandora and listened to the music as I read. It brought the natural to life, gave it an edge that's missing on the page. (By the way, try that while reading the new Sinatra bio and Keith Richards' book.) On balance, the book is definitely worth a read but not a rave.
B00280LYIC|4.0|As a casual fan of ancient mythology, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and plan to read the others in the series. Percy Jackson, 6th grade demigod, takes on the monsters of antiquity who are still alive today as he sets out across the USA (and to Hades and Olympus) to find out who stole Zeus' lightning, a crime for which he is being blamed. The gentle humor and kid-friendly action are winsome, and the integration of modern technology and real American places with the personalities and plotlines of Greek mythology was clever but not overbearing. Put simply, it works, and if you enjoy young adult fiction and have an interest in classical myths you will almost certainly enjoy this page-turner. So why not give it five stars? I hope and assume that in future books Percy and his friends move on from their relative one-dimensionality.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|it works well for a pocket device, not something you want the kids using and not for kitchen use either...too small with no gaurd
B00001U0DP|4.0|When Guido, his wife, and young son (about 4 years old) are forced into a concentration camp, Guido has 2 parenting choices to make.  He can either tell his son the cold, hard truth or lie to him, thus preserving his childhood innocence.  Guido chooses the latter.  Now, realistically, Guido's antics wouldn’t work. However, if you're willing to suspend disbelief, then you're in for a touching story about the lengths a father will go to protect his son.   Because his son isn’t gullible – he challenges his father repeatedly – there’s added suspense whether Guido can pull this off.    The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is because the movie starts slow.  I kept wondering where it was going.  Once the family enters the concentration camp, though, the real point of the story begins.  And the ending stayed with me for days afterwards.
B000FC2PKG|5.0|Ok so perhaps I'm being cynical. There's nothing about reading this novel alone that is scary as others have suggested, but that doesn't take away from the fact that it is an increasingly complex whodunit. It has twists and turns that leave you in deep thought and trying to figure out \\"what the what\\" is going on throughout the entire development of the story (but not in a bad way). The characters are compelling, intriguing, and somehow you're able to empathize with each and every one (well almost). It is a page-turner; you won't want to put it down. I'm looking for my next Lisa Gardner novel and hoping it won't disappoint.  I would love to find another author, who I can rely on time and time again to take me on a thrill-seeking, bone-chilling joyride. There aren't very many of those.
B002ZG98UK|5.0|When i bought this 3D bluray I knew I was in for a treat\\"Come on 3D zombie action!\\"     Well guess what i wasn't let down for a second. Not only did the move showcase real 3D It also was true to the game....kinda.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I love watching this movie.  Ms. Zellweger provides a stellar performance as Miss Beatrix Potter. The portrayal of her is delightful.  The story itself is inspiring for someone wondering if they should take on a dream such as writing a book. The fact that so much of the movie is filmed on location is a plus. England is such a beautiful place.  It is a treat to watch the movie and learn about the historical background of Miss Potter, the lady who wrote and illustrated so many lovely children's stories we've all read, enjoyed and shared with our own children. She inspires one to be strong and insistent concerning her creation, and yet provides an excellent example of honoring her parents in spite of (her mother's) unfair demands.  After watching the movie, it made me want to get out her great works to not only re-read them but to study her watercolor techniques and appreciate them all the more -- all over again!
1603420398|5.0|I was blown away with the possiblities.  Doilies are NOT just round and extravagantly created 'masterpieces' that would go beyond the average person's ability to concoct.<br /><br />This book gives the reader endless possibilies for color usage, joinage,and ending product results.<br /><br />Being a novice, I am thrilled with the prospect of trying these, of course the 'signs' for the various stitch types is very clear and helpful, and affords easy to follow instructions-- so different from those old abbrev.(which really resembled hiroglphics to the unitiated.)
B0002EXH54|5.0|There is a lot of nonsense posted about Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?, for example this is not Chris Poland's last recordings with the band as he plays on extended tracks of Rust in Peace and  The System Has Failed. There is a lot of nonsense posted about who is the best Megadeth guitarist, well I reckon Dave Mustaine actually changed his style between his Metallica stuff (just listen to their demos and the early Megadeth demos) and the first two Megadeth albums, I think his main influence must have been Poland. Marty plays a very clean type of rock solo, he's great but he really comes later and made Megadeth a more commercial sound for mass media. The Poland-Mustaine guitar style is more unique and interesting, it isn't just developed from a lot of guitar school. It makes you wonder if Poland was teaching Mustaine guitar over the early period of Megadeth, an interesting hypothesis as Chris then pops up later at key moments in the band's history, certainly Mustaine has become a good and interesting guitarist himself. If you want to hear how good the guitar gets then just check out the last solo on My Last Word. Anyway, a classic album...go buy.
0761119752|2.0|It's too active for bedtime, not calming down until the very last page, and it just doesn't flow well anyway.  I don't like it at all.
B002LVUKIS|5.0|Excellent series of games.   If anyone is having any issues getting these games to run can visit the ttlg forums for help (it's not that difficult).
B004CLYKLI|5.0|Being a big fan of the public library I don't buy as many books as I borrow but I purchased this book for a snowy day and I'm glad I own it. Love the parenting style or not you will not be able to put this book down. Lessons to be learned, humor, fascinating. Suffice to say while I'm glad Amy is not my mother, I am amazed and impressed with the children she and Jed have raised.
B000SEJHRA|5.0|A friend recommended the works of David Sedaris as wonderful pieces of comic relief. She insisted upon Me Talk Pretty One Day as an introduction to his style and I'm so very glad I followed my friend's advice. I found David's writing to be very conversational and easy to comprehend, and therefore fully appreciate his brand of humor. The ability to laugh at the foibles of self and loved ones is such a gift, and David shared it beautifully. I found myself giggling out loud and wanting to share particularly funny passages with perfect strangers. I'll definitely buy additional Sedaris books.
B003YF9PWC|5.0|What can I say, well Stallone's first written film in the Rocky series titled \\"Rocky\\" is more than just a masterpiece, its a classic. How can we forget the sling of supporting characters, the unforgettable story that anyone, no matter what their background and have a impact on the society. Rocky sure as hell did. And we all rooted for him! For Christmas I got a HD cable to go from my Playstation 3 to the TV and thanks to the HD cable, I get to experience the amazing High Definition Blu-Ray experience with Rocky!

B000001FFJ|5.0|This is just such a fabulous album I don't even know what to say about it. Each song is a mini-masterpiece.    The first time I heard Rain Dogs, in 1994, it was so different from everything I had ever heard, so weird, that I wanted to reject it and all of its fans as pretentious. Fool! Fool! If loving this album makes one a pretentious fop, then let me be chairman of the board of the pretentious fop club.    No, this is just amazing stuff, an album that fills me with gratitude and wonder.
0446679089|1.0|Someone at a party recommended this book to me.  I had never read Nelson DeMille before.  Which turns out to be good for me.  This novel has nothing going for it.  Start with a totally adolescent, obnoxious main character and work your way down from there.  John Corey is not in the least bit likable, has a \\"clever\\" joke (unfunny) for every occasion, and tries oh so hard to convince you he's the smartest guy in the room.  Gosh, he's so good at what he does you never get the sense he's ever in any real danger.    Next, make sure to disappoint your readers.  A bright young couple who were scientists on Plum Island are found murdered.  Anyone expecting this as a launch for a taut scientific thriller, as the title might suggest, is in for a letdown.  There is a \\"twist\\" in the middle of the story -- unfortunately it introduces a subject matter far more inane and much less challenging to write about.  Of course right from the start we get an inkling of this twist to come, as out of all the minds investigating the case only our hero John Corey suspects something might not be what it seems....    We're introduced to a lot of characters.  Town police, county police, FBI and CIA.  There's a day-long excursion of Plumb Island, which feels like it covers at least 100 pages.  Among a large collection of government employees, we meet an intriguing Dr. Zollner.  The investigators coerce him to lead them on an extensive tour of the lab.  He seems like an amiable fellow, outwardly helpful, but perhaps a little mysterious?  Hmmm, what sinister secret could he be hiding?  How about the other lab staffers -- the ones who worked closely with the murdered couple?  They're helpful too, but somehow a little scripted in their responses, as Corey surmises.  What might they have up their sleeves?  Turns out nothing!  After this tour, none of them are ever heard from again!  Oh, and that little scene where John Corey kind of \\"zones out\\" at the spectacle of an unfortunate animal in the last stages of a hemorrhagic virus?  No, it's not a foreshadowing of some significant event to come.  He just has this \\"thing\\" about seeing a living thing bleed out of its nose and anus.    Shortly after, the ranking members of the investigation decide they are no longer in need of Corey's services.  But Corey continues his investigation on the sly.  Now out of the loop and denied access to more advanced resources, he has to take his quest on foot.  By his own admission old-fashioned detective work is dull and tedious.  The problem is he is absolutely right.  The reader suffers though endless questioning of crusty elderly people and a prickly, effeminate vineyard owner.  One of his leads in an attractive young historian  who naturally falls in love with him in the space of one afternoon ...because he's just so damn charming.  How does he repay her for their tryst?  Why, with a chamber pot, naturally.  I kid you not.    Okay, so on to the conclusion.  By this time even DeMille must have realized what a dog he had on his hands, what with characters who disappeared and the storyline dead ends.  So in an effort to save a story that couldn't stand on it's own, he falls back on that timeless, cliched literary device: \\"the storm.\\"  A hurricane just so happens to hit the eastern end of Long Island.  It makes apprehending the real killer just a little more difficult for Corey as he chases him towards Plum Island on the high seas.  But no worries; while piloting a boat for the first time, dodging rifle fire, cracking wise, and yes, swilling a couple of beers, our hero has everything under control.  It all makes for a wild and riveting climax on Plum Island!  Not.    The rear inner sleeve of the book I had said something like \\"Be sure not to miss these other Nelson DeMille novels featuring detective John Corey....\\"  Oh, you can bet I will do exactly that.
B002SR2PKG|4.0|I read this book years after the mini series came on tv. of course i loved it. one of those where i had to sleep with the lights on after reading it.
0307272702|5.0|I am several chapters into the book and am enjoying it very much.  I had read a Reader's Digest article written about Taubes and his scientific evidence about why we get fat.  It intrigued me so much that I bought his book on Amazon.  I have not been disappointed!      The premise of the book is that obesity is a hormonal problem.  Carbohydrates raise your insulin and causes fat to be stored and if you do not have an insulin spike then your fat will be burned as fuel.  We are to no longer look at a package and count fat grams and calories - which was what I was doing before this book.  Instead look at the carbohydrates and sugar content.  I had always suspected the gov't guidelines or pyramid wasn't right - especially when it came to how many grains we are to take in.  It seemed excessive.      Also, Taubes makes very interesting arguments about the Pima people and \\"Fat Louisa\\" in that the quality of the food matters not the quantity we are taking in.  He refutes the idea that fat people are fat because they are \\"lazy\\" or \\"eat too much.\\"  His evidence is really something to consider.  If we are trying to understand this problem in America, Taubes and his data need to be seriously considered!    He also states we are to seriously AVOID liquid carbohydrates such as beer, fruit juices, and soda.  I always knew that soda was a horrible culprit for obesity.  The people that are so grossly overweight that can't even get out of their houses - what do they drink all day? SODA.      Also another point is that we are very focused on exercise these days, but our waistlines are not decreasing.  I am glad that Taubes also attacked the myth about obesity being falsely tied to wealth.  In fact, the opposite is true.  How interesting.      I highly recommend this book.  I think we have been all wrong in our thinking about what makes people fat in this country and all over the world.  This scientific evidence should be investigated and examined so the world can help those that are miserably overweight.    BTW, I decided to give the ideas in this book a two week trial.  I have been on the low carb recommendations for almost 2 weeks now.  I have never felt unsatisfied and have eaten well, yet LOST 5 POUNDS.  I am going to keep going.  Also, just to give you some hope, the first week is hard because you have cravings for sweets (at least I did).  Push through it because the second week has been fine with no cravings.  Best of luck to everyone trying this way to keep ourselves at a healthy weight for life.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the best book in the whole world. YOU HAVE TO READ IT!!!You won't regret it, i promise. No one I know as read this book and not liked it. I STRONGLY reccomend reading this. You are almost guarenteed to love this book and all the action, romance and suspense.

B003VB5D84|1.0|After watching the great 2004 version I was expecting some improvement. To my disapointment the camera crew stole their money.  It seemed that kids were behind the cameras. Obviously Eric Claptom contracted non-musicians probably to save $$$ but BIG MISTAKE.  This is evidenced because when solos were being performed, the camera was filming something other than \\"hands-on-guitar\\" shots.    DO NOT WAST YOUR MONEY ON THIS VERSION.  GET THE 2004.
B0028R3NCU|5.0|This is the sleekest USB I have ever seen.  It is very slimline and convenient when you're on the go.  I hook this to my phone and bring it to school.  It comes in handy when you want to save something in the computer lab, show your friends photos, or transfer the microSD to your phone to view pdfs in class.  It's fast and I haven't had any problems with it.  I use a mac and the PCs at school.  Works great.  Super convenient and doesn't look dorky hanging it on a keychain/phone.  Also, if you're worried about wear and tear, don't.  I throw mine around in my bag with my keys where it can get scratched and haven't had a problem.
030746363X|5.0|Despite Tim's warning not to read the book straight-through, I found it impossible not to do so. His writing style entertains and kept me coming back for more. The most useful information in the book matches what I've read before in The Primal Blueprint, Healthy Mind Fit Body, or other paleo-focused books and blogs. The most surprising aspect of the book is how physically large it is compared to 4HWW.
B002ZG980U|5.0|I bought this on DVD because when I watched the movie in theaters, I knew I would want to buy it in the future. It's one of the few movies I can watch over and over again without being bored. The story is compelling and the concept of dreams is thought provoking.     The only con is the lack of special features at the end. They showed several -short- behind the scenes videos about certain scenes in the movie..except for the famous hotel rotating scene with the sexy Joseph Gordon Levitt. Other than that I have no complaints.    I also bought this movie because everyone (yes even the older guys) were \\"pretty\\". Also so I could see Mr. Levitt anytime I wanted haha!
B003JTHESA|3.0|I expected this album to be equal or better than their last album but it failed miserably.It's just too repetitive,the songs the guitar work sounds the same almost in every song,it's like they couldn't find a different rhythm to them.The title says it,if it had been their last it would have bombed big time.
0740785508|5.0|This is a great collection of tips of how to draw what does not exist, like dinosauruses, space crafts, cyborgs and imaginative cities. The artist shows first how he has sketched the idea of the original picture, how he has used the colors to show the mood and the shadows to draw the attention to some details.<br />This is not for beginners. You need to know something about drawing, sketching, painting in order to try these out. However, just the illustrations of this book are great! I would recommend this to anyone.
0451196716|5.0|The Long Walk is a great book, my first GOOD Stephen King book. Even though its a Bachman book and some dont consider this a true SK book, it does not fail to grab you a great book. Not at all scary just a thriller. I recomend anybody who liked The Running Man. Same concept also if you liked this book I recomend The Hunger Games. Even though its a young adult book its still a good series. Also if you liked the Hunger Games this is the book for you. Still not for kids.
0374264260|4.0|I think it is fascinating that the obsessive thoughts and magical thinking of mentally ill narrator are considered inappropriate to the point that he was committed to a mental institution for several years; but similar obsessive and magical thinking, when adapted and accepted by a larger group in the public (football fans - including the narrator's therapist) are considered to be perfectly legitimate. Now that's hilarious!
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I love this series. I have all 5 of the seasons out so far and I am hooked 100%. The relationship between Dean and Sam is so typical of brothers. Each episode has me on the edge of my seat and when I reach the end I have to watch just 1 more and before i know it I have watched the whole disc. I highly recommend this show to anyone young or old that whats good entertainment.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|You will watch this movie again and again. Others have detailed the pros and cons of the movie, and I am glad we got to see it on the big screen with surround sound. The DVD does not disappoint at all, and the bonus features are everything we hoped they would be, at least the ones that pertain to the movie. This is a movie, not a documentary, but hopefully it will introduce Secretariat to new fans and a new appreciation for the horse and his story. Hopefully, they will seek to know more after seeing the film and find the resources they need in books and on the Internet.      Secretariat captures something that many people do not understand -- why stock men and women invest and risk everything in their animals and decisions, the chance to produce the best. Nothing is certain, though everyone tries for a winner, you never know for sure what you're going to get any breeding program. When you produce a champion, it is a miracle, and when they win, it is cause for so much jubilation. The choice of \\"Oh Happy Day\\" was spot on -- Rejoice every time you see this movie. It will lift you up and carry you each time you watch it...
B000003BDJ|5.0|this is one of my favorite cd's.  most of my favorite tunes are on it, like gimme shelter,satisfaction,brown sugar,jumping jack flash,and street fighting man.  these cd's literally rock.    I highly recomend this item.
030746363X|5.0|The 4 hour body offers a lot. Much more then the slow carb diet. For me however, the book offers exceptional value just by introducing me to a weight-loss diet that actually delivers on it's promises.     The proposed slow-carb diet, together with some mild exercises and a couple of pills made me loose 24 pounds in just one month. The best part? It does not feel like dieting at all. I believe that the strength of the slow carb diet lies in the fact that it is so simple:  Simple to follow the rules  Simple to integrate into my daily routine  Simply tasty food that doesn't make me feel like a pre-olympic gymnastic athlete.     I genuinely feel that the book offers a way for everybody to start living a healthier, even happier life. It did that for me, and i hope it will do that for you too!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I look forward to each of N.Sparks books, and was gripped by the story line immediately. A little more scary than his usual, but still a great story and a \\"can't put it down\\" book.   Keep it up, can't wait for the next one!
B000QFW7UA|5.0|What can I say? The included music video alone is worth the purchase. This movie takes me back to when I was a kid and had a heart full of hope. The packaging is amazing and the blu-ray transfer is okay. I dont see them remastering this anytime soon, so the transfer to blu-ray is a step in the right direction. Buy it, you wont regret it. From the movie magazine reproduction,\\"I will never betray my Goon Dock friends...We will stick together until the whole world ends...Through heaven and hell and nuclear war...Good pals like us will stick like tar...In the city, or the country, or the forest, or the boonies...I am proudly declared a fellow...GOONIE!\\"

1567184855|5.0|Journey of Souls is the first scientific effort to discover what life between lives is like. Dr Newton has interviewed under hypnosis some 7000 individuals, and they are all telling the same story with individual variations. Now his Institute has others adding confirmation to the basic facts: We do not die, we are eternal, we have soulmates whom we see between lives on earth, and sometimes on earth. We are here to learn from our experiences, and to grow toward enlightenment. Read the book and see if it does not resonate with you. As a scientist, I find it hard to refute. So many cases are corroborative. I have recommended Dr Michael Newton for a Nobel Prize in Physiology.

B000JQU4TW|3.0|I would love to give this a five star review because I am a great fan of Oscar Wilde from his well known works to De Profundis, but the inconsistancy of this story made it difficult to get into.<br />  The first half is a vehicle for Wilde's wit, unfortunately at the expense of story line and character developement, although I should that for me the wit of Oscar Wilde was reason enough to keep me reading. The second half of the book tells the majority of the story and is a much more accessable read.<br />  Would I reccomend this book? I think this is one of the few times I would say see the film (1945 starring George Saunders and Angela Lansbury) and then read the book. The book alone is not the best showcase for the genius of Oscar Wilde.
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|I'm reviewing the Blu~Ray aspects of the DVD, We all know the movie is a Masterpiece!  Ok, This is the Best Blu~Ray I own. The quality in every respect Is nothing short of OUTSTANDING!!!!...I have watched this Blu~Ray at least 6 times since I received it! Do yourself a favor and get this on Blu~Ray! you won't regret It!!!
0385341679|3.0|I really liked the first four of this series and was really excited when the last one finally was released.  I wish there had been an org chart at the beginning of the book because it was so long since I read the last one, it took me the first 100 pages just to remember the vocabulary and the \\"lore\\" of everything. I wished I had loved it, but it was just okay.  The editor needed to use her red pen more often and eliminate some of the clutter and overly long scenes of interspection.  The end left out some major characters and was a bit of a let down and some of the major questions were left unanswered.  Long story threads were tied up too abruptly at times and were vague in others.

B0010SKSTO|5.0|I've read a number of sociology/psychology type books, and the challenge with these books is conveying the science clearly and convicingly, while at the same time keeping things interesting. You usually have to trade-off one to get the other, which makes writing these books something of a balancing act. Navarro strikes that balance perfectly.    Scientifically, Navarro helps you conceptualize the broader principles underlying specific behaviours. This is a much better way to learn than just memorizing an array of individual \\"rules\\". For instance, Navarro categorizes behaviours within intuitive themes (e.g. \\"gravity defying behaviours\\"). Furthermore, every step of the way, Navarro provides a rational reason for why a behaviour indicates what he suggests it indicates. Navarro is also very good at distinguishing solid science (backed up by research), from logical conjecture that follows from his experience in the field.    In terms of keeping the book interesting, Navarro does an excellent job interlacing the science with anecdotes from his own experience as an FBI interviewer, and also reminding us where we might see behaviours in our daily lives. The end result is a book that feels incredibly relevant, and easy to read.    I first read the book several months ago, and have found that is not as relevant in real life as it seemed it would be on paper. In an FBI interrogation room, there is a lot of body language to read into. But I find that the application is more limited in real life, where people don't often experience such emotional extremes (and if they do, they usually don't hide it). Also, I've found that reading body language is something you have to work to get into the habit of doing. At least in my experience, it requires a lot of conscious effort. The best use of body-language reading is in things like dates, and job interviews, where people DO try to conceal what they're really feeling.
B001NXDSLQ|5.0|It was perfect brand new in the wrapping i have had no problems with it and i would buy from this company/person again.! This is a must buy for any fan of the 60's. This DVD is the climax of what hippie culture was. I wish people would still feel this way about the world. I am 21 years old, my father was 18 in 1969 and went to Woodstock. He always says about how peaceful it was and yes they used drugs, but it wasn't to make money like today it was to explore their minds in ways. Sad thing is we're at this point again where people of our generation could make something like this happen with all the war and revolutions going on around the world. Matter a fact it is happening on a smaller scale. Anyone who is interested in going to a Peaceful music and arts festival. Search Bonnaroo Music & Arts festival. I went in 2010 and it was the most peaceful expierence i have ever had 3 days of fun, peace and music in Tennesee.
B004E547D8|1.0|Great movie, highly recommended!    However, this Blu-ray does not carry a lossless audio track (mentioned in other reviews), and Amazon uses the same description for other Blu-rays which DO have Lossless audio.  Amazon's Description states:    Format: AC-3, Color, Dolby, Subtitled, Widescreen    If you go to the page for The Dark Knight [Blu-ray], you will see the EXACT same description -- Word for word!  And The Dark Knight DOES have a Dolby True HD Lossless soundtrack.  Since lossless is standard on the majority of Blu-rays, and they Amazon the same description for Blu-rays carrying lossless audio, this leads consumers to believe the Red Blu-ray also has lossless audio.    I have returned this (opened) Blu-ray for a refund, citing \\"Different From Web Site Description\\" as the reason.  Since other Blu-rays with lossless Dolby True HD audio carry the exact same description, this is a legitimate reason for full refund.    Amazon needs to review their policy and start giving more accurate descriptions of their Blu-rays.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|Much has been said about the socialist overtones in the novel and the movie. This is of no consequence now.  The Grapes of Wrath and Dead End were the only two movies coming out of the 30's showing the social upevels of the time. This movie has been discussed to death; its John Ford's masterpiece.  In my opinion, the rigth way to look at it is that it is an important piece of AMERICANA. The movie deviates some from the novel, showing a more human and optimistic outlook, and rightly so. For comparison, the big band was also a big piece of AMERICANA that started at the same time, a magnificent introduction of a new, optimistic, uniquely American music.  This is our heritage, and I am thankful to all the talented people who made this possible.
B002ZG99NG|3.0|I really like the new Ben Affleck . I thought his directorial debut GONE BABY GONE was one of the very finest pictures of its year . I thought he was teriffic in STATE OF PLAY and that that film was quite a good picture . I'm old enough and film curious to have seen a lot of similar films to THE TOWN over the decades . My wife and i watched all but about a half an hour of the film and really dug it (then had to crash) . It was very successful in ratcheting up the tension during this period . The following day , \\"Boom\\" , it's HEAT (and a thousand others) and the career criminal with a heart-a-gold . Time to leave Beantown Ben . Solid effort undermined . It happens . No ill will . Brilliant cast . Three quarters of a very good film . 3 and 1/2 star out of five .

B000GCFY0I|5.0|i loved this book! it was perfect in every way. the characters were good in addition to the emotions they expressed. i aso like how the book included romance but not so much that it made the book boring. there was a good balance. i also love that through every page you stay hooked. you never want to put the book down, there is just so much excitment. the one thing i didn't like about this novel is that it left you hanging at the end, although it did have a second book so all ended good. overall, i LOVED the everything!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|omg... i loved this book    please read it if u can because it is one of the most epic books ever...also for those who have read the third book......... go team gale!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B002361MJC|3.0|This book is a challenge to get through. Take out all the repitition and you would have a book one eighth of the size and to the point.

B003L77G2Y|5.0|As I said in the title, Fringe is the best SF show on TV today. It has plenty of mythology, character development, and just plain cool stuff, and the season is just getting better and better with each episode. If you haven't seen the show yet, I don't know why you're reading reviews for season 3... so go start watching from the beginning!    Additionally, the performances by the cast are amazing considering what is being asked of them this season. Walter Noble especially is deserving of an Emmy nomination and hopefully this year is the year. It's a shame that solid SF shows rarely get recognized as they deserve.

0071752854|5.0|Oren is brilliant.    AND effective.     If I could trace the origin of \\"The Frame\\" as used by pitchmen, presenters, persuaders and anybody who transfers value to others in what is basically the selling process, I might be able to show you how smart and brilliant I am, but I'm going to get over myself for just a moment here and bow to Oren's amazing accomplishment with the book, Pitch Anything. Not merely the book, but Oren's talented use of framing to persuade.     One minute into his book and I could care less about his NLP & Hypnosis training or how smart the guy is because here's this guy who just kills it in the boardroom with his seamless closing skills...by the millions and millions and millions.     Who DOES that?    Oren Klaff. That's who.    As a persuader and pitchman myself, I just admire a guy who is willing to share the secrets (the real secrets) to what works today, in THIS economy. Oren doesn't need the money. It's beyond needing money for him and I get that about him. You will too.     We all look through a frame. We see a picture of our world (in front of us). We move the frame around for new pictures. Sometimes others move the frame around for us or put in pictures they want us to look at. Sometimes the frame is bigger or smaller, by our will or somebody's influence and framing or reframing skills. Everything in this paragraph is me framing you. It's largely BS, but you be your own judge. Framing is just a word to describe a very, very real phenomena that makes selling and money getting in the transfer of your value to people who want, need, and crave your products and services--an amazing (and profitable) process.     Learn the process from Oren Klaff.    For twenty two bucks and a cup of coffee you can put on a million dollar frame and go DO something with your miserable sales career...finally!
B000002KDX|3.0|America started out squarely in folk rock, moving toward pop over the next few years. This debut album will most appeal to those who want something pleasant and innocuous to kick back with in the background. That's not to say there aren't a few memorable songs here. But the job of a good greatest hits album is to eliminate the need to purchase other albums, and for the casual fan America's compilations do a very good job of summarizing this album's highlights: the two singles that put America on the map, \\"A Horse With No Name\\" and \\"I Need You\\", and the enjoyable \\"Sandman\\".<br /><br />The rest of the album tends toward coffeehouse music, a bit of a period piece, a touch of the naivete of its era and the age of the performers at the time. Listen to \\"Three Roses\\" and you'll get flashbacks of every earnest coffeehouse solo singer with acoustic guitar that you've ever encountered.<br /><br />If you've already got a compilation and you'd like to fill out your America catalog a little more, the highlights of the remaining album cuts would be the three songs that follow \\"I Need You\\": \\"Rainy Day\\", \\"Never Found the Time\\" and \\"Clarice\\".<br /><br />The America album I would most strongly recommend is the followup, the second album [[ASIN:B002YRVUZG Homecoming]]. All in all it did a fine job of retaining some folk rock as some pop sounds were beginning to make incursions. It even had some upbeat songs for a change in \\"Don't Cross the River\\" and \\"California Revisited (Everyone I Meet Is From California)\\". The strange or abrasive touches from the first album that showed a band still in transition from the 1960s, most evident in \\"Pigeon Song\\" and \\"Donkey Jaw\\", had dissipated by the second album and you had a group that was fully grown into their sound. The songwriting had developed from the promising sound evident on the first album to the songs themselves being able to stand on their own. Although it's available for individual downloads, that's one of those albums that's worth having in its entirety.<br /><br />If the pop side of America is more to your liking, [[ASIN:B00123IADS Hearts (US Internet Release)]] does the best job in that regard. If all you have is a greatest hits, you probably have its three hits and that will do you well, but if you choose to dip into that album it's a pretty good likelihood that you'll be glad you added it to \\"Homecoming\\" and [[ASIN:B003WO0UAQ The Complete Greatest Hits (US Release)]].ing in its entirety.<br /><br />If the pop side of America is more to your liking, [[ASIN:B00123IADS Hearts (US Internet Release)]] does the best job in that regard.

0385341679|5.0|This is a short review, because it's very hard to write anything with out giving anything of the series away. Shadowfever was a great end to this series answering all my questions!

B000REQT86|4.0|\\"Nosferatu\\" is, without a doubt, one of the most influential films of all time. But let's clear a few issues with this particular product first. Being a silent film from the early 1920's, all the dialogue and narrations are \\"subtitled,\\" lacking a better word for it. These are actually moments where the screen goes completely black, while the text, presented in bold white typeface is displayed. Fine. This is how a typical silent film was made. But this version of the film is presented in full-screen, thus cropping the edges of the text, leaving the viewer to guess exactly what the last part of the passages say. People have complained about the screen changing colors throughout the story, but these people didn't understand that was how night and day shots were differentiated back then. This version (the one I have) doesn't have that, and where it makes the film more consistent, there's very little to tell you which scenes are at night, and which are in the day. Of course, Orlock can only survive at night, but the modern viewer is taken out of this as a time piece. And \\"Orlock's\\" name is the other issue. Murnau's film changed the character's names because of copyright issues to avoid being sued by Bram Stoker's publisher, and where the original prints had Dracula's name as \\"Count Orlock\\" (more sinister sounding, I think), this print uses the \\"Dracula\\" name in the film, but the \\"Orlock\\" name in the packaging. If you are young and uninformed, but still want to watch it, you may be confused, as this happens to various characters within. Consistency is VERY important to me in a book, movie, or TV show. And so many times, this idea is thrown to the four winds.<br /><br />There is no menu; you put it into your disc player, and right after the copyright warning, the film starts on its own, which doesn't have to be a bad thing, but when the film ends, it loops back to the beginning, forever replaying it until you physically turn it off.<br /><br />On to the pluses: The quality of the film is very good. It is sharp and clear, remarkable, given how old the film is, and the fact that Stoker's people had all known copies of the film destroyed. A copy or two slipped through the cracks, and we now have this masterpiece somewhat intact today. And a lot of people prefer it to the later interpretations, myself included.<br /><br />The appropriate good acting in a silent film, would be considered bad acting in a later film with sound, as all facial expressions and body movements had to be greatly exaggerated (wrist-to-the-forehead while one throws their head back with eyes closed, for example) for effect, and the actors needed heavy makeup to make their already over-the-top performances stand out better. With very little to go on, they used all at their disposal, and in this film, they did so to great effect. They leap off the screen.<br /><br />Music has been dubbed onto the soundtrack, and this gives the experience of being in a movie house at the time, when an organist was employed. And as a plus, there is some orchestration, a nice touch, given this is a much later time than before.<br /><br />And, of course, the story's two villians, Renfield and Orlock (I prefer calling him Orlock): Renfield is so deranged-looking in this movie, it almost makes one itch at the sight of him; large chrome-dome head, with an unruly ring of black and grey hair festooning in all directions, some black teeth, and a convincing look of insanity in his eyes. And check the eyebrows - holy crap! Just nasty all around. And Orlock, by any standard, is a terrifying sight. He is THE picture of corruption of the soul. Max Shreck portrays him with such conviction, my hat is off to him. He is tall and almost animal-like, with large dead eyes which NEVER blink. Watch him. Before he turns his head, he moves his eyes, then his face turns in their direction. He had a hooked shark-fin nose, long pointed ears, rodent-like teeth, long claw-like hands, and a stiff jerky walk which looks like that of a walking cadaver. There are two types of chills you can get up your back, the good kind and the bad kind. And he really can put the bad kind on you.<br /><br />I don't regret buying this particular version of this film; but if the formatting was better and the names in the titles were correct, it would have gotten a solid 5-star rating from me.oks like that of a walking cadaver.

B00005MCWZ|5.0|I like listening too all hawkwind cds and on older ones the singer on motorhead used too be on this band before he got fired from it an form motorhead.    Anyway I think hawkwind is much better than motorhead anyway.    Motorhead is alright, not some thing I'd listen too all da time but you get the picture.    Psychedelic rock rules over heavy metal!!!!    an hurry on sundown is like the only hawkwind song that sounds a bit country but it still good anyway.    Mirror of illision is the best song I like on the album.
0061537934|5.0|Really liked this book.  Wasn't sure at first since Enzo starts out in his latter years and was worried it was going to be too sad, but it turned out that there was just enough sadness to make you appreciate the love and joy of this family.  Worth a read.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Much has been written regarding this series, so I won't go into reviewing the performances of the lead actors, suffice to say (IMO),they did an excellent job of portraying the devious two faced back stabbing Romans. I found it very realistic, no punches pulled. If you are squeamish and can't handle blood, this is not for you, or if sex scenes and nudity offend you, once again this is not for you. I like movies where they show it as it really was, those things and the deceit and treachory etc. This is one of the few series to really grab me, because it pretty well does all that, very effectively. The heads and limbs severed, realistically, courtesy of our digital error is to make you shudder. This is definitely an adult series to be locked away if you have children. Unfortunately, from what I have been able to find out, there won't be a followup series.
0330449605|4.0|I was enthralled at first, then hit a point where i decided, \\"whoa, i don't think that i like where this is going.\\"  However, i stuck with it and and, in the end, liked the book.  The point concerning me was not developed into the main story line. Had it been, I really think that i probably would not have finished the book.  It is definitely not one that you can figure out the ending of early on which is,  to  me, a sign of a really good book.
B002ZG99IG|4.0|(review for movie, not DVD) Sara wants to be the small town girl that makes it in the big fashion world. she is currently going to school and hopes to make friends as well, and when Rebecca appears everything seems great. Sara has some new people in her life, things to see, fashions to produce. The only thing that seems to be standing adversely to that is the possessiveness she just starts to notice.<br /><br />In the vein of many a stalking movie, The Roommate makes its debut and has some hits and some misses. The good thing about the movie is that it has some really nice moments where it seems creepy. The roomate does a nice job being creepy and seemingly feared, and the moments seem to creep up and present themselves. From the small reflection of someone wathcing across the way to the moments when fear seems to carry a sharp utensil, there are times when the movie has fun. Sadly, some things detract from that.<br /><br />One thing in modern movies is the fact that the people seem a little fake. From the coffee houses to the party scene, the people seem like a Gap add. They dress a specific way and look a specifc type and the diversity that life offers seems to stay outside. You also have to buy into the notion that college rooms are big, and that is a hard one for anybody who has seen a dorm. Add to that the arrangements of some of the moments and the spacing and you might be a little wary. Still, these are problems with A LOt of new venues.<br /><br />If you like this genre offshoot then you will like this. If you do not, then this might not be for you. It is not bloody, does not have nudity in any form, and does not really offer a bleak looking canvas. some of it is mind and mind alone, and the images are left to the watcher. Some like that, however, and I like it enough. I would have given it a 3.5 or so, and the 4 it rounds to seems good. I am glad I saw it, but it would not have hurt to miss it.<br />I suppose it depends on the person.<br /><br />Thank you.
B002UJIY70|4.0|This movie was supposed to be one of those flicks with a crazy twist at the end. That it did but it wasn't exactly up there with The Sixth Sense. If you pay a Little attention you can figure out that the couple (Mila Jovovich and Steve Zahn) are not the people who they say they are and the moment I saw Steve light a butane burner I knew he was gonna cook some drug cause I have been to Hawaii and I couldn't figure why he was lighting it, I never did anything there that would need that type of burner.          The reason why I like this movie so much is for one, the local, Hawaii is so beautiful I was crying having to come back to Vegas (I am man enough to say I cried). I also liked it cause I am the type of guy that when I go places I kind of day dream about some extreme thing happening like serial killers stalking me as displayed in this movie. Of course in my dreams I save the day and everything goes well, same as Timothy Olyphant's character in this movie.          O.K. ow that you are totally confused let me tell a bit of the story. Steve and Mila are a couple on their honeymoon going on a hiking trip to a beautiful beach. Along the way they hear about news articles talking about some serial killing couple that has gone to their island. While hiking they run into Tim, decide to follow him as he seems savvy and can protect them from some people they pissed off on their drive to the trail head.          Next thing they know it Tim (who is an ex special forces guy) and his girlfriend seems really creepy (spoiler alert)and you think they may be the killers. But of course at the end it is found that Mila and Steve are the killers and they have Tim as their next target, the whole time they where playing the sheep and where the wolves.          This is where it gets good, Tim and his girlfriend slice and dice and fight to the bone and they save the day!!! Woo hoo, keep in mind though this movie is for entertainment not enlightenment or any awe factor just a good actionflick!!  [...]
B0040JHWKS|4.0|I'm a diehard Bruce fan myself....its hard not to please me. First off though,<br />if you purchase the CD expecting some continuence of Darkness on the Edge of Town...forget it! I thought before I bought the album that it might contain a similar sound and even expected it, but i don't know why.....I have the Tracks collection, and this disc reminds me more of \\"that\\" and its FINE. I like listening to almost anything Bruce does....I've seen him numerous times in concert and I'm a fan. I don't think a casual fan will like it. You get a nice version of Fire and<br />Because the Night, but if you're looking for some hits....no way. This is a CD to be listened to repeatedly. In some respects it reminds me of some stuff he does now.<br />Darkness on the Edge of Town is my Favorite Bruce disc......this one isn't close, but I love the Sound and I can't imagine here that would have been better then what was released on Darkness. A good buy for the diehard fan....a risk for the casual fan.<br /><br />Atreides
B002VPE1Z2|5.0|I use this AmazonBasics Universal Camera Bag to store my Panasonic ZS-3 P&S digital camera.<br /><br />The fit is not as snug as Lowepro Rezo 50 Camera Bag, but which one you want depends on your camera usage style. You open the the Amazon bag by pulling a Velcro-secured flap, whereas you pull one or two zippers on the Lowepro bag.<br /><br />I like the Amazon because of its looser fit for my camera and quicker access via a flap instead of zippers.<br /><br />The case is very well padded and it also has a zippered pocket for small items such as memory cards and spare batteries.<br /><br />And for less than four dollars, including free shipping if you have Amazon Prime membership, it is an amazing value.

0375413405|5.0|I only tried a few things out of this book, and all turned out to be delicious. My winter favorite is \\"Daube de Boeuf\\" on page 322. It takes a long time to marinate and to bake in the oven, but the amount of work involved is minimum (just standard chopping).  With a little bit planning, it makes a great weekend dinner. I cooked this stew many times, following the direction in the book. My family and friends absolutely love it!
0553805371|3.0|I really enjoyed A Briefer History of Time so I picked this up. While I enjoyed it I liked A Briefer History of Time much more. The Grand Design is very interesting when you can understand it. I realize the authors did their best to break down complex science to make it understandable but much went over my head. Of the parts I felt I understood I found it thought provoking. Based on all the science the authors leave no room, or need, for God. They deny that there are miracles because they would interrupt the laws of nature making the laws void. I would just contend that's why it's called a miracle and that's the proof of something/someone outside of nature interacting with nature. Near the end of the book they write, \\"But perhaps the true miracle is that abstract considerations of logic lead to a unique theory that predicts and describes a vast universe full of the amazing variety that we see.\\" They are willing to call it a miracle that we are close to a theory of the universe but deny that other miracles can occur. Pick this up if you're a Hawking fan but you'll be disappointed if you're hoping for another Briefer History of Time.

We have enjoyed the the stories about Peter rabbit and their friends along with the beautiful illustrations for many years. Now years later,  the books are still in great shape.  I recently bought another set as a Christmas gift for a kindergartener.
B00013F38K|5.0|I loved this as a kid and couldn't get enough!  nice presentation of cd box .  Amazon is reliable.
B0025KVLVA|5.0|If you can only have one Beatle CD this should be it. It's an outstanding full career collection based on combining the original Past Masters CDs released in the 80's.  Enjoy
B000FA5QZO|5.0|There seems to be a lot of headiness in the ism's this book comments on.  Vonnegut uses his talent to tell me, in a way that I can comprehend, about things I have a difficult time understanding.   This book is about war.  This book is about death.  One of my favorite passages describes the following: Darwin and war are both successful only with mounting corpses.     It was my first Vonnegut book and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B004LRZ2YC|5.0|I never saw (or even heard of) the original version of this story, but having seen this masterful remake I am speechless. I don't think it's much of a spoiler to say that this is a vampire movie, but more accurately, I think, I actually should say that this is a movie with a vampire in it. Believe me, you haven't seen a vamp movie like this, you can be sure.<br /><br />At its heart, the movie is about a relationship between a lonely young boy from a troubled home and a sad, lonely monster in the shape of a beautiful young girl. It is a testament to the brilliance of the original story and the production of this version that the movie can be dark and deeply disturbing while being touching and profound all at once. Make no mistake, there is plenty of blood, gore, and brutality, but it's the connection between the two kids, marvelously played by two fantastic young actors, that make this wonderful movie stand out. I can't say enough about the stellar performances of the two young leads, and about what is my favorite movie in a long time.
B004H8ZQKU|5.0|I have no clue what I just watched. That was by far one of the strangest, most interesting films I have ever seen.
0375842209|5.0|I checked this book out of the library at the suggestion of a friend.  I couldn't put it down and when I had finished it I knew that I had to own it so I bought it immediately.  It is an amazing story of the Nazis in Germany and how the Germans who did not support the Nazis were treated.  It is well-written and gripping.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins has really wrote a masterpiece here. Such an interesting and original idea, I could not put this book down!
B003EYVXXW|5.0|This film stays in your mind for a long time after watching it. You rethink the scenes, you rethink the plots, you just keep thinking about it, and finally you're forced to watch it again. Different, thought provoking.
B0049GYXDG|3.0|Much has been written on this film, some of the finest work done under Walt's direction. I'll restrict my comments to the blu-ray itself.     This picture quality is indeed superb and makes this blu-ray very much worthwhile.      Unfortunately, the advertised DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix must be proactively selected.  Unlike most Disney Classics Blu-rays, the default on Alice is stereo Dolby Digital.  That's a shame, because the lossless DTS-HD MA track is very well done and nicely balanced.  Given the importance of audio on the blu-ray format (and frankly, to Disney Animation), unless someone can provide a good reason for defaulting to lossy, stereo, Dolby Digital, i'm docking this otherwise beautiful transfer 2 stars.
B001437DMA|3.0|Sort of dissapointed with this one. Joe seemed board until the end of the CD. The last to songs are the best. His latest is way better! As of Dec 2012, This cd has grown on me. It's up to 4 good songs.
0470638842|5.0|What I love about Erik Qualman is that this book was so far ahead of the curve and he was taking about the stuff that we all take for granted now before people were even thinking about it. The book is heavy reading though and I'd suggest it for people who are in the industry or have a serious interest i social media but the good thing is that it is all still as relevant today as it was when published. We'll all look back at this book in 10 years time and think it was one of the defining books of the social media age.<br />Interesting little Debate between SEO and social media here as a taster..

0385341679|5.0|The series is just amazing! KMM is by far one of my favorite authors and she ended the Fever series brilliantly! If you haven't read them yet, definitely do!!
1400032717|2.0|Alas, I read the 52 or so pages of the excerpt with breathless excitement.  However, after buying the book, it began to be a real slog to read it, mainly because of all of the irrelevant \\"autistic atmosphere\\" that the author felt compelled to continue to blast out in giant clouds throughout the entire store.  I eventually realized that there was no story, and was a little sorry to see a book that started so promisingly spend its last fifty pages just choking out in the sand, like a river never reaching the sea.
B000001GY9|1.0|First of all, I like Bernstein. He was one of those that will never be replaced.     That said, these recordings are perhaps the worst recordings that I've ever heard on anything.     The tempos are bad, the orchestra sounds muffled, it is just horrible. I waited and waited for an exciting moment, for something that I could have told myself \\"ha, ha!\\" But not. It was disappointment after disappointment. There is really NOTHING on this recording that is worth listening.    I can't believe all these 5 stars...    As for a reference, my favorite Schumann's symphonies recordings are Karajan (one of the few Karajan's recordings that aged well) and Masur with the LPO.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|Having been alerted to this book by the Wall Street Journal essay (Why Chinese Mothers are Superior - Jan 8, 2011) and been amused by the brouhaha over it in the opinions that followed, I just had to get the story straight from the author. I'm glad I read the book! Amy Chua is first and foremost a very gifted writer. Her memoir about raising her girls is a pleasure to read and is refreshing in its emotional intensity and complete lack of pretense. Yes, this is cultural clash at its most extreme, but Amy has an interesting twist to the plot that seems to have been completely missed by the media storm surrounding her book.<br /><br />Amy's parenting rationale is based on a notion that with all the comforts of society available to her children, and without a social system demanding high performance, her daughters are at high risk for decline in achievement potential. Given that her entire family is high-achieving (including a sister with Down Syndrome who has won at the Special Olympics twice), you begin to see her dilemma. Amy's methods are derived from her upbringing and cultural values and are certainly debatable. However, it would be hard to argue that anyone aiming to compete on the world stage, whether in Sports, Sciences, or the Arts could get away with working less hard and even be considered!<br /><br />You do wonder, as you go through the book, whose dreams are being pursued here? I found myself going from being fascinated with Amy, to being completely repulsed by her, to finally understanding her as a parent. You can choose to give your children the luxury of figuring out for themselves what they want to do and let them take the initiative when they are ready - a Western model as Amy would call it. There is less pressure on the child while they seek a focus but you do run the risk of your son or daughter never deciding and thereby never actually becoming good at something. Alternatively, you can focus your kids very early in life on a significant challenge and give them a head-start at learning what it takes to really be a super achiever - the Chinese model in the author's view. The choice here is made by the parent as there is no time to lose on checking out various alternatives...and herein lies the risk...what if the child never warms up to what you selected?<br /><br />Amy walks a fine line trying to get her girls to swim upstream when the societal current naturally flows in the other direction and eventually learns the hard way that success is not guaranteed by her methods either. And yet, what she imparts to her children in the form of a dedication to sincere effort, appreciation for what it takes to succeed at a global level, and lack of a sense of entitlement is an asset that will likely reap future rewards.<br /><br />A timely book in my mind that should be taken seriously as parents in America try to figure out how to prepare the next generation for a world where being born in the U.S.A is less of a reason to feel secure about your future!ead-start at learning what it takes to really be a super achiever - the Chinese model in the author's view.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|I'll agree with most that installation is a bit tricky, but not super tough.  And yes you probably need to remover motherboard, my case (also from Cooler Master) has the opening on the other side that should prevent needing to remove MB, but no such luck, because the big nuts (haha) that attach to the backside of the MB went right up against that opening.  At first I thought silly Cooler Master, but I guess MB's could have different alignments.  Anyway, that aside this works great, easily gets 10degC cooler or more, and I'm only on one fan of the possible 2.  Probably better ones out there if you're looking for extreme performance but this is a superb value.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|there's a lot of weak complaints about this movie and this product in particular. i'll start with the material review, the blu-ray is priced great and you get a digital copy with it as well. Thats what makes it a special edition, if you're the kind of person that likes to watch hours of unreleased footage or commentary - its not that special. but i'm not one of those people, that stuff bores me. simply put, this blu-ray is priced like a DVD and you get a digital copy... stop crying.    the film: its well written and it pretty much has it all. great actors, brad pitt is hilarious in this movie. it has great action with gore and fighting. thats almost everything a man could ask for. the plot is inspiring - i mean who doesn't like watching nazis get scalped and burned alive? the only complaint i would entertain is that its not historically accurate. i get it. but i don't care about that. i like the way history was written in this movie more than the real life version.    that's it... if you like well written movies, especially ones about the military or war, with great acting and lots of gore and nazi killing, buy this right now. buy it now before the price goes up to what it should be.
B000E0LB7C|5.0|The hype around Beethoven didn't start yesterday. It is a product of the middle to late 19th century, when musician began to have an inkling of just how revolutionary (artistically speaking) Beethoven had been: how he changed the whole conception entertained by western civilisation of the nature of music. Remember that Hegel, an exact contemporary, still doubted that music was an autonomous art form!<br />The consequence was, that his Protean power. so persuasive and yet so uncomfortable for bourgeoise sensibilities, was subdivided. We know all about his three periods, and so on. Interpreters more or less followed suit: after all, they made a living out of him. When Schnabel, in Harold Schoenberg's headline, \\"invented\\" Beethoven, he created a caricature. He did not invent Beethoven, he drove the craze for originality to a quite unwholesome peak. I wonder how people could take this seriously, but they still do. The point I'm making here is that you are listening to Schnabel the pianist using Beethoven's music a a tightrope for his own dancing. No-one followed in him in this attitude; and just as well!<br />But he succeeded in obscuring the fact that Beethoven's true style was rather better represented, in his own era, by Wilhelm Backhaus. Many people always knew this; certainly the Decca people did. In consequence we have, in these recordings, a cycle of performances that are sane, stylistically secure, eschewing any exaggeration for mere effect and remaining unruffled by the cries of those who can't do without varnish and/or pretence. Stephen Kovacevich once said, \\"Wilhelm Backhaus was the only pianist who really understood Beethoven.\\" I can go along with that.<br />It is true that Backhaus is inclined to relatively fast tempi. Hi approach to the early sonatas will not suit every taste. But strangely, they reflect the \\"classical\\" nature of these works much better than, e.g. Kempff, who is often represented as playing them to perfection. I doubt it. There is an almost hectic nervousness to his playing that make you realise that he (Kempff) is doing the exact opposite: dressing the composer up as a barn-storming young eagle with neither the wit of Haydn nor the melancholy elegance of Mozart, but somewhere in between, between two stools. Of these \\"heart on the sleeve\\" moments of rhetoric, Backhaus once said, \\"well, it can't have been all that much in deadly earnest!\\" Of course not: it was all play with forms that Beethoven would eventually break up, when he became Beethoven. So Backhaus is true to the metier, whereas others err in believing that they have to play as if Beethoven had foresight that he would one day compose a Waldstein Sonata (e.g. Arrau).<br />Backhaus is at his best in the mature sonatas. Let me make just one point, which is so important that we nearly always forget it. Any performer who plays just the notes, properly and with full attention on the markings and a genuine knowledge of how the composer's style fits into his own environment, can't go wrong. But I have just announced the hardest interpretive task of all. When you hear Backhaus play the Waldstein or Appassionata, you become aware that he adds nothing of his own to the notes: and now the miracle is, that the works are all the more eloquent for it. For once you actually hear the voice of the creator, not that of his interpreter! - I have always felt that the late sonatas, so tempting to pianists to overplay them, are majestic in Backhaus' rendering, especially opp. 106 and 111.<br />The recording quality varies a lot, from somewhat poor and dull to clear and translucent. Recording techniques changed over the more than 10 years of the making. The Hammerklavier was evidently recorded first; it is still in mono. Nonetheless, in terms of Beethoven playing, Backhaus has few rivals on his own level of greatness. Among younger players, only Gilels and Pollini reach a similar kind of consistency. Both those cycles are incomplete, and much as this must irk admirers of Pollini, he was better at it in his younger years. I for one am not keen to hear any more of his Beethoven after auditioning his two latest albums. Gilels is on the whole the best modern version, although he has a few quite eccentric moments (No. 13, No. 31). In short: as far as complete cycles are concerned, and assuming you are serious about Beethoven and not just sold on comparing the gimmicks of Mr X and Y, the Backhaus set is an investment for life.as better at it in his younger years.

B000HIVIOW|5.0|This is a classic in our Family. My son enjoyed this when he was two...and family and friends have loved this when given as a gift. The story is slightly different from the award winning book of which this video is an adaption... in this video...and extra section shows a party at the North Pole...LOVE the music. Good lesson in that snow men don't last, no two are the same...and that circumstances between a man made of snow and a little boy are different. Highly recommend this wonderful video that adults will enjoy and small children will watch over and over again.
B004LRVFX4|4.0|Didn't expect much from this movie based on the title and preview.  I was pleasantly surprised.  This move was engaging.  I would recommend this to anyone who is tired of the same old vampire movie.
B000UGG39Q|2.0|Very Sabbath sounding, some really good riffs, Phils voice sounds good with no aggression for a little bit but eventually your like bring out the balls brother. He CANT anymore, thats what made Down was phil's aggression along with Peppers killer riffs. Phil blew out his voice, to much herion and drinking i would imagine. So this is pretty much the worst that Down has done lyrically. Decent music, horrible production though as well. My daughter screams better than Phil does now. :( Course he is now almost 43.
B002JWD6AS|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It was a quick read and easy on the eyes. Was classified as a young adult/teen read, but I still thought it was pretty good.  There were a few parts in the book that made me think \\"oh yeah right, whatever\\", but I just had to remind myself that this was classified as \\"young adult\\".  I already downloaded the 2nd book, Linger and will start it tonight.
0393932192|4.0|The product took a fairly long time to get to me, however when it did i was pleased with the decent condition that it was in.
B001PU8N0I|3.0|The series is fine, but the BBC makes you watch long, un-fast-forwardable trailers each time you view -- annoying, as we have already paid for this.
0374158460|5.0|This is the best new book I have read in years.  It reminds me of classic Faulkner, in the way in which he would chronicle the the rise and fall of a family.  Epically beautiful and TRUE.  The nuance and subtleties he paints into the various characters and situations are breathtaking.  I absolutely agree with some reviewer's sentiment that the nonbelievers just don't \\"get it\\".   I know one of the negative reviews pointed out that Patty's autobiography was told in the third person, as if Mr. Franzen didn't know any better!  Come on.   Really?  That's what makes it all the more brilliant!!  It's almost as if she doesn't want to acknowledge some of her actions were of her own will.  I ask you to consider her encounter with Richard where she claims to be \\"sleepwalking\\".  Therefore (in her mind) she's not responsible for her actions.  No wonder she considers herself \\"the autobiographer\\".     Granted.  There are brief moments that could have fallen on the editing room floor. It is a tad on the longish side, but I never wanted it to end and always wondered where we were going next.  Also, as far as the politics of the book go, I honestly never felt that Mr. Franzen was preaching.  He seemed to do a great job portraying the arguments of both the reds and the blues.  I don't feel as if I was left with any political message- except some interesting comments on overpopulation and the murderous nature of domestic cats ;)     Regardless, I think that's why people give this one star.  They just don't \\"get it\\".  Absolutely brilliant.  I'll be thinking about this one for weeks.  It has renewed my faith in contemporary literature!
B004LRZ2YC|1.0|I'm writing this under my wife's account, so this review is not from her.    I recently had the living hell scared out of me after watching Case 39. I was thinking this movie might rival that one, but boy was I wrong. I'm not even sure when I was supposed to be scared during this movie. Very, very weak. More of a love story than a horror movie.    I don't even like scary movies, so I know a scary movie when I see one. I really wish this had been the 99 cent movie, because we definitely just threw away $3.99!!!

B004HWYTP4|4.0|(No spoilers)    We enjoyed it, loved the cast - we found the movie quirky and humorous, different from anything else we've ever seen, held our interest, and we had a good time watching it.  Some things were predictable and some so off-the-wall no one could predict.      I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a different type of movie, it doesn't quite fall into any one category like action, adventure, fantasy, or romantic comedy, but is a little bit of all the above.  Yes, we'd watch it again.  It was great getting to see John Malkovich again after recently viewing Secretariat...we LOVED the pig!  John is always such an intriguing actor.  It was lovely to see Mary-Louise Parker whom I haven't seen since Fried Green Tomatoes, well played here as well, and she doesn't look like she's aged a bit!      I'm glad this title came up in the most viewed VODs, thanks Amazon & fellow viewers.  :)

B002ZG99TA|1.0|This is quite honestly the worst film I have ever seen.

B004289ZW0|4.0|Works very well as advertised with the iPad, running the aviation program ForeFlight or Motion X GPS.  Very easy to install and use, and battery life is very good.  I would rate it 5 stars but for the On/Off touch-slide switch.  This seems to be techno-geek overkill.  I agree with another reviewer that a simple, mechanical on/off switch would be better - more reliable and much less aggravating.  The touch-slide switch on the product is extremely sensitive for turning the unit ON (often unintentionally), but very much less sensitive for turning it OFF, probably by design. Despite others' complaints that the switch \\"quit working\\", I have not (yet) had that problem.  I have always been able to turn the unit off, but it often takes a little patience and and a few swipes (usually only 2 or 3) to do so.  Note that there is a reset orifice that can be used to turn it off manually, as the manual describes, but I have not had to use it.    Nevertheless, I highly recommend this product for its ease of installation with the iPad, its overall simplicity and performance, and fairly low cost.  With this GPS unit, my non-3G iPad and ForeFlight's charts, my flight bag just got a whole lot lighter, and my wallet a little heavier.
B00021HBGS|5.0|these are good quality, bright colors and good material. they look just like the picture. a lot lighter weight than i imagined, which is great since they only stick to the tub walls with water. i will definitely be buying these again for future gifts as well as for my infant daughter.
0525423273|5.0|I tend to gravitate more towards urban fantasy books...but now and then, I throw those aside for something a bit more real. After reading all the positive raves about Anna and the French Kiss, I decided to give this book a try. Boy am I glad I did! First of all, as someone who has traveled to Paris more times than I can count for business (and once in a while for pleasure) and who told her husband four years ago that she was sick of the place, this book reminded me of all the wonderful things I've forgotten about the city of lights. Secondly, this book managed to do what so many other YA have tried but failed at (at least for me): remind me of what it felt like to be a teen on her own without the parental units and the glorious highs and horrid lows of first \\"real\\" love.<br /><br />Anna is a fantastic, all-too-human character who I think will appeal to most women out there. She manages to overcome her self-imposed limitations, gain some much needed maturity, and score a delightfully awesome dude in the process. As for said dude, well...I dare you not to fall in love with him yourself. Move over Edward...Etienne is just wonderful, flaws and all. But Anna and the French Kiss isn't just a book about finding yourself and true love when you least expected it; it also explores the meaning of friendship between young women and what it means to be loyal, forgiving, and kind to those you call friends. So many YA books give the barest lip service to the relationship between the heroine and other girls and instead focus on the boy/girl love angle. But this one dares to explore the complexities of friendship between women and how things don't always go smoothly even between the closest friends.<br /><br />Anyway, if you're looking for something fun yet with a streak of depth not always found in other similar books...pick this one up. C'est magnifique!
1439107955|4.0|I was asked if there was a \\"book\\" for cancer. If there was not, there is now. Mukherjee's \\"The Emperor of all Maladies: A Biography of Cancer\\" is a ambitious and successful book for which there is not yet a clear ending.    Mukherjee is an oncologist and the book does not oversimplify the complexity of cancer. His biography of the cancer focuses on the disease and the people swirling around its vortex. As such, much of the book is filled with scientific language and discussions of experiments and theories. While some of it may be over some readers' heads (and some of it was certainly over mine), Mukherjee always manages to put the discussion into context.    As the father of a child with cancer I'm more familiar than I want to be with many of the terms. It was also surprising to see how much treatment occurring today was still being debated in this decade. The story of cancer is long, it is contentious, and it is depressing. But just when you want to give up, another step is made toward battling some type of cancer.    One clear lesson is that there will not be a \\"magic bullet\\" to solve cancer, because cancer is really many diseases. Some types of cancer have seen progress which may be seen as a cure, but really are simply methods to avoid death. The cancer does not go away, but death is held at bay. For other types of cancer there is slow progress marked by ups and downs as new treatments breed new issues, but other treatments show up in the least expected places.    Mukherjee, while clearly respectful of all the people who have made progress in battling cancer, does not glorify his medical profession. He laments the split between researchers and clinicians, the battle of egos which have kept some collaborations apart, the lack of funding from a variety of sources, and the inability of some doctors to understand their patients. However, he avoids the easy target of telling everyone why they are wrong. He shows the scientists in their context, shows how they advancethe cause, and celebrates when boundaries are overcome and new hope is created.     And how do you end a biography on a living entity? Mukherjee points toward the future of research and where he sees the next strides in overcoming cancer coming from. He notes the progress that has been made and argues against those who say no real progress is being made. You can play with statistics, but when more people live, live longer, and live healthier lives, the statistics no longer matter.    This should become a textbook not only for future medical professionals, but philosophers and historians of science as well. And all affected by cancer (and that is nearly everybody) will find that their journey, while unique, is not new. And it is not without hope.
0307454541|4.0|I bought this as one of my first purchases for my new Kindle. I doubt I would have bought this had it not been for all the hype and fuss the series has received. I must concur with many of the previous reviewers in that you do have to muster through the first couple of chapters before you really begin to enjoy the story but then the payoff becomes worth it...the book (or Kindle!) essentially becomes impossible to put down!<br /><br />I won't bother explaining the story as it's been done many times already. I'd like to add that I was very satisfied with the translation and also that I learned some new things about a different country and it's culture as the story is based in Sweden.<br /><br />I enjoyed this so much I've already bought the 2 sequels. As I just finished 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' I stopped here to deliver this review while I looked up which book is the next in the series (turns out it's 'The Girl Who Played With Fire') and now I'm off to start my next literary adventure!
B002JH3TW8|1.0|This item simply did not work.  I troublshooted the problem for quite some time to make sure it wasn't the hub or the firewire cable or the port on the computer.

It's not worth it to pay shipping to return it so I just ate the cost... oh well.
0307454541|3.0|Stieg Larsson's \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is a frenzied, heckled distillation of his personal experiences and pet issues:  the corporate dominance over the media, the abuse of women in society, the rape of the powerless by the powerful, the destruction of a manufacturing economy by financial speculators.  The immediacy and relevance of these issues to today's society have helped propelled this novel onto the top of international bestseller lists.  But the sad truth is that this book, no matter how much we admire its social polemic, just isn't very entertaining.<br /><br />It isn't entertaining because the writing is too verbose and shallow, the plot too long and convoluted, the pacing slow and lame.  It's a decent first draft -- which I think was the intention of this book -- but it needed a lot more work.  It's a book that's meant to shock, but because television is too shocking nowadays anyway it doesn't really shock anymore.  It doesn't shock also because the villains just feel too inane and inept to scare -- they're more pitiful victims than malicious masterminds.
B0047WJ12K|3.0|The concept of the film was very interesting.  I would even say that several elements of the film were interesting.  The great shocking moment at the end of the moment was almost a relief, rather than revelation. I don't think the movie lives up to the hype.<br /><br />Entertaining, excellent acting, but other aspects seemed to just go on and on dragging things out.  There are several areas where you just feel like you don't know what's going on.

This book is set up with lessons and is designed for a classroom environment, but I use it solo and it still is pretty good.

B003UESJH4|5.0|As a history buff, I wanted to see this even though I was expecting to feel let down.  Many times the films are not true to the facts.  But this was wonderful.  Much of historical accounts give the impression that it was Elizabeth (Bowes-Lyons) who helped Bertie improve so in this case the movie was truer than the biographies.  I will probably buy the dvd on this one.  This is Colin Firths best since Pride and Prejudice (I have that dvd set as well).  The only thing wrong with this was it ended short.  As long as they were alive it should have continued.

B002GZQYMK|5.0|As I sat playing in a casino a few weeks ago, I heard over the speakers the song \\"Uprising\\". It caught my attention immediately and I stopped and listened--jotted down a few lines of the lyrics that I could make out and was determined to find out just who was that!?  A few googling later, I find this band. I agree with everyone that they sound like Queen (with F. Mercury) and U2--both bands I like. I was only going to download the track I had heard, but when I saw the price (1/2 price) I thought I would just buy the whole CD. Absolutely not disappointed with this album--definitely beats the garbage that mainstream music has become! And this purchase was initiated from a trip to a casino--imagine that!!!!
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I have really stepped up my running since getting a Garmin 405CX.  My distance and pace have been steadily improving and I love having the data on the computer to review my run.  The wireless downloading works wonderfully, I just have to walk in the house and my Garmin is talking to my computer.  The touch bezel is not always the easiest to operate, but I have problems operating iPod touches and my daughter's quickfire touch phones too.  So I think its partially my ineptness with touch devices.  But I have a training display set up that I like, and I tend to leave it on that throughout my run. I don't have a steady running partner, so the Garmin has taken that place.  It's totally addictive, and I can't imagine running without it now.  My aerobics instructor, who told me about Garmins, is an incredible runner and she feels the same.  I'm a small woman with a very small wrist, and the 405CX fits me better than some of the other models I borrowed before purchase.  I'm very pleased with it!
B000V86OKG|5.0|This is one of the great seasons of a great show.  Dexter is back again and his homicidal work has been discovered under the sea.  Dexter shows that he isn't just a Dark Passenger who kills the wicked, he is willing to set up an unpopular co-worker with little conscience and pin the murders on him.  A good show that doesn't muddle over the fact that killing is killing and the protagonist might not be the good guy but a semblance of a good guy.  Lots of issues to think about and discuss while enjoying a really great show too.

B004BJMEO6|5.0|I love this movie Elena Undone. It captures the emotion of our lives, that we can find true love in a place we least expected. I believe in soul mate. That special someone knows you from inside and out. I have watched Nicole Conn 'Clair Of The Moon' when I was young, though did not know she has written and directed the movie, been a huge fan ever since. Her new film has top my lesbian movie of all time. She has captured the essence of love, heartache and the struggle we go through to find our self. That we can let go the tradition we were brought up to learn, and let true love find away. I will enjoy this movie for the rest of my years. Thank you Nicole, for bringing your experience of your life and put it on the screen.
0061992860|4.0|Ok, I received my SAS guide, but I'm not sure what's in it. Reason? I'm older, therefore, my eyes can't quite see what's on the pages.  The book is SO small (must have been designed for a 'little person's' backpack) and the print so small that I will have to carry a magnifying glass with me just to make use of the info.  That's probably not going to be too convenient in an emergency situation. Overall, It's probably very content-rich, I just can't SEE IT!
1439107955|3.0|The most poignant part of this book for me was when Mukherjee recalls a report in which the author of the report discusses how major diseases in human history have been wiped out through prevention, not through treatment - polio and small pox are examples. Mukherjee seems to understand the importance of this principle and yet spends the whole book discussing anything BUT Cancer prevention.  Besides a lengthy discussion of the impact of cigarette smoking on lung Cancer, little thought is given to Cancer's myriad other causes.  Yes, Cancer is a disease of genetic mutations, but what causes them to mutate?  Brief mention is given to radiation, pesticides and hormone therapy, and even less to plastics.  Are we really that far from understanding how our bodies are impacted by how we live, breathe, and eat? Or is Mukherjee only able to view Cancer from the perspective of Oncologist, one whose tools are chemicals. In Mukherjee's view of 2050, we are still chasing Cancer with drugs that become resistant and are followed by more drugs and so on.  I learned much in reading this book, but mostly found it to be a history lesson.  I found little insight into the future and even less hope in the medical establishment.

B004A7OQKY|5.0|I do this video five to six days a week. This has been the best video for me to stay in shape and prepare me for labor. I wish I would of had this for my previous two pregnancies.  Some of the exercises are harder if you are not used to working out (triceps on the chair), but I have much more energy by doing this forty minute workout.  I know the lighting is a little weird at times but the actual workout is what I look at and I don't have it very loud so the music on it doesn't bother me.  I have not done the partner workout so I cannot comment on that part of the workout. I would highly recommend this video to any pregnant woman who wants to stay in shape while being pregnant. Remember, this is an actual workout. It is not one of the pregnancy videos that just works on some yoga and breathing. It is intended to workout different parts of your body including your glutes, hamstrings, arms, back, balancing, and quads.

B004DK5CYM|3.0|This benign and somewhat stodgy 2010 Disney production is aimed squarely at the same audience who cheered at the against-all-odds dramaturgy of [[ASIN:B002VECM6S The Blind Side]]. To his credit, director Randall Wallace ([[ASIN:B000068TPN We Were Soldiers]]) manages to build galloping momentum in telling the familiar story of Secretariat, the legendary chestnut Thoroughbred who won the Triple Crown in 1973, even though the ending is a given. The movie is strangely bipolar. On the track, there is a palpable sense of urgency in the way Dean Semler's high-definition camera captures the spirit of the races, complemented by the Edwin Hawkins Singers' 1969 rendition of \\"Oh Happy Day\\". Dressed in his blue-and-white blinker hood, the racehorse shows the majestic prowess that combined speed and stamina to allow him to bolt from dead last to the finish line. The movie pushes hard to make the races evoke religious inspiration.<br /><br />Off the track, it tries for the same effect but falls short because screenwriter Mike Rich sticks close to formula in telling the story of Penny Chenery, a Denver housewife who unexpectedly took over her ailing father's Virginia stable after her mother's death. Knowing nothing about raising horses, she wins Secretariat in a coin toss and instinctively knows through the horse's bloodlines that she has a winner on her hands. Not afraid to fire a corrupt trainer, she recruits the eccentric Lucien Laurin to push Secretariat to his full potential. The script elevates Chenery to a benevolent figure whose dedication is portrayed as noble and pure. That she willingly leaves her family for long stretches of time barely generates any honest conflict at home. In turn, there is little depth to any of the characters in spite of a stellar cast of actors who are capable of doing more than they are allowed here.<br /><br />A far cry from the guilt-ridden adulteress she played in [[ASIN:B00006RCNY Unfaithful]], Diane Lane effectively plays Penny with steely resolve under the constraints of her real-life character's well-moneyed, genteel manner and a Pat Nixon-style blonde wig. As the comically eccentric Laurin, John Malkovich has a field day wearing bad hats and screaming French profanity. The rest of the cast play their stock characters with aplomb - Margo Martindale as devoted secretary Miss Ham, Dylan Walsh as Penny's testy husband, James Cromwell as a powerful breeder, singer/musician Amanda Michalka as Penny's hippie daughter, and Nelsan Ellis as the deferential groom. Scott Glenn is wasted in the role of Penny's catatonic father. This is wholesome traditional fare that does its job in injecting fervor to the racetrack scenes and predictability to the inspiring backstory of the world's greatest racehorse.<br /><br />The 2011 DVD adds three excisable deleted scenes; a 15-minute featurette (\\"Heart of a Champion\\") that focuses on the horse, not the movie; a four-minute video of the ending credits song, Michalka's \\"It's Who You Are\\"; and two shorts focusing on the joys of Blu-Ray. The 2011 Blu-Ray adds a dry audio commentary track from Wallace; a standard six-minute making-of featurette (\\"Choreographing the Races\\"); a 21-minute conversation with the real Penny Chenery, now a feisty 88; a unique feature that allows four historical perspectives - a jockey's, a sports reporter's, a historian's, and a spectator's - on Secretariat's performance in the 1973 Preakness Stakes through a CGI simulation; and four more deleted scenes.constraints of her real-life character's well-moneyed, genteel manner and a Pat Nixon-style blonde wig.

B000SCHBGQ|1.0|I was hoping for a light, fun ride into a new fantasy world.  This silly novel fails miserably.  The twins at the center of the story are vapid.  They're also a little creepy with all that hand-holding and finger squeezing.  The Immortal Nicholas Flammel is in way over his head and inspires no confidence.  Gandalf and Dumbledore he ain't.  The villains are pure camp; all they're missing is a furry white cat.  Oops, nevermind, there are cats.  And birds.  (Hitchcock is rolling over in his grave.)  Scott's noxious brew of every myth and legend he could Google feels like the kitchen sink has been thrown into this mess.  And his prose is childish and repetitive.  Yes, we know Josh and Sophie are twins.  There's no need to remind us every 3rd sentence.  We also know their last name is Newman.  Is it really necessary to call them by their full name for the first 20 chapters?  Yes, we know their parents are archeologists.  Stop saying it over and over again.  And yes, we know Dr. John Dee (always John Dee and always impeccably dressed) is a Doctor.  It registered the first 125 times it was mentioned.  And that part about Josh and Sophie saving up to buy a car - we remembered it from the last time it was mentioned half a page ago.  I could go on and on and on.  This book is pure drivel for anyone over over the age of 6.  I want a refund.
B003B96AOW|5.0|This Deadpool is easily the best accessorized figure to come out of the Marvel Select line.  Green Goblin had some goodies worth noting too but Wade Wilson has him cold.  The side holstered pistols are beautifully made and work flawlessly, the twin swords are spectacular and his rifle is pretty mean looking as well.  The sai he's holding are a little large and lack a holder of any kind... a clip in the back of his belt would have been a good spot to store them when not being held but overall, pretty minor complaints.<br /><br />This is the best looking Deadpool I've seen yet and one of the best looking in the Select line.  Highly recommended!
B0034G4OZO|5.0|I got some laughs and decent feedback from customers as IKOAFS screened this week but the Blu quality is what most people were noticing on the display. Universal put together one of their normally packed BDs with solid specs to back it up.<br /><br />I did not watch this to be a documentary or fair representation of the institutional psychiatric field, so I got some fair entertainment and time well-spent out of this (lots of complaining out there). The picture quality is outstanding with all of the shortcomings of certain faces shining through a bit too much. The art-imposed-on-the-screen montages came through a little bit better than the big screen, with that sunset on top of the hospital scene looking deliberately fake (in other words the special effects are not BD worthy but they still looked fine). The DTS really only gets tested in the concert scene and the music piece at the end, actually any of those dream/neo-reality/art sequences use the outer channels some. The special features:<br /><br />* Deleted scenes, 8:45 minutes. Lengthy at times with only a couple of Galifianakis clips having hit the floor. Really worthy for the Gilchrist fans.<br />* Outtakes, 11:28 minutes. Also feels lengthy but a few of the expected ZG jokes and ad-libs make it worth your while. They bleeped out the foul language - lame.<br />* A Look Inside, 3:11 minutes. A clip heavy ad-plug piece with some talking heads gushing storyline and support, skipper.<br />* Premiere at NYC, 2:30 minutes. Some red carpet interviews centering on ZGs talent and Ryan Fleck giving some quick background.<br />* pocket BLU app with the iPad enhancement now. Found nothing new on the BD live section.<br /><br />A worthy renter for those wanting a decent character coming-of-age piece, and maybe a buyer for fans of ZG looking to see him deliver a talented dark performance. 3.5 for the film, 1.5 for the BD specs and features.

B001OQCV2E|3.0|The movie had GOOD special effects but my overall rating of the actual storyline, I'd say it was just OK for me.  I feel that I could've enjoyed it more if it was a bit \\"shorter\\" in running-time.  It did not really meet my \\"expectations\\" to see a \\"chain-series\\" of disasters & events in different parts of the world that would lead to \\"THE END OF THE WORLD.\\"      I was expecting to see an \\"earthquake\\" in some part of the world and a \\"HURRICANE\\" in another and a \\"TSUNAMI\\" in another and \\"FIRE\\" in another...but for a single \\"whole-world-is-crumbling to pieces\\" universal event, the movie was way too long for my own comfort! It seems to me the makers purposely and unnecessarily stretched a good movie, killing the \\"spunk\\" of the actual storyline (and my captivated-interest) by doing so.      By the tail-end of the movie, I was very ANTSY for it to FINISH already.
0618526412|3.0|I recently saw the flim, a second time on TCM, after seeing it when the film came out.  I subsequently purchased the book on Kindle, and would have to say once again, the book is much better than the film.  For me, the film was about people not listning, exemplified by the mute character of Singer.  The relationship of the Black doctor, his family and his torments are more complicated. The film is trite compared to the reality brought out by McCullers.   The knife fight in the brothel is a raw but all too common of black anger against other blacks. The book, like the film is not something to read on the beach. The anger that Dr. Copeland is a strikingly complex character. Surving the hardship of being black and poor, he becomes a doctor. Not only does he hate white people, he doesn't have a relationship with his family which he tries to elevate to his idea of improving their lot of being black. In frustration, he strikes his wife who leaves him, along with his children. Only Portia, his daughter, a maid in the small southern town visits her father occasionally.  The black doctor, lives by himself and and finds a common sprit in the white deaf mute.  The irony only adds to the pain of striving to care for his people and his growing affliction with pneumonia.    Mick, the tall, skinny daughter of a handicapped father, becomes drawn into the world of the mute, Mr. Singer.His relationship with the only other mute in town is a difficult and tragedy.  The result is a strange assortment of lonely people, bound together not by family relationships, race, age or education.  Their only bond is their poverty and search for a meaning to their lives.  Mr Singer is the glue that holds them together.  Like Carson McCullers other book, Member of the Wedding, this novel reaches deep into the hearts of its characters and places them in an odd caldron of life, hard, cruel and at times with the greatest of love for other suffering humans.

B004BLJQOK|5.0|I checked this out because I'm a fan of Chloe Moretz. and as usual, she steals the movie. She is such a fantastic actress, and has a bright career a head of her.<br /><br />The story is of a boy, Owen, who pretty much lives a sheltered life. His mom is a religious person, who has a drinking problem, and thinks she controls Owen's life, but pretty much ignores him.  At school, he's a target of bullies and doesn't really have any friends. The one day, a mysterious girl, Abby, moves in the same apartment complex (right next door) as him and Owen just sees her at night.  Abby has secrets that she wanted to keep to herself. As the story unfolds, Abby tells Owen her secrets and pretty much Owen finds out that Abby is a vampire.  The two are friends, and Abby tells Owen that he has to stand up to the bullies. Abby and Owen have a wonderful friendship.  That's all I really want to say about the plot. I've left some things out, but I want the viewer to discover the secrets for themselves.<br /><br />The boy who plays Owen does a nice job. We can't help but to feel sorry for him when the bullies torment him. I do have to say that when the bullies were tormenting Owen, that was kind of hard to watch.  Owen is a bit creepy at times, but that just adds to his character.<br /><br />Chole Moretz plays Abby, and as usual, she steals whatever movie she is in. Moretz plays Abby perfectly.  Abby is dark and gritty, and keeps her secrets. As the story unfolds, we can't help but to feel all of the emotions that Abby is feeling. I can't say enough good things about Moretz acting skills. She's a natural talent who has a fantastic and bright acting career in front of her.<br /><br />It's been said that this is a horror movie.....yes and no. It's violent, really violent at times, but I'm not really willing to call it a horror movie. Let's call it a very, very violent drama movie.  It's a story of friendship. The writing, acting, and camera angles as perfect.  This was such a great movie to see, I do plan on getting it.<br /><br />I highly suggest this movie. At least watch it for Chole Moretz, you won't be sorry.I highly suggest this movie. At least watch it for Chole Moretz, you won't be sorry.
B003FSTN7A|5.0|This was a good season and I had no problems with the dvd's that I saw either.<br />I think that this was a strong season and it didn't really have a bad episode , in fact it was business as usual and most fans agreed with my view. I think the show was always willing to do interesting things and the fact that the kids were featured more helped out this show. It will be missed, although the last season had  a deranged ending for sure! ( depicting  a living person die in a tv show is taking \\"based on  the life of\\" to strange levels indeed! )  but that series hasn't been out on dvd yet. I would say that this was probably my favorite season of the whole series! The dvd's are acceptable too.
B0012GN2I8|5.0|I really like this recording and I honestly do not know why it touches me so deeply. There are a lot of jazz funk recordings out there, but this is the one I like listening to all of the time. Herbie Hancock is a genius. I regularly enjoy listening to recordings of Charlie Parker, Horace Silver, the Modern Jazz Quartet, the Heath Brothers, Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers, Art Pepper, Zoot Sims and other bebop and hard bop artists. I also enjoy listening to Chopin, Beethoven and Mozart regularly. This super funky album firmly established electronic music in what once was an acoustically dominated art. This funky jazz album gave us a peek at what was to come and which is here now. Electronic everything: from cars to phones and everything in between. This to me is the signal jazz album of the Electronic Age. Herbie Hancock's Headhunter album was an experiment and major breakthrough that won many awards. The \\"Secrets\\" album to me is the final product and culmination of a sound that will be listened to for a long time. Thank you Amazon.com for providing a marketplace for these hard to find recordings.     Warm regards and Aloha,    D. A. Rofoli  Kenai, Alaska

Finding a quality DVD for the movie hasn't been easy either. When I found the this version of The Goonies, I was stoked! I couldn't wait to get it into my hands. I put the DVD in the Blu-Ray player and fell in love with the movie all over again. I've watched the butchered TV version so many times, I forgot some of of the best parts!    Since it is a Blu-Ray disc the quality of the picture is amazing. The bonus features are good too. All in all, I think this is a must have for you collection if you are a fan. Two thumbs up!

B003G93ZCM|4.0|It is hard not to have some respect for Eugene Cernan. He is a veteran of three spaceflights, Gemini 9, Apollo 10, and Apollo 17. He commanded the Apollo 17 mission to the moon which was tremendously successful and brought back more science than any Moon landing before it. Even today, despite the fact that Apollo 17 was flown in December 1972, he still holds the title \\"last man to walk on the Moon.\\"    He starts out describing his story from his childhood and how he became inspired to fly planes. He eventually enlisted in the Navy and became a naval aviator. NASA decided to call him up when they set out to recruit some new astronauts.    Tragedy would strike Cernan during the Gemini program. He was on the backup crew for Gemini 9 when the prime crew, Elliot See and Charles Bassett, was killed in a plane crash a few months before launch. Gene had his chance for his first trip into space.    Gemini 9 ended up being a mixed bundle for Cernan and his crewmate Tom Stafford. The docking target that was launched for them never deployed properly. And then came Cernan's spacewalk. He describes in detail what happened during it. It can all be summed up in the chapter's title \\"The Spacewalk from Hell.\\" Despite things that went wrong, NASA considered Gemini 9 a success. Lessons were learned and the program moved on.    Cernan continued training for one of the early Apollo flights. Tragedy would strike again when the Apollo 1 fire killed astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee. It was an event that hit Cernan hard.    He was eventually assigned as a backup crew member of Apollo 7 which put him in rotation to be the LM pilot of Apollo 10. Cernan describes the mission to the moon. A full dress rehearsal for Apollo 11, the final check of the entire Apollo system. It includes the harrowing, if only a few seconds long, mistake when the LM spun out of control while away from the CSM.    Cernan returns to Earth to prepare for the big one. Command of his own mission and thechance to walk on the Moon. He was able to play his cards right. With the last few Apollo missions being canceled, some questioned whether or not there would be an Apollo 17. But his gamble paid off. Although he lost Joe Engle to scientist-astronaut Jack Schmitt, walking on the Moon during Apollo 17 was the achievement of the century for him.    After Apollo 17, the book is pretty much over. He talks a little bit about his divorce and the philosophical reflections of his experiences.    As I said in the title, I felt the book was not perfect. Throughout parts of this book, Cernan unabashedly shows off his large ego. There was a kind of \\"I'm a hot shot test pilot/astronaut and engineers/scientists/doctors/etc. don't know anything\\" thing going on. In his defense, he does say that Jack Schmitt was a very able astronaut, despite not being a pilot, and putting him on Apollo 17 was probably the right decision.    Also, for being called \\"The Last Man on the Moon,\\" I expected more about Apollo 17 itself. Instead the entire Lunar stay only takes up one chapter in the book. So much more could have been said. His descriptions of his spaceflight experience are great, but the last one was a bit lacking.    In conclusion, I definitely recommend this book. Gene Cernan is only one of twelve people to have ever experienced what it was like to walk on the Moon and his own views on it are invaluable. Although some parts of the book are not perfect, he certainly makes up for it in others.    As a postscript, the Kindle edition does have a few formatting problems. Unnecessary hyphens, incorrect numbers and letters at random places, and the like. Not a big problem, though.
1595141715|4.0|This book had me on the edge of my seat wanting to know how all the people were connected to her death. At the end, after finding out how all were connected, it was just amazing. This book was truly worth the read. It only goes to show that what one does/says have an impact on other whether you are aware of it or not.
0517548232|5.0|Add this book to the short list of essential reading for the average person seeking a self-education in basic economics.  The genius of the book is that the author is able to explain complex economic concepts in a way that is easily obtainable to the average person.  This is genius because so many economics writers use jargon and academic-speak in ways that confuse more than inform.  The basic principle the author tries to teach is that one must consider all the potential effects, short-term and long-term, among all groups rather than merely the short-term effects on one special group.  Highly recommended for all, especially those looking for a good start in basic economics.
B0043ISH6O|3.0|I agree with some of the views shared in some of the so-called \\"negative \\"reviews: the music here is not \\"original\\" in any sense of the word (and yes, I think Daft Punk's score on [[ASIN:B0037KMHRY Tron Legacy]] is a lot better).<br /><br />Still, the music here is interesting. I listened to it while filling out paperwork and it helped me pass the time. The music is subtle, strange, electronic, etc., but again, as my title suggests, the music is good, but not great.<br /><br />(Keep in mind, my friends: I am BIASED for these reasons: 1) I'm not really a fan of either Trent Reznor or Atticus Ross and 2) [[ASIN:B0034G4P7Q The Social Network (Two-Disc Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray]]] wasn't the best film of 2010 in my opinion.)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|These books completely drew me into their world in a way that no other series has, Lord of the Rings, Twilight, Harry Potter, non. They are absolutely enthralling, and left me speechless. The author takes her audience through the twists and turns of her characters, characters realistically and beautifully created, and brings the world of Panem alive.
B003R50AW8|4.0|This enchanting story of the value to be found in a nobody lacks some of the charm of the author's \\"Book Thief\\" but is just a quirky and much more closely related to this reader's world.  The central character is a better person than he gives himself credit for, yet this story escapes the unreality of an Oprah book club 'accentuate the positive' volume and delves into an everyday world of ordinary folk with not much money and not many opportunities.  For Australians it is particularly real.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I purchased this as a christmas gift for my son.  The plastic swivels for the ear piece are not heavily constructed and are made of cheap plastic, however, if you are careful with it and are aware of it, you should be alright.  They replaced the one we broke with no hassels and my son uses it all the time and absolutely loves it.  He can talk to his friends while playing games with them on-line and loves it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book did not disappoint.  Kept me guessing until the very end.  Haymitch and Finnick are great characters.  I do not want to give anything away, but there is some really interesting twist to the Hunger Games in this book.  Another great book suitable for young adult and with enough substance to attract readers of all ages.  I love dystopian fantasies and this one fits the bill.  Loved it!  Now on to Mockingjay!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003VD1G56 NetherWorld]]
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Wow, this book was impressive. It was an awesome ending to an excellent series. I was riveted from page 1. As soon as I started reading it that is all that I wanted to do. There are so many revelations and twists in this book that it was almost hard to keep up with. Things would be revealed in one chapter and then be changed up and flipped around a few chapters later. I just had to keep reading to find out what was truly going on. I loved Mac in this book and really like the person that she has become. I also adored Barrons in this book and enjoyed learning more about him and his past. I absolutely recommend this series to anyone that likes urban fantasy and think that this was a fantastic ending to the sereis. This was definitely my favorite book of the series.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|What a breath of fresh air!  A swashbuckling tale reminiscent of Robert Heinlein which compels the reader to turn the page.  The concept transferring consciousness to a superior physical clone is fascinating.  Loaded with humor and fast paced, this novel will not disappoint.  I gave it to my Mother-in -law who loves science fiction, but is very picky.  She read it in one setting!     [[ASIN:B003VD1G56 NetherWorld]]
B00005RHF8|1.0|I was at first happy to see that it was available.<br /><br />But I was very disappointed in the quality.<br /><br />I would have wanted to know that it was a really bad<br /><br />replica of the oringinal. The price should have given.<br /><br />that away. Only when I got it and started to watch did<br /><br />it say that it was a copy and that its quality was a reflection<br /><br />of the orginal that it was copied from. It was so bad that<br /><br />there was missed conversation in important parts from skipes<br />and stops in the DVD.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This one grabbed me from the first page.  I only wish there were novels such as this when I was a young adult.  Fast moving story with well developed characters.  Katniss is an excellent heroine for the target audience.  As soon as I finished this book, I ordered the next two in the series.  Dark, disturbing, and a bit bloody; but all in moderation with respect to the story.  Something in this book will appeal to a very broad audience![[ASIN:B003VD1G56 NetherWorld]][[ASIN:B003VD1G56 NetherWorld]]
B000QJLQY4|5.0|Timeless classic for any entrepreneur. Guy covered all the key important topics for entrepreneurs who are trying to start a company. He uses plain language, no-nonsense, and gives very applicable tips. Wonderful read!
B0000024W3|4.0|Come on CBS - when is this underrated album going to be remastered? Sure there are some numbers you could leave off, but there are also very many that are good, easy-listening country songs. The feel, music and voice on this album make it worthy of an upgrade.
B00013F35I|5.0|I am a Bruce Springsteen fan so I would probably like anything he put out.  But, when they put out a concert video, it is usually one of their best.  And this is one of Bruce's & E Street's best.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|This is a great, fast paced action film that keeps you engaged even though you can guess the outcome.  Great acting and camera work.  Great effects.  Great story...except one thing....<br /><br />***********SPOILER***********<br /><br />Remember the part where all the cops were shooting at the train trying to hit that little red emergency stop button?  You know, the one overtop the FUEL tanks?<br /><br />Well...then why didn't the fat guy at the beginning just push that instead of running and trying to get ON the train?<br /><br />I think it's a valid point, but then the film would have only lasted 10 minutes.<br /><br />***********OOPS!*************<br />We watched this again and my wife caught something.  Notice when toward the end as the trains go through towns that the train is already going past the crossing and the gates are coming down.  Remind me NOT to drive across tracks in Pennsylvania!
B002KSPKRS|4.0|I purchased 2 of these for both movie watching and video gaming.  First off, the have fantastic sound!  The sound envelopes you in a 3D experience and does not sound like it is coming from the headphones that you're wearing.  Very nice for movies and essential for gaming.  They have a very nice adjustable and removeable microphone. They do have a few down-sides which are: 1) There is a very anoying popping sound if you walk away from the transmitter more than 20 feet or so; 2) They do not have atuomatically recharging batteries when you store them on the holder (Turtle Beach should take a lesson from the Sennheiser company and their storage/recharge station for headphones like the HDR 130 which automatically recharges the headphones when you place them on the recharge station); 3) They are adjustable, but the comfort of the headphones is just OK, nothing like my Sennheiser HDR 130s; 4) It would be nice if the system were capable of switching between multiple optical inputs so that one could easily switch between gaming and movies.
B001D7CHAA|4.0|This is a book with a lot of information from more than one tradition. It's very well-rounded, focusing on protection against pretty much any element that could be used in attack, and acknowledges that attack happens more often than most are willing to admit. Some of the techniques are, however, very wordy which I don't see as very practical when they're needed the most. That is why I gave it four stars instead of five. There is also more emphasis, it seems to me, on ceremonial techniques than on other techniques, though other techniques are covered. That is to be expected, however, considering just who wrote the book. Ultimately, this serves as a very well-rounded and informative book that should be able to give just about anyone a starting point for self-defense in the energetic/magical/spiritual/psychic realm of life. It also comes WITHOUT the almost customary Wiccan preaching that most authors go overboard with in their books, which is a definite plus in my mind.
B000UCJWBG|4.0|For many Star Wars fans, [[ASIN:0345442970 Cloak of Deception]] will probably come off about as exciting as watching CSPANN. However, I'm also a political junkie and as such enjoyed seeing some of the political intrigue behind [[ASIN:B00003CX5P Star Wars - Episode I, The Phantom Menace]]. Luceno's effort in this regard is somewhat of a mixed success, but still enjoyable if you like political intrigue novels.    First, the good. I thought Luceno does a good job showing Palpatine's political maneuverings without exposing him as Darth Sidious. Remember, when the book was published, that connection hadn't been revealed. Palpatine comes across as modest in public but incisive in private. He often has the best scenes and lays the best traps. Luceno portrays Palpatine as a politician with firm convictions about the need for a strong central government, which makes him a more subtly interesting character than just an evil Sith lord.     The plot device is also fairly simple but effective for a political novel. Valorum is convinced (by Palpatine!) to tax the Trade Federation in return for allowing it to arm itself against terrorist attacks. The rest of the book follows the Jedi as they attempt to thwart the terrorists and various assassination plots. The events clearly leads to the blockade of Naboo at the beginning of the film and also explain how Naboo fit into Sidious' larger plan.     I also thought Qui-Gon Jinn was more enjoyable than he was in the movies. We get to see a bit more of his \\"roguish\\" traits, which the movies hinted at but never really explored. Qui-Gon comes across as someone more at ease in the underworld of life and willing to push the Jedi beyond their norm of non-interference.    Unfortunately, the book is marred by Luceno's sometimes clunky, overly descriptive writing style. There is a lot of telling rather than showing. Also, the other characters in the book don't come across well. I constantly felt as if the narrator was trying to convince the reader that Valorum is a good, dignified leader, but ironically too often Valorum seems to pathetically malleable to Palpatine's suggestions. Meanwhile, all the Jedi besides Qui-Gon come across as a bunch of bumbling idiots. None of them seem to realize that that should do more than just sit around the Jedi Temple and that there might actually be a threat that they should counter. The Nebula Front terrorists also seemed pretty shallow. They kept repeating the same few lines (essentially, \\"boy, I should retire soon\\"), and the book spends far too much time on these bit characters that make no other appearance in the Star Wars universe.    Overall, the book merits 3.5 stars. It's a decent setup for the film and has some fun political intrigue, but aside from Palpatine and Qui-Gon none of the characters are worth our time.

1594202842|5.0|Being a second-generation Asian (Korean American) and having been raised by a Tiger Mother as well, I read Amy Chua's account in one sitting--it's that kind of read. Powerful, provocative, and deeply heartfelt.    There aren't many parenting accounts out there that resonate with an immigrant's perspective, especially an Asian one. But Chua's book does. She takes great pains to remind us she was raised by first-generation Chinese immigrants from the Philippines and then lays her own story of raising her daughters on top of that foundation.    The backlash against this book is probably fueled in large part by jealousy and ignorance, by people who either didn't read the book or deliberately chose to misunderstand it.  This woman is a YALE LAW PROFESSOR who's written two previous best-sellers, and yet she still spends more time devoted to her children than most full-time mothers. Her energy and dedication are ferocious--and humbling. I wish I could be half the woman she is!     I live in a world where most moms can't be bothered to pick up their own children from school--let alone drive two hours every week on a Sunday for a violin lesson. In the me-centric Western world, it's all about the mom--Did she get her yoga and Pilates done today? Has she talked to her therapist? Is she feeling fulfilled?     I could go on and on. But Amy Chua is far more gracious than I could ever be--and a lot more successful, too. I'm taking a page from her book, and I'm going to work harder at being a Tiger Mother. I know my children will thank me for it.

B000N6TX1I|5.0|Every so often, you see a film that you know, instantly, is a classic.  This film is of that kind of quality:  it portrays a future world - an exaggeration of the present - that raises deep questions, is emotionally moving, and full of realistic action that adds to the themes.  In my opinion, this film is on the level of The Day the Earth Stood Still or Forbidden Planet, but it addresses current crises, from global economic breakdown and emigration to personal identity in a world gone wrong.  I was utterly riveted from the first minutes of the film, was moved at the plight of the mysterious child, and was inspired to wonder at what my children will face.<br /><br />I will try not to play the spoiler, but it is well known that this is about a dystopia that has arisen because suddenly, for reasons that no one can fathom, all women in the world have been infertile for nearly 20 years.  The sense of crisis at the demise of the human race is palpable in the chaos that has resulted:  the economic order is breaking down, illegal immigrants are hunted and forced into lawless ghettos, and human rights no longer exist except for a tiny slice of the elite population.  Gangs roam the countryside, the security apparatus of the state has few civil limits placed on it, and normal citizens are retreating into protected or hidden enclaves while radical activists seek to foment revolution.  My kids were appalled and frightened at this vision and watched with silent fascination, afterwards sparking a long discussion of where the world is headed for them.  We watched it twice, one viewing after the other.<br /><br />The central character, Dylan, is a broken man; he has given up and become cynical about his ideals, drinking for solace rather than contemplating action.  He is watching the world deteriorate around him, losing his empathy and unable to look ahead.  Then, his former lover - the mother of his deceased child - kidnaps him, asking for help.  What ensues is an adventure that renews his faith in humanity and the future, all the while highlighting the brutal machinations of those around him, who want to control what could be the savior of humanity.  He is a normal guy, thrust into what will become greatness.  I completely believed it, to the point that I got choked up at the climax.<br /><br />There are also some excellent commentaries with the version that I bought (2 disks of region 2).  There are documentaries with philosophers (e.g. Lovelock)  and  journalists (Naomi Kline, of whom I am a fan even though I am a moderate conservative) that are quite thought provoking.  Of course, there are also insipid promotional materials (\\"It was wonderful working with everyone\\"), but it is worth a look.<br /><br />Recommended with enthusiasm.

1594200440|5.0|I can't recommend this book more highly.  It's entertaining--comic, at times; and a real page turner--and it's also a dark glimpse into world history. While it's specific to a set of circumstances (a Ukrainian immigrant in his dotage, an opportunistic would-be-Ukrainian immigrant in search of legal status as his bride), it's universal in its depicition of family dynamics, the process of aging, the helplessness of those who watch their parents age, and the way sibling rivalries rarely get put to rest.  I was \\"in\\" from the first sentence and read it in a single day.

0439023513|2.0|Started out ok and was just as enthralling as the previous books of this series.  But the author progresses to needlessly killing off beloved characters and so much negativity as to be simply too much.  There is nothing redeeming; finally no hope for an even passablely happy life for the main characters.   In the end I couldn't wait to finish and be done with the misery of this book.  Had the series and the characters not gained my loyalty in the first 2 books, I would have put this one down at 2/3 of the way through...
B000O8OTNC|5.0|My sharpener just arrived, but it didn't take long to realize that this was a 5 star product. The needle-like steel is microfine, but you can feel it bite into an already sharp blade. The two sharpening levels are similar to other two stage sharpeners, one steel set of cutters for course, and ceramic rods for fine. But this pocket sized wonder adds that extra touch-up steel for that super sharp blade...<br /><br />Very satisfied with this purchase
B0018RWMNM|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time. I think the human conflicts are timeless. I originally bought a VHS version but it had cut out aboout 18 minutes for the series. For me, Those 18 minutes were/are VERY important to some nuances in the meaning of the movie. So, I make sure when I give it as a gift that I get the whole thing. People nowadays don't have much patience, so I find I have to \\"force\\" them to watch episode 1, but after that, they are \\"hooked\\". I think this is one of the best most \\"human\\" movies ever made. I NEVER get tired of seeing it and it never ceases to bring up a tear or two thousand. In my opinion, this movie is a TRUE classic about the human spirit. ...getting ready to order it again for another friend. One thing I tell people that I like about it the most is that the \\"good\\" people aren't always doing \\"good\\" things. There are good and bad flaws that come out in all the characters and isn't that closer to what life is really like???
B003UCPEJ2|2.0|I had read some \\"less than favorable\\" reviews on this collection prior to my purchase (warnings about bad CD quality).  I took my chances and hoped they were wrong.  Unfortunately, that was a bad decision.  Now, on the surface, this is fantastic collection of music.  Hard to find such a great collection in one place.  The problem is that the quality of the CD's is very poor, and one in six CD's were blank.  These are likely a low-budget burn from Korea/China.  The good news ... the seller was kind enough to fully refund for the CD's plus shipping to and from my home.  I appreciate the good sellers on Amazon.  This feedback forum should help buyers stay away from inferior products so that both buyers and sellers can have a great experience.  This collection is one to avoid.
0937381888|2.0|I have always wanted to learn to brew beer and after reading the glowing reviews thought this was the book I needed to get started.  After plowing through the first couple hundred pages of the book it permamnenetly cured me of my desire to brew beer.      It is almost incomprehensible and spends most of its pages on endless minutiae about the intracies of various steps in the brewing process and their endless variations.  I finally put it down when it was clear that after 200 hundred pages I really knew nothing more than when I started reading that would allow me to actually begin brewing.      The book has endless details designed for the advanced brewer but is not written with the novice in mind.  It has a vocabulary all its own and as a result is unapproachable for those who are not long time brewers.  Going back and re-reading some of the reviews it is clear they were written by those with considerable brewing knowledge already and the book does provide insight into those looking to advance their already considerable knowledge.  I wasn't looking for a biochemistry lesson but rather pratical knowledge that would let me begin a new hobby. Fortunately the book saved me from spending what appears to be hundreds of dollars on various pieces of equipment in what would have been an unsuccessful outcome.      I did put the book to good use.  After abandoning trying to decipher the tome, I went to my local distributor and bought a few wonderful craft beers.  I tossed the book on a roaring fire in the fireplace and enjoyed drinking a wonderful Belgian ale as I watched it burn.  It was the best beer I've ever had.  Thank you John Palmer for curing me of my interest in brewing and leaving it to the professionals.  I will put my time and efforts to a better use in a hobby that is approachable and can be actually be enjoyed.
B0037BB00I|5.0|When I first heard Adele, I was struck by the strength of her voice. It has a smoky quality to it, in a nice way. In short, it's unique and a joy to listen to it. When this album went on sale, I promptly downloaded it! My favorite songs in no particular order are: Best for last, Chasing pavements, Cold shoulder, Right as rain & Make you feel my love. I hope her new album '21' will be just as good.I like the sound of \\"Rolling in the deep\\". If you like this, listen to Duffy's Rockferry as well.
B003Y5H51K|2.0|\\"Sanctum\\" exemplifies what happens when innovation becomes more important than a screenplay. The story is contrived, calculating, and unpleasant, but never fear - James Cameron is the executive producer, and he will see to it that we gawk helplessly at the difficult camerawork, the authentically claustrophobic sets, and the 3D effects. Perhaps it was his intention for director Alister Grierson to experience his own private version of \\"The Abyss,\\" a technological breakthrough that came at the expense of a notoriously difficult shoot. The only difference is that, this time around, the needless suffering is reflected in the finished film, which tells a story so bleak and simple-minded that it's an insult to audiences, especially the ones that paid extra for the 3D glasses.    It's said to be based on a true story, but considering the way the plot unfolds, I can't help but take that claim with a grain of salt. It depicts an ill-fated scuba-diving expedition in Papua New Guinea's Esa-ala, a vast network of underground caves; the plan was to surpass a base camp deep beneath the surface and continue further in, but things take a turn for the worst when a massive storm floods the cave's opening and traps the people within. According to the team leader, Frank (Richard Roxburgh), it's merely a matter of finding an underground river and following its current, for all rivers flow towards the sea. He would, of course, say something like that, for he understands caves far better than the mind-numbing routine of CDs, mortgages, and fatherhood.    I've admitted in the past that I don't understand the thought processes of mountain climbers and thrill seekers. But movies about such people are usually made in such a way that we, the audience, can somehow respond to the unexplainable lure of nature. The best current example is \\"127 Hours\\"; even with James Franco's arm pinned between a dislodged bolder and a canyon wall, director Danny Boyle had the decency to explore the simplistic beauty of Blue John Canyon, to show the rock formations bathed in sunlight. Compare this to \\"Sanctum,\\" which takes place almost entirely within the confines of cramped, desolate, dark, waterlogged caves. Such locations fail to inspire a sense of awe. Because of this, it's virtually impossible to sympathize with any of the characters.    Not that they were well developed in the first place. Their primary function is to spew inane dialogue before displaying many of the ways in which a person can die in a scuba expedition. By the end of the movie, we will have seen examples of the bends, hypothermia, broken bones, and drowning - which, I'm sorry to say, isn't always an accidental occurrence. One of the characters, the girlfriend of the expedition's financier, is inexperienced as both a scuba diver and a mountain climber, and that sort of makes me wonder why she was allowed to join in the first place. She, along with just about everyone else, is as disposable as a teenager in a slasher film, and about as authentically written.    The only two characters that matter are Frank and his son, Josh (Rhys Wakefield). The more scenes they share, the more obvious it becomes that \\"Sanctum\\" was manufactured strictly for the purposes of watching them reconnect. They have never gotten along; Frank is an explorer who hears only to the call of the wild, and Josh has been forced to partake. But they have more in common than it might first appear, a revelation that pretty much exists only in movies like this. They will eventually find themselves in a commonplace survival scenario, one that involves someone who has gone mad out of desperation to escape. I'd expect this kind of thing from a western or a horror movie, but not from a man-against-nature drama.    Although not credited as one of the writers, I have an uneasy feeling that James Cameron contributed to the screenplay. Let me make it clear that I've always championed him as a filmmaker and storyteller, and that includes his latest effort, the monumentally successful \\"Avatar.\\" But now, I feel I must admit that, in one key area, he has consistently disappointed me: The man has a tin ear for dialogue. With \\"Aliens,\\" \\"The Abyss,\\" \\"Titanic,\\" and now with \\"Sanctum,\\" there is not a single line that sounds like something a person would actually say. You know something is wrong when the only way to counteract the effects of a bad scene is to overcompensate with foul language, which flows freely in just about every scene. This is a surprisingly bad movie, something that doesn't deserve the name of James Cameron.
B000OIBY4Y|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time. The books starts a little slow but picks up pace after the \\"murder\\". I don't want to give too much information away. But then nothing really happens in the book. This is more about how the guys feels or rather does not feel anything about everything happening around him. I am not veyr proud of it but I was able to relate to the character.
B002ZG99IG|2.0|\\"The Roommate\\" is essentially a college-age, low-rent retread of \\"Single White Female\\" - the story of a young woman whose life is interrupted by a possessive, deranged individual. But even if \\"Single White Female\\" hadn't been made, this movie would still be about as boring and predictable as they get. It's little more than a visual checklist of thriller clichés. Not those fun, stylistic clichés, but the dull and dreary ones, all of which were unoriginal twenty years ago and have long since overstayed their welcome. If you can't figure out where the plot will go as you watch it unfold, you're either lucky, for you've missed all the thrillers I've sat through, or you're remarkably imperceptive. I'll take it as an item of faith that it's the former. I beg you, don't prove me wrong.    In the film, a girl from Iowa named Sara Matthews (Minka Kelly) enters her freshman year at the University of Los Angeles, where she hopes to study fashion design. Assigned to share her dorm room is Rebecca Woods (Leighton Meester), born and raised in the affluence of Beverly Hills. At first, they get along swimmingly. But over time, Rebecca's behavior becomes increasingly odd, as if she wanted Sara all to herself. Mostly, it displays itself not through her interactions with Sara, but through her interactions with other people in Sara's life. These include her new boyfriend, Stephen (Cam Gigandet), her friend, Tracy (Alyson Michalka), her fashion mentor, Irene (Danneel Harris), and Professor Roberts (Billy Zane), who teaches design. At Thanksgiving, Rebecca takes Sara to meet her wealthy parents; the mom (Frances Fisher) will eventually ask Sara in private the obvious question, \\"Is she taking her medication?\\"    Most of the characters are so transparent that they might as well walk around with labels hanging around their necks. I'll refrain from the two leads, since I've pretty much described them already. But you'd enjoy reading the one for Professor Roberts; his expressions and sly glances at Sara would equate to, \\"I'm the lecherous creep who can't control himself around women.\\" Tracy's would read, \\"I'm the unreliable party girl,\\" while Irene's would read, \\"I'm the clueless lesbian.\\" As for Stephen, the frat house drummer boy, his would read, \\"I'm the only decent guy on campus who will love Sara for who she really is.\\" There isn't much more I can say about the character, but regarding Gigandet, he should thank his lucky stars that, at age twenty-eight, he looks young enough to pass for a college student.    As Rebecca systematically takes care of anyone who gets between her and Sara, two plot points are introduced, neither of which is developed beyond its purpose as a thriller contrivance. The first is Sara's ex-boyfriend (Matt Lanter), who repeated calls and is eventually teased by Rebecca when she suddenly has access to Sara's cell phone. The second is the sudden appearance of a kitten, who Sara dubs Cuddles. Only one thing can happen when a cute, innocent animal has a guest spot in a movie like this. If you don't know what that thing is, please, don't make me tell you. As a cat owner, it's not something I enjoy dwelling on or even mentioning.    I'm tempted to issue a spoiler warning so that I can discuss in detail the ways in which the ending fails to deliver. It's traditional in thrillers for the final confrontation to be implausible, but it isn't often they're so devoid of style; the face-off between Sara and Rebecca is short and shows a painful lack of motivation. Is it because writer Sonny Mallhi exhausted all possible clichés by the fortieth page of the screenplay and simply stopped trying? What I find really disappointing is that, in spite of the unoriginal plot, he demonstrates on more than one occasion that he has an ear for dialogue, and you don't find that too often in movies like this. If he could apply this talent to more fulfilling story, he may have a future in showbiz.    I find these kinds of movies incredibly frustrating, mostly because they suggest a severe lack of confidence in the audience, as if the filmmakers - or perhaps the studio, or both - don't trust that people are by in large intelligent. To release \\"The Roommate\\" and actually expect moviegoers to be thrilled by it is insulting. Thrills are by definition surprising. Surprises are by definition unforeseen. They're also by definition impossible in a story that thrives on tiresome formulas and cardboard characters. But by taking the time to point this out, I realize I've been just as condescending as the people who made this movie. You don't need me to spell this out for you. You're reading this right now, and I know you're smart. Don't let movies like this deaden your imagination.
B000071ZZI|5.0|A true thriller.  Be ready to put on your seatbelts because Jason keeps your heart  in your mouth.  As part of the Bourne trilogy, it is a winner, and keeps you on  the edge of your seat...as a thriller should.
0060005696|4.0|In modern capitalist societies there is more pressure than ever to 'have it all'. We are privy to witness the choices and lifestyles of many more people than was ever possible in the pre-mass media age, and comparison between ourselves and others is inevitable. And it makes us miserable.<br /><br />This is just one of the phenomena discussed in Schwartz's book which is a well researched guide to present some of the research theory about choice, in clear language, with compelling examples. No choice is terrible, but an abundance of choice can lead to paralysis, and regret once we do make a decision. This is exacerbated if we are 'maxmisers' - people seeking to get the best result from every decision, rather than 'satisficers'- those who seek the 'good enough' from each decision. If we aim to maximise, we lead ourselves to being worse off in the long run as we can never really be satisfied with the choices we make.<br /><br />Schwartz's ideas lead to compelling conclusions about how we should make the big choices in our lives - where to live, what job to take, how we should engage with long term relationships. Consumer junkies, sucking for too long at the pap of the 'you can have it all' drivel, would be well advised to take note.
B003EYVXUU|3.0|After having watched Let The Right One In I was excited to see this film.  I read that the director/writer had made his own version of the book(not the original movie) so I expected a bit of difference between films.  What he really did was copy the exact same script as Let The Right One In, change one scene, add another and slap his name on it.  Throughout the film the dialogue exchanges are literally the exact same as Let The Right One In.  Unfortunately, the translation does not work very well in English and the dialogue can sometimes sound unbelievable. Shame on Reeves for not just writing his own version of the story.  I give this three stars only because if Let The Right One In didn't exist, this would be a good film.  Of course, if that film did not exist, this one wouldn't either.

0307272702|5.0|First I have to say I have read every fad diet book out there and I have probably lost over a 100 lbs over my lifetime, (probably more) and now I am type 2 diabetic with a belly roll that I cannot seem to get rid of no matter how much I exercise! Since I was probably pre-diabetic for years before being diagnosed I had no idea the damage I was doing cutting the fat and eating all those carbs! And now comes this book; which after reading numerous books on diabetes and being throughly confused and frustrated, the light is finally going off in my head thanks to the many studies Gary Taubes sites in this book.  The only way to get rid of the extra glucose and that belly roll is to cut the \\"bad\\" cards, (flour,sugars). When I was diagnosed initally I naturally cut the carbs and increased my exercise (to burn the glucose) and the pounds did start coming off, but I can see now that I have to do more and stick to it. Read what insulin and other hormones do in our body and how fat is stored and burned, you'll learn so much!   I cannot wait to see my A1C in 4 months!  Thanks so much for this very informative book!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I picked up the book before it got so popular and loved it from page 1!!! The story of Katniss in a destroyed America fighting for her life and for those she loves.    I tought it was fast paced and kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end. The characters had great personality and went well with Katniss. It was pretty descriptive and expressed the character well.    It had a really good plot and story. The romance was great and how the games were. I only had a few problems with the book.    First, it didn't describe Katniss very well. When I was readimg it, I completley missed the part where it said she had black hair. It didn't explain her features well either. So I just pictured her with blonde hair and blue eyes for the rest of the trilogy.    Another thing was that it was a little too graphic. I mean, kids killing eachother? Sounds a little violent doesn't it? And how they described the wounds, the fighting, I would not recommend this to a ten year old.    But over all it was a great and thrilling read for people 12 and up.
076115678X|5.0|If your hair doesn't have curls, coils, kinks or waves, you might wonder why anyone would need a book about hair.  (You've also probably never left a salon in tears, a common occurrence for girls with curls.)  If you do have hair that bends, you know how hard it is to find that information, and a stylist who understands and respects your hair's natural propensities.<br /><br />The first edition of &#34;Curly Girl&#34; was a real eye opener, and worth every penny, as far as I was concerned!  The new (second) edition, published ten years later, is expanded and revised, has improved graphics, and comes with a DVD which covers all of the most important parts in excellent video segments.  The book chapter and video segment on trimming your own curls are invaluable, even if you're lucky enough to have someone you can trust to give you a great curly cut.<br /><br />I've been following Lorraine Massey's method of curl care for almost seven years, and been extremely happy with the results.
1594488843|5.0|Daniel Pink starts off Drive by showing that extrinsic motivators, such as higher monetary reward, generally adversely affect cognitive performance (except for pro-forma piece-work). In an era when creativity counts more than ever for corporate performance this, then, is a key reason to find out what are the key internal or intrinsic motivators.     Drive then pulls together academic research conducted over the past four decades to show that the very highest individual and corporate accomplishments can happen when three intrinsic motivators are incorporated into (individual, team, company) life. They are:      ·         Autonomy (over one's life);    ·         Mastery (the opportunity to pursue it at the subject matter level);    ·         Purpose (being part of a larger, nobler purpose)                     Some of the research on Autonomy is detailed on pages 90 and 91, wherein the author states that        \\"A sense of autonomy has a powerful effect on individual performance and attitude. According to a cluster of recent behavioral science studies, autonomous motivation promotes greater conceptual understanding, better grades, enhanced persistence at school and, in sporting activities, higher productivity, less burnout and greater psychological well-being. Those effects carry over to the workplace. ... For example, researchers at Cornell University studied 320 small businesses, half of which granted workers autonomy; the other half relied on top-down direction. The businesses that offered autonomy grew at four times the rate of the control-oriented firms and had one-third the employee turnover. Yet too many businesses remain woefully behind the science.\\"    He also calls out the notions of empowerment and engagement as hollow versions of what true autonomy looks like. Pink also, however, says that autonomy is not supposed to be a lack of accountability. In summary on Autonomy, Pink call says that this era doesn't call for \\"better management\\"; it calls for a renaissance of self-direction.      I personally found the portion relating to Mastery to be the most interesting. Pink starts off by discussing the concept of \\"flow\\" which is the blessed time when you are totally engaged in a subject, virtually to the exclusion of the outside world. He moves from flow to show how this is related to desire for mastery, which he defines as \\" the desire to get better and better at something that matters [to that person]\\". He says (and provides research backing this) that mastery abides by three laws, which are:    1.       The view that mastery is a learning goal, rather than a performance goal. In other words, mastery isn't a report card to celebrate or frown on. Those who pursue and enjoy mastery are those most likely to consider their successes and travails as simply part of their learning goal.     2.       The stretch to achieve mastery is [can be] painful. Mastery requires grit, and dedicated practice. Mastery requires (\\"difficult, painful, excruciating, all-consuming\\") effort for long periods of time; one researcher says you need intense practice for a minimum of 10 years. As one researcher has called it, \\"the mundanity of excellence\\".    3.       Mastery is an Asymptote. That is, mastery is a straight line that a curve (the mastery \\"student\\") never quite reaches. In the end, Pink says, mastery attracts precisely because mastery eludes.     Finally, Pink arrives at Purpose. He says that the most deeply motivated, productive, and satisfied people are engaged in the service of some higher objective. He pulls from the non-profit sector to illustrate this (volunteer hours are rising rapidly; and further well illustrated by ventures such as Wikipedia, Linux operating system, Apache, Open Office). As well, he says, the fact that there are a rising number of corporations that have other than a profit motive at their core also prove this. Although this is the weakest part of the book from an academic research viewpoint, it certainly isn'ttoo hard to buy into his message. Which is this: people in service of a large noble goal, are going to have unbelievably strong intrinsic drivers. This is something that the book Start with Why, by Simon Sinek, examines on a (mostly) corporate level.     I hope to complete that book review soon, as these two books have a common axis at the Purpose/Why junction.    In summary, Drive is a worthy book that helps you understand what produces personal satisfaction at work. To the extent that managers and executives are ready to receive this message, and incorporate it into daily working life, is to the extent that their corporations will flourish into the future.

With more compartments and without the worry of it swinging around as I'm climbing steep grades, I feel that this should've been my first purchase.  Although a little bulky for everyday use, its several, well padded compartments, is great for anyone with multiple lenses.
B001QWBM62|5.0|Purchased this item to compliment the sound for DSLR videos and for the slide shows that I produce for my photo business. The great thing about using this recorder, is that you have access to so many ways to use this item. There are some very complicated setups, but also you can record something in a very easy way.    The HN4 comes with a great manual that explains everything that you need to know. The quality of the recorded sound is great for a piece of equipment this size. For me this has helped make live recordings a real easy job.
1439152780|3.0|I also am a fan of Kate Morton's previous two novels.  I love the creepy, Victorian gothic atmosphere she created in her earlier books.  The Distant Hours had the atmosphere, but was way too long, as many reviewers mentioned, overwritten and totally predictable.  What reader couldn't guess the fate of poor Thomas Cavill?  Kate Morton does create some chilling moments and a few nice twists and turns but on the whole, very predictable and slow starting.

B004CLYKLI|5.0|After reading 'The Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother' by Amy Chua, I would say a lot of critics seem to have missed her intent of writing the book.    From the outset, Chua has not intended to write a parenting guide for other mothers (and fathers) to follow.  It is a therapeutic memoir born of her utter defeat at a public showdown between her and her younger daughter Lulu who smashed a glass and blurted out in front of many other restaurant patrons, \\"I hate you! I HATE YOU. You don't love me.  You think you do, but you don't.  You just make me feel bad about myself every second.  You've wrecked my life.  I can't stand to be around you.\\"   Just imagine how heartbreaking such words were for a working mother who had spent most of her time supervising her kids' schoolwork and coaching them to become accomplished musicians - a pianist who played at the prestigious Carnegie Hall at the age of 14 and a violinist who became the concertmaster of a youth orchestra at the age of 13.    Indeed, Chua has enjoyed her fleeting moments of glory, taking great pride in her daughters' academic and musical achievements, but such glory seemed worthless when Lulu rebelled against her control and worse still, literally hated her. That was probably why Chua wrote at the beginning of the book, \\"This was supposed to be a story of how Chinese parents are better at raising kids than Western ones.  But instead, it's about a bitter clash of cultures, a fleeting taste of glory, and how I was humbled by a thirteen-year-old.\\"       Most of us parents may have experienced the same perplexity, that is, how to help our children become high achievers while maintaining a strong bond with them.  Most of us would agree with Chua's observations: the world has become intensely competitive, but a lot of our young people who spend 10 hours a day on Facebook and online games are in no way adequately prepared for the future.  Many of them can't even spell or write properly, let alone read and think critically.Most importantly, these kids don't have the stamina to stand up to challenges and usually give up far too easily in face of difficulties.  To counter such degeneration, Chua resorted to `tough love' and set strict discipline and high expectations on her girls, and predictably, her parenting method worked when her daughters were small but backfired as the kids started to seek control of their own lives in their teens.    From my experience as an educator and father, I think it is possible for us to set high standards while allowing our kids to have their choices.  After all, our kids can never be successful unless they internalize the goals and set their minds to achieving them.  Amy Chua had a similar awakening when she finally allowed Lulu to pursue her passion in tennis and saw her unbeatable determination on the court, and said \\"She's indomitable, I thought to myself, and always has been.  Wherever she ends up, she's going to be amazing.\\"     Our kids are going to be amazing when they discover their own paths to living life to the fullest, and they are more likely to thrive under the guidance of loving yet firm parents than those who resort to threats, insults and violence.      Personally, I like the book very much.  The author was candid and sincere in her reflective memoir.  But we should not repeat her mistakes.

B001UV4XI8|5.0|I have previously been relatively unsatisfied with some of the movies due to a combination of poor script adaptation, suffering CG sequences or lack of acting prowess from a number of principal actors.  \\"Deathly Hallows, Part 1\\", however, is one of the only Harry Potter movies I walked away from without feeling it was incomplete in the way I felt about some of the other films. I was actually very satisfied with the end result, even with the changes it had, and felt strongly enough about it to see it again another 4 times.  There are obvious limitations when bringing a book to life on the big screen like budget problems and time constraints, actor availability, finding suitable and affordable filming locations and hiring a CGI company with the chops to get the job done.  I thought this movie addressed the shortcomings in prior films because most of what I saw I thought was done exceedingly well, both on the part of the crew and the actors.    PROS:    Nearly everything in this movie conveyed a sense of impending doom and haunting depression, even the rusted and dilapidated WB logo at the start of the film.  That sense of malcontent and sadness has been a big source of criticism from some, mostly those who have not read the book and don't understand that the feeling of hopelessness is canon in a majority of the plot.  That said, I found it to be appropriate, even if a little exhausting at some parts such as the times where we see Harry and Hermione slowly gathering their things, without speaking to each other, getting ready to change locations, just to set up again without speaking.  This movie is about a war and, although it's primarily viewed on the periphery, war is never happy.  Relationships are severely tested and splintered in this installment, but such is the life of someone who has been tasked with a near-impossible job, with limited knowledge of how to handle and complete the task, with the added burden of having few allies to turn to, no family and no contact with friends, all while being hunted by a racist, fascist government.  It's not exactly a walk in the park for Harry, so to those who are criticizing the gloominess of the movie, try to keep that perspective in mind.  The book conveys those feelings of overwhelming depression well and I think the movie does as well as it can, without the help of the creative exposition that is the luxury of the written word.    I thought the crew did an excellent job setting the tone of scenes with lighting and camera angles and finding gorgeous filming locations that took my breath away.  They were far more beautiful, unique and - more poignantly - much lonelier than I pictured in my head when I read the book; that to me was one of the things that contributed heavily to the sadness the heroes felt.  This was also one of the few things that I thought the movie did better than book.  And I don't say that lightly or very often.    The relationships between the characters are so very strained the whole novel; I felt this was handled well in the movie, though I confess it was something I was very worried about going in.  Prior to this movie, there haven't been many opportunities for our heroes to express and sustain emotions as powerful and deep as the emotions they experience in this novel, and I while I've enjoyed the previous movies, I've always felt the actor's abilities (especially those of our 3 heroes) left something to be desired and I wasn't sure they could hack the more intense emotional scenes.  I was relieved to find that they did very well in many of the major scenes, such as the big fight that sends Ron packing.  I was so happy with the way this scene went, nearly word for word faithful to the book and acted wonderfully by Grint and Radcliffe.   Another favorite was the scene when was Ron is Splinched coming out of the Ministry.  I about cried the first time simply because of Watson's feeling during that ordeal, it was very impressive.  Also, her performance in the scene at Malfoy Manor was incredibly unnerving.  That scene was difficult to watch and had a few people around me covering their eyes.    Harry's birthday was cut out entirely, which I'm reasonably fine with; there was nothing hugely important in that chapter that couldn't have been put where it ended up and I felt that was an acceptable re-write.  In fact, I quite enjoyed seeing sneaky big brother George (complete with a toothbrush stuck tactlessly in his wound) coming in to embarrass Ginny And Harry.  I felt that scene was one of the most awkward of the film, mostly because I find the \\"chemistry\\" between Radcliffe and Wright to be pathetically strained, put-on and creepy to watch.  Oliver Phelps (George) saved that scene.    I also appreciated that when everyone regroups at the Burrow after the \\"Seven Harrys\\" scene, they gave Mr. Weasley's lines in the book (or the equivalent of his lines) to Fred instead.  I felt that was a nice touch, and even as I was reading Deathly Hallows the first time through, the whole time I thought it would have been more touching and appropriate to give Fred more of an interaction with his twin than he had in the book.  It was so moving that even the audience seemed to breathe the same sigh of relief that Fred did.  That's tough to manage in a film so major kudos to the sorely underused and underappreciated Phelps brothers.  I had high standards for the portrayal of Fred and George from the beginning due to the fact that they easily number among my favorite characters of the whole series, and I'm very pleased that James and Oliver deliver so well every time we see them.    CONS:    The only scene that was cut that I truly actually missed, was the scene when Kreacher tells the trio the heartbreaking truth about Sirius's brother Regulus; a truth that not even Sirius or the rest of his family knew.  Although it probably would have taken up a full 5 minutes in the film - a hugely long time for a theatrical scene - in order to convey the message accurately and do the story justice, I still missed it since it was inspiring to learn about Regulus' bravery and sacrifice.  That scene also marked the beginning to Kreacher's newfound loyalty to Harry, which comes into play later on.  I hope we'll see at least some mention of in Part 2, even though the fact that the basis for it was cut from Part 1 may make the connection in Part 2 seem a little random so those who haven't read the books.    Another thing I didn't like, but don't blame \\"Part 1\\" for, is the immense amount of damage control it had to do after the shoddy, rushed offering that was \\"Half-Blood Prince\\".  It seemed like all the loose ends that were introduced in HBP and were important to the overall story but we cut out of HBP were all stuffed into the \\"Seven Harrys\\" sequence.  It was like as each character comes into the room, they have to stop and explain themselves to Harry (or rather, the viewing audience) since Yates failed to include those many major points in HBP.  It's too bad the \\"Deathly Hallows, Part 1\\" has to take the heat for that shortcoming.    My one major criticism would be the soundtrack.  With the exception of the song \\"Obliviate\\" at the beginning, I found the music to be unremarkable and that it added next to nothing to the movie.  As a former music student and performer for many years, I tend to listen very hard for a movie's soundtrack (harder than many of my friends and family members do) and look for a good connection between the movie and music, since music has the power to convey so much that actors or good lighting simply can't.  I just didn't find that in Part 1.  A good score can be easily used to express a message or feeling in a scene, but I can't remember a point in the movie when I felt moved by anything on the soundtrack.  I wish they'd stuck with John Williams or another proven veteran, rather than change things up, though I understand scheduling conflicts probably came into play.  The dreariest, saddest music can also easily be the most beautiful and stirring, but this soundtrack really disappointed me.  Had the movie not been so good as to prevent me from really caring about how bland the music was, I might have rated it lower.    -----------    As for the criticisms I've been seeing from others, one of the most common ones is that it's \\"only half a movie\\".  In order to preserve the integrity of the conclusion to the biggest selling book series of all time, it was split into two parts to allow for more time to address as much of the canon story as possible without rushing or cutting out too much detail that's so critical to the plot.  Some also complained it dragged.  This isn't a fair criticism for the movie since the camping scenes dominate the novel too, so to those who don't like it, take it up with Rowling, because the movie sticks to her book very well.  Actually, there's more camping in the book than there is in the movie, if I remember correctly.  Still, I didn't mind the camping scenes, since it illustrated the fact that Harry and Hermione (and Ron) really struggled with their goal while also having to be on the run for a majority of the story.    Another popular critical judgment is the debated reason for the split in the first place.  Was Part 1 merely a \\"lead-in\\" to Part 2?  Just a \\"filler\\" or \\"built-up tease\\", as I've seen some critics and fans write?  To each his/her own, I suppose.  My opinion on it is no, it's not filler, and certainly not a way to squeeze more money out of the franchise, as a popular and shrewd argument that's been getting repeated quite a bit says.  However, if it were true, and money were the only driving force here - which I don't agree that it is - then please keep in mind that WB, whose purpose it is as a business is to bring in as much profit as possible, then really, what's the complaint here?  A corporation in a capitalistic society trying to cash in on something people like?  Perfectly understandable.    But like I said above, I do not agree that the choice to split it was based on money-grubbing.  That decision was about maintaining the integrity of the story and I think a lot of people who've read the book can agree that this would have been a total let-down had the powers-that-be allowed all of Deathly Hallows to be stuffed into a single movie.  It's easy for those who are unfamiliar with the books to criticize that decision now simply because they don't know what's all to come from this point on, while the readers know that there's still A LOT of story in \\"Deathly Hallows\\" left to cover.  I'll be very interested to see if that attitude changes after Part 2 is released.  When they see just how much story is crammed into the final installment (certainly in the book and hopefully in the movie, assuming it does a good job of staying true), I think many of them will be forced to rethink that original opinion.  I think the 2-part split was for the best.    Overall, I was impressed and very satisfied with how Part 1 was translated on-screen.  I, like many others, are stoked for Part 2 and can't wait to see how the movie brings to life the conclusion of the best-selling book series of all time.  I'm just annoyed there's an 8-month wait between Part 1 and 2.  Is it July 15th yet?!
0307341550|5.0|This was one very different mystery, thriller. I'm so tired of reading the same plot lines and stories which are so predictable you can't wait to get it over with. But this book had me guessing until it was getting close to the end. Then when I realized who the killer was, I couldn't wait to see how it all came together. This is one of those books you can't put down, it catches you right from the first chapter. It's easy going for a while then it just gets weirder and weirder until the end. If you're looking for a great read that is totally different than all those other books on the bestseller lists or those you hear about, here's a real sleeper that will keep you wide awake.
B002ZG99NG|2.0|Before I actually review this movie I should probably clarify my stance on Ben Affleck as he is quite a polarizing figure in the sphere of movie fans.  I am neither a 100% lover or hater of him or his films.  He's done some excellent work that can be considered amongst the classics and some \\"not so excellent\\" work that is at times, down right embarrassing.    I will say that I thought his directorial debut in Gone Baby Gone was absolutely masterful.  The storyline, pacing, casting, acting and character development were all brilliantly executed in my opinion, (despite the fact that it did not necessarily receive great reviews).    So go figure, when I read most of the reviews for this movie singing its' praises and objecting to those who compare it to Heat, I nearly just said forget it and purchased this without viewing it for myself.  All I can say is, I am so glad I rented this one first.  How can anyone who has seen Heat not feel like this movie is almost a complete rip off?    PLOT SPOILERS    There's the gang of four who specialize in bank heists.  There's the older/wise middle man who helps set up the jobs.  There's the famously unattached leader who all of a sudden finds himself in love and wants to run away from his current life alongside his new found love.  There's the loyal \\"gang member\\" who tells him he really needs the money.  There's the relentless cop who will stop at nothing to get his man and seems to know just the right punches to pull at just the right time. Then, the ultimate coup de grace.  There's the perfectly planned caper spoiled RIGHT at the last second when a tip puts the cops at the scene of the crime just as it's getting to the finish line.  I could go on, but those highlights really cover enough.    END SPOILERS    And this is coming from someone who loved Ben's first movie and really wanted to like this one too.  I mean come on Ben, did you not see Heat?  If anyone watching this movie didn't see Heat, then this could probably/possibly be a pretty good movie for you.  Even though there wasn't a lot of character development and chemistry between the cast members, the story moves along O.K. and there are very few out and out bad scenes.    Otherwise, for those of you who take objection to the Heat comparisons, add me to the list of people whose reviews you don't like.  Because this was an extremely disappointing, derivative movie that left me feeling totally empty at the end.  While some of you will totally disagree with this review, I guess I would just tell those who haven't seen this yet to rent before you buy.  Gone Baby Gone was probably a 4.5 star movie.  This one I give a 2.
B004LRZ2YC|5.0|Having really enjoyed the Swedish \\"Let the Right One In\\", I thought this might be the typical poorly done American-remake.  I was very wrong.  Extremely well done relationships between the boy and \\"girl\\" - perhaps even better then the original.  The old photobooth picture was a great addition in hinting to the background.  This version really focuses on the courting process the vampire was engaged in with the boy. Moving emotional story that is well acted.

0786955554|5.0|So, I bought these while running the D&D Essentials campaign, Reavers of Harkenwold.  The second part of this campaign requires your own map building, so I felt this was a good time to purchase this set.  I can't really add to the other reviews, it is excellent stuff.  But I do have a tip.<br /><br />SAVE THE PUNCHOUT BORDERS!  I have already started trimming some of these up to create walls, barriers, etc.  It's great to stick them down on top of the larger 8x8's when you want to segment a room.  A little blue sticky tack will hold it in place, and it gives the space the slightest of dimension, which helps your players immerse even more.  It isn't a replacement for 3D props, but it is certainly usable for DM's on a budget (like me).
B0034G4OZE|4.0|A depressed high schooler commits himself in to a psychiatric ward and discovers himself.  After a year of suicidal thoughts and dreams, caused by the stress of getting in to a good school, Craig (Gilchrist) commits himself \\"accidentely\\" to a psych ward at the local hospital.  While there he meets new friends Noelle (Roberts) and Bobby (Zach Galifianakis) and realizes he has more to give.  The subject matter is serious but the movie is actually pretty light-hearted and...kind of funny...(get it?).  Galifianakis plays a different role in this then we are used to, but does a good job with it and I would not be surprised to see more like this come his way.  I can't talk too much about this without giving anything away but I would definatly pick this one up.  A feel good movie about mental patients, how many of those have you seen?  I give it a B+.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - Yes, I think I would.
B0001ARCFA|1.0|Very tinny sounding and this is on quality tracks... not mp3's. If you like bass/bass accentuation don't bother. The only music I can really stand hearing with these is classical. Also, they are surprisingly quiet. I am generally sensitive to loudness but I found, even when at their max, to be weak with some tracks. I am surprised at how many positive reviews there are of these headphones. They just don't do it for me. I'm sending them back.
0553805371|4.0|The Grand Design, while still qualifying an helpful general overview of cosmology for nonscientists, is in its essence, a profoundly unpersuasive book about metaphysics, in which Hawking asks the questions:<br /><br />\\"Why is there something rather than nothing?<br /><br />\\"Why do we exist?<br /><br />\\"Why this particular set of laws and not some other?\\"<br /><br />but refuses to acknowledge the conclusions which his own summary of the evidence should properly lead him to.<br /><br />Specifically, Hawking's stated goal is to establish that it is at least \\"possible to answer these questions purely within the realm of science, without invoking any divine beings.\\"  What is remarkable in this formulation is its tacit admission that the evidence for a deliberate design of the universe for the purpose of supporting life has become so overwhelming, the best an atheist  such as Hawking (per his ex-wife ) may do is merely to try to prevent the case for a kind of intelligent design to be formally declared made. Remarkably, Hawking fails even in this modest ambition. Even if there are persuasive answers to these questions within the realm of science, they do not emerge from this book.<br /><br />The problem for atheists and agnostics is that, as Hawking forthrightly acknowledges, \\"Our universe and its laws appear to have a design that is both tailor-made to support us and if we are to exist leaves little room for alteration. This is not easily explained, and raises the natural question of why it is that way.\\" The chances of the laws of physics having been randomly set to support life seems so astonishingly small as to be for all practical purposes, zero. As Hawking noted in A Brief History of Time \\"If the rate of expansion one second after the Big Bang have been smaller by even one part in 100,000 million million, the universe would have re-collapsed before it ever reached its present size.\\" And this is only one of the 6 rules of physics, the precise setting of which were identified by physicist Martin Rees in his book [[ASIN:0465036732 Just Six Numbers: The Deep Forces That Shape The Universe]] as essential to the existence of life. Nor do these 6 numbers include the very peculiar fact that in order for carbon to exist in any appreciable quantities \\"the sum of the energies of a beryllium nucleus and a helium nucleus must be almost exactly the energy of a certain quantum state of the isotope of carbon formed, a situation called a resonance, which greatly increases the rate of a nuclear reaction\\". The odds of this occurring randomly was deemed so small by the man who predicted it that he, Astronomer Fred Hoyle, asserted that \\"I do not believe that any scientist to examine the evidence would fail to draw the inference that the laws of nuclear physics have been deliberately designed with regard to the consequences they produce inside the stars\\". The same inference could just as easily be made regarding the fact that so many other laws of nature seem so precisely calibrated to support life.<br /><br />This is an inference however Hawking declines to make, most likely because \\"Some would claim that the answers to these questions is that there is a God whose chose to create universe that way.\\" Unfortunately for those whose world view is premised upon belief in a random and meaningless universe, Hawking's alternative explanation, as set forth in this book, is completely unpersuasive  Briefly, as best I can tell, Hawking's argument boils down invocation of M-Theory and Feynman's multiple-histories theory to suggest that there are innumerable alternative universes with different laws of physics, the vast majority of which do not support life, leaving it no more than a matter of random chance at least one does. However, the fact that M-theory allows for this possibility or that multiple-histories, as applied by Hawking, assumes it, offers little actual reason to believe that such alternative universes really do exist.<br /><br />Hawking observes that \\"The laws of M-theory ... allow for different universes with different apparent laws, depending on how the internal spaces curled. M-theory has solutions that allow for many different internal spaces, perhaps as many as 10 to the 500th power which allows for ten to the 500th power different universes, each with its own laws.\\" And because the M-Theory allows for this enormous amounts of Universes, therefore apparently such Universes must exist, and it is simply our good fortune to live in one of the few numbers of such Universes that allow for life.<br /><br />The problem with this reasoning is it assumes that because the M-theory \\"allows\\" for different universes with different laws, that is reason enough to believe they exist. This is a breathtaking logical leap, something akin to saying because the laws of physics allow for the possibility that aliens are abducting human being and harvesting them for their sperm and eggs to create an alien-human hybrid species, therefore they are. However, the mere fact that something is not impossible is not evidence of its existence. The Constitution allows for any child born in the United States (except for the children of diplomats) to become president after the age of 35. Nevertheless, for me to insist that Yemen-based Islamic cleric Anwar al-Awlaki will eventually become President simply because he was born in the United States (not of diplomats) and is over 35 years old is probably not going to convince many people to contribute to his campaign.<br /><br />Hawking's other argument for the existence of multiple universes is so obviously fallacious that it is remarkable that a man of his extraordinary learning and intelligence could even seriously propose it. He starts off by reasoning from Feynman's multiple histories theories that no quantum event has a single history, but actually a virtual infinity of histories, and the only way to predict the outcome of any particular quantum event is to sum all the possible events which might occur and divide it in some way to come up with the likelihood of any particular outcome. Thus in describing how photons pass through the slits in the screen in the famous \\"double slit\\" experiment, one must take into account the possibility that the photon may have circled around Jupiter before arriving it its final destination. Therefore, Hawking argues, that to determine how the Universe got to its present state, one must sum up all the possible different states it could have begun with, including, apparently, those 10 to the 500th power different possible starting states of the Universe allowed by M theory. Therefore, given the fact that we human beings exist, ultimately when one sums up and divides all these alternative histories, one arrives again at the fact that we are fortunate enough to live up in one of the few (or perhaps only) Universe which allows for our existence.<br /><br />The problem is that this argument simply assumes away the question. To use the alien abduction analogy again, its like saying that the double slit experiment demonstrates that there are human-abducting extraterrestrials because in developing the necessary sums to determine the outcome of the experiment one must take into possibility that a photon travelled to the mothership orbiting the earth and passed through a memorandum setting forth their insidious hybrid insemination scheme. In short, for Hawking's version of multiple histories to take into consideration multiple alternative universes, it must assume multiple alternative universes exist. Assumptions are not evidence, a legal principle even physicists should be somewhat acquainted with.<br /><br />At the end of the day, the one point which must be conceded to Hawking and other like Richard Dawkins and Martin Rees who rely upon belief in multiple alternative universes to avoid the otherwise inescapable conclusion that the Universe is designed to support life,  is that there is no evidence to conclusively demonstratethat such alternative universes do not exist, just as there is no conclusive evidence that human abducting aliens do not exist either. But actually that's not a fair comparison. There is in fact, at the very least, an immense amount of testimonial evidence of alien abduction. However, there is no evidence at all for the existence of multiple universes merely, as Hawking correctly notes, various (untested) theories which may allow for the possibility of their existence, just as surely as there are in fact far more reliable and tested theories allowing for the possibility of extraterrestrial kidnappers and the future presidency of Imam Al-Awaki.<br /><br />So while Hawking is ultimately correct to assert that it is possible to answer his questions \\"purely within the realm of science, without invoking any divine beings\\", it would have been more candid to add that there is no evidence at all to support the suggested possibilities, while the evidence that the law of physics were precisely calibrated to support life is somewhere between enormous and overwhelming. The fact that Hawking feels compelled to raise  such unconvincing arguments for refuting  the case for the strong anthropic principle as he does in this book is a testimony to just how desperate non-theists have become in their efforts to deny the obvious.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the book is still well worth reading for its entertaining and informative overview of the current state of cosmology.ny particular outcome.

B003YP7N9O|5.0|I remember being at college in central Wisconsin, one dark night in April 1970, sitting alone in a big stone quarry, watching an awesome lightning storm approach. I ran back to my room just as the rain was hitting, to listen to a loaned LP record by a really hairy band of young Britons-- &#34;Stand Up&#34; by Jethro Tull!  They jumped out at you from the green, leafy album gatefold, like a hippie-era greeting card. The songwriter and obvious leader, one Ian Anderson, dressed like a rustic woodsman with thigh-high deerskin boots, and from his belt dangled a small sack of-- what? Later, when I knew more about Ian, I would suppose it was pipe-tobacco.  All that was amusing, but how were the ten songs?  Fantastic, exciting, exotic, varied!  Ian blew a mad flute, and sang like a rugged, honest, buckskinned frontiersman, full of adventure, humor, and romance.  Love was often lost and regretful, and he endured much tension visiting the old family manor.  But there are worse things at sea, and at least he wasn't a fat man.  The album blended hard-hitting rock with exotic sounds performed with mandolins, balalaikas, and tablas. Bluesy passages, then I was transported to old India. An echoey resonance, like the sounds in a woods after a rain shower, gave a sylvan sheen to the music.  Truly wondrous were the ringing guitar chords of baby-faced Martin Barre, the rolling bass of headbanded Glenn Cornick, and the thundrous drums of tough Clive Bunker.  I played &#34;Stand Up&#34; repeatedly through that stormy night, and a true Jethro Tull fan was forged amidst mighty thunder and lightning!  FORTY-ONE years later, I am enjoying this deluxe edition of &#34;Stand Up,&#34; with plenty of additional early Tull tracks, plus a 11-04-70 Carnegie Hall, N.Y.C., Tull concert both on a CD, and on an unedited DVD-audio version.  The longer version is worth hearing for Ian's outlandish between-songs chatter.  He describes the disgusting uncleanliness of the harmonica from the pocket of his checkered frock-coat, the hardened drippings of which get eagerly chewed by new keyboardist John Evan.  Ian also speaks of his old mate Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond, who would later be replacing Glenn Cornick on bass.  Ian describes Jeffrey as a shy person &#34;who people laugh at and make fun of...he even tried to commit suicide!&#34;  When Jeffrey did join, we already felt like we knew him, thanks to Ian's kind remarks!  The DVD also has a 2010 visual/audio &#34;interview&#34; with Ian Anderson, who doesn't need questions to reminisce about the creation and recording of &#34;Stand Up,&#34; one of his favorite Tull albums. I was struck by the sight of his big hands and long fingers, which undoubtedly aid in playing the guitar and flute.  Ian wastes his breath comparing the similarities of his song &#34;We Used to Know&#34; to the Eagles' later &#34;Hotel California,&#34; modestly calling the Eagles song &#34;much better.&#34; He also compares the rough energy of early Jethro Tull to the &#34;Seattle sound&#34; of Nirvana and Pearl Jam twenty years later.  Ian seems very much the &#34;elder statesman of rock and mandolins.&#34;  Will they please get Jethro Tull into the Rock Hall of Fame &#34;before the Man says it's time to go&#34;?!

B003UESJH4|4.0|The story opens in 1925, as the Duke of York (aka \\"Bertie\\" to his family), played by Colin Firth,  is about to give a  speech.  It's torture for him, as he is shy and is nearly unable to speak because he stammers so badly.  Still, he takes some comfort in the fact that he'll never have to be King since he has an older brother, the playboy prince known as \\"David.\\"  Bertie's beloved wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) engages the services of an elocution therapist and Bertie grudgingly starts classes, but the teacher (Geoffrey Rush) has some unorthodox techniques.<br /><br />This is mostly a very good movie with sympathetic characters and historical significance.  Bertie's older brother did become King, but he abdicated, forcing shy Bertie into the job.  The film leads up to Bertie's (now King George VI) very important first radio address to the nation after WWII is declared.  The era is recreated well and one feels the weight on the King's shoulders as he prepares to address his countrymen, to guide and strengthen them.  It's a moving scene as the King manages to deliver the speech nearly flawlessly with the help of his teacher.  Rush is bubbly and funny and kind, Carter is loving and supportive, and Firth is every inch a King.<br /><br />The pace was a bit slow at times and I nearly dozed off in the middle.  Also, the lighting was a problem; most indoor scenes appeared to be lit by small lamps, leaving half of the faces too pale and the other half in darkness.  There are many familiar faces in the cast and all are excellent.  Recommended, especially from an historic standpoint.

0525951652|4.0|After Ken Follet's disaterous novel World Without End,  He has redeemed himself with Fall of Giants.    Well developed characters and a well researched time period makes for an interesting read. Mr. Follet has largely abandoned his habit of using contemporary slang in a period piece.  Note to Mr. Follet, the expression \\"tucking in\\" is purely British and should be used sparingly, if at all.    After discovering Mr. Follet's atheism in his last novel, this one shows us his sympathetic view of socialism.  It may fly well in England, but probably not so well across the pond. We can hope that his socialist ideals are tempered a bit with an equal understanding of capitalism and free enterprise in the remainder of the trilogy.  We can also hope for less cartoonish representation of Americans as gangsters.    All in all, an entertaining read.  That is why we read after all, for entertainment, not for indoctrination into the personal beliefs of the author.    Four stars from me!
0060899220|5.0|Think 70s bad boy druggie who develops one redeeming feature - cooking. Bourdain's bold voice draws the reader into the foreign world of professional kitchens, complete with degrading vocabulary used amongst the essentially male workers and amazing volumes of food preparation. The lifestyle of a cook involves long hours standing in a hot kitchen with intermittent sessions of high speed cooking and hours of waiting for the prime meal times to hit. The \\"in the trenches\\" sessions range from dishwashing, cleaning drain traps, to handling food by cutting efficiently, cooking exactly the right time and temperature, seasoning as designed by the chef and repeating it all so every course looks the same night after night with no variation. He writes about how times have changed and many kitchens are much more tame and well managed than in the 1970s wild west atmosphere that drew him in to become a chef.  Highly recommended as entertaining and educational.

B003Y5H51K|1.0|Sanctum certainly seems to have a lot of potential, doesn't it? It was filmed in 3D and produced by Avatar director James Cameron. Even if you're like me and not completely sold by the TV spots and trailers, it's bound to be decent because Cameron is somewhat involved, right? Keep telling yourself that. Sanctum is probably the most disappointing theatrical experience in the first few months of the year.<br /><br />You'll probably notice how fantastic the film looks. Sanctum was obviously filmed in 3D and uses the same techniques Cameron used for Avatar, which also isn't surprising. Nearly everything seems to jump off the screen, but at the same time the film doesn't really have any standout moments where the effect is utilized in a way that really wows its audience. Most of the underwater scenes are spectacular though. Seeing those vast underwater cavities, even if they were probably mostly created in front of a green screen, is incredible. There are also several scenes where you're looking at the giant hole in the earth the main characters first enter as if you were looking down from the sky while it's raining that are really memorable because of the perspective. So at face value, Sanctum has the appearance of a good film or at least a decent one.<br /><br />Nearly everything else about the film is awful. You know things are going to go downhill once Josh mutters the line, \\"What could possibly go wrong in a cave?\\" Everyone in the film just makes terrible decisions from then on out. Remember that thing that happened last time? Let's make it a point to mention that, so it won't happen again. Sure enough, it happens again. DON'T do whatever you're thinking about doing. I know it's a drastic situation and you have to think on your toes, but you will surely die if you do what you're thinking of doing. So what does the person do? That thing they were advised not to. So guess what happens? Josh and Victoria are probably the worst of them. Josh points out the stupidest of observations. When the cave first starts to flood, he's in the team heading to the surface but decides to go back for his dad and the others still down in the cave. The cave is flooding. Water is pouring in. It's very obvious what's happening. So Josh runs in, around rocks, all out of breath and calling out to his dad. When he reaches the cave entrance, he yells out the brilliant statement that, \\"THE CAVE IS FLOODING!\\" Gee, you think? Victoria does something in the film that is incredibly stupid and you know it is right when she does it, then later looks back on it realizing she should have done what she was advised to do in the first place. Do you want to defile a dead woman's corpse or develop hypothermia and freeze to death? The answer should be obvious. The rest of the characters aren't so great either though. Josh's dad, Frank, is basically emotionless and nothing more than an Australian version of Christian Bale's Batman while Ioan Gruffudd's Carl is the typical selfish character that makes a lot of over the top decisions that never pay off.<br /><br />Throw in the lame attempts at humor and terrible dialogue and you have yourself an hour and forty nine minute groanfest. Carl mentions something about Frank's anus being so tight that a dog won't be able to hear him fart while Crazy George spews nothing but bad jokes and even worse dialogue the entire film. Developing the clap in Mexico along with advising to grow gills if your equipment goes faulty and telling someone to calm down because the \\"panic vulture sits on your shoulder\\" are all things that are memorable for all the wrong reasons.<br /><br />Some of the tight spaces traveled through while underwater were able to trigger my claustrophobia at times, but it was nothing that hadn't been done better before. Remember The Descent? Most of me was wanting Crawlers to show up and kill everyone in this horrible film after it was established that every character had been dropped on their head at some point in their childhood. The other part of me was wondering why this pushed for an R-rating. Other than a few brief moments of gore and the F-bomb being dropped a few dozen times, the film could've easily been edited down to a PG-13 rating to appeal to a wider audience. Then again, with Cameron's name slapped onto the film and the main marketing ploy, maybe a PG-13 film that mostly takes place underwater would remind too many people of Cameron's 1989 film The Abyss and make them think it was a remake or something. Well, let me tell you, this doesn't come anywhere close to even touching The Abyss.<br /><br />Sanctum is a dull, predictable, and cliche thriller with terrible dialogue, a lame attempt at humor, some of the dumbest characters to ever be included in a film, and just a rather underwhelming journey in the end. Don't go into this expecting it to be another Avatar just because Cameron is connected to the film in some way or because it was filmed in 3D. Don't even expect a good film. If you have any interest in Sanctum, I recommend waiting for the rental because it really isn't worth paying expensive movie theater ticket prices in addition to whatever you have to pay for 3D films.e was wondering why this pushed for an R-rating.

B002RVZV9K|4.0|I enjoyed this DVD, but bought it primarily because I am a U2 fan. I agree somewhat with other reviewer's notes for this product, as Jack White's portayed attitude/facial expression is abrasive by comparison and he doesn't seem to add much value to the discussion at first. However, if you watch this with an open mind and if you like his stuff already, it is decent and you can dig where he's coming from. He just comes off as a punk kid amongst rock history legends; maybe it is intended. Different music styles and generation differences might skew how one views this DVD. All said, it was worth the money, and I recommend that any fan of these guys, or rock history in general, at least watch this production once. It opened my interests enough to check out more of White's music and you can't go wrong be delving into more Led Zep! U2 will remain favorite, for me. A couple U2 gems in there, and a old video clip of U2 that I never knew existed.

B004EQAVHI|5.0|(Warning: Spoilers Below)<br /><br />The first thing to note about Never Let Me Go is how utterly realistic it is.<br /><br />In the real world, young, underpaid Chinese workers have the life sucked out of them in order to make the cheap laptop I'm typing on. Children in southern Iraq grow up with birth defects caused by the depleted uranium fired by American tanks in 1990 and then 2003 to keep the country under control so I can keep filling my car with gas. The Irish, Greek, and Icelandic people are required to make painful budget cuts so that the bankers can keeping giving one another seven figure bonuses.<br /><br />In \\"Never Let Me Go\\" an entire exploited race of young people are brought up for the sole purpose of harvesting their organs. It's the perfect narrative distillation of the exploitive, near vampirelike nature of late capitalism.<br /><br />Here's the film's brilliant twist. While the Chinese, Mexican, or Iraqi poor would be unlikely to elicit the sympathy of a lot of rich Americans, the exploited race in Never Let Me Go is made up entirely of good looking, blond, white Anglo Saxons (although almost certainly not Protestants) who go to an expensive boarding school. Outwardly they're privileged, well-dressed, well-fed, and superficially well-educated. Except for one heartbreaking primal scream near the end of the film, they never rebel against their fate. They never cause any trouble. They don't take drugs, kill one another, fight, adopt violent religious fundamentalism, or do anything that most of the world's exploited people do. The exploiters, the \\"normal\\" people, on the other hand, look like mundane, everyday British citizens.<br /><br />The impossibly beautiful Carey Mulligan, who looks as if she just stepped out of a painting by Leonardo or Botticelli, plays Cathy H, and her role is to be a \\"carer.\\" What she really is is a Kapo,  a condemned prisoner who gets to live a little longer in exchange for helping run the extermination camp. Her two best friends, played by Andrew Garfield and Keira Knightly have been engaged in a \\"long term\\" love affair, as long as it can be under their circumstances, even though Garfield's character and Cathy H are genuine soulmates. The only hope any of them have is \\"deferral,\\" the idea that if any two of them can prove that they're genuinely in love, they can live a few years longer together. The way, they imagine, that they can prove it is by creating art, something that reveals their souls.<br /><br />Deferral, in the end, is an illusion, and this, in turn, makes the fate of the doomed young people in Never Let Me Go crueler than the fate of any Jew in the Holocaust. In Roman Polanski's film \\"The Pianist,\\" Wadysaw Szpilman saves his life by playing Chopin for a Nazi officer. The Nazi, seeing that Szpilman has a soul, brings him food and shelters him. No such mercy is found in the world of \\"Never Let Me Go.\\" No work of art can reach people who govern the lives of the doomed, young protagonists. They are cold, utterly logical, and terrifyingly polite vampires.d Keira Knightly have been engaged in a \\"long term\\" love affair, as long as it can be under their circumstances, even though Garfield's character and Cathy H are genuine soulmates.

B003L20IFQ|5.0|obviously there are movies that some rave about and others can't stand (matrix was that movie for me..  I *hated* the matrix, the plot was an overused remix of other movies, and good lord keanu reeves has the dramatic range of a chicken.  no, earth worm.  no, rock.. but I digress...).  Then there are those loved by only a small few.<br /><br />Bottom line, this movie required some very creative directing, writing, acting and lighting.  To make a movie that takes place entirely inside of a coffin is an ambitious venture.  Here it is quite well done.  Just when you think where else can they go with this, they come up with some other plot device to move things along.<br /><br />the \\"political message\\" here is anything but..  Wall-E had more of a overt message to send (which was disappointing as I had high hopes for that movie).<br /><br />** warning: spoiler alert **<br /><br />as history has shown us, people can't stand movies that don't have happy endings.  boo hoo, go watch it's a wonderful life.  i guarantee you if this movie had ended on more of a positive note, it would've gotten more favorable reviews.<br /><br />this movie is definitely outside of the mainstream romcom action adventure horror BS that we're all subjected to day in and day out from hollywood.  truly unique story lines are hard to find.  while the notion of being buried alive isn't a new one, and this movie certainly causes one to reflect back to tom hanks with his volleyball on the island, it is unique and enjoyable through and through.<br /><br />oh, and thank god it was a snake and not a spider, I did appreciate that.  I repeat, snake good, spider bad.

0060989157|5.0|I'm a big M&ouml;tley Cr&uuml;e fan. In fact, watching the Looks that Kill video on MTV back in 1984 turned this average football loving eleven year old into a crazed headbanger and sent me on a lifelong quest for the loudest, heaviest, hardest hitting music possible.<br />So, fitting squarely in the target group this book's aiming for, I really doubt that I can write a fair, impartial assessment of the book.<br />For heshers like me, who grew up rocking endlessly to tunes like Looks That Kill, Shout at the Devil, Red Hot, Too Young to Fall in Love, Bastard, Ten Seconds to Love, Wild Side, Girls, Girls, Girls, and ...All in the Name Of yet still have a soft spot in their hearts for a schmaltzy power ballad like Home Sweet home, this book is like a dream come true.<br />The astonishing rise of the band, from local LA glam metal misfits to worldwide hard rock juggernaut is told both with graphic detail and candid detachment, keeping the narrative flowing and the reader hooked with these lecherous lunkheads' exploits, while their failings as human beings and subsequent fall from grace are dealt with a brutally honest style. The story is told by multiple narrators, most of the time the band members adding some important collaborators here and there. Even if this technique might bring contradicting versions on some incidents, it makes for a truly interesting and entertaining read.<br />This book is not for the squeamish. Much like Led Zeppelin, Queen and Van Halen before them and Guns 'n Roses after them, the Cr&uuml;e built a bad boy reputation based on their sexually decadent behavior and drug excesses, but unlike the aforementioned bands, their music didn't prove to be strong enough on the long run to stand on it's own outside the band's image.<br />That said, Neil Strauss manages to weave the story in a way that it ultimately becomes a tale that anybody can identify with: a scarcely talented yet very driven group of misfits pay their dues and achieve their dreams of rock 'n roll stardom, succeeding despite their life threatening drug and alcohol addictions yet ultimately loosing it all to their own hubris and fighting to rise from their own ashes.<br />Yes folks, this is the formula both for a Greek tragedy and a Behind the Music special, and that's the main reason this book works so well regardless if the reader is interested in the band or not.<br />For big fans of the band like me, this book delivers most of the dirty details we already knew and delivers a few we missed over the years.<br />I mean, before reading the book I already knew that Vince Neil's a selfish alcoholic bum who's only in it for the girls and the money, that Nikki Sixx's an immature drug addict incapable of confronting his problems who will always blaming his failings on childhood issues and that Tommy Lee is little more than a stupid and violent manchild, but on the other hand, I didn't know about Mick's health or personal issues and was shocked about how much his fellow band members kicked him around over the years.<br />During its 80s heyday, fans perceived the band as an airtight unit, an unlikely yet unbreakable brotherhood of wild, unpredictable rock misfits united by music, tragedy and success. True, with Vince Neil's sacking in 1992, this perception began to crumble, but the author doesn't pull any punches at exposing the band's feuding and backstabbing, proving that said brotherhood was nothing but a carefully cultivated image.<br />One interesting point the book doesn't address is Mick's real age: despite the claim that he's about five years older than the other guys, there's a persisting rumor among hardcore Cr&uuml;e fans that he was actually in his early forties when the band fame's exploded, which doesn't seem that implausible after all if you look at old band photos.<br />In the end, The Dirt is that rare rock biopic that not only delivers all the sordid details the band's fandom expect, but also manages to build an engaging human intereststory that can appeal to anyone interested in rock music.story that can appeal to anyone interested in rock music.

B00003CXCT|5.0|Never ever can you go wrong with the Original Trilogy (save the stupid little GameBoy game). Even now, thirty-four years after A New Hope's release, thiry-one years after The Empire Strikes Back's and twenty-eight years after Return of the Jedi's. Some people complain about the special editions, but these same people will go out and ignore the regular version of a movie just to buy the Director's Cut.    What's the real difference?    So Lucas didn't direct Empire and only directed second unit on Jedi - he created the Star Wars universe. It's his to play with.    Enough about that and onto the DVDs themselves. I personally chose the four-disc set (from 2004) over the six-disc, Limited Edition version (from '06) because I don't need the originals. There's gotta be a billion places on the internet I can find them, and I just want to enjoy what is considered the \\"current\\" version (by Lucasfilm). Don't get me wrong, though, I too don't like that Hayden Christensen was superimposed over the origial Anakin Skywalker, but that one minor detail isn't gonna stop me from watching the movie, neither are the oddly screwed up lightsaber colors or Ian McDarmaid in Empire (this change I like the most, actually).    Plus, I love the bonus disc. It has one of my two favorite Star Wars documentaries (Empire of Dreams).    All-in-all, whichever set you choose is your preference (and later this year, we've got the Blu-Ray set coming), so I'm not gonna just yell at you and say \\"buy this set, dammit!\\", and all I really can say is \\"make up your mind\\".

I have seen the notebook and just assumed the movies of his books would be better than the books themselves, but I was wrong. The book Dear John blew the movie out of the water. I read this book before the movie and when I  saw the movie I was disappointed for sure.  The way the book portrayed the love between the two characters was beautiful. I also enjoyed how Nicholas Sparks chose the ending. The books plot was romantic, but wasn't always light hearted. The reason I enjoyed this book was because of the way it was written. It was in Johns point of view and it showed every emotion and hardship. The book brought me to tears and I would recommend it for sure! I would read this book again and again, so if you are interested in a good romantic read then this is the book for you! It was AMAZING!

1600242405|5.0|I don't usually recommend the audio over the printed version of a book, but an exception must be made in this case.  The full power of this memoir is expressed through Johnny Depp's amazing range of character and through Keith Richards' warmth and humor.  For example, the inevitable breakup with Anita Pallenberg after decades of mutually self destructive behavior is amazingly touching, a fact that the printed word could not possibly convey.  There is more than just rock band gossip here.  The roots of the band, their amazing musicianship, their reverence for blues of all kinds and how they could adapt the sound, not to mention their continued fascination after almost 50 years.  Here is a musician truly in love with his profession who is not afraid to present himself warts and all, who comes out the other side as remarkably kind, brilliant and generous.  The reading is so fluid that I'd reach the end of a disc surprised that so much time had elapsed.  Not since Jim Dale's recordings of the Harry Potter books have I enjoyed an audio book so much.

This book is wonderfully written and entertaining from beginning to the end!  The story centers around Katniss who volunteers to take her sister's place in the Hunger Games which are vicious fight to the death games.  The story also focuses on the growing relationship between Katniss and her opponent Peeta.  I must admit the book is a little violent and gory for the target age range, but it's still a great read!

B002QFYJF4|3.0|I had never seen Magnolia before, but I couldn't resist the Amazon sale price so I thought I'd check it out. Let me start by saying that the blu-ray is great. The picture and audio leave little to be desired. There is minimal film grain, and the colors are clear and crisp. I am not an audio aficionado, but the audio sounded fine coming out of the built in speakers on my HDTV. There are multiple supplemental features including a feature length documentary on the film. The packaging is the standard blu-ray case, the \\"recycled case\\" for anyone who cares about that sort of thing. Overall, the product itself has no problems. The film though, is a different story.<br /><br />While I enjoyed parts of the film, its not something I will probably care to watch again. From a visual standpoint, the film is well made. Additionally, the story-line is original and intriguing. Unfortunately neither of these delights can save the film from the boring and unlikable characters. The vast majority of the characters are so unlikeable, one-dimensional or neurotic, that its difficult to care what happens. I understand that this film aims for a more realistic approach towards the characters, they all have real problems and are not romanticized in the way most Hollywood movies tend to do, but  John C. Reilly and the young boy seemed to be the only characters worth caring about. While there are many films where we like the characters because they're so unlikable, here its less about the characters being unlikeable as it is them being flat or tiresome. At the end of the movie, everyone supposably has an awakening experience, but its hard to believe that any of these characters have actually learned anything and will change their lives for the better. If the movie extended for another hour, which with a running time of over three hours it thankfully does not, I think we would see that most of the characters would be just as miserable and confused as they were at the beginning of the film. Of course there are many themes in this movies concerning love and regret, but its difficult for the audience to appreciate these themes if we don't believe that the characters have actually changed. And as far as the \\"raining frogs\\" scene, it did not affect my view of the movie one way or the other. For anyone wondering though, the scene does not play out like a surreal event with frogs floating down from a cloudy blue sky. This is how the back of the case portrays it, but the frogs actually fall out of the darkness like huge balls of hail, splattering on the sidewalk and shattering windows. Let me reiterate though, this scene did not \\"ruin\\" the movie for me and actually might have been something that I would have greatly enjoyed if it had occurred in a different movie with more authentic characters.<br /><br />The blu-ray itself works great, but the sad fact remains that in spite of the film's interesting set-up and potential to enrapture some viewers, it was impossible for me empathize or identify with any of the characters. This might not be a problem for some films, but for a film that sets itself up as a vast web of intertwining character studies, the whole experience may leave some viewers feeling the way I did, hollow and indifferent.<br /><br />EDIT: 4/8 I just traded my copy in for an Amazon gift card. Ultimately I decided that although its not a completely terrible film, it wasn't really worth owning.re are many themes in this movies concerning love and regret, but its difficult for the audience to appreciate these themes if we don't believe that the characters have actually changed.

1847879071|5.0|I am a first-year PhD student in social work, and had my first ever stats course last semester. It was incredibly difficult for me, just because the concepts were completely new to me. I hated the book, Andy Field, his examples, and his humor. Sometimes I felt like hitting him with this book. In order not to fail the class, I spent long hours reading the book. I read it everywhere - train, bus, home, night, morning, laundry-room - and gradually it started to click in my head. I loved the book eventually, as Andy Field guided me carefully from one concept to another, from one type of test to another. I love this book. I am taking a regression class this semester, and still, refer to Andy Field's book for examples and explanations. I can't help but mention that Andy Field is a young, cool, and cute English man.

Those who like shows like \\"Scrubs\\" and \\"The Office\\" will also love Community! Being coupled with \\"The Office\\" makes Thursday Nights on NBC THE best night on TV! Best of all, the diverse cast makes the show enjoyable and relatable to all ages. Not just worth renting, but worth owning outright!<br /><br />The ONLY thing I can say dissapointed me was that there should've been more bonus features (I don't listen to commentaries too much.) Oh, and also the sadness you feel when you get to the last episode of the season. Thank goodness for Hulu putting up Season 2!
B004DMAZQK|3.0|I didn't like this album near as much as I hoped I would. I don't say this from the point of view as someone that just heard  White Lies for the first time, I say it from the point of being an adoring fan. I loved \\"to Loose my Life.\\" I loved it song, to song, to song and nothing could have stopped me from buying this follow up. But whatever that curse is that claims the quality of second tries, is (to some degree) evident here. I'm not saying its a bad album, because its not. I'm not saying if you like white lies that you shouldn't buy it, I'm not. I'm just saying that whatever magic that the first album had that I personally loved so much, somehow teeters in and out of this one. Sometimes its there, and sometimes its hard to find. I can't say what it is or what makes one song better than another but I have definite favorites on this album where the last it was impossible to say such a thing.     Perhaps I am a victim of my own hopes, but I can't help feeling that if I had heard this album first, that I never would have moved onto \\"to loose my life.\\" If that is how things had happened I would have missed out on one of my all time favorite albums of which I would give five gushing stars to.     At times I wonder if it was rushed in any way. A couple of songs sound fantastic , but much sounds like filler which did not exist on their last offering. If this was the case then I say take  more time, as much time as they need. If it took two years take three. If it's four years to make it right, then that is fine with me. Second CD slumps only end in two ways that I have experienced, they recapture lost triumph, or they continue to get sucked into a hole of mediocrity. For the love White Lies don't go there. I cant watch such a thing happen to a great band. It would break my heart.
B0036EH3WK|4.0|This is definitely one of the most comprehensive complete collections I've seen. Extras are aplenty, picture is crisp and the audio excellent. The package is also sturdy and nice to look at, if a little hard to place anywhere.    Only thing that forces me to give this four stars instead of five is the fact they didn't bother to make the seasons 3 and 4 region-free. So anyone who still can't resist to buy this have to buy those seasons individually and put the discs into this one.

I just couldn't put it down. It was very informative and easy to follow.

1594744475|4.0|As someone who's always been interested in not only preparing delicious and healthy meals but also presenting them beautifully, I was delighted to come across the idea of obento.  I'm so looking forward to trying these ideas out for my little girl!    The book is very informative about the concept of \\"eating with your eyes\\" before you eat your meal, and also discusses the proportional nutrition of veg to starch to protein to fruit/sweets that is aimed for in the bento lunch concept.  The sample pictures are oh-my-goodness adorable and extremely creative and instructions for each idea, as well as where to find extra materials (egg shapers, food picks, etc.) and cheaper but serviceable alternatives (hole punches, toothpicks, etc.) are clearly written.  All concepts are defined and all recipes are clearly written - these ideas will take a bit of time to prepare, but are not at a difficulty level to make them something most people couldn't take on.    Personally I think this book will be just for ideas and instruction.  The recipes were small portions (not practical in my household) and all but a few included meat (also not happening in my household).  No big deal because they didn't write it to be a family-sized meal or vegetarian cookbook so I can't fault them for either.  Just mentioning it as a heads-up to others who might be in the same situation (vegetarian and/or too busy to cook a tiny separate meal instead of simply including a portion of the whole family's larger meal).    The only critique I have of the book is one that another reviewer mentioned and that is the repetitiveness.  For as adorable as the obento features in each recipe are, all are made of either egg, rice, lunch meat, hot dogs, or sliced cheese.  Most of the facial features are made of nori.  Again, I like the overall concepts and instructions but especially for a book that is supposedly super health-concsious, I was surprised at overprocessed foods being such staple ingredients and for my own creations plan to improvise with lower salt, nitrate, food coloring, and fat content items.  There were some tiny decorative veg garnishes, but there weren't any recipes that didn't use the above mentioned items as the main part.  The eggs & rice are healthy things, I just note them because it seemed like a repetitive use of ingredients, but even so was also glad to see a variety of options for shaping and presentation.    I love reading this book and would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in getting the basics of really cute obento theory and presentation.
B0000DZ3EA|5.0|This collection by Peter Gabriel is definitely a collection full of great hits.  Some of my personal favorite songs included in this greatest hits cd set are:<br />Solsbury Hill<br />Shock the Monkey<br />Sledgehammer<br />Games Without Frontiers<br />Digging in the Dirt<br />Steam<br />Lovetown<br /><br />  My overall favorite song is \\"Sledgehammer\\" because he cleverly phrases the lyrics in a way to express what he plans to be to his lover in a tasteful and unique manner. \\"Games Without Frontiers\\" came in as my second most favorite Peter Gabriel song because he expresses great talent in making a political message in how idealogies between different countries can sometimes cause a challenge in diplomatic relations.  I also like how he wisely sings the lyrics in the song \\"Dressing Up in Costumes, Playing Silly Games\\".  I also believe that the song sends a thoughtful and positive message about looking past the external appearance of someone and instead making a open-minded observation based on what is picked up from their personality and spirit. The greatest hits collection is a high-quality and strong cd set that is a good collection to have if you enjoy 80's music, Phil Collins, Genesis, pop music, and/or rock music.
B004L3AR0K|1.0|Love & Other Drugs is a miserable, long, annoying exercise in patience. Much like Eat, Pray, Love, this film takes unlikable characters and have them say miserable things to one another and then the movie ends. Unlike EPL, this film doesn't even have the nice scenery to make it mildly diverting - unless you count quite a few segments of nudity as scenery. Why this story was even made into a movie is beyond me, and I would highly suggest avoiding it.  It's obviously another bad adaption of a book.<br /><br />Jamie (Jake Gyllenhaal), a pharmaceutical sales rep meets Maggie (Anne Hathaway), a cynical woman with medical issues. They begin a relationship of sorts that is anything but conventional. This movie is based on a true story, but after doing some research online, I've found that the film is very very very loosely based on actual events. That's not a surprise as so much of the story felt over-the-top and ridiculous. The acting is very good - but the two leads cannot save a script that has them both be unlikable and unrealistic. There is a plot line about a new job, Viagra, and the state of the country's healthcare system, but they don't really impact the story overall.<br /><br />While the film is under two hours, it felt much longer. At about twenty minutes in, I lost interest. It's so dull it's almost a crime. There isn't a whole lot more to say, other than I highly suggest passing on this waste. It's important to know that this is not a comedy like the marketing may suggest. Avoid this movie.
031219126X|4.0|This is a great version of the book!  I love the different perspectives that are listed behind the novel.  Good buy.
B000LXHK2C|1.0|This movie version of \\"A Good Year\\" was absolutely awful; it was nothing like the book, which was wonderful. This movie version struck me as trying to pass off the Keystone cops as a work of art. I wish that I had not wasted my money on it. Peter Mayle is an excellent writer who can tell engaging and charming stories. Do not judge him by this movie. James
B002VKE1K2|1.0|I liked Blair Witch.  This was not as good and is kind of a cross between that and The Ring (which I also liked).  After the initial plotline is set up, the middle just sags and drags on through.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book was so interesting and completely different from anything I've ever read. I read it extremely quickly - cover to cover. The author made the story come to life. DEFINITELY read this. It's at easy read because it's from the view of a 5 year old, but don't think that this makes it a childish book.
B002T9H2MO|2.0|For much of the movie the main character is hallucinating, which isn't particularly interesting to watch, more like a waste of time.  In the end there were some interesting plot twists but not enough for me to recommend.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this series and although this is a loaned copy, I fully intend to buy it one day.<br /><br />I have read a few of the negative reviews and though I agree that this book was slower reading than the previous two (I actually managed to put it down long enough to sleep and eat), I still think it was worth five stars.<br /><br />One of the most common complaints I read in these reviews is that Katniss fails to become a respected leader and that is disappointing. Ironically, I thought we were meant to realize this all along. She was never leader material and that, ironically, was what made her such a symbol to the common people. She was never a leader because she never lied to herself. She always knew that she was a mere puppet. Her main act of defiance was always to choose who pulled her strings, not to actually pull her own. She herself was never genuinely a leader- Haymitch was her strategist, Peeta her charisma, Gale her strength, Prim her motivation. She was just a very good puppet and knew how to take orders but she always knew that too!<br /><br />I also read that the ending wasnt happy enough for YA literature and would be acceptable for Nineteen Eighty-Four but not this. If this series is classified as YA Lit, the classification is incorrect. The Hunger Games is as much YA because the main characters are teens as Famil Guy is a kids cartoon because Stewie is a baby. This series is DARK! That is why I am happy there was no happy ending that glossed over reality. Anyone who knows someone who lived through the horrors of fighting in a war or survived 9/11 knows that it irreversibly changes people. Katniss was forced from her hungry but happy existence into several of these horrific experiences with no one to really support her cuz they were all too messed up themselves. Personally I think she did well for herself.<br /><br />Finally, while I know what happened to Gale and appreciate the little epilogue, I did feel a litle cheated and rushed at the end there. No enough to bring down the rating though. And honestly, since I don't see this as YA lit, I feel no need to be spoon fed what happened or a neat little Happily Ever After.<br /><br />(As an aside, Cinna, Haymitch and Peeta were my favourite characters though I sorta liked Buttercup too ;) hehe)own the rating though. And honestly, since I don't see this as YA lit, I feel no need to be spoon fed what happened or a neat little Happily Ever After.

B0042MEQVG|5.0|This is the only movie of the three now available that I have reviewed of the Twilight Saga.  The first two movies were just okay but Eclipse really satisfied me and made me want to watch it twice.  So I did.  I enjoyed it even more the second time around.  The cast seemed more mature and worked better together.  The storyline was more exciting and I got used to the silly looking CGI wolves.  The interaction between Jacob, Bella and Edward was more believable and satisfying.  It was a fun, fun movie.  My only complaint is a question.  What the heck happened to Esme?  Her makeup and hair color were completely the opposite of all the other movies and for the longest time I thought they had used a different actress.  Why can't the directors of these movies keep a consistent look with the actors and the scenery?
B00005N6KG|5.0|I finally found a pair of headphones that won't fall out of my ears when I run! They worked so well that I set new personal bests for time and distance!  I've tried to run with my Bose ear buds (that rest in your ear), Koss ear buds, and a set of JVC over-the-ear ear buds that I bought 2 weeks ago. They all have the same problem. After about 10 minutes of running I start working up a good sweat, and once your ear gets sweaty, there's no way that an ear bud will stay in place, especially with the constant impact from running. They just start to slip out, and there isn't anything you can do to fix the problem. Having to constantly adjust a headphone of any kind while running is a major distraction, and totally takes my focus off my workout.  For under $10, the Sony MDR-W08L was a risk-free shot at solving the problem. I had a similar pair of Sony headphones about 15 years ago that had an exposed metal headband. They worked well, but the sound was marginal. That was long before I took up running. These headphones very similar, but much more stylish and with much better sound. Are they perfect? No. They don't have as much spring to the headband as I expected, but I found that once I got them adjusted for my head/ears they stayed in place. I had to adjust the bass up a bit and keep the high end flat on my MP3 player to keep them from sounding too tinny.   Once I got everything set for fit and sound, I was off and running. They didn't slide out, fall off, or require constant adjustment! I'm sooooooo glad I bought two pairs!  11/20/2011 UPDATE - my first pair finally broke. They lasted ten months with daily use since my wife started using them, too. Sometimes used twice a day. One of the wires finally pulled loose after accidentally yanking the cord and/or stressing the cord from dropping an attached MP3 player. $8 for ten months of daily use? AWESOME. I still have the 2nd pair that I use, and just ordered 4 more pairs for around $30 just in case Sony decides to stop making them.  BTW, when they get full of sweat, use a paper towel to wick away as much of the sweat as possible, then use an air duster to gently blow the rest of the moisture our of the earpieces. Heavy sweating from exercise usually contains a fair amount of sodium leaching out through your pores. Even though you can't see them with the naked eye, there are sodium crystals in that sweat that can eventually cause damage to the earpiece drivers as the sweat dries and the crystals harden. Unfortunately, the manufacturers don't tell you how to \\"maintain\\" the earpieces because they'd rather sell you another pair once the drivers start failing due to the sweat/sodium crystal damage.
4770031246|5.0|I was fortunate to meet the author at a book signing in Seattle, she was such a lovely and friendly person. But the book! Love the photos, love how simple and quick the recipes are, love how they use easy to acquire ingredients (for me at least). Even if you're not into Asian cuisine you can use these ideas with Western food.
B0015DROBO|1.0|I'll make this review short (being over 2 thousand reviews). Like many, I found the title intriguing, the reviews and comments amazing (NOT!), and not to mention the draw of a female heroine. I read the entire series and to put it bluntly - THIS IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. The books are filled with a list of many (if not too many) complex characters (foreign names and places), political/business terms and issues, and not to mention the historical details that are forced onto the reader to intertwine it with the rest of the story in order for it to MAKE SENSE. THIS BOOK IS COMPLICATED AND VERY HARD TO READ (i had to read the first book twice to understand what was going on).<br />PS. I get the amazing reviews and comments, but I think you need to have the mind of a serious reader and a mind of steel to really comprehend this book. And I just HAVE to say this, the title \\" The Girl Who...\\" is total nonsense. A great title, yes. But has only a string of relation to the story, being that Salander has a dragon tattoo, which had absolutely no relation throughout the entire series.
6300216403|2.0|I feel this movie was a waste of money after reading the book. If the titles were hidden, I would never have known the book, (\\"Addie Pray\\") was related to the movie. The novel deserves 10 gold stars.<br />  Since I have received bad comments about my half baked review here- I determined to edit & expand.<br /><br /> Forthwith:<br />  I read the book first and this movie seemed like a different story. The author kept your interest with telling it in such detail you felt you were right there with all the people, seeing it all unfold first hand. I assumed the movie might be the same. Wrong. The movie, to me, was a dragged out version of only about 3 of the book's chapters. The plot was almost totally different and the ending in the movie was just as blah as the rest of it.<br />  If you want a good action packed book, this one is IT. The movie was just not the same... seemed dull and \\"Meh..\\" Very disappointing because I really liked Ryan & Tatum O'Neal, and the acting, but the story was only half there, compared to the Book, \\"Addie Pray\\" by Joe David Brown.
B001TKK3O8|2.0|Alright, here's the deal. Those of you who are entirely ignorant of the law will enjoy this film (assuming you like suspense, criminal dramas, etc.). Hopkins, especially, is brilliant.    That being said, anybody with a legal background (at least a decent one) will be able to drive trucks through the blatant holes in this film.    Without revealing spoilers, most notably, the climax of the film is entirely wrong. The legal doctrine cited does not work that way.    This is all probably pointless, as most lawyers I know stay away from legal shows and movies for precisely this reason, but worth mentioning nonetheless. It's easier to overlook a minor plot point in which the law is distorted...much more difficult to overlook the climax.    For (decent) lawyers: 1 star  For those without a legal background (and who don't care): 3 or 4 stars...it's well acted and in an alternate universe without American legal doctrines to stand in the way, the plot is engaging.
030746363X|4.0|Great book, loads of information on how to make a lifestyle change. As an RN I don't see much about this book that goes against modern medicine. Thanks Tim for doing the hard work so we have a short and concise way to make a change in your life. My only complaint, but I know why Tim left this out of his book, was the somewhat incomplete information (specifically about the slow carb diet) that left me with some questions. Hope everyone finds the book helps them as much as it helped me. Cheers!
B002HWRYJE|1.0|A little background: I'm not a trekkie or a trekker, but I have enjoyed the franchise on a casual basis in most of its incarnations (Voyager aside).    My expectations going into this film were two-fold: 1. as a \\"Star Trek\\" movie I expected it to fail miserably, but 2. as a generic action movie I expected it to pretty good. In other words, I was willing to put aside everything I knew about Star Trek and just \\"enjoy the ride\\". I was right on the first count and painfully wrong on the second count.    I'm all for suspension of disbelief, but this film pushes the limits on every count. Not only must you suspend any knowledge you have of the Star Trek universe, but also you must suspend any knowledge you have of the world and all the rules of logic. Assuming that you're able to do that, you're rewarded with: a generic and utterly forgettable action film.    I'm not going to dwell on \\"Trek lore\\" inconsistencies. I will, however, point out a few complete and total insults to logic.     WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW    --It seems that in J.J. Abrams' version of Star Trek, there is no such thing as a chain of command. In the opening sequence, George Kirk  (Jim's father) is put in command of a starship. George, we later learn, was merely a lieutenant at the time. That would suggest that aside from the captain, nobody else on board held the rank of lieutenant commander or commander. Ok, unlikely, but I'll buy it. Flash forward to the Enterprise. Spock is relieved of command and command of the ship passes to the next highest ranking officer, right? Not so much. Inexplicably passing over every officer on board, James T. Kirk, a cadet on academic suspension, is elevated to command without so much as a peep from a single officer on board outranking him.    --In J.J. Abrams' version of Star Trek, black holes let you travel through time. Sure, why not? Look, I realize that any time travel is fanciful, but I at least prefer not to be insulted. Invent some sort of plot device, explain it quickly and be on your way. I'm willing to suspend disbelief, it's much harder when you insult me in the process.    --Speaking of plot devices: red matter. Red matter can create black holes. What is red matter? Drektath's dictionary defines it as: a convenient plot device with no exposition offered. Where does it come from? Multiple theories abound, among them: it's a byproduct of J.J. Abrams' waste system. Again, I'm willing to suspend disbelief, make up some techno-babble for crying out loud.    --Starfleet apparently has no problems in dealing with mutinous crew members. In J.J. Abrams' world, they just stick them in an escape pod and jettison them into space. A shame they couldn't afford a brig in Abrams' world, I suppose.    Bottom line: groan-worthy attempts at humor, lots of lens flares, a forgettable and uninspired plot, and a series of forgettable space action sequences. Abrams stated that he was more interested in making a Star Wars movie than a Star Trek movie...shame he decided to emulate the Star Wars prequels rather than any of the good films.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Once I got through the first part of the book, I couldn't put it down.  I usually steer clear of mystery and thrillers due to the fact that I get anxious after reading them.  However, the whole trilogy was a perfect mix of love, mystery, and the underdog.  A great series overall.
B004DF3S7A|5.0|This is another great release of the Great American Songbook Series. If someone has not heard the others, this is a good way to sample the various styles of the five previous alblums. Mostly, there is such great real music from some very talented musicians with new arrangments but still having the feel of the originals. Check out the credits on who played on these tracks. They have introduced a new generation to the great standards that were such an important parts of the 20th Century. In the future students of music will study these recordings and be entertained with the best of our current times. Each of the Songbooks has a style of its own, yet all are very good. That is not common . This sampler doesn't have room on one disc for all of my favorites but that's why I bought all of the others.  If the previous review was accurate, and other recordings are forthcoming with additional themes, great. The world needs more great music to sooth our frayed nerves of these hostile times. Great , well produced , well performed music has a large audience.
B003EYVXUU|5.0|My review is going to be rather disorganized only because this movie is so different from most movies I've seen. \\"Let Me In\\" left me speechless. After seeing the trailer and hearing so much negative buzz about how it was just a simple American remake of a breathtaking foreign film, I wasn't too excited to see this one. In fact, it was only by chance that I ended up with a Blu-Ray copy in my hands. I'd originally tried to watch the original several times, and have only made it all the way through once... I wasn't impressed. I didn't see the hype. I might not have had the patience, or something, but I typically have quite good taste in movies and watch hundreds of good movies, foreign and Hollywood, every year.    Let me just sum up Let Me In using a few choice, but exquisitely fitting words:   Atmospheric... dark... intense... ambient... even nostalgic at times... Endearing... Entrancing... boundary-free.    The soundtrack was perfect. Extremely intense and sad, but soft enough to accentuate the movie itself.    The cinematography was also indescribably good. Greig Fraser's skill was impressive. It could not have been shot any better, and the actual diversity of the camera shots should be appreciated as much as the seamlessness with which they're used. This movie is also much darker than the original. MUCH darker. Everything about it emphasizes this difference, from the facial expressions to the events with \\"The Father\\".    Many criticize Let Me In's similarity to the Swedish original, but I can't help but disagree. While some scenes are very similar, they remain completely different. Let Me In actually stays more faithful to the book than the Swedish version, and even when the scenes are, dialogue-wise, identical, the acting and the all-around ambiance are incomparable.     I can't put into words how much this movie pulled at my heartstrings and touched me. I'm 16 years old now. Even though I've never thought much of McPhee as an actor, the quality he brought to hisrole as Owen was unbeatable. He reminded me of... me. I'm sure there's some part of every guy that can relate to Owen, and part of every female viewer that relates to someone like him... I was a shrimp when I was 12; I was treated like an insect. I would have given anything to simply be protected, and to have someone like Abby in my life; god knows I didn't have the confidence to make friends with much of anyone when I was Owen's age. I'm a 6'5\\" rugby player now, but I still feel like that little kid sometimes.    In a nutshell, this movie sends me back to the emotions and the intensity of loneliness and life when I was Owen's age.  The movie, all in all, has a very sad story. The ending brings good closure to it, but when you start to think deeper into how it ended, you can only think of how truly cold and lonely it would be to be Owen. I can't comment anymore on those implications so as to not give it away.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Great camera bag.  It is light weight, yet protects my photography equipment.  There is plenty of room for camera bodies and lenses, plus accessories.  This back pack has a waist strap, which I like because the weight in the bag is not carried solely by your shoulders.
B0035F0MTG|5.0|The 24 year old Chinese born Yuja Wang seems to have it all. She is a beautiful young performer who knows her repertoire and also knows how to adjust a series of works that will leave any audience satisfied.  And given those virtues so important on the road to fame, Yuja Wang is startlingly brilliant in this her second recording form DGG.  It may have been a safer idea to offer another recital of the works of one composer at this point in her career, but that would have been robbing us of a thoroughly delightful program of varying composers and Wang's 'transformation of these.<br /><br />The open works - a triptych of pieces from Stravinsky's ballet P&eacute;trouchka alone are worth buying this recording.  Wang's virtuosity is stunning - the clarity of her technique is probably unmatched on other recordings of the piano version of this music. And her interpretation doesn't stop there. Her ability to transform Stravinsky's rhythms into pianistic jewels is a feat worthy of adulation.  There is as much atmosphere in these three moments as in the ballet with full orchestra!  Wang follows these with two Scarlatti Sonatas (in E and in f minor) and her way with these challenging pieces is once again as though they came from her own creative live of thinking - crisp, elegant, probing.<br /><br />For this listener the Brahms 'Variations on a Theme by Paganini' is a complete success, not only because of her ability to present this difficult work with utter ease, but her choice to place the Brahms in between the two Scarlatti Sonatas is a stroke of programming genius.  That she adds the piano version of Ravel's 'La Valse' is a decadent pleasure: after all the clarity and purity and panache of the preceding works, basking in the sensual luxuries of this audience pleaser is better than any encore she could have selected for a recital. There are portions of this piece that Wang delivers to us in a way that makes them seem as though they have been buried since conception!<br /><br />Yuja Wang appears to be the pianist we have been waiting for - an artist able to capture her audience with excellent professionalism on every level and leave them with a sense of exaltation.  Highly recommended.

B002ZG98LO|4.0|After the disappointing reception of Aliens VS Predator, I came to the conclusion that the Predator franchise is dead in the water due to a number of factors: The PG-13 rating. Since when was the Predator franchise PG-13? It doesn't make sense since the first movie was rated R and which is an action/sci-fi classic. Then came Predator 2, which I didn't like at first but after watching it for the first time several years ago, I really enjoyed it. The less said about AVP1 and 2, the better. Now, on to the review.    I have to say that Predators is hands down the best film in the franchise. Though it's not as iconic as the first film, Predators goes back to it's roots and delivers pulse-pounding suspense and action set against an mysterious alien planet with it's own dangers and fauna and flora. The story is well-written and gives life to the characters. The irony that is so clever is that the humans are actually predators themselves with their extensive background in military but there's a nice surprise at the end of the film that I won't spoil for anyone.    With it's subtle homages to the first film and getting back to basics while going in a new direction, Predators is a blast that ranks up there right next to it's predecessor; a somewhat new perspective that AVP1 and 2 tried to do but failed miserably. But now fans can rest assured that the franchise is hack and better than ever.
B0036TGSR6|4.0|Infamous director Roman Polanski (\\"Chinatown\\") collaborated with writer Robert Harris (\\"Fatherland\\") to create 2010's most bleak, cynical thriller - a perfect movie for our cynical times.  Ewan McGregor leads a top-notch cast through the twists and turns of an interesting, atmospheric flick.    McGregor plays a quality hack writer who gets the offer of a lifetime - $250,000 to ghost write the memoirs of Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan), a former British PM in the mold of Tony Blair (well, we presume that when Tony Blair looks in a mirror, he sees Pierce Brosnan in the reflection).  Lang has left office under a cloud of scandal as his government is accused of rendering British citizens to torture-friendly countries as part of the War on Terror.  Nothing unusual in a politician having somebody with talent write his memoirs - but it is unusual that McGregor is the second writer.  The first ghost writer's body has been found in the surf near Lang's cold-yet-gorgeous beachfront mansion.    And we learn from a cantankerous local (Eli Wallach), there's no way that a body would have drifted to that spot on its own.    So we know that murder most foul has put McGregor in this spot - how will this charming hero get out of this mess?    That's it for the review - anything more will start treading into the territory of spoilers.  If you like intelligent movies with good actors, you should want to watch this one.      There's only one final point to make - this is a Roman Polanski film.  Polanski may be a despicable human being, and you can question the Hollywood morality of working with a guy with Polanksi's obvious flaws.  If you can separate your appreciation of the movie from your contempt for the man, you'll be able to enjoy the movie on its merits.  The movie's themes provide an obvious parallel to Polanski's current life of privileged exile, so it may be tough to compartmentalize your feelings for this terrible person who can make a quality film.

B0042KZJ46|5.0|I am so glad an official release of this concert is now available. Back in 1980, I scrounged some money and went to buy tickets for Bob Marley since I'd been a fan since around '73 and it was the first (and who'd know, the last) time he would play in the Pittsburgh area. The show was sold out just minutes after I got my tickets at the box office. The seats were in the last row of the last balcony in the theater. I couldn't hear the music very well from up there so I snuck down to the floor near the stage. It sounded great from that vantage point. However, the ushers caught me and told me to return to my seat. I kept going back down and kept getting sent back. Finally, they said they'd have security remove me from the theater if I didn't stay in my section.<br /><br />After waiting for years for a chance to see Marley, I walked away feeling rather aggravated about the experience. Now, finally, I can hear that concert loud and clear, as it should be. Some Marley concert recordings are better than others but they're all great. This was a transcendent experience that everyone can now enjoy in the privacy of your own abode or while cruising down the road.
B000EMGA3U|5.0|The addition of the superb live material makes this one of Sonic Youth's best albums. The musicality is more accessible than with Confusion and Bad Moon Rising but it's still Sonic Youth and it captures their Branca influence strongly. I would rate this alongside Evol, Sister, the Whitey Album, Goo and Sonic Nurse as the very best albums capturing their development. I disagree with all the critics of Edson's drumming. The music wouldn't have been the same or as good without it. I should have included NYC Ghosts and Flowers in that list but I can't stand the cover design.

B00028HBKM|5.0|If you're looking for the full, in-depth story of Christ, this is not the movie. It does, however, capture what is the greatest act of love ever performed.  For a God who needs nothing from us, to humble himself and take on our form, to resist every temptation to give us a yardstick to live by, and then to be abused for OUR transgressions and weakness is just so indebting.  I watch this not for cinematic value, but for what I believe Gibson intended for us to see, the passion that Christ had for us, that drove him to give up everything. It is a great reset button. I watch this and want less to spend my time enjoying the things of this world, but communion with him.  I hope it gives you what it gives me.  God bless.
030745455X|5.0|Playing with fire:<br /><br />In this brief review I try not to get too involved in plot details and summary, leaving it up to the reader to find them out him/herself.  Let's just say that the men who hate women also hate Salander and they really pay for their indiscretions in this book.  There are still some loose ends but I'm hoping Larsson ties them up in the third book.<br /><br />The second Larsson book is just as brilliant as the first one, even more so for several reasons.  In the first book we met a quirky but bright girl named Salander.  Then we meet a journalist bulldog named Blomkvist.<br /><br />In the second book the author ties up loose ends from the first book, creates more loose ends which (hopefully) will be tied up in the third.  In the middle we have some intense actions and interesting detective work.<br /><br />Larsson really loves criticizing authority in this novel.  The police detectives, themselves competent, have to deal with leaks and criminal mischief in their own ranks.  The two who leak info to the press have their own grudges against Salander.<br /><br />The build-up of suspense is quite slow:  We learn of Salander's adventures in the Caribbean, her return to Sweden to look up some old friends, checks up on the rapist pig that is Bjurman, who himself is trying to hire a hit-man to rub out Salandar (thanks to a damning video explained in the first book) and suddenly finds herself an interested party in a triple murder!<br /><br />Larsson's themes of corrupt journalism, lack of privacy of the individual citizen, the rampant disregard for patients from the psychiatric profession is real, is fascinating and is clearly taken from Larrson's own experiences.<br /><br />The ending of the novel wraps some things up, but Blomkvist still needs to put up with some pretty blatant stupidity on the part of the police force (there's a sneak peek at the end of the book for \\"Kicked the Hornet's Nest.\\").<br /><br />Salander is kicked, punched, shot at and left for dead and yet still manages to be a prime character in this exciting, at times plodding, yet fascinating thriller of a book.<br /><br />A must-read!<br /><br />Other Larsson Books!<br /><br />[[ASIN:0307595579 Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy Deluxe Boxed Set: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played with Fire, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, Plus On Stieg Larsson]]<br />[[ASIN:3453434064 Vergebung]]<br />[[ASIN:1844549402 The Man Who Left Too Soon: The Biography of Stieg Larsson]]racter in this exciting, at times plodding, yet fascinating thriller of a book.

1594202842|4.0|Amy Chua's little memoire on parenting is both fascinating and controversial.  I read the Time magazine article and immediately downloaded the book to the Kindle app on my iPhone.  I then read the entire book in two evenings with rapt enthusiasm, as if it were the latest Tess Gerritsen or Michael Palmer thriller.<br /><br />The fact that it is so well written, interesting, and easy to digest means it will be widely read.  Most parenting books have a limited appeal, which stunts their impact.  This book, however, will undoubtedly have a much bigger audience and a correspondingly larger influence.<br /><br />The fact that it is so provocatively written ensures it will incite debate.  The sides of the debate as defined by Ms. Chua are \\"Western\\" vs. \\"Chinese\\" ways of raising children.  As in every dialectic of thesis vs. antithesis, the truth or synthesis is somewhere in the middle as Ms. Chua partially and reluctantly concedes by the end of the book.<br /><br />What may be overlooked amidst all the hype are the many important concepts about raising successful children in a modern context that Ms. Chua highlights, sometimes inadvertently.<br /><br />First, is that affluence can be a handicap when it comes to raising kids.  This might seem counterintuitive while reading about all luxuries that Ms. Chua and her family enjoy.  However, Ms. Chua knows how intoxicating and ambition-dulling the effects of wealth can be on the children of the very successful.  This book is as much an antidote to second and third generation complacency as anything else.  It's an important concept even for those without an Ivy League pedigree.<br /><br />Second, is that hard work and discipline are essential to success.  This is true regardless of the venue.  With books like [[ASIN:0316017922 Outliers]] and [[ASIN:1933060468 Game On]] touting the magic of ten thousand hours as the key to success, who can doubt the age-old adage that \\"practice makes perfect.\\"<br /><br />Finally, is that children eventually have to take command of their own success.  The goal of parenting is not to raise large children, but independent adults.  This requires the gradual granting of autonomy.  If autonomy isn't carefully measured out, it will eventually be wrested away, or even worse never gained at all.<br /><br />The biggest mistake anyone could make after reading this book is to get too fixated on the details of Ms. Chua's child-rearing techniques.  Every parent makes mistakes.  It was brave of her to document her own for the world to read.  In most cases, the opposite of parental love is not hate, but apathy.  No one can accuse Ms. Chua of being apathetic.<br /><br />Doug Flanders, MD<br />author of  THE PRODIGY PROJECToal of parenting is not to raise large children, but independent adults.

B000N3T0DW|4.0|I saw this Spanish language film on Netflix and it had my fav bilingual actress Penelope Cruz in it, so I had to see it.  And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />\\"Volver\\" means \\"come back,\\" and who comes back and why makes for an interesting tale.<br /><br />Filmmaker Pedro Almodovar's take on female relationships is really intense and complex in this story of two sisters, how they deal with each other and how Cruz's character deals with her daughter and her abusive husband.<br /><br />OK, the abusive husband bites it most gruesomely.  It's interesting how the men in this film when they get it, they really deserve it.  But I'm not to hard on the men with Cruz so easy on the eyes, si - si.<br /><br />The film plays almost like a Spanish language novella, but Almodovar avoids much of the drama, keeps in the humor and the affection between these women.  The sisters' mother appears, who they all thought was dead.  Their dead mother, apparently from the spirit world wants to make it right with her daughters.<br /><br />A subplot of wanting to be independent, run a restaurant and even gets a bit flirtatious with a customer as Cruz sings a pretty snappy ballad, but not much is made of male-female relations here.  It's definitely \\"girls night.\\"<br /><br />The translations are fairly accurate with some English slang thrown in, which was a bit distracting to me.  I'm sure it's cultural, but the sloppy kiss-kiss on the cheeks to the point of giving hickeys was somewhat distracting!<br /><br />Overall, decent film of women, murder and love!  Check it out!<br /><br />DVD was not that special.  Special features only include commentary and previews of upcoming films.<br /><br />Other Cruz Films:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001OXLGJQ Elegy]]<br />[[ASIN:B000K7VHNW Bandidas]]<br />[[ASIN:B000FAOCC2 Don't Move]]
B00433TO52|5.0|I bought this recently because I got a Kindle for the holidays and wanted to add the classics to my library.  This kindle book is great, it has all the great Shakespearean works.  You can read them without getting a hernia because you carry all the works of Shakespeare on your little kindle.  I can highlight parts of the story I like.  I enjoy this book so much I also downloaded it my Kindle PC to read on my actual laptop.  Get it.  Today I read from the play Love Labour's Lost because it has a poem titled Winter in it which seemed appropriate since we are having a very tough winter on Long Island.  I was able to find it and highlight it on my kindle.  You could have the kindle read it to you, what fun or read it yourself. What joy! Get this kindle edition it is well worth 1.99.
0345528581|4.0|I gotta admit, I'm glad that it wasn't $15 like the retail price asks, and I was glad to get it for $10. But i assumed I should get the physical edition instead of the e-book since it would have color pictures and glossy pages. No cigar; I shoulda bought the Kindle version but I wouldn't say it's worth the $2 saved. It should be $5 instead, and then buying the ebook would make sense. I mean I can't complain that I got a book for $10, ANY book, but I expected the advantage over the digital one to be a lot better, and it's not.<br />As for the content of the book, I can't say a lot about haha. I've read the foreword, and it seems pretty credible. I'll post more when I get to that point.
0312330537|5.0|A brilliant book.  Without a doubt the most wonderful book I have read.  Eloquently written, I was moved to tears, laughter and love at every turn.
0316098337|5.0|This book is about Jack and his Ma, living in Room. Room is where Old Nick keeps them. Old Nick brings them some things they ask for, but not much. Poor Jack was born in this room, but he doesn't realize that it isn't normal. TV is make-believe. The things he sees on it can't be real. Only room is real. Ma wants out though. She devises a plan, and Jack is a big part of it. Will they get out? If they do, will they survive on the outside?<br />I literally could not put this book down.<br />About 10 pages into it, I really thought I was going to get sick of it. It is written from Jack's, and he is 5. I thought the grammatical errors (on purpose, of course) would drive me crazy. I soon forgot about them.<br />I was so drawn into this book. I had to know what was going to happen to him and his Ma. My biggest fear was that everything would go horribly wrong. You will have to read the book to find out if it does
1416594795|5.0|This book should be read by everyone who says \\"I don't see how evolution can be, therefore it can't be.\\" Of course few such people will read the book. The book will arm the rest of us with knowledge so we can more confidently confront the ignorant.<br /><br />This book is full of observations that contradict creationism, intelligent design or any explanation that involves a designer at all.<br /><br />Read it today and then go correct those who should read the book but won't.
B002SRQ214|4.0|I have to tell you, after trying out AMD for the first time when building my own PC I was an ecstatic 100% convert! I give it 5 stars for price/performance, and 4 stars overall, because well....there are other CPUs faster and better than this. I've had this CPU for 2-3 years now and it has not failed me with any games. It is stable, and takes on pretty much whatever you throw at it. If you want a really good gaming PC, or to convert video with convertxtodvd this cpu will do that in under an hour. You don't NEED top of the line, best of the best, extreme edition etc. etc. And at this price plus performance, its a STEAL. You can't go wrong with AMD its the best bang for your buck. Don't ever let anyone tell you otherwise. With my current build of 965 BE, 750watt psu, 8gb of cheap ddr2 dual channel memory, after market cooler, Cooler Master HAF full tower case, and Radeon HD 5850, I have been able to play Crysis, Dead Space 2, Resident Evil 5, and any other game on High settings. You can probably even do a cheaper build than mine and still get great performance. I can browse the internet, scan my pc for viruses, convert a movie, and watch one all at the same time and not experience slowdown. Unfortunately I have a horribly frustrating habit....I like to splurge lol. when I have money to burn, burn I do. I get bored easily. Computers, gadgets, and electronics are my passion and hobby. I love to build and upgrade. So I'm going to upgrade to a core i7 cpu, new motherboard with Sata 6gb and USB 3.0, and 12gb DDR3 triple channel memory, simply because I now want to try a core i7 950. I'm also going to add a bluray drive. I don't need this upgrade, but its time. But don't hesitate to buy this CPU, it will do you just awesomely. You can't beat amazon.com Prime Membership. Free 2 day shipping and no taxes :)
0596009208|1.0|I dislike all of the Head First series that I have read. Head First Java is no exception. I am a professional working on a master's in software engineering. I do not want or need fluff. I want to get into the nuts and bolts quickly. This book is useless in this regard. I also find the presentation of the material insulting. Serious programmers/engineers should look to Java How To Program by Deitel as an authority. Head First java may be interesting and useful to the young, those who need to be entertained to learn, or have zero to minimal exposure to Java/Programming. I will not be purchasing another title in the Head First Series. If you need this text for class, you are better served by Deitel and/or web searches.
B000BSLU2S|5.0|It does what it needs to do! I've got good temperatures on my CPU coupled with an after market cooler. Be sure to read up and watch videos on how to apply correctly. Do NOT pack it on. All you need is a BB size drop in the middle. Regardless, don't hesitate, this is a good purchase, and a must of course.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|As much as I hate to admit it, Kanye West is a very talented musician. This album is such a departure from what is happening in much of rap right now, and I love it for that. There's not a stinker in the lineup. And it only gets better with repeat listens.  Usually I don't care for features and guest spots, but Mr. West chooses his friends wisely. I don't think it is too strong to say that a thorough and attentive listening to this album will change your life.
B003XMXZCW|5.0|This review is not for the movie itself but for the Blu Ray quality.  I first watched this movie as a kid 23 years ago on TV and was instantly hooked.  I have since owned the VHS and DVD versions of the film and have watched them repeatedly many times over the years.  I decided to purchase the blu ray version after reading all the positive reviews about the excellent video and audio quality.  Before buying the movie I had to decide whether I wanted to get the much more expensive 3-disc edition or the less pricey 2-disc edition.  From my perspective, I only cared about the movie and didnt really need all the extras so the 2 disc edition was perfect for me.  I was very happy to find that this edition also includes Apocalypse Redux and the extra disc contains a bunch of special features.  So not only did I save a ton of money buying the 2 disc version but I still got some good bonus material on top of that!  As for the video and audio quality, all I can say is hats off to whoever supervised the blu ray transfer.  It is truly a masterpiece and the movie has never looked and sounded better.  If you are in any way a fan of this movie and don't own a blu ray player its almost worth buying a blu ray player just so you can enjoy this film in high definition glory.  I have a mid-range home theater system with high def video and audio setup so the boost in quality was huge for me when compared to the DVD version.   This blu ray version is highly recommended for older fans of the film as well as anyone who has never seen the movie before.
0385341679|1.0|After reading the last book in the series, I was sure this one would be fantastic, since the last one's ending was a bit sick. But, I am even more disappointed in this one. Would the story EVER get started??? Like many other readers here, I don't really care what's in Mac's head. Does she really think she knows it all? Not! I had to give up after reading so many pages of her hyper-hysteria in her own mind. Maybe I'll try again some day. At least I didn't lose any money on it. Library copy.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|This series was produced at the same time that my wife and I started a small hotel, only 50 miles from Torquay, Devon where Fawlty Towers is located.  It quickly became cult viewing amongst hoteliers and restaurateurs in Britain, and after 30 years, it is still very, very funny.
0811876373|3.0|I love Bakerella and her blog! Her projects are beyond wonderful, especially the cake pops. But the book could have used a heavier hand in the editing department. Many of the projects were already available on the blog. I bought the book to hopefully find dozens more projects. The book is repetitious and tedious. Seems to me a lot of info is needlessly repeated to fluff up the page count. An insanely detailed section about what candy-melt colors are available from which vendors comes to mind. BUT the basic recipe for the cake pops themselves -- the very HEART of the book, in my opinion -- calls for \\"three quarters of a can of frosting.\\" Too much results in too-moist cake balls. What, 50 re-iterations of the glory of toothpicks, but you can't tell me the exact measurements of the frosting that goes into the cake pop recipe? Also, only one small mention to avoid whipped varieties of frostings? Given that seemingly half of all canned frostings on the shelves are \\"whipped\\", you'd think this would be highlighted a bit more than it was. I don't mean to be picky, but a bit more precision here is called for. That said, every single project here is adorable and do-able. The photography is gorgeous and helpful.
B002JVWRAY|5.0|Every since the series turned the corner to make this less about monsters in the closet and instead a rich intersection of Gothic lore and epic/thematic religious battles, it has gone from a solid program to a great one.    If you love stories that pit heaven vs. hell. This has succeeded where many movies have failed. Or at least petered out. If you had high hopes for movies like Legion, but was supremely disappointed, this will not. The stories have the rich construction of movies like the Prophecy, Needful Things, and perhaps even elements of Constantine, Stigmata, & Nightbreed. But updated for the 21st Century.    Where this exceeds all of these is on top of the carefully, woven stories; you have extremely good character development. The Bond between Dean and Sam is one of the best I've seen written. The supporting cast is richly developed as well. But the kicker is hands down the dialogue. With Joss Whedon absent. This is as close as you're going to get. Just just straight up funny. The clever use of pop culture references is refreshing and gives the dark theme balance.    The 5th Season is the best yet (available). Now that it's Blu Ray, it can show off the use of lighting and color pallet. I love the cinematography here.    Simply put. If you're a Sci-Fi person; get it. If you like witty dialogue and character development; get it. If you like Vampires, Werewolves, and certainly Epic Battles between Heaven & Hell; GET IT!
B004EI3ON4|5.0|It is just simply amazing, great soundtrack, would recomend to anyone who likes both Tron de movie (original and legacy) and DaftPunk! simply enjoy.
B001OGWY1W|2.0|A terrible Batman movie. Too long, too complicated and the sound is awful. A dud! I kept wishing it would just end, yet it dragged on and on. Heath Ledgers' performance was the reason to watch the whole movie. I'm glad I only spent $2.99, still that was $2.98 too much.
B001F0WXY0|1.0|I wanted to get this for my 16 year-old son, but refuse to pay the price for the Ebook. I love my e-reader and hope to never buy a traditionally bound book again, but when the Ebook is more costly than a bound book .... Well Amazon just lost a sale.    With that said, I think anyone who is an officiando of great Sci-Fi, that has something to say, should read at least the first three Dune books. I personally got burned out after three, but have never forgotten the ones I read and would love to share them with my son.
B003V4AK8E|4.0|I bought this controller because I was gaming on the 360 for quite a long time and I got used to the controller layout. Then I bought a PS3 and the controller was a wake up call to find something more like the 360 controller. At first I bought the Dreamgear Shadow 6 and It was OK but it was much smaller than I wanted. Then the Power A Pro Elite came out and I bought that one too and It's the only one I've used ever since. In case anyone is asking my controller has NO DEADZONES and I mean NONE. I directly compared it to my DualShock 3 and there was NO DIFFERENCE in sensitivity, I play alot of Battlefield Bad Company 2 and I've never had a problem with aiming. The size is even a bit larger than the 360 controller so when I play my 360, the controller feels a bit small because I'm so used to my Power A.    I never regret buying this controller and I've recommended it to all my friends.    I only gave it 4 stars because since this does use a dongle I've had some connection problems with the controller disconnecting for a brief second (my shadow 6 never had that problem). It's never been a big problem, I've only had it disconnect during an online match a few times but it has happened.    Overall I wouldn't play my PS3 without it.
B0030L2BWG|4.0|Graceling, as well as Fire, are imaginational full fictional stories with character rich figures with big personalities. Through reading this I've experienced the challenging changes that events can have on people, and how their personalities renew and die as they grow in response. I was caught in the story at several times and by reading the text could almost feel the mentality of the author when she was in her zone and got crazy with the descriptive detail. I loved the emotional journey and unraveling of the conspiracy, to the point that I got disappointed when I reached the last pages. I didn't want the story the end. I hope there will be more thrilling stories written in The Seven Kingdoms and The Dells to keep Kristin's fantasy world alive. Although I enjoyed Graceling, I would suggest for first time readers to start with Fire. Fire is more throughout well done and helped me to fall in love with the author, while Graceling was a tougher read that I read primarily because I enjoyed the works of Kristin Cashore.
B0009FTXGI|4.0|You (like me) are only looking at buying this hood instead of the official Canon one because you can't understand how a piece of plastic can be $50+ after you just spent a small fortunate on your lenses.    Well, this lens hood fits just fine (you are probably sticking it on your Canon 10-22?), it is cheaply made in that the threaded portion that locks on to the lens and the locking mechanism that clicks into place don't look well constructed and don't feel that great but they go on fine (with some fidgeting) and will stay on and do their job blocking light.    If you just bought an L-lens though, don't use this, go spend the money on the official Canon lens hood. They fit better, are built better and will compliment that lens a bit more.    So in short, this gets the job done, but definitely seems like a value-hood. In my case, that was just fine, so I'm happy.
B002ZG97RE|1.0|Paul Greengrass.  I say no more.  This guy should be locked up, put away, and throw the key away.  He ruined, no, I say destroyed the Jason Bourne series by directing the second and third movie.  What is with this guy, shaking the camera all over the place, until your head starts spinning around?  I love Matt Damon, and think he is a great actor.  Even the story plot for this movie was good, but the camera and photography, were an absolute shambles.  Dont buy this movie.  Borrow it from a friend instead, if you feel a need to get shook up and spun around.  Better yet, go pay for a roller coaster ride instead.  The director destroyed this movie, hands down, and after that, nothing else matters.   I dont care how good that actors are, or how good the story line is, or the plot, but if you can't watch the movie with out feeling like you are sitting in an earthquake, nothing matters anymore.
0670021652|5.0|The author has unique voice which once again came through, although clearly matured and somewhat  transformed from that of her earlier years (as it should be in life!).  I sense that we, the readers,  will continue to benefit from her wisdom, self examination (some of you did not get that part, did you?)  and genuineness again. Others here have gone the \\"book review\\" route and expressed sentiments similar to my own, so I will just say it was brave, clear, laugh- out -loud funny in parts, sobering and thought provoking in others...inspiring us to examine parts of our lives as well.
0307266303|2.0|Long winded. Probably could have been condensed by half.  I agree with \\"Marthoner\\" and some of the other 3 star reviews.  Yes, take it with a grain of salt and the author rambles - quite a bit.  It is entertaining at times but not what one would expected from the title.
0195067142|5.0|This book encapsulates the great hardships that American soldiers endured to protect \\"WORLD\\" freedom.What our troops went through to help liberate Europe and the western<br />Pacific from brutal,tyrannical invaders was noble in every way and no apologies are required, as some would suggest. Mr.Sledge is very clear in his condemnation of war, yet is highly cognizant that it was the stubborn nature of the fascist Japanese empire that led to far more human suffering than was necessary to<br />bring the conflict to an end. It was obvious from the huge loss of life on Guadalcanal and Okinawa that the A-bombs prevented even more senseless suffering and dying had we had to invade the Japanese mainland by conventional means.An excellent book from start to end.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|We laughed until we cried - all three generations of us and it wasn't even Christmas.  Now need to get the others in this series, if they are half as good we will be happy.  Previously went from store to store to find this, know where we will look next time.
1401307450|5.0|Scar Tissue is a wonderfully written semi-autobiography by Anthony Kiedes about Anthony Kiedes. It is a riveting and tell-tale story of the slow but eventually meteoric rise of the Red Hot Chili Peppers but more importantly a tale of life long friendships, broken relationships, battling addictions, and memories of a lifetime. Anthony Kiedes tells a very compelling, well composed story about all things Scar Tissue. Definitely a book everyone should read~
B00005M4JS|4.0|I don't normally watch this type of movie but was suprised that I really liked it.  The story is a complex story of a woman and her daughter starting again in a small backward village by opening a chocolate shop.  My only complaint is that Johnny Depps character isn't seen more.
B003JIM9G8|5.0|This movie was great. It was jam packed with action, drama and suspense.This movie brings me back to the days where I would watch Batman Beyond or the first animated Batman series that used to air on Cartoon Network.    To put it short, this movie is amazing because it has a(n):  1)Amazing plot, with an ending that will keep glued to your seat  2)a mature feel, although it's a cartoon the movie is made more enjoyable by making it a little more realistic with scenes of Batman getting whooped and occasional blood.    3)great dialogue, the characters stay true to Batman tradition  4)art style, the art style isn't too flashy with effects and gives the movie a dark/noire feeling.    Get this movie. There is no way you can be dissappointed. A great movie topped with great Amazon service. You can't beat that.
0140277447|1.0|Several historians, Western and Japanese historians who exhaustedly collected evidence related to Nanking, disputed her book with facts and figures, and battle reports from IJA from division commanders down to lowly privates. If you REALLY want to know the truth, read The Nanking Massacre: Fact Versus Fiction.     How can the IJA \\"murdered 300,000 Chinese in Nanking\\" when Chinese census from late 1937 had the population numbered around 281,000? According to the Japanese scouts weeks before the seige, they reported mass exodus of Chinese population from the city, a reporter from Chicago Times who was in Nanking Safety Zone also confirmed.    Rape of Nanking's purpose was to stoke Chinese ultra-nationalism and to force the Japanese government to apologize.     From historical perspective, the book is pure fabrication.
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie, and I am one hard sell. It takes a LOT to impress me. The acting, the humor, the brilliant soundtrack, the family dysfunctions, the amazing outdoor scenery, and just the VERY sensitive way this subject matter was handled simply blew me away. This movie won't ( sadly)  be for everyone but.. as the quote on the cover says: \\" Life is a journey.. bring an open mind\\" , I hope people watch it with an open mind and learn about love, tolerance,  self respect.
0143118420|1.0|To be really honest, this book is RATHER relaxing- until you think about it a little more clearly, which isn't hard to do because despite the search for God, there isn't really that much depth. Gilbert comes across as self-absorbed, whiny, and way too male-dependent. I thought this would be about an empowered women finding God and realizing that men aren't really that important. Instead, Gilbert refuses to let the subject of couple-love go, even as she sits in an ashram in India searching for that higher power. Obviously, being self-absorbed is,at times, an entitlement- it is my firm opinion, however, that Gilbert takes it just a little too far. She does bring in other characters at times, but it would have been so much more interesting if she had tried to explore THEIR journeys through the mysteries of their minds. Instead, she continues probing her mind for answers to her extremely broad questions about life. At one point, it just seems as though she should relax. Even while sitting in a restaurant in Italy eating the most delicious food on earth, she can't calm her mind for a few minutes. Yes, she does bring interesting insights at other times, but overall, she has written a book about her extremely annoying thoughts and self-absorption.

0061854549|4.0|The author is a supporter of the Tversky-Kahneman approach ,called behavioral economics,that has amassed overwhelming empirical,laboratory and experimental evidence since the mid 1970's that humans are not utility maximizing followers of Jeremy Bentham.The modern version of Benthamite Utilitarianism is called Subjective Expected Utility(SEU).SEU theory assumes that the decision makers know all  of the outcomes that are relevant.It assumes that the decision maker can assign accurate and reliable probabilities to all of these outcomes.All of the probabilities are additive and linear .This Benthamite Utilitarian decision environment can be described as assuming that the weight of the evidence or knowledge,w,supporting the decision makers probability estimates ,is complete.Keynes,who devised the first decision theoretic rule in history ,as well as the first index to measure the completeness of the information,data,evidence or knowledge,showed that w must equal 1,where w is defined on the unit interval between 0 and 1,[0,1],for SEU theory to be both valid and sound.Keynes's point was obvious- if w<1 then it is not possible to apply any of the expected value or expected utility variants used by the economics profession and accepted as norms of behavior by Tversky,Kahneman and their followers in behavioral economics and psychology unless intervals are used .The reader should note that the only point of disagreement between the economics profession and the behavioral school of Tversky and Kahneman is over the descriptive accuracy of SEU theory,which is the modern version of Bentham's approach to utility maximization.There is no disagreement over the normative role of SEU theory.SEU theory should serve as a guide to decision making in the real world according to the normative assessment of Tversky and Kahneman.J M  Keynes and D Ellsberg would completely reject this conclusion.    Unfortunately,Ariely also takes SEU theory as a normative standard for the definition of rationality.The heuristics,rules of thumb and short cuts that decision makers  actually use  in a real world where w < 1 and sometimes close to 0 are regarded as errors in thinking that need to be corrected.Ariely accepts the goal of utility maximization as being the only definition of rationality that is acceptable.     Ariely is totally ignorant of the work in decision theory of JM Keynes.Nowhere in his book is Keynes ever mentioned.He is also ignorant of the work of Herbert Simon.Simon correctly argues that ,even if w were equal to 1,the cognitive and information processing constraints implied by SEU theory are so onerous that decision makers correctly decide to concentrate on a subset of the total knowledge/evidence set when making a decision because decision makers are not utility maximizers but utility satisfisers.Simon's bounded versus substantive rationality constructs,published in the late 1940's -early 1950's,are a standard source in decision theory.Ariely's failure to even consider the work of Keynes and Simon calls into question the claim that maximizing is rational while satisficing is irrational.    The rationality definition of SEU theory only holds in the special case where w=1.Ariely characterizes all of the short cuts,heuristics and rules of thumb used by decision makers in the general case where w<1 as \\" irrational \\".In fact,Ariely has it upside down.It is only rational to accept SEU theory in the special case where w=1.It is irrational to use SEU theory in any case where w<1.    This book is interesting for the mass of empirical results that are reported.Unfortunately,far too often behavioral patterns are labeled as \\" irrational \\" that are\\"  irrational' only on the supposition that w = 1 so that the purely mathematical laws of the probability calculus can be applied.This supposition breaks down completely,except as a limiting case,when w < 1.  A w < 1 means that the laws of the probability calculus can not be used because no one probability distributioncan be shown to be the correct unique distribution to use in a real world situation.This is obvious in the case where the probabilities are estimated to be intervals.Keynes was the first to  present a fully operational interval estimate approach to probability based on the work of George Boole.It is always possible for the author to come out with another revised edition.One can hope that the work of Keynes and Simon is given their due.
B004IB28RK|5.0|Having just come home from seeing Gregg live in concert at Penn's Peak where he performed some of the Low Country Blues songs live for only the second time since the album release, I have to say that this is going to be one of my favorite and most oft played blues and Gregg Allman albums. THIS is music!. This album is overflowing with slow burning emotion and depth, and speaks to where Gregg is in his life journey right now. The creativity of T-Bone Burnett enhances the gritty, soulful qualities of Gregg's music. My favorites include Please Accept My Love (B.B. King), Floating Bridge (Sleepy John Estes) and Little By Little (Junior Wells). He also pays tribute to other bluesmen including Muddy Waters (I Can't Be Satisfied), Bobby Bland (Blind Man) and Magic Sam (My Love is Your Love). Gregg wrote one original tune on the album and hits a home run with the walking bass line of Just Another Rider.     I refuse to penalize Gregg Allman for the crap quality of the Amazon mp3 files. Having listened to the iTunes-compressed files and music directly from the CD, the amazon download files are terribly unbalanced due to file compression. Horribly thumpy bass lines that overwhelm the rest of the music is NOT my idea of great sales tactics. I was suckered by the cheaper price and instant gratification on the night of the album's release. Lesson learned, I'll refrain from DLing music from Amazon ever again.
1439110123|5.0|The economic development of the past 200 years has been both remarkable and entirely unanticipated. Over this period, the average person in the U.S. has been able to increase his well-being by a multiple of at least 37, using conservative measures of real per capita GDP over time.<br /><br />Affordable technologies, such as the washing machine, automobile, airplane, television, medical equipment, cheap clothing, air conditioning, freight transport, etc., have enabled the common man to have access to the 19th Century equivalent of approximately 99 servants (voluntary or otherwise). The economic base of these technologies has been plentiful and cheap energy. Coal, oil, natural gas and nuclear energy have replaced or supplemented the labor of 19th Century servants, which was only accessible to the elites and ruling classes of the time.<br /><br />Thus, in order to understand the economic development of the last 200 years, we need to understand the history of energy. In \\"The Prize,\\" Daniel Yergin provides a very interesting and reasonably comprehensive history of oil. Clocking in at approximately 900 pages, Yergin documents the people, enterprises, technologies and political intrigue that have shaped our modern conception of oil. However, don't let the heft of the tome intimidate you. Yergin's writing style and storytelling are accessible and the book was hard to put down. The only downside is that the book ends at the first Iraq war and has not been updated in subsequent re-issues.<br /><br />The most interesting themes in the book are as follows:<br /><br />* The boom and bust cycle:  The debates over peak oil have been with us from almost the very beginning of large scale oil production.  Used first as an illuminate and then subsequently transformed into a source of motor power, oil has gone through several cycles of being incredibly cheap (i.e. free) to being a source of extreme anxiety over scarcity and price.<br /><br />* Political conflict:  The quest for oil has led to severe political conflicts and its abundance or scarcity among enemies has impacted the outcomes of several wars, particularly WWII.<br /><br />* Economic rents:  While the conflict over oil concessions and revenue splits has largely been resolved, Ricardian rents in oil and whether these rents should accrue primarily to the oil producers or the host countries provides an interesting real-world example of this economic concept.<br /><br />* The tragedy of the commons: The manner in which oil rights are defined can lead to \\"over grazing\\" (i.e. premature exhaustion) since no one has a property right in the reserve itself. A reserve's yield is dependent on its inherent pressure and this pressure decreases as more wells are drilled to access it. Enterprises and governments have a difficult time overcoming this problem as antitrust laws collide with government sanctioned production quotas meant to alleviate overproduction.<br /><br />* The resource curse: Having sovereignty over a large oil reserve is a lot like winning the lottery. Your wealth and happiness are anything but assured (e.g. Iran, Libya, and Iraq).<br /><br />We consumers love the technologies and increased well-being that cheap energy enables. But, we continue to have a deep-seated concern about the impact of oil on the environment and resource dependency. Since this ambivalence will be with us for the foreseeable future, Yergin's book will continue to be relevant even though it has not been updated since the early 1990s. Recommended.its abundance or scarcity among enemies has impacted the outcomes of several wars, particularly WWII.    * Economic rents:  While the conflict over oil concessions and revenue splits has largely been resolved, Ricardian rents in oil and whether these rents should accrue primarily to the oil producers or the host countries provides an interesting real-world example of this economic concept.    * The tragedy of the commons: The manner in which oil rights are defined can lead to \\"over grazing\\" (i.e. premature exhaustion) since no one has a property right in the reserve itself.

B001QKSWOE|5.0|Finished this book after wicked appetite. Though it was funny but Carl the Monkey really hit his prime in Wicked Appetite. I really enjoy these books- they are lighthearted funny, rarely too serious. Just a nice esape from the daily grind- if you don't laugh while reading these books- you need shock therapy.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Another exceptional book from Stieg Larsson.  It is unfortunate the author lived only to the age of 50 years old.  I can only imagine the treasure of literature he could have bestowed upon us.  After reading all three of the Salander Series, I was left wanting more.  If you like mystery mixed in with family, journalistic & political dynamics, you will love this book along with the entire series.  Each book can stand on its own; however, I recommend you read the series beginning with the first book, \\"Girl With The Dragon Tatoo.\\"  Salander is a character you will love at the same time wonder if she is who you would wish her to be!  Enjoy!

B004HAG40O|3.0|I am rather disappointed with this latest album. I enjoyed \\"Hazards of Love\\" and I was hoping they would continue in that direction. I was unpleasantly surprised with \\"The King is Dead\\". It feels so generic; like you stripped the \\"moody\\" from the Moody Blues, smashed it together with the below average REM songs and added a harmonica. Essentially its safe folk rock that I heard ad nauseum when going to festivals with my parents. My parents would love this album.    With that said it is not horrible, but every time I click on The Decemberists I will almost always go for Hazards of Love and The Crane Wife. I enjoy \\"Dont Carry It All\\" and \\"Rox In The Box\\", but have a hard time listening all the way through the album without wishing for something more.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book pulled me in & kept hold of me until the last page. I'm going to read it again, because I stayed up all night reading it. I can't stop thinking about Ma & her child living in that small room.
0061544493|3.0|I bought this book because I was always a fan of how Victoria looked in magazines when pictured, and was hoping to pick up some tips/tricks from her. I found it to be rather run-of-the-mill as far as advice goes....I picked up a few tips, but most of the information contained is common sense. The photographs of her are repeated throughout the book as well, and aren't the most flattering images I've seen of Mrs. Beckham. I found the book to be entertaining, however, and enjoyed reading it because of her conversational nature. As I was reading, I really felt like I was listening to Victoria herself speaking. If you are not familiar with British terminology, be prepared to be somewhat confused...a vest is not what we in the US call a vest, but is rather what we would refer to as a \\"wife beater\\" or \\"undershirt\\". What we would refer to as a \\"vest\\", she refers to as a \\"waistcoat\\". Once I understood the differences, this book made a lot more sense! At the end of each chapter, Victoria lists brands/stores that carry each item to her liking...if you live in the US, be prepared to shop online since many of the stores do not have locations here.   Overall, I found this book entertaining to read, and I feel slightly more connected to my fashion icon. I didn't really learn anything new, but I'm not sorry that I purchased this book.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I'd seen the movie at the theater and enjoyed the music much more than the storyline.  Bought the c.d., and have thoroughly enjoyed it again and again.  This is great music for doing a little home exercise, or slogging through another day of chores; it just peps you up, and makes you want to move.  Cher has a song that is reminiscent of \\"Gypsies, Tramps & Thieves\\" - so if you're old enough to have enjoyed that, you'll probably like her here, too.  Christina is amazing.  Her voice just gets stronger as she matures.  What is amazing is that she can grind it out one minute, and still sound like an angel the next.
B003DZX3SA|1.0|I ordered this for a friend's daughter before Christmas but, due to our busy lives/schedules, couldn't give it to her until a couple months later.  I never thought I would have an issue that would require me to have to return it, but I just received a call that the movie has \\"lines running through it\\" throughout various parts of the movie.  So of course the return policy ended a few days ago and the DVD is now un-returnable.  Totally disappointing and unacceptible that Amazon would sell something so poor quality.  Guess I should've known better when I bought a Disney item from someplace other than Disney.  :(
B0025UHKNS|4.0|First time user of such an item and to be honest, I really like it! It motivates me to go that extra mile or two. Overall a pretty awesome tool/toy.
B004FQX5CK|5.0|This is the version that you want to buy, unless you are a fanboy of Blade Runner and want all five versions of the film. If you want the best version for cheap (given the quality of the film, $13.99 is a steal) this is the one for you. I was blown away by the special effects, sets, costumes, make-up, acting, directing, cinematography, etc., in this film. Truly a masterpiece and it is brought to life on Blu-Ray. You can tell immediately that the studio did not cheap out on transferring this film to HD, it looks awesome. Just buy it, you won't regret it!
B002GYVRRI|4.0|I have avoided earlier releases of Red as I have the vinyl original. This version was well worth getting.  The sound is excellent. The extras are worthwhile and the video priceless.  I have not heard the surround mixes yet, but from all reports I will not be disappointed.
B003REEPJS|1.0|I disliked Miley Cyrus ever since she broke away from Disney (where she was relatively unknown to me for many blissful years) and watching her struggle to be taken seriously has been like watching a comedy of errors. Everything from the photoshoot with her father to throwing a tantrum about Radiohead to the stripper-esque performance she pulled has been nothing more than a laughable attempt by a TEENAGER to be viewed as an adult. She's the example I use of an individual doing adult things but still remain a child emotionally. I had no intention of buying anything with her name attached to it.    Then I heard \\"Can't Be Tamed\\". Out of dozens of other songs she has performed, this one song made me look at her and say: \\"Okay kiddo, let's see what else you've got\\". The entire album is trash with the exception of the ONE song - her hit \\"Can't Be Tamed\\". Her video wasn't even what I imagined it would be like and was actually far more interesting than watching Taylor Swift once again pine away over some boy. If her music continues along the same vein as \\"Can't Be Tamed\\", she may turn into an actual artist, who may be worth listening to one day. But if the other craptacular songs on her album are an indicator of where she's heading, then she'll be nothing more than just another whiny teenbopper pop idol.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Very moving book. I had resisted getting it thinking I might not like it. The summary really doesn't do it justice. It so happy in moments I was smiling as I read. Then so heart-wrenchingly sad in others that I couldn't read through the tears. I will be reading this again with my 12 year old son. Excellent book.
0596009208|2.0|This is a book that I really wanted to like. I actually do think the humor is pretty cute and engaging. I have a better understanding of what OOP means thanks to this book. But for actual programming in java? Nope. This book skips over the basics that everyone needs to know just to get a simple program to work in order to focus on the deep concepts and fun things like MIDI beatboxes that you will never get to work.<br /><br />Now, it's not as if I don't know the difference between a for loop and a while loop. I know how to do them in C++, Python and Pascal thanks to books by Gaddis and Savitch. It's just that I have no clue how to implement these basic things *in Java.*<br /><br />Now, the book says that you should have 'some' programming experience and I do. No, you really do need to have a lot of programming experience in Java before this will be of any use. But I think such a person will be looking for a more in depth book.
B00328R21C|5.0|My five year old grandson believes that Legos are great but only Star Wars Legos rule.  (I now have some Toy Story Legos I am going to have to find another home for.) Legos are durable, fascinating, challenging and fun.  The wordless directions can be followed with equal ease by a 5 year old and his father/mother/grandmother. One joy of giving my grandson Legos is that now his father can step on them, barefoot, in the middle of the night, just as I used to do when that father was five years old. So this is a gift that pleases both the recipient and the giver.<br /><br />I have to say that the imagination of the Legos developers never ceases to impress me.  This is a classic toy.
B00136NYR6|4.0|i checked google maps and the current hwy 61 now stops only a little north of the twin cities, but back when i traveled that area (mid 1970's) it ran parallel with interstate 35 all the way from twin cities to duluth. when bob dylan left northern minnesota there was no interstate 35. so hwy 61 was the main  road from nowhere to everywhere.     no one can be sure what dylan had in mind when he titled his album,  but it might give some perspective to understand the significance of hwy 61 to a young man from northern minnesota.
0316286850|5.0|Making Faces is one of those books that anyone who has an interest in make up should own.  Yes, the instructions are a bit vague at times but I've always just counted that as he is assuming you already know how to apply make up.    All in all the book is worth owning.  There are lovely pictures and is a wonderful starting point for changing the way you apply make up.
0956031609|2.0|The movie was delightful and fast-paced; and because I liked the characters so much, I bought the book.  The prose is good, but it's so slow and the movie is so true to it that I didn't find any incentives to chase after scenes.  It was, unfortunately, a chore to finish.  OTOH, I did enjoy \\"I Can't Think Straight\\" by the same author.  So maybe this is just one of those books I would've enjoyed more if I had read it first before watching the movie.
B000PKX2KA|4.0|Bought this gps to use for marine navigation on a laptop.  It is reasonably easy to set up and seems to works well.  Haven't had a chance to see how waterproof it is yet.  Could have used a longer cable - it is only about 4 1/2 feet long.  Also, the suction cup mount is not a great design (it attaches to the cable rather than the gps itself, so it leaves the gps free to bounce about.  Overall, a good deal.

B004DK5CW4|5.0|The movie in its self was excellent,BUT,the song they chose for the end of the race was terrible and in my opinion,ruined the ending of the picture.they could have had a much better song like seabiscuit..I don't know what they were thinking..but that's my opinion..I hope you enjoy this film as much as I did.its great.. Starlite
B004MDXMS8|1.0|2 dollars an episode Is way too much to charge, episodes used to be one dollar and even that was excessive. It shouldn't cost more than 10 cence to watch an episode. I will not be using amazon for streaming video again untill they Lower their prices.
B0000041LO|5.0|Call me old but this music brings back my youth. Haydn, the Father of the Symphony, knew a thing or two about other classical genres. His genius shines through these piano trios. These works are very special and I play them often. The vinyl sound is so pure and intimate and the cd sound very dynamic and broader. It would be unjust to listen to the box set in one sitting, especially for those of us who enjoy variety. This set will be worth your pleasure.  I would be remiss not to mention the preeminent musicians who made this music their own......The Beaux Arts Trio: Menahem Pressler, piano; Isidore Cohen, violin; Bernard Greenhouse, cello. These discs are as fresh as any recorded and the trio preserves a very distinctive musical heritage. Without a doubt, this trio is the hallmark of chamber music. Pure enlightenment and highly recommended.
B002ZG993Q|2.0|Unclear and Confusing.  Too many frames unrelated to the story line.  So what if  a tatooed Clooney can do pullups.
B003Y5H4SY|3.0|This film had the potential to be great. However it lacked one key element I never got emotionally involved with the characters. Who was the jumper and why? Where were the momentary flashbacks of each persons sins so I could choose which one I disliked more?  No self description in the elevator so I could pity one more than the other.  I felt nothing for any of them when they were in the elevator until the end with the one member but by then it was too late to care. (I really wanted to hope and cheer for someone but could not) What I did not get in fright I also did not get in emotion, too bad if they had coupled it right it would have been great instead of thin.
0156027321|5.0|life of pi is such a wonderful story. if you want a book that you'll never forget this is the book you want. i still cannot stop thinking about it and i finished it a week ago. halfway through the book it got really slow  but don't get discouraged. read it, finish it. the ending is everything.
B004HWR406|4.0|Who would figure that a social outcast would become rich by creating a social network, talk about revenge of the nerds! Kept my interest, no over the top embellishment.  Believable cut throat world of business where those who can not create latch on to the coat tails of those who can.  And super successful nerds are alone for a reason.
1400052173|1.0|This is a wonderful story written to death.  Should have been 200 pages shorter.  Henrietta should have been the focus but the family was instead... with no conclusion except for another death.  Not so good.
1933492953|5.0|Five stars, all the way.  As far as a comicbook art books: this is the cream of the crop.      He spends NO time on how you draw and all the time on how you SHOW what you draw. How setting characters up to seem more powerful and central.  How to imply character relationship with spacial relationships. How to imply distance and movement.  How to hint at many but draw few. How to dynamically frame action.  This book really gets into the nitty gritty behind setting up the panel/page to give you the best coverage and easiest read.    His explanation of the 180 degree rule is phenomenal. He lays out some scenes then diagrams the camera moves. If you don't know the 180 degree rule he lays it out perfectly. If you do know the rule he illustrates why it works so well.      The section in the back is specifically for Graphic Novels but EVERYTHING is relevant. In fact the Graphic Novel section might be the least informative part of this book for comics.    I can't recommend this book enough. The amount of behind the panel information he gets you to think through will change the way you think about drawing your comic.
B002ZG98C8|4.0|Bloddripping, - funny because it's totally unrealistic and served to the audience with a smile. Trejo is perfect as Machete and the chicks are stunning. The audience for this film is most likely male - and males with an unpolished sense of humor.
B004AKCME8|4.0|When I picked this up I was expecting a run-of-the-mill children's animated film, complete with songs, cheesy jokes, and the usual.  From the second I started watching, though, I knew I was in for a completely different experience.  By the end of the film, I was completely blown away.  I mean, I was expecting something on the level of \\"Monsters Vs. Aliens\\" but instead I got the animated version of Lord of the Rings - you know, if Gandalf and company were CGI owls.      Speaking of the plot, this is the quintessential \\"hero's tale\\" that's been told and re-told about a million times.  That being said, if a film isn't compelling enough then this sort of story can end up feeling stale and re-hashed.  So, does \\"Legend of the Guardians\\" succeed or fail?  Well, I feel like it's a success.  I never felt bored the whole time I was watching.  Even though a lot of familiar elements and themes are present (hero's journey, family members betraying each other, evil overlords, etc.), there were also a lot of times where I thought to myself \\"Oh, I bet that this will happen\\", but it never did!  They managed to avoid enough of the cliches to keep the film from feeling too predictable.  My only complaints about the actual story are the fact that some things remain unexplained, and the film engaging in obvious sequel-baiting (something I'm not fond of since they can't really guarantee that sequel will ever come).  Overall, though, I'm pretty pleased.    So, I've already established that I enjoyed the film greatly - but I'm an adult.  Even though \\"Legend of the Guardians\\" is marketed as a children's film, parents might want to exercise caution in allowing their children to see this.  It's fairly violent (but not gory), and even though they try to throw in some brief comic relief, it has an overall atmosphere of seriousness and dread.  I couldn't really give you a definitive age range, but parents should know whether or not their children are too sensitive for a film like this.    Lastly, I need to mention why I've only given this film four stars instead of five.  It has nothing to do with the movie itself and more to do with the set-up of the DVD.  There are several annoying features that really irked me.  First off, when you first turn on the DVD player, if you don't hit the menu button immediately various trailers will start playing.  You CANNOT skip these!  If you try to hit the menu button during a trailer, it won't do anything.  You also cannot use the \\"skip to next scene\\" button.  So, you've either got to turn off the player and try again or wait through all the trailers (and there are a lot).  That's just cruel and inexcusable.  My second complaint has to do with the DVD options.  The only two options you get are \\"play movie\\" and \\"Language\\".  They didn't even have the courtesy to give us a scene select option.  Nor are there any special features of any kind.  I know some people don't care about special features, but I like watching the \\"making-of\\" documentaries and personal interviews with the cast and crew.  It would've been nice to see that here.  Well, anyway, those are my only real complaints.     Despite the minor irritations with the DVD itself, I still recommend this film.  Among hideously vapid movies like \\"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\\", \\"Legend of the Guardians\\" stands out as a quality film that should not be missed.  Even if you're not entirely sure, just rent it first and give it a try.  You might like it as much as I did!
B0002IQNAG|5.0|The original Dawn of the Dead didn't make a big splash when it was released over 30 years ago, but over time society found out its true value. This 4 disc special edition is really the only one to get when it comes to this film. Featuring all 3 versions of the film plus a loaded documentary disc, this is one fans should NOT be without. For those who don't know, DOTD is about a world where zombies have overrun society, and while there are a slew of survivors all over the world, the point has come where life as we know it will come to an end. While the original Night of the Living Dead that was released in 1968 featured a world where zombies were the minority, this film picks up years later where zombies have taken over the majority of society, and whoever is left must fend for themselves. The movie focuses on 4 survivors who take refuge in a shopping mall and try to make a new life there, meanwhile later in the film tensions spikes as they know they cannot be comfortable forever and must fend off invaders.<br />Aside from great effects, fantastic over the top (for its time) gore, and an underlying statement about our zombified society, what really makes DOTD shine is its characterization. All 4 main characters are built up throughout the film and you begin to really care about them; the life they start to make in the shopping mall makes one wonder if they would do the same. George Romero has always had a touch for building good characters and this film is no exception. Critically acclaimed and arguably the GREATEST horror movie ever made (in my personal opinion, it absolutely is), this is one that no fan should be without and no avid horror fan should pass up.<br /><br />Disc 1 includes the U.S. Theatrical version, which actually is George Romero's preferred version, running at 127 minutes you'll get the most well-balanced version of the film available. Includes all the gore and blood that was meant to be in theaters, as well as the genius soundtrack.<br /><br />Disc2 is the full extended version of the film which adds 12 minutes to the original length, running at 139 minutes. While the soundtrack to this version is the same, the movie features extra scenes but at times can just feel a tad too long; still though, because the movie itself is so great one wouldn't mind sitting in an extra 12 minutes. For me personally this is MY preferred version, but contrary to popular opinion, this is NOT the version George Romero himself prefers.<br /><br />Disc 3 is the European cut of the film, and seems to be mostly everyone's LEAST cared for version of the film. And for good cause. The movie runs 118 minutes long and the soundtrack is greatly reworked for the European audience, featuring somewhat stranger ideas in terms of musical tension that comes in the form of funny synth sounds that while still workable, still takes away greatly from the original soundtrack which featured zombies walking and moaning to goofy \\"carnival-like\\" music that really made George Romero's \\"zombie nation\\" statement applicable and note-worthy. Furthermore, in this version, the ending is simply a black screen with credits, whereas in the other versions, credits were atop more zombie \\"pranks\\" with the same carnival type of music, that while on the surface sounds goofy, it still gave the film a pretty creepy touch that gets you smirking on the outside, while feeling a bit uncomfy on the inside.<br />The European version of this film is basically cut to make this more of a straight out action film rather than a psychological spine tingler that the other versions were so good at being. Classic director Dario Argento remade this version to appeal to European audiences, and while it does the job, more art-film enthusiasts may be turned off by it's almost complete lack of psychological creepiness.<br /><br />Disc 4 features 4 different documentaries that fans of this film will absolutely pine over. 2 features are over an hour long each in length, and contain FULL castand production team interviews all these years later, therefore it's VERY fun to see where all these actors are and how they've aged (may I say that the female protagonist of this film, Gaylen Ross, still looks just as gorgeous as she did 30 years ago! Wow!), including George Romero himself. Plus 2 shorter features that are home video shot, one featuring some cast members and zombies (the actors from way back when) going to the actual mall where the film was shot, as well as home videos made during the production of this film. All in all, the documentary feature gives fans a greatly detailed influx of info on this grand horror masterpiece.<br /><br />At this price, it's an easy decision, if you're already a fan of the film, you owe it to yourself to add this to your cart IMMEDIATELY. And for those who have never seen the film, for the price listed this is one buy that will absolutely not let you down.
B003ZK58WM|4.0|Historical scholars will find this book too basic in historical perspective, but for those of us who may not have a firm grasp of the politics and social issues that lead to the massacre of WWI this is a fascinating book. I thought the characters represented many different opinions and their views made sense in light of their personal histories. The only thing I found unbelievable about this book were the massive coincidences that were needed to drive the story, but if you can get past the soap opera-y chance meetings that propel the book I think it is very entertaining as well as informative.  As for the many comments about Kindle pricing....it is the authors who set the price for Kindle versions...not Amazon.
B004APVI1G|5.0|Having recently purchased a 3D TV, we were hungry for some movies. We were very happy with this one. It was a good story, and the 3D was amazing. Much better than others we have seen. We highly recommendthis one.
0743267478|3.0|Slumdog Millionaire is a take-off on the famous quiz show, Who Wants to be a Millionaire. When an 18 year old waiter incredibly answers all 12 questions correctly, he is arrested and locked in jail while the company sponsoring the show tries to prove the waiter cheated so they won't have to pay him. Each chapter of the book is a chapter of the young waiter's life, and it illustrates how he knew the answers to the valuable questions.<br /><br />The questions asked covered a variety of subjects. The possiblity that our protagonist could have enough knowledge of to answer the questions correctly, seemed like a long shot, yet each and every time, the young man was able to give the proper answer. As each question was asked, I was thinking, someone from that game show must have known the protagonist's life story to always be able to choose a question he could answer... yet this was never revealed in the book.<br /><br />While I did find a few points of interest in this overly long tale, I did not find this novel consistently interesting. In fact some chapters were long enough to tempt me to skip some of the tale, which temptation I mostly resisted until the end, when I did skip some of the chapter just before the finale. I found that long chapter to be just too uninteresting. The ending itself was predictable, the book nothing I would recommend to most readers.<br /><br />This review has been simultaneously published on Amazon.com, Dragon Views and LibraryThing.
1594488843|4.0|DRIVE, Daniel Pink's scientific exploration of what motivates us, is paradoxically surprising and yet obvious.  On the one hand, he takes apart the old notion of carrots and sticks, top to bottom.  That is: rewarding people for working and punishing them for not working (what he calls \\"if/then\\") is not a fact of business life.  It's not a fact of education life, either.  It is, in fact, a myth* (the asterisk is that it sometimes holds true for boring work you can do by rote, but when it comes to heuristic tasks requiring any degree of creativity, forget it).<br /><br />As examples, Pink points to Microsoft's now-defunct encyclopedia, Encarta.  Here we had one of the best and most spectacularly wealthy corporations in the world paying writers top dollar to produce an encyclopedia for profit and it folded.  What beat it?  Wikipedia -- an encyclopedia written for free (and available for the same price) by regular folks the world over, people driven by their own interest in the topic and the feelings of accomplishment they enjoyed by seeing their handiwork on-line.<br /><br />Consider, too, Sweden's experiment in switching from a voluntary blood donation program to a pay-per-pint system.  Donations actually dropped.  Why?  Donors actually preferred the feeling they got from giving out of the goodness of their own hearts versus collecting a few bucks (or kronan, should I say).<br /><br />Then there's the childcare pick-up example.  Some parents were late to pick up Johnny and Suzy, which was a pain for the caregivers who had to hang around until the hand-off could be safely made.  So they went to a penalty system wherein parents had to pony-up extra cash for every 15 minutes they were late.  It actually INCREASED parental tardiness.  Why?  In the \\"before,\\" scenario, parents did their best to be on time out of concern for the caregivers who sacrificed by staying later.  In the \\"after\\" scenario, parents felt as if they were simply buying the right to be late -- a cost they were willing to make, now that the \\"human\\" element had been replaced by calculations of cold cash on a ledger.<br /><br />On to the obvious part: people value intrinsic rewards over extrinsic.  Again and again, Pink proves that people will work for less money if they feel a deeper sense of enjoyment and personal fulfillment from their work.  What they need, in a three-bullet nutshell, is autonomy, mastery, and purpose.  Some corporations \\"get it\\" and have thrown out the \\"old-school Edsels\\" of carrot-and-stick, watch-over-their-shoulders management styles.  But many still have a lot to learn.<br /><br />The back of the book provides a handy chapter-by-chapter summary along with talking points for cocktail parties (ha).  Pink also summarizes the gist of this book on the famous TED website.  This book simply explicates in greater detail.  For business types, it's an eye opener.  For educators, too, there are lessons to glean.  Our schools, no surprise, are built on the old carrot-and-stick models as well.  Is it that scary to give the kids more autonomy, show them the value of mastery, and provide them with a purpose?  Teachers need to provide the tools and act as mentors to help create this type of atmosphere.<br /><br />If you're a blank slate in the psychology of motivation, you owe yourself a drive through this book.  It might just change your approach, not to mention the way you view your own life and future.now that the \\"human\\" element had been replaced by calculations of cold cash on a ledger.

B004KPQK2S|5.0|Let me just say first of all I was skeptical. I was. I was going to buy it but since it didn't seem to do that well at the theater I didn't. I had some free Amazon codes for Video on Demand so I figured why not? It's basically free - WOW can I tell you how sorry I am that I didn't buy it? VERY SORRY. EXTREMELY SORRY! This movie starts a little slow but you need the back story to get it. Then watching it once it takes off - OMG! Now any movie based on a real person, animal or event you kind of know what the outcome is but you don't care - you get caught up in it. You cheer for the horse, for the woman breaking out of the Donna Reed/June Cleaver kind of role that life thrusted on women at that time, just WOW - AWESOME movie!!! Should have been nominated for Best Actress Oscar and Best movie!
B004AHNIGM|4.0|First off Gregg's voice has not sounded this smooth and clear in years, but I think the bass is a little to muddy.

0439023491|5.0|The Hunger Games was recommended to me by someone who enjoyed Twilight - \\"it's really good, Dad\\" - so imagine my surprise when Suzanne Collins's coming-of-age-while-under-duress novel turned out to be the best book I've read in the past year.<br /><br />STORY<br />In the post-apocalyptic nation of Panem, an annual tournament is held in which two dozen teenagers must fight to the death. All citizens of this dictatorship are forced to watch the prolonged spectacle - often lasting for weeks - on live TV. I expected the motivations behind this premise to be silly, but, in fact, the leadership of the country used a brutal logic in devising these games, and one I totally bought into.<br /><br />Contestants are chosen by lottery, and in this starving world, teenagers must acquire lottery tickets in order to obtain the meager rations of food needed to keep their families alive. (Let me just say here, that although this is perhaps the most depressing premise I've ever read, the story itself is uplifting, if anything. Don't be put off by this.) When sixteen-year-old (or seventeen . . . it isn't important) Katniss Everdeen's twelve-year-old sister is chosen in the lottery, Katniss steps up to take her place. A boy her age, Peeta Mellark, is also chosen from Katniss's district and a mild, star-crossed romance develops between those two (according to the rules, only one of the twenty-four contestants can survive). However, most of this story's focus is on survival.<br /><br />About a third of this book covers the preparations and ceremony leading to the games, and the other two-thirds cover the tournament itself. This novel is a stay-up-till 2AM page turner from start to finish.<br /><br />VOICE<br />The novel is written in first person, present tense narrative. You won't find a lot of dialogue, but the pace is swift and the story gripping. The author provides enough information to pull you into every scene. She paints a good picture, but doesn't go overboard. I believe I might read another of her novels just for her voice alone.<br /><br />CHARACTERIZATION<br />Characterization is outstanding. We come to learn everything about Katniss during this tournament and, through her eyes, the many other contestants in the games, the organizers, and her two main supporters. These are all unique, interesting characters. Katniss is a great heroine - likeable from the first page and rising to something approaching sainthood by the end.<br /><br />BUY THIS BOOK!read another of her novels just for her voice alone.<br /><br />CHARACTERIZATION<br />Characterization is outstanding.

B004LP3AYI|5.0|Great book, there are, however, some issues with the current Kindle edition. It is entirely lacking in chapter placemarks, and an entire section of text that belongs just before chapter 65 is instead placed at the very end of the Kindle edition. The lack of chapter markers are hardly a significant bother, and the section of misplaced text is not a terribly important segment.

0553381687|5.0|The first book in the series A Song of Ice and Fire, A Game of Thrones tells the tale of the Starks of Winterfell, their allies, and their enemies. Narrating the perspectives of many individuals, the reader quickly becomes engrossed with the characters, compelled by love or hate, attachment or aversion. George Martin upsets and exceeds expectations. He oftentimes troubles the reader by abandoning typical story lines of heroic triumph and the expulsion of evil to the effect that the reader only becomes more emotionally engaged. Martin created a brilliant page-turner, combining fantasy, political intrigue, and historically inspired fiction in novel ways.<br /><br />A unique work of interconnected lives, reborn legends, and the rise and fall of power, this is a book that redefines the fantasy genre, seamlessly integrating fantastical elements into the actualities of life and death, betrayal and trust, victory and defeat. It is a story not soon to be forgotten, demonstrated by the fact that HBO has made its own adaptation. The end of this work is only the beginning and readers will certainly be ready for more.

B00000F14B|5.0|No, this film won't be everyone's cup of tea -- but if you're sick and tired of all the sex, violence, and crude language in today's so-called \\"family\\" entertainment, this delightful movie is perfect for a rainy day or relaxed evening with the whole family -- Robert Preston is magnificent as \\"Professor\\" Harold Hill, the silver-tongued purveyor of non-existent musical instruments -- He's a flim-flam man whose reputation preceeds him.<br /> Shirley Jones as the lovely Marian, the rather virginal librarian, and the late Buddy Hackett as the loyal sidekick.<br /> The movie has something for everyone -- with a great part played by a very young Ron Howard (you might remember him as \\"OPIE\\" on the Mayberry,RFD series. This movie was made BEFORE the Mayberry series, so you see Ron Howard in his very first feature film, and the Technicolor shows off Ron's fiery-red hair -- eat your heart out, Justin Bieber !!<br /> Anyways, it's a great theatrical experience that you can enjoy right in your living room !!<br /> Don't forget the popcorn !!!
B003EYVXUU|4.0|If this was my first introduction to this story I probably would have given it 5 stars, but because it's remaking such a recent film (2009's Let the Right One In), my heart still lies with the original. This version is actually very similar in a lot of ways (the boy chosen as the lead character is almost eerily similar to the boy in the original), and it is BEAUTIFULLY shot and acted, but there was something a little more real to the relationship between the children in Let the Right One In. I would absolutely recommend this film, but if you had to pick between the two, I'd lean a bit more towards the Swedish rendition.<br /><br />Book was great too!

B0023SDQB2|5.0|Regeneration, the first novel in Pat Barker's Regeneration trilogy, examines both the trauma men face in war (specifically World War I with trench warfare and events like the Battle of the Somme) and how others struggle to help those victims. Most of the novel takes place in Craiglockhart hospital in Edinburgh, a hospital for patients who have are struggling with the mental side effects of war, such as nightmares, hallucinations, inability to speak, and so forth.    Regeneration is a historical novel, something I realized 50 pages in. The novel's characters are both real and fictitious. Siegfried Sassoon, Wilfred Owen, Dr. Rivers, Robert Graves, and other secondary characters are real. Others like Billy Prior and Sarah Lumb are fictional. The novel has two central plots, although it jumps around between the characters at times. First, Sassoon writes a letter which outlines why he opposes WWI. The second follows Dr. Rivers, one of the main doctors at Craiglockhart who treats Sassoon and the other patients.    Regeneration is a well written and thoughtful novel. The numerous dialogue scenes are my favorite, because of how natural and revealing some of the conversations are. Beyond that, I think the characters are emotional and likable and the themes are well developed and incorporated into the story as the narrative progresses. There were one or two short scenes which seemed too out of place and weird to me. However, I overall thoroughly enjoyed this novel. Sassoon's relationship with the military and his reflections and thoughts on the war is fascinating. Rivers's struggle to treat his numerous patients and how he examines masculinity, femininity, and healing is well thought out. As an anti-war novel, Regeneration is effective in how the characters reflect on their experiences. Although there isn't one single scene which takes place in France, in the trenches, the characters still remember what they saw. While the novel focuses on how these men are trying to recoverfrom their mental scars, it also focuses on the fact that all of the soldiers will have to return to the trenches as soon as they are able to.    It should be emphasized again that Regeneration is the first novel in a trilogy ([[ASIN:0140257683 The Regeneration Trilogy: \\"Regeneration\\", \\"Eye in the Door\\", \\"Ghost Road\\"]]). The story is continued in [[ASIN:0452272726 The Eye in the Door]] and the Booker Prize winning [[ASIN:0452276721 The Ghost Road (William Abrahams)]]. While Regeneration is to some extent a self-contained story, it is by no means complete. In fact, certain characters and subplots aren't even finished. As for the ones which feel more resolved, there is still a \\"...Then what happened?\\" feeling, perhaps more-so than some other series, due to the fact that some of the characters are real and their story isn't over. This by no means lessens my opinion of the novel, but it is worth pointing out. I have not read the next two novels but plan to shortly.
B004F69J0M|4.0|You can't really call it a comeback, because Gregg never left the scene, but Low Country Blues is a new high point for this veteran artist.  If you are looking for a Southern boogie or jam band album, Low Country is not for you, but if you are looking for genuine blues at it's most passionate and authentic, then Low Country is THE album.  I've been listening to it non stop for a week and still can't get enough; and from the looks of it, I'm going to have the blues for a few more weeks.  At first I thought, even though this is great, it's possibly a little too one dimmensional, but the more you get into it, the more you feel the depth and soulfulness these prescious grooves contain, and the uniqueness of each track reveals itself.    This is a great album for the vinyl format.  Rounder did a wonderful pressing, and the vinyl contains 2 bonus tracks and a download card (although strangely mine downloaded in .WAV format).  I'm sure the CD sounds fine, but there's just something \\"right\\" about seeing this platter spin on the turntable while being taken back to a smoky blues joint way back in the sticks of Georgia or the south side of Chicago, which is exactly where this incredible record transports you.    Allman interprets these blues classics like he was born to sing them, and the liner notes by Robert Gordon gives us a fascinating insight into this, but the sole Allman-written song is a CLASSIC too!  \\"Just Another Rider\\" (featuring Greg's trademark B3 organ) will no doubt take it's place among Allman classics, and most likely be played live by the Brothers.  This sounds like the impassioned Allman from the \\"Fillmore East\\" days.  T- Bones' production is defintely not everyone's cup of tea, but it really sounds right for this album and these musicians, and what a great group of musicians T Bone has enlisted, most notably Doyle Bramhall and Dr John, who deliver one great performance after another.  The horns and backup vocals also add a great element to the record, mainly because they are not overdone and gimmicky, which I thought was a slight flaw with the Elton/Leon record.  If you have a turntable or are debating spending the extra $$ to have this on vinyl, I say, Go for it.  You will not be dissapointed.
B000KJT8IG|2.0|best movie ever!  as soon as i realized that this was on blu ray, i immediately purchased it in december.  i know this is an old movie, but the quality was horrible.  very grainy.  not blu ray quality.  the regular dvd is about the same quality.  disappointed.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|To preface this review: I am the husband of the logon owner, i.e.; I am NOT Suzy! I purchased this set as a belated Christmas present for myself.  Unlike many of the other reviewers, who have depth of knowledge of early recording techniques and equipment, and the original song arrangements and engineers who made it all happen, I'm just your average older white guy who loved the Beatles from the first time I heard them in the early '60s. Having owned most of the early Beatles' albums, and having performed most of those songs in a 1960's-era rock band, I was thrilled at the prospect of owning those albums again, only in a modern format. Upon receiving the set, I opened each CD sleeve and examined everything. I was pleasantly surprised to see that these are the ORIGINALS; the UK-issued versions, rather than the US-issued albums. That being said, as I played them I was a little off on my anticipation of song order on some of the albums, as they are different from the US versions I owned when I was young. Nothing too tragic there, as the lyrics came to mind just about as quickly as in the days when I would sing them on stage! And, listening to them in our Hyundai Genesis, with 440 watts of power and 17 surround-sound speakers, was much more fun than on the old console \\"Hi-Fi\\" stereo our family had in my younger days. For those of you, like me, who've only experienced the US-issued albums of the '60s, this is real treat, to listen to the original UK versions, remastered for today's advanced equipment. Although some of the background noise and chatter is not as audible on a newer, sophisticated stereo system as it was on the old monophonic equipment, I can still hear it, and it brings back many happy memories of a time when all the world seemed more innocent and free. Any true Beatles music fan will thoroughly enjoy this set; I highly recommend it. The engineering is superb! And Amazon's price (at the time) was unbeatable.

0439023513|5.0|Alert: spoilers abound.<br /><br />The overall pattern of the Hunger Games series is a familiar one to the genre: an ordinary individual (albeit one with some unordinary talents) is thrown into extraordinary circumstances, faces and overcomes an immediate threat to personal survival that turns into a much broader conflict in which this person plays a central part.  Some of my favorite books or series follow this motif: Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Dune, Ender's Game, Star Wars, the Hyperion series, His Dark Materials ... the list goes on and on.  It is much easier to begin such a series than it is to end one.  The beginning is easy, because the scope is smaller: a compelling mystery or situation, an enigmatic or charismatic hero or heroine, a seemingly insurmountable menace ... it all makes for good drama, pregnant with potential promise, with the details to be filled in later.  A successful ending is much harder, and even amongst the works I listed earlier, some were able to achieve a successful ending better than others.  This is because by the end of such works, the scope has enlarged, the world is bigger: for an author, it is easy for plot lines to spiral out of control (the post-Ender's Game trilogy and the finale of His Dark Materials come to mind) or for the ending to seem too implausibly 'pat', too \\"happily ever after\\" to do justice to the difficult journey trekked by the characters we grew close to.  And yet, it is safer for an author to hew to the latter course, as there is something innately human about the desire to root for the \\"one man against the universe\\" who triumphs over all odds, beats the bad guy, and gets the girl (or boy) and the gold too, as improbable as it might be.  That's why we love action movies, even though most deserve the caveat \\"as long as you don't think about it too much ...\\"<br /><br />This is why I loved Mockingjay, and found Suzanne Collins' ending to this series to be a remarkably brave choice.  The \\"easy way out\\" was starkly apparent: Katniss could have saved Peeta (in a unique twist on the 'damsel in distress' motif--I must say, I found the choice of a female protagonist to be remarkably smart on Collins' part and refreshing for the genre), killed the bad guy, and they all could have lived happily ever after (with the man of her choosing).  On some level, that might have still been a satisfying ending.  But Collins' aim is to raise questions, strip assumptions bare, and leave the reader burned and bothered about the fundamental nature of reality, and of war most specifically.  Actions have lasting repercussions, wounds and fear do not simply fade away during the chapter break.  For me, the fact that Katniss attempts to run away from her demons makes her extraordinarily real.  She has been beaten, stabbed, shot, blown up, poisoned, and tortured; she has killed and watched her closest friends and family be tortured and killed, while bearing responsibility at least in part for these actions; she has endured the genocide of her people.  If this did not break her, how could she still be considered human?  I would ask the critics who wished for a more stoic Katniss what they would have done in her shoes.  Particularly given that the weight of Katniss' burden becomes increasingly weighty as Mockingjay continues and it becomes more and more clear that the liberators are fundamentally little different from the oppressors; a new regime under Coin would be no better--and perhaps worse in some ways--than one under Snow.  One might be able to tolerate the pain and death if one believed it would lead to a brighter future, but this does not seem to be true had District 13 become the new masters of Panem.  The \\"mission to kill Snow\\", which would have ended in the predictable 'triumphant victory of good over evil' in the hands of a less-skilled author quickly became a brilliantly perverse mockery of this trite motif, as it quickly becomes clear that Coin has sent Katniss to die along with some otherpeople Coin viewed as a threat (all while keeping the cameras rolling for usable shots of 'the martyrdom of the Mockingjay').  The manner of Prim's death is also particularly heartbreaking, as is the realization that the revolution is really just the Hunger Games on a larger scale--whether orchestrated by Snow or by Coin, there is only one winner (and it is most decidedly not the superficial \\"winning tribute\\" of the Games).  Both Snow and Coin's manipulation of reality, through propaganda and the use of the Hunger Games and the revolution as \\"reality TV\\" was also chilling, resulting in the need for the main characters to constantly question what was 'real' and what was 'not real': made up for the games, or the propaganda, or the war.<br /><br />As a reader, that moment when Katniss shifted her arrow, sending Coin to her death, was cathartic.  She chose a 'third way' of sorts, a choice that meant true freedom and liberation for Panem (even if it potentially meant her own death).  Even in this moment, Katniss has likely been manipulated (by Snow, and probably even more importantly by Paylor, whose decision to let Katniss speak to Snow set the final events in motion ... and resulted in Paylor assuming the presidency).  Yet, at worst, this 'manipulation' served to fully reveal the truth, allowing Katniss to make a true, fully-informed choice.  As if to validate the rightness of this choice, the book ends with the indication that a 'new normal' has been created, one more hopeful than could have been possible under either Snow or Coin.  True to form, the wounds remain; yet, life goes on.  Through her sacrifice and pain, Katniss has created a better world for the next generation; she has also chosen (wisely I believe) the partner with whom together they can make each other whole.  The dynamic between Katniss and Peeta was one of the most important and interesting aspects of the entire series, so personally I found it gratifying to see them together at the end, starting a new family (although even this slight nod to convention was tempered by the need to explain their nightmares and roles in the days of Capitol rule to their children).  A more subdued and melancholy ending than is typical for this genre, but one that is ultimately true to its characters and the situations they faced: \\"happy ever after\\" is for the 'propos' and Capitol newscasts, not reality.  Not understanding this fact would make us little better than the viewers in the Capitol watching the Hunger Games for entertainment, seeing the individuals not as people but as 'characters' there to simply give us a good show.  Collins expects and demands more of us.<br /><br />After a long and painful journey, a satisfying, if bittersweet, ending to an emotional, intelligent, and wonderful series that I look forward to going back and re-reading at some point in the future.  The Hunger Games series more than met my expectations and has gone down as one of my all-time favorite series that I can highly recommend to others.  5 stars, easily.wed as a threat (all while keeping the cameras rolling for usable shots of 'the martyrdom of the Mockingjay').

As a reader, that moment when Katniss shifted her arrow, sending Coin to her death, was cathartic.  She chose a 'third way' of sorts, a choice that meant true freedom and liberation for Panem (even if it potentially meant her own death).  Even in this moment, Katniss has likely been manipulated (by Snow, and probably even more importantly by Paylor, whose decision to let Katniss speak to Snow set the final events in motion ... and resulted in Paylor assuming the presidency).  Yet, at worst, this 'manipulation' served to fully reveal the truth, allowing Katniss to make a true, fully-informed choice.  As if to validate the rightness of this choice, the book ends with the indication that a 'new normal' has been created, one more hopeful than could have been possible under either Snow or Coin.  True to form, the wounds remain; yet, life goes on.  Through her sacrifice and pain, Katniss has created a better world for the next generation; she has also chosen (wisely I believe) the partner with whom together they can make each other whole.  The dynamic between Katniss and Peeta was one of the most important and interesting aspects of the entire series, so personally I found it gratifying to see them together at the end, starting a new family (although even this slight nod to convention was tempered by the need to explain their nightmares and roles in the days of Capitol rule to their children).  A more subdued and melancholy ending than is typical for this genre, but one that is ultimately true to its characters and the situations they faced: \\"happy ever after\\" is for the 'propos' and Capitol newscasts, not reality.  Not understanding this fact would make us little better than the viewers in the Capitol watching the Hunger Games for entertainment, seeing the individuals not as people but as 'characters' there to simply give us a good show.  Collins expects and demands more of us.    After a long and painful journey, a satisfying, if bittersweet, ending to an emotional, intelligent, and wonderful series that I look forward to going back and re-reading at some point in the future.  The Hunger Games series more than met my expectations and has gone down as one of my all-time favorite series that I can highly recommend to others.  5 stars, easily.
0060558121|5.0|American Gods starts small, but the ending is epic.<br /><br />Having served three years in prison for aggravated assault, Shadow gets out of jail a few days early when his wife dies. On his way home to the funeral, he meets a man named Wednesday, who enlists Shadow's services as bodyguard, gopher, and servant.<br /><br />This is no small task, considering that Wednesday is Oden, the All-Father, a god whose had quite enough of being forgotten. Oden is a con and an egomanic whose own quest addresses a question raised early in the book: Why is it immigrants to the US so easily left behind the gods of their homeland when they arrived? What is the connection between belief and place?<br /><br />These questions lead to the questions of what we call god, what we believe, and how we live what we believe as Gaiman's characters cross America in this and the underworld as well as the cultures that define and redefine it every minute of our days.<br /><br />In the end beliefs consume us if we let them.<br /><br />In the end, if we don't, welcome to our world.<br /><br />Gaiman had me with Shadow every inch of he way. Brilliant characterization, a fantastic and wholly believable plot, and prose that countless other Kindle readers (like me) found worth highlighting and sharing come together to tell the story of America. In the end what is ordinary is extraordinarily beautiful. Because it is.
B002C2XXJY|5.0|I am a 40-year-old music lover who doesn't have any patience for most pop music, of any era.  I like all kinds of genres from blues to classical, but my real favorite is progressive rock.  I am a card-carrying fan of The Mars Volta and Yes.  So why am I reviewing a Demi Lovato album that my daughter owns?  Because it is simply wonderful, taken as a pop album.  It has flavorings of all the musical genres I mentioned above and more.  Most pop singers are either mediocre or are very good singers in the American Idol sort of mold.  Demi Lovato is something quite out of the ordinary.  Her voice is the most exciting and fascinating I have heard in decades, possibly since I first heard Jon Anderson many moons ago.  She can present herself in so many styles it is amazing.  Her chesty high alto and even soprano notes give me a chill every time with their golden thin tone, uncommon steadiness and raw power.  There's not much head voice around here unless she's going for soft notes, and \\"autotune\\" is used sparingly for certain electronic effects only.
B00127RAJY|2.0|There were areas I really liked about the program, especially the strength training and core exercises that I've incorporated into other areas of my fitness routine, but overall it was very hard on my joints, especially my knees, for which I'm still paying.  I don't normally write reviews of products, but I felt I needed to for anyone out there that may have weak knees/joints so that they would think twice or at the very least take precautions (that I obviously didn't) before doing the program.  I believe another reviewer mentioned modifications for knees (padding, especially during the modified push ups) which should be heeded.  I hadn't done high impact exercise for a while and I should have thought twice before \\"jumping\\" right in.  My knees and I will be doing low impact from now on.

Ask Monica Lewinsky about that.
B003Y8YXGM|4.0|Coming out from his infamous \\"Lost Weekend\\" period in Los Angeles, John Lennon returned to New York with a batch of songs and renewed focus. From that wellspring came \\"Walls and Bridges,\\" Lennon's first album to contain a solo number one single. I know a lot of Lennon fans characterize this album as one of Lennon's weaker albums; I happen to have a certain nostalgic love for it.<br /><br />After all, Lennon had befriended Elton John and Elton famous bet Lennon that \\"Whatever Gets You Through The Night\\" would be a chart-topper. This being 1974, Elton was at one of his peak periods and it's his piano and backing vocals that propelled the song. Lennon lost the bet and the payoff was to be a guest at Elton's Madison Square Garden show, which infamously was Lennon's last live appearance and the duo performing \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" eventually appear as the B-Side to Elton's \\"Philadelphia Freedom.\\" The album also contains the one time John and his son Julian appeared together on record, as Julian plays drums with his dad as the album closes on the oldie \\"Ya Ya\\" (which John eventually recorded for inclusion of the \\"Rock 'n' Roll\\" album).<br /><br />Even with these touching moments, Lennon had compiled some wonderful songs. \\"Number 9 Dream\\" is a mystical, hallucinatory dream diary where Lennon took words and thoughts from dreams and formed them into a nugget of psychedelia. \\"Scared,\\" which opens with a lone wolf howl, is emotionally naked and can't be seen without the backdrop of his separation from Yoko. Nor can the stark \\"Nobody Loves You When You're Down and Out,\\" which also bares its soul in a Dylanesque manner.<br /><br />\\"Walls and Bridges\\" was the final album of original material from Lennon until \\"Double Fantasy\\" with Yoko six years later. While it was the last of Lennon's solo written albums, it often lost. With such open and autobiographical songs as \\"Going Down on Love,\\" the bitter \\"Steel and Glass\\" (allegedly written about Lennon's disgust with Allan Klein) and even the jubilation of \\"Whatever Gets You Through The Night,\\" it deserves better.n of \\"Whatever Gets You Through The Night,\\" it deserves better.

B001W63DX2|5.0|While I cannot say I am a true Maiden fan any longer, I really liked this DVD.  Seeing Bruce flying the band to each new location, watching Steve Harris autographing pictures on the plane, then seeing the band playing golf or sight seeing, is what makes this band so different.  After 30 (god has it been that long) years, they still are only interested in giving their best to their fans.  You will not see a bunch of overweight drunken junkies in this film, but a band who somehow has stayed clean throughout their career (same cannot be stated about their original Lead Singer).  Well worth the buy even if you are (like me) a larger fan of Maiden's work with Dianno than with Dickinson.

It contains a mousepad, that looks like the carpet taken from the Rich Lebowski, a coffee mug with a quote from Walter \\"I'm staying finishing my coffee\\", a magnet that says the Dude Abides, a patch that says The Dude,  an Instruction Book that contains information about how these items were used in the movie, including how to make a White Russian, and my sons favorite item, the severed toe. It was a great gag gift. My 17 year old son actually gives it 7 stars.

B000002J1Y|5.0|I listened to this albums many many times as a teenager in the 70's. Ok now I'm an old guy.     When I saw yes perform in 1977 at Colt Park in Hartford, they opened with Siberian Khatru. And it sounded just as it does on Yessongs. Starship Trooper, Yours is No Disgrace, all were perfect and beautiful.    All the rest of the songs on this album really do sound as the group sounded in it's prime, at the time. I saw them many times, but Colt Park was the best - It must have been the lasers...    This is a really fantastic album. If you like this music or a fan, this is an album you will enjoy.

B004L3AR0K|3.0|I had read an article once in which Baz Luhrmann said that the trick to making his extravagant musicals is to take the most simplistic story and to animate it with songs and sets, thereby giving it oomph and life.    It seems that Hollywood romantic comedies these days function with similar criteria in mind: take the most simplistic story of a boy-meets-girl-falls-in-love-with-girl-because-the-girl-doesn't-love-him-back and set it in extraordinary circumstances. The trend seems to necessary extend to including the characters that must have something grand to fight for and to have love conquer it all. In Love and Other Drugs, Edward Zwick, the director of legendary TV shows thirtysomething and My So-Called Life (and my personal favorites Relativity and Once and Again) asks his characters to have the kind of love that battles Parkinson's disease.    Although it's noble and wonderful to have this huge emotion of love be the cure for diseases and the reason for world peace, it seems that the French have it better. The French romantic dramedies aren't about saving the world, one relationship at a time; instead they are about characters that most resemble real people, people who have the smallest problems and the smallest inclinations for a sliver of happiness. In non-Hollywood cinema, the story hardly needs to be grand, the only criteria is that the audience cares for the characters.    Unfortunately, it's very hard to truly care for the characters of Zwick's latest film, the script for which was adapted from Jamie Reidy's Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman. Even though it takes two hours to tell their story, the viewer hardly knows who these characters are and is instead told to believe that they go through this momentous transformation by having met each other.    The characters are poorly written and the actors who portray them struggle to bring their characters the honesty and the veracity that the storyline demands. Anne Hathaway is quite impressive, butoften too much like her The Devil Wears Prada character, as a 26-year-old girl battling Parkinson's disease while trying to go about her daily life. In the end, Hathaway, who plays Maggie Murdock, an attractive, careless free spirit who doesn't have the freedom from her disease or from her unrealistic expectations of herself, doesn't elicit more than a forethought.    Jake Gyllenhaal is Jamie Randall, a drug rep set on sleeping with anything that has the necessary female body parts. Gyllenhaal has never been sexier than in his role here but he is still short of being a convincing leading man. Gyllenhaal, whose talent is unquestionable (watch Donnie Darko, The Good Girl or Proof for a showcase of his acting skills), doesn't fit the role of a sly, sex maniac, and failed med student who uses hard sell techniques to get laid. In fact, I would almost be inclined to say that Gyllenhaal was miscast in his part here.    Zwick's direction is ever-present. In one scene, Anne Hathaway squats and then leans across to Gyllenhaal, who is sitting in the bathtub. One can just see the director handing out directions of lean left, lean right, don't forget the audience is looking this way in that scene. That's one of the many instances in the film where the action feels unnatural - too staged, too rehearsed, too tried-and-true.    Except for some (arguably unnecessary) nudity between the leads, the too-tired-and-true routine is the story of the film, i.e., there's nothing new in the film that would add to either the genre of romantic dramedy or to Zwick's already extensive career list of adult romantic movies.    The film is set in 1996, and sadly, it doesn't seem that Edward Zwick has ever left that era.
B00000099Y|2.0|Aenima by Tool is a heavy metal cd. The lyrics are about lots of things in life. Things that are not necessarily mainstream - however the sale of this cd has reached mainstream numbers. So in that sense it is a very mainstream cd even though I find the lyrics to have a very underground quality about them. Song number 7 on this cd is called \\"Hooker with a penis\\" for example. The graphics on the cd cover symbols both light and dark. I guess the only way to label this cd would be call it an experience.

B00461BQC0|3.0|Kings of Leon - Come around Sundown has one great song \\"The End\\" (01). I guess it reminds me of the song by the Doors, 1967 with the same title \\"The End.\\"  The song by Kings of Leon seems to reach right down into my soul. When I listen to this song I feel hopeful and soothed. I think it is like a soft lullaby. It is not in the lyrics but in the instrumental make-up. The song portrays peace and serenity. I feel like the light color yellow morning sun coming up close to the ocean. The warmth of a new day. The closure of an old. Their album cover portrays the feeling I feel when I listen to \\"The End\\" the best.

A friend showed me this version on DVD, and I realized that there was a significant improvement over what I had. Then, I bought a Blu-ray player, and figured I might as well order the Blu-ray version . . . It is stunningly beautiful! The clothes have patterns, the skin colors seem much more accurate, and there are many more eye \\"glimmers\\" that weren't visible in the remastered DVD. Even if you own P&P already, get the newest version, and if you have a Blu-ray player, get the Blu-ray version. It's ABSOLUTELY work it!

Its not just a lesbian movie, Its a beautiful love story. This movie grabbed my attention from the very beginning and I journeyed with total belief of everything that went on. The actors were very classy and believable. I was right there at their side. I felt the yearning of their soul wanting to unite as one, and the turmoil that stood in-between. The struggles with family and faith and mostly the sense of duty. Thank you Nicole Conn, Elena Undone Is an important story that needed to be told. Your direction and your vision is makes it all that it is.

B002ZG98C8|5.0|Another movie that was designed to be bad. This movie is patterned after the other Grindhouse type films with nudity, killing, guns, excessive blood, bad acting, bad dialouge, and a plot that doesn't make much sense. In this film Rodriguez thankfully parts way with the Drive-in intermission as well as the fake burning film, and film noise.<br /><br />Danny Trejo, who makes Steve Tyler look like a pretty boy is the main hero is this film. Jessica Alba plays an immigration agent. Steven Seagal, using various bad Mexican accents plays a drug lord. DeNiro is a state senator who, along with his aide is in cahoots with the drug lord as well as a vigilante group along the border. Michelle Rodriquez leads a group of poor Mexicans, all with cell phones.<br /><br />The plot is immaterial. In one scene the car starts on fire before it hits anything...then explodes. Lindsey Lohan goes topless and later dresses in a nun's outfit, packed with a gun. (Plot Spoiler?) She goes to shoot DeNiro, and says, \\"In the name of my father\\" BAM! BAM! then says \\"I forgot the rest.\\" In the end, all alliances break down and everyone tries to kill everyone.<br /><br />Alba is also naked in the shower with her arms and legs strategically placed. She is best in the deleted scenes as her own twin sister which we never see in the movie. Every time Alba comes home she finds her in bed with some guy. Her twin calls her a \\"B\\" word and Alba responds by calling her a \\"slut.\\"<br /><br />There is nothing believable in this movie, nor should we expect it. Oh yes, and the nurses wear very short smocks.<br /><br />There are no orientals in school girl outfits. I wonder how they missed that?
0307592839|5.0|If I didn't know better, I'd say Jennifer Egan and Jonathan Frazen had chatted a bit before embarking on their most recent novels.  Though the outcomes are entirely different, there is a similarity in structure that is striking.  In both novels, there is a periodic switch in narrative voice, where different characters tell the story from their perspective.  Also, both novels move around in time, going forward and back as the narrative voices change.  It is a powerful strategy that can be difficult to pull off.  I first appreciated it in a Thomas Wolfe short story called \\"The Lost Boy\\" which remains one of my favorites.  Both Frazen and Egan pull it off spectacularly and, though I've liked Egan's previous novels well enough, this is an entirely new order of success for her.<br /><br />This is a difficult novel to summarize.  Each chapter tells a unique story that can essentially stand alone, as there is no real interlocking narrative thread.  (In fact, I read two of the chapters as independent pieces in magazines before reading the book.)  And the movement back and forth in time makes it even more difficult to describe.  What holds the stories together are the characters, who we often see at different ages and in different perspectives as different narrators take over in different chapters.  A child mentioned in one chapter becomes the adult narrator of another chapter.  Various high school friends each get their chance to describe a moment of life.  And, as these stories get told, we get a fuller picture of everyone.<br /><br />Egan takes some other stylistic risks as well.  She pushes it a bit with the Power Point presentation and the glimpse of the future in the final chapter; however, she wisely saves these stretches for the end of the book.  By then, it's easier to accept, having already been caught up in the earlier stories.  And even the PPT makes sense in its context.<br /><br />Of course, all of this wonderful stylistic expression would be useless without good stories to tell, and Egan does not disappoint.  We get to look inside the music industry with its art, relationships, and bad behavior.  We get to take an African safari.  We get to search for a lost girl on the streets of Florence, Italy.  We get to try to scrub the image of a murderous dictator.  We get to live in a suburb on the edge of the desert.  All said, we get to have a lot of dirty fun with a lot of interesting people trying to get by.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is a book that, though easy to breeze through, deserves close reading and even rereading.  It is not easy to keep track of all the characters as they appear at different ages and through different eyes.  It's easy to miss vital pieces of information without full attention.  And yet, the pleasures to be gained from the effort are enormous.  It's worth it.Egan does not disappoint.  We get to look inside the music industry with its art, relationships, and bad behavior.

1933492929|3.0|Let me be clear at the outset:  1. I love fantasy art, and I love paleoart.  2. Terryl Whitlatch is clearly a talented artist. Her work reminds me of that of Mauricio Anton and James Gurney. She can do anatomical drawings of extinct, modern, and imaginary animals, draw characters, etc. in a number of styles from the ultra-realistic to the cartoonish.     This book is filled with interesting and delightful art. What I hoped for is some explanation of the thought process behind the drawings. For example, the \\"Pre-Tracker\\" is reminiscent of the extinct predator Andrewsarchus, and has some aspects of the modern wolf, but it has six limbs. It would be nice to know the origin of the concept, what kind of environment was envisioned for that animal, etc.  Also, it would be nice to have some rules of thumb how to make imaginary animals look bizarre, but somehow realistic. Alas, there is none of that here--this book is basically a gallery.     Readers should check out James Gurney's \\"Imaginative Realism.\\"
0786955570|2.0|Potential, but needs house rules.  Written: Feb 05 '11    Product Rating: 2 out of 5 stars       Pros: -quality pieces, varied quests, cooperative    Cons: no strategy, no tactical, repetative combat, annoying encounters    The Bottom Line: Even though this game has potential its not worth it.  There are other games that are more fun.  Under $40? Maybe.      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Full Review:     Castle Ravenloft: A D&D Boardgame     My friends and I bought Castle Ravenloft mainly for the fact that it is a cooperative game where all players work towards an end goal together.  While this is true, the fun factor of the game just isnt there and I will explain why:    First, how the game works.  The game comes with about 30 or so \\"tiles\\" which are cardboard puzzle pieces about 5x5 inches long.  Each of these tiles has a diagram of a hallway, room, or corridor and a grid of squares that is used to measure the movement of your character when exploring.  In this way as you explore you draw from the puzzle pile and attach it to the area you are headed into revealing a new area with new challenges.  So far so good.    The game also comes with an adventure guide that describes what you are supposed to be doing while exploring.  It also has you set up the puzzle pile in certain ways so that the event room that holds the quest is placed \\"after the 8th draw\\" for example.  Additionally it has other factors, some adventures are timed reflecting the sun setting, some have mini boss monsters harass the players, ect. ect.  In this way each time you play there will be some variation.  The adventure guide has some 15 or so different adventures and you are free to create your own.  Still so far so good.    Before you start, you choose a character from one of the five available.  Wizard, warrior, rogue, cleric, and ranger.  Then you select powers from each of their individual decks (which is only approx 8 cards each).  You dontget all the powers, you must select which ones you want therefore further making each game different.  There is also a treasure deck and each player starts with one draw from it.  Most treasure cards are expendable one time use items such as a potion of healing or a blessing that lets you use one of your other one-time use powers again.  As you explore each monster that you kill gives you another draw from the treasure deck, as well as an experience point value based on the monster.  By this point we were very excited to play and had high hopes.    All of the pieces, markers, and cards were of good quality as can be expected from a wizards of the coast product.  My friends and I are not fans of the style of the art, but do recognize its quality.  We chose an adventure and rolled to see who went first and got underway...    Unfortunately from here on out, the game fell terribly short of our hopes that it would be good.  For starters, each time a player explores a new area, a monster card and sometimes an encounter card is drawn.  The games phases state that once you explore a new area you can no longer move or do anything with your character.  This means that the monster(s) that were drawn will always attack first.  This takes strategy out of exploring as the result will always be the same.  Next, if a character does not explore a new area he or she must then draw from the encounter deck and 90% of those cards are detrimental like \\"each player on the tile takes 1 damage\\" or \\"choose a power, you can no longer use that power this adventure\\".  Encounter cards are like anti-treasure cards, negative things that happen.  I dont like that each character that doesnt explore a new area must draw an encounter card because sometimes if you are fighting monsters, you dont want to explore a new area thus revealing more that you will have to deal with and that will attack before you can react.    Eventually the monsters and encounter cards just grind the players down to 0 hit points where they must use one of their 2 healing surges to revive themselves.  If they have no healing surges left, the game ends in a loss.  There is no way to prevent the grind.  There doesnt seem to be any epic successes or failures for either the players or monsters.  The powers mostly just let you hit things further away from you or hit every monster on a tile, ect.  There just isnt enough variation of things to do on your turn.  Its always like \\"I use magic missile.\\" over and over.  Moving even seems pointless since the only factor is whether you explore a new area or not thus having to draw from the encounter deck.    As you gather xp you can spend it to either level up or to cancel an encounter card drawn for 5 points each.  You can only level up once.  After that there is no character progression aside from treasure which is mostly lackluster from what we saw.    In conclusion, we tried the game 2 times after that first time.  Each adventure was different granted, but the constant grind was always the same.  The game has potential!  But in my opinion you must come up with some house rules to make it more strategic and fun.  I suggest:    -when a new monster card is drawn by exploring a new tile roll randomly to see on which players turn the monster acts instead of it always being the explorer's turn    -let players explore new areas on their movement phase so that they can still do something after they explore    -double the hit points of all non-boss monsters to compensate for the above 2 items    -dont force players to draw an encounter card if they attack a monster on their turn and do not explore a new area    Recommended:  No
1439133948|2.0|I'm a long-time fan of Bujold's Vorkosigan series, and was initially thrilled to see her return to those tautly-paced and cleverly written novels of my youth. Sadly, the current offering, Cryoburn, is less of a return to form and more of a curtain-call for characters who are well-past stale and in need of some cryonic revival themselves. Bujold has clearly exchanged her interest in space opera for romantic fiction. As in her recent fantasy novels (and the Vor novel \\"A Civil Campaign\\") the pace of the work is plodding, interrupted by reams of useless verbiage, with emphasis on interstellar domesticity instead of interstellar diplomacy; All the characters talk about now and pine for are loving relationships, pet peeves, family discussions and, oh yes, lots of children.    And that's great, for a romantic fantasy like \\"The Sharing Knife\\", but it's a complete waste of a character like Miles Vorkosigan and it shows in the almost desultory fashion in which plot twists are sprung and then resolved in the course of a chapter or two, with a shrug and a wink by all involved, so that they can get back to sharing maudlin dialogue (and far too much interior monologue) about absent friends, loved ones and how all we really need is a good hug from mommy to make it all right. That last bit might very well be a direct quote from a character, I can't really recall, because around 1/3 of the way through this novel I just started skipping pages of sappy dialogue and POV of a semi-autistic child just to get to the end of the book. That's the worst redefining of a \\"page-turner\\" I've ever seen, so at least Bujold accomplished that much.    To add insult to injury, there's a series of 100-word \\"stories\\" in lieu of an epilogue (Defined by Bujold as a \\"drabble\\") during which all sorts of potentially interesting back-stories and characters who were conspicuously absent here are visited and essentially discarded in what I hope will be written off as a bit of authorial indulgence hopefully never to be repeated in this genre or any other.    Drabble indeed.
B0014YVC6W|5.0|It was a classic movie.  I always enjoy watching this one every once awhile.  Nice to have it in BR.
B002JVWR4U|5.0|I just finished season 2 of Dollhouse and it blew me away! There are so many twists and turns that you never get bored. If you like science fiction/brain control type of stuff, I would definitely recommend this show. The only negative thing I can say about it is that the acting is sometimes lacking from a few of the cast members. Overall one of my favorite series' ever! It really makes you think about where technology is leading us.<br /><br />Also: The character of Topher is fascinating, and to see what he becomes (by watching the extra episodes Epitaph one and two) is heartbreaking.
0321647440|2.0|Probably nice book, but the DVD didn't work: tried on 2 Macs and on 2 PCs, no luck.  Then downloaded the 3,5Gb DMG file from PeachPit, which gave error while mounting. Containted empty files.    Any idea where I can download the image file that works?
B001E8ZZMK|5.0|Really love this musical!  Ethel Merman, Dan Dailey, Donald O'Connor, Mitzi Gaynor & Johnnie Ray, were the primary headliners.  As usual in Hollywood, the sex symbol, Marilyn Monroe, which whom could neither act nor sing ever, had to be included in the story line.  Too bad!  The worst part is, someone spoiled the original image by allowing some production marketing group to decide that the cover art should be MM.  Yuk!  I imagine for more current generation sales purposes.  The original cast cover art is the only production rendition (as shown on this page photo) which rightfully should be used!!  The original cast characters is what the story is all about!  Someone please reinstate the original production art cover.  An important part of musical film history has been marred.  Thank you very much! Dee Harvest

B003EYVXXW|4.0|In \\"Agora,\\" a film depicting the Roman Empire in circa 415 AD, director Alejandro Amenabar presents his audience with screen-filling photo segments of the earth peacefully spinning in the blackness of space to the music of its sphere.  Who would believe that such serenity would reveal, as the camera pans closer and moves through the layers of the earth's atmosphere, a great din of unrest. Cross-wearing mobs have amassed near the Great Library of Alexandria to uphold the Emperor Theodosius's call for the ultimate removal of all things pagan from the face of the Empire he rules.  Turn-the-other-cheek Christians with cudgels and swords will insure the icons of the pagan world fall without but preferably with bloodshed.  As marble statues topple and priceless scrolls of learning burn in a fire inflamed with fear and ignorance, the pagan denizens of the Library realize that the seclusion of their academic lives is forever to change.<br /><br />Most influenced by this is the mathematician, philosopher and cosmologist Hypatia (check out Brian Trent's novel \\"[[ASIN:0595342523 Remembering Hypatia: A Novel of Ancient Egypt]]\\"), who is willing to forego romantic love and a domestic life for her desire to unravel the unknown--she happily spends her time teaching a philosophy of the brotherhood of learning while extensively pondering the mathematics of the earth's trajectory around the sun.  Unfortunately, her egalitarian ideas of understanding through knowledge and gender equality threaten those politically positioned to grab the reigns of power and plunge the world into a dark age of domination without the light of free thought.<br /><br />Rachel Weisz plays Hypatia with a gravitas that brings to life not only her legendary beauty but, her philosopher's love of the truth. Her eyes gaze at a point only she sees bringing an ethereal aura to the otherwise befuddled academic forever preoccupied with theoretical questions the world of science even today has yet to answer. As she fends off three different suitors from three different factions of the city, Weisz, as Hypatia, does a fine job of giving the role a sense of innocence, urgency and impending doom.  Amenabar and Mateo Gil's script allows her to pontificate her idea of a Republic worthy of that of Plato in speeches that underline the seclusion and otherworldliness of her academic life and yet maintain her credibility with a luminous mixture of serenity and dread.<br /><br />As one of her admirers, the slave Davus (Max Minghella) violently embraces the ascendancy of Christian rule over Alexandria, becoming one of the black-robed `parabolani' who patrol the streets armed with crude weapons, sharp tongues and little mercy for the once aristocratic pagans.  Archbishop Cyril (Sami Samir) wants nothing less than the eradication of all paganism and is willing to preach insurgence.  When he targets Hypatia while sermonizing one of Paul's letters to the Corinthians, former students and rationalists Orestes (Oscar Isaac), the Roman Prefect and Synesius (Rupert Evans) Bishop of Cyrene (this is historically incorrect as Synesius actually was the Bishop of Ptolemais) cringe at what they presage as the unavoidable fate of those who choose not to bend the knee to a faith that is swift in gaining governmental control.<br /><br />In his scenes of chaos where the once underdog Christians (think arena with lions) fight for control, Amenabar speeds up the action, giving the audience a buzzard's eye view of the warring participants who scurry along and cluster like ants fighting for crumbs of food and annihilating anything in sight.  Papyrus scrolls dance through the air in a macabre sacrilege across an oculus framing an otherwise bright blue sky; harsher, darker fabrics, black beards and the gleam of knives reflecting sneering eyes portray marauding Christians as fanatical equalizers extinguishing the lantern of learning. The point?  All fundamentalists, no matter what the religious or political persuasion, halt humanity's understanding of the world in which it lives and is content to seize control at the expense of the overall common good.  Perhaps Amenabar as an acknowledged atheist uses his film to make a statement against religion as one of the opiates anesthetizing the masses while control is seized by an elite corps--but history tells us that despots will use religion, politics, racial supremacy, various interpretations of the rights of man or anything else to get ultimate access to power and materialistic gain.<br /><br />Unfortunately, his depiction of Hypatia as an atheist does not ring true.  As a Neo-Platonist, she most likely sought some Gnostic union with the One.  Like many New Agers that profess gnosis of God through meditation, Hypatia probably reveled in her ability to privatize her knowledge of God and attempted to teach her students her \\"path\\" to that understanding.  History records that Cyril was jealous of her popularity and if she was advocating knowledge of God without the communal help and guidance of the Church, it is little wonder that Cyril affixed a target to her being.  Amenabar, being fully aware that most audiences love beauty and put it well before age, takes another liberty: at the time of her death, Hypatia would have been nearing sixty rather than the 30-something that Weisz's fresher visage suggests.  Artistic license allows that which aesthetically pleases and that which will further the theme of the medium.  From the same standpoint, Amenabar's version of the destruction of the Serapeum shows the mob burning books to intensify the end of illuminated thinking.  However the actual event in 391 did not actually involve the burning of books as the Serapeum was used primarily as a temple rather than a library.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Despite some historical inaccuracies, Alejandro Amenabar uses his film \\"Agora\\" to remind us that history does indeed repeat itself with the machinations of the heavy-handed using fear and ignorance to move their cause. Perhaps Amenabar's point as an atheist is that all religion manipulates the masses. Whether it be with a fear of the unknown or unfamiliar or an argument over whose god is better, the fanatical fundamentalist armies championing intolerance destroy progressive thought and stall the overall evolution of mankind in favor of their specific agenda. A stirring musical score by Dario Marianelli thrusts the film towards its grisly conclusion while Rachel Weisz as the philosopher Hypatia quietly spouts rhetoric on the side of the truth and the absolute quest for knowledge. No one in the supporting cast listens and the world goes mad. Recommended with warnings of much violence and a brutal ending.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />\\"reneofc\\"erstanding of the world in which it lives and is content to seize control at the expense of the overall common good.

0920668372|1.0|I can't figure out why so many people love this book.  I think it is great to install the idea that a parent's love is unconditional and forever but there a million other books that convey this message without being creepy.  Let me put it this way.  If my mother-in-law broke into our house in the middle of the night and tried to rock my husband to sleep, I would do one of two things.  I would get her to the doctor to check for senile dementia or I would get a restraining order against her.  Luckily, my mother-in-law is a lovely lady who would never do that.  I also feel that it gives the message that you are not OK with your child growing up and becoming their own person. There is a Norman Bates quality to the whole thing.  Skip this book and get \\"Guess How Much I Love You.\\" It has the same theme without the weirdness.
B002VPE1AW|2.0|Claptrap.  Preach non-violence for two hours and then resolve the main conflict through an orgy of violence.  Do as we say, not as we do.    The special effects were pretty good.  The \\"Star Wars\\" special effects were pretty good in 1977.  We'll look back on \\"Avatar\\" in a few years and cringe.  A film that has nothing but special effects to recommend it is condemned to a very short life.
B004IM14RY|2.0|This movie is decent right up to the ending. The ending is disappointing, and worth rating this movie so low.
B003R0LBVW|1.0|This was just awful.<br /><br />Luckily, I got it free from the library in audiobook format.  Even with a gifted narrator and the knitting of a glorious vest to keep me going, I just had to stop listening to this drivel.<br /><br />Plot?  The characters were unlikeable and I could not see what the alleged big deal this was.  Maybe it's just an exercise by Oprah to see if she gives her stamp of approval to garbage, the masses will delude themselves to believe it's really potpourri.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|The x41s are probably your best option for Xbox 360 wireless headphones with speech mic capability. You could get better sound from a pair that are not made for Xbox 360, but you would miss out on great features that make these headphones one of the best options.     The malleable boom microphone is built in, fixed to the left ear cup.      The phones aren't completely wireless. They come with a cable (that has a mute switch and volume dial) that connects the headset to the controller, similar to how the stock headset communicator attaches with a cable. I guess the licensing costs of Microsoft's proprietary wireless technology was just too much for Turtle Beach (these fees can be in the millions).   It's not the most elegant solution, but the headset does have other features that make it the best solution.    The best feature of this headset is that it mixes voice chat in with game sound. That means you are not covering up one ear with a headset communicator (I was using Microsoft's wireless unit) and getting monaural sound into your other ear. You get stereo sound with the voice chat mixed into both ear channels. You can adjust the game volume and voice chat volume separately. And microphone fidelity for your fellow games coming from you is very good, probably better than Xbox live is capable of. If it's too loud for them, move the mic away from your mouth. There is no microphone gain to adjust outgoing sound volume for your party.    The sound of the headset is very good. I don't get the whole surround headphones thing- I still feel like they are just good stereo headphones. I do get a sense of when something is happening on the left or right, which is not something I ever felt using my speaker system. I don't think that is unique to this headset. But it is cool when you are playing Battlefield and you hear someone running nearby.    Battery life is pretty good with two AAA batteries. I use rechargeables and they last a reasonably long time. I would imagine that if you like wasting disposable batteries, they would last even longer. The headphones turn themselves off after inactivity, which is critical. I usually just turn them on and when I'm done I just hang them on the stand without powering them down.    I have a wireless router (an old Dell Wireless A/B/G router) about 6 inches from the headphone transmitter, and I have had no real problems because of it.     Caveats:  1)There is a slight background hiss when I power these on. I don't hear it when there is any game sound, and I kind of appreciate it when there's no sound so that I know the headphones are on. Occasionally I get a pop like people complain about, but that hasn't really been a big problem for me.    2)The stand/transmitter is a mediocre design that tends to topple easily unless you put the phones on with care. And at this price point, I can't see why they didn't go with a rechargeable design. However, battery replacement is easy enough. If I played more, I'd probably be able to do it one handed without even taking off the battery cover.    3)I bought these December 17 2010 and on Feb 5 2011 the headset Xbox live talkback cable died- it just produces hiss. Turtle Beach has them on their website for $4.99, which seems reasonable. Unfortunately, the cheapest shipping option is FedEx at $8.35. So 2 months (mind you I don't play all day every day either) in I'm buying a replacement part for $13? It's a cheap cable and it's cheaply made. I'll buy this on eBay or from Amazon for maybe a dollar or two less. Very annoying that $150+ headphones have a cheap cable that breaks so easily. Of course, I'm assuming it's the cable. I have not tried a replacement yet.    I highly recommend these headphones if you are doing online voice chat, although I'm surprised they aren't a totally perfect design at this price point. They are a decent buy at full price, but I was happy to get them a little below, on sale. If you don't do voice chat, buy a cheaper set of wireless cups thatdon't have the mixing technology cooked in, or the high price.
0316069485|3.0|Michael Connelly is one of my favorite mystery writers and I love his early novels starring LAPD detective Harry Bosch and have enjoyed the new series he has started featuring Bosch's half brother Mickey Haller a defense attorney. In THE REVERSAL Connelly puts the two brothers on the same side as Haller switches from defense to prosecution for a single case with Bosch as his lead investigator. The case they are dealing with is that of a murderer who has been imprisoned for twenty-four years but been granted a new trial because of some recently recovered DNA evidence. Rather improbably Haller allows this convicted child killer to be released on his own recognizance even though he is convinced of his guilt and this is just one of the plot points that require the reader to suspend a lot of disbelief even though Connelly comes up with some arguments as to why this is plausible.     The murder victim in the reopened case was a twelve year old girl and both Haller and Bosch have daughters of around that age. Connelly is not particularly successful at developing the father/daughter theme he apparently had in mind. Haller's first ex wife Maggie is second chair, for the prosecution, his second ex wife and office manager is on the periphery and Bosch's ex lover FBI profiler Rachel also weighs in with some advice. All these exes working together should add some romantic tension and interest but somehow they don't. The story alternates viewpoints by chapter between the two brothers with Haller's first person accounts being marginally more readable than Bosch's which are written in third.     The book has few twists and turns and is somehow bland despite the sensational premise. And Connelly never really gives us any insight into why the villain is so villainous which is quite frustrating. He is successful at least in part at vividly rendering Los Angeles and its environs with a well defined sense of place which has always been one of the hallmarks of the Bosch novels. Still THEREVERSAL is certainly not the book to introduce anyone new to Connelly and even some of his fans are not missing much by skipping it.

My heart was literally racing for the last 3 chapters!! I felt so connected to Lena's character, so much so that as soon as I would power on my kindle and pick up reading it almost felt like I became Lena. In my opinion those are the best kind of books. Ones that leave you so emotionally invested that you feel what the character feels. The hard part is going to be waiting until next February to get my hands on the 2nd book! If you have not read this book and you are skimming reviews trying to decide if you should or not PLEASE DO! You wont regret it. This is one of those series that does not come around too often. Its up there in my very small list of favorite reads!
B004EI3ON4|5.0|It's nice to hear a different take on the recent practice of mixing synthesized sounds with acoustic sounds.  Unlike many film composers who use synthesizers pretending to be acoustic instruments (looking at YOU, Hans Zimmer), Daft Punk employed physical orchestral players to accompany (and sometimes replace) their synthesized works.  In many of the tracks, the minimalist \\"loops\\" aren't really loops at all, but actual string performers playing the lines over and over while the brass players blast out thick chords and the percussion hammer out repeated patterns.  I don't know Daft Punk's work, but I like this album.    Side note: In the loud section of \\"C.L.U.\\" (around 2:00), listen for the sustained rattle below the drum beat.  I can't tell for certain, but it sounds like a bass trombone hitting a pedal tone VERY, VERY LOUD (hell yeah), except that it's held for 24 measures- without even the slightest waver in the cycles/second (which also indicates that it's not two trombone players trading off).  My guess is that Daft Punk sampled the bass trombone's pedal note and then looped it; there's no human that can sustain a fortissimo pedal tone for that long.  If I'm right, then kudos to them!

I loved the \\"reality\\" aspects, not only in the difficulty of finding love, but the religious and social undertones of Elena's character.      The directing, film production and acting are top notch!      It's a 10 star rating for me.  Alas, only a 5 star will have to suffice:-(
B000VSBX34|1.0|Sadly, one of my favourite Beatles albums (replete with strong melodic pop) contains the 'soundtrack' to an extremely disappointing cinematographic effort.<br /><br />After the innocent charm of 'Hard Day's Night', hopes were high that director Richard Lester would create another classic Beatles film.<br /><br />But everyone tried too hard, or perhaps, not hard enough. Lacklustre performances from the Beatles themselves (were they really interested?) and the stellar English supporting cast, a flimsy and laboured story, and an embarrassingly unfunny script leaves little to enjoy.<br /><br />For a slice (albeit a contrived one) of early 1960s Beatles life, watch 'Hard Day's Night'. Everything else, until the revealing documentary 'Let It Be' (when will it be released?) that bookended their career was a regrettable waste of time and money.

B000B8QG4A|5.0|My kids ages 11 8 and 3 loved this movie as much as I did when I was a kid.
1439133948|3.0|I looked forward to Cryoburn with a lot of anticipation, having followed Miles joyfully through all of his previous adventures. I was anxious to see how he would mature, and wondering what kind of father he would turn out to be. I was looking forward to hearing the patter of little feet in Vorkosigan House, as well.    Cryoburn gives next to nothing in that regard. Instead, we find Miles alone on a completely unfamiliar world, in an extremely slow starting story that keeps the reader confused and guessing in an uncharacteristic manner for chapter after chapter. Once it finally becomes clear just what is going on, the novel becomes much more fun, and has Miles surprising everyone in true Vorkosigan fashion for a fast paced and upbeat ending.    Cryoburn explores a world where the dead seem to matter more than the living. Life on a planet where people's hope of eternal youth (once science has defeated the aging process, and they are revived from cryostasis) holds some ghastly prospects for the living. Huge corporations control everything for their own profit, while the unemployed struggle simply to survive. Sound familiar?    Miles uncovers some sinister dealings that would have threatened the Barrayaran Empire, and saves the day again. There is a great deal of rollicking adventure here, a wonderful friendship with a young boy, with the social commentary deftly delivered in its midst. However, Ekaterin is completely absent, we learn that Miles' four (yes, four) children are growing up without meeting any of them, and word of the death of Miles' father is tagged on almost as an afterthought. I sincerely hope that Bujold will go back to fill in some of those gaps if the Vorkosigan saga is to continue. For the first time in this series, Cryoburn makes me wonder if Bujold is running out of steam with this character and this world. I hope not.

031265068X|5.0|Is there any prospect as frightening as a political show trial in the court of public opinion?<br /><br />Reading about the 17-year government witch hunt for Marc Rich - the global commodities trader credited with inventing the spot oil market - I was reminded of an old quote attributed to Cicero:<br /><br />\\"A bureaucrat is the most despicable of men, though he is needed as vultures are needed, but one hardly admires vultures whom bureaucrats so strangely resemble. I have yet to meet a bureaucrat who was not petty, dull, almost witless, crafty or stupid, an oppressor or a thief, a holder of little authority in which he delights, as a boy delights in possessing a vicious dog. Who can trust such creatures?\\"<br /><br />In the early 1980s Rich became a prototype for the celebrity show trial, having been accused of 1) the largest tax fraud in history and 2) \\"trading with the enemy\\" through the duration of the Iran hostage crisis.<br /><br />Rich was essentially a star-making vehicle for a fame-hungry prosecutor you may have heard of, Rudy Giuliani, launching the career in politics that followed.<br /><br />For the reader with strong liberterian instincts, the thrust of government overreach in the Rich story is nauseating. The U.S. government tried to pursue Rich by means fair and foul for 17 years, including a kidnapping scheme in blatant violation of Swiss laws. (In refusing to succumb to U.S. bullying, the Swiss government is an unsung hero in this tale.)<br /><br />The bungled extradition attempts came after Giuliani had used RICO, a controversial legal statue designed for mafia cases, to essentially shut down Rich's commodity trading business and extract hundreds of millions of dollars at gunpoint. (Imagine the government freezing your assets and mortally threatening your livelihood before there is any trial - forcing your enterprise to settle or die - and you get the idea.)<br /><br />Rich ultimately left the United States for Switzerland, never to come back, because he feared the sensationalized media treatment (gleefully encouraged by Giuliani and others) would increase his odds of a possible lifetime prison sentence, with prosecutors crowing about 100+ years of jail time and refusing to discuss finer points of evidence.<br /><br />The mind boggles at the mindset necessary for one man to pursue another in such blatant fashion. Another government operative, Ken Hill, spent 14 years \\"solely and exclusively\\" committed to the Rich case, obsessing over the bitter, vindictive image he and other crusaders had created in their own minds. What kind of life could that possibly be?<br /><br />The story as told by the book's author, Daniel Ammann, is unquestionably sympathetic to Rich. But that seems reasonable, based on the evidence presented, and also based on the merciless beating Rich's reputation took in the hands of his detractors. There are many who see him as \\"the biggest devil\\" to this day.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with diligent pursuit of justice, obviously, or upholding the rule of law. What is so off-putting (again from a libertarian perspective) is how selectively the rule of law is applied.<br /><br />In other words, an individual with a show trial profile may be pursued to the ends of the earth because it conveniently fits the image-burnishing goals of the prosecutors - yet at the same time, activities of proven and far greater corruption, covered over through deep complications or access to the Washington power structure, are routinely ignored.<br /><br />There was perhaps nothing so galling, for example, as the trillions of dollars lifted out of taxpayers' pockets in recent years via the global financial crisis - an insider con job orchestrated at such high levels that the public (and the SEC) had zero chance of understanding. The true criminality is embedded in the system itself, and the Giulianis and Weinbergs of the world could care less.<br /><br />The \\"trading with the enemy\\" charges leveled against Richalso seemed gallingly hypocritical. After all, is anyone as actively involved in \\"trading with the enemy\\" as the United States government itself?

0765326353|5.0|Sanderson needs to finish the Wheel of Time and focus on his own superior work the Stormlight Archive, this first book is incredible and so different than standard fantasy. All the characters are interesting and well written, the whole world has huge potential to fill volumes. The only problem with new work like this is waiting years between novels.
1594202842|4.0|I \\"loved\\" this book for a few reasons:   1. It was entertaining. Very funny stories with some heart-felt tender moments as well.  2. I could relate to many of \\"Chinese mom\\" parenting stories.  3. It made me think and talk with others about the book. I've been talking to MANY people, of all walks of life, including my own \\"chinese mother-style\\" parents.    I \\"hated\\" reading this book for a few reasons.  1. It was poorly written. It was disjointed and at times, there was a lot of detail and other times not. The ending was very disappointing.  2. There are many black and white views that are dangerous if taken without understanding and context.  3. It perpetuates stereotypes that some (me included) asians want to break out of.     Bottom line - read this book only if you are willing to be open-minded about it all.

1439156816|2.0|With the hype surrounding this book, I decided to pick it up to see what that was all about. I was told it was a 'must' read.<br /><br />I skimmed through the life sections about King. I don't think he had led a overly exciting life like he sees to think. So that left me with the writing sections.<br /><br />First off, King's advice is his own. It is what works for him. I am a fan but I was saddened to see how he named a couple of books throughout the memoir, mostly by dead authors and bashed them because they didn't write in his style. And when be mentioned backstory I couldn't help but snicker how this man often(very often), writes pages of it throughout his novels.<br /><br />Again, I am a fan but after reading this I cannot help but see him in another light and it isn't good.

0440178002|5.0|Fabulous, vivid and memorable story.If Clavell had aimed higher he could have created a world classic as it is this book really gave me the sense of 'being their' in the medieval mind and culture of both the Japanese and the European. It really imparts the harshness of life and decisions of humans before science that is humans centered around ceremony ,habits ,rituals and religion .From the Japanese side fatalism and ceremony order and from the European side Christian superstitious religious slavery mixed with greed.   The transcendence of the Protagonists  through intelligence and strength of character into realizing the stupidity of his own countrymen , could fit any man in many worlds of history And Clavell has seen it accurately. Yaa its a fun fabulous read.
0312600844|5.0|I'll just add another voice of praise for this superb book. There's no need to be fancy or pedantic: Freedom is a masterpiece. I don't remember ever being so addicted to a book for over a decade, and that's what most important--this book reinstilled in me a love of reading that's lain dormant long enough for me to forget it. I'd forgotten books could be this good, but this one is. It's a wild, dizzying, brutally insightful, wonderfully heartbreaking novel--not enough good can be said about it. Walter Berglund's rise to fall in his final meltdown was one of the most exciting things I've ever read. And though this novel is more literary than other literary works (puts their aspirations to shame, in other words), it also moves along as smoothly as any airport pop lit. Franzen understands people in their conflicting idiosyncrasies too well. The only negative that can be said here is that anything else will pale in comparison. What can be read after Freedom?    The negative reviews are mostly kneejerk contrarians or ad hominem attackers. That is, people don't like the book a) because other people (too many other people) like it, or b) because people don't like Franzen for extremely nebulous reasons, such as he's \\"pretentious,\\" a word that's been so abused and misused as to mean nothing anymore, or that he's a crank, or an elitist, and even if this is true, which not one reviewer negative or positive has any clue of--even if this is true, it doesn't mean that art and artist aren't infinitely separable. They are; they always are.

0061205699|5.0|Somehow I had never managed to read To Kill A Mockingbird until now.  It was the winner of the 1961 Pulitzer Prize and considered an American classic.  I was very worried it would disappoint.    This is one novel that didn't disappoint.  I was gripped from beginning to end.  I knew of the great honorable character of Atticus Finch who defended a black man despite all opposition from his neighbors in a southern Alabama town.    The book is so much more than that.  It is told through the eyes his daughter (nicknamed Scout) and her narration is perfect.  Lee is able to very accurately depict the innocent lens of a child while remaining coherent and eloquent.  Even without the trial and even without the great character of Atticus Finch, this is a wonderful tale of childhood.    Even the character of Atticus is appropriately flawed.  He is a single parent who has trouble raising his children.  He doubts that he's doing the best for him.  His basic goodness shines through but it's never cliched.    I read this in two sittings and enjoyed every moment.  This novel deserves all the rich praise that it has been given.    I give a most enthusiastic recommendation to this classic.

The music captures the feelings of the film perfectly. When I listen to the cd in my car, I can tell what part of the film it went in, because it reminded me of the scene it was in. Soft and romantic, the score is beautiful even if you have not seen the movie. One of my favorite soundtracks ever!

1584282584|5.0|Background (you can skip)<br />Since so many reviews have already been written about this book I will keep this brief with my personal reasons why this book is so useful. I have bought TONS of photography books (at least 35), always looking for useful tips to get that pro look to my photos and extort Oooh's and Aaaah's from people looking at my collection. Lighting has always been my downfall, since I cannot seem to get the contrast, shadows, directions etc right. I bought expensive soft boxes and strobes and yet never learned to properly use them, even with all the books at hand. So I have been steadily looking for books that could give me good useful instruction on how to create positive results that would fuel inspiration (success is great fuel)!! I tried some of the books my pro friends recommended. like Light, science & Magic and found that those were too advanced and required too much skill / experience with some of the equipment (like strobes) to be the best start. And then I found this little 20 dollar lesson.<br /><br />About this book<br />There are a few things that many photography books do that do not work for me:<br />- The are THICK, I mean endless pages going through basics about cameras that I do not need, forcing me to spend too much time reading, which I do not have<br />- They often assume deep wallets, ie. access to expensive equipment<br />- They often assume everyone wants to be a pro-sumer / semi-pro, whereas what I wanted was just darn good looking pictures without excessive knowledge I will rarely use<br />- Most of all, they assume you have tons of space and great lighting equipment.<br /><br />My reality is: I am a father of many kids, I have a busy busy life. I rarely have time to go shoot outdoors. Mostly I take pictures indoors and often in the evenings, but rarely in studio conditions. In fact, my house is cramped so I cannot set up backgrounds and strobes very easily nor do I enjoy it.<br />Reading is something I enjoy with novels, not with photography or instruction books.<br /><br />Here are the reasons why I think this book excels:<br />- It is thin and to the point<br />- I think it immediately gives you USABLE, applicable instructions to take good looking photos, augmented by flash<br />- It understands that not all of us have strobes, studio space and enormous soft boxes.<br />- It focuses on flash photography albeit indoors or outdoors, augmenting natural light or being the main source.<br />- It teaches quickly and efficiently<br /><br />The negative(s):<br />- The first 10 pages are generic detailed scientific explanations of reflection and lighting. Tough material, but after that it gets applied!!<br />- The actual size of the book: it should have been in a little smaller format as this is one you'd want to carry with you.<br /><br />Overall worth EVERY penny you pay for it.Here are the reasons why I think this book excels:  - It is thin and to the point  - I think it immediately gives you USABLE, applicable instructions to take good looking photos, augmented by flash  - It understands that not all of us have strobes, studio space and enormous soft boxes.  - It focuses on flash photography albeit indoors or outdoors, augmenting natural light or being the main source.   - It teaches quickly and efficiently    The negative(s):  - The first 10 pages are generic detailed scientific explanations of reflection and lighting.

B003Q6BQPS|5.0|Got my order of the Winter Bakery shop # 10216  It seems kind of late since it is post Christmas season but please bear with me why I still had this model.    I have noticed that LEGO releases every Christmas season a Winter model series for the past 2 years. My wife likes decorating every Christmas with my daughter and we were contemplating before on getting those miniature Christmas houses/sets that are made of ceramic But since LEGO have these models, I then decided that instead of those ceramics, we will just collect these model series.    It has the following advantages on my point of view.    1. It then let us get together every Christmas to decorate our house  2. It makes my little girl appreciate how to collect and take care of toys properly  3. It also makes her learn how to follow the instructions, at the same time be creative in her own way.  4. It makes us anticipate to assemble it every season and make us wait in anticipation on what will be the new model the next Christmas.    On to the review:  1. Minifigs: 5 adult minifigs (2 Female/3 Males(Baker, Horse carriage driver, Seller of pine trees) 2 kids and 1 lower half body stuck in snow.  I like this very much since it has various features especially 2 who has double sided faces which you can change.    2. Construction:  a. Christmas Tree stall: Simple but with colorful roof and has stickers for the banner of the stall. (Wish it was printed instead)    b. Ice skating area: This I like very much since you can pose the minifigs in different ways.Also the minifigs has ice skates :)    c. Bakery shop: This is the main construction, This occupied a lot of pages on the instruction but it is well worth it. What I like this very much again are due to the nice big windows with \\"plastic\\" glass, swinging door and also the window frames. Nice slanting roof for the second floor and open back for you to pose the minifigs particularly the oven itself.    The second floor has 1 functional room. The other one is not since the Brick LIGHT is placed there so that when you press on the button it will light up the 1st floor with the different pastries.    d. The Horse Carriage: Very nice since it has an animal included, Horse with functional and swinging sides and back of the carriage so you can pose it as if you are placing the pine trees.    e. Other items I feel are included that make this a must have. Pine trees 4 pcs, the horse, shoe skates and a camera and apple for the little boys, also the different kinds of bread included, plus an axe, shovel, hoe and horse whip. I almost forgot an Owl figure for the flag pole.    3. Sturdiness: The main bakery shop is quite sturdy except for the lamp post that get easily removed if you handle it as well as the brick light placed hanging on the second floor and the roof on top of it. It Easily falls off if you handle it hard. The Pine tree stall has a small base which I just wished it was wider or larger to make it more stable.    4. Some minor gripes:  I have noted that my set has gray single studs instead of black for the lamp post, but looking at it now, it gave some contrast appearance instead of a dull black lamp post. Not sure if LEGO changed it without changing the instructions but I guess this made it unique for this model I got.    5. Modifiable: Well my daughter modified the hair, bodies of the minifigs. As in switching between the minifigs, I let her play with her imagination. :)  Since I bought a Santa Claue with Reindeer last Christmas (# 40010) I can place the whole piece on the top of the Bakery Roof as if Santa is either landing or flying away near the chimney. :) That is way cool for me. :)    So overall, I would say 5 stars for me since I plan to collect this Winter series every year to add to the growing Christmas decors for our family. However, If you dont like the seasonality of this series, then get other models
B000W7JWUA|5.0|When you first open Catan, you may be a little underwhelmed by the prevalence of cardboard pieces (I wish there was a more durable wood version of the board tiles) and the seemingly complicated rule book.  I admit, there were a few minor questions it didn't answer that I had to go to the website to figure out from the Q&A section.    With that being said: Never fear!  The positives far outweigh those criticisms.    The rule book covers all of the basics you'll need to know to start playing, and, after giving it a good read through, you should be ready to play, even if only one person has the time to read it.  Everyone I've played with learns quickly from my basic description of the rules and picks up the rest naturally and intuitively throughout the game.  For some reason, the new person to play the game always seems to win in the games I play.  Perhaps that speaks poorly of my Catan skills, but, on a positive note, it has contributed greatly to the game's popularity with my friends.  You can use a suggested set-up for new players and then after a game or two you can try more advanced set ups... that is a random set up of the board.  The coolest thing about Catan is simply that unlike Monopoly the board changes every time you play if you set up the tiles randomly (see the above illustration provided by Amazon).  It makes each game challenging and unique and fun to play.    Warning, the game can be a little cutthroat as you vie with other players to occupy the best areas of the board and as you use the \\"robber\\" piece to steal cards from other players.  Still, everyone's had fun with it and there are ways to adjust the game to make it suitable for kids to play too without hurt feelings.    This is the first \\"Euro\\" style strategy game I have ever played and I already think it is much better than Risk, though I'd still give \\"Diplomacy\\" the edge in terms of my favorite strategy board game.  This game is hands down better than your typical American game, from Monopoly toLife, and a nice change of pace from the games that seem to be most popular with the 20s crowd these days: Cranium, Scene-It, and Banagrams.    Also, you can play this game with two players as there is an official variant designed by Klaus Teber himself available online with some searching.  Still, I'd recommend playing with 3-4 if at all possible because the two player version is not as interactive in that the voluntary trading phase of each player's turn doesn't exist and is replaced by a forced trading mechanism using tokens.

6304698623|5.0|This adaptation of A Little Princess is refreshing and beautifully-filmed. Based upon the beloved children's classic, this adaptation begins with Sara Crewe (Liesel Matthews) regaling her Indian friend and Indian nanny with a mythological tale in Simla, India in 1914. Sara's father decides to send her to New York to study at the same boarding school attended by Sara's late mother. Given Sara's wealth, she is given a warm welcome by the haughty and greedy headmistress (Eleanor Bron) whilst Sara's father goes off to fight in the first world war.<br /><br />Sara's free-spiritedness is stifled by the domineering headmistress, and when tragedy strikes, Sara finds herself being kept on at the school in the capacity of a housemaid where she is treated abominably. Her only happiness comes from her flights of imagination, until Sara is finally able to find true happiness.<br /><br />The ending diverges from the book, but I felt this was ok given that the audience for such movies are usually young children. My kindergartner was satisfied with the happy ending, though we also know how the book ends (we read it prior to viewing the movie). The lead actress who plays Sara Crewe, Liesel Matthews credibly captures the strong will and determination of the spunky heroine. This is a family-friendly movie which will appeal mostly to young children.
B003XQG0JI|5.0|Sharon Corr's first solo album, \\"Dream of You\\" is probably as close as you can get to a brand new Corrs album.  Sharon provides much of the writing as well as lead vocal and violin.  Musicians who appear on most of the tracks include Keith Duffy (bass) and Anthony Drennen (guitars) who have played extensively for the Corrs as well as Jason Duffy (drums) who was brought in to play with the Corrs during the Borrowed Heaven tour when Caroline Corr had her baby.  There are also a number of guest artists who appear and offer a variety of influences.  All of this combines into an album with a familiar Corrs feel, one of the best mixtures of Celtic and rock/pop music.      The selection of music is mostly ballad oriented with a few traditional Celtic and up tempo pieces.  The album opens with a traditional Celtic instrumental \\"Our Wedding Day\\" setting the mood.  \\"Everybody's Got to Learn Sometime\\", written by James Warren, is a solid pop ballad track,  It is followed by \\"It's Not a Dream\\" which is written by Sharon and is one of the best tracks as well as Sharon's debut single release.    \\"Mná Na hÉirfeann\\" is a Celtic instrumental composed by Sean O'Rlada and features Jeff Beck on guitar with Sharon as lead on violin.  Jeff Beck's guitar solo is very effective in this Celtic context.  The following track, \\"Buenos Aires\\" also has a guest artist, the Spanish singer-songwriter Alex Ubago, performing a vocal duet with Sharon.    \\"So Long Ago\\", written by Sharon, has more of a power-ballad feel to it and is one of the stronger tracks - much like a typical Corrs song.    \\"Smalltown Boy\\", written by Steven Bronski, Larence Cole & James Somerville, offers Sharon a chance to flex her vocal talents.     \\"Cooley's Reel\\", an up tempo traditional Celtic instrumental, features Sharon on violin and Celtic virtuoso Davy Spillane (of Riverdance fame) on low whistle.  Gerry O'Connor provides an interesting use of banjo on a Celtic reel.    The last four tracks are all written by Sharon.\\"Butterflies\\" is a ballad sung by Sharon with a simple piano background and is very nice.  The title track, \\"Dream of You\\", has a definite Corrs flavor.  \\"Real World\\" is backed by the Irish Film Orchestra and Sharon provides a fine vocal performance along with her usual violin interludes.    The album concludes with the most unique cut, \\"Love Me Better\\" which has a more up tempo, funky feel to it - like something by Bonnie Raitt or Jewel.    If you are a fan of the Corrs (and if you are reading this, you probably are), Sharon's first solo effort is well worth your attention.  You get an album of music featuring not only Sharon Corr, but many of the musical elements that have made the Corrs a fan favorite for many years.  Add it to your collection and give it a listen or three.

0385341679|2.0|This is my first review that I have ever written, and that is because I am so epically disappointed in this book, that I had to review about it. I've read many books that I ended up hating, but this one just irks me on a level I can't explain.<br /><br />*SPOILERS ALERT*<br />First off, I love to read, but I am not a fan of romance novels. I tend to stay away from them because they seemed clich&eacute;d, over used, and un-original. The last series I read that I actually semi-liked was by Laurell K. Hamilton, but as everyone knows, her series turned into porn after the 5th book. When a friend told me about the Fae Fever series, I refused to read them because the story just sounded *so* unoriginal. She asked me to give them a chance, and I was so glad I did.<br /><br /> The author has a fantastic writing style, the characters seemed so real, she had a funny sense of humor, and she did a great job pacing the story. The story sucked me right in from the beginning and I couldn't wait to read more, more, and more. I loved how the author made something so original, so fresh, and so addicting to read. The best thing that I liked was that even though there was romance and sexual tension, she never turned her story into hard core porn, as most romance novels tend to do. And, when Mac finally did have sex, it was with *ONE* person instead of everyone.<br /><br />When this book came out, I was so excited. I ignored my school work and forced myself to read this book in about 5 hours. When I finished this book, I felt cheated. I couldn't believe that the author of this book had done what I thought she would never do; she rushed to finish the series without properly ending it, leaving questions unanswered, making characters totally change and act like they never would, it became cliched and there was so much sex in this book.<br /><br />There is hardly any action in this book. It's mostly Mac talking to herself, being depressed, being confused, and being lied to at every turn. She's constantly thinking about sex, almost every situation she's in, she finds some way to think about sex or make it sexual. She becomes so stupid in this book, too. Strong willed, witty and funny Mac is replaced by Mary Sue. She went from being a not-ugly but not-drop-dead-gorgeous-either, to OMG-everyone-wants-me. She went from having morals, to hardly having any. She has only known Jericho for 4 months and yet is willing to do everything for him. Why? Well, who knows, she seems to only love him for the sex, and that's all they have in common. There is literally NOTHING else that they have in common. Their relationship seems so forced and so wrong.<br /><br />The constant twists and turns was simply too much. Whenever one problem was solved, the author invented new ones and it just got annoying after a while. The ending was so terrible. We have so many unanswered questions; what is Jericho? What happened to Christian and how/if are the going to fix him? What the hell happened to Dani?<br /><br />The saddest thing of all is what happened to Vlane. Now, I'm not saying he couldn't have been the bad guy. But to make him be so bad and basically say \\"Yeah I raped you Mac, who gives a s***?\\" after we've spent 4 books (and most of this one) being so kind to her, doing anything for her, and even starting to have human emotions, is so insulting. I could see him becoming King and trying to get Mac to join him, but to say he was tricking her all along and raping her after all the character development feels like we've been cheated.<br /><br />Last, this was SUPPOSED to be the last book in the series. Why tell your readers it will be the last when it really isn't? \\"The end... or is it?\\" is so unfair when we've been hearing how this was supposed to be the book that gave us closure and answered all our questions. It feels like the author did like Laurell K. Hamilton; her series got popular quickly, she wanted to end it and instead of doing the right thing and take her time, she rushed it and ruined what could have been a great series. The only reason I'm giving this two stars is because she's a great writer and the first 4 books were truly amazing. I had never raved about book so much before this series; I just wish the ending had been everything I hoped for.y reason I'm giving this two stars is because she's a great writer and the first 4 books were truly amazing.

B0000CFW87|4.0|I love this CD!  Of all of Josh Groban's CDs, this one's my favorite.  His voice is amazing, but the accompaniment is lame.  I ignore it, but I think those that don't like Josh Groban would like him more if the accompaniment was better.
0545265355|5.0|Okay just for starters. I finished the Hunger Games in about 1 day. I only purchased the novels because I was hearing Fantastic things about it. Comparing it to one of my Favorite books of all time \\"The Long Walk.\\" I'm am a huge fan of Dystopian future books and the odd and different approches some books take. The Hunger Games, thought I have only finished book one and I am quickly skipping to Catching fire has me just wanting to read more and more, I'm even neglecting my Playstation for this series! Slightly odd being a 20 year old male and slightly enjoying romantic subplots it wasn't incredibly heavy or forced like some books that I have previously read. If you're looking for knock down drag out fights I'm sorry to disappoint, but there are very few. But just enough to wet your tongue as you wait for the intense moments to begin. That aside I particularly enjoyed the different female protagonist approach with Katniss. Her views and her decisions are much more likable than the Bella female archtype that seems to be some common in books these days, wandering around and hoping to understand the male species. If you are in for a very very addicting and Fantastic series to start. Defiantely start here.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|Look, do you what to hear authentic blues sung by one of the co-founding brothers of one of the greatest blues rock bands ever, the Allman Brothers Band, than buy this CD. This is Gregg Allman in exceptional form as a solo artist doing what he knows best - singing the blues. I'm not going to critique it because that's an exercise in futility and pointless. Gregg is the real deal, unlike the current barrel of American Idol \\"spooge monkeys\\" polluting the airwaves. T-Bone Burnett lends his \\"roots based\\" patina to the project and it blends perfectly with Gregg's style creating a real Delta Blues feeling without sounding over processed or pretentious. I recommend \\"Low Country Blues\\" very highly. If you don't enjoy it you shouldn't be listening to the blues.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This film is engrossing, funny, beautifully acted, and very moving, whether autism touches your life or not. Temple Grandin is one of my heroes; she has helped so many by being our tour guide into the autistic mind.  She also single-handedly revolutionized how livestock are treated in this country.  Her innovations in handling livestock more humanely are tremendous.  This film does an excellent job of fitting a lot of information in, while holding your interest.  The cast is excellent.  Make time for this one, you won't regret it.
1580176941|5.0|I am a cook, with a culinary degree and I am not a fan of baking. I am a horrible decorator. I can usually make things taste good, but not look good. With this book my first attempt came out pretty good, and I criticize myself harshly. It might seem like a lot of details and steps (it is), but if you read everything and follow every step it will come out really really good. Cookie slats, squeeze bottles, parchment paper, written out game plan,and doodling ideas, all worth having/doing. I made soccer balls, and that is not even in the book! Once I started to try and look at things like they do I realized \\"I have the power, I can make the rules\\". I made soccer balls with black sanding sugar. Even with all the work, it was fun, seriously. Awesome!
B00493AD74|1.0|In short pass. I watched this drivel with my mother over the holidays thinking it would be a wonderful chic flick with beautiful travel cinematography. It was terribly boring, no great travel shots and a waste of our time. Neither my mother nor myself are fans of Julia Roberts but thought perhaps this movie might be fine because of the travel. I only paid $1 from the kiosk rental but still not worth it. Save your money and time - even if on sale. I agree with another reviewer the companions in Italy were the most interesting part of the movie but never really developed the characters. The reason for the main character's up and leaving husband - the hopping in/out of bed from husband to flaky actor to sensual Javier Bardem. I could not emphathize with the character. Too self absorbed and she brought the unhappiness upon herself. For a similar chic flick I'd rather watch Under the Tuscan Sun which had a nice ensemble of characters that were allowed to develop; not Eat Pray Love.
B003L20ICE|5.0|I was in shock when I saw this film.  It was indeed one of the best films I have seen in years.  The acting, the script--everything was near perfection.  It is seldom that one sees a cast that is so cohesive.  I cannot recommend this film highly enough.  Annette Benning (great actress that she is) outdoes herself in what I consider perhaps the greatest role of her carreer.  Highly recommended.

Good game, everyone should get one.
B003Q6D282|4.0|I have had a checkered opinion on this series for awhile.  When I first viewed SAW back in '05, I was thrilled and decided it was my favorite original horror film of the decade... at least for a little while.  When SAW II and III came along, the vision was destroyed for me, and I sort of resented the series as nothing more than a tacky money maker milking the first movie for everything it was worth.  And then something happened.  The series kept going, and people kept going to see it.  As more and more of Jigsaw's history was unearthed, I found the series to be getting cheesier and cheesier, but also more interesting.    Let's get one thing straight, SAW 3D (or SAW: THE FINAL CHAPTER, as they are lamely yet necessarily calling it for home video purposes) is a tried and true popcorn movie; nothing more, nothing less.  While I can't say that I've made it to the movie theater for every one of these movies, I can comfortably say that they're much more enjoyable in a theater environment, whether it be an actual cinema or around the TV with a bunch of friends.  For me, there's little satisfaction to be had sitting in a room cringing, gagging and laughing all by myself, but it's a lot of fun with another person present.  At first I was resenting sequels to the first SAW because I felt that they lowered it from it's pedestal into the pit of B-movies, but I have to give the series credit for going as far as it did.  How many film franchises can boast hitting their first seven entries in their first seven years?  Not even Godzilla or James Bond can say that much, as many of their movies were given a few years to breathe in between productions.    Getting back to SAW 3D specifically, this is not a scary movie.  Don't expect much as far as plot or haunting ideas that stay with you for days like some films are capable of producing.  What you CAN expect is some haunting VISUALS that might stay with you for days, and some serious creativity in that department.  With the absence ofJigsaw himself as a major character, we're left with nothing but cardboard cutouts who we actually want to see die, and we are given just that; in that sense, the movie is a terrific success.  There's no sense in delving into plothole peeves; they're there, but that's not why we're watching this movie.  SAW 3D, and the SAW series as a whole (with the exception of maybe the first one) is not where we turn for extensive plot and character development, it is where we turn to see the work of some really talented special effects artists giving it all they've got, and I have to applaud the effort.    (... And I can't help but once again comment on the title change.  I don't really see any harm in calling the movie 'SAW 3D' for home video market, since that is the actual title card that appears in the film, which I'm glad they didn't change.  But if they HAD to change the name for perfectly logical reasons, I think 'SAW VII' would have done much better than the dreadfully overused 'The Final Chapter'.  Just a minor thought.)

0451228731|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and found it a fascinating read. There are plenty of other reviews providing a synopsis of the story so I won't bore you with another but I will say that, while the story in and of itself was entertaining, the real secret of the book are the concepts embedded within the story.  I found the idea of organizing society and its system of rewards along the lines of a computer video game fascinating and worth exploring further.<br /><br />I have never been a fan of fantasy and magic so at times I found the omnipresence of the Daemon bordering too much on the magical but what the heck, maybe our systems are compromised to that extent.  This concept by the way, and the idea of just how interconnected the world is today was a point that the book drove home for me.  I am by no means an expert on the subject but the book did make me aware of just how exposed our personal lives are to others through the Internet and other electronic networks.<br /><br />I did take the precaution of checking the security patches and protocols on my computer networks and computers as a result of reading this.  Yes, it had that effect.<br /><br />If your looking for a book that involves a good amount of intrigue while at the same time making you wonder who's watching whenever you turn on your computer this is the book for you.  From a technology standpoint, a possible future what-if standpoint and thriller standpoint this book is worth reading.  What a wonderful first novel for Daniel Suarez.  I'm looking forward to reading [[ASIN:B003MAJNUS Freedom (TM)]], the sequel.  Well worth a read.
B000A2UBN4|1.0|I know I am in the minority but mother of god this was bad.  The acting is hammy and the music is so over the top it feels like mystery cinema.  Honestly, I use this film as the benchmark for all films that are bad.    Sorry!
B0041KKYEW|2.0|Let's be clear.  BLACK SWAN is not a movie about dance or about romance. To say the least, BLACK SWAN is creepy, disturbing, and very strange.  It tries to be a horror flick on one level, and a psychological thriller on another.  Unfortunately, it fails miserably on both.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, BLACK SWAN is horrific, and, yes, I do understand what the director was trying to do. In many ways, it reminded me of the 1979 film \\"All That Jazz,\\" a bizarre and intimate look at choreographer Bob Fosse's life and his descent into drugs, sexual escapades, and near death experiences.  As with \\"All That Jazz,\\" BLACK SWAN plays like an acid trip gone bad...very, very bad.  You are never quite sure what is real, what is hallucination, or what is really going on.<br /><br />BLACK SWAN takes us back stage during a new, re-envisioned production of Swan Lake.  Ballerina Nina (Natalie Portman) has snagged the leading role of the White Swan, which is perfect for her delicate and shy personality.  At the same time, she must also play the Black Swan and bring a sexier, wilder personality to life.  The stress of it all is too much for Nina, and she slowly begins to spiral into madness.  By the end she no longer has any idea as to what is real and what is not.<br /><br />The problem is, neither do we.  For the most part, the characterizations are flat and clich&eacute;d.  Natalie Portman whispers throughout the film and is very difficult to understand.  Barbara Hershey is empty and cardboard as her mother trying to live vicariously through her daughter.  The director/choreographer, played by Vincent Cassel, is a stereotypical jerk who will do anything to get the performance he wants.  The shining exception in BLACK SWAN is Mila Kunis as a newcomer to the company who is selected to be Nina's understudy.  She does more acting, and quite good at that, than the rest of the cast combined, including Winona Ryder as the wacked out, aging prima ballerina.<br /><br />Other bright spots in BLACK SWAN include Tchaikovsky's brilliant Swan Lake score, which plays in gorgeous counterpoint to the action on screen, the exquisite dance sequences, and some very impressive and unexpected CGI.  However, these highlights are not enough for me to recommend BLACK SWAN.  And while the ending does leave you gasping, it is not in a good way.  I guess I don't want to be shaking my head at the end of a film.<br /><br />As a side note:  I really don't every need to see an actor or actress pleasuring themselves on screen.  Especially not multiple times.  And especially not Natalie Portman.

B001MEJY8W|3.0|This movie was wonderfully acted and directed. But, this isn't some more for the average Horror Film Genre. This movie is really brutal and not for the faint of heart. I give this movie 3 stars as it truly stayed on topic, but, the English Subtitles weren't in synch with the English translation and the subtitles weren't fully on par as well. But, thank goodness for the option of not reading the Subtitles. The sound and picture quality were great. If you are thinking of purchasing this movie, I recommend it simply because it's not your typical horror flick and is really dark and brutal. This movie delves into a world of true brutality, though I don't condone violence against women.
B000002MFE|5.0|The earliest recordings of Eric Clapton that I have heard date back to 1963 with The Yardbirds.  Nearly 30 years after with the release of \\"Unplugged\\", he is as good as ever.  Clapton's music is always very identifiable, whether electric or acoustic, and he is clearly one of the best blues guitarists of all time.  \\"Unplugged\\" was recorded on January 16th of 1992, and released on August 25th of the same year.  The album went on to win six Grammy Awards, and reached number one on the charts in the U.S.  The album includes some new pieces, as well as some old classics.    \\"Signe\\" is the only instrumental on the album, and is a new piece which Clapton wrote while on holiday and is named for the boat he was on when he wrote it.  \\"Before You Accuse Me\\" is a song which Eric Clapton has recorded before, an electric version for his \\"Journeyman\\" album, but the song is originally by Ellas McDaniel (a.k.a. Bo Diddley).  It is interesting hearing this in acoustic form, but I prefer the electric version.  \\"Hey Hey\\" is a song written by Big Bill Broonzy which Eric once said was probably the first blues song he had ever heard.  The fourth track is \\"Tears in Heaven\\", a live version of a song which was released on the \\"Rush\\" soundtrack in January of 1992.  The song, as probably everyone knows now, is about the loss of Eric's four-year-old son Conor in March of 1991.      \\"Lonely Stranger\\" is another of Clapton's songs, written around the same time, but it is a bit more general being about loneliness.  \\"Nobody Knows You When You're Down & Out\\" is a song by Jimmie Cox, but Clapton picked it up from Bessie Smith and recorded it for \\"Layla\\" and once again it appears here.  The album continues with the title track from \\"Layla\\", completely reworked as an acoustic version, and an amazingly new rendition equally as good as the original.  \\"Running on Faith\\" is another piece which Clapton recorded on his \\"Journeyman\\" album, it is a piece by Jerry Lynn Williams, one of many which he wrote for Clapton.      With \\"Walkin' Blues\\", Clapton returns to early blues as this is one of two pieces on the album which was originally done by Robert Johnson, but in this case Clapton creates a hybrid between Johnson's \\"Walkin' Blues\\" and Muddy Waters \\"Feel Like Going Home\\".  \\"Alberta\\" is another classic song which Clapton credits to Snooks Eaglin.  \\"San Francisco Bay Blues\\" is a folk song which is usually associated with Jesse Fuller.  \\"Malted Milk\\" is the second Robert Johnson piece on the album.  \\"Old Love\\" is a return to his newer works, and yet another piece from the \\"Journeyman\\" album.  The album then closes with a version of Muddy Waters' \\"Rollin' and Tumblin'\\".      \\"Unplugged\\" is a tremendous album, which allows users to once again hear just how well Eric Clapton can play the guitar.  All the musicians on this album do a wonderful job and deserve credit for the result as well.  These include: Ray Cooper (percussion), Nathan East (bass guitar, backing vocals), Steve Ferrone (drums), Chuck Leavell (keyboards), Andy Fairweather Low (guitar), Katie Kissoon (backing vocals), and Tessa Niles (backing vocals).  There is no doubt about it for me, this is a five-star album.

B0041KKYCY|5.0|I'm a fan of exploitation films and B Movies in general this is without a doubt one of the best remakes on an exploitation film I've ever seen.  People need to get over the fact that it is a remake if that is the only reason they would write a bad review on this movie.    As far as people just not having the stomach for a movie like this...well as one of the previous reviews said just move on.  Those people should have probably have never watched this movie to begin with.  If you want an up to date spin on a classic exploitation film and if you can check your morals at the door this movie is OUTSTANDING.      Oh yeah and Sarah Butler is so HOT it isn't funny.

0240810961|5.0|I actually found this book from a comment that veteran comic artist J.Scott Campbell had written on his facebook wall. He praised this book and gave it really high marks. \\"If one of the best comic artists in the field is impressed with a book then I ought to give it a look myself\\" I thought.  Truth be told, he was right.  Drawn to Life covers many areas  that I wished I had learned back when I was in college. Nowhere have I ever seen such a book so focused on creating stories in your art then in this book. I've been drawing for years, but after reading this book, I've seen a new life taken root in my characters and designs.   If you're having trouble with stiff characters, boring compositions, and a lack of general personality in your work. I would highly recommend this book for you.
0060936223|5.0|Someone who grows up as an English Major in Northern Wisconsin exists in the company of trees and cows and just sneaks off to see Broadway shows every once in a while.  Patti Smith's world is totally different from around here.  But while I read this I felt right at home in dingy tenaments and dark bars where no one was singing country western music.  I felt as though I had traded in my Talbots' suits and silk shirts for whatever I could find at Good Will and belonged right there with Patti and her incredible, ground-breaking friends.  The book is sheer poetry and living history of her generation.  I felt right at home with those people who weren't famous then but came to life in their music and photography.  The writing is breath-takingly beautiful even in the ugly reality of poverty and AIDS.  Just Kids deserved that National Book Award.  It's one to read over and live with.
B0015DROBO|2.0|I was not impressed. Had heard great things about the book, but, alas, I did not find them true. It was hard to follow and the ending was too abrupt. I would not recommend this book.
B002ZG980U|5.0|This movie had gotten a lot of buzz right out of the gate. With the actors involved, you knew it had to be good.     I finally got to watch this and couldn't take my eyes off the screen. The imagery was absolutely amazing as well as the storyline.     Leo DiCaprio has definitely taken his game up a notch the last few films he's done and I'm glad to see that he's evolving into different roles beyond Titanic.     The storyline can't really be explained without giving too much away. I prefer to not get into it as I hate having surprise stories or endings ruined for me.    It is definitely one that gets you thinking (a la The Matrix) and you need to keep your eyes and ears open to follow the story. Otherwise, you will just be confused.
6305907145|2.0|I'm a huge fan of Jane Austen and I've seen most of the adaptations of her books that have been made into films.  This one is by far the least faithful to the novel.  In the movie, Fanny Price is a combination of the book character and Jane Austen herself.  Fanny is always writing and the writing is quoted from Jane Austen's Juvenalia.  If that weren't bad enough, Edmund is portrayed as weak-willed, Lady Betram is addicted to laudanum, and Sir Thomas Betram is a cruel slave owner.  Things only subtly hinted at in the orginal novel are exaggerated into graphic detail in the movie.  I can tolerate a few liberties with the original book but this is nowhere near it.  My husband who hasn't read the book says it's an OK period piece.  I can't stand it because although the plot is similar to the book, the characters bear almost no resemblence to their literal counterparts.  The actress playing Fanny is pretty but she's far too old to play a 17 or 18 year old girl.  Jonny Lee Miller, who makes a good Mr. Knightly in the latest version of Emma, is simply OK as Edmund in this.  If you want a decent version of Mansfield Park, I recommend the old BBC version with Sylvestra LaTouzel (hopefully spelling that right) as Fanny Price.  There is a newer version which is better than this but stars Billie Piper who is badly miscast as Fanny.

No doubt the book itself developed in tandem with Patrick Benson's illustrations. I wanted to get the paperback without the DVD but I could not find it on Amazon. Amazon could have done a much better job of describing what 'Candlewick Storybook Animations\\" meant at the title portion of the book's web-page. Anyone who is looking for more picture books for children should explore Martin Waddell's wonderful collaborations with many artists.

B004MDZWOU|5.0|Had to download this on Demand due to a DVR glitch. Think CW kinda dropped the ball on the programming as it pushed back the original 'air' date.     After much delay; I finally got to watch the 'winter' hiatus return episode. And it was all that I had hoped for.     I have been a fan since Episode 1 and the flow of this episode and backdrop is exactly what I remembered. From character interaction to the feeling that it's all about the 'brother's.     Setup a great intro to the 'big bad' of the season.
B0032UYFA6|2.0|I loved seasons 1 and 2.  Engrossing, gripping plot, superb acting, lots of surprises.  As in all great tv, the story line was extremely unconventional but despite its craziness it had deep plausibility, once you accepted its basic premise.    Season 3 was for me a huge disappointment. First, the soap opera aspects became bigger and bigger -- marriage, infidelity, long scenes in Walt's home, etc.  When these were complementing a fast-moving plot with lots of interesting action, fine.  But as the main content of the show?  Boring, boring, boring.  Second, the actions of the characters have become increasingly implausible, and that's a serious problem.  Jesse, most of all.  Hank.  Skyler.  Walt least of all, which is good -- his evolution holds it together, and makes emotional sense.  But the plot of the show became driven more and more by contrived and implausible actions by everybody.  I am not spelling them out here to avoid spoilers, but Jesse's schemes are way too stupid and senseless even for him, Skyler's actions v-a-v Walt and his business keep coming from out of the blue and don't fit with her carefully developed character at all, and the behavior of Hank, a veteran agent, who suddenly starts acting like a psycho bad lieutenant type of cop, also feels like a bad writer's desperate attempts to keep things moving.    Lastly, the basic plot line itself has become too far-fetched.  Gus' machinations with regard to the cartel, for example.  Scene after scene of Walt and Jesse acting like maniacs in their lab, as though no one can see or here them.  Even -- and this is a spoiler, so don't read if you've not yet watched and are planning to -- the attack on Hank by the two Mexican hitmen.  They've been built up for the whole season as these incredibly ruthless, scary, unstoppable killers, and somehow they blow a simple hit so badly that Hank, without his gun, is able to kill one and nearly kill the other, and survive.  That was a hugely unbelievable anticlimax -- badtv at its worst.   I am not particularly looking forward to season 4, although I would be delighted if the show can recapture its lost intensity and spark.
030745455X|5.0|The Girl who Played with Fire is so gripping that it stayed with me until I'd read all three books in The Millennium Trilogy by Stieg Larsson.  Please read them in order 1) The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo; 2) The Girl Who Played with Fire; 3) The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest. I don't usually take the time to review books because being a prolific reader there would be too many but this series deserves it.  I found myself really feeling sad the the author, Stieg Larsson, died soon after the last book was completed.  The characters are so complelling that I was left wanting to be taken on another journey with the unlikely misfit hero Lisbeth Salander. She rocks!
B004EQAVHI|2.0|Performances great, directing great, cinematography great, but the subject matter? This is the most depressing movie in the history of movies. The studio tried to market it as a \\"haunting\\" movie about eternal love. And then they wondered why it didn't make any money. What did not make any sense to me was how these people just accepted their fate without almost a hint of a fight. I'm thankful we don't live in the dystopic (yes, I looked it up) society in which supposedly this story takes place, brrrr.
B004856SQ8|5.0|Simply put, in a year that had a few \\"team\\" movies, I refer to The Losers, The A-Team & The Expendables, this goes down as a just fun, don't take it serious for awhile diversion!<br />I had my reservations originally when I heard the first set of news that there was going to be an A-team full length feature film. I mean, I grew up with the series, had over the years bought all the boxsets, screamed & yelled to high heaven when that complete boxset was announced & released! Such is life! Anyway, with one of the original cast members not with us anymore, one only wondered if any of the surviving members would make some sort of contribution, albeit cameo roles!<br />This film does not fail to entertain & given the benefit of two versions of the movie, what more can anyone ask for! There was the right amounts of action, thrills, comedy & yes, an appearance by the director also!<br />To summarise the plot, though there is very little more I can say, the members come together in Mexico & become a well-tuned team, serve together for eight years & were about to leave Iran at the end of their tour of duty. Sounds simple enough, but, with the possiblity of \\"sticking it\\" to Saddam, they accept one last mission to get the money that he printed, the plates used & return them to the U.S.<br />But nothing that simple ever goes right, their commanding officer is apparently killed, the A-Team is wrongfully accused, tried & convicted for the crime. Six months elapse & the C.I.A. agent instrumental in the fiasco prior to their incarceration, makes an offer to \\"spring\\" them & right the wrongs against them. That's when the mayhem insues!<br />This movie was quite memorable in many ways & more so, as this was the last that Stephen J. Cannell produced prior to his passing. From the making of featurette, it looked that he greatly approved all the goings on & looked particularly happy at the time.<br />Nonetheless, the series was great fun during which no one gets killed, though by the near end of the series, there were a few deaths & so does this movie.<br />Great fun to kill a couple of hours, get it!e were a few deaths & so does this movie.   Great fun to kill a couple of hours, get it!
B003L20ICE|5.0|I just finished watching this film and had to come write a review.     It's been getting a lot of 'Oscar buzz' and I had originally had interest in it when it first came to theaters.     The cast was well-acted; even down to the teenage kids.     I don't want to give too much away but the concept of a 'unique family' vs. a traditional family concept. And the choices we all make which will ultimately - lead to paths in our lives.     Not really a 'family' movie but definitely had the recurring theme about 'family' throughout the flick.
B000003C5C|5.0|Death is the founding band of the genre, and Leprosy is one of their finest efforts. The musical composition is extremely tight, the vocals are powerful, and the lyrics are hard-hitting. Scream Bloody Gore was a good album, but Leprosy was a step higher up than anyone could have foreseen. This is a must-have for fans of Death, or metal in general.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I love it, but the controller isn't as sturdy as the X360, however it can send data faser resulting in faster sensory response. I played FIFA 11 on X360 and the controlls are slow, however it's extremely fast on PS3. So take good care of your PS3 controller. BUY IT!
B001TKKAJG|5.0|Can't seem to figure out why there are so many negative reviews of the sound quality of this Band masterpiece. For a piece of recording from 1968, this mastering job actually sounds terrific!  The SACD layer definitely sounds richer but even the CD layer is commendable and up to par with other excellent MOFI releases. Mobile Fidelity has done it again. I'm proud to have Music from Big Pink amongst my other MOFI discs.
0446195529|5.0|I have not been gripped by a single author for many years, since I read/ absorbed/ all of Taylor Caldwell's titles. Baldacci tells intelligent, very real page-turners that awaken many questions about what's happening in our government and world affairs. He researches deeply and authentically, and writes with complexity and integrity. Always a fascinating read. Have bought all his titles now, and trying to read in some sort of order. Love all the \\"Camel Club\\" related stories. Love them all!!!
B003Q6D27S|3.0|I had to watch this just to finish out the \\"Saw\\" movies. The last few have been a bit slow & predictable (so & so survives & keeps killing, etc).     So I wanted to see how the franchise finished out. There were some twists which I didn't see coming but also glad to see the ultimate twist in the end.     Glad the movies are finally over & now I can stop trying to test out my 'yuck' factor.
B002UQN0G8|4.0|Shared this book with a child who was struggling with reading comprehension. He loved it, and was at once interested and felt 'smarter' reading something he enjoyed.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|I was very pleased.  Especially with the first Alien DVD.  Perfect clarity.  The others were okay - taking in account the type of filming they used for the original movie.  Overall, very pleased.  Thank you!
B004CAWKXE|3.0|That pretty much says it all...if you loved MCR for their darker, deep, lyrics and sound...then youll be dissapointed. But its to be expected. Once youre not 23 any longer and married and rich, you just cant write good lyrics any more. There are no exceptions to this rule.
0399215921|1.0|I was disappointed when this book arrived and it was so small.  I did not see any indication that this was such a small book.   I bought it for a gift because I already own the board book version and love the story.
B004D9FH20|2.0|The description mentiones an audioplay performance, as well as a luxury oxford edition, neither of which are included here.<br /><br />While these stories are obviously deserved classics, this is just one of five short story collections and 4 novels published by Arthur Conan Doyle. Elsewhere on the Kindle store, for the same price you can get the entire collection, all 4 novels plus all 5 short story collections, under the name Sherlock Holmes Complete Collection.
B001OQCV2O|4.0|I saw this movie in the theaters and the bluray does not let me down. I have a large HDTV and I'm a fan of large on screen destruction. The sound and video quality are flawless. Some people don't like the side story but its hard to make a movie for people to follow that has no glue holding it together. Great buy.
B0021L8V0W|5.0|Great action, good plot line. Yes, some of the scenes are strictly over the top on reality, but if you like movies like Mission Impossible 1, 2 & 3 or True Lies or any spy action movie of that sort then you will love Salt. Good plot, has most people guessing till the end.
0385341679|5.0|I've been reading since the day I got the book Jan.20th. I've been too busy to finish in a couple of days and it was  hard to digest all the material. It was well worth it. All questions were answered and KM did a great job tying up loose ends. I've read all her books and she is the best. Thanks Karen. I recommend reading all Fever books before reading this however. Have fun reading!
B003NWS5AO|5.0|This latest from Robert Plant is a great next step in an always intriguing musical journey.  This album is so listenable, and the title is dead on: you hear and feel the joy in this band of musicians. Patti Griffin is an excellent vocal partner, and Buddy Miller has gathered up  amazing material for this album. Don't compare this to Led Zeppelin. That does a tremendous disservice to Robert Plant. Just give this one listen and you will be hooked, just like I was.
0142000655|5.0|I have no problem admitting that I picked this book up for the author. I have had great success with the other books Steinbeck has written and this one is a masterpiece as well. What I liked about this one, however, is all of the lessons and hidden meanings that go along with the novel and the different interpretations that each reader has.     It is important to remember that Steinbeck considers \\"East of Eden\\" his masterpiece. \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" had already become a classic in its own right but he was proud of this book in particular. Though I have to disagree to \\"East of Eden\\" being a better novel than \\"Grapes of Wrath\\", I can understand and respect all of the pride that is felt within the book.    Like his other books, \\"East of Eden\\" starts out very slow and very descriptive. Steinbeck takes us into the lives of two different families; the Trasks and the Hamiltons. The two families both have farms in Salinas Valley, but one family has wealth and the other does not. Just before I wanted to throw the book across the room from being fed up with imagery, Steinbeck once again grabbed my attention with the introduction of Cathy Ames.     By the time Cathy (Kate later in the novel) is introduced, the reader realizes that they are hooked to the novel. The reader has enough background on all the characters to feel like they are in the barn right next to the Hamiltons milking cows. This brings a tremendous amount of appreciation for each character.     Throughout the book a series of life changing events are constantly introduced to the reader and each scene is crucial to the novel. Each and every character is essential to the novel and by the end the reader can fully accept and appreciate each one. Some people will go into all the symbolism of this book with the story of Cain and Abel, or the obvious link to the garden of Eden and praise the book for how well the story adapted to the time period it was written. Though this was very apparent and is an excellent story analyze, I chose to focus on all the goodness found in the book.     Not to spoil the book, but many horribly sad and heart wrenching events take place. What I took away from the book was to look at the Hamiltons and the Trasks and see how different characters coped. It's truly amazing how good triumphed evil and really teaches a valid lesson of forgiveness. Martha Washington once said \\"I am still determined to be cheerful and happy, in whatever situation I may be; for I have also learned from experience that the greater part of our happiness or misery depends upon our disposions, and not upon our circumstances\\". The Hamiltons especially lived by this quote. It was really an eye opener and lovely book.     This book deserves to be a classic and John Steinbeck deserves to go down in history of one of the greatest authors of American Literature.
B003HC8ITI|5.0|I bought this as a lightning deal for $20 down from $120. The movies itself is a great movie and the quality it beautiful on my 65\\" tv. The kids and i love it. Ive used both the dvd and bluray but have not used the digital download and prolly never will. The picture frame is a lot nicer than i thought i would be. Very well made and looks great. I hope to get a movie room someday and will hang it up with other frames like it. If you can get it for lower than the msrp i say get it.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|This movie was obviously under-rated. I hadn't heard about this movie until it came to Dvd. Its over the top with action, great story line, very well acted and directed. Affleck is at his best. You may hear that some of the plot is familiar with other movies, believe me, the slight similarity's to any other movie is strongly over shadowed by the great acting, superb directing as well as the little twists that show up throughout the movie. This ones a keeper, don't pass it up.
0062064304|5.0|every book that comes out of weta workshop is always so well done, sometimes on big films some art books are good but could have been better. these books are never a let down, they never leave anything out, this book was amazing and there track record in the past on the art of lord of the rings books and king kong are examples of there effort in making the book to the best possible product to be enjoyed by all.
B002ZG99NG|5.0|Heard really good things about this movie and that usually means that I am being setup for disappointment but this movie really delivers.  I didn't really thing there was going to be a lot of action in this movie but I think its a really good mix of action along with some decent character development.  While not all of the character development is totally believable it definitely adds to and is critical to this movie.  I rented this originally from Red Box and it contained only the \\"theatrical\\" cut of this.  I am really looking forward to watching the additional half hour that the extended cut adds to this movie.
B00005JKJA|1.0|Yes, I get the film.  And I like convoluted movies.  However I have never seen such wooden acting.  Perhaps David Lynch intended that to seem dreamlike, however it doesn't convey \\"dream sequence\\" to me- it just reminds me of really bad D-- movies I have seen in the past - made on 3 digit budgets. Also, the slow disconnected performances and delayed responses are not really consistent with the theme - so as an artistic form it doesn't work.  If the main character were OD-ing on drugs maybe.<br /><br />There are many very cool movies where the viewer has to work to figure out what is real and what isn't.  To me this one seemed lame in the extreme.
B001E45XT4|5.0|I'm not a gamer but I like to talk. I wanted something that was comfortable, had a microphone, wasn't earbuds, not expensive, and sound isolating. I got all but the last with these. Don't expect them to dampen the sounds around you. My ear buds with the soft rubber do a much better job at that but I can't stand wearing them for more than an hour. What is great about these is the soft cushions around the ears and on top, the great sounding microphone (I use GMail chat and calls with Google Voice primarily), and the relatively good sound quality. I'm no audio fanatic but these sound good. Because they are bigger speakers than the tiny ear buds and because they are further from my ear I must turn up the volume more than my ear buds. Not an issue. I find it preferable because it means bass is stronger and hissing noises are quieter. The other downside, besides the lack of noise isolation, is the size. I look like I should be flying a helicopter with these on. Overall, I'd recommend them if you can stand the size.<br /><br />EDIT 12/12/12:<br />I've had these for almost two years now and use them every day. I've since obtained some JVC HANC250 noise cancelling headphones and, after using those for some time, I now know that the sound quality of the Plantronics isn't anything to write home about. They're fine but not great. The big thing I still like about them is being able to wear them all day comfortably. The retracting mic is nice, too.<br /><br />I predict I'll eventually stop using these headphones because of the inline volume dial. Don't use it if you can. I can tell it's starting to flake out. If I move it, the left and right speaker volumes can become unbalanced and I have to keep toying with it until it's right again. Annoying but not a big deal as long as I can fix it.
B002ZG980U|5.0|I loved this movie, after watching I couldn't figure out the 3 other people around me didn't like it, I finally figured it out. This movie a has at least 3 levels of premise. Not saying it complicated, its actually quite simple, but the movie carry's out as a dream within a dream within a dream. Although the movie plays deeper into these levels, they're  all connected. Imagine a house that has 3-4 basements, each one below the other. To get what you need you have to work your way through through a series of obstacles physically and mentally going down, and when you get there, getting back up to the main floor(reality/awake), will be twice as hard. Then you have to make sure your back into reality(awake) so your not stuck in a dream for eternity. Thats all I can say without giving away important story plots. So with that, if you like a good action movie with the obvious need to do some thinking to keep up, then you'll love this...if you don't like movies that you have to use your head, then this wont be for you.
B00004RF9B|5.0|What can you say about a classic that lives on? It continues to be relevant through the years. The special effects may be a tad dated but they fulfill the need and continue to hold their own. Fantastic movie that can still scare the pants off of you!   No movie review here, others have given wonderful reports.   Only pure adoration here!   Enjoy! }:o)
0740785508|5.0|Imaginative Realism explains techniques to help artists express their inner vision more realistically. This is a fantastic bag of tricks for anyone who has ever said, \\"Man I just wish I could get onto paper or canvas what I have in my head!\\"<br /><br />The photos and illustrations are ample and in good taste, they supplement the text but do not distract from it. The binding is quite sound for a paper back and the print and photo quality are quite good. Worth the price, though I will say as much use as this book has ALREADY received in my studio I will be hard-binding myself and would suggest the same to anyone else.<br /><br />Well folks James Gurney has given us this fantastic book to show us a myriad on methods. I am incredibly pleased with my purchase and without hesitation I can say if you are going to buy ONE art book this year...make it either this one or his other book Light and Color, also available on Amazon.
B0020TS5KQ|5.0|Loved the book. Loved the movie. Yes, they're different. Aren't they always?    I have purchased this movie at least 5 times and have watched it at least 20 times. I keep lending it and not getting it back. It's warm, sweet and spicy, just like a good cup of chocolate. The color palette is entrancing. The lighting is mesmerizing. The story is entertaining and the acting is subtle and seductive.     Now I've done it. I need to either go watch it again or find a good bite of chocolate. Maybe both.
0765326353|5.0|I'm not going to create a very long review. I was amazed at how engrossed I became in this book. The story line is epic. The structure of the story causes the anticipation to grow and grow. I was astonished that after 1001 pages, the story has just begun. I can't wait for book two to come out, but I guess I have no choice.
B003L20IFQ|2.0|In fact the ending actually ruined the whole movie, have no use for this movie now and dont plan on ever watching it again, it would simply be a waste of time. Listen, the plot is great, man stuck in a coffin with a cell phone and very little light & running out of time(air). All great stuff, Reynolds is fantastic and believable, when the ending comes up you could expect 3-4 different outcomes, except the one that they chose to end this movie. For me it made the whole movie a waste of time watching it.
0740797719|5.0|Somewhere between a realists reference bible and a magicians bag of tricks. A mix of theory, technique, common sense and science. Color and Light is broken down into chapters which can easily be skipped through at will. Each chapter has a header and a brief synopsis of the chapter. While there is no need to read this book from cover to cover you will most likely have a difficult time refraining from doing so. An extremely informative and yet entertaining read. Regardless of your skill, education (or lack thereof) there is truly something for every artist in this fine tome. I know it will be in my studio for years to come.    Illustrations and photos are plentiful, used only where necessary and not redundant. The image and print quality is also superb.    Mr.Gurney proves to be as skilled in writing and teaching as he is at his oil paintings and illustrations.     Also see his second book Imaginative Realism: How To Paint What Doesn't Exist. Don't let the cute green alien on the cover fool you, this is NOT just a book for fantasy and sci-fi artists. It is another fantastic bag of tricks from a modern master that will help you become less dependent on reality and more free to create from your inner vision.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Winning Combination - Best movies of the year meets one of the best Blu-ray discs out there. Excellent Audio and Video Quality.  I have watched it 3 times already and it only gets better every time. P.S Definitely a bass heavy sound track.
0143118420|4.0|Eat, Pray, Love is not the book you were expecting. I applaud the author for offering the world such a vivid account of her spiritual trek. That being said, how can one like her? How can one follow this woman's philosophy around the world and believe that she a genuine or sincere human being? Plain and simple: she is unlikeable. And this isn't just something that comes up out of the blue halfway through the book, this happens by page twenty. Saving grace: Gilbert is a fantastic writer and even though we may not like her, we still want to be voyeurs and travel this road with her. She's so good at what she does that we can't turn our heads. This is a very important book for young women and I think every parent should give their daughter a chance to read this. No, we don't want the youth of America becoming exactly like Gilbert; we want our youths to be themselves and learn about themselves and the world around them. Gilbert's world is a world that shuts down the philosophy that we should be doing something \\"right,\\" or what we're expected to do. Glbert does what is appropriate for her. She finds herself. Though we may not think her voyage inpsires people to make completely healthy decisions, it definitely inspires people to focus on themselves and improve their outlook on life. Is that such a bad thing? I think the problem with the reviews here is that far too many people took this book too seriously. At the end of the day, this is just an ambitious, over-marketed self-help book. If you expect more from it than that, then you've already gone too far and can't see the positive aspects of this work.
B0049GYXDG|5.0|I'm a bit of a Blu Ray classic Disney connoisseur.  I have Snow White, Fantasia, Sleeping Beauty, Pinocchio, Beauty and the Beast, etc. and every time the phenomenal restorations blow my mind.  My eyes are usually bugged out in amazement release after release. Thus, by now you'd think that my expectations would be well prepared for what I was about to see with Alice in Wonderland--but no, just seconds into this 60-year-old masterpiece I started to cry.  No, not a gushing pool-of-tears sort of crying, but a crying nonetheless.<br /><br />The 1080p transfer is Amazing.  It's better than Amazing--it's somewhere between Mesmerizing, Astonishing, Perfect, and Life-Changing.  I'm comparing it to the VHS copy I watched till it broke as a kid, as well as the more recent 2004 \\"Masterpiece Edition\\" DVD that I not-so-secretly watched a bazillion times as an adult.  I can't even begin to describe how beautiful the picture looks, but the reds are pure fire, the tea party is a kaleidoscope of every vibrant color you could dream of, the Rabbit's eyes are are a hypnotic magenta that I've never seen before because the standard definitions couldn't bold them enough.  The sound quality is rich and lively, it might as well have been recorded in the world's top recording studio yesterday.<br /><br />Overall, without question this is one of the most important Vault Disney titles to get.  Don't let your mind be rotted by Tim Burton's commercialist adaptation with dancing Depp when you can experience a masterpiece of visual art, music, and storytelling from Walt Disney himself.  Alice in Wonderland has always been one of my top five favorite Disney films.  It's the only adaptation, as far as I'm concerned, that correctly portrays the childish innocence from the Lewis Carroll books, along side the adult brilliance in the characters, \\"morals\\", and possibly herb-induced inspirations.  I haven't got around to watching the extras yet, but they really don't matter to me.  I got the most stunning Blu Ray transfer of one of my favorite movies for an affordable price.  I'm very satisfied. :)<br /><br />**PS: It includes a glorious trailer for the new Winnnie the Pooh movie.  It looks really good and breath-taking in HD!fer of one of my favorite movies for an affordable price.

0061703087|4.0|This was my first Michael Crichton book, and I'm about to buy another.  It held my attention throughout; in fact, I read the last two thirds of it in one sitting.      I'm only giving it four stars, though, because of one recurring flaw.  I'm a stickler for realistic dialog.  A commonly used phrase in English is \\"Oh yeah?\\", but in this book, all the characters say \\"Oh yes?\\" instead.  Who says \\"Oh yes?\\"?  No one I've ever known, that's for sure.  It's like some idiot editor decided to do a blanket search for the word \\"yeah\\" and replace it with \\"yes\\" in every instance.  Now that I think about it, I don't think the word \\"yeah\\" appeared anywhere in the book.  Very unrealistic, and very annoying.  I feel certain this was indeed an editorial blunder, because the rest of the dialog seemed fine to me.    Other than that one thing, it was a fun, enthralling read.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|So I bought one set awhile back and enjoyed them. Very Much. A couple of weeks later I decided to buy another pair for my other controller. I was sad to see that I got two different types of Dual Triggers. One is what you see pictured, the other is a different looking type trigger. I guess it does what it's suppose to do, but just makes me sad that there's two different version of it. As for how it works, it works great. Never had it clip off from the triggers unless I'm trying to get them off. But I can see why some people have problems with keeping it on.
B003062NG0|5.0|Unlike the commercially succesful, highly artistic bands of the past, Porcupine Tree keep getting better as they age. Just when it seems like they'll never top one album's brilliance they release another that does just that! I could make the usual comparisons to Pink Floyd, Yes, King Crimson, or even Led Zeppelin, but this band never gets stale. The Beatles are the only group I can think of that have stayed as fresh throughout their existance. The only difference, obviously, is the double edged sword of commercialism. It gave them more recognition, but they burned out from it. Porcupine Tree is both cursed and blessed by their lack of mainstream media hype. It may hurt their pocketbooks, but it helps their art. I doubt that they would be so dedicated if they had gotten to be overindulgent,spoiled party animals that many of their forebears had done in the heyday of Rok N' Roll. These guys keep driving the artistic side of Rock music. Rock music as a form of high art like the Jazz musicians of the earlier part of the twentieth century did for the folk arts of Dixieland and The Blues. I just wish Frank Zappa could hear them!

030726999X|2.0|Really, the final book of this trilogy did not have to be this long.  At the beginning of this book, the most interesting characters are either dead, on the run, lame, or incapacitated.  There's very little action, and the ultimate conspiracy that unfolds isn't much of a conspiracy at all (just a few rogue secret police agents with nothing to lose except their pride).  The arch-villain seems to be an emotionally disturbed psychologist (I know that's redundant phrasing) who gets his comeuppance in court.  This last novel introduces a swath of uninteresting, unimportant characters, and minor characters go on to do insignificant things.  The second book was really the lynch-pin of the trilogy, and in the final book readers can just flip through the pages.
B000JQU1VS|4.0|I reread the Adventures with my 15-year old son, his first time.  My middle-aged professor reaction to the book differed, of course, from my memories of teenage Holmes reading, but my son's response made me think the difference was stage-of-life rather than the material playing differently in 2011 than in the '70's, and I still enjoyed it.  At the same time, the construction of the Holmesian deductions now seems all too visible, the solutions frequently obvious, some of the situations absurd, and Holmes' detection, in some cases, quite limited.  Reading from this older perspective recast Holmes a bit towards the source of a genre, displaying critical elements in very basic way, and away from a sense of it being any sort of highlight.  Sort of like now listening to Rapper's Delight.
B0039208CG|2.0|You know you're in trouble when Alfred asks Batman: \\"Can I persuade you to take a sandwich with you, sir?\\" and Batman rasps: \\"I'll get drive-through.\\"  After the first two Batman films directed by Tim Burton, something was lost.  The first had Jack Nicholson and Jack Palance for the heavies and Michael Keaton and Kim Basinger weren't at all bad.  You really became involved with Nicholson's characterization of the Joker due undeniably to his great screen presence.  The second film, which many disliked for being dark and nihilistic was, I thought, quite funny thanks to Danny DeVito's great delivery.  As long as you don't take anything seriously in it, it's a pretty good picture.   The problem with \\"Batman Forever\\" is that it is forever over the top.  Too much color, too much noise, too much of Jim Carrey's teeth.  Carrey's character becomes tiring in the first ten minutes and Tommy Lee Jones' face makeup appears to made out of candy.  The character of Robin (Chris O'Donnell) is introduced who, after an heroic feat of saving a circus tent full of spectators, becomes bratty and brooding.  Alright, so he  lost his entire family in the circus scene -- he seems to be able to forget it quickly enough.  Val Kilmer, as Batman, keeps Robin from leaving by luring him into his mansion to show him his collection of motorcycles.  This and the repeated references to being \\"partners\\" make somewhat pointed implications.  One of Robin's lines later in the picture tries to get a laugh by making a reference to the old Batman television program: \\"Holy rusted metal, Batman!\\" But it falls flat as does most of the picture.  The plot of the thing is contrived beyond belief and one's curiosity for the outcome fades by half-time.  The city-scapes and buildings look more than ever like miniatures when seen in the unforgiving clarity of Blu-ray.  Missing also is Danny Elfman's superb scoring, which brought a great deal to the first two films.
B001UV4XFG|1.0|OK. I've had it. This is the 3rd movie. I've gone back and watched the first to see if there was a time when Bella's silent stare off into space, her angst, her willfulness to disregard ANYTHING that might help herself, had made the movie better and the movies succeed IN SPITE of her due to the team Edward vs. team Jacob rivalry. Could the script writers do ANYTHING to help her character lessen her stupidity on going off into the woods to ponder when that is the LAST place she should be going? Bella is the most stupid of female characters and its a travesty that this is what tweens and twentysomethings in the audiences are vying to become. If this is the state of relationships between males and females of this age bracket and its being played out as Bella lays on her bed with her hands splayed or always playing through her hair or having the attention span of a gnat with regards to everything else around her, its dysfunctional and these movies just encourage this. The Vampire council already wants her changed to vampire which she willingly wants to give herself up to and has been trying to get Edward to \\"change\\" her all along, but that's the whole point: she cannot see anything good in her life as it is, so she must become something ELSE, and she needs a man to help her become something BETTER.  Its this vacuum of nothingness inside of Bella that I've had enough of. She's empty and pathetic as a character and I hope that girls and young women out there see her as NOT something to strive to be.
030745455X|4.0|While this book does start slow, the pacing is tight and right halfway through, and it's an absorbing and entertaining read.<br /><br />While there are two protagonists -- a crusading journalist and a emotionally disturbed hacker -- it's really the hacker that commands our attention.  Her superpower is her ability to navigate the Internet, to hack and to take over computer hard drives, which nowadays is like entering someone's mind and fumbling around as though you were in his bedroom.  There's something disturbing and insidious about Lisbeth Salander (even her name itself is disturbing and insidious), but there's also something compelling and attractive about her as well.  She is in many ways the left-wing female answer to Jack Bauer, another paranoid, psychotic superhuman out to save the human race from itself.  And while not as fast-paced as \\"24,\\" this book nevertheless does have many Hollywood trademarks, most notably a suspenseful, twisting, expanding conspiracy plot-line.<br /><br />This book is a far more entertaining read than its prequel \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\\" and in my opinion the best book of the trilogy.

B001HN6940|4.0|When I first saw the 1951 animated version of  Disney's \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" I liked it immediately and it remained my favorite Disney animated feature ever since.  FIrst because of the funny and crazy design of the film and also because, as a radio listener,  I recognized most of the great voices used in the picture:  Ed Wynn, Jerry Colonna, Verna Felton, Sterling Holloway, et al.  When I heard that the Disney Co. had undertaken a remake of this story, I feared the worst: It would be modernized, it would lose  its charm and humor.  As is often the case, I was wrong:  The two versions are completely different in approach and both are most entertaining.           The new film is a masterpiece of production design and wonderful characterizations given by a fine British cast.  Even beyond this are the amazing visual effects that give the Blu-ray version a real advantage.  Nearly every scene involves complicated processing which is seamless and impossible to analyze on first viewing.  The additional features, which explain how some of this was accomplished, indicate what a grueling effort the making of this film must have been.      Mia Wasikowska is a lovely (older) Alice.  The Mad Hatter and the Red Queen are wonderfully played by Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter.   The voices used for various animated characters are superb choices:  Alan Rickman, Michael Sheen, Timothy Spall, Barbara Windsor, Michael Gough.  One remembers Michael Gough as an important player in the Alec Guinness comedy, \\"The Man in the White Suit,\\" made by Ealing Studios sixty years ago and Mr. Gough is still working, bless him.           Not to be repetitive, this film is one of the great examples of the advantages of Blu-ray.  Having both versions to compare, I was very impressed by the additional detail brought forward by Blu-ray and how much can be missed watching the standard DVD.  For example, at the very beginning of the opening title, it's very easy to miss the clouds briefly forming a smiling face across the moon.    My only serious reservation with the new version is the annoying and inappropriate vocalizing  that is heard at the beginning of the closing credits completely dispelling the atmosphere left by Danny Elfman's superb score.

B000VR824S|5.0|This is the most enjoyable music dvd/blue-ray that I own.    It appears from Clapton's comments in introducing Stevie Winwood that this was the first time they had played together in 25 years, since the brief days of the incredible Blind Faith. Hearing and seeing them play Presence of he Lord, Can't Find My Way Home, and Had to Cry Today was and is a thrill, their duets are new and touching. Clapton is in his highest form, absolutely fantastic soloing. I Had to Cry Today in total ecstasy. I suspect that the obvious joy and creative remembering here resulted in their touring together and their great Madison Sq. Garden DVD show.     The performance by John McLaughlin of Maharina is worth the price of the entire DVD. His mastery of the guitar, perhaps especially stimulated by this guitar festival, and passionate engagement in the song produces a rich emotional range. The piece soars and rocks so much more than the version on the Floating Point CD. It is one of the high points of my 45 years of listening to and being touched by great rock and jazz.    I've never seen Jeff Beck before, but this is another just fantastic thing to see and feel. Beck, like McLaughlin, takes us on a complex emotional ride. His guitar is slashing and filled with inner deeper drama. If I had to compare Beck with any other musician, it would be Miles Davis. Same tense genius. Very impressive.     Other highlights: BB King singin' and playin' Rock Me Baby, Clapton & Crew playing Crossroads, Clapton singing Isn't It a Pity. These plenty of other good stuff here, and some stuff that doesn't do anything for me after one or two listening.     This is a great set of moments in Rock History.
B003Y5H4SY|4.0|I came in with no prior knowledge and expectations about the film, but when it ended I had the following thoughts:<br />1. It was a well written film.<br />2.

If you are debating between which copy to buy, get the Hardback copy, I do not think you'll regret it.<br /><br /> \\"The most dangerous sicknesses are those that make us believe we are well\\"  You don't get a choice if you want the procedure or not, you get limited choices of all the decisions you make, and your every move is watched over by the regime. Lena Holloway's mother did not take to the procedure and was taken away. Lena is just weeks from her procedure and has never considered anything different that the ways of her normal everyday life, Until..Alex appears.<br /><br />  Delirium by Lauren Oliver is a Romeo and Juliet story that is not disappointing. It will keep you engaged and thinking about your life in a whole new way. Sure Love can be a sickness, but without it can we really call ourselves human?<br /><br />  I am not a fan of romance books, but this book about what love is, left me wanting more.
B001DCQIAA|5.0|I sometimes still hear someone saying that Schumann was not a good orchestrator and that his symphonies have a problem here and there. Obviously if they hear this recording they will realize the masterpieces that the Schumann symphonies are. For me, these symphonies are way more interesting than the ones from Brahms and Schubert.<br /><br />It is obvious that Karajan really loved Schumann. Every breath on each one of these symphonies is inspired. I tried some other recent recordings to take advantage of the digital sound, but none came close to the drama and lyricism of this recording.
B000FC2PKG|3.0|Lisa Gardner is a competent writer and that shows in this novel. It reads well. The writing is professional. A quick run-down on the plot is that Officer Dodge, a police sniper, shoots a man during a hostage situation. He is then suspended from the police. The plot probably gets overly complex and convoluted to the point of getting difficult to follow in spots, and I am not at all sure the motivations of the dead husband's family is credible. I didn't really find it so. But that wasn't my biggest problem with the novel. The biggest problem was that none of the characters is likable, or even sympathetic, including the protagonist.    Eventually, you want some character in the whole thing who you at least feel some empathy about or at least care about a little bit. I never found one. By the end, my reaction was, \\"Who cares?\\"
0316098337|4.0|Great premise for this book based on horror stories taken from recent headlines.  It captures your interest immediately and makes you want to quickly get through to the end to see what becomes of Jack and his mother.  I thought the author did a good job on the ending by showing the mother doing what was absolutely necessary for Jack to get some sort of closure from the ordeal, even though it was very painful for her.      One thing that bugged me:  the author never disclosed what Ma's \\"real\\" name was.  I'm not sure why the author never tells the reader her name or why it bugged me, but it did!    Great, fast, and interesting read.
0439023521|5.0|Suzanne Collins certainly ups the bar for Young Adult fiction with \\"HUNGER GAMES.\\"  This story is extremely unique, exciting and very engaging.  The character development is superb and the action sequences are amazing.  This novel (and series) will appeal to readers of all ages, young or old.<br /><br />Set in the near-future, Panem (the country occupying most of North America) is an oppressive, communist style government which subjects its citizens to an annual event known as the \\"Hunger Games.\\"  Participants must be between the ages of 12 and 18 and are chosen from a \\"lottery\\" in each of the country's twelve districts.  The Games are a cruel and vicious fight to the death--24 participants begin and only one can emerge victorious.<br /><br />The story is told through the voice of the main character and narrator, Katniss.  Originally, her younger sister was chosen via lottery to compete in the Hunger Games, however Katniss volunteers to take her place (and face almost certain death.)  The majority of the novel covers the Hunger Games themselves, though Collins masterfully develops her characters both inside and outside of the arena.<br /><br />I won't share any spoilers, but being the first of three novels, you should expect some room for further plot development, character growth and unanswered questions.  To be honest, I feel like this book stands on its own quite nicely.  I'm not really sure how the plot lends itself to a solid sequel (or trilogy) but I will certainly consider reading the second two installments.<br /><br />One of the best young adult fiction novels that I have read lately! Highly Recommended! A+

I have seen some reviewers who said they didn't like the book because it was depressing.  Well, if you are the type of reader who only wants to read books that are all or mostly happy, upflifting, and  positive...than this is NOT the book for you.  This is a book that is full of sadness, but the sadness is intertwined with immense humor, hope, love, and some of the best storytelling you will find.    This is a book that will stay with you long, long after you finish it.  Highly, highly recommended for all except those who can't handle a book with sadness.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|In reading the reviews here, I'm utterly speechless at some of the commentary bashing this film.  So it's not 100 percent historically accurate.  So we haven't met some of the original players personally.  Some complained of the gospel music playing as the horse crossed the finish line at Belmont.  They didn't \\"get\\" it.  I suggest they watch the film again because if they don't \\"get it\\" they missed a very important earlier scene.    There's an underlying story here of hope and redemption that is far more important for those not old enough to remember the events precisely as they happened. We're currently living in a country where it seems we have so few opportunities and so little to hope for.  This is a movie about taking chances and coming out on top.  No foul language, no violence and it's beautifully filmed. Penny Tweedy went from being a housewife to a being a woman no one really believed in - except Secretariat.  Lucian Lauren felt like a loser, but he saw a drive in both her and the horse that compelled him to come back.  And this was a horse that was more interested in eating and sleeping than in running, or so they thought. What they couldn't know, was the competitive spirit that resided within the heart of a champion. Forget history.  Pretend like you never read the book and you've never heard of this horse.  No, it's not \\"Sea Biscuit\\".  It's not supposed to be Sea Biscuit.  It's a different kind of story and if you'll allow yourself to just let go, it will be one of the most pleasant and rewarding experiences one can ever have watching a movie.  Take the kids.  Take your parents.  Take the whole family.  You'll walk away with your heart a little lighter than when you started and that's what a movie is supposed to do.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|I loved this movie when I saw it back in October of last year. And I love it just the same on DVD. Firstly, I could have never expected the juicy narrative of the young dudes that created this unbelievable online phenomenon. But to see their characters unfold is a delicious detail you'll never get in gleaning one's superficial Facebook page, that's for sure. And it's this contrast that makes it so juicy!     Zuckerberg is a real anti-social creep--yet here he is creating a place online where everybody can list and communicate with their college buddies...everyone but him, of course. He's the typical nerd-type with a disdainful essence. In comes his close friend who gets fried, the handsome, aristocratic twin brothers who get swindled and you have some amazing drama.    Oh, the irony of it all!    This must win Best Picture--for all the social nuance implied and for the truly perspicacious insight into the inner workings of all the players--not just peach-fuzz- face, Zuckerberg.    No wonder I'm one of the very few who has declined being one of the many on that overly successful website! Non-comformists unite!

B0015DROBO|4.0|When Journalist Mikael Blomkvist loses his battle against corrupt financier Wennerstrom and is convicted of libel, he makes several decisions that will affect the next year of his life.  He briefly decides to separate himself from Millennium, the magazine he publishes, and after much thought, agrees to sign a contract with octogenarian Henrik Vanger to pursue the cold case of his missing grandniece, Harriet.  He goes to stay in a cottage on the island and family compound while he works.<br /><br />More than thirty years before, Harriet had gone missing from the island where the family resides, and despite the efforts of the police, no trace of her has been found.  There are many boxes full of files, however, which Mikael begins to sort through.<br /><br />Meanwhile, in another story arc, a young woman named Lisbeth Salander has prepared an investigative report on Mikael Blomkvist for a client.  A freelance worker for a securities firm, she is able to excel at what she does best--brilliant investigative work, utilizing computer hacking skills, while not having to deal with her issues with authority.  She is a mysterious person with secrets of her own.<br /><br />In the process of the \\"wild goose chase\\" of searching for new leads, Blomkvist decides he needs an investigative assistant to help him, and takes on Lisbeth Salander as his associate--after discovering that she prepared a report on him prior to Vanger's offer to him.  Her thoroughness impressed him.<br /><br />The two of them soon find some leads, and a lot more clues that suggest a serial killer may be on the loose.  Meanwhile, someone nearby on the island is sending very dark messages which suggest that the two may have zeroed in on some of the answers.<br /><br />What thread are the investigators beginning to unravel, and how does it connect to Harriet's disappearance?  What unexpected danger lurks nearby?<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0015DROBO The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]] was a thrill ride that kept me reading late into the night.

B003VIW8E4|5.0|The immersion edition of Bryan Ferry's haunting and lush \\"Olympia\\" is obviously meant to dazzle the eyes and ears. Sheathed in a hard case, the limited edition large format photo book of Kate Moss' fashion shoot for the collection is used as backdrop for the lyrics, which show a richer maturity to Ferry's lyric writing. In the back of the book in a dye cut sleeve are three disks: the original album mix with two bonus tracks; a second cd with seven alternative mixes; and a dvd of the making of \\"Olympia.\\"<br /><br />As far as packaging aesthetics, the presentation is elegant yet simple, with excellent paper stock, flawless printing and vigorous binding. The only drawback: the dye cut sleeve in the back is not as sturdy, so special attention to removing and replacing the disks is necessary to avoid rips.<br /><br />As for the content, this feels like Ferry back to what he does best in a big way, and for any fan, the additional cost will be worth it. The bonus tracks, \\"Whatever Gets You Through the Night,\\" and \\"One Night,\\" fit seamlessly with the original 10 tracks, though they don't really add anything new to the songs that go before it. The dvd is a nice addition, a fascinating look at Ferry's writing and recording process, though it can bog down to some degree in its own detail. The alternative mix cd, however, is what puts this version of \\"Olympia\\" over the top. These are mostly brilliant remixes, revealing a new level of texture and meaning to the seven songs recast from the originals. The disk seems to get better from start to finish, with the last three tracks--\\"Shameless\\" (Still Going Mix), \\"BF Bass (Ode to Olympia)\\" (West End Wolf Mix), and an instrumental version of \\"Reason or Rhyme\\" that contains impassioned solo piano by Ferry that may be his best ever--are stunningly intoxicating, and represent higher standards for what a Bryan Ferry song can become.<br /><br />For those of us who most admire Ferry's work on \\"Avalon,\\" \\"Boys and Girls,\\" \\"Bete Noire,\\" \\"Mamouna\\" (flawed but underestimated) and \\"Taxi\\" (an underappreciated gem of covers), \\"Olympia\\" is a return to form but not a repeat performance. This is solid songwriting a la Ferry's peculiar brand of Euro lounge dance/rock, inspired playing and production, his most cohesive set of songs since \\"Bete Noire.\\"<br /><br />Take the time to read the lyrics. This is some of his most poignant, nuanced lyric writing, revealing the anguish lurking behind the beautifully layered instrumentation. A bravura performance in a package to match.

B0019FOC5E|3.0|I am a huge fan of ABBA and I loved the Broadway show.  This movie is average because of the poor casting.  Meryl Steep is really too old for the role, Pierce Brosnan cannot sing at all, it's painful watching him try.  The only thing that makes it worth watching is the beautiful scenery and costumes.  If you love ABBA songs, you will enjoy hearing them but not the delivery unfortunately.
B003JYOEYM|1.0|The characters are not even anti-hero survivalist with any kind of plan or common sense. If this scenario were to happen for real you can bet I would not be wasting ammo, worrying about worthless money and shooting people I come across in the woods for no reason (i.e. the rednecks they encounter.) I cannot believe how stupid and naive people in this film are about the zombies. They don't even pick up their dead commrades weapons or gear which would be critical in such a situation. The classic fued scenario would have made a good subplot in a better script, but here it is just plain silly. I imagine Romero is trying to build up to Evolution of the Dead or something like that based on the last several films, but he needs a big budget like he had for Land of the Dead to pull it off. I would like to see another film where scientist have made a breakthrough and can restore the dead to full functioning people again or even breed them into a new species. We want to see a new direction here.

0061726826|5.0|Lena has waited almost her entire life for the day when she will turn eighteen and can finally have the cure, the procedure which will take away that horrible, horrible disease amor deliria nervosa--or, love. Everyone tells her that being without love is so much easier, and she'll be much happier, and Lena readily believes them, not wanting to be like her mother, who resisted the cure and eventually committed suicide, causing her to become a social outcast in her community. But her entire life changes the summer before her procedure takes place when she meets Alex. He's sweet and kind, and oddly mysterious. He makes Lena feel things she can't name, things that she knows are dangerous. And before she can realize it, she's fallen in love.    Like with her debut, Before I Fall, Lauren Oliver wields a mesmerizing power over her readers in her latest book. Delirium and the world it is set in is fascinating--it's much like our own, only with the absence of love people are controlled by the government in being told who they must marry, and are kept in a caste-like social system to keep order, but really everyone's lives are empty and meaningless without the love needed to generate all of the passionate emotions and bring about change. Instead, that is left to the younger generations without the cure, like Lena. As she fumbles through life, acting on impulses she can't understand that the reader knows to be love, Lena slowly begins to recognize and fully comprehend what exactly love is--romantic, familial, and platonic--and how very essential it is to life. The majority of the book isn't necessarily about her romance with Alex or a revolution in thinking, but about Lena's journey toward acceptance of love and knowing that life is meaningless without it. In the process, she comes to understand her mother and her motivations, and uncovers some startling and ugly secrets. Oliver wraps up the novel with a joyful, gut-wrenching, bittersweet conclusion that is just open enough for the possibility of a sequel, but more importantly emphasizes the power of love and makes you carefully consider what most of us take for granted. Once again, Oliver has written tremendous, intoxicating book readers will devour.    Cover Comments: I like the light blue of the cover a lot, and how the title and author's name are formed from the cut-out with the girl in the background. It's such a neat effect!
B001O80G60|4.0|I just started my mp3 collection and yes i'm a little behind. This is one of my favorite albums and I was very dissapointed that the version of By Demons Be Driven was the remix version. I really don't understand why.

You guys at Amazon need to get your stuff straight or is it the fault of a vendor or distributor? What ever the case I'm kind of upset about it
B003YK42LQ|3.0|KOL's followers are usually divided into two groups: Those who listened from the beginning and fell in love with the raw, original southern rock sound and lead singer Caleb Followill's unique voice, coming out obscurity, swinging a bat made of unhindered, unheard of and unrefined creative rock. Then there's the camp that probably listens to \\"mix\\" radio stations, which usually consists of preteens and teens, whom caught on after \\"Only By the Night.\\" That pretty much sums it up. It sucks, because I really WANT to like Kings of Leon, but just cannot after the last two records. They've abandoned what made them different in favor of a sound that sells records, tickets, and merchandise. I will say I like this record better than Only By the Night. Some of the grit is back, but only in the lyrics, and not in the actual sound. I guess this is inevitable, there has never been too many bands that hold on to what made them great in the first place, and make a career out of it spanning several years. Surprise, surprise.
B004M8AO9S|5.0|What a great episode! Just when you think you know all about the characters, the story lines reveal more. Ian Somerhalder was so gorgeous, sexy, exciting, dangerous (isn't he always?)- and yes - vulnerable. Although, he was pretty vulnerable in Episode 12.  And the shower and bathtub scenes - I felt my heart would stop! Let's have more! Not to slight Paul Wesley, he was strong but also so sweet.  I want Damon to be a little bit good for Elena, but not too good.  After all, don't we all love the bad boy?
B0049P1VHS|5.0|++++  NO SPOILERS ++++    I love horror and outre film and television, but, no pun intended, I thought until \\"The Walking Dead\\" that the zombie genre was a played out mining town.  Starting far back with Bela Lugosi's fantastic \\"White Zombie\\" all the way up through the masterpiece \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" and ending in satire with the hilarious \\"Army of Darkness\\" and \\"Shaun of the Dead,\\" I thought myself to be on safe ground in this harshly critical assessment.  Sometimes, it's a pleasure to be flat wrong.     I watched all six episodes of this, and cannot wait for the next season.  It's an ensemble acting piece, so focus never lingers too long on any one particular character.  This is a brilliant opening gambit for television since the viewer can, in a way, vicariously share the dread of \\"just getting to know someone\\" and then have them ripped away, either by the evil of men, mischance, or zombie attack.  Some think that the acting is contrived.  I do not.  All of the characters are on edge, just up to the point of hysteria, and played consistently thus.  True, it can make for one-note dialogue and predictable, archetypal situations, but what other notes might there be in the opening month of the end of the world, and a world not only ending but grown hideously hostile to boot?  It will be interesting to see how the actors manage the change into something \\"else\\" as they adapt to a zombie-filled world, and I hope they are up to the challenge.  From the looks of things thus far, they are.      And this makes the title especially provocative.  One would assume that \\"The Walking Dead\\" refers to zombies.  I am not sure of that at all.  Here, the undead are the backdrop to the action, not the action itself.  The action lies in the excellent ensemble acting and cleverly turned scripting.  It may well unfold that the living are the ones who end up truly meriting that disturbing title, not the once-human shambling mounds of flesh haunting the desolate streets of \\"Necropolis Atlanta.\\"  I have an odd suspicion that by the end of season two, the mindless juggernaut of zombie hordes will be a pale shadow compared to the darker and more malevolent forces that can shape the human soul into something far more fearful and terrifying.  And these six shows set up that subtle possibility with suprising elegance as the normal turns suddenly abnormal and the \\"brave new world\\" or both urban and rural America comes bloodily undone.      This is not a show for the faint of heart.  The make-up and effects for television are very well done and almost entirely convincing.  The adult situations, profanity, and desperate sexuality also make \\"The Walking Dead\\" unsuitable for minors.  But for adults, this is nothing less than a treat and not a \\"guilty pleasure.\\"      So spread the word.  Zombies are back, and very scary again.  Almost as scary as the people trying to outlive them.  Five stars.

1594202842|5.0|What's been missing in the publicity about this book is the fact that Amy Chua has a bitingly ironic sense of humor that kept me laughing all the way through it.  I was raised by tiger parents, and trust me, she is dead-on when she describes the immigrant Chinese approach to parenting.  She went a little overboard on the whole thing, to be sure (I wouldn't have wanted to be her kid) but every Chinese kid I grew up with did indeed play the piano and/or violin, played it well, went to college, and ended up with a professional degree.  Not to say that these households didn't endure similar screaming matches and slammed doors, as Chua's did.  She's a gifted enough writer to make the tension in her household come vividly to life on the page - to the point that, yes, I can actually see the beads of sweat break out on her husband's face as he cringes before the next explosion of tempers at the dinner table.    What most impresses me about tiger parenting is how much energy and devotion it requires.  I admit, I didn't follow through with my own kids because of sheer exhaustion.  So even though we may condemn Ms. Chua for being rigid and controlling, we must also salute her for being utterly devoted to her children.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I truely enjoy science fiction. I believe it is the most imaginative of all film genre. This series was the most entertaining for me because it had such a human touch. The characters were easy to identify with. I was sorry to see the series end.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The Dark Knight is an amazing work of art. I mean it's almost as if the comic book characters this film is based on have leapt off the pages of my favorite DC Comic series and onto my television screen. However, this isn't a review of the film itself, so I'll stick the the features I both love and hate about the Blu-ray disc.    The best thing about this disc, as with any Blu-ray disc I imagine, is the crisp vibrant clarity it offers. At full 1080p resolution you kind of have to expect it, right? What makes this particular disc different from most I've seen is that there is no \\"main menu\\" in any traditional sense. When you place this movie into your Blu-ray player the movie starts up right away and the menu can be called up by just pressing the menu button on your remote. I love this feature, and it make sense to me, since I'm the type that doesn't want to be bothered with previews and menus anyway. I just want to get to movie! The special features can be integrated into the film, which I also love as I have a desire to know every single behind the scenes moment of all my favorite films. What better way to see them than integrated into the scenes they're related to? Unfortunately the BD-live features weren't much to rant and rave about. Actually I can't think of one worth mentioning off the top of my head.    So, what about the bad? To be perfectly honest I hate that the special features don't really go in-depth enough. I'd like to know about why they chose to portray certain characters the way they did, maybe something about the writing process from David Goyer. There's nothing wrong with the information given about the film or the current special features. They just seem too surface material for me. Not enough in-depth info given. This, of course, is just a personal gripe. The special features are good enough that I'm sure they will please most fans.

B003Y5HWJU|5.0|Atlantic City, 1920. The war has just ended, Prohibition has just started, and a new breed of criminal is on the rise.<br /><br />Based on the true-life story of Enoch &#34;Nucky&#34; Johnson, this brilliant HBO series brutally kicks aside any romantic notions we might have had about the flappers'n'bathtub-gin era of American history. It's bloody, sexual, and full of cruel ruthless men who are saved from being TOTALLY despicable by little acts of kindness.<br /><br />Enoch &#34;Nucky&#34; Thompson (Steve Buscemi) is the unofficial boss of Atlantic City. While officially only the state treasurer, he actually has his fingers in every business in the city -- and now that Prohibition has started, he's also the boss of the bootlegging biz in New Jersey. His creepy brother is the sheriff, so he basically controls the cops as well.<br /><br />However, his &#34;boardwalk empire&#34; is constantly under threat. His protoge Jimmy (Michael Pitt) is involved in a whiskey robbery that ends up becoming a huge bloody mess, and soon fanatical Prohibition agent Van Allen (Michael Shannon) arrives to uncover what REALLY happened. So now Nucky must fend off the Feds, as well as dealing with a lynched black gangster, boardwalk thefts, the &#34;Celtic Dinner,&#34; and weeks of pre-election politicking.<br /><br />And while all this is going on, Nucky is forced to play hardball with Jimmy, who is now wanted by the New York mob. He also becomes acquainted with Margaret Schroeder (Kelly Macdonald), a lovely young Irish widow who appeals to Nucky in a way his sleazy showgirl mistress does not.<br /><br />There are only twelve episodes of &#34;Boardwalk Empire Season 1,&#34; and somehow that's never quite enough -- they're packed with so much blood, sex, politics, murder, booze and subterfuge that it's dizzying to watch. And there are at least a dozen intricate subplots, all of which are constantly changing from one episode to the next.<br /><br />And the writers are unafraid to unleash some really graphic violence (head blown off, severed fingers, a shooting where the guy's BLOOD SPLATTERS ON THE CAMERA LENS), as well as exploring the ugly underbelly of this glamorized age. The dialogue is strong, quick and peppered with the F-word, and the characters are outlined carefully by the stories they often tell (such as Chalky informing a KKK jerk about how his dad died).<br /><br />And how do they manage to make us actually LIKE these cruel, ruthless characters like Nucky, Jimmy and Luciano? Well, just when you're preparing to hate them... they suddenly reveal a soft spot for premature babies, or they tear up about their deaf child. Steve Buscemi is absolutely wonderful as Nucky -- he's a wise-cracking, politically savvy bootlegger, but you do NOT want to cross this guy.<br /><br />And there are some great smaller performances by the pretty-faced Pitt, Macdonald, Shannon, Shea Wigham, Stephen Graham, and a lot of other solid actors. The one downside? Paz de la Huerta as Nucky's mistress Daisy -- she's basically there to lounge around naked in almost every scene, whining in a creepy little-girl voice about random topics.<br /><br />&#34;Boardwalk Empire Season 1&#34; is a rich, amazingly-written slice of American history -- that is, the American history that is often glossed over because of its ugliness.

030746363X|1.0|What a dissapointment.  I have NO faith in anything in the book.  My copy will go into the trash----  will not pass on to my kids.  In fact, don't want them to know I read it.
1600108512|4.0|This just released hardcover collects the six issue series from 2010 in a very nice package.  Based on the 1968 novel of the same name by Peter S. Beagle, this adaptation is written by Peter B. Gillis with art by Renae De Liz and Ray Dillon, this book is something to behold.  With no dust jacket, like so many hardcovers in the graphic novel and reprint genre, this book even feels a bit like the family friendly material it comes from.  I remember many of the children's books from growing up that looked and felt just like this, and found that very inviting.  It's only as boring old adults that we get books with dust jackets and slip covers.  This book feels special in your hands.    Having said that, I should also say that I have never read the novel and have only a passing knowledge of the 1982 movie.  I have no preconceived ideas about what this book should be.  That is, in my opinion, the only way to review something.  Judge it as itself.  You cannot compare it to the movie or the novel because it is not either of these things, in the same way you cannot make a fair comparison between relate genre material like the Watchmen comic and the movie of the same name.  There are similarities because they share the same concept and general story framework, but serve two completely different masters.  In this case, the novel is the novel, the movie a movie, and this graphic novel is a stand alone work in a medium that asks different things of itself to become what it is.  And what this is takes the form of an interesting comic that owes a heavy debt to its predecessors.    But those debts will be covered in a minute.  This is the story of the last of the magical creatures known as unicorns. This unicorn decides to leave its place of safety and solitude to search the world and see if it truly is the last of its kind.  She meets a variety of characters along the way that led her through to the end of the quest and a confrontation with the red bull and the king that controls its power.  The story is laden with metaphor, both intended by the author and those which the reader will bring to the experience.To tell much more would be to spoil the story.  There is very little in this story that will come as a surprise to most adults, but that is not the point here.  The real point here is what the reader brings to the story will determine what he or she gets out of it.  While that is true of most any fiction, it is particularly the case here.  Younger children will not have the same experience here that an adult will have.    The most obvious of the debts is to the movie itself.  As a medium that relies as heavily on visuals, as comics do, it is no surprise that the visual storytelling style of the book draws heavily from the film.  At times, too much so.  The art is uneven at times, showing an odd depth of field in some shots, and some of the figures and characters look like they were meant to be animated rather than drawn static.  Also occasionally the line is oddly heavy where there is no specific need.  It is possibly dealing with something from the source material that I am not catching. This all reads as though the creators of this adaptation could not ( or would not) let go of the movie when visualizing the book.  That is not a bad thing at all, just a choice on the creators part that didn't work for me.   Other than that, minor quibble, the book is gorgeous!.  The color palette is as rich as it should be in a magical world.  There is no part of this package that isn't stunning.  From that standpoint, this book is worth every penny of the $25 cover price.    I think this book would be more enjoyable to people who recall the movie more fondly than the original novel.  Someone with no background in either, age depending, may find this a bit light and even predictable.  But anyone that enjoys the old style of fantasy and magical worlds story, will enjoy this for what it is, a fine fairy tale world, brought vividly to life on the page.  [...]

030746363X|2.0|I bought this book from Amazon.com for about $14. That was a HUGE waste of $14.  The info Dr. Oz shared about this book on his show was better organized than the book.  So if, like me, you're considering buying it based on what you heard on Dr. Oz, save your money. Just watch the video about it on DoctorOz.com.<br /><br />Why didn't I like this book?  It reads like someone just threw it together.  It's very unorganized, hard to follow, not well thought out, and basically, just a mind dump of disjointed ideas.<br /><br />Little tiny tidbits, almost teasers, come through, like eat within 30 minutes of getting up.  But later in the book, it says it's OK to eat within an hour of getting up.  Another tidbit:  eat eggs as soon as you get up for maximum impact.  A few hundred pages later, Tim says he eats 4 brazil nuts and a tablespoon of almond butter as soon as he gets up.  Which is it?  Eggs or nuts?  Those are just 2 minor examples of the major frustration I experienced while reading this book.

It also puts together a number of examples that puts together other technologies to effectively use the new features. This one now belongs to my overhead shelf for easy access anytime :)
1594202842|5.0|As a book, it creates a very authentic perspective on 'The Chinese Mother' way of raising kids. If you take that for what it is, it's a great read and I enjoyed it since I could see my own mother in her style of parenting. While not all Chinese Mothers are so draconian, the rudimentary principles certainly lays the foundation for the way many of my Chinese friends and I were raised (my words, not the author's):    * NEVER question your parents authority  * NEVER be disrespectful to your elders  * NEVER cause your parents embarrassment  * Make them proud     It didn't matter what socio-economic level you were. Most Chinese kids had these rules (said or unsaid) set out to them at an early age. The need to please and make your parents proud was more important than life itself, literally.     Is this the 'right' way of raising kids? It's not a step-by-step guide and it shouldn't be taken like that. It's a peek into another culture--a slice and not the whole picture.

From the variety of material she performed to the way she performed it, the total experience of Believe was thoroughly pleasant and enjoyable.  I also had the pleasure of seeing Katherine Jenkins live in concert where she performed many of the same songs as on the DVD and then had the privelege of meeting her after the show.  She is as pleasant as she is talented.  I think that Sarah Brightman has some serious competition!  Any fan of classical-crossover would enjoy thid DVD, even if they hadn't heard of Ms. Jenkins.

B003UESJH4|5.0|About every few years, a performance of exceptional depth, meaning, and transcendence crosses film and television screens, hopefully reminding us how powerful the medium can be to show us something about ourselves. Although these exceptional performances often concern historical figures, what they portray is the very human side of people we think of as being nearly timeless. Some which come to mind include Vivian Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara, Glenda Jackson as Queen Elizabeth I, Ben Kingsley as Gandhi, Sean Penn as Harvey Milk, Forest Whitaker as Idi Amin, Helen Mirren as Elizabeth II, Paul Giamatti as John Adams, and Denzel Washington as Malcolm X. In 2010, this honor has to belong to Colin Firth as King George VI in \\"The King's Speech\\".<br /><br />The reason I believe \\"The King's Speech\\" is the best picture along with the best performance of 2010 lies not exclusively with Firth's outstanding performance as King George VI, which is exemplary by any standard. The whole tone and atmosphere of the King's Speech is about the English monarchy revealed. Within the high palace walls and glorious banners which have flown for centuries reside fallible human beings. These people, despite the limos and the embroidered ermine, have the same hopes, fears, challenges, and shortcomings which we all share. This film is about one of those born into what seems, from the outside, a life of pure splendor and privilege, and how that person had to cope with very serious shortcomings considering his position in British society.<br /><br />When he is born the second son of the man who would become King George V, it was understood that Bertie would never become King of Great Britain. His brother Edward was the heir presumptive and remained so until the mid-1930's. Bertie (Colin Firth), since early life, had a stammer (or stutter) while speaking, particularly in public situations. As I don't know this history, it sounds like his stammer wasn't taken so seriously because he would never be seated on the throne. But after a disastrous public-speaking engagement at Wembley Stadium in the 1920's, he seeks professional help. His wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) comes across a reputed speech therapist Lionel Logue (Jeffrey Rush in an equally compelling performance) who helped impaired World War I veterans regain their voices. Logue is a kind of real-life Professor Higgins (Pygmalion/My Fair Lady), although his intent is to help those with speech impediments.<br /><br />At first, Bertie wishes only to work on the physical aspects of speech with his new therapist. Logue agrees, provided their relationship is equal behind closed doors. The two work intensely every day to help the future monarch loosen his jaw, enunciate, and breathe more properly. But as the sessions progress and Logue learns more about his high-ranking client/patient, a deeper relationship emerges. And we begin to learn that Bertie did experience ill-treatment as a child which contributed to his stammer. The therapist realizes there is more to Bertie's stammer than mere physical defects.<br /><br />When his brother abdicates the throne in 1936, suddenly Bertie becomes George VI, King of England and Britain. I think George VI is one of the unsung heroes of World War II, often overshadowed by Churchill, Roosevelt and de Gaulle. Although he may have not engaged in a great act of heroism on the field, his willingness to improve himself because of his obligations as Britain's Head of State is a courageous act. His ability to communicate will become the voice of reassurance and resolve among the English-speaking world along with Churchill and Roosevelt against the fascist forces in Europe. A very slow but deliberate transformation occurs throughout the film in which Bertie is at first shy and nervous until he exceeds even his own expectations and becomes worthy to fill the shoes of those before him, worn by the likes of Queen Elizabeth I, King Charles II, Queen Victoria, King Edward VII, and his father King George V.<br /><br />A president doesn't exactly become president when he swears his oath of office, nor a king when he is crowned. These people become fused with their roles when they rise above their deficiencies and face their obstacles head on. As the man who wasn't supposed to be king, George VI rose to the occasion, shortcomings and all. At one point, his speech therapist says \\"You're the most courageous man I know.\\" And that is the mark of a great man, king or otherwise.ent doesn't exactly become president when he swears his oath of office, nor a king when he is crowned.

This DVD/Blu Ray combo contains a ton of interesting bonus features, they did a really nice job with it.

[\\"The Simpsons\\" first season came out on DVD late 2001, \\"Friends\\" in 2002.] That is one reason they had to get rid of most of the original music because it would have been expensive to get it back.     Other than that everything looks great, and any fan of Daria or animation should own this!
0316098337|5.0|Emma Donoghue's latest novel, Room, is told from the perspective of Jack, a five-year-old boy who has lived his whole life inside \\"Room\\" with his mother, Ma. Having Jack narrate is a clever device: through his innocent eyes and ears, we gradually learn how he and Ma come to be in this situation and what fills their days. We share Jack's thoughts about daily life and his fear at the thought of escape and the attempt to carry it out. Altogether, it makes for horror, humour, hope, suspense and sadness. I really enjoyed this book. I laughed, I cried, and at one stage, the tension was so high, I did the reading equivalent of putting your hands in front of your eyes in a scary movie: I had to walk away for a break. Apart from that, I found it hard to put down and I am sure many will read it in one sitting. Heartbreaking in parts, it was ultimately a truly uplifting novel.
0802473156|5.0|LOVE THIS BOOK! It's wonderful for helping with communication and understanding how communication conflicts can happen. It's not a be-all end-all type book but it's a good book that can help couples have more understanding in their relationship.

B004CLYKLI|5.0|I think she did a great job explaining what she believes she did right, what she did wrong, and what she'd change versus what she wouldn't change. Amy, if you are reading this.. Don't sweat the hard-heads. They just want to dis you. American kids these days are entitled, selfish, arrogant, and SUPER LAZY!! In this country parents use the TV to parent a lot of times and the are \\"too tired\\" to do the real job of parenting. So, why did you all have kids if you can't or won't be a real parent? I applaud this book and thankful that someone has finally shown a different side of parenting. Our country is behind many others in education because of the lack of discipline and parenting skills. We should hold our (American) kids to a higher standard, and we should expect more from them. In this world and in this country, life is not easy and if you want to get ahead you have to be smart and well-rounded. As adults we complete for jobs, and it's not any different for teens who compete for scholarships, admission to college, etc. Why wouldn't we start them young with ambition, drive and internal motivation? Why wouldn't we tell them what is and what is NOT acceptable? It does not mean the love is not there. The LOVE is there, and it is shown in the presence of a parent willing to take time out of their \\"busy schedules\\" to hold their child accountable and to actually PARENT.<br />Amen Chua! Amen!

Granted, this is 2003 DVD packaging, so it's already a bit outdated. The series consists of 6 discs, and the dvd box is the size of a small dictionary. (Includes a cute little episode guide, by the way, which is nothing special.) There are 3 plastic dvd holders inside the box, holding one dvd on each side, and these holders are themselves the size of regular single-disc dvd boxes. Glue from 2003 clearly does not hold through 2011, as the plastic holders have unbonded from the binding and will fall out if you are not careful. However, the dvds themselves are in perfect condition, so there's really not too much to complain about besides aesthetics. Let's all just be glad that packaging DVDs has improved in the past 8 years.
B002ZG98Z0|3.0|I loved the first movie and was hoping the 2nd would be just as good, but I was deff disappointed.    1. The gay wedding is so unnecessary, I'm gay and was totally offended by the whole thing......it was so stereotypical and over the top....I was cringing the whole time especially when Liza sang! Not to mention that scene is way too long.    2. It's a little bit boring, there's not enough going on plot wise.    3. Samantha is a little too much, I usually love her but some of her antics in this movie were less than desirable.....like the condom scene towards the end.....that one vividly comes to mind as one of the worst.    4. Not enough NYC!    On the positive side the movie has some fun parts, I loved most of the girl's vacation and when you've just watched the first movie and are really in a Sex And The City mood this movie will be nice to pop in.
B00493AD74|1.0|There is a reason why this movie costs so little to \\"rent\\" on Amazon.com in comparison to the rest of the videos that came out around the same time. I wanted to like it but I have to echo what the other reviews said about it. It was almost impossible to empathize with anything this woman was feeling, hard to relate to anything in this story. This story should have been titled \\"How much I love myself\\". The main character is self absorbed, irrational and unreasonable. She wanders far and wide to find herself and \\"marvel\\" at something, and throws away everything she has ever worked for and hurts people that did not deserve to be hurt. An important message in this movie was that in order to change how you feel you must change how you think. and yes it is very difficult. You do not have to take a trip around the world to teach yourself to love honestly, to be true to yourself or to find spirituality. I would suggest this movie if you have two hours that you really want to waste. If you have read the book (I havent), you may want to watch it. If youre looking for a movie with a deeper message then dont waste your time or money.
0525951652|5.0|This was a terrific book; absorbing, with great characters.  Follet has done it again (ie., \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and \\"World Without End\\").  Wonderful character development and an incredible sense and knowledge of history.  Recommended highly.  I can't wait for the second book in the trilogy; and then the third.

0618918248|2.0|The book is well written and reads easily. Science, Dawkins' element, is naturally taking center-stage and is presented in a format understandable to non-science readers, which is the audience the book is targeting. On the other hand, philosophy, if considered at all, is either given short shrift or relegated to the status of an evolutionary by-product.<br /><br />Dawkins argues for his science-based atheism with no less of an 'evangelistic' fervor than would some bible-thumper in a revival tent for his cause, and therein I find the biggest flaw in this book: To follow Dawkins all the way and 'ditch' God, you ultimately have to buy into another belief system whether it is called 'humanism', 'scientism', 'secularism' or a yet to be defined 'ism', all capable of developing dogmas just as stifling and potentially dangerous as those of religious creeds. 'Old time religion' (with God) is simply replaced with 'New religion' of science (without God)?<br /><br />There are numerous sections in the book, where the author strays in my opinion. A glaring one is the ridiculous and lengthy discussion about whether Hitler and Stalin were atheists. Who really cares, other than perhaps some angst-ridden atheist readers, who need to be reassured by Dawkins that, even if they were, their minds must surely have been twisted by their religious backgrounds! More useful would have been the examination of how the spirit of social Darwinism, Lamarckian ideas, Eugenics, Marxist scientific materialism and other scientific as well as pseudo-scientific findings of the 19th and early 20th century could have paved the way for the two ideologies responsible for the greatest mass murders in the 20th century.<br /><br />To delve into this realm would obviously show that science can be corrupted and twisted by the powers that be just as much as can be done with religious ideas. However, that is not where Dawkins wishes to tread even though he could have done so after his acknowledging the existence of ingrained belief systems acquired for some evolutionary purpose and every now and then 'misfiring'. That is a real pity, because that could have been the opening for a discussion of what, even from an atheistic viewpoint, could be the fatal flaw but at the same time also the great gift we have as humans: to believe, to have hope in something abstract and yet how easy it is to manipulate that need to believe and hope, no matter whether on a religious or secular level.<br /><br />Dawkins appears to have only one aim in 'The God Delusion': To bring down all religion to the level of at best harmless nonsense, as he puts it, or a dangerous delusion capable of almost any depravity. Nowhere do we read about its many positive contributions to society, and for that matter within the Western context, the contribution of the Judeo-Christian tradition to the development of humanism.<br /><br />Dawkins goes out of his way to bring examples of religious crackpots and zealots to make his point, implying that it is somehow through respect and reference for mainstream religion that such groups are possible and can flourish - as if the same could not be said for the extreme fringes of any other group.<br /><br />Dawkins is on more solid ground, when he refrains from such gratuitous attacks and writes like the scientist he is, postulating, questioning, arguing: I find the chapter about the source of morality especially intriguing, because he does not proffer a pat answer, but points out rightly that the Bible and other religions' holy texts cannot be taken as the source of our morality because all of these texts contain mutual incompatibilities as far as morality is concerned and therefore require judgments which had to be developed independently.<br /><br />Summarizing the above, 'The God Delusion' animates thinking about the subject, but its measure is too narrow and ultimately not satisfying. In the end I find too much of the book simply an anti-religious popular-science rant masquerading as a serious critique of theism. Just the right stuff to become a bestseller.
1423113381|1.0|Having loved the Percy Jackson books, I expected that the next books would also be exciting adventures filled with the same wit, humor and suspense as the rest of Rick Riordan's books. I really wanted to like this book, and gave it a lot of chances to catch my interest, reading about two thirds of it before finally giving up. This review is my hope to give an accurate description of why I didn't like this book.    Firstly, let me say that I am very interested in Ancient Egyptian history and mythology. I am not going to say that I think these books should only be about Greek mythology, because there are other as exciting cultures to explore. However, this book felt, to me, like a dull repeat of Percy Jackson with a couple of switches (new characters, new gods, new monsters). But a lot of similar (or basically the same) ideas are introduced.     Let's start with the characters and the basic plot. The story follows two kids, as always, who realize they are destined for greatness (or something along those lines). We have two main characters, who alternate their viewpoints during the chapters: Carter and Sadie Kane.     I never really felt that developing fully three dimensional characters was Riordan's forte, but in Percy Jackson, at least, characters had some funny characteristics or flaws that mostly made up for their simplistic natures. However, I did not find that this was the case with \\"The Red Pyramid.\\" The two main characters are not very interesting, or unique, for that matter. One is Carter Kane, a rather modest and humble boy of fourteen, and his loudmouthed, obnoxious, \\"say-the-first thing-that-come- to-mind-without-considering-whether-its-rude\\" sister, Sadie. Carter lives with his father Julius, an Egyptologist, and travels around the world with him. Sadie was raised by her mother's grandparents in London. Apparently, the childrens' mothers died mysteriously (is that not very common?) and the children were split up. The story begins with Carter and his father going to visit Sadie for the two allowed visiting days. Then, of course, a mysterious event (no spoilers here) happens, and the children are confronted with the secret world there parents have tried sheltered them from.    Neither of the characters was interesting. Carter was very average (but not in a good way!). He was, flatly described, a bore. Sadie on the other hand, is worse. She does have a personality, but it is obnoxious, ignorant (we're talking about someone who thinks the Rosetta Stone is a computer program) and extremely annoying. Unfortunately, she does not have a personality except for the fact she is rude, childish, and has an English accent. Apart from that, she, like Carter, is a dull bore.    Characters, I think, are the most important part of the book. Even the plot, in my opinion, is not extremely important if the characters are real and interesting to read about. But I found myself simply not caring what happened to these two children, and so, finally, I put the book down.    The plot was also annoying. The story alternated between the two children, which sometimes has a nice effect, but in this case it was simple irritating. I could usually tell who was speaking, but it didn't really matter, and it didn't add to the story. Like the Percy Jackson series, the characters were constantly on the run, facing monsters and dilemmas at every turn, and this book followed that format precisely.     Overall, I found this book to be a boring disappointment, and do not recommend it.
B00402FGE4|3.0|Let me begin to say that if you are a fan of the other two Stargate series and expect action adventure science fiction pulp with witty dialog and alien villains aplenty then you will not find this in this series. Stargate Universe is a drama series who happens to be placed on a spaceship, there is little which is similar to other Stargate products in this. To me it seams like the makers of Stargate saw how well Battlestar Galactica did and decided to try to jump on that bandwagon and they have done so with varying degree of luck.<br /><br />The first few episodes for Stargate Universe is horrible, they are long drawn and boring with most of the three episode pilot being about trying to get limestone so they could get the CO2 scrubbers to start working again, if it had not been for  having paid good money for the DVD set I would have stopped watching here, however luckily I stuck with the show as it do pick up further into the season. Now for those of you who might not know what Stargate Universe is about, the series follows a group of people who have been working on how to use the ninth chevron of the Stargate, unfortunately they end up stuck on the other side, the ninth chevron leading to the run down, million years old space ship Destiny which travels through faraway galaxies on an unknown mission. Now the group of random survivors have to try to survive with limited resources on board the ship while trying to find a way home. Every now and then the ship stops allowing the survivors to gate to various planets in search of supplies and other things they might need. Now this sound exiting enough, however 90 percent of the storyline is drama, there are love affairs, attempted murders, pregnancies, infidelity, betrayals and power struggles. In fact this is a space soap opera.<br /><br />One huge problem I have with this series which I do not know if anyone else have noticed but which for me made it really hard to suspend disbelief was the Ancient communication stones, not the devices themselves but how they where used. Now the communication stones allow the user to switch body with another person anywhere in the universe. The survivors use them to keep in contact with Stargate command and generally keep in touch with Earth, fair enough. However they also use them to have sex with lovers and wives and husbands at home or on the ship and this is never mentioned, everyone is just okey with it. I do not know about you, but if someone used my body to have sex with random strangers then I would be rather upset.<br /><br />Ok a few more notes about the series. Stargate SG1 and Atlantis are rather episodic, there are an overarching plot but for most of the episodic there are one whole story per episode, not so here, this is one long story. Now I for one like this way of doing it over an episodic approach. Another thing which is very different from other Stargate series is the lack of a main alien villain race, Destiny do come into contact with some rather generic looking blue creatures after a while but they play a minor role. I for once like the many and quite well made aliens in other Stargate series so I was a bit disappointed.<br /><br />In conclusion this is a slow movies series which lack a bit of direction. It is very character driven but it lack the strong characters needed to make such a story work. The creators of the show just try to hard to force the drama, every character has a sob story but beyond that they are very generic, you have the young genius, the cute girl, the tough military leader and so on, every one of them character archetypes we have seen before and little is done to expand on those archetypes. If you like action adventure and hope to see cool spaceships and aliens and expect something similar to other Stargate series then you will be disappointed, if however a more hard and gritty science fiction story filled with drama where it is not aliens which are the main threat but the lack of food and other resources, and where characters have to deal with ship repairs, faulty computer systems and the stress of their situation is what appeal more to you then you might want to go with Stargate Universe for after the first few episodes the show becomes rather descent, though I think it have more than it share of flaws.deal with ship repairs, faulty computer systems and the stress of their situation is what appeal more to you then you might want to go with Stargate Universe for after the first few episodes the show becomes rather descent, though I think it have more than it share of flaws.

B003UESJDS|5.0|Gemma Arterton has gathered a bit of a following locally since her dark turn in [[ASIN:B0040J1RZ4 The Disappearance of Alice Creed [Blu-ray]]], and I think they will be pleased to see how fun she can be in this film.<br /><br />The story follows the graphic novel quite closely, right down to the actors looking almost identical to their drawn characters from the series. Having watched and listened to all of the special features on this BD I cannot see how any fan of the series would be disappointed in this adaption. There was quite a bit of work put into getting the story right, and the Blu preserved the scenery and indoor sets perfectly. The picture is pristine throughout, with even the infrequent split-screens looking flawless. The outdoor night sequences were colorful and without grain. The DTS was clear, with a few nice surrounds in the cattle scenes and gunshot sequence. The special features:<br /><br />* Making of TD, 13:39 minutes. An interview heavy piece with lots of film clips, mostly talking about the characters.<br />* Reconstructing TD, 10:20 minutes. A much better supplement that features Frears and Arterton comparing the original artwork panels with the resulting film.<br />* Commentary with the two leads, full length with subtitles available. This was actually a fun and worthy commentary. They both gave great tidbits of trivia about filming and kept the whole thing enjoyable. If you sit on the fence about ever listening to these sometimes tedious supplements, give this one a chance to hear how interesting the commentary can be; Finally an actor being honest about not wanting his mom in the audience for a hot scene (42:00 minute mark).<br /><br />I felt the ending was a little rushed but it could only go in one direction anyway. The 2.40 ratio was perfect for this film's landscapes and outdoor beauty. English and French 5.1 with subs in same and Spanish. Region coded A. A worthy owner and definitely a renter for an adequate non-action BD demo.
1416550550|4.0|The Forgotten Garden is one of those glorious books that is easy to get lost within the pages. While the language is not overdone (just coming off Hawthorne, it initially seemed a bit simple, in fact), Morton does a good job of describing the setting and the fascinating, odd and frightening characters within it.<br /><br />It's long but it's one of those stories that I really couldn't put down once I'd started reading it. The story takes center stage in this novel. Morton has no social agendas or deep themes. She is simply telling a fascinating and sometimes horrifying tale. Using various characters' viewpoints and skipping back and forth to and from the past, Morton carefully weaves the tantalizing and intriguing tale.<br /><br />In 1913, a small girl disembarks from a ship in Australia. She is alone, carrying a small suitcase and has forgotten her name. The dock master takes her home to his wife. They name her Nell and raise her as their own. On her twenty first birthday, her father tells her the truth of her origins and she embarks on a quest to solve the mystery of her forgotten past. Even though she gets close, the full truth will remain hidden in spite of Nell's efforts. Eventually her granddaughter Cassandra will take up the search when she discovers that upon her grandmother's death she has inherited a cottage on the sea cliffs of England. With the cottage she also discovers a walled garden, a secret garden. A forgotten garden.<br /><br />The garden and a few aspects of this novel reminded me of The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett and I had to laugh when later in the book, Morton works in a scene with the famous novelist and implies that the inspiration for Burnett's work came from this forgotten garden on the Cornish Coast. Clever indeed.<br /><br />I highly recommend it as a fabulously pleasurable read. Enjoy!

B000FBJHT4|4.0|This is one of the better books about the Roswell incident that I have read.  It would be hard to just make all this up, although the military has gone to great lengths in the past to do just that.<br /><br />Although Corso does not explain why he suddenly wanted to disclose all this information, he does give insider insight into what the army had and what they wanted to do with it.  It makes a lot of sense when it comes to the rapid technological advancements we made in the 20 years following the crash.<br /><br />He also shares his mindset, which explains why they considered the ETs hostile and thought time was of the essence to reverse engineer the recovered technology into weapons to fight the aliens.<br /><br />Unfortunately, in the Epilogue, he still feels their intentions are hostile and thinks we can now take on these aliens and beat them with our new weapons.  Hmmm... I'm not going there.

0307272702|5.0|I first encountered Taubes' work in his piece in the journal Science in 2001, and was impressed with his thoroughness.  His two recent books, \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories\\" and \\"Why We Get Fat\\" are even more thoroughly researched and make the point very convincingly that we don't get fat from eating fat, any more than we can get brave by eating a lion's heart.  Instead, we get fat from eating carbohydrate, because the body is not very good at regulating sugars and carbohydrate.  Perhaps this connection should be clear, as Taubes points out, by the connection between obesity and type 2 diabetes (aka insulin resistance), those two conditions being highly correlated and the latter greatly exacerbated by excess carbohydrate consumption.  That doesn't exactly prove that obesity is caused by excess carbs, but it does suggest it.  Recently Taubes has published a couple articles in Science further exploring the \\"epidemics\\" of obesity and type 2 diabetes, and relating them to carb consumption.  As  person on the \\"pre-diabetic\\" edge, I look forward to his further investigations and publications on this topic.
B0007DFJ0G|1.0|Saw this last night.....Could have possibly thought it was \\"ok\\" but not necessarily my cup of tea until the very last  5 minutes of the film. HORRIBLE. JUST HORRIBLE.     First movie that I can honestly say I wish there were a no star option here.
B002SQFZ68|5.0|This concert is the best. They play many classics and some new songs (for me new songs are from the 2000's to present) The production is very good. I like the way they capture the concert because you can see the stage as a whole.  The sound is fair. I think that they could have work this part better. I recommend this blu ray to any fan of Bon Jovi. You are not going to regret it.

B002ZG98Z0|5.0|This 2nd movie definitely had more depth to the characters than the previous movie did, it's just not all spelled out for the viewer. ( did love the 1st movies as well) So the viewer if not an insightful person could totally miss the points the movie was trying to make and instead mistaken it for a boring shallow movie about only fashion and complaints. But each character goes through a major transformation and realizes more about themselves which allows them to grow and become a better person. It does help to know the characters from the tv show, but it's a great movie either way. Spoiler Alert Below:       Charlotte realized she didn't have to be the perfect mom, just love her kids. Samantha realized she could be attracted to an older man and that was ok. Miranda learned to let go of her go getter self realized it's ok to not always have to fight for things and also learned how to balance her life. Then you have Carrie, who did learn how to be at peace and not always have to rush around and mess up her relationships. It's ok to be settled and accept the security given to her. I loved it!
0743244257|4.0|Wasn't sure about this book when I first got it as it's not what I would consider an \\"easy\\" read.  Here's what worked for me...first, skim the book just to get an idea of the rhythm and flow of the language and scenes.  Then go back for a REAL read.  Somewhere in there, I would suggest reading some synopses and reviews and listening to a series of radio interviews with the author, Don DeLillo, that can be found on YouTube.  Made the story much more understandable and enjoyable for me and for others I know who have now read the book.  I'm actually now reading the book for a third time...just to make sure I didn't miss anything and to make discussing it with others more enlightening.  Give it a try...It's worth it!
B001CZVVVY|2.0|I bought this disc shortly after the purchase of my first Blu-ray player and, as a great Mozart lover, and particularly a lover of this very opera I looked forward to experience lot of high qualities, both in artists' performance and recording technology. Alas, after just first play of this disc I had known already, that only the latter one had basically fulfilled my expectations.    Although some kind of modern scenography - placing the action of the opera in far later times than the original scenery had been conceived by Da Ponte and Woferl, did not disturb me watching the performance, but I found the musical interpretation rather annoying. The one to blame is the director - Mr. Harnoncourt himself, I believe. I have to point strongly, that this is pure my personal opinion and many of the owners of this disc may disagree with me. I also do not try to diminish the fame of the said director, who is obviously better expert in music than myself, but in this particular case his way of performing this opera has nothing to do with its classical spirit and character. What I mean exactly, are specifically the tempos chosen for numerous arias. Even the fabulous Anna Netrebko was not able to change my general opinion.    But, if you don't worry about loosing some money spent of this BD, just try and find out for yourself.    I don't recommend it though.
B0034G4P7G|4.0|Being a Facebook junkie for well over a year now, I was anxious to see the movie even though I pretty much knew Mark Zuckerberg's story from other news interviews and such. It definitely helps to know a bit of that too as you dive into this movie because right from the start your thrown into the night that Mark created facemash.com which was the precipice to the launch of the now billion dollar social network.<br /><br />Jesse Eisenberg does an amazing job as a quick tongued Harvard geek not yet exuding the confidence that we see in Mark in interviews today. I laughed out loud seeing Mark blogging on LiveJournal in the beginning of the movie.  I had an LJ account to back then but left it for WordPress because unlike many, I'm still a blogger these days.  I microblog on Twitter and Facebook too if that's what you call it.<br /><br />As the story goes, Mark is approached by the over confident and rich Winklevoss twins who want to launch a social network for Harvard students.  Mark teams up with them and agrees to be their coder, but somewhere along the way he runs with the idea and makes it better.  Yeah, maybe he did steal the premise and made it better.  Good lawyers helped the Winklevoss get a 65 million dollar settlement for Mark's intellectual theft, if that's what you want to call it.<br /><br />Mark also turned on his best friend, Eduardo Saverin, who had 30% holdings on Facebook when Mark made him CFO.  Eduardo had good intentions to launch advertising space on FB, but he lacked connections so Mark swindled him out of his holdings thanks to some legal mumbo jumbo that Eduardo signed without reading.  And at that time, Mark wasn't so keen on the idea.  People hate online ads, right?<br /><br />It took Sean Parker, creator of Napster, to convince Mark to go global and see the dollar signs. Justin Timberlake played a good money grubbing pompous druggie dripping with sex and confidence, but if you have ever seen the real Sean Parker in an interview, he's nothing like that.  The real Parker admitted about the movie that he wished his life was that cool. Parker stepped in with the ad revenue connections and was given 6% holdings.  Eduardo settled out of court for a lump sum probably larger than what the Winklevoss twins got. By now, like they say in the film, that was just a traffic ticket to Zuckerberg.<br /><br />The characters, the storylines, and the hefty settlements are all true - the entire basis for the story and where Mark was when.  By now you probably know its the conversations and turn of events that are fictional.  Heck, haven't we all seen movies \\"based on a true story\\" that weren't even close.  Who cares?  It's the gritty fast paced edge to the film that keeps it interesting.  Face it, do we really care how a twenty-something year old Harvard geek became the world's youngest billionaire?  It's a newsworthy story, yes, and most of us, almost all of us, are hooked on his social networking drug.<br /><br />As the movie bounces in and out of legal meetings, we get lots of sarcastic one liners from Mark.  The twins fight back with the chips on their shoulders.  Eduardo hangs his head in shame at the loss of a friend.  The movie definitely deserves the Oscar attention its getting.  It's different.  It's fresh.  And if you are on Facebook, then make it some required viewing.  It's worth the time away from the computer.ted about the movie that he wished his life was that cool.

B001NLKWLW|1.0|I was encouraged to read this book by a book group.  I can't image why any mature reader would choose this book: it is full of deus ex machina, overworked prose (in an effort to be lyrical?), incredible machinations of the plot.  The book is a fairy tale for adults who don't want to know anything about life, character (black and white here) or the inexplicable.    To add insult to injury, the writing is abysmal: full of fragments that forced me to re-read the phrases purporting to be sentences--to try to figure out what was being said, if anything.  This author needs a few lessons in grammar, which is how civilized people communicate: by the conventions of the language.         I think this is the first time in my life that I have given such a low rating to a book.
B0045I3EJC|2.0|Short Attention Span Summary:<br /><br />1. We started out with a guy who was 118 years old in some futuristic universe.<br />2. As it goes on, we see when he was younger through flashbacks.<br />3. From his childhood, we follow him through three possible lives that he could have lived.<br />4. At some point while going through his possible lives, the movie falls apart and I honestly can't tell what happened.<br /><br />First thing: This movie was over 2 hours long. More time= more places to go wrong/ lose the viewer with a very complicated topic.<br /><br />Second thing: The topics were just a bit too involved. Looking on Wikipedia, it says that \\"The plot also makes deep use of various scientific elements, such as the Big Bang theory, the Superstring theory, the Many-worlds interpretation and the concepts of telomeres and parallel universes.\\" Yes, nice, all well and good. But if you want topics that deep, then pick ONE or TWO, and develop the ideas. (But they didn't!)<br /><br />Finally: This movie started out with great potential, but then just got over the top and a bit too hard to follow. (People who are physicists sometimes don't understand that *not everyone*  is a physicist and *not everyone* is on the same plane of reality as they are.)<br /><br />A version of this that was done before (much better) was: \\"The Butterfly Effect.\\" They dealt with one simple topic: Chaos Theory. It was well done and easy enough for layman to follow (unlike this film).<br /><br />This film is worth about a rental or a matinee price.
B000008HZB|5.0|Any chance I get to praise Jeff Lynne I take. This collection of pure Lynne magic is always at the ready in my music selection. Here he offers renditions of two classics \\"September Song\\", \\"Stormy Weather\\" to a remake of \\"Don't Let Go\\" an unknown (at least to myself but a great song)to his always catchy and infectiously toe tapping, steering wheel slapping pop gems. As always he tries new (at the time) production devices and methods and of course the ever faithful old school tricks. He's also incorporated the influences of newfound musical friends and some of the usual suspects. This selection along with 2001's \\"Zoom\\" share space on my mp3 player and on a well worn burned cd. Of all the music in my ELO collection to choose from it's these two choices that I listen to at least once a week. I can't ever say enough about my enthusiasm of Jeff Lynnes music. And as always I'm a very satisfied Amazon customer!!

031603438X|5.0|[ Please note, I bought the HardBack and the audio Book from Amazon, but amazon does not allow me to review the audio book separately , see the audio book comments down the bottom]<br /><br />Ultimately Keith Rich Richards and James Fox have produced a book that is eminently read-able. The book contains plenty of material for all the fans, even giving some pointers on his five string guitar style and also how he came across this style. Covering the start after he covers what I might term a \\"high low\\" point, or should that be a significant low point in that the tour Keith deemed to be a low in terms of combative issues in the tours over time.<br />  Keith covers his early days very well, and whilst he says he remembers it all, or \\"I haven't forgotten any of it\\", it is clear he has done some research to clarify things, and on the way he discovers plenty of cool things.<br />  As you read the book, as much as Keith \\"uses\\" people, he does get used by people, and he seems to be very conscious of this, and for the people he knows, this seems to be more of a friendship element, so I don't agree that Keith is a constant user of other people, since he comes across as a human who has give and take in his life, as well as being a great friend, as well as a ferocious enemy ( not that he wants to be combative, in my view); in the world of what he has done, I think he has been exceedingly focused. If what he says is correct in the Caribbean connections, it seems obvious that Keith has developed some great friends, and I don't think you get that way by being an unpleasant person.<br /> The most poignant elements in Keiths life are mixed together with the best; even the narative associated with Mick, and the story behind Bill Wyman leaving is very revealing. Keith reveals a lot about himself and I think he comes out in a very positive light.<br /> All in all, it is Keith's Point of View about events, and he comes across in a far deeper way than the tabloids and Music mags could ever do. This is an excellent read, and would make a superb movie ( like some of the other Rock Bios that have come out recently).As they say, often, truth is stranger than fiction.<br /><br />AUDIO BOOK:<br /><br />Obviously some things I don't need to repeat, however I am teed off that the audio book cannot be reviewed separately:<br /><br />Great Book, Great Performance<br /><br />One of the benefits of producing a very good written book is that the stage is set for a superb performance piece,<br />and if one of your friends just happens to be Johnny Depp, well, you have someone who can copy you better than you<br />can copy yourself. This is especially the case with the way Depp has copied keith Richards in such a manner that<br />the laconic elder Statesman of rock, has a possibly good version of him by Depp. The over the top Pirates version<br />of Sparrow with the Richards persona overwritten is well known, but its clear that with a larger than life book,<br />you get a larger than life script performance. I have heard Keith in long interviews give an effortlessly droll<br />riposte to the seasoned interviewer, and its all in a days work for Rocks master of Menace, his Satanic Majesty.<br />Whether or not the books content is a true series of events, its an amazing trip that takes you along for the ride,<br />and in an audio version this is just magnificent. Getting to spend quality time with Depp, Keith, and a passable<br />reader who does the intermediate phases, is a total trip. No matter how well you know the book, the added dimension<br />in the audio book is an awesome performance piece that passes the test, and delivers a more than inciteful comment<br />on the UK and USA, and the insanity that the rock world created around and within itself. A not to be missed audio<br />book.

B0038M2AZA|5.0|This definitely is a five-star film.  I've never seen any other movie on Amazon that has only five- and four-star reviews, but this one is a treasure that shouldn't be missed if you like heartfelt, compassionate, educational, and fascinating examinations of the lives of people who have made a true difference in the world while overcoming obstacles that most of us can't even imagine.  This movie transcends entertainment, and becomes an experience that will give you a new perspective on what life and living are all about.  My thanks to the people who made this film!
1594202842|5.0|I think this book is absolutely brilliant. I read and finished it in 2 days flat.  I think there are a lot of mis-conceptions about the message of the book.      For one thing, Amy Chua is NOT saying that chinese parents are superior. When she uses the term 'chinese parenting' she is alluding to a particularly strict style and methodology of parental training and instruction, which, she admits, is in no way limited to those of chinese origin, but can be adopted by any parent who employs a similar approach; including those who are Indian, African, Jamaican etc., and surely also any American who chooses to place great emphasis on high success and achievement in academic work and personal accountability in their children.    Neither does the author espouse her parental approach as the best way of doing things. She openly catalogs her failure to force her 2nd daughter to behave exactly as she wishes and admits to having driven her too hard. She catalogs her awful mother moments without reserve, something I think is quite brave: you'll never find out my worst mother moments.    I like anything that helps me to look at things from a new perspective. Whilst I think the author went too far in her strict disiplined approach, I believe that I and many others have gone too far in the 'child-centred' approach. I have oftened praised my children just for attempting their homework etc. Now I am questioning this thought process.  This book has caused me to reassess what my children are capable of.  At some point it has become increasingly un-PC to criticise children for failure, or to criticise them full stop. I don't believe we are doing them any favours with this.      One of the best passages in the book is when the author describes her view of where TRUE confidence comes from. She believes that TRUE confidence cannot just be externally given(through repeated praise etc) instead it comes from working hard and persevering at something until you not only pass it, but MASTER it. This is exemplefied in the most controversial part of the book where she forces her daughter to practise the piano for hours without a break until she masters a musical piece. She did go too far here; however the point was that her daughter truly believed she was INCAPABLE of playing the piece.  So her confidence grew mountains when she not only made a breakthrough and played it correctly, she mastered it and played it with ease and came to love it.  She learned through experience as opposed to the 'mantra method' of you can do/be anything you want to be with perseverance and hard effort.    Really, I think the people who are getting het-up about this book are feeling defensive, rather than looking for the merits within it. Why that is I don't know. We have problems in the west and there are problems in the east. Somewhere in between there lies a balance.  People should read this book and think what could be achieved with an educational/parental approach that merges both.  I have a lot of respect for Amy Chua.

B000R8YC18|5.0|I didn't think the music soundtrack has held up as well as the rest of the film. It's Gothic in sound, almost like a B-movie from the 50s. But that's what Scorcese grew up on, so maybe he meant it to be that way. DeNiro is classic here, as is Jodi Foster at age 12. I had forgotten about the Cybil Sheppard side plot. Harvey Keitel is a howl as the coke addict pimp. Nice hair. The film looks great in its current incarnation. It's a piece of art. See it.

B003L20IFQ|5.0|This movie takes place in a coffin. Know that up front. However, it is absolutely necessary and completely effective. Never before have I had a reaction to a film the way I did to Buried. You are completely and utterly buried along with Reynolds which is what makes the ending so effective. Anything that happens to our protagonist is essentially happening to you. The ending had me gasping for air, uncontrollably shaking and wanting to press play immediately after it was over.

0307454541|1.0|Where do I start? How humorous and what a joke this book is? How one dimensional the characters are? How you don't want to root for them, but rather punch them in the face? And the mystery? HA! what mystery? This book relies more on shocking the reader, rather them giving them a good storyline to follow.<br /><br />OK, so the storyline wasn't up to my standards. At least the writing isn't too bad? WRONG. Just to give you an example, the main character eats sandwiches. Sandwiches with sausages. Sandwiches with cucumbers. Man, if only the author could have introduced a hamburger to the character then life surely would have been grander.<br /><br />In a nutshell, if you want to read a book that doesn't develop characters and gives you ridiculous plots without much reasoning, well my friend, this is the book for you.

1439163146|4.0|I read the reviews for Franco's book before I actually read the short stories themselves. The reviews were so mixed that I decided to read the book myself. At first, the number of characters, entering the work so quickly, confused me; however, as I kept reading, each became clear and interesting. In the middle of the work, Franco wrote some \\"snip-its,\\" which appeared to me to be clever examples of brief stream of consciousness narratives. Throughout the work, the author rarely \\"finishes\\" a story. As in life, he succeeds in mirroring the ambiguity of relationships. He also creatively presents the \\"anomie\\" of adolescence and the corresponding attempts made to counter the feelings of emptiness and void. He does this chiefly through the venues of meaningless sex and drugs/alcohol. Franco also raises other important psychosocial issues, the most profound of which may well be the issue of identity. Self-statements of stupidity and worthlessness, reflective self-statements of homoerotic projections and displacement, and the question of whether or not it makes any difference if a boy is a girl or gay - which is better or worse? - show a sensitivity to gender identification and orientation likely to upset some readers. Finally, happy people do not tend to self-destruct; many of the adolescents in this book are self-destructive, which poignantly underlines the labile moods, insecurity, sexual identity questions, and acting-out behaviors of many of Franco's characters. They straddle the void, struggling to find some meaning in their lives and attempts to blunt the loneliness that plagues them. Franco should definitely continue to write.
B0021L8V0M|4.0|I knew this movie was Angelina Jolie doing the James Bond thing...sort of.<br />When I popped the DVD in it gave me three options.<br />\\"Theatrical Version\\"<br />\\"Director's Cut\\"<br />And the version I ended up watching \\"Extended Cut\\".<br /><br />Jolie turns in a great performance along with the rest of the cast.<br />Solid direction.<br />A decent score.<br />Pacing was spot on.<br />The only thing I found a little disappointing as I do with all films like this is how unrealistic it is.<br />Jolie and crew simply walk away from accidents and falls that would kill anyone without so much as a scratch and not a hair out of place.<br /><br />That minor gripe aside, the film is a blast.<br />Great popcorn movie that doesn't require a lot of thought.<br />I give it my recommendation.
B002ZG98J6|1.0|Unfortunately the poor execution of 20th Century Fox has wasted my time.  This is the 3rd Fox title that I have had to return for a replacement on BD-ROM.  Me and the wife enjoyed the movie (luckily the DVD worked) but it's like they say \\"Once you go Black you never go back.\\"  Once you go Blu you never go back.  Luckily Amazon has an excellent return policy for defective products, but I just got my player 2 months ago and have purchased 100+ titles replacing classics old and new that I had on DVD to Blu.  Hopefully I won't have to go through much more of this crap.  The Fox library of films includes some excellent titles that I can't wait to be released on BD, I hope they get their disc publisher sorted soon.  I can't be the only one with these problems.
1843794411|4.0|I wouldn't have thought having a male reader for a Georgette Heyer novel would work...until I heard Richard Armitage. In this high comedy (about being married, not getting married), Horatia Winwood, the stammering youngster of three sisters, tangles with the Earl of Rule when he proposes to her oldest sister...a match that makes financial and social sense, but would break two hearts. Armitage's narration is elegant and unhurried, and he makes the various characters' voices sufficiently distinct for the listener. Be aware that this recording is abridged: I know that's an issue for some people. I wish it were all here, but I listened to the first two chapters with the original book in front of me. While a lot of description has been jettisoned, I didn't notice anything of consequence to the plot--such as it is--getting lost. It's a different medium, and as such I found the result most enjoyable.
1599218011|5.0|I love this book. The author Kris Carr has such a fun writing style. She really draws you in and makes learning about nutrition interesting and entertaining while also informing. The book also offers recipes, cleanses, inspiration and affirmations. I pick the book back up a few times a week just to get some of the good energy it gives me. Would definitely recommend to the health consious. You don't have to adopt everything but it really makes you think about everything that you are putting into your body!

Unfortunately my DVR would only record 2 shows at once. Now I get to receive my weekly dose Fringe! I agree this is an excellent series and I'm surprised it hasn't received a greater following. This may be because it was completing with other AAA shows on Thursday. Maybe now it will get the recognition it deserves!
B004DK5CW4|3.0|You try hard to judge something on its own merit. It's just that the specter of the SEABISCUIT film is crapdoodling all over this one. I liked SECRETARIAT, but there were bits in it that were sorta wonky. Indisputably, it's a story that needed to be told, concerning a legendary Triple Crown champion that ranks as one of history's most fabulous racehorses, and perhaps the most fabulous racehorse, at that. Diane Lane is fine, although there were moments in which she comes off a bit too strident, over-the-top. Lane plays Penny Chenery Tweedy, a Denver housewife who decides to run her parents' horse-breeding operation. Her brother just wants to sell the family business to remain solvent. But Penny, willful and bold, strives on, hanging her sack of hopes and dreams on the promising young foal Big Red, son of Bold Ruler. Because the race track commission states that the name \\"Big Red\\" is much too common a name for a horse, Penny changes it to Secretariat.<br /><br />Penny's long commutes between Denver and Virginia exact a toll in the Tweedy household, her husband feeling neglected, not at all supportive of her daring ventures in the sport of kings. It's a fine line between foolhardy and inspired, and mostly it hinges on whether you pull off your crazy schemes or not. It helps that Penny has the thoroughbred to back up her gamble. In the 1970s Secretariat captured the horse racing public's imagination, and the press's imagination. The film focuses on Secretariat's historic run at the Triple Crown, a feat that, at that time, had not been accomplished in a quarter of a century. The question leading into the arduous Belmont Stakes was whether Secretariat had the endurance to go with the vaunted speed. But of course, on that day, Secretariat blew away the competition by 31 lengths. When Secretariat died, his heart was discovered to be twice as big as any other horse's heart. No one was surprised.<br /><br />SECRETARIAT is quite watchable and predictable and there were things that nagged. Lane's few inspirational speeches feel contrived, overdramatic. People were amazed by Lane's performance here, and I agree that she did very well. But I wonder how much of the fave reaction is in seeing an actress not known for taking a role which calls for her to be fierce. I wasn't that impressed with Sandra Bullock in THE BLIND SIDE, either. I expect any screenplay to be manipulative, and it's cool as long as it avoids the pitfalls of being too familiar or lazy or over-the-top or anything else that rips you out of the story. That scene with Penny's trainer's assistant or horse walker yelling at an empty Kentucky race track that it hasn't seen nothin' yet is utter cheese, man. That whole tired thread about Penny's disintegrating marriage was a downer. There's too much anthropomorphizing of Secretariat, and I think it cost the film some of its grounding. I was cringing a little during the scene in which an injured Secretariat and Penny were soulfully gazing into each other's eyes, Penny trying to determine if her horse can carry on, and Secretariat... I don't know that he was thinking anything... because he's a friggin' horse.<br /><br />John Malkovich co-stars as Secretariat's colorful, French-spewing trainer Lucien Laurin. But even his brand of quirk doesn't alter the fact that he's strictly a supporting character, the movie clearly about the horse and his owner. There's a half-finished feel to the rest of the cast.<br /><br />I have to bring up SEABISCUIT, a film that was more in context, more immersive, more grounded, and had more breadth, had more heart. Secretariat plied his trade in the early '70s, during the Vietnam War and during the hippie age, and this backdrop, to me, doesn't resonate as deeply as the Great Depression. To me, the Biscuit was an even more compelling underdog, and there's a deeper emotional pull in watching the Depression-era public identify with the short, ungainly, lopsided Seabiscuit.<br /><br />But, don't get me wrong, Icheered like mad during Secretariat's epic and very surreal assault at the Belmont record. That sequence is almost as entertaining as the printed press war over this film between film critic Roger Ebert and Salon reviewer Andrew O'Hehir.<br /><br />I think I'll go for the trifecta and go watch PHAR LAP.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus material: \\"Heart of A Champion\\"- a featurette about Secretariat, mostly focusing on his taking of the Triple Crown and including an interview with the real life Penny Chenery  (00:14:56 minutes long); 3 Deleted Scenes with Director's introduction (totaling 00:03:41 minutes); and A.J. Michalka's music video \\"It's Who You Are.\\"cheered like mad during Secretariat's epic and very surreal assault at the Belmont record.

0674032810|5.0|This is the best edition available (as far as I am aware) of one of the most important books ever written, in which Darwin provided the answer to what had been called the \\"mystery of mysteries\\", the origin of species.    Darwin shows that \\"species are not immutable\\"; that all living creatures are linked by common descent; and that natural selection is the mechanism by which evolutionary change takes place.    This edition really does provide the best of both worlds. It gives us a facsimile of the first edition of \\"On the Origin of Species\\" side by side with up-to-date explanations and comments by James T. Costa.    You do not have to be a scientific specialist to read the \\"Origin\\", but I do feel that you can get more out of it if you have first read a modern introduction to evolution such as Ernst Mayr's \\"What Evolution Is\\" or Jerry Coyne's \\"Why Evolution Is True\\". This, along with Costa's annotations, allows you to appreciate what Darwin got right and what he got wrong, as well as the historical context of the times.    There were things that Darwin could not know 150 years ago: he knew nothing of modern genetics or the causes of variation; he mistakenly thought that the Lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics played a part in evolution; and later theorists such as Ernst Mayr have added to our understanding of how one species branches off from another in the speciation process. This is where the prior reading I have suggested and Costa's annotations are particularly useful.    I must admit that there are sections (those on variation and hybridism, for example) that I found myself skimming. But, on the other hand, chapters such as those on the \\"Struggle for Existence\\" and \\"Natural Selection\\" drew me into reading every word.    Stephen Jay Gould summed up Darwin by saying that he was conservative in his personal life, liberal in his political views (in his strong opposition to slavery for example), and radical in his scientific ideas. I'll end with Darwin's own succinct summary, from his Introduction, of the most important of these radical scientific ideas, his theory of natural selection:    \\"As many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a better chance of surviving, and thus be naturally selected. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.\\"    Phil Webster.  (England)
B00288KNJU|4.0|I had no earthly idea what I was in for when I popped \\"Coraline\\" in the Blu-Ray player. My wife, my nearly-8-year-old son and I curled up with some popcorn after dinner, and sat back to see what this was all about.  From the first eerie, muted scenes, and off-kilter score, you realize you're about to take a trip to somewhere you haven't been before, and it might not be 100% pleasant.  I must say my son was hypnotized from the first scene. He even put down his Nintendo DS. I don't think he blinked more than twice during the whole running time.  The tale, about Coraline, her odd family and MORE odd \\"other\\" family, is a fractured fairy tale to be sure. There's a classicism to the story...it has a little Hansel and Gretel to it...but it's also defiantly modern in the heroine's sensibilities.  The plot has been outlined to death by other reviewers.   While the movie unspooled, my wife kept looking over to me, the look on her face of \\"this is kinda creepy\\" was unmistakable.  I asked my son a few times, \\"Are you OK? Are you scared?\\", and each time he replied \\"Yes\\" with a smile.  The animation is living, breathing,  moving art. Dear God you could stare into that (2D for me) picture and find infinite, amazing details within each room, each exterior...the garden...there's one shot that will literally take your breath away. You will actually pause your respiratory effort, so that you can absorb that gorgeous overhead shot of the garden. If you've seen the movie, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. If you haven't, well, if you remember anything about this review, you'll remember THIS when you see that shot.  The voice acting is superb. The expressive puppetry is nothing short of miraculous. The music is intertwined with the images brilliantly.  I enjoyed this about as much as my son, and more than my wife, who was still pretty creeped out at the end.  The making-of stuff is thorough, but not overwhelming.  At less than sixteen bucks, this disc is a bargain and a half.
1554072840|5.0|I read the reviews and was a little uneasy about purchasing this book based on the comments with the vocabulary and terminology used. So I read the book first and changed a few words to fit my child. Once she realized that prudence had a \\"hole\\" and thats where the caca came from. It clicked. She literally was potty trained in 3 days. I love this book. We keep it handy in the bath room. Do yourselves a favor though, these books are to teach them the concept, its the parents job to reinforce it. Dont leave your house for the weekend, encourage every dribble and drop that they make and watch their cues. I love this book.

1594202842|3.0|I found the timing of this book great since the US Educational system has recently been designated the 14th in the world with China ahead of the US.    Many of the judgemental comments shows US reading ability is low.  You're not supposed to read to judge; you're supposed to learn something; gain greater understanding.  Too many have decided for the children that they will be unhappy but only the children can judge that.    Ms. Chua points out early \\"I'm using the term 'Chineese mother' loosely.\\"  \\"I'm also using the term 'Western parents' loosely\\".  But if I were to draw a definitive destinction between the two styles it would be thus; Western parenting produces adults with jack of all trades but master of nothing vs. Chineese master of something.\\"  It is true no one wins Olympic Gold by practicing when one feels like it.    Ms Chua has laid herself bare, warts and all for all to see.  She is an extreemist.  But no one should allow her extreemism to deflect from what she does get right.  What she's saying is despite her extreemism and mistakes she'd still choose her parenting style over others.  It is in fact the Chinese way that children take care of their elders.  At present the Chinese are creating laws enforcing their children visit their elderly parents.  At present China is creating a law that children can't move back home to \\"nibble at their elders\\"  Adult children take care of their parents as their parents took care of them.  It's the circle of life.  And Western parents too overschedule their children.  The issue lies with what activities will be most profitable at the end of the day.    Western parents think so highly of their own children to the point of delusion but the truth is that no one is going to like your children and will even think worse of you if your children back talk, are rude and have no respect for authoriy or their elders.     Ms Chua shows she has assimilated a few Western values and the dogs are symbolic of it.  It's true that dogs inChina are considered a meal.  She rebelled against her parents but her strict upbringing caused her rebellion to be profitable; Berekley vs. Harvard.  The Western style of rebellion; drugs, drinking and dropping out of school is not profitable.  No, she didn't like going into science as her parents wanted her to but it did eventually lead to the ability to find what she wanted and was good at.  She admits she's not very good at smelling the roses but on the otherhand it's one of the reason's why she has the time to work and teach her children so much.  It's a trade off.  She's also admitted it doesn't work for everyone; perhaps not her youngest, Lulu.  But that story is still yet to be told because as an adult Lulu may yet find she's greatful to her mother as I have with certain strict aspects of my childhood.    As to her husband; he wouldn't have married her and agreed to her parenting style if he himself didn't feel he'd missed something in his own childhood.  Though he has a brilliant career he may in fact be an underachiever.    Western parenting style freely and often given for the simplist of tasks creates narcissists: which are on the rise in the US.  I believe that our present economic situation and declining educational system is a result of US parenting skills.  I could go on to write where Ms. Chua is right and Westerners are wrong but it would take too much time.    I gave it three (3) stars because I believe her story is relevant today and she imparts some excellant wisdom that  Western parents should take to heart.  I didn't give a 5 star rating for the following reasons.  She should have waited until she could relate the outcome of her parenting; her daughters were still too young to judge the outcome.  As a result she lacked a good ending.  But there again I respect her for admitting she didn't know how to end her memoir.    This book is best read by people with the skills to absorb truth, distinguish what is useful and refuff what is not.    Thisbook is not for you if you gain your self esteem by judging others, can't admit you do something wrong, take everything personally or refuse to learn something new.
0385341679|4.0|Back when I used to ride roller coasters, I rode practically every type out there: the ones that go backwards, upside down, and around several loops; the ones that plunge you into the water or cocoon you so that you can't see anything, and many others.  Reading Shadowfever was like all of those coasters rolled into one.  The action is non-stop.  You think you know where the story's going, then you're jerked with dizzying speed in another direction entirely.  Just when you think you've figured things out, you're plunged right back into the dark.  There are at least 2 developments that most of you will absolutely not have seen coming - and they are doozies!  Can't give you any more of a clue than that without spoiling it for you.  The ending is ambiguous (deliberately so, I think) so I don't think Moning is done with the Fae world just yet.       The book is not flawless.  There were for me some rather glaring inconsistencies; and in some parts, it seemed as though Moning was just making it up as she went along, throwing in characters just to quickly wrap up a plotline.  These flaws did not diminish my enjoyment in the least.  In fact, I'll probably re-read it because I'm sure there are details that I missed the first time around.  Hope you enjoy Shadowfever as much as I did!    Prediction: Christian and Dani will get their own stories.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Thank goodness I ignored the description of this book as a children's book!  As an avid adult reader, having just finished this literary journey, I am mesmerized.  A powerful read, to say the least.  So thankful I did not miss this one!

0671004107|5.0|I saw the movie about a year ago, and I must say that this novel FAR surpassed my expectations. I expected it to be dry and a challenging read, and although there were some places that were dry and difficult to get through, the book as a whole was engaging and intriguing. Some of the science was over my head (physics? red shift?), but for the most part, Sagan breaks down the science into simple language that most people should be able to understand. Mostly, however, this book is an examination of the relationships between science, religion, and politics. Throughout the entire book, for example, Ellie runs into obstacles just being a female scientist. Then, when she stumbles upon the radio signal from Vega, she is chastised for not keeping it secret from other nations and asking other scientists, who are also unencumbered by political pettiness, for assistance. Thus, we have to wonder -- if we DID discover communication from another planet, would we ever manage to work together to answer the call, or would we still try to one-up other nations? Even more prominent -- and controversial -- is the discourse between faith and science. As someone who has long ago reconciled science and religion, this book is extraordinarily refreshing. Science and faith are not mutually exclusive, and everyone -- even people who fancy themselves \\"atheists\\" -- has faith in something. This book calls for theists not to cover their ears and shout \\"LA LA LA\\" in the face of scientific discovery, and for atheists not to shut themselves off from anything they may not be able to prove firsthand. Loved this book from start to finish, and will definitely read it again in the future.

B003L20ICE|3.0|This is an oft told story about a marriage in which  one of the the partners does not feel validated, valued or heard and what happens when someone who does validate, value and hear comes on the scene.  The acting was good, particularly on the part of  Annette Bening but the movie was disappointingly slow and predictable.  I agree with other reviewers that the rave reviews are a bit surprising.  Most likely it is the contemporary gender twist that moves this into the arena of being edgy.  Not a bad movie but one that was disappointing.
B00275EGWY|5.0|Watching The Hurt Locker and The Kingdom in succession provides an interesting perspective on the politics of East meets West and the American men and women we send there to make a difference.<br /><br />Sergeant First Class William James (Jeremy Renner) is new team leader in Bravo company of a U.S. Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) unit in 2004 Iraq.  He is a replacement for Staff Sergeant Thompson (Guy Pearce), who died from an IED in Baghdad. The other two member sof the team are James' guards who act as lookouts to prevent a follow-up ambush during bomb disposal, Sergeant J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty). This is the story of an elite specialist, not a grunt who took on military service because he was looking to prove himself.  The Hurt Locker asks: what kind of person becomes an expert at the most dangerous job in the world?<br /><br />Sanborn and Eldridge count the days before their time is up - when they return home to their families, or when a sniper's bullet finally kills them.  Eldridge is nervous, jumpy, and on a slippery slope.  Sanborn is the consummate professional who goes by the book, but in a war torn land where few rules apply, James' flagrant disregard for safety rattles him.  Both men are convinced that James will be the death of them.<br /><br />And they're right.  James is good at what he does because he defines his universe from within.  James decides to befriend a young boy he nicknames Beckham (Christopher Sayegh) because he reminds James of his son. When James discovers a child victim of terror, James decides - with no evidence whatsoever - that it's Beckham.  It doesn't matter if the child is actually alive or dead.  James' boundaries are constructed in his own mind, because the forces he work with are entirely unpredictable.  Calmly detached from his own reality, James decides the bombs won't go off because they haven't yet, that he will live because he's survived so far. In a fickle, cruel world, James' self-centeredness borders on sociopathy, but it's exactly the kind of mindset he needs to be so good at facing down death every day.<br /><br />The problem is that supreme selfishness is not a trait that the military values.  What makes James an excellent bomb disposal expert makes him a terrible soldier in the field, and he nearly gets his team members killed in a misguided mission of revenge.<br /><br />The Hurt Locker culminates in a standoff over a Iraqi civilian with a bomb strapped to his chest. The experience convinces Sanborn to return home and settle down, but it never penetrates the inward-looking sphere that is James' ego.<br /><br />What makes the Hurt Locker so good is how it tells a story inward-out instead of outward-in. This is James' story first and foremost; everyone else, from his teammates to civilians to his own family, are just characters in his orbit.  And yet all those characters feel real. The Hurt Locker may be James' story, but it tells the plight of soldiers everywhere through sand, tears, sweat, and blood.eredness borders on sociopathy, but it's exactly the kind of mindset he needs to be so good at facing down death every day.

B004I2K4DY|5.0|Les Mis&eacute;rables has been around for a long time, pleasing audiences around the world - its songs are recorded by an vast array of singers and its impact on audiences is justifiably powerful.  Though this filming of the concert production of the musical as performed at London's O2 Arena in January 2010 is hailed as the 25th anniversary of the musical, it is too frequently forgotten that the show, based on the Victor Hugo novel,  was originally written by  Claude-Michel Sch&ouml;nberg and Alain Boubil with  Jean-Marc Natel and produced in Paris, France in 1980 (it closed after 3 months).  This English Adaptation is by Trevor Nunn and John Caird (with additional material by James Fenton) was brought to England and the world through the efforts of Cameron MacKintosh in 1985.<br /><br />The concert version is performed with orchestra and chorus in the top of the platforms in O2 Arena and the characters in the musical are in costume standing before microphones at the edge of the performing structure. The light crew performs spectacular effects with the enormous facilities at this 23,000 seat arena. Some action is projected on screens above the performers (the lifting of the cart by Valjean, the barricade, etc) and at other times the screens offer the audience huge close-up view of the performers. It works well under the direction of Nick Morris. The celebration of the birthday of the show is accompanied by prolonged appearances by past members of casts of the show, a light show, and much confetti and self congratulation speeches.<br /><br />As for the production itself it is populate by a generally strong cast.  Alfie Boe, a 37 year old British tenor who studied opera but now sings the big demanding musicals, is a very fine Jean Valjean. Norm Lewis, and American actor/baritone is one of the strongest Jauverts on record: he is a talent to watch. Lea Salonga brings years of experience to her interpretation of Fantine, Samantha Banks is a very strong Eponine, the Iranian-born Canadian musical theater singing actor Ramin Karimloo makes a striking impression in the role of Enjolras (he has been playing the role of Phantom in the 'Phantom of the Opera' in England for years), but the performance of Katie Hall as Cosette sounds strained, the Monsieur Th&eacute;nardier of Matt Lucas is completely unfocused (Jenny Galloway fares better as Madame Th&eacute;nardier), and it is obvious the producers elected to play to the young audience by miscasting pop star Nick Jonas as Marius: he tries very hard but is out of his league here.<br /><br />In all, this is an entertaining memento of a birthday celebration - heavy on audience screaming and special party effects - and rewards the creators of this lasting fine musical with due respect.

B001RCD2DW|4.0|Really good sound.  Gives you a big sound stage and I am enjoying it.  Other reviews are saying the bass is low, but I think its fine.  Have not \\"burned them in\\" yet but I am going to use them regularly without, this is because I don't really believe in that stuff.  Sure the sound should change with continued use because of flex, etc, but I don't think its necessary.   Can hear a lot of details and at higher levels there isn't distortion.  I haven't cranked them at max, though on occasion, from switch to speakers to headphone I did not adjust the volume and got a whiff of the blast.  I listen to blues, pop, rap, electronica and they all sound damn good.  If you want more thump just pump up the EQ for more bass if thats is your sort of thing.      Construction is solid by AKG although its made primarily of plastics. This is not really a con as most headphones are constructed this way to save money.  My previous headphones were the HDJ-2000 which was constructed  with metal hinges and felt more sturdy.  I am going to continue to use the HDJ-2000 as portables.  Made in Austria, if that means anything to you.  I watched a video of them making the headphones and its pretty cool, nice craftsmanship.  The design is well done.  Self adjusting to fit your head, flex near the hinge to bend and conform to your head.  Removable cable so if you damage the wire you won't be screwed.  The wire is also very long so you can move about and not feel like a dog on a short leash.    Speaking of moving around...(I suck at transitions)  These headphones are not portable.  You could use them with a portable mp3 player but you will need to crank it max and then it will still not sound that great.  This is because of the high impedance.  Maybe if you had a portable amp. The other problem is it is an open headphone, so riding the bus and listening to Justin Bieber will get you weird looks.  Not that I listen to JB or wear this on the go; if you take the headphones off you will be able to hearthe sound playing at a decent level.  Pretty sure this headphones were designed for studio or home use by the included fat input jack screwed over the standard 3.5mm mp3 jack.    The HDJ-2000 was more comfortable because of the plush headbands and pads.  The headband for the akg 702 as most noted is very uncomfortable.  Those nub on the band dig into your skull and they start hurting after 10 minutes or more of use.  I did a mod to the headphones using bubble wrap and some electrical tap.  This was done to add some cushioning to the middle area of the band where most of the force to support the band is at and also where the top of your head rests with the band.  If you have a rounder head then myself, this modification will probably be not required. (I guess I am a pinhead :D)  I think if they removed the nubs the headphones might be more comfortable, I am not sure.  The nubs do flex when you press on them but they are still too hard for comfort.  Probably a large part of this pain is the design of the headphones where they adjust automatically to the size of your head and the headphone rests at the apex of your head- the part where most reviewers are feeling the pain.  The pads are very comfortable and go over your ears while not causing irritation around the circumference of the ear.    I would recommend these headphones but you should try these out for yourself and see if comfort and sound is to your liking.  I contacted Amazon and you can try these out as long as you keep your box and etc before 30 days of use.    Short breakdown:  Pros:  -Great sound(pretty damn accurate)  -Big sound-stage  -Great detail  -Accurate have not heard distortion  -Comes with 3.5mm jack and bigger jack that goes over it.  -Looks slick though I am just wearing these at home.  Cons:  -Headband hurts.  Gives boo boos on the top of your head.  Feels like the skin is getting rubbed and pressed.(Can be fixed with mods to headband to add comfort)  -Cost: Cost is high, but cheaper at Amazonwith fast shipping.  The cost seems justified because of great design and sound quality.  These are the higher end AKG headphones and are still made in Australia.  -Not portable at all.  It is not the size of the headphones that make them not portable, it is the impedance.  You will need an amp because they don't sound that great even if you turn the nub to max.  -Questionably construction strength,  I accidentally sat on it and I felt the band flex.  I examined it and nothing was damaged but it was the plastic construction that had me worried.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Are we seriously reviewing a product that has yet to be released?  How do you review a version of a movie you haven't seen?  The thing that still gets people up in arms is the fact that Lucas changed a few things, and now it looks and feels differently from the original release.  What I want to know, is how many people have seen every single edit George Lucas has made?  I'm sorry your childhood has been tainted, but you must realize the versions you had seen in the theater in the 70's and 80's were edited from the original film.  A director chooses which scenes to keep, which scenes to re-shoot or digitally alter, and what music, sound effects, and visual effects to go where and when.  I find it strange, and in some ways hilarious, that some people are so wrapped up in themselves and their own preferences, that they attempt to refuse the director the right to make his own movie his own way.  Watch what's put in front of you, or make your own film.  Either way, I think the rest of us have had enough of your mindless dribble.  Stick to your VCR, sell you computer, and return to 1977.  Watch what you want, and the rest will decide for themselves.  Save your argumentative skills for something that actually matters.  And as for the guy who said that those who don't prefer the original versions don't understand film history, I beg the question, \\"do you?\\".  Think about it.

0132350882|4.0|Clean Code is a well-written book by Robert Martin and a few colleagues, explaining their take on the best way to write computer code. The main thrust of their thesis is that code should be easy to read so that anyone that comes after you will be easily able to determine what exactly the code is doing, without tracing the logic out by hand and deciphering variable and function names. All of this is accomplished, according to Martin and company, by having beat-you-over-the-head names such as getNextDayOfWeek(), numberOfArguments, and isIntArg(). In addition, functions should be very small and do only one thing. Eventually, you will find that your code won't need comments, because the code itself is the documentation. The book says this many times in many ways, and with many different examples. All of the implementations are in Java, and most of the advice is geared towards it and other object-oriented languages. The 400-odd pages of the book are very well organized into 17 chapters. Despite being a programming book, the tone is very conversational and not at all dry- not quite a page-turner, but hardly something that will put you to sleep.<br /><br />It's a good book, but I can't help but take exception to some of the message. It is *ridiculous* to have many small functions. There is a point where all those functions become goto statements, and the supposedly high-level language looks more like the spaghetti code that is assembly language. Yes, the smaller functions are easier to test, but at what cost? All that overhead would slow the code down. Nevertheless, there are a lot of good take-aways from this book, no matter where you are in your programming career. After I finished reading I definitely looked at my own code with new eyes, and started making some changes for the better. I recommend this book as a companion to the other outstanding programming books ([[ASIN:0735619670 Code Complete]], [[ASIN:020161622X The Pragmatic Programmer]], etc.)

I had no idea what it was about and was taken aback when I started reading.  But, then couldn't put it down, the writer was so brillant and the material so informative. I was inspired, surprised and informed.  Such a great read.
B003X5UDEW|1.0|This movie is spectacular and my rating does not reflect my personal opinion towards the movie. Rather, it reflects how disappointed and annoyed I am that Amazon didn't specify that the original audio is replaced by English speakers. To me that just destroys the movie COMPLETELY, I mean what's the point in watching a FOREIGN FILM in English? Subtitles is perfectly fine I want to hear the original language. And I'm pretty sure since they specified you can't return an On Demand purchase, I will be stuck with wasting $12.99 on a file I will never open despite the beauty of the entire movie. Please be careful when purchasing this, I'm sure many have been ripped off making this purchase. Hopefully people decide to read customer reviews first unlike I did, however I didn't think I needed to, guess I was terribly wrong.
0439023513|2.0|The third and final installment the highly acclaimed Hunger Games ended on a low note for me. I recently finished the book and felt uneasy about it as a whole. I am a huge fan of the first two, but something about this one bothered me.<br /><br />I felt that Katniss' character seemed dull and I personally could not stand her in Mockingjay. I realize shes in her crazy state but its her charm and true voice that drove the series.<br /><br />What I thought to be a major fault in this novel was that it seemed like a rough draft. Collins would gloss over important events, merely telling rather than showing. Also, she would go on a Katniss-inner-conversation rant that took up pages and pages. I literally skipped these parts. Give me the meat, Collins!<br /><br />I was also quite shocked that there was absolutely no purpose to some of the deaths. Finnick's, for example, was highly unnecessary. Not only did it not affect the plot but when he died, there was barely any talk of him afterwards. For such a main character, he should at least received a few paragraphs of mourning's from the other characters. Its like killing off Harry Potter and never mentioning him after it!<br /><br />I'm quite fine with the whole not-a-perfect-ending thing. I just wished it would have been more thought out as it being the conclusion of it all.<br /><br />Overall, it felt unfinished, rushed, and ,as a fan, I felt displeased.
0938045768|4.0|This book teaches you how to become really strong using minimal equipment. You'll only need a place to hang from.    4 out of 5 stars, because of the high price.
0439023521|5.0|I put off reading this trilogy for a while because I am suspicious of things that tons of people seem to love (see Twilight), and because I feared it would be a treacly YA mess of tedious longing and calf-eyed nonsense with cartoon adults and spunky resilient kids.     However, I heard some podcasters I respect talking about loving this book, so I gave in a got it for my Kindle.  Bottom line: I devoured the entire 3 books and loved them all.  At no point did I think I was reading a YA novel. I was surprised that it is even marketed as such; not because it's too adult, but because it is exactly what I would want kids to read to learn about life.  This is what the YA genre SHOULD be about, in my opinion.       It's engaging and draws you in from the beginning.  The characters are developed and fascinating.  The plot takes turns I never expected; it's rare that a book makes my jaw drop as often as this one did from unexpected developments.  It also has elements of genuine humor and complete sadness; I never felt like the book was leading me step-by-step to an emotional response - they just happened organically. That's rare in any novel.     I loved the book, and while I am interested to see what the film will be like, I am fearful that the edges will be blunted by Hollywood in order to make it palatable to everyone, especially to the YA market I initially feared was the target audience for the book.      Read it!
0451450523|5.0|For Christmas I received a book titled, \\"The Last Unicorn\\".  I have never read or heard of this tale but I am a huge fan of mythical creatures and mythology and after reading the synopsis on the back, I knew this was going to be a book I would enjoy reading.  Thank you to Bobby who was the kind person who gave this gift to me.<br /><br />The story is about a unicorn, no surprise here as the title clearly explains that, who embarks on a quest to find others of her kind.  She steps out of her forest home and steps into an adventure full of mystery and magic.  She meets up with a magician named Schmendrick; he helps in rescuing her from the clutches of Mommy Fortuna's Midnight Carnival.  Her other companion is a woman named Molly who is a big believer in Unicorns and legends.  This threesome makes their way to King Haggard's castle to find the Red Bull, who is believed to have captured all the unicorns.<br /><br />There is so much more to the story than the simple synopsis I wrote above but I don't want to give away any of the fun adventures the unicorn finds herself in.  I will say that if you have children or if you would like to read a fun tale that is simply written, then this is a book you want to pick up.<br /><br />The story is told in a wonderful way that will awaken your imagination.  Plus the story isn't a one dimension tale but a multi directional story.  Each new person the unicorn meets brings another layer to the story and enhances the main plot.  And although the story was written for the young reader, adults will also become involved in the tragic tale of truth, love, and of the consequences that result in the choices we make.<br /><br />Five stars for this book - The Last Unicorn!<br /><br />For more reviews, check out my blog at decemberjoy.wordress.com

So there are a lot of good minds reading \\"Bad Science.\\"<br /><br />Very highly recommended.

B002ZG980U|3.0|I realize that this movie has generally received very good reviews, so I'm in the minority in saying that it didn't do much for me.<br /><br />At a micro level, the visuals are effective and there's enough action to make the movie reasonably entertaining.  The acting is also generally good enough.<br /><br />However, on the macro level, the nested dreams concept just seemed complicated for the sake of being complicated, and it wasn't done in a way that generated much intrigue for me.  In fact, I found it almost boringly tedious.  And even more broadly, this movie doesn't seem to have any point, any serious reflections on the human condition.  Yes, it does obviously raise the question of how we can distinguish dreams from reality, but there's nothing new there, and other movies have done a much better job with this theme.  Moreover, the notion that people would go to all this trouble for the sake of business espionage strikes me as being silly and bordering on cartoonish.<br /><br />In the end, I find this movie to be something of a pretender - somewhat entertaining, but a pretender nonetheless.

B0040UAYI4|5.0|If you are a PC gamer and would like to use the same controls for a PS3 this is what you want. I am using the Eagle eye with the Razer Imperator mouse and the Cyber Snipa Game Pad V2. Have used the Logitech MX 518 mouse but I wanted more buttons. The Eagle Eye works flawlessly once you set it up correctly. To get all of the Razor mouse buttons to work you have to update the firmware to the latest. If you want to snipe you can pick enemies off easy at any range. Have used this with Black Ops and Modern Warfare 2 without any glitches. But you may have to play around with the settings to get it to your own personal taste. Took me a little while but now have it setup and it makes game play easy and enjoyable. It wont take you from a noob to a veteran as it is still the same person on the other end of the control but if you have played games on a PC and want to go to a PS3 the transition is easy. You won't waste any time crossing over as it is exactly the same playing the PS3 as playing the PC. Some of the Turbo features wont work on certain games but I found I didnt need them. Don't map any letters or numbers from the keyboard to the mouse as they more than likely won't work. You need a mouse with memory on board to keep the mouse settings which unfortunately means you need to use a PC to set up your mouse. Other than that I have used a Split Fish Frag Pro and while it was good the Eagle is better. If you buy this just make sure the mouse and keyboard is compatible and you won't be wasting your money. Great product and good after sales back up.I am using a PC with Win7 64bit and had no problems using software to set up the device. The mouse moves flawlessly once you set the deadzone and sensitivity. Only problem I had with the sensitivity was when you aim down the sight it does slow the movement down but that can be fixed with either the in game or Eagle Eye or with the mouse I am using that has buttons on the top to adjust the sensitivity.
B0034G4P7Q|2.0|I really don't understand. Aside from decent acting, I saw no reason to see this film or why the gaudy reviews stamped on it's dvd cover were even written. The founder of Facebook was smart and wealthy enough to get into Harvard, so he was hardly a hard-luck case, he ripped off a couple of already existing social networks, stole ideas and money from \\"friends\\" of his and somehow I'm supposed to be impressed that he's the youngest billionaire in history? Sorry, but I wasn't. When something comes along that 14-25 year-olds see as cooler than Facebook, I'm guessing he won't be a billionaire or relevant anymore.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I am a fun of Micheal and I was very happy his last rehersal was put on DVD for us to get a chance to see him doing what he likes best. This DVD contains some of the best selling videos. When I purchased the video I saw some of Micheal's customes and the designer who explained the way Micheal likes his customes. Apart from his dancing skills, you see that Micheal was someone who loves something new everyday. The man put his philosophy and his strength into his music. You see his humble side. Awalys telling his people \\"I LOVE YOU\\". From the video I was able to get the first hand information from the very people he performed with, and I really understood who Micheal was. I will recommend very one to buy this video and keep it safely for years.

Mine is on why this was published posthumously. And the way it appears in print.<br /><br />And the reason is: \\"TA DA!!!!!!\\" Every writer needs an editor.<br /><br />This is about 1/4 longer than it needs to be to be a competent, detailed, thriller. But it (and the other two books) are clogged with journalistic and procedural detail that make you want to point an IKEA staple gun to your forehead. And press \\"Repeat Fire.\\"<br /><br />Maybe if you had no idea about the day-to-day procedural workings of investigative journalists this would be interesting. But Larsson spends pages and pages on the hero *re*writing* stuff he has already done. I'm seriosu. Just when the action gets interesting, he brews coffee and spends a week re-writing what he knows. That is WHOLE CHAPTERS of action.<br /><br />Yep, that is the way real life writers work.<br /><br />They also go to the toilet and take a dump.<br /><br />But no one ever writes it up in detail.<br /><br />Except Larsson.<br /><br />Sadly, because of his death his prose has now become \\"deathless prose.\\" While there is a rollicking good story in here, it is buried under useless muck.

B002ZG9940|1.0|I don't understand why did George Clooney accepted this role!!! The events in this movie move so slowly; I actually fell asleep in the middle of it. What is the point of this film? I don't get it. The plot is very weak, and shows lack of technical knowledge of the weapons used. I expected a film with this caliber of star and director to be better written. The only good thing about this film is the cinematography, which showcases the beauty of the Italian country side and it's old tiny villages. Add to that the constant extreme close up of George Clooney's face and his naked behind (who by the way looks very old in it). Finally, what is the point of all the nudity and sex scenes? does it add to the story besides trying to proof that Mr Clooney is still a sex symbol and can get any European Beauty to bed!! I am very disappointed with the steady stream of bad, hastily made Hollywood movies.
B00005Q3TZ|4.0|Let me go ahead and just say that Titanic is my most favorite movie and that I also like The Notebook. I like period romantic films especially set around tragic events.     With that said, I like Pearl Harbor. The first time I saw it, I hated it. Saw it on tv a few months back and hated it. Finally decided to rent it and I guess 3rd time is the charm because then I realized it was a good movie.     This movie is most definitely not for everyone. It is true, this movie has the romance and tragedy of Titanic, the gore and war of Saving Private Ryan, and the buddy relationship and flying of Top Gun. This movie is not for serious war buffs. It is first and foremost like Titanic and The Notebook, a love story.    It is kind of like a war movie lite. Someone like me could not sit through war movies like Saving Private Ryan or miniseries such as Band of Brothers because of their grittiness.     I think Pearl Harbor's biggest flaws happen to be that they tried to pass it off as an action flick rather than emphasize what it truly is-a romance film.    I do think the movie lacks in some areas which still get irritating. I hate the intercuts between the love story and the Japanese plotting against Pearl Harbor. I feel it would have been better had they just focused in one specific storyline and just went with that instead.     Also the lines are pretty cheesy and corny at times.     But its definitely a movie for any girl that likes romance stories or maybe even finds Ben Affleck or Josh Hartnett to be yummy to look at it. It is not a movie for people who take this subject matter serious. From what I heard there are better versions out there on the events of Pearl Harbor such as Tora Tora Tora.     But nonetheless I will give it 4 out of 5 stars. It will never be Titanic but it is a good movie to watch and the sets are so beautiful that one could watch the movie just for that alone.     Whether you like the movie or not will strongly depend on what you want from movies.

B002ZG999U|5.0|I thought this had humor as well as the expected action and some of the \\"kill\\" shots were pretty awesome.  It's good to see these old guys can still pack a punch and do it with laughs as well.  Stallone did a good job with the cast as well as directing the movie.
B001U3Y5XE|3.0|We've had this game for a couple of months now and it got a lot of play early on and now no one in the family suggests that we play it whenever we have time for games. First off, we don't have any of the cool new lego kits so I actually felt that there were some really neat pieces that came with the game. There were some fun hinges, springy antennas, spinning disks, and even a long red flame. If we end up truly giving up on the game and assimilating the pieces from this game into our lego collection I'll at least feel that it's not a total waste. Given some of the specialized pieces and the price I've seen for some of the specialized lego kits, the price is actually a reasonable deal.<br /><br />The game play is frustrating at times. It's essentially Pictionary with legos, but they really didn't put much thought into the rules. Players take turns rolling a die which shows you a topic. You then choose from the easy, medium, or hard deck. We looked at a lot, if not all, of the cards. We could not see what the distinguishing factor was between the easy, medium, or hard cards. The kids chose the easy ones with great frequency but I didn't find them any different than some of the hard cards (or vice-versa).<br /><br />The pictures on the cards are drawings, and they are rather vague at times. The rules don't offer anything concrete, so you have to decide what you accept as a correct guess. For example, I had a card that had an ocean liner on it. It looked a lot like the Titanic, but I was not sure if the acceptable guess should be \\"ocean liner\\" or \\"Titantic\\", or even something else. I accepted either, in the end. Many of the cards have this type of vagueness to them. One of the topics is \\"nature\\" and those cards are the hardest. I once drew a card that had a picture of a t-bone steak on it. I'm not sure I'd consider that \\"nature\\" but I can't tell you how someone would build that out of a few legos. I gave up on that one.<br /><br />We found that the standard game of going around in turns caused people in our family to become impatient. So, we made for a more-engaging version of the game by having 3 people build at once and the 4th guesses each one. We sometimes gave a point if they were able to guess right in one try, or three tries, and sometimes we said that the builder gets 3 points if the guesser guesses right away, 2 points on the second guess, and 1 point if they guess in 3 tries. Still, I think that there have been enough missed guesses over the games we play that people just found it too frustrating (my daughters are 10 and 12), and I think also that we have such positive associations with legos that turning it into a competitive game seems to really detract from that. I think that's part of what's working against this game, along with the poorly-drawn cards and vague directions.d people in our family to become impatient.

0307914550|4.0|I've always been interested in running, but had to stop several years ago due to knee pain.  Still, the title and premise of this book intrigued me and I bought the audio book to listen while commuting to and from work.    Long story short...I am running again now.  This book opened my eyes to a \\"new\\" way of running that has enabled me to run without any pain in my knees.  You really need to read (or listen to) this book if you have any interest at all in running.    There is a section toward the end where the author goes into a diatribe about how the human race has \\"evolved\\" over the last few millenniums.  As a creationist, I disagree with that part (and particularly how Evolution isn't even discussed as a \\"theory\\" - it is just assumed to be science).  In spite of that, this book is well worth a read.  I am excited because the information contained in it has allowed me to again start running.
B004IAR4Q6|5.0|Aside from the negative production/mix barbs thrown at T-Bone Burnett,  this is a splendid comeback album for the ages.  Is it me or is Gregg's voice stronger than ever?  Gregg's liver transplant would have taken down most people but his music conviction has taken him to new musical heights.  I thought that his \\"Laid Back\\" album was his best solo album, but now I'm not so sure.    We've missed you Gregg and welcome back indeed.  Now when is that next ABB album going to hit the streets?

0525421580|4.0|I'm a huge fan of both of these authors, especially David Levithan. So I can't think of two better authors to write a book together. Both David and John have a different way of approaching YA. They don't dumb it down. Their writing is intelligent, funny, and original.<br /><br />When I was reading this book I kept thinking that whimsical is a good word to explain it, but now I don't know. Its still a good word, but whimsical brings to mind a lighthearted, cheerful read. Which this was at times, but it's also full of strong emotions and tough situations. One of the things I loved most about this book was that it shines light on the fact that most of the time our emotions are the things that tear our relationships apart. Not some outside entity, its usually our own messed up, self destructive feelings and those feelings are never more prevalent than when you're a teen.<br /><br />The characters were all fabulous! Will Grayson #1 has always been overshadowed by his best friend Tiny, and Will Grayson #2 is completely alone in the world. Both of them are just trying to find themselves. The character growth throughout the book was amazing! And we can't forget the side characters, one very big side character, Tiny Cooper! Tiny stole the scene every time he was in it! Sometimes I wanted to smack him, but he truly was Fabulous!<br /><br />Will Grayson, Will Grayson is a ingenious book that should be on everyone's must read list! It has everything that you would want in a novel, so you will definitely find something to love!
B004AHNIGM|4.0|I gotta tip my hat off to Gregg Allman...I thought he was pretty much done with music until I saw this album pop up on Amazon. As a long-time Allman Bros. fan, I was pretty underwhelmed with Gregg's vocal performance on the Allman Bros. Live at The Beacon CD from 2003 or 2004 (I can't remember which). It didn't sound like he had much vocal power, and he struggled to stay on key during the slower, mellow songs. Then when he couldn't even make it to Clapton's Crossroads gig last year due to medical issues, I thought for sure he was all but finished.    Happily, this album has proved me wrong! He does a bang-up job singing on all these great blues cuts...a real natural! I don't think he's ever recorded an album like this, where he just does his thing with a bunch of blues standards, like Clapton did with \\"From The Cradle\\". A great idea, and he knocks it out of the ballpark. Great bunch of musicians, too, as I've been a fan of Doyle Bramhall II for quite a while, and it's nice to see Dr. John step in and add his talents.    Musically, the only aspect I could have lived without are the big horn arrangements on some of these tunes. It was cool on the first tune that had them, but they wore out their welcome pretty fast after that.    Another minor gripe is that there isn't enough Gregg featured on his trusty ol' B3. He's never been a virtuoso player, but hearing a whole album of Gregg Allman without much B3 to go along with it just doesn't seem right for me! One song featured Dr. John taking a solo, which was great of course, then Gregg sings another verse, and...another Dr. John solo. Uhh, how about a guitar solo, or better yet, a B3 solo by Gregg? That's not a huge deal, but just something I noticed.    Overall though, I'm really stoked about this album...don't know why the Allman Bros. haven't released an album in 8 years, but at least we can hear ol' Gregg still belting it out--better than he has in years! RECOMMENDED!
B003YFIUW8|2.0|I'm sorry, but I read this book over the course of about two weeks and I genuinely was not looking forward to pick it up each day.  I get that writing is an art and art is anything that drives a reaction from those that view it, but this book was simply a form of art that I didn't like.  The narration from the child's perspective drove me insane.  Also, the child's constant desire to have \\"some\\" simply grossed me out.      I can honestly not recommend this book to anyone.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|I was pretty skeptical of this movie and not really sure what to expect. There are alot of long time (good) actors in this movie that let you just get right into the movie. The action just comes out of nowhere and is fantastic. There is a chase scene that involves Bruce Willis that has a moment in it that just wowed me and my wife.<br /><br />I would say this movie stands up to repeated watches and you can take more stuff away on future watches.
B0021L8V0M|3.0|Naturally, the plot does not make sense, but some characters do, the action is non-stop (while way beyond even remotely believable) and the filming is great.  Among other things, the plot of the movie includes the notion of the modern Russia as a completely lawless society.  It rings so true that nobody notices: Russian career officer on active duty is given an order to kill the sitting president of Russia as a tough but otherwise completely routine assignment.
B002GOAH1A|3.0|This movie gets a lot of grief, and it's easy to see why.  A TV show from the childhoods an entire generation (it was made in the 1960s and syndicated as a rerun in the 1970s) is made into a movie at a time when the show is not fresh in anyone's minds nor readily available on home video.  The generation remembers adventure in the Old West with a James Bond twist, great production values and characters who were super cool.  Yes, that generation is right, but in the years that have passed, they forgot (like the makers of some of the recent James Bond movies) what made the show so much fun.  It never took itself quite seriously.<br /><br />With The Wild Wild West available on DVD now, it's still cool to hate the movie and love the TV series even if you've never watched it or haven't since the 70s.  Well, I'm not going to comment on the collective's ability to dismiss what is a perfectly fun movie as trash while having no recent memory of the show the movie is based on.  What I am going to say is that Wild Wild West actually does a great job of bringing the spirit of the 1960s TV show to a modern audience.  If there hadn't been so much belly-aching when it came out, it could have started a new generation loving the old show.  Of course, Robert Conrad's outspoken criticism of the movie didn't help.<br /><br />I am a big (read: freaking huge) fan of The Wild Wild West.  It combined the adventure of the Old West with the intrigue and suspense of James Bond.  The main attraction, of course, is the playful relationship between Jim West and Artemus Gordon (or, if you're a woman with simple tastes, Robert Conrad's sculpted behind in tight pants).  Each episode had a similar structure - Jim and Artie have to protect someone or something, that someone or something is stolen or kidnapped, they track down the culprit who turns out to be a lunatic with some strange idea of taking over the country or the world, Jim goes in with guns blazing and gets captured, Artie goes in with a disguise and breaks Jim out, then they both get captured and put in an elaborate death trap from which they escape using their genius and Artie's gadgetry, and, in the end, Jim gets the girl while Artie is left to make the coffee on the Wanderer (their train).  Each episode had its own take on that format, but that was sort of the standard plot.<br /><br />Artie's gadgets on the show were usually simple - buttons that burned through wood, a derringer on a rail in Jim's sleeve, glasses that allow one to see certain chemicals.  The villains had more elaborate displays - a bubbling machine that runs on the brains of geniuses, a giant flamethrower cannon, and various death traps that used lightning or solar energy.  The king lunatic of their enemies was the resourceful Dr. Loveless, played by the absolutely irreplaceable Michael Dunn.<br /><br />While there was no way a movie without Robert Conrad, Ross Martin, and Michael Dunn could entirely capture the spirit of the original show, the writers made an honest attempt.  In fact, besides the obvious story arc similarities, there were numerous references to the TV show including Selma Hayek's story which matches a first-season episode in which the main woman (Chinese rather than Mexican) turns out to be married.  Some of the gadgetry from the show appears in the film.  Dr. Loveless is probably the strangest deviation from the original show with his exaggerated southern accent and missing bottom half of his body rather than simply short stature.  The main criticisms most people have of the film are that it had too many one-liners and a lot of over-the-top machines.  As for the one-liners... the original show is full of them!  Jim and Artie make bad puns constantly, and Jim delivers one-liners with the gusto of the worst of James Bond (but still retains his awesome dignity because he's freaking Robert Conrad).  The machines were simply a product of modern movie-making.  The gadgetry of the original show would seem incredibly tame to modern audiences because it was stuff that could be built easily and quickly (and cheaply) for many episodes in one season.  In a movie, you can make a lot of big stuff or animate a lot of big stuff, so they did.  And all of the gadgets are pretty darn cool-looking, even the bemoaned giant spider.  It's funny, but at the time the movie came out, another movie came out called Atlantis: The Lost Empire.  This Disney vehicle was also criticized for being strange.  Yet, today people have realized that it was actually a neat movie because that steampunk aesthetic caught on.<br /><br />Sadly, no one will accept that over-the-top steampunk look in Wild Wild West because they're too busy comparing it to their finest memories of the Wild Wild West TV show, and that's too bad because it's a fun movie.  Hey, whatever floats your boat, but don't go telling me that I shouldn't be having fun watching something I like.

B0043GXYBO|3.0|The day Zoey Redbird was marked changed her life forever.  However, it didn't change for the worse.  It changed for the better.  At home she had to live with her stepfather, who was a member of a religious group that made her life very difficult.  He thought of Zoey as going down the wrong path in life.  Her mother, of course, listened more to her husband than her daughter.  The day she was marked causes her parents to want to keep her from going to the House of Night, a school for fledgling vampyres-the only chance she has of surviving the change.  With her grandmother's help, she arrives at the House of Night, but not before having a strange vision/dream that seems to have affected her mark.  At the House of Night, Zoey meets a group of friends who become the family she never really had.  Her time at House of Night isn't all that easy.  Zoey starts being haunted by ghosts of students who didn't survive the change.  She also has attracted the attention of school hottie, Erik, and his ex-girlfriend, Aphrodite.  Zoey also has to deal with the fact that her ex-boyfriend, Heath, refuses to be an ex.  Oh, and her markings/tattoos seem to be growing and changing everyday.<br /> I was very hesitant to pick up this book/series.  I had read many mixed reviews on the series as a whole-people either loved it or hated it.  I thought I'd get about halfway through Marked before putting it down; so I never started them.  That is, until my sister-in-law lent me the first 5 books in the series and told me that they were amazingly good.  I didn't love it.  But it was really interesting and I found myself wanting to find out what happened next.  The world is well-crafted.  It is a world filled with pagan rituals, vampyres, and special powers.  The People of Faith reminded me of the Fellowship of the Sun from True Blood.  Zoey is forced into a world that from the outside looks like a curse, but to Zoey its much better than life before she was marked.  Her friends are great and help her throughout the book.  Zoey's thoughts on characters and situations is shown through the narration-Zoey's POV.  I felt like I was in Zoey's head, seeing everything through her eyes.<br /> Overall, I enjoyed it.

B0043GAZYS|4.0|First off, if you haven't seen Scott Pilgrim, it's an awesome film. Perfect for anyone who grew up with Nintendo and Napster. It's music, it's video games, but most of all- despite what you might expect- it's really great film making!     Secondly, I'm tired of paying $30-40 for Blu-Ray bundles. I didn't buy a blu-ray player so that I could keep buying DVD's and if I only had a DVD player what good is bundling the blu-ray??? I just don't get it. I'm on board with digital copies but I am not a fan of bundling all these things together just to make a buck. Stop it. Please.
B004B32532|5.0|I was first made aware of Jodorowsky about 8 years ago via Roger Ebert's Great Movies column and from reading about his films in The Scarecrow Video Movie Guide. At that point in time, his movies were very hard to find on video. I eventually ran across a VHS copy of Santa Sangre at my local Hollywood Video and was amazed by the visuals and Jodoowsky's filmmaking technique.   I was very eager to see El Topo and the Holy Mountain, especially after seeing the documentary Midnight Movies, which features a section about El Topo and has some clips from the film  itself. I found Fando and Lis from Netflix and found it very intersting, but not nearly as compelling as Santa Sangre. Finally when The Films of Alejandro Jodowsky box set came out in 2007, I was able to see El Topo and The Holy Mountain.   The visual language that Jodorowsky creates reminds me somewhat of Fellini and Pier Paolo Pasolini, but it is still distinctly his own. He combines the fantastical, mystical, and grotesque to make stories and images that are rarely seen in the cinema.  I have considered buying a bootleg of Santa Sangre over the years, but I'm glad that I resisted now that this film is finally on Blu ray. The special features are outstanding and give some great insight into what it is like to work with Jodorowsky. Jodorowsky seems to be an open book here and he gives the interviewers a wealth of information about his art, his process, and even personal details about his life. I haven't watched them all yet, but I am looking very forward to being able to explore his films for years to come. Now in his early 80's, I hope that Jodorowsky will have the opportunity to make another film someday (sooner rather than later!).
B0031RAOVY|4.0|I'm not one who writes a blow by blow detail of a movie. Not that there is anything wrong with that. You already know what it's basically about. And I'm not going to spoil it for you with all the details nor will I give \\"spoiler alerts\\". I will say this was a heart felt movie and tears did run down my face. Movies to me are so hard to review because we are all so different in what we like and what we think is good acting and not so good. But if this sounds like a movie for you I don't think you will be disappointed. The acting is good. As well as the story line. It is based on a true story. The dog is amazingly well trained and a beautiful Akita!!! I actually bought this movie as a gift for my friend who owns a male Akita. I knew she would love it for the dog alone. I do recommend watching this movie. The story is wonderful. Oh don't forget a box of Kleenex. ;)
B0037A4ILC|5.0|Since my earliest years, I have been devoted to tales like this. When I was very young, Walt Disney did a two- or three-part story about an ascent of the Matterhorn, which drove me to read my first account of mountain climbing; in later life, I have viewed and read many more such accounts. I am still baffled by the insanity and dedication of the sport of climbing; but even the worst of filmology concerning it grips me. This is in the top echelon of historical - or even fiction - recounting of a deadly, high-skill enterprise.<br /><br />From the beginning, you are swept up in the story. In 1936, two climbers from Bavaria - Andreas Hinterstoisser and Toni Kurz - decided to tap into the German fervor to conquer the Eiger, leaving their positions in the Army to attempt glory for the Reich. Actually, if we are to believe the story, they did it for themselves; but the Reich had put a high amount of importance on Germany's successful ascent of the North Face of the Eiger ahead of anybody else. Andi and Toni joined a base camp complete with teams from Austria (not yet incorporated in the circle of the Reich), France and Italy. The ruggedness of the men involved is apparent from the elementary equipment they employ (think canvas tents, simple woolen mittens, and basic, but sturdy, outerwear - nothing like today's high-tech enwrapments), and shows the difficulties in setting up camp and the slyness of heading out in the middle of the night to beat the other teams.<br /><br />Also involved is a young woman who grew up with both of the Bavarian climbers, and who is now a cub reporter at a paper in Berlin, tapped to cover the story of her two friends' attempt on the mountain by her boss, who accompanies her to the hotel near the base camp on Eiger and who clearly has more personal aspirations where she is concerned. The young woman, Luise, is in love with Toni, and her concern for every aspect of his climb is heartbreakingly detailed, as she worries from the observation deck and with every achieved viewing of their climb. Somewhat knowedgeable about climbing herself, she knows something of what they are going through; you agonize with her every minute she is on film.<br /><br />I began watching this film very late at night, sleepy; twenty minutes into it, I was wide awake, and the further into the climb I got, the more icy fingers crept down my spine and clutched at my stomach. The beauty of the landscape as seen from the mountain is offset by the unspeakable horror of being trapped on the traverse by avalanches, rockfalls, and howling snowstorms; you watch the movie with the fascination of going by a 14-car pileup on the highway - scared to death of the outcome, but unable to look away. The pathos is added to by the fact that a railway tunnel cuts through the mountain to the summit, with viewing windows cut into the face of Eiger at strategic spots, and at one of these windows, the troubled climbers could be heard and seen but not reached. Constantly juxtaposed is the dichotomy of the climbers on the mountain facing impossible odds and the warmth and civility of the hotel beneath them, with its comfortable clientele, dining in four-star opulence and cosying up to the fireplace.<br /><br />A movie that must have been technically hugely difficult to film, but done so well, with excellent dialogue and stunning scenery, it comes highly recommended for anyone interested in a real-life thrill ride. Subtitled, but don't let that stop you; this is a footnote of history that will make the commute from work to home seem banal and innocent by comparison.ieved viewing of their climb.

0385341679|5.0|This book was worth the wait.  I devoured it in a matter of days to find out what happened to all my favorite characters.  It had some great twists and turns (none of which I want to give away), and a lot of emotion.  I loved Shadowfever! I don't want to say too much more for fear of giving something away.  I think anyone who has read books 1-4 will enjoy this.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|this book was absolutly amazing my friend had been begging me to read this series for months but i just ignored it and continued to read anything else that would occupy my time then one day walking through target i just happen to pick it up and throw it in the shopping cart i got home and started reading and couldnt stop. maggie stiefvater really knows how to draw in an audiance and make them believe even the most unlikly of situations there were characters i loved and characters i hated and thats what makes an amazing book.
630587493X|5.0|Every time I see this movie I come away amazed at how well it was done.  Robin Williams is very good in this role, and Embeth Davidtz does a fabulous job.  It's funny but not a comedy.  It's futuristic but not sci fi.  At its heart it is a drama, and a very enjoyable one at that.
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|UNIVERSAL really outdid themselves on this one. A truly masterful remastering of the inimitable Norman Bates or MASTER BATES as he's known   to those in the know. THIS TRANSFER is a delicious blend of clarity that made my viewing seem like I was seeing for the VERY FIRST TIME. LIKE A VIRGIN...  you know what i mean? INCREDIBLE!!!  The blacks so amazingly rich and deep and they didnt skimp out with those irritating bars on the left or right  or top and bottom but a true 16x9 experience completely covering my magnificent 65 inch screen. AHHH the joy..the beauty of it all. I whole heartedly recommend this blu-ray experience to those PSYCHO babbling maniacs..(like me) and you will be enraptured and blissfully endowed with Hitch's brilliant  true horror film that had the world on its knees back in 1960 those 50 years ago.

B0034G4OUO|5.0|Faster is a straight up revenge flick with just enough dialogue to keep the story rolling. The focus here is gritty action as Driver (Dwayne Johnson) seeks out everyone involved in his brother's murder. This is The Rock that's been missing from all the kiddie movies and comedies he's been in over the last few years. This is what action fans like me have been waiting for since he started acting. Faster proves that Dwayne Johnson can sit at the table with Schwarzeneggar, Stallone, Willis, Statham and other action stars who didn't appear in The Expendables. I just hope he keeps this up.

B004IAR4Q6|4.0|There is barely anyone on this planet more qualified to sing these great blues standards than the Gregg Allman a rock n roll survivor par excellence. His story encompasses the great first incarnation of the Allman Brothers Band with \\"Live at Fillmore East\\" the true monument to their genius, the tragic death of his brother Duane Allman possibly the best rock guitarist to have picked up a Gibson, his own descent into drugs hell where his infamous \\"grass\\" of roadie John \\"Scooter\\" Herring saw the latter get 75 years while GA got immunity and the failed on/off marriage to Cher. In recent years Gregg Allman has also had a liver transplant and suffers from Hepatitis C. While the Allman Brothers have carried in various incarnations the music has relied heavily on past glories.<br /><br />Allman as a result has taken stock and by doing so gone even deeper into the blues roots of the Allman Brothers producing an album of 11 covers and one new original song the truly excellent \\"Just another rider\\" (for info the album has been streaming for weeks on NPR and Rolling Stone for those who may wish to check it out). He has also added the extra dimension of the hottest producer working in music today namely T Bone Burnett fresh from triumphs with Robert Plant, Alison Krauss, B B King and Elvis Costello. The results are very impressive and sees Allman return to form with his graveled voice older and wiser but sounding stronger than it has for years. The highlights on Low Country Blues are many not least the stunning smokey version of Amos Milburn's \\"Tears, Tears, Tears\\" which reeks southern fried atmosphere and evokes Ray Charles and sees that old rogue Dr John producing one of his finest piano solos in years. The Muddy Waters standard \\"I can't be satisfied\\" skips along at a fine old pace with its swampy Burnett production and brilliant bottleneck guitar accompaniment. Skip James's \\"Devil got a woman\\" is stripped right back by Burnett in an austere remake acoustic but one which sees Allman vocally at his best and guitarist Doyle Bramhall II completely inspired. Allman has always loved the songs of Bobby Bland and the brassy version here of \\"Blind Man\\" is tighter than a vice. Finally on the cover of Otis Rush's \\"Checking on my baby\\" he manages to evoke memories of Fillmore East an album which this reviewer would run into a burning building to retrieve.<br /><br />Granted the cover of John Lee Hooker's \\"I believe I'll go back home\\" is a bit workmanlike and no new ground is broken here. But this is not an album of surprises and as Allman's first outing in 14 years it is a hugely welcome return with a set of songs impeccably chosen by Burnett and delivered by a great singer. The Midnight Rider is back and doing what he does best.ocally at his best and guitarist Doyle Bramhall II completely inspired.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|I don't know where this game has been all my life. Sadly, you need 3 people to play it, though, so my husband and I can't play it on our own. It changes every time, and it is a lot of fun. I know this game hardly needed MY review on it, it has an obsessive world wide following, but there it is. Fun, different, and extremely social.<br /><br />Don't play it with people who are dedicated to being cutthroat jerks, though. I was glad that a friend of ours decided to give this another chance.. it could lend itself to that kind of 'win win win' mentality.
1594202842|5.0|I just finished reading this book and I really like it. This is not a book about which method of parenting is superior, but the author's struggle with her two kids and her traditional way of parenting.    \\"Battle Hymn\\" is good and light read. Most chapters are 4-6 pages. My main theme of this book is about Amy Chua's life with her kids and their musical lives. (One daughter plays the piano and the other the violin).    It is very fun to hear Chua's perspective as being the daughter of immigrants, of course her father was an ivy-league professor and she went to Harvard and now teaches at Yale. So I would change the dynamic of her model from Chinese vs Western to Chinese vs Upper Class New England.    Overall I really enjoyed this books and would recommend it anyone.    ps Don't think for a second that this book has anything to do with child abuse!
0880796863|5.0|Great tool for learnig Tarot and easy to understand for first timers or those wanting to learn. Nice art work and illustrations on cards with lots of details. Comes with a manual that is easy to use and understand once you start to understand. Great for those that teach others the art to offer to their students in class.

0439023521|5.0|I've been looking for a new series to read in between other authors.  I ran across this book on Amazon and after reading the reviews ordered the set.  I've become slightly obsessed with the series and found a place to read the books online.  I was going to read the first few pages of The Hunger Games, and ended up so engrossed in the book I read the whole thing in about 2 1/2 hours.  The main character is extremely relatable, and Collin's has you aligning yourself with her by the end of the first chapter.  I'm trying to dissuade myself from reading Catching Fire online as well, and just wait for my books to arrive.... patiently.  :)
0811729117|2.0|A reasonable read although I think a lot's been lost in the translation. It does however provide a good insight into what it must have been like driving a Tiger during the war.  Panzer Commander by Hans Von Luck is a much much better read.

B002BU0DPE|5.0|I got these so I could play games while not disturbing my room mate.  I wish I had them a long time ago.  It's amazing how big of a difference they make in game play.  You hear things you would never pick up even with an amazing surround sound system.  You are able to pick up on sounds from people walking around in a game from far away and know exactly where they are relative to you.  The sound quality is phenomenal.  They have a really deep, rich sound with bass control.  The headset has an \\"expander\\" function that I don't personally use.  The voice quality is amazing.  A huge step up from using a bluetooth headset.  And all of my friends say that I sound way better.  The only real problem I have is that the volume controls are really touchy.  When I clip the controls to my shirt, I sometimes will hit the volume knob and turn down the volume all the way down with my sleeve.  That being said, I was able to adjust where I put it and dont do it nearly as often after having it a couple of days.      Since I have these plugged into the outgoing plugs of my tv rather than having the PS3 signal pass through, I am also able to watch movies and television which is also nice.    Highly recommended headset.

B000J10EQU|1.0|after many years of waiting for a new superman movie ,  the rebooted franchise hit   rock bottom with this rather insulting, atrocious return of the man of steel. superman returns proved to be nothing but a disaster with its bad acting, bad cgi and rather bland plot. both lead actors , brandon routh and kate bosworth share no real on screen chemistry and their performances are rather wooden, unconvincing and atrocious.tom welling and erica durance's on screen chemistry and overall performance on smallville is far more convincing and superior ,in fact making both brandon routh and kate bosworth look like amateur actors.the only well cast actor is kevin spacey as lex luther. kevin spacey makes a darker and ultimately intersting, modern lex luther. however this is not enough to save the plot from being bland , eventless and at some levels laughable as the director,bryan singer has brandon routh hopelessly trying to recreate some of christopher reeve's facial expressions and even his lines(eg. flying is still the safest way to travel) from \\"superman the movie\\". not only does the flying , cgi superman look fake but even more so does the cgi, marlon brando, jor/el in the fortress of solitude.i am quite sure, the late marlon brando whould find his fake, looking likeness quite insulting. even the so called modernized superman costume is questionable with its almost pink/ maroon,like cape. superman's cape is suppose to be bright red. lets hope the upcoming new superman movie , with its recasting and redirection will  bring us the exciting and eventfull superman on the big screen fans have been yearning for since \\"superman the movie\\" and help us forget the abortion that was superman returns.
B004KPQK2S|2.0|I had heard good things about this flick when it came out in theatres, but was disappointed when I finally got around to renting it.     The film was not dynamic with few (but predictable) plot twists, the acting was mediocre, and the story was generally uninteresting. I actually enjoy when films like this are Hollywoodized, with a little extra drama added to the story, making it more interesting (and historically incorrect, I know, but much more interesting to watch... I don't go to the movies for a history lesson). I was disappointed that there was no real \\"drama\\" - horse racing is always a gamble, and Penny Chenery was no exception; she just happened to get lucky this time.     And the movie is nearly 2 hours long - much longer than it needed to be.     If you need an inspiring horse racing flick, Seabiscuit is much better (check out Rotten Tomatoes).
B004DK49DW|4.0|A solid effort from Mike & the boys. It's bluesier than \\"Sex Love & Rock 'n Roll\\" but just as melodic, if perhaps less catchy. The songwriting remains top notch as ever. The clichè is true: they DO age like a fine wine.

I can play all of my games at ultra definition without the computer even breaking a sweat!  I can rip a dvd, play a video game and download movies all at the same time with no lag.  Compared to the highly over priced Intel x6 core this processor performs beautifully for a fraction of the price!

B000JBWWQ0|1.0|Seriously, I understand that energy is real and that there are some interesting points regarding the nature of energy in the film and certain gifts, but this was an absolutely terrible movie. I just woke up from a nap and realized, out of nowhere, that I had to write this review to warn people: this is a super crappy movie.   Side note, the concept that all religions lead down the same path and that energy somehow syncs them all together works if you are treading the kiddy pool of religion/spirituality and not looking in to them with any real depth. Surface level, that position is valid because there are many similarities, but there are also enough foundational, core aspects to the different religions that make them fundamentally different in what they believe is true and to not take these differences in to account is to live in a spiritual fantasy land where if we close our eyes everything looks the same. I'm all for treating fellow human beings with dignity and respect, but that does not extend in to saying I believe the same thing if I really don't. That kind of reasoning doesn't make us more mature, it just ignores real issues in the spiritual realm.  Please don't waste your money or time, even if you are in to New Age religion, this is a really bad movie.  God bless.
B00005JL1C|5.0|Trying to remember the few romances I've seen and came up with more than I thought. I really loved this movie, it's one of my treasured keeper films. I know, I know, propaganda alert, but I did enjoy everything about it purely as a story with no subversive Catholic crap approved of. Mary Stuart Masterson is the beautiful, tough girl outcast, Watts, who is secretly in love with her mechanic best friend, Keith - who is of course, is drooling for the popular, conventionally pretty girl in school. Who in turn, ignores him completely and dates the snotty rich guy in her clique, who treats her like crap. It's a love triangle. Watts plays the drums and hangs out with Keith at the shop but is too much of a tough girl - and a virgin - to make her feelings known to him. All he can obsess about is Amanda Jones the girl of his dreams. He draws her. He spends his college fund on the perfect date to woo her. There's all kinds of drama with her boyfriend deciding to set up Keith for a beating. Watts is loyal and agrees to help him out. She hates Amanda clearly, but is worried about the beating thing. I won't tell you about the rest of the plot or movie, but it's a great trip. I was always rooting for Watts, though Amanda seems less of a b*tch once you get to know her. I was kind of in love with Watts when I first saw this movie, she's the kind of people I like. I like Keith too, they're sort of underground (maybe hero) types, outcasts, arty and tough. Working class, maybe trailer trash for Watts or something. I felt sort of at home. It's a good vibe. Romantic....
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Sigh No More has such a haunting, mesmerizing sound about it. I awaited anxiously and with good reason, for the release of this album. I'm very impressed with Mumford and Sons and can't wait to see them play at Wakarusa 2011.

B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I love it, I think the casting was great wasn't sure what to make of Scott Cann but he brings the humor to the show and I love the action good remake. Not your typical detective show thank god because they are becoming boring.<br /><br />P?S : for the ladies. Alex Loughlin is hot.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This is an outstanding book - hard to put down, and once you figure out what is happening, you want to read it again.  Highly recommended.
B003EYVXTG|2.0|This film should have been less than ten minutes long. The filming and direction is good, but the plot is a smoking crater. Seventeen year old Ree is on a quest to find her father because he's used their house for collateral on a bail bond. When the bondsman shows up Ree already knows that if her father is dead then the bond will be nullified, which I did not know. That ends up being central to the story, but in a ridiculous way.     Ree's meth cooker father was snitching to police, so some of their clan have killed him. The clan folk give Ree the run-around and severely beat her. Eventually they take her to the body in a senseless scene that seems to want to be like the chipper scene from Fargo. All of this makes no sense whatsoever. It would obviously have been better for everyone if the clan had just arranged for the father's head to turn up early in the film. Everything that Ree does in searching for her father was unnecessary and pointless in light of that option. It ends essentially the same anyway, but Ree winds up in a position to name names, which would have been avoided by the other approach.     Overall, the film is just a human zoo where we get to watch a clan of hillbillies with seriously screwed up lives and marvel at the bravery of Ree on here unnecessary quest. It's seriously overrated.
B00006AW2J|5.0|Beggars Banquet may very well be the perfect album, from any group, any genera. My personal vote is Dark Side of The Moon, but how can one really choose? My point in this review is that, specifically, Jigsaw Puzzle is one of those rare, hidden, little know masterpieces. Like so many songs from the Stones, you know from the first beat, the first note, the first refrain, that you're about to hear something extraordinary. The lyrics, slide guitar, vocals, piano, and Jagger's delivery, it's not \\"Voodoo Magic\\", it's a whole new level of Music.      \\"Me I'm waiting so patiently, lying on the floor, I'm just trying to do this jigsaw puzzle before it rains anymore\\"    \\"Oh the Gangster he looks so frightening, with his Luger in his hand, but when he gets home to his children, He's a family man\\"    \\"Here comes the Bishops daughter, on the other side, and she's a trifle Jealous, she's been an outcast all her life\\"      The last two verses', about Rock and Roll and about Politics are too perfect to try and choose a single line to quote from. I don't think any better song has been written about patiently dealing with the absurdities of life.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|I purchased this memory card to replace a similar card that had been used for several years and was beginning to exhibit signs of data instability.  While xD cards may not be the 'flavor of the moment' or have gained as wide a user base as some other card types, they still are a much-needed commodity for the many users of FujiFilm and Olympus camera models.  Based on my experience with the prior card, I look forward to many years of trouble-free use.
B00006LWSF|5.0|Me and Eminem, or, Marshal Matthews are both 38. That's the only comparison I'm going to make. We've led drastically different lives. And there lies the difference. I've got plenty to be pissed off about. Most of us do. Eminem's gift, his real gift, is he can talk about life and make anybody understand.     I love how he talks about his insecurities in this song. I love how he says if you think being brilliant is easy then, well, you must be stupid. And finally, more than anything this song is an Anthem. I'm going to overcome, I'm going to beat this, I shall prevail, no matter what. Whenever I have something to accomplish or have more packed into a day than I think I can handle, I put this song on repeat, put on my Bose headphones, and go out and accomplish whatever the f*%# I have to accomplish.

1439107955|3.0|The author has done a great job in covering the history and research of cancer and he has made it an easy read. But I would be curious as to how many people actually made it all the way to the last page.  About half way thru when the focus was on DNA and RNA research I tried to keep going, but truthfully it became just too boring and I put it away.
1594202842|5.0|I think Ms. Chua is brave for publishing this book--she openly describes the good and bad (and there is a lot) of her parenting style and experience as a mother.  As many have pointed out, she is extreme and her view of the world is back and white.  But the real (heartbreaking) tragedy is her inability early on in Lulu's life to recognize the need for a different parenting strategy.  She could not get past the \\"Chinese\\" vs \\"Western\\" labels in her mind to really think about how best to parent Lulu.  When she finally comes to this realization, in a way, it is too late.  Ugh.      I agree with others that this is not a \\"how to parent\\" book.  It is a memoir that is funny, heartbreaking, and shocking.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|The only songs i really liked on this were \\"Shadow\\" and \\"Every Time.\\"  The rest are the typical pop laced with hip-hop like everything else on the radeo.  I actually think this is her worst album.
B002QEXBGS|3.0|I was a little disappointed in this production. The first worst thing I noticed was that Pluto was sung by a man who had to have his first song rewritten: the original range was perhaps beyond him, and I noticed his voice was particularly harsh, compared with a classic LP of the opera I used to have. In fact all the performers were comparatively wanting in sweetness.    Even Dessay, though versatile, strong-voiced and hard-working -- she has a lot of songs -- acted well, but without the beautiful sexy coyness that earlier operetta stars brought to the part. Her voice was strong, and didn't suffer from narrowness of range, like Pluto's, but she was never quite light and funny enough. Her voice lacked charm and her acting lacked irony.     The production got tangled up a little in its modernization. For example the cancan was not danced by the performers, in two senses: dancers were brought on when the cancan was played, and what they danced was not the cancan. Cancan in French means \\"scandal,\\" and we could hardly be scandalized by the dance itself -- women kicking up their heels and showing their legs -- when the dancers were already bare-legged, had been throughout the show, and the male dancers were cross-dressed, also from the beginning. The dancers' cancan was a series of uninspired tumbling of the female dancers over the male dancers' knees: not scandalous and barely adequate as choreography.     Stuffier old-fashioned costuming all around would have helped, since the plot is about how both Orpheus and Eurydice are in love with other people and only stay together because of the pressure of public opinion. Maybe that atmosphere is too dated to reproduce for a modern audience, but the modern substitute is inevitably a little incoherent.     I was going to show the opera to a friend as an example of Offenbach at his best, but my friend is skeptical about Offenbach and this production is too heavy to convert her. Offenbach doesn't require just good singing and acting; it requires mastery of a particular light operatic style, and that style's great masters may not be around any longer.    It was still a pleasant show for a fan like me.
B00005U152|3.0|Like many reviewers, I first saw this version as a child and even as a kid I was not impressed. It looked positively low budget compared to the Charles Laughton version (I didn't see the Lon Chaney version until many years later) and Anthony Quinn was certainly no Charles Laughton. Of course I saw it on a small black and white TV in what would have been the equivalent of pan and scan and I was unfamiliar with Anthony Quinn's celebrated appearance in Fellini's LA STRADA which he draws on heavily for his performance of Quasimodo. Now that Miramax has released this film on DVD in a 45th anniversary edition that restores the original Cinemascope ratio and with the vivid color photography intact (note the costumes against the drab Parisian sets) then it becomes a very different film and one that has surprising staying power.<br /><br />Of all the film versions that I have seen, this one comes the closest to matching Victor Hugo's book although it is not a faithful adaptation by any means. In France and Europe it is known as NOTRE DAME DE PARIS, the book's original title which tells you that the emphasis won't completely be on Quasimodo and how ugly he is but on the cathedral and other characters. Gina Lolabrigida is too old for Esmerelda but in her vivid red dress and olive complexion (she looks much more like Bizet's CARMEN) it's easy to see why men are \\"bewitched\\" by her. Quinn comes across as a mildly deformed version of Zampano the strongman which works well enough within the overall context of the film once you get past his not being as ugly as Laughton or Chaney. The acting honors go to Alain Cuny as a truly tormented Claude Frollo (not a priest but an alchemist in this version) and to Jean Tissier as a crafty Louis XI.<br /><br />The major problem with this version is that not only is the English dubbing irritating, it's downright uninspired (it was released in this country by Allied Artists who were known for their low budget movies). Gina and Anthony are fine of course, Cuny too but the rest of the cast spout banal 1950s dialogue in accents as French as the 4th of July. This frequently places the film on the level of an Italian spear and sandal epic like Steve Reeves' HERCULES. The actor dubbing Clopin is especially grating as his voice never changes its tone. I'm sure that the original French soundtrack would not only sound more natural but would draw us more into the story as well. Too bad it isn't on this DVD. Nevertheless if you've never seen this version and want something more than an ugly Quasimodo, then it is well worth seeking out especially for the powerful and effective ending. A better dubbing job or the original soundtrack would easily have earned this HUNCHBACK a 4 star rating.o but the rest of the cast spout banal 1950s dialogue in accents as French as the 4th of July.

B0042U94UQ|5.0|I love using this Seller for all my DDV's future purchases due to their price and free shipping... It allows me to buy ahead of time before the DVD comes out for sale. All I have to do is wait a few days after it comes out and I get the best price in town and on web guaranted... I would recommend this system of buying to anyone.

B00164KYV4|2.0|HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU stars Jennifer Aniston.  Ben Affleck.  Drew Barrymore.  Justin Long.  Scarlett Johansson.  Jennifer Connelly.  Kevin Connolly.  (Is that confusing, or what?)  Bradley Cooper.  Ginnifer Goodwin.  (As if we didn't have enough Jennifer/Ginnifers.)<br /><br />In other words, HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU stars every Generation Xer in Hollywood--with the exception of Ashton Kutcher.  Why Ashton lucked out, one can only wonder.<br /><br />Here we have a meandering, colossal ensemble of intertwining story lines and sub-plots--all having to do with how miserable love makes us.  What sends this film to terminal yawn status has to do with the sheer number of story lines and sub-plots; after half an hour the viewer just becomes exhausted trying to keep up with all of them.  If I had had a vote (which I didn't) I would have promptly jettisoned the Connelly-Cooper-Johansson love triangle, as none of the three characters are remotely likable.  (I heard a Wicked Witch of the West cackle every time Connelly appeared on screen; can we say the word \\"severe\\"?)  The most interesting story line centers around Goodwin's hard luck character falling for Long's character--who views their relationship as purely platonic.  Or does he?  Or do we really care?<br /><br />Don't answer that.<br /><br />Legions of actors--bushels of story lines.  Best take notes, or keep a score card, if you can even get into HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
1594202842|5.0|Any mom who is proud of whatever way she parented can identify with Amy Chua....  AND any mom who regrets or is even ashamed of certain parenting tactics will be able to identify with this mother as well.  Any mom who can acknowledge that over the course of her parenting she fell into BOTH of these categories at different times and in different realms, will probably appreciate this book even more. Any mom who finds herself looking back trying to justify and defend her own parenting approach (whatever style it may have been), may wince as she sees herself in this book. This book is for moms that have been too driven as well as for moms that have been too lax... and even those in between. Mothers who can be honest with themselves and acknowledge their own parenting flaws will be the most likely to suspend judgment and be drawn into this candid memoir of one mother's very intense journey.           Even though I did not parent with such intensity and drive, I finished the book wishing Amy Chua was in my circle of friends.  In many (though not all) ways I wish I was more like her.  I applaud her dedication and her work ethic.  I admire her willingness to reflect and to make changes. I understand her pride and appreciate her humility. I learned a lot about myself by reading this book. I also learned a lot about parenting, philosophy, culture differences, and sharing a vision for raising great kids... We are all on a journey as mothers, no matter what style of parenting we adopt. My advice: Don't let the media or anyone else (including me!) tell you what you should think about this book... READ IT!
0061564893|4.0|It is amazing what the Chinese were able to accomplish.  It ties into other history I only had heard about.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting to 'think out of the box'.
0375826742|5.0|I love, love, love these books. They are written so that any age group can enjoy them. They have such vivid imagery and keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. I would reccomend these books to anybody with an imagination and likes to read. This is a fantasy book with lots of mythical creatures and characters you will fall in love with.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I was amazed at how well this author was able to write from a 5-year olds perspective.  Anyone who has children of their own or works with kids would fall in love with the mother and son in this book.  The way the mother creatively organized her days locked in this room to further her son's development is amazing.  It's the type of book you'll continue to think back to days after you've finished reading.  It's a must read!
B002AKPECW|5.0|I was looking for a new book after finishing all the Peter F. Hamilton books a while back and came across this one.  I read the reviews and decided to give it a try.  While it was totally different than the PFH books, it is a great book.  I am so very picky about endings, and have endured and been \\"satisfied\\" with average many times, but this really was one of the best endings I've read in a while.  Very nice touch.  Since then I've read a few more of his earlier books, but really - this book was much better than all of those in my opinion.  Great read, and worth the money.
B002N3GD2Q|4.0|When I first listened to the CD of The Doors live at the Felt Forum, New York City 1970 I was dumbfounded by the clarity of the soundboard recording and more so by the Doors feral performance. This was in 1989 and the box set was imported from Europe and included many photos both in B/W and Color of those Felt Forum Concerts. It also included  Jim Morrison quotes from those performances. So it is quite enlightening to have a chance to listen to a clearer version of the same recordings 21 years later with more liner notes and the sonic clarity that only Bruce Botnik, original Doors engineer, could personally accomplish. These live Doors recordings include the bands effort to capture their early 1966-1967 club day intimacy. Songs like Peace Frog, Soul Kitchen, Who Do You Love, Moonlight drive, Light my Fire, Maggie M'Gill, are easy standouts not because of their familiarity but because the band attempts and succeeds a looser, more jazzier approach to their arrangements without compromising the ferocity of the performance. The music sounds fresher than previous Door concert recordings like Live in Houston (1968) or Live at Madison Square Garden (1969). True, the band knew they were recording these Felt Forum concerts but they were also not showboating or posturing because you can't fake the funk on a live audio recording.     I suggest anyone interested in the Doors music try and give Live at the Felt Forum a listen. It is an amazing recording that should have been released not in 1989 or 1979 but when it was originally recorded. This box set is the missing link that \\"Absolutely Live\\" was not absolute about!
B002JH3TW8|5.0|This product performed as specified.  I recently upgraded to a 13\\" Mac Book Pro and needed a way to connect older Firewire 400 devices.  Some of the devices I have connected so far include:  2nd generation iPod (click-wheel), Cannon Elura 100 video camera, and a Lacie 250 GB removable hard drive.  Each of these devices performed just as it had when used on an older Mac with the older 400 port.  Would highly recommend this product!
1594202842|1.0|The author attributes her cruelty & disturbing personality to being a Chinese. I hope that is not true.   She must have been abused like this in her childhood but has received good educations and somehow has a successful career. Now does that mean she can justify child abuse? Of course not. I hope her daughters realize that their mom didn't them do any good and they shouldn't do this to their future kids. Jeez, this is one horror story of strange, sick family that needs help.
1599218011|5.0|I am not on a diet, nor have I been, but I really wanted to read and review this book for since it offered more than just your vegan recipes, but a REAL lifestyle change! Who doesn't want to be healthy for life?!  The author breaks the book down in a manner that is plain fun to read and understand, like she's really talking to you directly, not just rattling off facts! By the time you've read the first 9 chapters (which you will easily breeze through wanting to mark pages as you go)you are all set for chapter 10, \\"Let the Adventure Cleanse Begin\\". I love how the author also shows you what your typical food eating week may look like while on this cleanse, and she even breaks down every day (21 days) with affirmations, tips, prayers, focus, and God pod maintenance (once you read the book, it all becomes clear). I just know for myself that once I am finished with this cleanse, I will feel and be a better person both inside and out! Finally, in the back of the book, the author gives a few \\"crazy sexy recipes\\", like her green guru smoothie, which sounds totally gross at first, but once you've made it, it's awesome! As well as those sexy seed cakes and the Mexican pilaf....I could go on and on, but you get the picture! BUY the book, it's worth it for vegans and non-vegans alike!
030746363X|5.0|This book is so much fun to read!  I wouldn't expect most people to actually do all the things the author suggests (although I'm trying to do a lot of it and loving the results), but what a great way to get ideas for how to live a healthier life!  Plus, the book is written so well that whether you decide to follow his ways or not, his ideas are super interesting and his writing will make you laugh.  I have gotten through the first 250 pages in just a few days...it's hard to put down!
B004LRZ2YC|5.0|What has always been the scariest element of vampire movies was the inability to resist. Even scarier is entwining love with that irresistibility. This movie has that but instead of evoking fear, now that I'm fairly old, it brings a deep sadness. In addition, a question formed in my mind: Who was really most evil in this movie?
B002JVWRAY|3.0|...the season ender was a HUGE letdown. The entire season was building up to a climactic battle between the archangel Michael and his banished little brother who happens to be Lucifer the lord of all thats evil in the world; but when it came time for the big showdown, what should have been a battle of cosmic proportions complete with fire, brimstone, and hell on earth destruction is substituted with a mild argument between two brothers who will never see eye to eye on things! I guess thats all what the showrunners could come up with given only a TV budget to work with. If only this were turned into a feature film with a million -dollar budget, the ending that should've been would definitely have made the entire season worth it. Other than the ending, the rest of the season is superb television at its best.  Happy Hunting!
B0034JKZ86|1.0|The movie invokes voodoo, demons etc.  If you care about what your children see I would not recommend this movie at all.  We threw away the movie into the trash.

Yup. I ain't kiddin' ya.
B002GJT4YQ|5.0|This is really an ultimate edition. Great number of bonuses, movie quality, already on bluray, digital copy included, pictures, book, cards, a must-have for every potterish.
B0039TAHMA|1.0|I was very disappointed with the film for the following reasons: 1) It was very confusing as scenes chopped from one to the next with no connection or continuity; 2) poor to no character development; 3) overemphasis on extravagant make-up, costumes and computer generated images, and underemphasis on basic acting skills to deliver a good story; 4) Gallum would have been much more enjoyable if played by a human. The computer generated image was just awful. In short, a great story that was destroyed by this film. Thank goodness I read the book before I saw this movie. I turned it off about a quarter in due to boredom.
B000BNI90O|5.0|I had purchased the normal Lord of the Rings movie soundtracks before I purchased the Complete Recordings and the Complete Recordings are the way to go! I feel like I'm watching the movie every time I listen to the Complete Recordings. It's seamless and the tracks flows perfectly from one to the next. You get the entire score on these disks--unlike the chopped up normal Lord of the Rings soundtracks. All of the songs the characters sing in the movies are included in the Complete Recordings as well (this is not true for the normal Lord of the Rings soundtracks). Cash in the extra money and buy the Complete Recordings versions.<br /><br />Regarding the score itself, Howard Shore's songs are brilliantly written! His music motifs for each character, theme, location, etc are beautifully interwoven throughout the entire score. I don't even really know what to say because this score is so gorgeous, dynamic, and inspirational that to understand how beautiful it is you just have to listen to it.<br /><br />I've listened to MANY scores for movies including (but definitely not limited to) scores composed by Hans Zimmer, John Williams, Klaus Badelt, James Horner, James Newton Howard, Thomas Newman, John Debney, Harry Gregson-Willaims, and Alan Silvestri. Yet this specific score (well, the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy score) is one of the most profound scores I know.<br /><br />I'm in love with this score to say the least. I've even cried when I've listen to a few songs b/c I can picture the movie as I listen to it and it just moves me so much =) Definitely buy this.
1401307957|5.0|I found this book to be a great read and a great help. If you have an artist block this book will set you free. I was having trouble with blank pages and getting started until I read Danny Gregory's book. It is unlike the typical art instruction book. He really does make everyday matter.

B0025UHKNS|5.0|I received this watch as a present and absolutely love it! I have been actively running for about 2 years and prior to this watch used a website to map my runs and the Nike iPod chip to monitor my distances and calories burned. This is much more accurate and saves me from mapping my courses prior to running. While I have not taken the time to familiarize myself with all the things this watch can do I have been very pleased with what I have discovered.     One of the things I like best is the size of the watch. I have small wrists and the size of this watch is perfect for me. I like how it came with an extra band so if I want to change it out to a more comfortable one I can.     Many reviews I read about this watch discussed the problems with the touch bezel. I have not had any problems with it because I lock it when I run. Locking it keeps the screen from changing during my runs (I also set the scroll to lock).     The only problem I have experienced with this watch was trying to set it up on my computer. Once I moved away from the other computer in the house and my cell phone it was easily accomplished. I like how it automatically uploads my data when I turn on my computer.     This watch is very user friendly and perfect for anyone.
0374531269|4.0|This book will probably make you cry. It was heartbreaking to read about the horrors of war Ishmael and others like him had to deal with at such a young age. He recounts his experiences in vivid detail and makes you feel like you are there with him. The most interesting part to me was the honesty with which he talks about the mental transformation he underwent as he became a young soldier (committing atrocities himself), and the difficulty he had re-adjusting to normal life when this new-found identity was taken away. If you think you have problems, reading this book will put them firmly into perspective and make you think twice before complaining about anything ever again.
B003V5PPZG|5.0|Thing is good. When it arrived at my home I was little surprise. I thought it would arrived about after 10 days.
B001AEF6D6|1.0|I love Coen Brothers movies. Every one I've seen is near the top of my list of all-time favorites. For years my friends said to see \\"Lebowski\\" and I finally did. I have rarely sat through such a boring, pointless, humorless piece of junk. (It's sad that all the obsessed fanboys who sit on here are going to immediately give me thumbs-down reviews because they have nothing better to do than sit on Amazon defending their precious cult favorite).     I'm not a child (32) and I have no problem at all with sex, drugs or cursing in movies. I like comedies...FUNNY ones. This movie does not have the slice-of-life hilarity of \\"Fargo\\" or of Javier Bardem's mushroom-haired killed in \\"No Country\\". This is Will Ferrel humor, especially the idiotic Jesus character...come on, haven't we had enough of ironically-\\"funny\\"-take-their-lives-too-seriously Ben Stiller/Steve Carrel characters? (Yes, I know this is an older movie than those actors' heydays.)    I just really couldn't stand it. I hope my one-star helps build up the body of negative reviews on Amazon to possibly dissuade people from wasting money on this junk.
B002ZG976U|4.0|When I originally saw this in theaters, I thought it was pretty good, but okay material. One of those fun chick movies. My husband didn't mind the little love story on the side at all, which he normally has a problem with when watching these movies. He thought it was pretty great- this from a man who hates musicals like Chicago! I did enjoy the flash and outside of what has been said, the acting was pretty damn good. The musical numbers are songs I recognize and I enjoy what they did with them.     I was bothered by all the bad reviews on this film. I didn't think it deserved it at all and this is one of the few movies I'll be buying this year. First film I enjoyed since Inception.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|Rather than reviewing the movie, this is a comment on the blu-ray itself.  The disc is a great value, the transfer from film to disc is incredible and the special effects and soundtrack really pop.  The blu ray is definitely worth it for this movie...don't waste time on the DVD version if you have a blu ray player.
B0013FSL0C|1.0|Oh my god, I cannot express how disappointed I am. The show was not good to begin with, but I expected at least in the end one steamy sex scene. It was on HBO, for god's sake. But instead, what we got, was an awful sanctimonious moralistic tale that seems to be straight out of bible. What in the word is wrong with you people? By whom I mean the writers. I hate you -- you wasted nearly 15 hours of my life. Blue balls. In the worst of ways. I hate you. I want to cry.     Do not watch this if you do not want to be preached to about morals and pseudo-psychology. There was no reason for the ending to be this way. In reality, it would not happen this way -- EVER. But in the end, the therapist turns out to be a spineless, disgusting human being who has no balls whatsoever. I hate hate hate the ending. I will not watch this or anything by anyone associated with this show and will tell everyone how awful and patronizing it is. What the hell? I cannot believe they actually want you to be like, \\"yeah, Gina is right, he's such a good guy. He's a moral person.\\"     I mean, I understand they would not have lasted, okay, I am not a child, but at LEAST one kiss/decent bra shot. Right? I know I'm not the only person who feels this way -- you screwed the pooch, HBO.
B003R0MF1C|5.0|This is a very good season and I think the show ended on a high note. This show allows you to know your charaters and they never switch actors, with the exception of Lucky (but I think we all liked the change. Although the orginal Lucky was very good.) I enjoy having the DVDs because I can watch them over and over again. I you want something that will never leave with the regret of buying it, this is the series. I may step away for a month or so but I always come back. This show is full of morals and takes many twists and turns never leaving you suprised.
B002ZG993Q|2.0|There were two things wrong with the movie. The first was that Clooney's character carried what I believe was a Walthe PPK (James Bond's gun), which is a small-caliber handgun. With it he shot two professional assassins with rifles who had set up to take him out -- laughably impossible. Perhaops a minor quibble, but isn't it time that movie makers get guns right? The second problem I had was with the movie's ending (SPOILER ALERT!!!) Although we ca't be sure whether or not he lives after passing out, didn't you hunger for a heroic ending where he triumphs and gets away with his beautiful girl friend? It seems that Hollywood isn't comfortable with male heroes any more -- female ones are OK -- but men simply cannot be heroic any more. I see this as part of the feminine mystique ideology that has slowly permeated contemporary life, including films and television. When men do heroic things in movies these days, the films are often cartoonish. For heroism, think of Aragorn' speech to the Men of the West at the Battle of the Gate (LOTR -- ROTK) or the Viking prayer in the last battle of The 13th Warrior.
B003UESJHE|5.0|I throughouly enjoyed The King's Speech as will many many others. I am twenty and really enjoyed it so I think it appeals to many different ages and groups of people. Colin Firth was, as always, an absolute treat to watch behind camera. He always gives soo much into his roles and delivers himself so well just like in [[ASIN:B002VECLVY A Single Man [Blu-ray]]]. He has without a doubt become one of my favorite actors! The other characters, Geoffrey Rush and Helena Carter are both absolutely wonderful to see as well in the movie, bringing most of the humor into the film. I will be buying this when it comes out and will watch mutiple times Im sure. Anyone who likes history will love it as well! Go see it before it is outta theaters..
B004IM14RY|5.0|I thought this was going to be about some f'ed up kids who commit a horrible crime, but there was so much more. Kept me interested the entire time and I really felt I was there too.  Kudos to Ryan Reynolds for keeping us involved while we watched him in a box for an hour and a half.
1400031524|3.0|After thoroughly enjoying Henning Mankell's first book, Faceless Killers, I was looking forward to reading his second book, The Dogs of Riga.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  As long as the action takes place in Sweden, the story is entertaining and believable.  However, when the action shifts to Riga, believability disappears, and I was as bewildered as Swedish detective Kurt Wallander, who is summoned to Riga to investigate the murder of a Lithuanian detective who had assisted Wallander when two bodies wash ashore in Sweden.      These murder victims are identified as Lithuanians, but Riga is the capital of Latvia, not Lithuania.  The Riga plot is based on real events that took place in Lithuania, so the action should take place in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania.  I don't know if the error is the author's or the translator's, but it annoyed and distracted me.      The bloody violence at the end of the book is jarring, and the freedom fighter subplot seems contrived.  I hope Kurt Wallander remains in Sweden in subsequent books.  Mankell makes his native country come alive, but he is not very successful at doing this with unfamiliar foreign territory.  If Wallander weren't such a likeable character, I might have shelved The Dogs of Riga when the story moved across the Baltic Sea.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|Haven't seen a movie this good in several years. It's refreshing to see a movie that is so well-acted and so well-made amidst all the hi-tech garbage that is coming out of hollywood these days. If you're a casualty of our ADHD culture and need high & constant stimulation, you might not like this film.
B0009VRHLK|4.0|This one ain't for everybody.  It takes patience to view, and trust that Vincent Gallo won't let you down.  He doesn't.  The ending surprises, the in-between challenges and intrigues the viewer, and there is an overall theme of tenderness that was a very pleasant surprise.  AND LASTLY, I am thankful for it- it's not some self-absorbed indie flick nor some piece of shiny, plastic Hollywood studio crap.  Yes, I know it's a movie, but it's effect was to feel very real - and ain't that \\"movie magic\\"?
1439163146|1.0|I had the experience (I had originally typed \\"pleasure\\" but I realize that would be dishonest of me) of reading Franco's \\"Into the Black\\" (re-named \\"Jack-O\\" for the book) in Esquire during my final year as an undergraduate creative writing major. Reading that story, knowing it had been published in such an esteemed magazine by an unknown writer, was like being punched in the face by someone wearing a large high school ring on each finger who had recently completely his lavatory hygiene with that same fist.    The \\"black gaping gap\\" line is missing from the book, however the prose maintains the choppy, voiceless, faux-80's-minimalism of that piece throughout. I recommend to anyone considering a purchase: go online, read \\"Into the Black.\\" If you love it then hey, good for you, James has a fan. If not, don't bother, unless you are like me and feel the need to masochistically go through it all with a red pen.    Franco is a fine writer if your standards are \\"Creative Writing Intermediate Class.\\" These stories would not have wowed me in an advanced or master class and they certainly do not merit publishing. It is an insult to writing students everywhere to see this in print, especially lauded by Amy Hempel and Mona Simpson (those endorsements almost made me cry). It is clear that if, like the rest of us, Franco had taken a four-year program, he could emerge as a decent writer. However his experience is slapdash and copycat and it shows. I have read far, far better stories by my peers and it is beyond frustrating knowing how hard they will have to work to ever see their work as exposed as Franco's. I cannot believe that Yale has accepted him as an English PhD student.     On a side note, a friend pointed out that Franco's name is the same size as the title on the front cover, and we all had a good laugh.
1595478728|4.0|I recently read back-to-back [[ASIN:0268035040 MacIntyre's After Virtue]] and Chesterton's Orthodoxy.  Although I've been meaning to read these both for over a decade, I decided to do it now and together as I had conceived a project to read them together with Julius Evola's Revolt Against the Modern World as three views of anti-modernism: MacIntyre as a reformed modernist, Evola as a radical reactionary, and Chesterton as a defender of the status quo of the old order.  This project didn't quite work out as MacIntyre and Chesterton turned out not to be quite what I thought.  Although it's true that MacIntyre made the trip from Marxism to classicism and Catholicism, After Virtue is less an attempt to disabuse us of Marxism than an attempt to re-ground a form of corporatism in a pre-modern mode that would not be subject to the devastating critiques presented by advocates of modern liberal capitalism.  And although it's also true that Chesterton defends orthodox Roman Catholicism, he makes no attempt to defend the status quo per se and, in fact, embraces Catholicisim as a stable ground from which he can ask for the dissolution of the traditional social structure.  As against these two, Evola is quite another type as he has no interest in ethics' relationship to the distribution of goods; his is an otherworldly and inegalitarian philosophy.<br /><br />In a most general way, MacIntyre argues that reason has been shown incapable of providing a basis for ethics since reasoning requires some starting point outside itself.  For MacIntyre, this starting point is our mutual social life and experience of society.<br /><br />Interestingly, Chesterton goes part way toward some of the same analyses as MacIntyre.  Both After Virtue and Orthodoxy start from the assumption of the failure of pure reason.  For MacIntyre, this is due to a lack of ends, while for Chesterton it is due to a lack of mysticism (Chesterton's word for unexamined assumptions about reality).  Reasoning without pre-conditions is shown to be (a) incomplete and incoherent and (b) unhealthy and counterproductive.  Chesterton then goes on to examine a number of ethical systems that all fail in one way or another for a lack standards.  He brings in the classical-Catholic view of virtues here and argues that some modes of ethics fail for lacking the proportionality of the virtues.  Nietzsche fails for being unable to distinguish between willing the good of being a prince and that of a pauper.  If these arguments seem unreasonable and based in socially constructed standards, it must be remembered that Chesterton has already dismissed pure reason without a ground of assumptions.<br /><br />Having dismissed modern rationalist theories, Chesterton goes on to explain the assumptions from which he reasons, that is, his own personal mysticism so to speak.  Chesterton's mysticism is a conglomeration of principles such as the assumption of design in beauty, a bias in favor of optimism against pessism, and a desire for social reform.  He is quite straightforward in admitting that he developed these assumptions in childhood and makes no attempt to defend them.  He is, at least, an introspective thinker who has probably more honesty about himself than most thinkers.  Chesterton's argument for Christian orthodoxy, then, is essentially that orthodoxy is the philosophy most at home in Chesterton's world of assumptions.  This is not a good argument for why you should be orthodox, but it is a perfectly acceptable account for why Chesterton is, and this is all he claimed to be doing in his book.<br /><br />Is it a good or relevant book for us?  I think Chesterton assumes that his assumptions are very similar to our own, although I'm not sure that's true in our time and place.  Beyond this, although I have sketched a very broad outline of Chesterton's theme or point, his book is filled with a multidude of tiny arguments upon which his theme relies, and I'm not sure they are all good.  For example, in discussing Carlyle, he confuses Christianity's attitude toward the state of the soul with a doctrinal assumption that he who least wants to rule ought to be chosen as the ruler.  This may be a good guide for choosing a Pope, but it is simply an empirical question whether it is a good guide for choosing a king or a member of parliament.  On this point, orthodoxy does not support his levelling political instinct.  This is one example, but the book is filled with questionable assumptions and questionable conclusions.  Chesterton even at times argues against himself, taking two opposite views at different places in order to score rhetorical points.<br /><br />Orthodoxy is not in any way an argument for orthodoxy in the way we have come to expect arguments.  However, Chesterton is not an unreasonable or unpleasant person, and it's possible that one could find the totality of his worldview overwhelming even while rejecting its specifics.  His writing is inconsistent and trends from being poetic and insightful to being boorish and repetitive.  Whether or not you get much out it depends on what you bring to it, I think.<br /><br />This edition/printing of the book is cheap and looks okay on the outside, but the font and page layout make it difficult to read.  I would choose another printing if I were to start over again.s Christianity's attitude toward the state of the soul with a doctrinal assumption that he who least wants to rule ought to be chosen as the ruler.

B004HWR406|5.0|I would first like to state that few people in history become a legend because they sought to do so. This film is not accurate on a few levels as stated by Mr. Zuckerberg himself, but it does have many offerings for history classes into the future of mankind. I found the movie entertaining and very easy to watch. The people that will find this movie the most valuable to see are those that find Facebook a part of their lives. I would say the movie is Kewl and Mark said he thinks it's \\"interesting\\". There is a funny video about Mark and SNL after Mark saw the movie. Go watch that clip and see the 60 minutes interview with Mark too. Those will enrich your enjoyment of this movie greatly. I think the best part about Mark's story is, he has so much more history to write for us. Bill Gates is in the Twilight of his life and Mark Zuckerberg is in the Dawn. Stay tuned for the sequel ! Facebook is worth 50 Billion Dollars US as of today.
B0041KKYEM|3.0|On the surface, Black Swan is the story of a ballet dancer (Natalie Portman) who chances to get her name in lights dancing the lead part in Tchaikovsky's ballet version of the fairy tale Swan Lake.  Swan Lake tells the story of a princess, Odette, who is trapped in the body of a swan by the spell of an evil sorcerer.  Odette meets a prince who falls in love with her and promises to break the spell by marrying her, but the sorcerer's daughter, Odile, impersonates Odette and tricks the prince, leaving Odette permanently under the sorcerer's spell.  In the end, Odette and the prince commit suicide together.  Traditionally, the parts of Odette and Odile are danced by the same ballerina, requiring a dancer to master two parts for the performance.  In the film, Portman is a technically proficient dancer who can easily master the part of virtuous Odette but has trouble portraying the sensual and seductive part of Odile.  Portman leads a boring life sharing an apartment with her mother.  The ballet's director (Vincent Cassel) encourages Portman to explore her passionate side to learn how to dance Odile and threatens to replace her in the lead by her understudy (Mila Kunis).  Struggling to find her inner Odile, Portman has psychological difficulties including dreams and visions, an erotic interlude with the help of Kunis, and finally finds the key to dancing Odile when she finds the strength to murder Kunis.<br /><br />There's so much going on in Black Swan that it's like writer/director Aronofsky had a schizophrenic break and pulled together names, themes, and plot elements from all sorts of things in the history of film and pop culture.  Take just the name \\"Black Swan.\\"  Although having meaning within Tchaikovsky's ballet Swan Lake, the term is also used to mean something very rare and has entered pop culture through Nassim Taleb's book of the same name.  Is it a coincidence that, according to this film, while there are many dancers who can master the part of Odette, the dancer who can master Odette and Odile is a rare bird indeed?  Or consider the parallels with the Sith of Star Wars.  Cassel replaces his former prima ballerina with Portman and threatens Portman with replacement by Kunis.  Like the Emperor, Darth Vader, and Luke Skywalker, there can be only one master (or director) and one apprentice (or prima ballerina) and Cassel encourages Portman to prove her worth and release her true power (i.e., dancing ability) by exploring the Dark Side.  Is it a coincidence that Portman appears in this part after playing Darth Vader's love interest in the Star Wars prequels?<br /><br />Or consider the term \\"red shoe.\\"  While many other reviewers have noted similarities between Black Swan and the 1948 ballet film called The Red Shoes, most people today are probably more familiar \\"red shoe\\" from the Showtime series Red Shoe Diaries, a series of erotic dramas that explore burgeoning female sexuality.  In this series, David Duchovny plays the former boyfriend of a dead woman who began cheating on him after being sold a pair of red shoes.  This odd plot device seems likely to have been inspired by the same Hans Christian Anderson story that inspired the 1948 film.  Is it a coincidence that Black Swan contains a strong erotic element that could have been swiped from an episode of Red Shoe Diaries?  Or is it a coincidence that a 2005 Korean horror film by the same name portrays a mother-daughter pair who live together in an apartment and involves dreams and visions?<br /><br />Like Odette, Odile, and the Prince in Swan Lake, Portman and Kunis essentially compete for the favor of Cassel in Black Swan.  Cassel's character is named LeRoy (\\"the king\\"), while Portman's character is named Nina, a diminutive form of the name Ann, which in Hebrew means \\"He chose me\\" (Portman literally repeats this exact phrase when Cassel makes her his prima).  Kunis' character is named Lily, which is diminutive of Lilith, a type of mythological Hebrew succubus that takes the form of a bird, although a screetch owl rather than a swan...  All coincidence or intentional connect the dots?  One could go on in this vein.<br /><br />So is there something more to all this, or is it just Aronofsky free association?  Swan Lake, composed in 19th century Russia, is an essentially moralistic tragedy that pits spontaneous virtuous love against plotting and dissembling.  The lovers can only find completion in heaven and are objectively separated from evil.  Black Swan was not composed in 19th century Russia but 21st century America.  As such, the film is not a moralistic tragedy but a therapeutic tragedy, and the protagonist does not find completion in separation from evil but by the exploration and integration of her Id.  Portman's childish life of pink sheets and music boxes is controlled by her mother and she must break out of it (i.e., kill her mother) if she is to be able to effectively dance the part of Odile for Cassel (i.e., marry her father).  The tragedy is that Portman has lived too long in the world of children and does not know how to explore her Id.  For Aronofsky, Odette and Odile are not two separate characters in a medieval Morality Play, but two halves of the psyche that have to be integrated in order for Portman to enter adulthood.  Tragically Portman is unable to manage the integration and is eventually consumed by the spirit of Odile, who encourages her to murder Kunis.  And just as in Mozart's The Magic Flute (another story involving bird-people), in which the evil sorcerer turns out to be benevolent and appearances are turned on their head, we see in the end of Black Swan that Cassel has really cared about Portman all along and his machinations have indeed been to help her fulfill her potential.  For in Aronofsky's story, the parts of the Evil Sorcerer and the Prince are mixed and divided.  Although Cassel with his harem of women trapped as ballet dancers appears to parallel Swan Lake's Evil Sorcerer with his harem of women trapped in the bodies of swans, we find that he is also the Prince and that it is Portman's mother who wishes to keep her trapped, like Mozart's Queen of the Night.<br /><br />Is this all too much?  As movie critic Steve Sailor has pointed out, on many levels Black Swan is a counterpoint to Aronofsky's previous film The Wrestler: \\"masculine v. feminine, experience v. innocence, heavy v. light, weightlifting v. bulimia, vulgar v. aristocratic...\\"  However, Sailor leaves out one particularly important dichotomy, which is how we deal with the entrances and exits to our adulthood, seen as the period of our prime productivity or artistic accomplishment.  While The Wrestler focuses on a washed up aging performer leaving adulthood and features Rourke and Tomei, two washed up actors, Black Swan focuses on a faltering talent struggling to enter adulthood.  And likewise Portman is the actress we have been waiting for, for years.  Since getting kudos in The Professional and going to Harvard, Natalie Portman has been the perpetual next big thing.  She may win an Oscar for this performance, but it's not clear to me why.  I think there's another Hans Christian Anderson story that applies here.<br /><br />Is it a good film?  I had to think about it for a while.  At first I was angry because the horror and erotica genre hat-tips left me feeling like I had been scammed.  But after reading other reviews that praised the dancing in the film when there was virtually no dancing shown, I wanted to give it another shot and re-thought the whole thing.  Aronofsky seems like addled director but not one without talent.  Ultimately, this is a film that deserves 2 viewings and then to be forgotten.though a screetch owl rather than a swan...

B00002E224|1.0|I love Ethan Hawke. I read good reviews about this movie and saw it listed in the top 20 romantic movies (somewhere...). I recorded it to watch on my wedding anniversary-we didn't end up watching. I am so glad we didn't! I finally found time to watch it and ended up fast forwarding through great portions of their 'deep conversations'. I agree with others that it was pretentious, but above all, completely unbelievable. I would hope that my daughter would never make such a mistake. I just can't imagine Delpy would really agree to get off the train with Hawke. He was totally creepy, imo. He was annoying, flippant and sarcastic (he also looked completely untrustworthy). Viewers just don't know enough (or anything, for that matter) about Hawke's character's life to make him likable. I am so sad, truly I am, to advise everyone to avoid this movie. I have seen advertisements with better acting.
0307266303|5.0|My husband is ill and does a lot of reading.  He doesn't care for fiction so I try to get history books or biographies or autobiography books.  He really enjoyed this book.  Thumbs up!!
B000VUFJ4Q|5.0|This album is amazing! Well worth the price and a must have for everyone! Every track on the album is made with perfection and at such a young age! Taylor is definately THE best country artist to date. Its just a shame that being in the UK that half her music wasn't heard until 2 years after the debut album and 1 year after the deluxe.    Overall a 10/10 for this product
B004LRZ2YC|4.0|This movie was a very \\"dark\\" take on a really interesting story. Sure, the kids wrap you around their fingers so to speak. Owen...OMG - LOVE HIM!! His story will melt your heart!! Abby, on the other hand...for being what she is,...is really a hero. Talk about mental turmoil. My best part about this movie?...(quite unexpected from my end mind you)...was when the Blue Oyster Cult \\"I'm Burning\\" song came on. I kinda freaked myself a bit, because, as gruesome as the scene was,...like a silly, I was completely wrapped up by the impeccable song choice - JAMMING!!...PERFECT song, perfect movie to match it to...I am glad that I saw this movie. It was very touching & meaningful in a very dark way...leaves something left on your \\"palate\\" when trying to figure out how far back this story REALLY began, or, how much further this story really will live on. I'd say - watch it.
1599219751|5.0|I enjoyed this book better than any I have ever read.  I felt that I was walking with them, sharing their hardships and heartaches.  No one knows how strong they are until they are put to the test and they all passed with flying colors.  The book was written like a conversation and it captured my attention from the first word.
B0036TGSIK|1.0|Easy A tries to be another Clueless but turns into a pile of garbage. The script is both bad and offensive. The acting is absolutely dreadful from top to bottom. I deeply regret renting this movie and more deeply regret letting two 14-year-old girls watch it unattended during a dinner party.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I absolutely love this show and feel that it doesn't matter if you're a man or woman. It's an amazing show with a well thought out story line, and yeah because it's on starz it's more explicit than regular tv which I feel has gotten boring and over censored in the past few years. It offers action and romance and maybe a hint of mystery at not knowing whether or not things will go how you expect.
0060531053|5.0|This is an excellent book on the basics (plus) of home brewing beer.  The explanations are clear and the introduction of technical terms is very gentle.  You really can read this as a novice and make a decent first batch.  The author is very good at pointing out the parts of the process that really need to be followed, as well as the parts where you can \\"make your own call\\".    I highly recommend this for anyone that wants to try brewing their own beer and have fun doing it.  So, \\"relax and have a home brew\\".
0446693804|5.0|I saw the movie prior to reading the book and felt like I was able to know the characters more in the movie.  It just didn't seem like the characters were well-described, however the overall story was a sweet one, sad, but with a thought provoking finish. It was a fairly quick and easy read.  Enjoy!
B000OCBPLC|5.0|I got this album when it first came out back in 1981 and I still love it. It's a great album start to finish.
B001KVZ6F2|4.0|I enjoy Clint Eastwood as both an actor and a director, and i was personally pleased with his film. The co-stars were definitely not as great, but Clint makes up for that. I also really liked the plot, and the roles of all the actors. The whole movie came together well, Clint's racy comments are both funny and somewhat predictable, but none the less awesome. There is even some good action scenes in the film. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good movie, or the big movie buff.
B0000639IJ|4.0|The movie was chaotic, but also highly informative educative experience about the life of Ali. Since, I grew up after the Fight with Frazier and the fight with Foreman in Zaire, I found this part informative. I was a huge Ali fan. How could you not be, he was all over the TV, all of 3 channels at the time. And I saw him fight Spinks and Holmes, towards the end of his career. I did not know that he had been named by the Nation of Islam, and he did not make up the name Mahammad Ali.<br />  Who was Jamie Foxx trying to play in the movie? He wore a Jewish star, stated he was Jewish, but didn't seem to do anything? The movie tried to cover everything about Ali's life, that would take several movies I think, because his life was massive, they did a good attempt to show a small piece of it, however chaotic and veering on not making any sense.<br />  Cosell, played by Jon Voight, I thought was an excellent acting job and was quite impressed, but not perfect, yet must be hard to pull off. Talking about hard to pull off, Will Smith portrayal of Ali was a valiant effort of what must be a difficult part to play. Never mind, that Smith was about 1/2 the size of Ali, and did not mimic Ali perfectly, but anyhow who could.
B0034G4P7G|3.0|This was an interesting movie to see how Facebook was born, but I didn't love it. At times, you can't even hear what they are saying because the music is too loud. Jesse Eisenberg stars as Mark Zuckerberg, the inventor of Facebook. It starts with him creating it, and brought to a later time when he is being sued because the Winklevoss brothers claim he stole their idea. If you want to witness the birth of Facebook, you may enjoy THE SOCIAL NETWORK!!!
B004LRZ2YC|5.0|A dark, deep love story, not to be missed!!! I have to admit I can watch this over and over again and it continues to hit my sensitive side repeatedly. Although slightly different from the Swedish original, the main ideas of the story are intact and the changes seem to tighten up this remake.
0545123275|2.0|I finally finished this book - a love story between a young girl and a boy who spends his winters as a wolf - and I actually wish I hadn't bothered.  There were many times that I wanted to just put it away for good but, instead, kept reading in hopes of a big payout.  It never came.    As a found both the plot and the characters cloying, the book was a struggle to get through.  There was very little in the story to engage me on any level above the surface, which is why I never really felt compelled to finish.  Add to that the fact that the pacing of the book was painfully slow and it was without a doubt a tough read.  That said, however slow the pacing was (did the author really need to devote the bulk of the book to Grace being dropped off and picked up from school?); I would have appreciated at least a little bit of back story to indicate why the main characters, Sam and Grace, shared such an intense connection (as it was portrayed by the author).  Their \\"insta-love\\" was not just unbelievable, but I found that it actually detracted from the story.  I couldn't figure out why they liked each other, let alone shared an unbreakable bond (aside from staring at each other in the woods for several years, their human interactions were limited to making out even mid-way through the story).  Rather than finding out about each other or exploring who they were as individuals or even a couple, they just suddenly began expressing their undying love for one another.  It was hard to believe at best; trite at worst.    Notwithstanding the obvious connections to the Twilight series (which is not why I read it; I was taken in by the beautiful cover art); the story still seemed to be one that's been told a million times.  And perhaps it has.  The real fault in the novel, however, was that the author felt compelled to constantly introduce plot points only to leave them hanging for the bulk of the book (although Stiefvater takes the cake for going one step further than some authors byintroducing characters who are completely irrelevant; I mean who is Rachael anyway?).  This was perhaps the most frustrating part of this book.  Not only was it poorly plotted and overly convoluted; the one-line conclusions to what should have been major story arcs was a let down again and again.  There where several times when the author could have reintroduced threads to improve the poor pacing (how about the newly minted wolves turn on their leader, Beck?; or perhaps Grace decides to explore her extra-sensory abilities by tracking Jack herself); but instead the author just drops them entirely until the end of the book when she resolves them in a mere sentence or two (the apology by Beck to Sam is a perfect example of the authors half-hearted attempts to tidy up lose ends).  So, not only does the book suffer from too many plots; it suffers from conclusions that leave the reader wanting.  Furthermore (and equally frustrating), the author even goes so far as to bring up plot points repeatedly that she never explores in the text that are critical to the storyline as if she had, leaving me to wonder if I was suffering short-term memory loss (I looked and looked for a reference of Grace telling Olivia about the werewolves and couldn't find one even though it is referenced on several occasions).    The last thing I will say is that I wish the author had let her writing stand for itself rather than force it into the semi-romanticized prose she seems to favor.  Her efforts at creating a \\"poetic\\" love story was so overdone that it bordered on cheesy (the much maligned song lyrics for example).    All in all, I'd recommend taking a pass on \\"Shiver\\" - it will only leave you cold.
B00005U2JL|5.0|That is correct, I am not a true Marilyn Manson Fan.  Portrait of an American Family was about the only MM album  I actually liked.  The rest spent to much time attempting to make this artist seem weird or maybe was an attempt to appear similar to certain Alice Cooper recordings.  When I first saw this DVD, I had accidentally checked it out from the local Library.  I do not recall what title I was reaching for but somehow this ended up in my stack.  So I got to see this video for free by accident.    Although I still thought MM appeared to be a little strange in his on stage activities, he really seemed to get a rise out of the audience, and eventually even had a stagnant rocker like myself enjoying the show.   Although it may not have been as grand as seeing Kiss or Alice Cooper -- it did seem to fit into this same catagory.  I still think Rob Zombie is a much better artist than MM, but this concert is worth looking into.
B004498KPU|5.0|Excelent product, after so many years we finally can have all Michael's viedoclips together with image quality though it could be in blueray.  The only complain is about \\"Blood on the dancefloor\\" which is in a remixed version and didn't semm so good as the original.  Anyway,  I give 5 stars!
B000BTJDGC|3.0|In my opinion this movie is an excellent one time watch.  I like how the whole story is being told as a murder trial but besides that it is just your average possession movie.  (The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This knife is awesome! Love the feel, balance, and weight! I bought this knife to take camping but I am going to buy another one for my vehicle. An all around tough knife! Love it!!!
B003AO1SVS|4.0|Great album, cheap packaging. I pulled the lyrics booklet/poster out of the sleeve of the cover, and when I tried to reinsert the lyrics booklet/poster back in, the cover ripped a quarter of the way up the front. It's a cheap paper material, almost intentionally so. The poster feels like old newspaper. I thought I was getting a good deal when really, based on the packaging alone, this album is only worth $7. However, the Black Keys are amazing, so pick them up on iTunes at the very least.
B00127RAJY|5.0|My cable carrier has the Level1 workout available on On-Demand. I was pretty fit to begin with, but I love this workout. Jillian will get results. My body feels great after doing level1 a couple of days in a row. The workout isn't boring because you aren't repeating the same moves, each \\"set\\" of weights/aerobics/abs has a different set of moves. I like this much better than the \\"lose weight in 8\\" type of workout where you repeat the same moves over and over. Jillian's work out flies by. I can't wait to get this DVD and try the other workouts. Also, Jillian has a yoga workout that will kick your butt, that I've tried on On-Demand also.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I was immediately drawn to the plot of this film which is why I instantly ordered it from Amazon. I was not at all disappointed. The movie is one of the most moving I have ever seen and it has easily become one of my favorite films of all time. First of all, I love pets and, in the family, we always have a pet dog or cat. Secondly, the idea of a pet's love and devotion has always been so true in our family as our pets have shown. Many years ago, I had a pet cat who, after I had left home to live elsewhere, continued to wait for me to arrive every night. Hachi's love and devotion for his master is a testament on how dogs can return the same love and devotion that was shown to them. The movie made me cry buckets of tears. Kudos to Richard Gere for acting and starring in this wonderful film and cheers to Lasse Halstrom for directing this film with so much care, love and sensitivity. I will always remember you for directing this wonderful movie.
B002VPE7AQ|5.0|I am an avid reader, and read about everything I can get my hands on. This book was given to me by my best friend and I have never read anything better then this. It is so heart-wrenching and beautiful. The story warms my heart and I fall in love with Alex everytime I read the book. :) Keep up the good work Simone Elkeles!!!!!!
B004K4IZ3G|4.0|I loved this movie... and will love it again when I see it on video. I just need to suspend any type of thought that might take away from the awesomeness.<br /><br />There are a lot of things I can say to bring it down... like the End of Line Club guy. Great actor wasted on an over-the-top character.<br /><br />My biggest complaint was (SPOILER ALERT)... you never see Tron's face except in flashbacks. I would have loved to see Tron fight it out with Clu at the end with his helmet off... even if he got derezzed. I hope if there's an extended cut they had more of Tron in it and just left it out for some absurd reason.<br /><br />Yeah, you can probably start picking it apart if you think too much into it... but it's a movie about something that's completely beyond reality... kind of like the Matrix.<br /><br />Just enjoy the ride; the amazing visual effects and the knockout females. And if you want to appreciate it even more watch the original... holy cheesy Batman!!! Yeah, it's the original and it spawned a whole new era of digital effects... but it was still cheesy.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|This film is probably director John Ford's crowning glory (he won the Best Director Oscar), but the key piece to this wonderful mosaic of characters in this American tragedy, is Henry Fonda (Oscar winner for Best Actor).<br /><br />The two roles I most remember Fonda for is his portrayal of the holdout juror in \\"Twelve Angry Men\\" and in the role of Tom Joad, in this poignant tale of hope among ruins.<br /><br />I first saw this film when I was in the eighth grade (1971), and I never forgot it. It was one of the first videos I purchased after I bought my VCR, and I have two DVD copies. Fonda's performance is one of the strongest I've ever seen, and I think it was easy for him to being Joad to life because of his own Midwestern roots. Fonda grew up in Omaha, Nebraska, and as a youth witnessed the lynching of a black man named Will Brown. Fonda later said that the experience had a profound effect on him and it showed in many of the underdog and everyman roles he chose.<br /><br />Joad is a character first etched in the psyche of Americans in the novel by John Steinbeck on which the film is based. He is an ex-con, but a down home fella in the truest sense of the word. He's a cynic, whose discerning view is honed by the despair his friends and family suffer when they lose their land during the dust bowl of the 1930's.<br /><br />I won't elaborate on the plot any further: I think most of us know the story. What makes the film a classic is not so much the plot as the acting and cinematography. The black and white film further emphasizes the stark reality that America was a \\"tale of two cities\\": Americans surviving hard times and so-called \\"Oakies\\" who lived on hope as much as bread and water.<br /><br />The cast is a large one, but Ford has no problem showing us the contrast in each one, from the sad-eyed hope of Ma Joad (Jane Darwin, who won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress) to the merriment of the children who travel across country in the family's jalopy and who despite their poverty, find joy in just being. The viewer never gets lost in the shuffle and can see that each character is sharply defined.<br /><br />Oscar worthy execution not only from Fonda, Darwin and Ford--but also John Carradine as Casey, a former preacher who has lost his faith and is the most downtrodden character of all these tragic figures.<br /><br />Though the story takes place nearly a century ago, this tale of real Americans stands the test of time and will be enjoyed by generations to come.

0446195529|1.0|I have read ALL of Mr. Baldacci's writing and was very excited to find the Camel Club was back.  I read the book and found it to be, as all of his novels are very complex in plot however this attempt was rather weak in substance.  Every other book has had a believable solution to the mystery.  While it is not inconceivable that this story could be a actual situation, it is closer to the edge of science fiction than I care to spend the time reading.  It is sad that an end to the CC comes on such a 'missed beat'.  I am afraid that, in search of a revival Mr. Baldacci has visited the cemetary one to many times.

B002QW7AJY|5.0|I now realize that it would have been a terrible shame if I had not viewed Pandorum because of the poor reviews. It is in fact one of the best SF movies made. It is way superior to most movies in this genre.<br /><br />First of all, the scenery, and the mutated hunters are extremely well done. It has the feel and atmosphere of a well done SF story. In fact it stands up very well in comparison to the Alien movies although it is difficult to match the creative artistry of Giger -the hunters are extremely well done. They are not only very frightening in appearance but their style of motion is very effective. Most of the characters and dialogue in Aliens is pretty dumb, reflecting the worst average Joe stereotype, which Pandorum, fortunately avoids for the most part.<br /><br />The lighting and cinematography is superb which goes a long way to give it the right claustrophobic feel of being locked in a crippled spaceship. Great atmosphere.<br /><br />Second, unlike a lot of Hollywood SF films, the story is not full of contradictions and utter stupidity -although it is by no means ingenious. The ending is a nice surprise.<br /><br />I enjoyed it very much and found it suitably scary and I recommend it to SF fans. Not surprisingly the average film critic neither understands, nor appreciates more serious SF films, for whom Star Wars is a masterpiece. For true SF fans who read SF books by real SF authors Pandorum, in my opinion, is for adults a far, far better movie.
0439023521|5.0|This novel, the first in a trilogy, is written for a young adult audience (7th grade and up) with a female lead.  But The Hunger Games had more than enough firepower and complexity to completely captivate this middle-aged male.    I won't ruin the book by telling you much about it, but imagine a mash-up of Shirley Jackson's classic 1948 short story The Lottery and the novel The Running Man by Stephen King (writing under the pseudonym Richard Bachman).  Take those ideas from a 16-year-old girl's perspective in a future America that hasn't turned out well, and you've pretty much got the idea.    Written in the first-person, the lead character's voice had me from page one.  Once in a while Ms. Collins slips up and falls out of that strong voice for a phrase or two.  Usually that takes me out of the story, but with The Hunger Games the occasional off notes only serve to remind me how stinking good this book is and how powerful the voice of Katniss is throughout.    It's a violent book.  Characters suffer gruesome injuries or are killed by spears, fire, insects, arrows, rocks, explosives, etc.  I'm not sure every 7th grader is ready for this one.  There's a love triangle of sorts running through that rings false because it's all too chaste.  That our heroine spent all those days alone in the woods back home with her hunting buddy, and he never once put any moves on her--well, it defies logic.  I guess that must be one of the conventions of YA fiction--violence okay, sexuality not okay.    Despite its tiny flaws, this is one beautiful book, and the humanity in it comes through like the voice of the singing mockingjays in the land of Panem.

B002ZG974M|5.0|I have to be honest, I saw the trailer for this movie while I was pregnant so I thought I'd like to watch it anyway. But I didn't end up seeing it until after my baby was about 3 months old. I suggested watching it with my husband and surprisingly he liked it as much, if not more, than I did.    The whole concept of the movie is simple, but so incredibly interesting. Taking 4 babies from different parts of the world and following their first year seems like a boring concept, but when I got into the movie and saw how differently we do things in the United States to those babies born in the other countries was mind boggling. My favorite part had to be when the baby from Nambia pooped and the mother wiped his bottom on her knee and then wiped it off her knee with dried corn. Absolutely amazing.    I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see an enjoyable, cute and funny film.      (The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.

B0049OSQ18|5.0|I know it is early in the year, but The King is Dead is such a very good album that it is going to be hard to top as one of the best albums of 2011. From the first song to the last, The King is Dead is such a pleasure to listen to. The instruments and the singing are first rate, while the lyrics will melt your heart.  I will be honest, I am fairly new to The Decemberists. I recently purchased Hazards of Love, which I appreciate for what it is, but I also find to be very dark, heavy handed and ponderous. The King is Dead, however, is the opposite. It reminds me of weekends spent on Mt. Hood, playing next to the river, or walking in downtown Asheville during the Fall. It also reminds me of R.E.M's sixth album,\\"Green,\\" which in my opinion is one of the greatest R.E.M. albums, especially for Peter Buck. But The King is Dead is without a doubt its own masterpiece with a unique sound I hope  will continue to be explored in future Decemberist's albums.

1439102813|5.0|A surreal glimpse into Alzheimer's world; Genova subtly slips the reader into the confusion, frustration, and powerlessness experienced and how the supporting cast (family and friends) adapts, accepts, and moves forward either selfishly or selflessly with their loved one.  According to Alz.org, Alzheimer's is the sixth leading cause of death.  Genova's book provides a morsel of understanding for the many of us who have been or will be touched by Alzheimer's disease.
B003UESJH4|5.0|The King's Speech is a shoe-in to win the Oscar for Best Picture, as is Colin Firth for his role as Prince Albert and then King George VI. Geoffrey Rush deserves an Oscar for best supporting, though let's not rush to judgement. In a way his role was equal to the King, just as he demanded they treat each other as equals in their speech therapy sessions, but he wasn't hampered by a speech impediment, unless you count an Australian accent. OK, us yanks can't really tell the difference between a British accent and an Australian, but apparantly it is a big deal.<br /><br />Rush really did a great job of acting, and so did Helena Bonham Carter, Guy Pearce, Michael Gambon, Derek Jacobi, and Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill. Gambon, Pearce, and Bonham Carter, as royals, were all too human, but to the manner born, make no mistake. Derek Jacobi, who you might have seen as the Roman Emperor Claudius, in I, Claudius, was sufficiently sanctimonius as Archbishop Cosmo Lang, though I wouldn't have minded seeing Dana Carvey in the role, just for laughs (on second thought, it would have been very distracting, no matter how straight Carvey played it, to have the Church Lady cast as an Archbishop). Some might say that Timothy Spall was too ugly to play Winston Churchill, but I say he was just the right amount of ugly. Another great character role for Wormtail.<br /><br />On the surface, it wouldn't really seem like a stutterer's speech therapy would make a cinematically rich enough subject for an Oscar worthy film, but it was remarkably well done, and also the stakes were high. It was an historic moment, as England was on the brink of World War II, and the recent innovation of radio broadcasting meant The King's Speech would be heard throughout the nation, and the world. A lot was riding on this speech, and as Ludwig Van Beethoven's Seventh Symphony, Second Movement, gradually swells to a climax, we hear the results.<br /><br />I am going to go out on a limb, and predict that The King's speech will win the Oscar for Best Picture.

B0000CF30C|4.0|I wasn't too keen on Aerosmith at first -- and growing up in the 1970s, if you weren't too keen on Aerosmith, you probably weren't too cool, either, according to your friends. The band was hugely popular with the blue-jean set back then, especially males -- if memory serves me right, the band used to refer to its three-fourths-male concert audiences as \\"the blue army.\\"<br /><br />Part of my problem was I really did think some of the critics were right: Aerosmith was just Rolling Stones Lite. Certainly, there was an influence. But my other problem was the songs ... or lack of them. \\"Dream On,\\" from the first album, was OK till singer Stephen Tyler reached the Shriekosphere near the song's end. \\"Mama Kin\\" was mildly engaging. But much of the rest of that first record just didn't sound that appealing. \\"Get Your Wings,\\" the second album, did little to sway me.<br /><br />But when \\"Toys in the Attic\\" came out in 1975, even I had to admit it: The band had kicked it up not just a NOTCH but about three or four of 'em. The songs were amazing: \\"Walk This Way\\" and \\"Uncle Salty\\" and \\"No More, No More.\\" There was a cover, too, of a nasty old blues song called \\"Big Ten-Inch Record\\" that was just hilarious good fun.<br /><br />And then there was \\"Sweet Emotion,\\" the best song of the band's career at that point. From Tom Hamilton's boiling bass line to the crunching guitars of Joe Perry and Brad Whitford to Joey Kramer's killer drums to Tyler's spot-on lead vocal, it was a perfect rock anthem. And Tyler was keeping his voice in a slightly lower range, so that he sounded more growly than girly.<br /><br />And speaking of girls: My memory also says this is where Aerosmith's fan base started to shift. Young women started going to the shows with their boyfriends, and buying the records. Aerosmith was held in very high esteem, in fact, by my first serious girlfriend. Sweet young lady; she even forgave me for spilling beer one time on their \\"Greatest Hits\\" album. In fact, it pretty much started our relationship -- she thought I was a funny klutz, and stopped me from wincing and trying to clean off the album by putting me in a lip-lock I'll never forget.<br /><br />This may be my favorite Aerosmith album, and \\"Sweet Emotion\\" definitely is my favorite song in their repertoire. Note: If you're an SACD person, the SACD version is worth getting. The surround mix is spacious and revealing without being too pretty. In other words, it still sounds like rock and roll. \\"Sweet Emotion\\" is especially nice, with the percussion and talk-box vocals that start the piece loitering in the surround speakers while Hamilton's bass churns it up out front. The SACD is long out of print and very, very pricy now. Two recommendations: Pony up the money and get one.

0786715103|5.0|A personal and heart-rending account. This is definitely a `boots on the ground' rendition of the terrible tragedy in Rwanda in 1994.<br /><br />We sense Romeo Dallaire's naivet&eacute; when he arrived in Rwanda in late 1993. As he was learning about the intricate political groupings surrounding the Arusha Peace Agreement so, he to, was being assessed - particularly as to the level of commitment of the U.N. to Central Africa. This was shortly after the Americans had lost troops in Somalia. How much was the West (and the U.S.) going to invest in commitments for this `Peace Agreement'?<br /><br />Mr. Dallaire's central theme is that the West is not interested in sacrificing lives to prevent genocide in a country like Rwanda. There is no resource payback; like in Kuwait. It is highly likely that 5,000 well trained troops would have saved the lives of most of the 800,000 who were slaughtered during the genocide. These 5,000 troops are far less than what was dedicated to the liberation of Kuwait in 1991.<br /><br />Mr. Dallaire's description of the genocide and the continued ineptitude of the U.N. are most poignant and excruciatingly sad. Rwanda, at the time, was on the Security Council and did much to thwart the efforts of Mr. Dallaire and others to inform the world that Rwanda was soon to reach a breaking point with the region erupting into a holocaust of violence if the Peace Agreement were broken. The U.N. in Rwanda had several warnings from their contacts within the community that lists were being prepared, weapons were at the ready and that a countdown was imminent.<br /><br />Despite the fact that the writing style can be at times cumbersome with numerous \\"I\\" references and constant use of acronyms - the depiction of events during the genocide is unparalleled in their searing emotion.<br /><br />This is a book that needs to be read to understand recent world events and why the West needs to intervene to establish some form of civil authority; otherwise events cascade into an apocalypse. We can no longer blind ourselves to the poverty and lack of infra-structure that exists in many Third World countries.d ourselves to the poverty and lack of infra-structure that exists in many Third World countries.

1439177783|4.0|I applaud Portia De Rossi for being so damn honest. I'm not confident that I'd have aired my dirty laundry in the fashion that she did. This book may seem odd, full of descriptions of radical behavior that you can't comprehend if you've never suffered with an eating disorder. Fortunately, I have not suffered with this disorder to the degree that Portia De Rossi did, but I found myself heading down a dangerous path, as I continued to lose and lose, wanting only to be as thin as I possibly could, and feeling \\"fat\\" even at 99 pounds. Don't get me wrong, I, too, found portions of her story unbelievable. I couldn't imagine taking anything, let alone my weight, to such an extreme, but all in all, I understood almost everything that Portia De Rossi described. At times I found myself wanting to close the book, thinking, \\"I'm not near this bad. Surely this book won't help me,\\" but I was wrong. Towards the end of the book, I was reading the text through puddles of tears in my eyes.<br />Again, I'm not sure that I would have been so completely honest, but I am appreciative to this woman for telling her story. It showed me the much darker side of a world that I was heavily flirting with. As soon as I finished her book, I ate and ate and ate. All I wanted to do was eat, because silly enough, her words made me feel okay about eating, and the description of the pain she endured, on behalf of her disorder, scared me.<br />I still have to battle with my inner thoughts regarding body image, but this book, along with various other things, helped me be okay with myself.<br />Thank you, Portia De Rossi

0345479092|2.0|I read this book when I was pregnant with my now 3-year old son.  Before he was born, this book sounded nice.  I liked the EASY schedule and some of her advice, related to sleep and feeding. Once he was born, I realized how out of touch this woman is. At first I was frustrated with my son because I tried to implement some of her EASY stuff but it just didn't fit.   EASY did not work at all for my son or for anyone else I know.  My son needed to be nursed constantly at first, which I get the sense Hogg would not support.  Most of her breastfeeding advice is totally bunk - like wiping off your nipples after feeding? Huh? I think a lot of these types of books actually make mothers more insecure and frustrated because moms think their babies should fit nicely into these schedules and patterns but every baby is different and imposing bad advice from a supposed \\"nanny\\" on them just makes us all crazy.

B000ZLFALI|5.0|I just finished watching this movie and I had to comment. People who did not live those years probably see it as a fantasy based on reality. For me it was a reality masked as fantasy. It was an entire era compressed in what seemed to be a short period of time. I have to admit that there was a point in the movie when I couldn't help but cry because it felt I was living that part of my life over. Totally unexpected. The movie captured the changes happening during the late 60's and 70's, not just in the nation but in me. I have to buy it so my daughter can understand what those years were like and me. For me it was an emotional trip and I'm sure it will be the same for many others of my era.
B003UESJIS|4.0|Any port in a storm.<br /><br />Tom (Jim Broadbent) and Gerri (Ruth Sheen) are a long-married, comfortable upper middle class  couple. Long past cat and mouse games (the pun in their name once called \\"brilliant,\\" then not mentioned again), Tom is a successful geologist and Gerri a counselor. They are happy with their lives and have reached a point where the knowing look or wink becomes its own code.<br /><br />Their subtle love language and calm demeanor centers and stabilizes their social circle which, in Mike Leigh's intimate, disturbing \\"Another Year,\\"  resembles a downward spiral.  Gerri's 20-year co-worker Mary (the picture's centerpiece, portrayed by Leslie Manville) is  a lonely, needy forty-something divorcee thinly portraying herself happy spending more time with more wine at Tom and Gerri's. Tom's bloated buddy Ken (Peter Wight) fights drink to forget his workaday job. Tom's brother Ronnie (David Bradley) deals with the shock of losing wife Linda and with his bitter son Carl (Martin Savage, who jolts sour lightning into the final 30 minutes of what had been a low-key drama.) Characters and episodes (family cookout, funeral, golf game, gentle lunches forming Tom and Gerri's social life) split across four seasons forming the title.<br /><br />\\"Another Year\\" meditates on self-acceptance. Tom and Gerri are happy to stay in, cook meals, grow tomatoes in their garden and share their bounty with friends. Mostly they listen, occasionally plying guests with drink we know they don't need. Mary and Peter, meanwhile, deny what age and bad choices have done to them, even attempting to deceive themselves. A scene where Mary takes Peter to the train station, then coldly refuses his advances provides one example., But more painful is Mary's failed pursuit of Tom and Gerri's son Joe and her cold treatment of Joe's fiance' Katie, leading to a rift in their friendship.<br /><br />Leigh's film also comprises everyday life vignettes. We learn in its first scenes the film provides no closure; a woman desperate for sleep and to overcome depression gets pills, is offered counseling, then leaves without our seeing her again. Ken does not return from his train ride; we see only glimpses of a nurse in Gerri's office who'd just had a baby. In a culture dominated by fabricated \\"reality\\" television, Leigh, cinematographer Dick Pope, and composer Gary Yershon let details accumulate, present them in  pastoral settings (backyard patios, gardens, even a golf course) and wrap them in subtle guitar/woodwind soundtrack belying the characters' angst and pain. It spoils nothing to say the dinner party, and life itself, went on after the lingering close-up of Mary closing the film. (The film clearly sends a message about alcohol being life's worst medicant and lubricant. The slogan on Ken's shirt - \\"Less Thinking, More Drinking\\" - becomes self-fulfilling.)<br /><br />Finally, \\"Another Year\\"  is about validation. Mary looks for a young lover/cook/gardener to validate herself, but her choices are as wrong as red used car causing nothing but trouble from her starting it. Carl self-centeredly attacks his father and everyone in the room after his mother's cremation (which he irresponsibly missed by minutes). Tom and Gerri find enough validation in each other (although much of it unspoken), but more in friends' lives observed and commented on (but left unhelped and even enabled until the end.) No villains, heroes or even closure here: \\"Another Year\\" came between last year and next year, snapshots of a life developed slowly and empathetically.

0071752854|5.0|Though I often find these kinds of business books dry and much too basic,  this one was a great read from the very first page onwards. Written in a lively,  entertaining style, the content relates to any business -- indeed, to any life situation.  The book mixes solid advice and real life stories with interesting scientific research.  If your life involves coming up with ideas and convincing other  people to buy into them, or if you're raising money,  it's  very worth your time.
B000H7JD4A|4.0|I Like it...Got this at the same time with The Final Frontier and Dance of Death. It seems that I always come back and listen to this one more than the two albums I mentioned earlier. The lyrics are awesome . Bruce voice is more focused and sharp than TFF but almost the same with DOD. The song have a consistent feel to it. Mid tempo, not a lot of power chords, nice amount of licks ( twin guitar ) in between the verses and then you add the required solo from 3 lead players. The songs are 7 minutes to almost ten minutes, but you can't really tell because it will not bore you with those riffs ( in between verses).<br />Here are some of the songs that I can describe to you:<br />1. The Pilgrim- sounds like something that came out of the Fear of the Dark album like Fear is the Key with a little Alexander The Great from SIT. Very nice twist.<br />2.These Colors Dont Run- Like a song from FOTD, nice lyrics, with keyboards but not overwhelming, 7 minutes, multiple tempo changes and maybe 3 lead parts, little progressive with the ohhhh,ho, hoooo's in the last part of the songs.<br />3. Different World- Only 4 mins..the singing has a Billy Joe phrasing from Green Day that annoys me...uptempo and catchy..the first one that will catch your attention, but maybe will be your least favorite after you truly digest the whole album.<br />4. Brighter Than a Thousand-  progressive in maiden's way, 8 mins, good lyrics..licks in between verses yummy...singing awesome, has the Harris bring it down tempo changes in the middle ..builds up good, repeat everything again making it 8 mins plus the nice epic leads.<br />5. The Longest Day- An angry song, almost 8 mins..repetetive..singing strained..most popular on you tube, with almost 3 minutes of tempo changes with leads thrown in making it almost 8 minutes...the parts with the singing gets boring but the instrumentals are awesome.<br />6. Out of the shadows- a Ballad, singing in low key for the verses..then builds up for the chorus..very basic verse, chorus verse,  lead ,chorus lead ( twin) outro lead then ending like Axl Rose yeaaah, yeah, yeah.<br />7. For The Greater- Nine 1/2 mins long..progressive in Maiden's way. full of keybords..sounding like STYX, specially the solo part, background singing also sounds like Tommy Shaw and James Young  harmonizing, some serious lyrics, singing one of Bruce's best..sounds like a Piece of Mind singing( maybe unnoticeable for some because the song is mid tempo.),not so epic leads with Dream Theater sounding tempo changes ..sound really different because of the keyboards. ..a little boring for me.<br />8.The Reincarnation- My favorite, 7 mins long..power chords, epic leads, singing low key in the beginning, builds up, base prominent, mid tempo, nice lyrics.<br />9.Lord of Light- 7 minutes..long intro ( base with some low key whisper singing) too long for me, power chords, singing builds up..some tempo changes, epic leads..slows down again then ends...intrumental parts are very very nice...parts with the singing just Ok.<br />10.The Legacy- 9 minutes, very long quiet intro..too long for me, keyboards to make the guitars thicker which is good, midtempo, voice is powerful and clear, catchy mid tempo chorus..slows down again in the middle, build up like a Kansas song then more epic leads with twin attacks thrown in, then more twin attacks before the song ends.<br /><br />Very strong album from Maiden...general feeling for me was to listen to The Loneliness of The Long Distance Runner, Rime of the Ancient....SSOASS ... the EPICS..the whole vibe of the albums sounds more like these songs. Get it .<br /><br />NICKO... Sorry about the NO mention..you're the REASON I listen to Maiden then Adrian...Nicko's parts are always incredibly mind blowing..no need to explain more.,chorus lead ( twin) outro lead then ending like Axl Rose yeaaah, yeah, yeah.   7. For The Greater- Nine 1/2 mins long..progressive in Maiden's way. full of keybords..sounding like STYX, specially the solo part, background singing also sounds like Tommy Shaw and James Young  harmonizing, some serious lyrics, singing one of Bruce's best..sounds like a Piece of Mind singing( maybe unnoticeable for some because the song is mid tempo.),not so epic leads with Dream Theater sounding tempo changes ..sound really different because of the keyboards. ..a little boring for me.  8.The Reincarnation- My favorite, 7 mins long..power chords, epic leads, singing low key in the beginning, builds up, base prominent, mid tempo, nice lyrics.  9.Lord of Light- 7 minutes..long intro ( base with some low key whisper singing) too long for me, power chords, singing builds up..some tempo changes, epic leads..slows down again then ends...intrumental parts are very very nice...parts with the singing just Ok.  10.The Legacy- 9 minutes, very long quiet intro..too long for me, keyboards to make the guitars thicker which is good, midtempo, voice is powerful and clear, catchy mid tempo chorus..slows down again in the middle, build up like a Kansas song then more epic leads with twin attacks thrown in, then more twin attacks before the song ends.

0307269752|1.0|I never felt strongly enough about a book to write a negative review, but this is truly one of the worst books I've ever picked up (after my friend kept pushing it on me). What were Vanity Fair, Boston Globe, Chicago Tribune, and NPR thinking!? Plenty of people have reviewed it, so to save time, this roughly sums it up:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />\\"... It's a woefully shallow piece of work. Larsson's dialogue is wooden and his characters are underdeveloped. Only Salander is fully realised and, to me at least, she seems like a cartoon or video game character who has wound up in a novel by mistake. Her presence just makes the story more implausible.\\"
B000683VI4|1.0|I was SO disapposinted when I got this product.  The seller totally sent a cheap burned copy to me in a clear cover.  The DVD was not even marked, no images on the top of the DVD; it was silver on both sides of the DVD.  Very disappointed, never buy from this seller again.  Movie played ok.
B00383UJ2U|5.0|You'll love this great album right away as I did.<br />This is one of those 'hard to find' quality music we are always looking for these days.<br />Very nice vocals + Modern & pleasant music (Very well arranged).<br /><br />No matter what kind of music you usually listen to,... You'll love this excellent Album !<br /><br />(((( BUY IT ))))
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was a very exciting book. While i wouldnt find it a good read for kids i found it too enjoyable to put down. I cant wait to start the second book to find out what happens next.
B004BJMEO6|5.0|Everyone needs to see this film!  There are a few laughs here and there.  But, it's the gorgeous women gazing into each other souls that is the best part of this movie.  I have never seen this storyline before.  Of course, I fantasize about straight women all the time, but this one is different.  It's not about being straight or gay, but connecting on a deeper level, regardless of human form.    Yeah, it's hot, but after the butterflies in my stomach calm, the story is excellent!    Thank you to the film makers and all who were involved.
B0041T4O9Y|5.0|\\"The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind\\" is the most inspiring book that I have ever encountered. William rises above hardships which would break most grown men, however he perseveres to do great things. He changed the lives of his entire family, by powering his home by teaching himself how to build a windmill from a book. As an Engineering student I appreciate his ingenuity and intelligence. I would recommend this book to everyone looking for an quick and interesting story.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|It is very rare nowadays for a product to possess good looks, quality & function. The JJ Elevate utensils have it all. No brainer, buy 'em!
1594744475|4.0|I really enjoy treating my kids to fun bentos for lunch. I received the book as a gift and it has some really fun ideas and recipes inside! However, I am in a rural area and it is hard to find many ingredients listed.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I ignored this film when it came out in theaters; just didn't interest me.  I vaguely wondered why an actress of Meryl Streep's caliber would stoop to take such a silly role.      Then one frozen day I made it out of my house to the library and picked up some DVD's to help me make it through the week.  After several sub-zero nights and frozen pipes I was in the mood for something that looked warm and sunny.  The picture on the cover of the DVD was ridiculous but at least they appeared to be dancing on a beach in front of blue water.    Wow!  It didn't take long for the warmth in this film to melt my mid-winter depression.  I didn't see the stage version so I wasn't handicapped by making that comparison.  And I never liked ABBA so I didn't care if anyone mangled their songs.      I admit that I had soured on Meryl Streep, after having been a major fan.  She seemed to have become so mannered and self conscious that I lost interest in her.  But here....another WOW!  This and her performance as Julia Child have reinstated her into my personal fan club.  She is just so filled with life!  If anyone is willing to suspend belief in the credibility of the script, and just go along with the sheer exuberance of the film, they can have a great time.     True, there are lots of \\"flaws\\" for the serious film goer which is probaly why critics didn't like it.  Besides a silly story, the casting is somewhat strange, especially the three men.  Colin Firth, whom I adored in so many roles, is awkward and looks embarrased for most of the film.  But that is his character!  And I give him credit for putting himself in such an embarrasing position.    Pierce Brosnan is good as the aging cute guy who can't sing but gives it a try.  He is losing his looks but that's good for the role, too.  He's just a guy who made a mistake and has paid for it and now is getting another chance.  The Swedish fellow seemed well cast.    Amanda Seyfried was perfect as the prettiest little gumdrop of a girl you'd ever want to see in a movie.  She was more than a pretty face, too, she acted very well.  The scene where Streep prepares her for her wedding brought tears to my eyes.  Christine Baranski, an actress I never liked, was terrific here.  I loved the bit where she has an almost-romance with an adorable young Black barboy.  Julie Walters was terrific, too.  I was glad to see that each of them had a chance to shine.  The numbers with the three of them performing were wonderful!  So much energy, so much joy!    I can see now why Streep and the rest chose to make this less-than-Oscar-worthy film---for the sheer fun of it!  It really comes across.  A really good time awaits anyone who can open up to sheer, mindless enjoyment.  Intellectual snobs better pass.
B003Q6D2BE|4.0|Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) retired form the CIA is just trying to make time over the phone with Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker) when to his chagrin he finds he is the target of unfinished business and anyone he likes may be dispatched along with himself. Now he must find the culprits or cabal that is out to depose of him and a hand full of other CIA retirees known as RED's (Retired and Extremely Dangerous) this will require getting the band back together.<br /><br />Watch and have fun as the impossible becomes possible and you cannot help saying \\"Stay in the car\\". Of course Bruce Willis played in a lot of action shoot-um-up movies but Helen Mirren may soon surpass him. I know the movie is not unique but who cares? It is just fun to want them act it out.
1595141715|4.0|Seems like this question is the deciding factor to either write a good or bad review for a lot of people. Hannah is a girl who feels victimized by thirteen people around her, and so she chooses to record tapes describing exactly why before committing the ultimate act. There's much debate over whether her reasons are significant enough to cause her to off herself, but I felt they were. The problem is that about half of all high school girls will go through many of the things she has, but that doesn't make the reasons any less terrible.   Things people have chosen to do- maybe huge or tiny- can impact another person's life very easily. I feel that this is an important message, and Thirteen Reasons Why portrays it quite nicely.
B00417HV14|3.0|I agree with the guy who gave it 2 stars that it's not worth the time or money to up grade from the DVD. The Audio has NOT been upgraded to DTS Master Audio or Dolby HD and has the same audio quality as the DVD so no upgrade there either. The video IS brighter and sorta washed out on the whites and not much better video clarity than the DVD. I use an OPPO BDP-83 universal DVD player and a Panasonic TC-P50G20 Calibrated Plasma TV. So if you are thinking \\"Blu-ray, it's got to be better\\" think again. If you don't have the DVD yet then ya' go for the BD version, the whole concert is on 1 disc instead of 2. This is an awesome concert and performance that deserves a better BD version but it seems that Joe's Mgt. is not to concerned about audio quality, even his CD's seem to be so bright that on a good system are hard to listen to for long periods with out listener fatigue. I'm a huge JB fan and have all his CD's and both DVD's, but someone needs to address sound quality. Had I not had the DVD first, I would probably give this a 4 1/2, a ding for the bright video anyways.<br /><br />I wish Amazon had a 3 criteria rating that would make for a quicker, more accurate and fair rating of Cd's, DVD's and Blu-ray's.<br /><br />1. Performance<br />2. Quality of Audio<br />3. Quality of Video (for DVD's and Blu-ray's)<br /><br />1.***** Awsome concert & performance!<br />2.** NO DTS Master Audio or Dolby HD up grade!!! Same 5.1 as DVD<br />3.** Bright transfer, colors slightly washed out compared to DVD<br /><br />Artists that wish to have there performances recorded and recognized should be held to a standard. Poor Audio or Video, no matter how good the performance, is still a BAD product. Those who would still rank that product highly just because of performance are not doing the industry or the band justice. Demand better and we will get it, settle for less and that's what you'll get.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|My wife and I watched this movie twice (the kids watched with us the second time). I can't stop thinking about it. It makes me wonder about the different ways that people learn... visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. Why do some people relish a good lecture and others fidget and yet others drift off to sleep? What are the implications regarding our educational system? Or what does that say about the types of people that excel in politics, business or even religion? Are we excluding those who think differently from contributing to the conversation? Shunning them instead of embracing their uniqueness? Writing them off because they don't fit a mold? My mind has been spinning since I watched this movie. These are only a few of the things that I have asked myself since watching. There is so much more to it... excellent performances, insights into autism, and even life and death. I highly recommended it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have read every book by Nicholas Sparks and have not been disappointed with any of them. Get tissue ready for the ending of Safe Haven. You'll need it! Can hardly wait for the movie.
B0021L8V0M|4.0|Full of surprises from beginning to end.Full of top notch action and fun.If you are a fan of spy thrillers and stuff like that,this is your film.You don't know what Jolie will bring in each scene,as well as the other cast.Is she a spy or isn't she? You be the judge!!!  Get it now.
B000W1V5OC|5.0|One of the best concerts you'll ever see. Ever. Vocals, musicianship, arrangement, lighting.
B0013FBS20|5.0|The movie is brilliant. One of my favorite movies. The alternate ending, that says it is \\"controversial,\\" is just lame really. It does not add anything to the ending and I believe it is actually worse than the original, not saying the original wasn't good though, because it was amazing.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I have become hooked and am so proud to own a solid copy of Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog!  If you have never heard Neil Patrick Harris sing you are missing out on something gorgeous.  Felicia Day is adorable and an incredible actress.  Go check out her mini-series, The Guild!  And Nathan Fillion is just the most lovable jerk you could ever meet. :)  This is 40 minutes of pure greatness.  There is no person on Earth who cannot enjoy this movie.
B000001EJ8|5.0|I just love the sound of Vangelis. He predates Yanni's musical melodies and songs. Vangelis is clearly a master of the sound. This collection of songs includes his classic Chariots of Fire and my favorite, Antarctica. The songs sounds like they should be played in a church or cathedral. It's a beautiful complilation of sound and music intertwined like one. There was also some vocals done beautifully well.    Vangelis never fails to surprise me as a musical artist. His sound is unique and not easily duplicated. When I hear Vangelis, I can imagine figure skaters on ice skating to his music. I also feel very spiritual listening to him as well.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I started this workout 3 weeks ago and absolutely LOVE IT!  First off, it's cheap.  I have a 2 year old (and a full time job) and therefore not a lot of time to get to the gym or motivation.  Second off, it's quick.  I tell myself....it's just 20 minutes (technically 25 if you include the warm up and down) and I don't have to go running out to the gym, etc, etc which is most likely an hour of my time.  She combines legs and arms into one exercise so you're working different muscle groups at one time.  And thirdly, it keeps you interested, as in, it's not boring.  She combines cardio, strength, and abs into 3 circuits and you rotate through each circuit 3 times.  By the last circuit, it's tough.  But that's the point, you need to be hurting to see results.    I do have a couple recommendations on the video workout.  Each workout gives you the option to do an \\"easier\\" or more \\"advanced\\" version so don't feel like you have to stay stuck on one Level.  She has 2 other girls besides herself to watch and one does the easier workout while one does the harder/advanced workout.  I did Level 1 maybe 3 times to start then moved up to Level 2 and started with the easier versions of all the exercises.  Plus, it's a little awkward at first because you do have to learn \\"the moves\\".  I mix it up right now between Level 1 and Level 2 so I don't get bored.  I have sneak peaked at Level 3 and don't feel I'm quite there yet.  Buy 2 or even 3 different lbs hand weights.  I use 5lbs right now on all the exercises, but on some of the exercises I could bump up to 10lbs now and on some I wish I had 2.5lbs to bump down to because they are hard!
0545123283|5.0|I read both books in the series in 2 days. I was that drawn into the characters and the story. Shiver was a great set up to the main characters, their need to be together and the how they fought to stay that way. I loved when Grace called Sam \\"my wolf.\\" Linger was a great continuation of the story. It dug deeper into the relationships but never questioned them. The bond between Grace and Sam never waivered and there was no question that these two will always be together. I did think that Grace's health should have been a bit more in the forefront. I felt like she was really sick and Sam never acknowledged it til the end. It felt rushed in the end and that all of a sudden Isabel knew all and Cole figured it out at the last second. I loved the Isabel/cole connection and wished that was explored more in the book. But again, the relationship between Grace and Sam was never questioned and was so obvious to everyone, especially Cole who I didn't think had a sincere thought in him. I really enjoyed his character in the end because he stood up to Grace's father, figured out the cure, and gave Sam the option to go with Grace. His character changed the most and was affected by everyone. Can't wait to see where the story goes in Forever. It will be a long wait.
B000GCFX3Q|4.0|I liked this book. The only complaint I have is that the author went on tangents so often. I ended up skipping a lot of the tangents to get back to the story. I find this is pretty much the author's style but it was just overdone in this particular book.    That being said, I liked it, it's a quick read, it's touching at times. Overall, good British Chick-Lit
1932100660|5.0|I have been a vegetarian for many years, but after reading this book, I immediately became a vegan. I was convinced by the solid research studies cited in the book which overwhelmingly prove that a plant-based diet can prevent and even reverse heart disease and prevent cancer.     As a bonus, I feel better and have more energy by eliminating dairy and eggs from my diet. I also eat much healthier as a result because I replaced cheese and other dairy products with legumes, more whole grains and vegetables.    The China Study is very well-written and almost reads like a nutritional novel. I enjoyed the book immensely and highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in the link between diet and health.
0736092269|5.0|I'm a Martial Arts Instructor and Personal trainer, this is a must have if you are serious about working out and taken care of your body. I'm not going to get all into the craziness but you will definitely get a better understanding of the muscles in your body and how they react to training.
B001GXTXTO|5.0|This album is one of my favorites from The Black Keys. They happen to be one of my favorite bands, so I may be biased but it is definitely worth buying. It has that older rock sound with some R&B which we just do not hear enough of these days. It is hard to believe that a couple of white guys made this album, but it is freakin' fab. I HIGHLY recommend this album and while you are at it, check out the rest of their music.
B002ZG98CS|2.0|That's it! The first 10 minutes are good and the rest of the movie not very. Felt like the movie budget ran out after 10 minutes.
B0014CQNTK|5.0|\\"Juno\\" is one of my favorite movies and it was so great to get this 2-disc set for about $5-$6 less than I could have gotten it at any store.  The item was in the exact \\"just like new\\" condition that the seller advertised.  It arrived significantly ahead of its scheduled delivery date and it functions flawlessly.  From start to finish, it was an excellent buying experience.
B002ZG981E|4.0|4.5 / 5 Stars  Fascinating !   Captivating story, thought provoking, great visuals !   ... too much shooting and hunting ...    In reply to the review entitled \\"Rating Depends On How Much Foreign Film You've Watched\\" I say:  I do not see much ***correlation*** between \\"Inception\\" and \\"L'Année dernière à Marienbad\\" or \\"Hiroshima mon amour\\", to the point that one might say these two Alain Resnais French films of 1961 and 1959, respectively are ... more original ... or deeper.  I have watched these two films without subtitles.    \\"Inception\\" is interesting, quite original, an attempt to explore the world of dreams.  The exploration is a combination of known things about dreams (e.g. outside stimuli influence dreams), and lesser known things (questions), such as \\"What happens when we die in a dream ?\\", \\"How is a dream within a dream ?\\", \\"What happens if two or more people could share a dream ?\\"   The answers Chris Nolan (both British and American by birth) offers, may be viewed as speculations, of course, but, nonetheless are interesting.  Not seldom he gets the Physics right - Gravity (= acceleration, as Einstein points out):  loss of it; creation of temporal artificial gravity.   Chris Nolan suggest that Gravity effects propagate to dreams - true or not, but interesting.  He even suggests that in a dream world, Gravitation my pull in multiple directions !  Why not ?!    I have my own questions:  - Will understanding dreams help us further uncover the mysteries of the mind ?  - Will we ever be able to design dreams - ours and others ?  - Will we ever be able to share dreams ?   Will this be useful ?  - Will we be able to visualize dreams, say on a TV scream dreams ? - ours and others ?  - Will this help treat currently incurable and most destructive mind (brain) diseases such as Schizophrenia, Bipolar Syndrome, Alzheimer, Parkinson ?  - Will we ever be able to do \\"Extraction\\" and \\"Inception\\" ? - for non-harmful, maybe good purposes ...    So, while we may not fullyagree with the story proposed to us, the film is thought provoking, but, because of the nested layered dreams (dreams within a dream within a dream ...), hard to follow for many viewers.   That is where the DVD/Blu-ray comes to the rescue - Rewind (many times) !   Not possible in the theater, but easily done at home.    Next, please, pay attention:  at the end of the film, the top (\\"toupie\\" in French, right ?) is still spinning, which allows us, the viewer, to formulate two possible interpretations:  1) It is, finally reality;  2) It is (still) a dream - maybe, everything was a dream from the very beginning ...  A fantasy ?    A good work of art (visual or written) should be susceptible to multiple interpretations, right ?   Hamlet:  he is tormented  - maybe he really saw (the ghost of) his father, maybe not, maybe his uncle murdered his father, maybe not ... should I take punitive action or not (\\" ... to be or not to be ... \\").   The Penrose Steps (nice drawings by Max Escher !) - an optical illusion:  are we going up or down ?   Maybe both at the same time.    I like Leonardo di Caprio and Marion Cotillard a lot.  The personal story of the characters they play (story which causes trouble to all) brings humanity and depth to this film, and the two actors are very convincing in their roles.  By the way, \\"Mal\\" means \\"bad\\" in French.    My only real criticism is this (therefore 4.5/5 stars):   too much shooting, too many people chasing each other, and too often (a diversion/distraction)- it makes it more attractive to some viewers, but ***lowers*** the overall value of the film !  It makes it look \\"less deep\\" than Chris Nolan would have liked.   Notice this:  The Academy nominated this film in several categories, among others:  \\"Best Film\\" (which refers to the producers, one being Chris Nolan), \\"Best Original Story\\" (Chris Nolan), but not \\"Best Director\\" (who is also Chris Nolan).   Maybe this is due exactly to the fact others noticed the same thing:   long and frequent chases, lots of shooting ...  The thrilling should come more from the tension between characters, from the collision between their minds and souls, their problems, worries, and less from fast paced and sustained action sequences.    Last but not least, I like the use of one of my longtime favorite songs:  \\"Non, je ne regrette rien\\" sung by Edith Piaf.   It is used in the film as a signal to wake-up the dreamers in a synchronized fashion (it even propagates from one dream level to the next), but, perhaps it also means this:   no matter what happens, or happened, whether this is reality or it is just a dream, I do not take anything back (I regret nothing).    Good quality with extra features Blue-ray.   I do not regret having watched.

B0021L8V0W|3.0|I enjoy spy films, and remember having liked the 1994 \\"Clear and Present Danger\\" (starring Harrison Ford), also directed by Phillip Noyce, so I decided to see \\"Salt\\" and bought the Blu-ray from Amazon.   The disk has all three versions and lots of interesting extra features, including a commentary by Phillip Noyce, and interviews with real-life spies, such as the famous former Counterintelligence KGB General Oleg Kalugin, now an American citizen.       \\"Salt\\" is an enjoyable film, better, I say, than all Bourne films, or \\"Mission Impossible\\", with the possible exception of the 1996 one, directed by Brian de Palma, where Angelina Jolie's father plays, and also better than many James Bond films, with, perhaps, the exception of the 1963 \\"From Russia with Love\\", from which \\"Salts\\" borrows something - remember Colonel Rosa Klebb played by Lotte Lenya ?    Moles in the CIA (and FBI), \\"sleepers\\", \\"illegals\\" in dormant state waiting to be activated for sinister purposes against the West, Soviet/Russian (KGB, SVR, FSB) defectors after defectors ... all are true and not new (Kalugin confirms this) - see \\"Telefon\\" (1977, with Charles Bronson), \\"The Fourth Protocol\\" (1987, with Pierce Brosnan), \\"The Good Shepherd\\" (2006, also with Angelina Jolie), \\"The Company\\" (2007, TV with Michael Keaton).    Angelina Jolie, Liev Schrieber, and Daniel Olbrychski do well, and, like many others, I liked watching them, but I have two serious problems with the plot.  Not so much the impossible acrobatics, escapes and infiltrations ... but the premise of the film itself:  - How is it possible to depict (and make us believe that) The Secret Service is so ineffective ... Bystanders ... ?  - The \\"defector\\".  1. A Russian spy comes to the CIA and reveals top secrets about former Soviet, now Russian operations against the United States.  He even uncovers the identity of a mole inside CIA ranks.  OK - Good deeds !   But, if he is a genuine defector, why, after being interviewed, does he kill his CIA guards, and then escapes ?   Doing this only discredits his testimony.   That is not how a genuine defector behaves.  2. If, on the other hand he is not a genuine defector, but an active enemy agent, someone who came to activate \\"sleepers\\", why does he have to come in and reveal everything to the CIA, including uncovering the identity of a top mole in the CIA, thus, gravely endangering the mission his agents (the sleepers) are to carry out ?   If he only needed to provide instructions to his undercover agents, he could have used other methods of communication.   This is not how an offensive (let us call him \\"a non-genuine defector\\") behaves.  3. If, further, this was is a temporary defection, with the sole purpose of uncovering to the CIA the identity of a mole (the Theatrical and Director's Cut versions of the film, but not the Extended version suggests this), than it was not at all necessary to reveal the rest of the plan to the CIA (that this mole, a Russian agent will soon attempt to kill ...), and, definitely, it was absolutely wrong for the defector to kill his guards and escape.  Credibility !  So, bad logic. Am I wrong ?    We, the viewers like thrillers, action, adventure, spy stuff (deception after deception, double-cross, double agents), but we also like solid, smart and plausible intelligence (brain, analytical) work behind the action - e.g. \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\" (1979, TV) and  \\"Smiley's People\\" (1982, TV), both with Alec Guiness.    Not too much \\"intelligence\\" work in \\"Salt\\", just a lot of (great !) action sequences ... there is too much Phillip Noyce expects us to accept, take for granted.    On the positive side:  \\"Salt\\" may also be viewed as the soul-searching journey of a double-agent who struggles with the question: \\"On which side am I ?\\" or \\"On which side should I be ?\\"   In the end, the agent decides where the allegiance should be placed, and choses the side who advocates morality and humanity.    If you do not ask (too many) questions, \\"Salt\\" is definitely enjoyable, and the Blu-ray disk is great.
B002ZG980U|5.0|If any film defies a simple synopsis, it's Christopher Nolan's Inception. Few films released by major film studios are this layered, this complicated, and this well-rendered. I must admit that it took me three viewings to accept it for what a masterwork it is. Upon first seeing Inception, I questioned how it would hold up on subsequent viewings due to how much time the film spends explaining the process of inception. Turns out it holds up rather splendidly even on a third viewing.    To give a synopsis in the simplest terms possible, Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an extractor, a thief who steals secrets from people's minds while they're dreaming. Being the most skilled extractor, he's hired by a billionaire named Saito (Ken Watanabe) to try a different approach; inception. Saito wants Dom and his team not to steal an idea, but to plant one in the mind of Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy). While Dom and his team are skeptical, Saito gives Dom an offer he can't refuse.    If there were any doubts about Nolan's brilliance as a screenwriter, this film should silence those doubts. Few screenplays are this complex, this exciting, this original, and this accessible. Nolan is a master architect of storytelling and not a scene or line of dialogue is wasted with everything absolutely essential to telling his story. While certain science-fiction elements may be recycled from other films and Cobb's relationship with his dead wife Mal (Cotillard) is similar to DiCaprio's other 2010 role in Shutter Island, it's one of the most stunningly original films of 2010. While it does spend an ample amount of time explaining the concept of both extraction and inception, once we enter Fischer's dream-world just about an hour in, the film becomes a heist movie unlikely any I've seen before.    Not that anyone will find this to be unique news, but Nolan is a director of great vision who has made a film that is unlike anything I've seen before. Slow-motion is nothing new, but Nolan uses it frequently for Inception and in the most elegant ways. Nolan and his collaborators, specifically cinematographer Wally Pfister, production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas, film editor Lee Smith, and the various art directors, set designers, and special effects experts involved have crafted this film perfectly. I'm not saying it's a perfect film (only time will tell), but Nolan and co. have achieved perfection with the overall look of the film. Look at each dream level as the characters pass through it; the rainy street, the beautifully-designed hotel, and the snow-covered fortress. The film was budgeted at $150 million and no expense was spared to put the vision in Nolan's head on-screen. Even the special-effects are mind-blowing, unique, and beautiful and the score by Hans Zimmer is marvelous; emotional, ominous, and highly memorable. I've always respected Nolan as a director, but there was one scene in this film that really convinced me what a visionary he is. The gravity-defying fight sequence between Arthur (Gordon-Levitt) and some dream henchmen is one of the great sequences of 2010, magnificently filmed and eloquently choreographed. It's a sequence that would make Stanley Kubrick proud and it does recall Kubrick in sheer elegance and scope.     The star-studded cast also includes Ellen Page (as architect Ariadne), Tom Hardy (as identity forger Eames), Michael Caine (as Cobb's father-in-law), Dileep Rao (as Yusuf, a chemist), and the late Pete Postlethwaite (as Maurice Fischer, Robert's late father). Despite Inception falling more into the science-fiction/action genre, Nolan has said that he wanted the character's emotions to drive the film. Nolan's film may be a $150 million action extravaganza, but the emotional depth he sought was achieved through the use of a marvelous cast. The dynamic between DiCaprio and Cotillard has it's similarities to Shutter Island, but it's the driving force of the film and it works. Cotillard does a magnificent job portraying a character that exists entirely in Cobb's subconscious and DiCaprio shows that he's one of the few actors that can express emotion through the use of subtle facial features so effectively. Since Cobb spends significant time in the film experiencing a certain emotion that he's not expressing out-loud, it's up to DiCaprio to convey that emotion to both the characters around him and the audience. DiCaprio is an actor that some people don't take to very easily, but he's one of the most acclaimed living actors for a reason. Gordon-Levitt plays Arthur totally straight, but is charming none-the-less. Murphy finally gets a significant amount of screen-time in a Nolan film and shows the range that must attract Nolan to squeeze him into a film whenever he gets the chance. Finally, Nolan makes a star out of the immensely talented Tom Hardy, an actor of tremendous range who elevated a small film called Bronson into something highly memorable. Hardy plays Eames, the identity forger of Cobb's team, with smarmy, humorous wit that makes him one of the film's most memorable characters. Nolan obviously recognized this as he promptly cast Hardy in his next Batman film.      The scope and magnitude of this project, whether you love it or hate it, is something to marvel over. What other director has or could make a film this complicated with intense action sequences that will excite even the most unmotivated viewer? Inception is an incredible film that only grows richer with more viewings. While it took three viewings for me to fully appreciate and come to terms with this; it's one of the best films of 2010. Intellectually-stimulating entertainment with one hell of an ending, that people will be debating and discussing for years. While a film that becomes this acclaimed and this popular so quickly will attract nay-sayers out in droves (which is fine as some people truly do not like the film), few can argue what an innovative, brilliant piece of filmmaking this is.    GRADE: A
0385342047|4.0|I always feel with the Shopaholic books that I'm stepping back in stride with a dear friend and it's like we just saw each other yesterday, even if it's been a few years.  I adore the characters in the Shopaholic books and Kinsella's style, flare and endearing stories always make me smile.    \\"Mini Shopaholic\\" is full of antics and trials, just like any other Shopaholic book.  Here, Becky is now 29 and her daughter, Minnie, is two years old and, perhaps, spoiled?  Is she?  Isn't she?  And how will Becky and Luke sort it all out?  The Brandon-three have been staying with Becky's parents since every house they've attempted to purchase has fallen through for one reason or another.  The banking world in England also falls through, making everyone tighten their belts (and if you know Becky, you know the difficulty this proves to be... especially with so many tempting tiny-tot clothes and toys and...).  Add to all this Becky's desire to throw Luke an incredible, mind blowing, ultra awesome surprise birthday party and you can just imagine all the situations Becky finds herself in.    Like I said, I always love these books, and this was no exception.  However, I docked a star because I didn't feel that everything was *quite* as tied together as in previous books.  Also, I found myself a tad annoyed that Becky had seemed to make so little progress with her shopaholic-ness, ditto for her and Luke's ability to communicate.  But, overall I was smiling quite a bit for the last few chapters, pleased with Kinsella's choices.    If you loved the earlier Shopaholic books, I definitely think you'll like this one!

Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)  I watched this when it first came out, as a teenager and loved it.  Now I have children of my own and enjoy watching it with them.  The characters are funny, especially Chunk.  In a weird way, it does give a good message about loving everyone for who they are.  It's also a thrill to see the lost pirate ship and all the gold and jewels they find.  It's a fun way to relive your childhood while sharing a part of it with your own children.
B0041B4H1M|4.0|Released in the blu-ray format only a few months ago, 'Deep Blue Sea' is one of those films that highlight questions I have for this technology.  First, though, I'll say that I really enjoy what blu-ray does for certain types of film -- especially those with lush cinematography and vibrant natural scenes.  So in the end, I'm rooting for it, even if I wonder if it's appropriate for everyone -- or every film.      With 366 reviews, I don't think it's worth anyone's time to recap this movie.  I enjoyed it -- it's a fun, turn-off-your-brain-and-enjoy-the-ride sort of flick, although if I spend too much time thinking about the film's internal logic afterward, it doesn't hang together as well as it does while I was actually experiencing it.  Regardless, if you haven't seen it before, and you are a horror/adventure fan, then I give it a strong recommendation.  Chances are, though, that you know about the film and may only be wondering whether to purchase it, or to upgrade from regular DVD to blu-ray.    'Deep Blue Sea' relies on three main things for it's effects -- actual footage of sharks, mechanical sharks and CGI sharks.  One thing I've noticed with HD and blu-ray is that CGI is more noticeable to me than before.  (This was especially clear after renting the abysmal remake of 'Pirahna' in HD.)  I know that some people do not like CGI-heavy films -- I would not consider 'Deep Blue Sea' CGI-heavy, but others might.  Still, this blu-ray version is only going to enhance the difference between real footage and that which is computer generated.  When I first saw this film several years ago, I don't remember noticing the CGI effects nearly as much as I did while watching this blu-ray transfer.  Since some of the most intense scenes are dependent on computer generated footage, I found this to be somewhat distracting.     Another question is whether or not to 'double-dip', or upgrade to blu if you already own the DVD.  Since I didn't have a regular edition of the film when I found this one on sale recently, the choice was easy for me.  But the blu-ray has no significant difference in the extras included, so the actual 'upgrade' may be small.  A good upscaling DVD player, or a blu-ray player playing a regular DVD of this film won't match the blu (which does have a beautiful picture), but they might be good enough -- at least good enough to skip double dipping.  Less definition may (or may not) also help disguise some of the CGI -- it probably depends on your experience at picking out computer generated footage.    Extras on this disc are rather limited: A trailer, two making-of featurettes, a couple of deleted scenes (available with or without commentary), and a feature film commentary by director Renny Harlin and Samuel L. Jackson.  It is obvious that Jackson and Harlin recorded their comments seperately, and they alternate for about half the movie, until Director Harlin takes over completely.  I thought this was one of the better commentaries I've listened to by people who were actually involved in the film.  (Most of the time I would just as well listen to commentary by film historians.)  Jackson's comments I could take or leave, but Harlin's were interesting, pointing out technical aspects and an inside view as to how some especially tricky shots were done.  I found it surprising how much more CGI there was than what I had picked up on, but what I enjoyed most were when he noted a couple of tributes to other films I had missed.  As a film buff, I appreciate these, and Mr. Harlin came across as a thoughtful filmmaker -- so much so that I will probably look for other films of his now.      According to the product details on the item page, the aspect ratio is listed at 1.77:1, which doesn't reflect what I saw.  On a 16x9 TV, 1.77:1 should fill up the entire screen, and it does not.  The blu-ray case lists the ratio as 2.4:1, which conforms to my experience; so even with a widescreen TV, there will still be black bars at the top and bottom of the screen.    Fun trivia:  The license plate Thomas Jane pulls out of the tiger shark's mouth in the beginning of the film is identical to the plate Richard Dreyfuss pulls out of the stomach of the shark in 'Jaws'.  Who says commentaries aren't useful?
1439107955|5.0|A moving, eloquently written, immensely readable, beautifully worded history of cancer.   As a recent breast cancer patient and breast cancer survivor, I was immediately driven to read this book. Loaded it on the Ipad and, as I found myself wanting to highlight and underline its amazing passages, I now have it in hard back as I feel drawn to have and keep and read and re-read. Kudos on a tour de force with passion, warmth, education and immaculate story telling.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|I am at a loss for words trying to think of a way to describe this minor masterpiece about a friendship between two misfits.  \\"Let Me In\\" is the American remake of a recent Swedish film \\"Let The Right One In\\" and although there was much I admired about the foreign film, I much prefer this remake as it is beautifully told, the casting is perfect and the cinematography and background music all mesh to tell this touching love story, albeit with a nasty and violent twist.    Owen a lonely 12 year old whose parents are divorcing, lives with his drunkard of a mother. He is also a magnet for every bully in his school who torment him mercilessly. Abby is the newly moved in 12 year old girl next door and sensing a kindred spirit in each other they develop a special bond. The twist is, Abby has been 12 for a very long time and is a cold blooded monster who needs human blood to survive.    i will not detail any more of the ins and out of this movie's story and although there is blood and violence, it is mostly kept in check and even though the film retains the curious ending of the original film, it leaves you to wonder-what does the future hold for Owen and Abby.    i was also pleasantly surprised that the movie was directed by Matt Reeves of \\"Cloverfield\\" infamy. The movie that was filmed by someone doing the jitterbug while riding a skateboard.  Thankfully he learned his lesson as \\"Let Me In\\" has been directed and photographed with a sure and steady hand and the results are wonderful.

B002KQOCJ2|3.0|In short, this is a solid return. I don't think anybody expected Dirt part II, and as long as you don't you should dig it. The old AIC sound is there. I've heard people say the new singer sounds like Layne. Well there are moments in this album where I swear I can hear Layne. Of course Jerry often sang half the songs anyway, so in some ways it seems nothing is missing. By the way I ordered the vinyl, as I heard it came with a copy of the cd also like some vinyl releases do, yet my copy had NO cd. Maybe some do, but not my Amazon copy. An Mp3 code would have been nice. Still, the double vinyl is transparent/clear and that's sweet. Anyway it's nice to get a quality album from the group after all this time. Soundgarden, you're next.
1599218011|5.0|Have you ever read a book and wish you had written it? That's what happened when I devoured Crazy Sexy Diet, which has sat on the top ten NY Times bestseller list for the past two weeks since publication. Why? It's fun and sexy and personable like past bestseller Skinny Bitch but with a loving, nurturing twist and a turbo health boost. If Skinny Bitch inspired you to drop the animal foods, then Crazy Sexy Diet will take you to the next level, inspiring you to incorporate the healthiest foods that nature provides and feel amazing. Think you already eat super healthy? There's still something in this book for you, which covers so much more than what you put in your mouth. Highly recommended!
B0021L8V0M|4.0|Salt is a Bourne film on speed -- that's the best way to describe it. Evelyn Salt, as portrayed by Angelina Jolie, is a super-spy who spends the vast majority of the movie running, jumping, fighting, blowing stuff up, and generally causing all sorts of really cool looking mayhem. This is an action movie, through and through. The suspension of disbelief is mandatory here, because without it the audience won't last more than 15 minutes. Salt tells the story of CIA agent Evelyn Salt, who is set up (or is she?) by a mysterious Russian agent. According to him, Salt is in fact a Russian spy planning to assassinate the Russian president, providing Russia with provocation to launch their own attacks on the United States. Convoluted? Sure. Ridiculous? Maybe. However, once Jolie launches into action, the film never stops for a breather and what follows are some of the best action sequences in recent memory.<br /><br />The fact that Salt succeeds despite a fairly ludicrous central plot is a testament to the prowess of Angelina Jolie. With the Tomb Raider films, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Wanted, and now Salt, Jolie has proven to be not only one of the biggest movie stars on the planet, but perhaps it's biggest action star as well. The fact that we are talking about a woman who probably tips the scales at 115 pounds is a testament to the charisma and power that Jolie conveys onscreen. You just believe that she could take on two armed secret service agents in a narrow hallway and leave them both unconscious. Angelina Jolie is one of the very few true movie stars left, and Salt would not work without her. Liev Shreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor play the agents assigned to catch Salt and both do a predictably good job. Shreiber, in particular, has really come into his own lately and it's nice to see him working with good material after the dreadful X-Men Origins: Wolverine.<br /><br />Aside from the breakneck pace and star power of Jolie, the greatest thing that Salt has going for it is the mystery of Evelyn Salt's true intentions. Is she really a Russian spy? Or is she playing both sides? Just who is she working for? The screenplay by Kurt Wimmer (Equilibrium) does a good job of keeping the audience guessing right up to the finale. Yes, the screenplay can get a bit ridiculous, but that's par for the course in this type of film. It should be stressed that this is not Syriana, or even a Bourne film. Phillip Noyce previously brought us both Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger and this time around he largely ignores the political machinations and double-crosses of the Jack Ryan films for a more action-focused entry. Nevertheless, the pedigree is there and Salt remains a damn fine political thriller. Noyce takes it to the next level, a level filled with more explosions, more car chases, and more hand-t0-hand combat. If that doesn't sound like your cup of tea that's fine, but for the rest of us, this is the action movie of the summer, thus far. Enjoy Salt for what it is. This reviewer did. 4 out of 5 stars.Salt's true intentions. Is she really a Russian spy? Or is she playing both sides? Just who is she working for?

B0048LPRD2|5.0|Gaspar Noé's Enter the Void is a stunning, one-of-a-kind work of art. I'm not going to describe the story; there is not much story anyway. What is here is a hallucinogenic phantasmagoria of bright colors and wondrous sights and sounds which will take you into the brain, through this life and the afterlife, through several levels of consciousness and... Tokyo. It is not a story so much as an experience. It's beautiful, sometimes repulsive (typical of Noé), deeply thought-provoking and intensely emotional. Enter the Void is about the love between a brother and sister. A tale which plays out over two (or perhaps even more) planes of existence. It's a visual poem devoted to the wonder of the human spirit: life, love, death, tragedy, dreams, memory, sadness, happiness. A meditation on death and the possibility of life after death; also the evolutionary cycle of human life. It can be seen as many things and interpreted in many ways. It's one of those films that is intended to provoke discussion. It can also simply be viewed superficially as one heck of a cinematic acid trip. Whatever meaning you choose to assign to it, if any, it is a staggering film that will not be soon forgetten. Even someone who despises it (and I have already talked to one) will have a hard time denying the creativity and innovation on display here.    I will make no claims that Enter the Void is perfect or flawless. Very few movies are and it makes no difference. Who ever said that something had to be flawless to be a work of art? Flaws might serve to make something more meaningful. My criticisms: It's too long. At 161 minutes, the second half of the film drags on a bit. Like all of Gaspar Noé's films it can be hard to watch. There's nothing here quite as bad as the rape scene in Irréversible, however there are moments that might make you squirm. Anyone who is epileptic should stay away from this or any Gaspar Noé film as he is fond of fast-cutting and bright strobe lights.    Oh, and he is fond of camera movement. My god, the camera movement. If ever there was a movie that deserved to be seen for camera movement alone, it is Enter the Void. This is one of the most extraordinarily photographed movies I have ever seen. From stunning POV work, to long steadicam shots to bird's-eye-view to Superman-esque flying-through-the-sky shots, Enter the Void has camera choreography that would make the jaws of Alfred Hitchcock and Brian De Palma drop.      Gaspar Noé is a fearless, visionary filmmaker. An artist who strives to bring his unadulterated vision to the screen no matter how un-commercial or hard to watch that vision may be. Despite having only made three feature films (\\"I Stand Alone\\", \\"Irréversible\\" and \\"Enter the Void\\"), Noé deserves, in my opinion, to be mentioned alongside the greatest artists of the past several decades. He directs furiously, as if his life depended on it. I imagine him directing as a conductor frantically leading a symphony orchestra in an earth-shattering performance of Beethoven's Ninth. I don't mean to compare Enter the Void to the Ninth Symphony (or do I?). I see the kind of passion and excitement in every frame of this film that is only produced by a truly talented artist in love with his craft. It should be seen, or rather experienced, by anyone who expects more out of film than just a way to pass the time. If you believe that cinema is capable of life-changing art which illuminates the experience of living a human life, then Enter the Void is an unmissable film.     All that and I didn't even mention the opening titles. Two words: freakin' amazing!

You'll be rid of the unwanted emotions which come along with it to live a peaceful, ho-hum life. At least, that is supposed to happen in Lauren Oliver's sophomore release, \\"Delirium.\\" But the world according to this new way of thinking is an oppressive one. And Lena, the young narrator, once so determined to be \\"cured,\\" finds love blooming in her.<br /><br />\\"Delirium\\" starts off slowly, building a world run by a government which strips you of your emotions and controls your life, from the person you will marry, the friends you will have, and keeping you \\"safe\\" from the outside world. If there's even a hint of rebellion, you will be humiliated or thrown into a place worse than jail, or worse, never seen again.<br /><br />Small wonder that teenage Lena can't wait to have the procedure so she'll never feel love again. Not just love of a partner, but even passion for hobbies and love for family and friends. As she confesses to us, the readers, the reasons why she wants the procedure, we can surely sympathize. It's not until she's receiving her evaluations to get matched with her potential husband that her world starts to change. She meets a young boy and starts to rebel against her strict aunt, her quiet life, and even the laws.<br /><br />Think [[ASIN:B00005JMJG Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind (Widescreen Edition)]], a story about a guy who wants to forget the woman he loved more than anything; he gets a procedure to erase the woman from his memory, only the more he forgets, the more he wants to remember her. Not that I'm saying Ms. Oliver is stealing this idea. She makes it her own down to the slightest detail; she crafts passages from a book Lena and others live by. Her descriptions of the way people are kept under the oppressive thumb of the government is clearly thought out.<br /><br />I had read Ms. Oliver's first book, \\"Before I Fall,\\" which I enjoyed immensely, and decided I would give this one a try.

She has one close friend, a wild child named Hana. She is, to put it nicely, one dimensional.

How can she possibly go on with the procedure now that she has a taste of something that's supposed to be wrong? Alex, on the other hand, is charming and patient, yet not afraid to push Lena's buttons.<br /><br />The ending will... well, it was definitely a kick start for the next books.

B00082IJ08|5.0|I bought this album the other day and began listening to the songs in bits and pieces and out of order. I knew the songs were pretty good but I didn't care much for some at first. Boy did I make a mistake by not listening to the songs in the intended order! After loading them onto my music player I sat down to doodle with the music playing in my earbuds (by the way, listen to these songs with good quality headphones or earbuds - you won't regret it) and as I listened while doodling away, I noticed themes coming together and brilliant things hidden within the music. I love how the entire album tells a sort of story - kind of a musical commentary on modern living. The message is heartfelt and sad, yet some of the songs are incredibly upbeat and very easy to dance to. After paying closer attention to the album I came to love everything about every single song on the album - even the \\"joke\\" song, White Light. If you haven't heard this album already, please buy it. It's completely worth the listen. I am completely in love. Five thumbs up...I mean five stars. Haha.

And while I liked it, I didn't think it was as great as everyone was claiming. So when I read about DELIRIUM, I didn't get my hopes up. But boy, was I surprised! This book was so much better than BEFORE I FALL!<br /><br />Right off the bat, I was engrossed in the story. A world without love? I can't even imagine having to live and not being able to feel things. I really can't fathom it. I am a very emotional person, so the idea of being \\"cured\\" of the \\"disease\\" is astonishing to me! But the way the community was described made it feel so real. Very scary! ( I loved the quotes that were at the beginning of each chapter - they were from \\"real\\" books talking about the disease.)<br /><br />I quickly grew to love Lena. She tried so hard to be good and follow the rules, yet she knew something was wrong and she followed her *gasp* heart. And I loved Alex, too! What a sweet guy!<br /><br />There are several surprises in this story. I have to say that I personally didn't like the ending, but that doesn't stop it from being an amazing story. The ending is good and it fits; it's just not what I thought was going to happen. It's been awhile since I have felt that strongly about a book and thought about it so much afterwards. So far, this is my favorite book of the year (both 2010 & 2011)!<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Andrea
