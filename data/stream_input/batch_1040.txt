B001KVZ6G6|5.0|ordered Pixar/Disney's UP brand new on blu-ray and it's great one of the best movies pixar has released.  the movie came as stated BRAND NEW with the wrapping and everything great price.  great for the whole family can be given as a gift to anyone of any age.
B0002VS3B0|5.0|This movie is rated as among the one hundred best movies ever made. It is very interesting, because there is a code of honor, that the British must obey. They live by a structure, a framework of philosophy, a set of principles. For example, prisoners of war must work, however, the officers are not allowed to do manual labor. There is no compromise nor negotiation on this! The Japanese also have code of honor. The commander must finish complete the construction of the bridge by the deadline or commit suicide. The prisoners of war will not cooperate under Japanese supervision and the Japanese demand that the officers perform manual labor. The deadline is fast approaching and there is no bridge, not even a shadow of a bridge. The Japanese give in to the British and the officers take over the task of supervision. Under the British code of honor, the prisoners of war must not only work, but the quality of work must be good. The British discover, that the foundation of the bridge is under soft ground and as soon as the railroad crosses the bridge, well, the whole bridge will come down. The Japanese are told, that the half-completed bridge must be abandoned and that they must start all over again on solid ground. Imagine the look on the Japanese commander's face. This is his life, that we are talking about. What about the deadline? Believe it or not, the British finish the bridge on time and the commander's life is saved. However, there is another issue, that has come up. Some people are suggesting, that this is cooperation with the enemy. After all, the bridge will contribute to the war effort of the Japanese. The construction of the bridge is giving aid and comfort to the enemy. Is it high treason? Well, I let you decide that question. If you want to watch a movie without profanity, with an outstanding plot, with an excellent character development, with reality nor fantasy, then this is the film for you. They do not make movies like this anymore. They do not have the actors for it, like William Holden and Alec Guiness.
B000002GJH|5.0|Love this CD!!  Good compilation of musicians on this CD that create and play great music together.
B003W5C0VM|5.0|Just saw at the theater...can't wait to own the blu-ray. Great performance and sound quality. Very interesting lighting and camera work from the early 70's. A must have for Stones fans.
B0007TKNCY|5.0|I have loved this movie for years.  It is as good now as it was when I saw it 40 years ago.
B003HKN52A|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater in 1973. I owned a VHS Copy since the Early 80'S. Elvis was my favorite singer of all time so I Loved It. I had to own the DVD Version. I recomend this concert to all fans of Elvis old and new. Enjoy it well worth the price.
B0000060NH|5.0|What can you say about such a great album? This is obviously classic stuff, but it still escaped the ears of many people in the mainstream music world back when it was first released. Perhaps it got stereotyped as a \\"soundtrack\\" and wasn't given the full credit for the great album that it is. Marvin's vocals are top notch as usual, but the instrumentals on this album really propel it all. This albums flows so well, and takes you on such a joyous ride, that you're sorry when it ends.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is simply nature porn.  Its our wonderful planet seen in a way never before.  Intelligent and beautiful this is a MUST see especially for those that think our planet is just a tool to be used rather than respected and enjoyed.

0783225857|5.0|The story is a classic and the film has been a classic for years re: social injustice,.   The performances are great Gregory Peck and Robert Duvall are excellent in the roles and I wanted the film so that my sons could experience it and I have already shared it with my friends.[[ASIN:0783225857 To Kill a Mockingbird (Collector's Edition)]]
B00127RAJY|5.0|I never stick to workout videos but I decided to get this one to try to lose some weight before my wedding. I started doing this workout 5 times a week and ate a sensible diet. In 30 days since I purchased it I have lost more than 10 pounds, gone down 1 jean size and look so much better. I have 10 more pounds to lose, so now I have moved up to level 2. Jillian is tough but a very encouraging trainer.
1451539347|5.0|I'm slowly becoming a Jane Austen fan. My first book was Pride and Prejudice and then I decided to give 'Persuasion' a shot...and I'm glad I did!    This book tells the story of Anne Elliot. A woman of 28 who found love at 21 and lost it because she was persuaded by the family friend and her own family. But the story starts when she sees her former love eight and a half years later...it's a great journey.    Captain Wentworth's letter just made me bawl like a baby!!!    Amazing book, glad I picked it up!
B003BKF696|5.0|I only recently got turned onto this band, via this album, and I'm hooked. This is a solid collection of songs that pack a punch and take the listener through a blender of emotions. Nothing weak on this album. I'm anxious to hear their other stuff now too.
0345495004|4.0|A wonderful love story and a great insite into the era in which they lived
0307577589|1.0|Who can help me??  I didn't get this product & the link to connect with the seller didn't work.  I tried again, but with no response.<br />Thanks!
B00337KM2S|4.0|This movie broke my heart - between the unexpecting employees being fired to the major disappointment with the main character and his love interest -- really a very sad film.    However, with the economy continuing to collapse and the unemployment rate going up, this is a movie for its times.  Great acting and a good story make this a must see film.
B00003CXB4|4.0|We ordered this for our daughter to be able to the watch the movie before going to the play and it is fine for that purpose... I was just not sure if it was bootlegged or what... the front page and insert looked like they were copied (not so professionally). it looks like a copy of a dvd that someone could have bought in a market in Cambodia, though the video is good. Hopefully it will last a long time.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|I put off buying this CD for several months, wary of the hype. But once I took the chance, bought it and got it home I was blown away. From start to finish this album is a winner. Funky and a bit of the blues, plus a little something extra that's hard to put into words. But whatever this strange brew may be, I really dig it! Kudos also for the Jerry Butler cover!
B0036EH3U2|5.0|I absolutely love the Battlestar Gallactica series and had been eyeing the blu-ray whole series compilation for some time.  Then it went on a fantastic sale, which allowed me to pick it up and start watching the series all over again on my blu-ray player.  No buyer's remorse here.
159102594X|4.0|An anti-heroic fantasy where all of the main characters are morally ambiguous or worse. An England-like country known as the Union faces threats from the Gurkish Empire in the south and from the newly unified barbarians in the north. A group including a Northern warrior, an aging wizard, a torturer and a vain minor noble all end up in the capital of the Union and involved in plans to help it with the threats facing it, while still being mainly motivated by their own self-interests.    I enjoyed the book quite a bit, although this volume does not work as a standalone at all. It feels more like an extended prologue which mainly serves to get the characters together. There is not much plot, and the bigger storyline of the series does not start to become evident until the end. I enjoyed the characters though and it left me looking forward to the next book in the series.
B002RV01QI|5.0|I had heard this song many times as a background to emails and videos that I have recieved. I finally looked to see who the artist was and sampled some of the other songs on this CD. I love her voice and greatly enjoy this CD.
B003VB5E2E|3.0|I was all set to pre-order, but looked at what I was getting.  A re-mix of the last Crossroads fest!  I know most people purchasing this are guitarists also and had heard the Buddy Guy, Jonny Lang & Ron Wood set was amazing, but everything else is keeping me from ordering since I already have the previous two.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Was really shocked at how little I knew about our food production, thought there were better guide lines in place. Needless to say my eating habits have changed a lot. I now try to at least know \\"where\\" my meats come from.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Earlier this year I finished going through all seven seasons of the series The West Wing for the third time. I didn't actually see it during the years that it was broadcast; I bought it for a discount price on DVD, and got hooked. It's like a book that one can't put down, leaving the viewer wanting to know what might happen next. The author, Aaron Sorkin is a most gifted playwright, who among other things is able to take intangible things like intuitive judgments about people or situations, and make them visible through his drama, filled with real and heart-warming characters. In my view Sorkin deserves to get an \\"honorary\\" award from the Queen's honours list.<br />This is a wonderful series, to which I hope that the author will create a sequel some day, no doubt with Sam Seaborn as President (for reasons which will be clear to anyone who has followed it thus far). Most highly recommended.
B0024FA9IM|5.0|This 1998 remake of the 1960's TV show follows the Robinson family into deep space. Earth has exhausted its resources and looks for another planet to colonize. The Robinsons are the first to venture off to a new world in hopes of beginning colonization. But when the ship is sabotaged, the pilot is forced to take a detour and effectively getting... lost in space.<br /><br />The talented cast includes: William Hurt (Professor John Robinson), Gary Oldman (Dr. Zachary Smith), Matt LeBlanc (Major Don West), Mimi Rogers (Dr. Maureen Robinson), Heather Graham (Dr. Judy Robinson), Lacey Chabert (Penny Robinson), Jack Johnson (Will Robinson), and Dick Tufeld (as the voice of the Robot). Is it strange that my favorite character is the Robot? The acting is fantastic; and the special effects are spectacular, even compared to today's CGI. My one complaint is an annoyingly cute and equally creepy monkey-like creature that the Robinsons adopt.<br /><br />There is a lot packed into this action-packed, deep space adventure - terrorists, killer robots, cannibalistic spiders, mutations, and time travel. But at the heart of the story, it's about the Robinson family and their relationships. It's an entertaining, fairly light-hearted space romp that was more fun than I originally remembered. This is one I'll gladly add to my Blu-ray collection.
B003JTHESA|5.0|I agree with a few of the better reviews posted before this one, and will sum them up by concluding that this album takes a few plays to 'grab' you, but when it does it will not let you go.  This CD has something for every one, and frankly I do not understand the reviews saying that want more of that \\"classic\\" maiden sound.  Did they not listen to mother of mercy, the alchemist, or the talisman??  Especially with the \\"alchemist\\", that is simply the Maiden formula true and true.   Being a life long Maiden fan (i.e. I remember the \\"classics\\" when they were new) I am very critical (and skeptical) of all new material.  That being said I think the \\"Matter of life and death\\" (the album released just prior this) is probably their best work, and this CD is a great follow up.  The CD picks up in the middle with track 5 the alchemist (mentioned above) a classic maiden song but then segues into the Isles of Avalon, an almost indescribable maiden song, that highlights the three guitars like no other maiden song (around 4:10).  Avalon is maiden using decades of experience to construct a flawless song.  The best on the album, and (heretic I may be called I know) perhaps their best song ever follows; \\"Starblind\\".     Take my eyes for what I've seen.  I will give my sight to you.  You are free to choose whatever:  Life to live or life to lose.    Whatever God you know,  He knows you better than you  Believe.  In your once and future grave  You'll fall endlessly deceived.
0439023483|5.0|Absolutely fantastic! I'm not a committed book reader (I have a bookshelf full of bookmarks, as my partner points out) but read this one in less than three days. Couldn't put the book down no matter how hard I tried. Stayed up way too late to keep finding out 'just a little bit more.' This has left me with a couple of very tired days at the office...well worth it. Highly, highly recommended.
B002PEP4HI|5.0|This is a moving heartfelt, dynamic piece written and lived by Mitch.He lets you into a piece of his world that could be shared by us all. This is a book worth the time.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|This complete series is fantastic on BluRay.  I would recommend this for anyone who is a fan of the series as this is something that you can enjoy over and over again.  In true \\"Lost\\" form, there is even a hidden disc to search for and more easter eggs than the average person can find.
B001PJRAUS|1.0|Anyone who claims to love Jane Austen's work and ALSO enjoys this movie must be under the influence of an extremely strong substance. I have never seen the beauty and the respectability of a classic work so defamed in film in my entire life. Do you think Jane Austen would find it appropriate to talk of \\"landing strips\\" or various conversations on sexual orientation? I think not. Interesting concept for a movie, horrible execution. I am extremely surprised that this film was so highly reviewed...
B000EGEVZK|5.0|This is the ultimate Ramones video, from their humble beginngs to worldwide acceptance, to the very end.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Colin Firth is perfection as a portrayal of smoldering sexuality. Jennifer Ehle is nearly as good as a cool, cerebral but emotionally available heroine.  The father, Mr.Bennet, is a delicious melding of humor and sarcasm.  I do have two quibbles.  Mrs. Bennet, the heroine's mother, is aptly done, but her shrillness becomes wearing early in the story.  I would have preferred less volume and more subtlety in this character. Secondly, Susannah Harker, whom I know from other productions to be capable of a powerful performance, is strangely vapid in her portrayal of the eldest Bennet daughter. Being pretty and smiling a lot is simply not enough, and is in sharp contrast to the well delineated characterizations delivered by most of the cast. However, on balance this production is excellent, and in an imperfect world really is about as good as it gets.
B000UX6THK|4.0|first, I'm a big David Lynch fan.  He makes interesting and original movies. He is always thought provoking. This was his stab at episodic television.  Although the show only lasted two seasons, they were two ground-breaking seasons.  The town of Twin Peaks is almost a character itself, as the sleepy logging town hiding too many secrets.<br /><br />FBI agent (played by Kyle MacLachlan) will learn many of the town's secrets.  But first his main mission is to investigate the death of a local high school girl named Laura Palmer.  His investigation into this death leads him down various \\"rabbit holes\\" as powerful people in the town try to misdirect his search.  He quickly unravels other possible crimes linked to other citizens in the town.  His only ally is the local police chief, who seems to be the only honest person in the town.<br /><br />The series is special because of the colorful characters.  Each one is interesting to watch.  Each one has some sort of secret to hide or revenge to carry out.  The dialogue (in typical Lynch fashion) is sometimes funny, disturbing, and odd- usually at once.  The series is definitely a drama, and yet there is always a comedic scene or two in every episode.<br /><br />This series pre-dates \\"The X-Files\\".  The similarity is that both series deal with the abnormal.  In the case of Twin Peaks, the abnormal is the town itself and the people in it.<br /><br />* one of the best series of the 90's *
B0015DROBO|4.0|I had a hard time getting into this book. but stuck with it since it got such great reviews.  Once I got past the first few chapters. it became addictive and I didn't want to put it down.  I really enjoyed this mystery.
B000002IQ9|5.0|I ordered this Phil Collins album, \\"Serious Hits Live\\", and was very glad to see how fast it was sent to me and what great condition it was in.  I will totally order more things from here in the future...
B002ZG99G8|4.0|The Losers is a story of betrayal and retribution that doesn't take itself too seriously that concerns an elite U.S. Special Forces unit sent into the Bolivian jungle on a mission that goes awry. Were they set up by someone within their own government? The team: Clay, Jensen, Roque, Pooch and Cougar, must go rogue since they have been betrayed by the mysterious and powerful Max, an operative high up in the heirarchy of the CIA. They are recruited by the beautiful Aisha, who may have her own agenda, but it is one that also involves getting revenge on Max. Working together, they must remain deep undercover while tracking the heavily-guarded Max, a ruthless man bent on embroiling the world in a new high-tech global war.<br /><br />The Losers is based on the DC Vertigo graphic novel by Andy Diggle with illustrations by Jock. It is an action thriller but there are also a lot of strangely bent and humorous moments, mostly provided by Jensen (Chris Evans), the designated comic relief, but the rest of the cast also get in a zinger or two. The scene where Clay (JMD) and Aisha meet--ostensibly a hook up but actually Aisha knows exactly who Clay is and is recruiting him--is amazing. It is smokin' hot, if you like fighting as foreplay, and Clay and Aisha definitely do.<br /><br />---------------<br />Aisha: [whistles at the sight of Clay's Bolivian hotel room] Wow. It's everything a girl can dream of. Do you have a bathroom?<br />Clay: No, I specifically requested the only hotel room in the world that doesn't have a bathroom.<br />==========<br /><br />Jeffrey Dean Morgan was in Watchmen, and this scene reminds me of a similar one between Nite Owl II and Silk Spectere II. Hard to say which scene is my favorite, but they are both intense. Jeffrey Dean Morgan was also Denny Duquette on Grey's Anatomy, but after two great performances in Watchmen and The Losers, he is exonerated and his stint on Grey's is expunged from his record.<br /><br />---------------------------<br />Roque: Okay, you stay with us. But if anything smells like a trap, I get to put a bullet in your skull. Does that sound fair?<br />Aisha: That sounds fun.<br />Jensen: Sounds like my parents...<br />=============<br /><br />Aisha is played to perfection by Zoë Salda&ntilde;a. She was Neytiri in Avatar, Nyota Uhura in 2009's Star Trek, Anamaria in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, and Laila in Drumline. But what really impresses me is that she was in 2002's Crossroads with Britney Spears. That film also had a Grey's Anatomy connection in that it was written by Shonda Rhimes, the creator and head writer of Grey's. But Zoë has a beautiful body, so we won't hold that against her. Zoë Salda&ntilde;a is beautiful and talented and her star is definitely on the rise.<br /><br />---------------------------------<br />Clay: Jensen, are we wired?<br />Jensen: [disguised as a street vendor] Max is westbound... and these hot dogs are *delicious!*<br />=============<br /><br />Chris Evans as Jensen was brilliant. As Johnny Storm in The Fantastic Four he was also a stand out, a perfect mix of cocky self assurance and self deprecating mockery. Great rapport/tension between Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm, too. It's clobberin' time! As Jensen, Chris Evans was my favorite Loser (Zoë Salda&ntilde;a wasn't an actual Loser, so Evans wins).<br /><br />---------------------------<br />Clay: Whatta you have on her?<br />Jensen: Besides a pant-bustin' crush? Her Company file is blank. CIA has a standing kill order on her, as does Hamas, Sinn Fein... pretty much everyone with the exception of PETA wants this chick am-scrayed.<br />=============<br /><br />Roque, Pooch and Cougar may be Losers, but they are no slouches. And did I mention Jason Patric as the evil Max? Does anyone remember him as Michael in The Lost Boys? He was an excellent villian in The Losers. He was on par with Sam Rockwell in Iron Man II, or Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom in Fantastic Four.<br /><br />------------------------<br />Roque: Come, on, Clay! Look around you. I mean, do you think we're in a position to actually take on some CIA super-spook?<br />Clay: Roque...<br />Roque: It's a hell of a plan. You know what? Pooch could set up over there by the taco stand, and Jensen could set up communications right there by the hookers.<br />============<br /><br />The Bottom Line is that The Losers was a very entertaining film with great action and special effects sequences, but it also offered character development, both comedic and dramatic. This film came out before the remake of The A-Team and the Sylverster Stallone vehicle, The Expendables. I just saw the trailers for those other two films, but can't imagine that either film was as good as The Losers. Don't know why The Losers didn't do better at the box office. Got the feeling that A Team was a botched effort, but Expendables may have been worth a watch just for the cast of action heros, both young and old. The Losers was a tightly written action movie with some laughs along the way and at least one very sexy scene. It had everything you could ask for in a movie of this genre. Zoë Salda&ntilde;a won my heart, but Chris Evans was my favorite Loser.<br /><br />---------------------------<br />Roque: [Seeing Jenson's Pink Petunia shirt] Am I the only one who sees this shirt?<br />Jensen: Oh, yeah.

1400052173|4.0|This is a fascinating, compelling, amazing true story brought to life by science writer Rebecca Skloot. It veers back for forth between a journalistically-styled profile of Henrietta Lacks, whose cancer cells were harvested without her consent and then used in anti-cancer research; and the first-person efforts by Skloot to connect with Lacks' children. It's here that the story loses some of its momentum and power. In the end, I believe that Skloot achieved her goal of doing right by Lacks and faithfully telling her story. But I think the author gets too close to her subject and in that sense the narrative loses something.
B0033TJATW|5.0|This is a 'must have' for all MJ fans!    I must say though, it was not what I expected.    It was 1000X BETTER!!  From the moment it started, I could not take my eyes off of Michael.  Concert footage, videos, story-line, and Michael's beaming smile.  What more could you ask for?  Moonwalker is definitely a collector's item.  Beautiful ~ Beautiful ~ Beautiful  :)  RIP Michael Joseph Jackson  :'(  I purchased Moonwalker from we-got-the-beats, through Amazon and, I received my order promptly and in perfect condition.    If you don't already own Moonwalker, what are you waiting for??    Get your copy now, before they're all gone.
B001H5X7I4|1.0|.... or any other adjective you care to embellish upon this travesty. \\"TROPIC THUNDER\\" is the most desensitizing, degrading excursion into the realm of film-making I've ever witnessed. With the obvious target audience being young men and teenage boys, it will be sadly interesting how many psychotherapist's journals in decades to come will have reason to enumerate the long-term effects of \\"TROPIC THUNDER\\" on the psyches of the young and once-young, precipitated by this cinematic free-fall  into a foul-mouthed, mind-numbing vortex of ghastly depraved graphics (while for 106 minutes \\"innocently\\" cloaked and selling itself as a \\"humorous spoof\\").<br /><br />I didn't like this \\"humorous spoof\\" movie.<br /><br />Not-at-all.

0767903862|5.0|Bryson is one of my favorite authors and he does not disappoint in In a Sunburned Country!
B003W5C0VM|5.0|I have seen this movie in various forms through the years - typically copies of copies of bootleg copies of bootlegs. Last night I saw the remastered film in the theater (it was released for a one-night-only showing), and it blew me away. The sound was as perfect as a 1972 concert can be, and the video was superb - FAR better than any version I've seen before. This is highly recommended for anybody who calls themselves Stones Fans, and is absolutely essential for anybody who was at any of the 1972 US shows.<br /><br />No doubt I'm still somewhat euphoric after having just seen it in a theater, but this might be - MIGHT BE - the best rock and roll concert film every done. No fluff, no background info, no personality profiles - just one hell of a rock concert by a band at the absolute height of their powers. I've seen the Stones many times, and always felt this tour was by far the best. After last night, now I'm sure of it. A brief show by today's standards, on a small stage (the players are very close together), with period lighting, and the band starts with a bang and it only gets better from there. There's an incredible amount of energy on that stage, and more than a little bit of controlled chaos. God, it's freaking PERFECT!<br /><br />It is pieced from four performances, so there's no clothing continuity at all, but who cares? Jagger has glitter on his face, Keith is playing unbelievable riffs, and Mick Taylor demonstrates why he's probably the most overlooked and underrated rock/blues guitarist who ever walked the planet. Wyman stands stock still (how does he do that), and Charlie Watts wears funny clothes and nails that backbeat like only he can.<br /><br />Get this DVD. Don't even think about not getting it.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|I bought this movie after watching Oprah. I was surprised to see how the federal government hides what we eat and how it processed. Get this movie you will change how and what your eat. TRUST ME I have.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|so pleased with the way amazon conducts pre-orders, I'll never buy a DVD any other way.
B000002IPZ|3.0|The story behind Souls of Black really explains why it is only three stars.  The group was forced to wrap up it's recording as quick as possible so they could be a part of a big tour, so it was rushed.  The result is that what could have rivaled the first two comes of as a half-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA effort.  \\"Malpractice\\" is just a sickening song.  \\"The Legacy\\" ends up being a really amazing, and very well written ballad.  \\"Face In the Sky\\" and \\"Souls of Black\\" are awesome thrash monster songs, with interesting riffs, the latter having a sweet bass intro.  Yet when it is all said and done, you feel like there are too few good riffs spread about the songs for them to have a full album.  Had this been an EP it would be heralded as great, but to their own detriment they threw in a bunch of filler to make a whole album.
B003QCCS36|5.0|Exactly what I would expect from a Ray cd, plus some twang. Full of beautiful, emotion filled songs that grab you and don't let go. There's also a few kick ass funky jams book ending the mix.
B0019M06JS|5.0|I did not know anything about her until I saw a review for this album.  Her voice isn't superior by itself, but in this setting, and on these songs and with these arrangements, it's wonderful. The melodies and arrangements on \\"Superwoman\\" alone make the CD worthwhile for me, but I like the other tracks too.  The non-latin traditional songs fit very well with bossa nova rhythms in this collection.  Like someone else said, if you like Diana Krall and bossa nova, you will love this album.  The fact that she's gorgeous has nothing to do with it, unless you want to imagine she's singing to you.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|Completely disappointed when it arrived on my doorstep.  I thought it would be a little bigger.  I needed it for a time sensitive trip, so I loaded some equipment in it and kept it.  It's not the worst bag I have ever owned, but it is definitely NOT a two body bag, and the padding is too thin on the outsides for a quality camera bag.  If you're shooting an entry level DSLR, this bag is fine, but I wouldn't trust it with a full framer and pricey glass for long term use.  The price makes it attractive, and it is somewhat functional, but if you're expecting to be pleasantly surprised...  You're probably going to be let down.
B00133KF26|4.0|Fragile Art of Existence is so close to being a five star album in my humble opinion.  I hate to gripe over a vocalist considering how Chuck was admittedly not the best vocalist on the Death albums, but I feel like Tim just misses the mark on here.  There were many moments where I always enjoyed his contributions, but on the whole I never fully grew to appreciate his vocals.  Now taking into account I have had this one for at least a good six or seven years, and his vocals have still not fully \\"grown on me\\", I give this four stars without reservation.  Now the fact that I feel like I have to justify why I am not giving a Chuck album less then five stars should tell you something about the kind of musician he was.  Get his Death albums, and get this one expecting to be satisfied, that is how good Chuck was.

B003W5C0VW|5.0|Saw Ladies and Gentlemen last night, and was not disappointed in what I remember from 30+ years ago. Definitely biggest highlight was the sound. Theater was playing second disc of just released Exile cd, and when the movie proper kicked in you could feel the surround sound and volume go up several notches. Unlike the bootleg copy I've been watching the last 15 years you could hear Nicky Hopkins, Bill Wyman, Charlie, and both guitars playing off each other. (and feel the bottom end) I agree that both the focus and the lighting both were not what we are used to seeing in movies of the last 30 years or so. I think a lot of that had to do with when this was made. The lighting for this tour was pretty advanced for its time (huge mylar mirror hanging above and in front of the stage with giant spots behind the band shining behind and reflecting back at them). Probably not the best for shooting a movie. I agree a lot of the lighting was focused on Mick, and that was probably intentional at the time. But again, this makes the bootleg dvd look like a black and white silent movie. (not that I haven't enjoyed it)<br /><br />Highlights from the movie were Tumbling Dice, especially the end with Keith, Charlie and Bill building that groove that you wish would go on for another 10 minutes, with Mick T. adding his special flourishes to it. Midnight Rambler that is as good as or better than the Ya Ya's version, because here the lighting during the mid section highlighting the tension of the song, and then when the whole band kicks in at the end with the whole stage lighting up works better than any million dollar stage and lighting has worked over the last 30 years. And last the last 3rd of the concert, starting with Midnight Rambler, and going thru Bye, Bye Johnny, Rip this Joint, (with Mick telling the audience they've been sitting on their a**es long enought), Jumpin' Jack Flash (where the house lights kick up and you get to see the crowd, for the first time, going crazy), and Street Fighting Man is what takes this from a great rock and roll concert movie to the GREATEST rock and roll movie of all time.<br /><br />Three minor disappointments, when I went to this last night, there were only about 10 people in the theater. This was good because we were center theater, getting great sound with nobody around us, but made me a little sad that this might be an era of rock that isn't appreciated for what it was. Second, the bonus features that were on the origninal Fathom news release for this were not shown (the Montreux rehearsal footage, and the Old Grey Whistle test footage). Hopefully, they're on the DVD. Lastly, when I saw this in the mid 70s, I remember the theater lights going down, and nothing but a black screen, with background noise, and little blurbs of very occasional lights until you saw people going on stage and you heard the announcer say, Ladies and Gentlemen, The Rolling Stones. Now you have Eagle Rock Presents, and Ladies and Gentlemen breaking that up. All these did not diminish the fact that this lived up to the memories of this from almost 35 years ago.<br /><br />I've went on too long. Seeing this again after 3 plus decades got me pretty fired up. Hopefully, the sound and improvement in picture can be transfered to DVD. (along with the bonus stuff that wasn't there last night.) This is THE GREATEST ROCK AND ROLL CONCERT MOVIE ever made.ting Man is what takes this from a great rock and roll concert movie to the GREATEST rock and roll movie of all time.

B0012E6R3W|2.0|Everything about this album reeks, the production, the vocals, the guitar riffs, even the return of Alex does not help.  The occasional cool riff or interesting lead line does not conceive a good album.  They sacrificed what made them good on \\"The Gathering\\" nearly a decade earlier, to entice Skolnick to return, because he no doubt would have refused to solo over an album like that.  The result is a \\"thrash comeback\\" that seems as forced and inept as it's sister turd, \\"Death Magnetic\\".  What a disappointment.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Though notorious crime comedy director Guy Ritchie takes liberties with Doyle's exact words, he shows loyalty to Doyle's intent in this spirited Holmes remix.  The \\"Snatch\\" director and Madonna satellite tells a story similar to, but different from, Barry Levinson's 1985 pastiche [[ASIN:B0000AUHPC Young Sherlock Holmes]], leavened with Ritchie's droll wit and swashbuckling action.  Though Holmes movie purists may balk, readers will see plenty of their familiar detective on screen.    Holmes (Robert Downey, Jr.) and Watson (Jude Law) agree to solve one last case, since Watson means to wed.  (Veteran readers know how Watson's marriages fare.  Both times.  Watch for the aftermath in sequels.)  They handily defeat occultist Lord Blackwood, played by Mark Strong, whose resemblance to Basil Rathbone can't be coincidence.  But when Blackwood survives the gallows, bringing him in becomes Holmes' chief obsession.  Until, that is, Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) and her assorted baggage burst back into his life.    Through telling detail and sly anachronism, Ritchie depicts London straddling tradition and technology, superstition and reason, the Nineteenth Century and the Twentieth.  Holmes must cross and recross these lines several times.  The physical design plays as much of a role as the actors.  Cultural markers like a half-built Tower Bridge, street scenes inspired by Whistler's paintings, and ornate fight choreography, set an operatic tone that the performers fill splendidly.    Downey plays much the same hyperkinetic personality that drove him in \\"Iron Man,\\" with a flawless fake accent.  He remains as incisive, and arrogant, as prior Holmeses (especially Jeremy Brett) but Downey and Ritchie restore Doyle's vision of Holmes as a crafty pugilist and crack shot, largely written out of prior screen versions.  Jude Law as straight man perfectly complements Downey, keeping Holmes' manic mannerisms from overwhelming audiences weaned on more dour portrayals.    Little cues signalthat Ritchie sees this film as the start of a franchise.  I'd watch the sequels.  Downey makes the best Holmes since the late Jeremy Brett, probably because he's the first to not mimic Brett's performance.  The rococo design and larger-than-life performances accord with what current movie audiences expect, without spoiling the story.  And, in sum, the movie tells a fun action story worthy of the Sherlock Holmes title.
B000002LUB|5.0|So it goes Dehumanizer's opening track, Computer God. Released in 1992 when computers were beginning to take over us poor humans, this album just keeps growing both lyrically and musically. Dio's visionary lyrics are as good as it gets here.<br /><br />Sound wise, it basically blows up the speakers! Heavy and dark but not noisy. Tony and Geezer are in top form all through the album and Vinny Appice is solid.<br /><br />I guess the highlights would be the aforementioned Computer God, After All (The Dead), Letters From Earth, Master Of Insanity, and the slow one Too Late. But as classic albums go, all songs are worth listening to and make up for a great sonic experience.<br /><br />Don't miss it if you've dug Heaven And Hell and Mob Rules for, even though it was recorded a decade after, Dehumanizer is - without a doubt - a great sequel in the Sabbath-Dio saga!
1594481717|5.0|Don't let the ugly cover design fool you. This book is packed with ideas that will get your creative juices flowing! I love the Exercises (called Portfolio) at the end of each chapter. He also has a lot to say to medical students and professionals about the power of Empathy!
B00000IMTF|5.0|There is just something about this album.  It is my favorite album with Dio involved.  Sure his solo albums \\"Holy Diver\\" and \\"Last In Line\\" were great.  This is just in another level.  His stint with Sabbath producing both \\"Heaven and Hell\\" and \\"Mob Rules\\" come close to the greatness of this, but they lose points for containing filler, while this comes off as the perfect listening experience.  Every song is amazing.  It is almost hard to talk about an album like this because I find it easier to complain about things I don't like then praise what I do.  Let's not forget Ritchie Blackmore, that guy was something else on the guitar.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I enjoyed this book. Interesting and fun to read. Not deep and meaningful but excellent entertainment!
B00005NG9Z|4.0|When I bought this DVD, I just wanted to watch Alice´s clips.  The DVD delivers much more, as each song is remixed in 5.1. Even though the mix is not top notch, it does add some depth to the songs and the whole experience is very interesting.   It also features some behind the scenes footage, but I got nothing to say about it.  I deducted one star as the DVD menu is kinda stubborn and never does what you want.
1400062756|5.0|I've been following Dweck's research since the late 90's and Self Theories.  That book was excellent but a little heavy on research for anyone who isn't information-driven.    This new book is very readable, full of research besides her own and uses anedotal real-life examples.  I recommend this book to parents who want to motivate their children and of course to school officials as a means to avoid \\"dancing the lemons\\" a term coined by the Benmwood Foundation.    But my suggestion after nearly 40 years as a CEO is that anyone running any type of organization or boards of directors who want growth-oriented leadership, should use this book to help screen for out people with a fixed mindset and suck the producitivty out of any enterprise.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|I have purchased other Invicta watches all for around 100 dollars each and none come close to the Speedway. Taking it out of the box, I was surprised with the heft of the watch. It keeps 100% accurate time, and the only two complaints I have is that the second hand doesn't always fall on the second markers, and that Invicta doesn't make the Speedway with a mechanical movement.     That aside, this was a great purchase, it far exceeded my expectations. I haven't taken it off since.

B004289ZW0|3.0|Ordered it three days ago, with an expected delivery date of 10/04 to 11/01.  Got it today (three days after order), very surprised.  Installation on my WiFi iPad was trivial, as per the user manual.  Immediately got a solid GPS lock on the second floor of my three story house.  Works just fine with Google Maps.  Problems began when I tried to download other software to interface with it.  So far, all GPS Apps I've tried refuse to install, saying they're not compatible with my iPad.  Apple support is clueless, saying that the manufacturer claim that the hardware is Apple approved is not true.  They say I need to contact the software vendors to report installation issues.  Am giving GNS the benefit of the doubt - it's a new device, and it's not unreasonable to get a few bumps in the road early on.  I bought this device because I didn't want to go through the hassles of jailbreaking my iPad (warranty, support, questionable software, etc), and this was the only other option to get GPS support.  Will report back once I find a software solution, and perhaps add stars...

B001OQCV6A|5.0|I read Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's books and enjoyed them and I watched this movie and enjoyed it no less then book. Movie does not follow all perspectives of book but it shouldn't. Movie made in modern action like manner with elements of comedy and Robert Downey is right actor for this role. I have classical book, movies and I swear I would not buy one more same old classical movie which in the modern world would look boring.   I enjoyed this movie, watched it several times with my family and gonna buy it on blu ray now.     PS Sherlock Holmes is collective character and does not have to look only on the way as Conan Doyle described him. Great movie. It is a one of the ways what entertainment should be.
0316098337|5.0|This is undoubtedly one of the best, if not the best novel I have ever read in my life. I read it in 8 hours straight, feeling incredibly guilty when I had to put it down to reach for the tissues every now and then. Don't let the initial tone discourage you in any way, though the story is told from a 5 year old's point of view, it could never have been more immaculate had it been written differently. I've never encountered such bare innocence as Jack's, and so many times I felt like I wasn't reading the book at all, but rather completely immersed in the story, wanting to reach Jack and Ma, or scream as loud as I could to get somebody to help them.    I couldn't possibly recommend this book more. If you have the slightest bit of compassion, this book is for you.

B002ZG9846|4.0|The great thing about movies that enter the realm of super heroes is that nothing is over the top. Anything goes, and that is precisely why I read them on a weekly basis while growing up. The sixties were a different era of course, and I could only afford new books on Saturday. But I spent the entire afternoon reading them. It was a time to let the imagination roam unfettered. Time would seem as if suspended while you studied and imagined the world beyond a single frame or page. So with `Kick-Ass', I did exactly as I did so many years ago. Open it up, sit back and hopefully, watch in awe.<br /><br />The movie opens slowly, and a foundation is laid out. This is very important due to many not having read the `Kick-Ass' series. I had never heard of it. But the premise intrigued me and that was enough. So, in a sense, I was back to the Saturday afternoon atmosphere of seeing things for the first time, as they unfolded. And unfold they did.<br /><br />The rise of `Kick-Ass' was due to frustration with the status-quo. You don't have to be into comics to understand this. However, it is the second ingredient to becoming `Kick-Ass' (courage) that is uncommon. So young Dave (Aaron Johnson) has decided to change his world and the catalyst is the comic book super hero world he lives for. He creates an alter-ego `Kick-Ass' and sets out to make a difference in his world. Along the way, he'll meet allies, adversaries and find that recognition can be a two-edged sword.<br /><br />Each page of `Kick-Ass' yields additions to the film that are a surprise and very welcome. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is fine as the ignored son of the local mob boss (Mark Strong) who reckons he'll be reckoned with one way or another. Nicholas Cage plays a comic book writer who has the added task of raising a daughter (Chloe Grace Moretz) alone. Chloe is a young dynamo who also happens to steal the movie (apologies to all the talent assembled, she is that good). I'm not getting into the characters here because you really need to watch the movie and let the story evolve.<br /><br />The film is based on the Mark Millar comic book series. The writers worked closely with Millar . And for their efforts to bring forth a fresh and lively story to an old genre, writer Jane Goldman and writer-director, Matthew Vaughn have succeeded wildly. Oh and there will be more of these movies to come, that you can be sure of. After all, there's a charismatic thirteen year old girl who simply must entertain the world, one more time before getting back to school.atch the movie and let the story evolve.

0553805371|5.0|I am a big fan of \\"Fringe\\", the TV-Series on FOX. That TV Series shows a series of events happening in our world, which are related to a disturbances brought about because of interaction with an alternate world. It can be read on wikipedia at: [...]    So coming from there, I was really very interested and caught by this book. Reading this book makes me think that \\"Fringe\\" is really possible.     The book lays down some basic questions at the beginning, like : Why is there something rather than nothing? When and how did the universe begin? Why are we here?    It builds upon theory of relativity and quantum mechanics to make a case for a super theory called M-theory. It talks about how there can be many universes, and not just one based on this.     Some pointer ideas I remember from reading the book, which will interest you, I am trying to say in English, obviously I am not hawking :)  - Each and every way an event can happen will happen with a certain probability.  - Any event can be predicted if we can do a summation of all probabilities from a past to that event.   - An action you take in the present may affect the past.  - Universes can be formed out of nothing, without requiring any intervention.  - The existence of God is not necessary for Life. (This is controversial, I am just stating my interpretation of the book, not my belief). But let me tell you, the book is not at all insulting or imposing this on anyone, it is just a view based on some scientific analysis.  - Laws of Nature that can sustain life occur by pure chance, and may happen some where else too in the many planets in the many galaxies in the many universes.  - There is nothing like a pure Unified Theory of everything, but M Theory comes close.  - There is nothing like absolute truth, it all depends on the observer. A simple example, for you on the plane, if you hurl up a ball and catch it, it might be just a slow motion thing, but for someone on the ground, it was very fast.    Happy reading! It is very enjoyable, and not too highly scientific. You can run through parts which sound highly technical or scientific and not miss the main idea of the book.
B002ZG98UA|1.0|Well, once again they stunk it up. Please, this crud of talking into a flipping video camera has got to stop! The storyline is so trite, having to do with Alice's powers, that I wanted to wretch! I loved the first R.E. and the 2nd was still o.k., but, these last two have just been awful. There were some highlights in the storyline, and there were some good ideas presented, but once again they have done a disservice to the series. I hope you enjoy it, and not feel like me. Who knows, maybe I expect too much. Remember, Shoot Em In The Head! Bring on W.W. Z!<br /><br />P.S. Milla and Ali are smokin hot!
B0000009TT|5.0|I bought this album with an air of giddy excitement compareable only to that of a raging necrophiliac in an unsupervised morgue.  Over three hours of music in one package.  everything from the silly and grotesque Zappa lyrics we all know and love to the prolific and hard-rocking instrumentals.  This album has quickly became one of my favorites among my collection.
B002ZG977Y|2.0|In comparison to the original about the only thing going for this one are the special effects.  There were some plot holes in the tale and story pieces didn't connect well.

I am an advocate for holistic health and wellness and believe our children should be shown this at school and parents should watch it at home with their children so healthy decisions can collectively be made out food choices for great health.  Knowledge is power!  With knowledge we can emphasize to the food industry (with our buying power) what we will and will not tolerate in and about our foods.  Otherwise we are just like unknowing animals being led to a death sentence of bad health, diseases and death.  I will share this with all I know.
B003E48AYC|5.0|A very interesting movie to the point I have to go back and read the book to determine if some of the characters i.e. the \\"white queen\\" is in the original story or an addition to this movie. Like the live action characters alongside the animation. This movie also brings home the \\"dark side\\" of the \\"queen of hearts\\" only hinted at in the original all animation movie of several years ago. The added features to the blu-ray re: the making of the movie and the movement of the characters was especially interesting. I believe these features really enhance the DVD format for all movies when they are included.

0765326353|5.0|This monstrous volume took me a good week or two but that's only because I have class, not for lack of want!    On the magic system, it's always a pleasure when magic has a limited source to draw from, as limitations make it more real in my eyes. After being exposed to a couple of magic systems in this book, I'm happy to say that they're all related in someway, so the 20+ magic systems Sanderson has been mentioning will fit cohesively (rather than a chaotic mix of 20 different systems).    Moving on to the epic-fantasy genre aspect of this book, all three main storylines were extremely well balanced. One of my biggest pet peeves with epic-fantasy is the tendency for one storyline to rapidly outpace the others, making it almost a chore to read through the minor storylines just to get to the more exciting ones. In tWoK, I was content with where I was at all times, never feeling a need to speed through to get to another part. I feel this was accomplished because Sanderson understood that sometimes the action dies down in a particular subplot and so did not try to stick with a strict pattern of storyline hopping. It just felt much more natural, and the novel didn't lose any momentum (except where it was intended =).    Another aspect I enjoyed was that as separate each storyline was, there was just enough cohesion to allow the reader to see they were part of the same world. What I'm saying is that the characters are not just shut off in their own little subsection of the planet, doing their own little thing. There are tentative connections that hint at the greater story, which was really pleasing.    My final point is about the ending. Anyone who has read the Mistborn Trilogy will know that Sanderson is a master at providing a deeply satisfying conclusion, still provide setup for the next books, yet all WITHOUT using obnoxious cliffhangers. This is a very humanitarian thing to do, as readers are able to wait in anticipation for the next volume without being tortured so.I was somewhat doubtful he could pull it off with the first book of 10, but ohh the end was just as masterful as those of the Mistborn books--twists, action, and plenty of suspense and tension.    Sanderson has provided no end of entertainment with this book, and the best thing is that with a 1000+ pager, you can safely reread it again and again and STILL be in awe every time.
B002K79GZG|3.0|This used hard back book came to me in great shape and it is a great story, but the book cover was missing.  I did not realize the book would come without a cover.
B003HN7BYA|5.0|I'll be honest with you. There really isn't alot of difference between this version and the original regarding sound. The guitars sound better and the volume is a little louder. Other then that there isn't a whole lot of difference.     The one thing that does stand out more in this one then the original is the two extra discs. For the price it is really a good deal. It has everything from live to demos. It also has some notes from the three remaining band members about the creation of the album. All in all, if you liked this album then you can't go wrong.    As far as the album itself there really is no point in reviewing it. I'm sure you've already heard this album numerous times so I'll spear you
0316098337|5.0|This is one of the most profound books I've ever read... I picked it up after work, read it straight through till midnight, and started again at 5:30am until I finished it.  It's hard to describe - yes it's like \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" yes it's got features of current events - but I have never read anything like this.  Maybe being a mom to a boy a bit younger than Jack is what made the way Jack sees his world ring so true.  Very, very powerful book about what reality and freedom mean.

B003U0AHBO|4.0|Robin Hood is the pre-story...the story of Robin Hood's journey to his calling.<br /><br />Fans of epic, war or love stories should end up liking the introductory Robin Hood (and his merry men) as much as I did, though. And I would like to see a sequel with the telling of the classic Robin Hood story and there was a nice set up for that to happen.<br /><br />Marion and Robin's storyline is sweet and should satisfy women who detest \\"guy\\" movies. There are battle scenes but they are played out in fast forward clashes that are not horrifically violent because there is so much going on and it moves so fast that the violence is mostly flickers and images.<br /><br />Content Warning: Most of this film is older kid friendly but there is a scene toward the beginning of the movie that is uncomfortably sexual between Prince John, his lover and his mother. A bit creepy.
0439023513|1.0|I was disappointed in this third book of the trilogy.  The story moved very slowly and did not have the \\"cliff-hanger\\" endings as in The Hunger Games.  Katniss was no longer an interesting character and Peeta was barely there.  Prim and her mother did not have much of a part in this book.  The Hunger Games was five stars; Catching Fire was a mediocre three stars and Mockingjay is a lowly one star. Bummer.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|I'm just going to have to admit I'm a Robert Downey Jr. fan. In Sherlock Holmes he plays a quirky, borderline mad scientist, genius in the title role. The casting for the film was perfect. Jude Law is exceptional as the uptight and torn Dr. Watson.<br /><br />The mystery is creative and nicely twisted. Sarcastic modernesque dialog and character interaction that ebbs and flows from love, hate, bitterness, wistfulness and true friendship and back makes this film a rich character piece as well as entertaining fun.<br /><br />The action sequences are stunning, too, employing fast forward and slow motion segments that keep the viewer's mind hopping. Though this style is used in more and more films, Ritchie makes this quirky, choppy style work exceptionally well in Holmes.<br /><br />Overall this is a family friendly movie. However, sensitive kids would likely have some trouble with some truly creepy scenes. There are elements of the occult and easily frightened kids will probably be spooked by several scenes.
B0029LX2LC|5.0|Learned of The Roots on the Jimmy Fallon Show, they are his house band.  I was so impressed and ordered their new CD. Though rap-type music is not what I usually listen too, the  Roots have a beautiful message done in a wonderfully, professional way.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|Invictus is more about the heart of President Nelson Mandela rather than the Bokks rugby team. This film paints a beautiful picture of forgiveness, courage and the strength that comes from choosing to walk the high road with dignity. Two of the people I viewed the movie with thought there was a lack of action. I tend to like slower character pieces so that may be why I liked the movie more than they did. There are moments where the film clips along and is about Rugby, but Invictus is not just a pure feel good sports movie -- its bigger than that. Note for parents. A few characters drop the F-Bomb but with their accents it's muted. This story is one that older kids should watch because it is inspiring and powerful and it stresses the humanity and beauty in each of us regardless of skin color, ability or language.

0786955570|5.0|As an owner of the game, I discovered that Castle Ravenloft is the perfect game for when my regular pen and paper d20 group is missing a player. No Gm, no prep time, no bringing a dozen books, no pencil or note keeping, just a simple night of d20 without all the paper, dice and books spread out on the table. (Yes, the pizza and beer still takes up just as  much room as it does any other night. If your group loves D20, this is a great alternative. You will learn the rules quickly, because you already know most of them, and all the prep takes is getting the stuff out of the box.  The only criticism I have with the game is that the figs are not painted and it doesn't come with a plano storage box or card boxes (I use a card tin from Magic. I doubt that I will buy the second game that is being released in December because one is enough, and while story line is different, the point of this board game is not story as much as it is a random unknown dungeon crawl.
B00371QQ2U|5.0|This is a fantastic Blu-ray with a great transfer and sound.  Aside from some dated special effects everything looks realistic and it sucks you right in.  Highly recommend this for any blu-ray collection.

0765356147|5.0|WOW!!!  Everything you thought you knew from the last few books is turned upside down.  Hero of Ages answers all the questions and riddles brought up in the first two books.    The ending was very unexpected.    I recommend this book.  It blew me away.
1416972250|5.0|The first was good, the second better and the third the very best.  In my previous review of City of Bones I was torn.  Now I realize what a wonderful series this is.    The beginning starts off with the shadowhunters leaving for Idris.  Determined to leave Clary behind, Jace by misfortune takes Simon-an downworlder-with him.  Not to be outdone Clary finds her own way to get into Idris-taking Luke-another downworlder-with her.    From the very beginning of the book, there are new complications.  Clary is staying with an old friend, Simon is in jail, and Jace and the lightwoods are staying with friend-one of them the mysterious Sebastien.  From the moment Clary sees him she feels as if she has known him for a long time.      While attempting to save her mother, Clary and Jace manage to discover some very horrible truths.  Ones that will change the shadowhunters forever.    Soon a war breaks out with Valentine right in the middle of it-still thriving.     As for the romance department, I think you all will be quite satisfied with the results.    A great read-one you do not want miss.
B003KUSUN6|5.0|I grew up with The Shadows music, they put on this final show as good as any they have performed in the past, a true credit to their ability and musical tallent. The icing on the cake would have been Cliff doing a number with them. Without a doubt it was a FIVE star show.
0385528752|5.0|I. Love. This. Book.  To start out with, I'm going to give it the best compliment I can:  The writing style and subject matter reminds me of Malcolm Gladwell.<br /><br />The Heath brothers break down making changes and direction actions and motivations into three different categories.  They discuss the elephant - your impulsive or emotional self, the rider (of the elephant) - your rational self, and the path - the route to the change or activity you wish to make.  Then for each section they deliver delightfully simple moves that you can make to facilitate changes.  For each of the chapters, they deliver examples from the real world to illustrate their points.  This book doesn't just deal in the mundane world of psychology - it hits you with real actions you can take.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this book is highly entertaining and extremely instructive.  I feel like each chapter helped to equip me with tools that I can actually use.  The number of \\"aha!\\" moments was through to roof!  Great book!

B002ZG99NG|5.0|Until a few years ago Ben Affleck definitly had his ups and downs. Whether it be in tabloids or mediocre movies he never seemed to be making a positive impact on film (though I'll admit to being one of the only people who liked Daredevil). Then a few years ago he gave a fantastic performance in 'Hollywood Land' and wrote and directed the entertaining and thought-provoking crime thriller 'Gone Baby Gone'. 'The Town' (in my opinion) is not only his best film as both director and actor, it's one of the most entertaining and engaging crime films I've ever seen!<br /><br />The plot of 'The Town' is pretty bare bones: Armed Robbers from Charlestown (a suburb of Boston, MA with a violent reputation) steal from a bank and take a bank teller (Rebecca Hall) hostage. After letting her go, their leader Doug (Affleck) trails her to find out what she knows about them and at the same time starts a relationship with her. There's also an FBI agent (Jon Hamm) on their trail. While this is pretty much the plot of the story it's what we learn about each character and how growing up and living in Charlestown has effected their lives. I read Charles Hogan's novel 'Prince of Thieves' (which this film is based) a while ago but as good as it was it never gripped you the way this film does.<br /><br />The directing in 'The Town' is masterful. The heist scenes are exciting and never too drawn out and the action is very level-headed without losing the excitement. To add to this and some great character interaction scenes Affleck uses real locations to add to the authentic feel of the setting. Our protagonist visits community centers and meetings that add a flavor to 'The Town' other Boston-based films like 'The Departed' and 'Mystic River' were lacking.<br /><br />The casting and acting couldn't be better and fits the movie perfectly. Ben Affleck creates a memorable and sympathetic protagonist in Doug, even as we see him do some violent things. Rebecca Hall is both intelligent and strong as Claire the Bank teller who falls for Doug. Jeremy Renner is dynamite as Jem, Doug's life-long friend who's a loose cannon but is a fully fleshed out character. Jon Hamm sheds his 'Mad Men' image and creates an FBI agent who's just as ruthless and tough as the criminals he's after. Chris Cooper has a brief but memorable role as Doug's father. Blake Lively, Pete Postlethwaite, and Titus Welliver also contribute strong performances.<br /><br />The extended version of The Town is about 30 minutes longer has a few fun scenes with Jem and Doug, and draws out Claire and Doug's relationship. There's also a bit more about Jon Hamm and Blake Lively's characters and it extends some of the montages. None of these scenes seemed drastically necessary (most of them are in the first half of the film) but fans will definitely appreciate some of the more drawn out exposition.<br /><br />I really can't praise this movie enough. Ben Affleck created one of the most authentic-feeling crime films with 'Gone Baby Gone' but he has not only topped that but managed to make 'The Town' as entertaining as it is an inside look at a community with a violent reputation. You may feel like you've seen this story before but rarely has it been told this well.aire the Bank teller who falls for Doug.

0439023513|3.0|I love the first two books. I pre-ordered the third and started reading as soon as it came in the mail. I was really disappointed with the story. It did not hold up to the first two books. It lacked the drive the others had. I remember staying up all night to read and this book didn't have that. Not a bad book to read, just not what I expected to end the hunger games.
0767817478|1.0|Those 5 and 4 star reviews are from people that never watch Godzilla and have no idea what Godzilla is or what it's about. Those 3 star reviews are confused people who can't quite understand why they did or did not like this movie. The 1 and 2 star reviews of this film are people that grew up on Godzilla and know that they just got scammed big time by Hollywood. This movie has nothing to do with Godzilla and certainly isn't about him at all. The creature doesn't even look like him or act like him. Godzilla laying eggs? What? What in the heck was that? Why is Godzilla always hiding in this film? Last time I checked he only went into the water to sleep or to  go home. He came on land so he could cure his boredom or to fight what ever monster that seemed to be getting on his nerves at the time. What is this mess? I'll tell you exactly what it is. Some writer came up with the idea about a lizard like creature that attacks NewYork. When he was done and submitted the other people in the room thought it didn't sound too original and the giant creature attacking a city reminded them of Godzilla... then the light bulb flashed! \\"Hey lets take this script and just make it a Godzilla film\\" The story won't have crap to do with Godzilla but hey at least we'll make a fortune off the ticket sales!<br /><br />..and there you have it the worst thing to happen to Godzilla since Mecha-Godzilla almost beat him to death.
B0002F6AH0|4.0|This series was always by far the best ever produced about the Second World War. It is excellent in every way. However, never, ever, should they have altered the original order of episodes. History should be told in the order in which it occured and not haphazardly as this set does. The new episodes they created for this DVD set should all have been at the end of the original series instead of being inserted among the original episodes and with the original episodes mixed up in their order.<br />Still, it is well worth the price because of it's historical value and the unique and very interesting film content, the excellent interviews, as well as Laurence Olivier's absolutely beautiful narration.<br />I will always treasure The World At War as I have now for 35 years.<br />Just four stars because of the alteration of the order of the original episodes.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Incredible  attention to detail along with fascinating characters we manage to find intriguing from the first show to the last, Mad Men stands out on many levels. Jon Hamm. One has to witness the perfection in his performance for themselves to really understand Don Draper and Jon Hamm's talent. Don is flawed, the 60's family is flawed and so plastic we wonder if they ever really existed? They did - I grew up during the 60's, and my mom looked like Betts.<br /><br />Beyond fun, Mad Men is a weekly retro trip that is education, unforgettable and totally engrossing.

B002KSPKRS|4.0|This product is great but with limitations.  This product arrived in time and was well packaged.  Sound is great and cutting off the leash from the base was a great idea.  One problem I've run into and could be a deal breaker, is interference from wifi.  I was downloading a large file from my wireless router to my laptop for about 30 minutes.  The whole 30 minutes the product was unusable.  That is inexcusable.  You will hear static and pops when wifi transmission is activated.
B00005JLRT|5.0|I like all the Star Trek TNG movies, but Nemesis was definitely the best of them all.  Was an interesting plot and a moving conclusion.  Definitely worth buying.
B003V5PPZG|1.0|I have to say I was not a big fan of Minutes to Midnight when it came out.  I gave it a sold chance and grew to love some of the songs but was worried that LP had decided to change their entire sound.  Upon the release of the Catalyst I grew hopeful that we were possibly hearing an edited down \\"sample\\" of what we could expect on the upcoming album...and while the early 90's keyboard synth sound wasn't standard LP fare I did like the vocals and even remember thinking this is going to be a great song when they release the final version with the actual drum and guitar tracks mixed back in....but that was all for not.    As mentioned above I was a harsh judge on my initial listening of their last major album MTM however after giving it time I grew to enjoy their decidedly more organic guitar rifs and back to basics sound.  I have given A Thousand Suns 10 good listens on each track and I have to say I have not found a single stand out track,no have I have found a single song that sounded like it belonged on a LP album. I have searched and still cannot find a single reason to suggest this album to anyone who expects to find their trade mark harsh deep sound.  I understand not wanting to retrace footsteps and the need to evolve as a band but the album contains too many useless intro and intermission tracks coupled with a late 80's vibe that reminds me of a t-pain remix song.  I bought what I thought would be 13-15 solid songs like the last three albums and received 8-9 full length songs none of which were of any note.      I am by no means a die hard fan but I do like to support bands that I enjoy listening too and this album has done nothing more but reinforce and further my a desire to pirate music first before purchasing.    Sorry LP, but this is one album that you should have released as a b-side along with a more substantial new album.

Seasons in the Abyss is one of Slayer's best recording albums and I totally recommend it for all you metalheads. The recent Slayer show I've gone to played the entire album and thought they sounded just as good live. I'm proud of my purchase and got it at a really good price.
0375413405|5.0|I learned how to cook by watching Ms. Julia Child on PBS. She has always been one of, if not my very favorite, TV cooking chef. Ms. Child's on-air recipes were always so practical and forgiving because she not only gave recipes but also taught a method and had a wonderful attention to detail that has remained uncompromised.     Recently when Ms. Child's show was put back into rotation on The Cooking Channel I started watching her shows again and celebrating her recipes (she is truly the only cook that I can watch, get the method and make the dish without any complications, mistakes or a need for a paper recipe). And I was amazed to find that I did not have any of her cookbooks in my kitchen library. So I immediately decided to purchase her most famous cookbook (and her very first), \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking.\\"     The book was first published in 1961, is hard cover and a total of 684 pages in length. The book includes diagrams, pictures, as well as an index and a glossary.     And although I know my way around the kitchen, I have to admit that the book is somewhat intimidating. It is truly a wealth of information for absolutely everyone that appreciates the fine creation of French culinary cooking.     The contents of the book include chapters and sections on these topics: kitchen equipment, definitions (basic translations from French to American-English), ingredients (how to find some of the rather unusual items in American supermarkets and what to substitute), measures (or conversions), temperatures, cutting, wines (I don't drink, but even if you don't this is still handy to read because we all entertain), soups, sauces, eggs, entrees and luncheon dishes, fish, poultry, meat, vegetables, cold buffet, and desserts and cakes.     So far I have made a couple of the recipes from the poultry chapter and what I like about this book is that Ms. Child lays everything out so neatly and explicitly in each recipe. She even lists all of the utensils that will be needed for each dish.     This is would make a fantastic book for a new bride because it includes descriptive information on both serving and preparing lavish and basic dinners. I also recommend this book to both the amateur cook (like myself) as well as the longstanding professional because we can all learn something new about French cooking. And who better to teach us than the one and only Julia Child.

Michael, Vito's son is trying to make the family legitimate but has considerable difficulty with the conversion.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I've seen Larsson's trilogy sometime before I brought it on my Kindle, but I never thought it ws particularly interesting or appealing to me. After seeing the books being bestsellers here on Amazon for weeks and weeks, I finally couldn't resist and purchased The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.<br /><br />And my, what a stunning book. It does get off to a bit of a slow start, but the action and suspense picks up from halfway and is simply captivating. Although I anticipated the ending, the characters and their personalities which Larsson put into these characters really impressed me, and I could not resist purchasing the other two books of the trilogy also.<br /><br />If you enjoy thriller and mystery books, I would definitely recommend you to read this book and possibly the other books in the trilogy also.

0143034901|4.0|Dateline Barcelona 1945 shortly after WW II, location - a dingy, obscure side street north of the Mediterranean and just a block from the well known Rambla. Daniel Sempere is allowed to peek through the stacks of a very mysterious library that his father, himself an antiquarian book dealer, calls \\"The Cemetery of Forgotten Books\\". His father gives Daniel the cryptic directions,<br /><br />\\"According to tradition, the first time someone visits this place, he must choose a book, whichever he wants, and adopt it, making sure that it will never disappear, that it will always stay alive.

For life ... \\"<br /><br />Having chosen an obscure novel entitled \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" by one Juli&aacute;n Carfax, he subsequently makes the bizarre discovery that somebody is systematically destroying every copy of every book that Carax has ever written. And the requirement to murder someone standing in the way of this destruction doesn't seem to be holding the culprit back!<br /><br />To provide any details beyond the most basic plot premise is to do Carlos Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n's lucid, mellifluous prose and intricate plotting, not to mention any potential reader, a serious disservice. But this much can be said:<br /><br />THE SHADOW OF THE WIND is a superbly crafted literary historical mystery. Gothic overtones, almost ghostly atmospherics, love, lust, hate, heroism, bravery, dysfunctional family relationships, magnificent character development, positively bizarre dialogue and a labyrinthine plot combine to make this a post-modern Dickensian thriller that Charles himself would read with relish!<br /><br />THE SHADOW OF THE WIND is a magnificent travelogue of what is arguably one of the most beautiful exciting cities in the world - the breathtaking views from the heights of Montjuic; the outlandish but breathtaking, avant garde architecture of Anton Gaud&iacute;; the kitchy, gaudy tourist filled Ramblas avenue leading north from a bustling port and the Traflgar like monument to Christopher Columbus; the churches, the crumbling palaces and secluded courtyards; the 100 year old blue tram that rumbles up Avenida del Tibidabo to a spectacular view south of the entire city and the majesty of the Mediterranean.<br /><br />THE SHADOW OF THE WIND, more than merely sights, sounds and smells is also a story of the cultural and social milieu of a vibrant city<br /><br />THE SHADOW OF THE WIND is a political commentary offering a chilling portrayal of the paranoia that can overtake a frightened population in the wake of a blood-soaked revolution such as Generalissimo Franco completed after WW II.<br /><br />\\"Nineteen forty-five, a year of ashes.

B002IKLZZY|5.0|This movie is a classic!  A period piece that is most enjoyable.  Hitchcock at his best.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This is an amazing documentary.  I have recommended to all of my friends and family.  It provides some really important information that we need to know about food practices.  Regardless as to how you feel about eating meat, not eating meat, etc., this documentary will help you to make informed decisions about what you feed yourself and your family.  This video has positively impacted my family.  My 9 year old now views food in a different way and has decided to stay clear of beef and pork, and to eat only free-range or hormone free chicken.  I can't say enough positive things about this documentary!  A must see!

B001OQCV6K|5.0|Place your logical brain on pause and just enjoy the action and witty dialog between the two leads. Rachel McAdams is a most pleasant surprise as Holmes's love interest and foil. Short and simple.
0439023513|4.0|To those people who have slammed the book, you need to get over yourselves. This is a great coming of age book/series with a love story and a war set as a backdrop. Just about every emotion or struggle of Katniss' has been experienced by every girl in some way. Maybe it's not hunger for food but growing up hungry for something - hunger for a parent who's unreachable, hungry for attention, acceptance, independence and freedom.    What this series/book does well is touch on each of those. Don't hunger for something the book is not.
B00008OWZC|5.0|All the other reviewers giving this a five star are dead on. This is a whole new level of Zeppelin listening experience that will blow you away. I'd rank this up there with The Allman Brothers Band at Fillmore East as the top classic live rock album of all time. It reveals nuances to the live performance that really shows the legend that was Zeppelin among the people that saw them live (as opposed to the Song Remains the Same, which I hate). Even if you only have a couple of Zeppelin albums, this one should be next in your collection.
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|How can anyone not like a John Wayne movie.  This is just great, it is in wide screen and that is how it needs to be viewed.  This movie is meant to be seen in widescreen and you will miss alot if you don't view it this way.  it just seems that the Duke and Maureeen Ohara are made to be an on screen couple.  They are great.  Its hard to believe that the moview is almost 60 years old and it is still totally intertaining.  I would recommend this moview to anyone, it is just the best.
1439181780|1.0|I am only on the 2nd Chapter and this is SO painful to read. The Secret was such a wonderful well written book, and had a very positive experience reading it. However, I'm now realizing The Secret was a great book due to the many wonderful resources who contributed to it and helped Rhonda Byrne write it.<br />The Power, completely written by Rhonda Byrne, contains the worst written skills. As an author, she should be embarrassed. Very disappointed so far....maybe the remaining chapters will improve, but sad to say my first impressions are not good ones.
B002O3Z50G|5.0|I love this film & it never ceases to amaze me. It is non-stop action & plenty of SUPER-AMAZING \\"footage\\" or rather scenes.<br /><br />This fast-paced story takes you along as witness to a bunch of storm chasers as they try to get internal data from tornados with an invention called \\"Dorothy.\\" A subplot of husband & wife in the midst of a divorce does not weigh you down. It is gently woven into the film in such a way that it enlivens the main plot rather than having the opposite effect of boring you to death.<br /><br />There is plenty of more-than-amazing & impressive tornado scenes & you have to give credit to the film director & computer geniuses who made this happen. There is a documentary & I suggest watching it because it explains how really difficult all this was to create. A tribute to these people is necessary.<br /><br />This film is captivating, it is a thrill ride. It keeps you fascinated, amazed, scared, laughing & crying & on the edge of your seat. Helen Hunt's intensity is infectious. You can't help to be a part of the unbelievable enthusiasm & fun-loving eagerness of those testosterone & adrenaline junkie American guys who can't wait to go into the path of deadly danger (the tornado) & call it \\"FUN!\\" There is profound tragedy, there is fun, there is danger, there is exhilaration & triumph--all this to be found in this movie.<br /><br />I think every European should watch this movie to truly understand what America suffers during & after a tornado--animals & people suffer & are killed, ancient trees are shredded & homes are turned into pulp & rubble.<br /><br />I got this out of a Walmart bin, but you can't beat this price!<br /><br />Oh, I forgot to mention--a Happy Ending.<br /><br />One last GREAT POINT! No animal abuse in this movie whatsoever. Oh How Great It Is! Thank You!

0316098337|5.0|The word \\"Room,\\" the title of this novel, is hard to pronounce without hearing the word \\"Womb.\\" Only the tiniest of phonemes separates the two, as this book implicitly reveals. The novel's narrator, five-year-old Jack, is tormented by being forced to survive with his 26-year-old mother, in a small shed at the back of her kidnapper's yard, with so little food the two must count out each individual piece of cereal each morning as he continues breastfeeding (\\"having some\\" as he puts it quaintly) at least partly to assure his nutrition. After a particularly brutal period of deprivation, when the kidnapper (\\"Old Nick\\") cuts off the heat and brings them no food for several days, Jack's mother (\\"Ma\\") comes up with the desperate plan that finally wins them their freedom.    In a sense, then, Jack has been permitted what is a kind of wish-fulfillment: to remain in the womb, to have complete access to mother, to forestall that inevitable physical separation. So even as we are joyful and relieved at their liberation, we also become increasingly aware that each of them has lost something with their emergence into the larger, confusing world, a world that immediately has designs on them.     The decision to tell the entire story from Jack's point of view enables author Emma Donoghue to explore the sense of loss that this final birth or emergence engenders. She manages his narrative voice sweetly and with gentle humor, as Jack learns to sleep alone, is weaned, develops beginning relationships with his own and the larger human family, samples new foods, and starts to see himself as others see him. Still, at times, his sense of loss is painful; especially when he is separated from his mother, a separation the book feels intensely, each exciting new experience is also a punishment. Jack is full of observations and questions that are often very revealing. \\"I bang my head on a faucet. 'Careful[,]' [says Grandma]. Why do persons only say that after the hurt?\\" This question could applyto the structure of the book, which hurls this mother/son couple into the world with such optimism, only to show how incremental and fumbling is the process of their reintegration. Perhaps this quotation, and others, may sound a little overly cunning, but Donoghue has a perfect ear for the voice of this precocious and vulnerable little boy.    Although an act of sexual violence provides the genesis of this plot and of the new life described within it -- and although there are some quite dark and troubling parts -- an aura of innocence suffuses this novel. Any parent will recognize it as the founding romance of mother and child, the first and most profound love, and yet so rare to hear it coming in a child's words and from his heart. A book to be grateful for.
B003NWS5AO|4.0|[...]    Band of Joy begins with \\"Angel Dance\\" - a strong opener with a great groove. Unfortunately the ringing sound (tambourine, I'm guessing) that pops up regularly every so often is very annoying to me - kind of like I suppose a dog whistle would be, if I were a dog... If I could only remove that, it would not just be a good track, but a great one.    \\"House of Cards\\" could be improved by making the production a little less muddy. I understand that it was a choice, but to me it just sounds like I'm listening to a static-y radio broadcast. Around 1:44 into the song, the static recedes for a bit for the \\"and the birds are wheelin'...\\" section and it sounds fantastic. I love the \\"and cracked and it's shaking\\" line - it's delivered perfectly - but then the static aspect returns around 2:15. This song works better live from the recordings I've heard.    I enjoy \\"Central Two-O-Nine\\". It's a fun little foot-stomper that would fit in well with a latter-day Zep acoustic set that might also include \\"Poor Tom\\".    \\"Silver Rider\\" is a dystopian epic - almost up there with \\"Darkness Darkness\\" as an enduring favorite cover by Plant. I bought Low's The Great Destroyer a couple months ago to hear this track and \\"Monkey\\" in advance of Band of Joy's release. The original \\"Silver Rider\\" is a little too achingly restrained for my taste, but Plant's version lets loose just the right amount. A standout track. Buddy Miller plays excellent, haunting guitar, and Patty Griffin's vocal accompaniment might be better here than anything else she does on the album.    Byron House's bass on \\"You Can't Buy My Love\\" is satisfyingly dirty and makes the song work much better than it otherwise would. The vocals are fine - there's a trademark Robert moment around 1:50. Not a substantial song, but fun. It probably should not have followed \\"Silver Rider\\" on the album and might have been better off appearing later on this disc.    \\"Falling in Love Again\\" is a very nice vocal showcase for Plant at thispoint in his career - his voice sounds rich and smooth. The steel guitar around 1:50 is a little too country/twangy for my liking; a short, sharp electric guitar solo might have improved it, but that's just me.    Unfortunately, \\"The Only Sound that Matters\\" begins with more of that extra-twangy steel guitar. The vocals are pushed forward a bit more in this song and sometimes the articulation isn't where it should be - the words sound a little 'thick'. This gets better around 2:15, but then there's more of the twangy guitar.    \\"Monkey\\" is perfectly ominous. The rumbling bass and drums, the distorted guitar, the perfectly matched dual vocals... another Low cover, and another standout track. A very good original that is taken to a higher level by Robert and his band. The only thing that detracts is more of that high-pitched ringing that was heard in \\"Angel Dance\\". Thankfully there's not quite as much and it's not as noticeable.    \\"Cindy, I'll Marry You Someday\\" features some pleasant banjo picking. The vocals are understated, whispered until around 1:40 when they become more forceful. Not my favorite track, but it picks up nicely in the last minute or so.    Plant, Buddy Miller, and Marco Giovino team up to make \\"Harm's Swift Way\\" one of the better tracks on the album. There is a confidence and strength to this song that contrasts with the plaintive and vulnerable nature of Plant's singing elsewhere on the disc.    \\"Satan, Your Kingdom Must Come Down\\" could have been a Fate of Nations B-side with Rainer Ptacek like \\"Dark Moon\\". Spooky...    I've been struggling to figure out what past Plant album that \\"Even This Shall Pass Away\\" sounds like it belongs on, but it's somewhere between Shaken 'n Stirred and the previously unreleased 1987 Now and Zen-era track \\"Upside Down\\" that appeared on Sixty-Six To Timbuktu. Either way, it's kind of funky and a little odd, but it works as the final track of the CD, probably about as well as \\"Brother Ray\\" did on Mighty Rearranger.A pretty good album overall - I give it a 7 out of 10 and place it somewhere in the middle in terms of Robert's post-Zeppelin work, below Pictures at Eleven (which has grown on me and really benefited from the remastering job for Nine Lives), Fate of Nations, and Mighty Rearranger, which are all big favorites.    I hope that Robert gets inspired to do some more writing of his own for his next album. Mighty Rearranger was very strong lyrically and musically following Dreamland, which was almost entirely a covers album, so perhaps history will repeat itself and we'll get a strong new collection of Plant originals in a couple years.

B000002KFJ|5.0|This cd brought back excellent memories and I'm stoked that I can still buy music like this so easily!
032147404X|4.0|This is pretty good.  It is set up assuming you know very little about using your dSLR.  It is basic, but it isn't a bad thing.  As he states, he doesn't try and bog you down with all the \\"science\\" and technicalities of taking the shots, just give the basics and if you want to understand it deeper, you can get a book that goes deeper.  So, if you are a beginner, pick this up.  It will help you a lot.
0679746323|1.0|I am utterly disgusted and saddened after I read the first few chapters of this book. I am perhaps a few years younger than the author but I also grew up during the Cultural Revolution. Unlike the author who left China in the late 70's, I lived in China all the way through Tienanmen Square massacre (1989). So I am not here to endorse Mao or Maoism or Communism by any means. However, the author has committed the same exact mistake/crime that wrecked hovac into millions of families and lives in China during Mao's reign. The logic, arguments and the premises upon which she built this huge book of hatred are the same exact things that sent my father to hard labor camp because he painted a picture of some western scenary, and that denied my seat in the college because my great grandfater was not \\"poor enough\\". I can go on. Reading this book brought back so many of those painful memories. By condamning him for every little thing he did or did not do even as a mere child and a young man seeking a future, the author has done a terrible disservice to those who suffered in his ruling. I will continue to read. But I hope that the author could see what she has done in no way has promoted truth, independent thinking or humanity.

B002ZCY7PU|4.0|I got it at Best Buy for 38.99 and was no waiting. Third season is fantastic, though I could have done without \\"Special Guest Star\\" Brandon Routh. The one good thing from that was an off-handed comment about him being Superman. Otherwise, this season was its usual series of brilliance. I'm looking forward to season 4! Special features still lacking on these discs. No commentaries. Not much behind the scenes stuff. However, they do have some of the best gag reels I've seen. It's not all people screwing up their lines and laughing. The mockumentary about Jeffster is awesome.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|If you love Michael Hall, this third dvd of the series Dexter will not disappoint.
0307346617|5.0|I loved it.  It's more like a collection of compelling short stories all in the same timeline.  Well worth the read if you like zombies and science fiction.
1439181780|5.0|I think it was George Bernard Shaw who said \\"Common sense is the rarest of attributes.\\" This book is Applied Common Sense. Read, mark, learn and inwardly digest and then put it into practice. Common sense, well written, and enjoyable too! As with The Secret, you just may have to learn to read between the lines, but that's half the adventure!
B0002F6AH0|1.0|The story is blatantly biased in favor of the allies and their treacherous leaders who have butchered the European people on the altar of the New World order designed by roosevelt and his internationalist advisers keen to destroy what was left of the Christian culture in Europe. At least the film demonstrates, against the author's intentio, that Germany has been used as spacegoat for triggering a new conflict between the European nations which will kill for ever their national pride and install the new world order decided by the winners. The report of the conflict on the Russian front looks like propaganda pictures delivered by the stalinist information ministry praising the miraculous recovery of the Red Army when it was shooting ten of thousands of its own troops under the pretext of cowardice. Not a world about the Ukrainian and Baltic people revolt against the communist sect supported by Roosevelt and his financiers. This is laughable.
B0040ZPLBY|1.0|Lots of folks who like medieval things recommended this to me, but it seems to suffer from the same plague as the newest BBC Robin Hood: so many blatant anachronisms it is simply unwatchable. First off, trousers? What is the costume department's aversion to hose? And, of course, a mishmash of centuries in the general garb of everyone, like a re-enactors festival. All right, it is about the Arthur legends and where does that really put it in terms of costumes, but pick a century already. Signs on the walls for people to read as well as letters written. Dear, dear. I suppose I don't mind so much the language used, a little updated for contemporary audiences, but with everything else, it's just too much. Why does it have to be so dumbed down? I was only able to get through twenty minutes of it. That's twenty minutes I won't get back.
6305128952|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie!! It is one of those timeless, heartfelt, raw, passionate movies that you can watch again and again and never grow tired of. Scarlett Johansson is amazing in this, especially for being such a young actress.
0439023513|2.0|I have to admit I found the first two books in this series compelling, and yes, I did get the messages: war and torture are evil; how we ignore it, block it out, remain ignorant or just embrace it all with a flair of televised coverage - all are bad. So, okay. I get it. I get it. Did I mention I get it?     I was hoping book three would be a lot more sophisticated and was surprised at how disjointed the final phase is. The book rambles and trudges through a similar format as the first two, but follows a weak and tired formula of inserting shock, then romance, then tragedy to the point of ridiculousness. The result is vaguely drawn conclusions and a real lack of editing or rhythm. The end is cheap in my estimation, as the author seems to try and save the vague rambles of the majority of the novel by making the end as gory and sensationalist as possible - all in the name of educating us?  Just because you paint a grand finale of children being shot, tortured, dismembered and set on fire through repeated bombings, doesn't make the tale enriching or educational. Yes, I know the scenes described echo those that have occurred in real life, and in real wars, but this doesn't make up for the fact that the author is still making a bit of brass off of this series and its movie deal(s).    So, if it isn't clear to the audience already, book three asserts that, shocker of shockers, war is bad. But, similar to the war profiteers described in the book, Collins isn't exactly losing a lot of money on this beleaguered set of life lessons.     The final book, Mockingjay, is poorly drawn and the series is cheaply ended.
B003K025V4|1.0|The new Miley Cyrus song\\"Cant be Tamed\\" is absolutely repulsive. The lyrics make Miley seem she believes she's the hottest person on the face on this earth. She is not and she is far from it. The lyrics \\"I go through guys like money flyin' out their hands\\" is not appropriate for the age of the majority of her fans. It also makes her seem like a trashy slut. The song shows that miley is a stuck up, spoiled, and immature girl. This is shown in the lyrics \\"Have to get my way, 24 hours a day 'Cause I'm hot like that\\". What she really needs to do is let all of the air out of her giant head and come back down to reality. The whole song is a cliche about how not one single guy can change her. Yeah, yeah, we get it. You're a crazy brat that \\"can't be tamed\\". This just makes you seem like an animal because humans shouldn't have to be tamed. This girl needs to go get talent, learn to sing, and write decent lyrics that don't make my ears bleed.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|This books never fails to make me cry. It's one of my favorites, and so touching.
B000LXH0AE|2.0|I thought the concept of the plot was original and something refreshing but the movie itself was a drag. Something about Will Ferrell just irks me the wrong way. I don't think he's a good actor at all and I don't find his humor amusing. Also I don't believe this film was meant to be a comedy because it wasn't funny at all. Which is fine, it works more as a dramatic piece but the execution of it all was just all too dull for me.
B003405MF6|1.0|Wow. Elevator muzak, performed by Jeff Beck!  Let's just write this one off and put it out of our minds.  And can someone please tell me the appeal of Joss Stone??
B00328G4XY|5.0|I can't even recall the number of copies of this album that I have worn out.  If you've never heard Electric Ladyland - don't wait act now.  I've read a few skeptics that have debated whether the 2010 releases have been remastered.  They have been.  If you do a direct comparison you'll find that the 1997 remasters focus on the punch of the midrange and drove the highs and lows beyond the limits of most standard equipment clipping the sound.  These new remasters are a little quieter but allow for the full dynamic range that this album offers.  The bass tones resonate and have a stronger presence than other CD versions.  The top range is crisp without being too bright and the mid range has force without overwhelming.  This is as close as a digital copy has come to my '68 vinyl version.  Is it remastered, yes.  For the average listener, the difference is subtle and may not be seeking out, but for the dedicated - this is some hot stuff.  Enjoy!
B003HARV98|5.0|I'm not a big fan of pop music, but this is VERY impressive for a first album!  Imagine, a young woman who can really sing and knows how to write a song with a hook (13 songs, to be exact !).  Buy this one.
0143038583|4.0|It took me a while to get into this book, but once I did I was hooked.  For the most part, the author remains completely objective, and by the end I began to think quite a bit about what I was eating, and how I ate -- which I imagine was the whole point.  Very good.

6305842418|5.0|This is one of the best WB Collector's box edition made.  Every piece in this collector's edition makes you feel like you own a piece of the movie.  For example, the limited edition senitype with 35 mm film frame and the lobby cards give any collector's a sense that they own a part of history.  One of my best sets yet!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Well I was extremely eager to read this book. I had been anticipating it for the last six months, however I was slightly disappointed in this book because it almost seemed like an entirely new series. The main thing tha i want to get across is that the thingthat i was most dissapointed with was the ending.  i am dissapointed because it was terrible way to end such a great serries. the ending to this book was made for an ending to a book with 1 more book left in the series.
0312600844|5.0|I heard some time ago that Frenzen was going to release a new book, so I've been eagerly awaiting this book for quite some time. Let me tell you, it did not disappoint.<br /><br />I think books that speak about our current state of society in a realistic way are always interesting, unfortunately it's a hard task to do it well. Franzen is one of the few who can. I don't want to give away plot details, but the character development, the way the story develops and grows on itself, and an incredible ending kept me deeply involved the entire time I was reading it.<br /><br />As the other reviewer mentioned, the ending certainly is emotional, but very, very well done. I really did wish there was more (even though it was a decently long book.)<br /><br />Good call by Oprah, as usual.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00006I53S|5.0|Have had this lens for a couple of years now and have used it in several countries traveling. It is an excellent overall lens. Usually carry my 70-300mm lens with me as well when traveling but 95% of the time use this one alone. It provides excellent quality photographs with either my XTI or XSI and has not failed me.  Reasonable weight, provides excellent clarity. Highly recommend it for an over-all lens to use as your primary lens.
0061854549|5.0|I love this book! In it Dan Ariely describes how he and his collaborators use the scientific method to judge the veracity of human being's most sacred self-deceptions. Are we honest? Are we free thinking individuals who optimize our own utility/happiness without consideration of psycho-social baggage? Would we consider sex with animals if sufficiently aroused? These guys call themselves experimental economists, (as I recall), but the range of their research extends far, far beyond what many of us would consider the (mostly) dreary purview of the professional economist. And the fun which Ariely and colleagues have in their work comes through in his writing.    This book is a great read. And the mileage I've gotten by my retelling of some of the experiments it describes, at dinner and cocktail parties, makes it a bargain at twice the price!
B000K4X2UQ|4.0|Whitesnake ended their first incarnation with a double live album towards the tail end of 1980. `Live in the Heart of the City' is rock solid representations of the band's oeuvre to date as most if not all of their best songs are featured. When the record was released state side, only the 1980 show was featured and two songs were shorn off. This current import reissue features both Hammersmith Odeon performances from 1978 and 1980. There are a couple of repeats but I for one don't mind two of \\"Come On\\" as the song is one of my favorite Coverdale tunes ever and is a thrilling opener to either set.  Not a flawless live LP because some tedium does appear in rather unexpected places; for example though I love \\"Ain't No Love\\" there doesn't need to be two of those and \\"Lovehunter\\" is just stretched to excruciating length due to an awful slide solo from Mickey Moody (though I love the studio version). Meandering would be the word to describe it an though I generally like his playing on all of the Whitesnake records he was a part of I really don't care for his slide guitar solo (ain't no Joe Perry!).  Another flaw is \\"Mistreated\\" which is a Blackmore showcase, not one for mere mortals (yes I know David wrote the lyrics but give me Dio any day!). That being said the first three tracks are fantastic and \\"Ready n' Willing\\", \\"Trouble\\" and \\"Might Just Take Your Life\\" are a holy trifecta of blues rock genius. I really wish David had followed his blues muse more than his hair metal one towards the end of the decade but the man wanted to score in the  US and though I will always prefer this version of Whitesnake, that's not what sold the hotcakes from 1987-1990. Love Coverdale (saw him in 2009) though he totally disregards anything from pre-1984 on stage...too bad so sad...
B003JJA59K|3.0|The acting in this film is quite excellent, however the story makes \\"On the Beach\\" look cheerful.  This is the most bleak and depressing thing I ever saw in 60 years of film watching.  The really bad part is that it is eminently believable.  Kudos to Mortensen and the whiny kid.
B002C6LR7K|5.0|This album is magical and one that stays in rotation in my CD player and Mp3 player constantly.  I've listened to it many, many times.  I've followed his career since seeing him with Chick/Origin at the Blue Note in the mid 90's and have all of his other albums but this recording is special.  The resonance of his voice and bass playing are truly spectacular.  There is real depth and nuance to each composition yet at times like in Alon Basela real excitement and jubilation leaving you in a frenzy making you listen to the CD again and again.  The band is top notch.  More importantly than the individual performance of the musicians, it's evident that there is a connection between all of the performers.  This is a real band as opposed to supporting players vamping and soloing.  These are beautiful compositions played with real care and expression.  I've read other reviews panning it as not jazz enough.  That may be a partially correct statement compared to his other CD's but this CD goes beyond Jazz and reaches into the heart of a real musician whose artistry has broken down the pigeon holes of modern categorization of jazz.  He's branched out to include his personal Israeli/middle eastern traditions which includes his jazz experience and painted a new audio picturescape.  I believe he's managed to carve out his own personal sound which encompasses all he has experienced and blended them into a truly beautiful album.  You can hear the sophistication and resonance.  You don't need to understand Hebrew nor Spanish to enjoy the brilliance of the melodies.  The album is pure emotion.  There is glee, tragedy, exuberance and sadness in these compositions which reaches deep within you on many levels.  A personal favorite is Alfonsina Y el Mar.  This tune is upright bass and Voice only which work in perfect harmony as it describes this tragic poetic song.  Also, if you are a bass player, this is a must purchase CD.  Get it.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|I purchased this CD based on one song I heard on the radio. I'm really happy to hear that all the songs measured up! \\"Bleezers Ice Cream Store\\" is really fun, and there's a song where she sings about being a giant who used to eat little boys, but since she's older and wiser now, she dines mostly on eels. It's a hoot!
B0010DGYJW|5.0|Look!!  I'm a judas priest fan at heart but I felt compelled to write this to let others know how very impressed i am w/ this record!!  When I was a teen, I liked WASP ok but never a big fan; until now!!  The Crimson Idol is THE BEST ALBUM I ever heard, period!!And that includes over Screaming for Vengeance!(hurts to say that, though!)  Can't get enough of it!! The lyrics are very personal, you can tell, to Blackie and because of this, there is INCREDIBLE feeling in his vocals on each track, almost haunting. The drums and guitar are awesome and it just overall, kicks incredible ass!!  Get it, you won't be disappointed!!!
B003K1EYM6|5.0|This is a fabulous addition to the IPad.  I used it on my recent trip to SE Asia, where we visited zoo's and jungles. I used 2 GB memory cards and so did others in my group and we uploaded our pictures each day or so directly into the IPad. It uploaded in a very short time. Then we had our own show each evening of everything we had done. We also uploaded video from the memory cards and it worked just perfectly. Don't go on a trip without this!
B0026NWBY2|4.0|This collection, as beautiful as it is, falls short in 2 areas.  First is the sound, and I am surprised because I thought Giles Martin (George Martin's son) did a masterful job on the Love project...but he did have the multitracks to work with on that material.  Here, working only with the stereo master tapes, the sound is not as detailed as I hoped it would be.  In fact, I believe the cuts from ATMP sound better on the 2000 remaster.  Not much to quibble with over what was selected, but a George Harrison collection without Beware of Darkness?  Ridiculous!  A 2 CD set is what was called for.    As far as the packaging, it's as beautiful and tasteful as one could ask for.
0786956291|4.0|Everything old is new again.  Sort of.<br /><br />Here's the new 'Red Box' D&D Starter!  Overall I like it; the DM book looks very good.  The player book is half as long, and I wish it had a bit more crunch.  A few more pages could have made it possible to roll up a new character without going through the OMGoblin! solo game every time.  Ah, well.  I'm sure they want us all to run out and buy Heroes of the Fallen Arches.  It worked on me!  What can I say?<br /><br />The box itself is deeper than those you might remember from years gone by.  Lots of room for your new handbooks!<br /><br />The power cards are a nice idea but problematic in use.  You get one copy of the 'elven accuracy' card, for example, so if you have two people playing elves you're a bit out of luck.  Personally, I plan to put all the power cards for an individual character in plastic CCG binder page.  Photocopy that and - hey, presto - you have a personalized character power page.  It's like, well, magic!  But do be careful when you separate the cards.  Hasbro-Of-The-Coast saved a bit of cash when they bought this card stock.<br /><br />The tokens, now that's a different story!  Thick, sturdy cardboard printed in full color.  Very nicely done!  One look at these and [[ASIN:0786956313 Monster Vault: An Essential Dungeons & Dragons Kit (4th Edition D&D)]] just landed on my Christmas list.  One odd thing is that they show different critters on both sides of the same token.  That could be fun, though.  That giant rat you were fighting?  It just morphed into a drake!
B003TEO3EI|5.0|The new offering of songs from Blind Guardian are poised to become Classics. The sound production is stellar. The song arrangements are composed with many layers of sound and instruments including medieval, which we expect from Blind Guardian, and interestingly impressive symphonic touches that do not dominate or undermine the Metal that is so very well delivered here. Some bands who use symphonies along with metal tend to overdue it. Blind Guardian prove to be masters of the genre without ever sounding lame, the metal is never compromised throughout this offering. Speaking of Metal, The Metal on this disc, hacks, slices, bludgeons and tramples the listener under the cloven hooves of the War Beast that is Blind Guardian and what all of their fans expect from this well weathered long enduring band.    Along with the Metal are two acoustic songs that are every bit welcome as the metal. It is what every true Blind Guardian fan expects from them, and why not? Blind Guardian excel in the acoustic genre, and in my opinion can make a fine and prosperous living on that alone if they choose.    Hansi's Voice is in top form here. He is delivering some of his best vocal performances on this disc. Stellar vocalizings abound from this amazing Metal Vocalist. There is not one single bad song on this disc. The guitars are fierce like severing, chopping axes that are mercilessly in your face, and the thunder of the bass and drums are perfectly mixed. Superior sound mixing and engineering. This could easily win for best Metal album of the year, it is that good.     It is truly a Blind Guardian Classic already. It is a keeper. I applaud you Blind Guardian, you have delivered well this time. Excellent work.
B00015BIOQ|5.0|I first heard of this artist and CD at a speaker demo at a trade show. Liked the song I heard and wanted to hear more. This CD is beautifully recorded and if you like \\"Americana\\" music, is a must have! The whole CD from start to finish worth the listen. If your even remotely hesitant... Don't be... BUY IT! Well worth it!

B001VEHZZ2|4.0|Using an unusual narrative format--the narrator talking to a stranger at a cafe--the book builds suspense while illuminating the big gap in perception between a highly educated Middle Eastern immigrant and the Americans he encounters.   Eight people in my book club thought it valuable, and enjoyable to read.
B0030I5S8I|5.0|Craig Ferguson's book, \\"American on Purpose\\", is an honest telling of a life begun in the hard and fast lane.  It is straight forward and gritty, but that only endears him to us even more.  A brave man to let us look into his deepest and darkest corners.  A quick but insightful read.[[ASIN:B0030I5S8I by Craig Ferguson American on Purpose, The Improbable Adventures of an Unlikely Patriot First Edition / First Printing edition]]
B0032KNA4I|3.0|The service from the provider was excellent!  My mistake was marking the wrong box - I don't have Blue Ray.  So, I can't actually comment on the product itself as I had to return it and they did not have a regular version available.  I would order from them again, however.
0062020889|4.0|You can't tell the players without a scorecard and here's the scorecard.  Ken Follett once again weaves and a amazingly complex story that is simple at heart.  There are many sides to war and here we see a ton of them.  Double cross on top of double cross as characters and motives keep popping up.  It was a little slow going at first but then it really got moving.  I enjoyed the many points of view and the research involved in this project.  A really solid spy novel!

B003V5PPZG|1.0|After the tragedy that was Minutes to Midnight, Linkin Park continues their downward spiral with A Thousand Suns. Another album that sounds nothing like their first and second albums. I do admit, I gave it a full listen, but I couldn't find a single song on the album that I cared for. That, and the fact that now, in order to sell albums, they freely use the f-bomb in the album. It seems more like a cash-grab than anything. It's like hey, we were relevant once! Buy this! If this the way they want to continue making albums, count me out as a fan.
B0035V35P8|4.0|Good action movie in the realm of fantasy action adventure. Story is far fetched but it's a movie. I wasn't really expecting anything realistic in terms of the martial arts. Update to the older ninja movies such as [[ASIN:B000092Q4V Revenge of the Ninja]] with modern movie making techniques. Movie meets the goal of entertaining the audience it's aimed at.
B003OFVIXG|5.0|Wow. I was attrach by her voice once i heard.  Highly   recommend!
0374158460|2.0|I'm amazed at most of these reviews. I hadn't read \\"Corrections,\\" but when almost every critic declares \\"Freedom\\" a literary masterpiece, I had to at least pick it up.  After 250 pages, I put it down for good.     Instead of loving these characters, as Amazon.com's official review promised I would, I found them to be terminally tedious. The focus of part of the book on physical masturbation is just a metaphor for the mental and emotional processes of the characters.      The cardboard cutouts could have labels instead of names: The Unfulfilled Housewife, The Dull But Well-Intentioned Husband, The Irresistible Other, The Rebellious Son, the Weird Girlfriend, The Sexy Adoring Assistant, etc., etc.  There's an occasional insight, but not enough to justify spending a big chunk of your life plodding through 576 pages.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|It's been just about 15 years since I bought a new album that blew me away.  It's been more than a decade since I bought an album, and stopped listening to all other music just so I could listen to it over an over.  It's been a long time since I've enjoyed the lyrics of songs so much that I've had to google them so I could read them all at once.  Mumford & Sons album, Sigh No More, changes all of that.    Before today, I'd never heard of them.  I'm so glad that all changed.  Thanks to a the Current, a public radio station dedicated to playing modern rock in Minneapolis, and the wonders of my iPhone app Shazam, I'm now the proud owner of their music.  What pleasure. Enjoy.
B001IFZL50|5.0|After being deployed and watching this series, it just underscores the reality.  It was truly an accurate portrayal of Iraq and the conflicts, along with mistakes by American Forces.  Nothing is ever perfect during war.  I found the 10 digit grids accurate and what was interesting was the cities they entered.  All of which I have encountered near Al Kut.    The only problem I have had is that my Blu-ray discs are jumping scenes and I have tried three other players and it happens to every one of them.  I am going to try and see if I can get an exchange and try a new series after writing Amazon.    Otherwise, the movie series is excellent.  I am not a Marine, I am Army - but they did a great job and we are all on the same team. Hooah!
B003UYUQZW|3.0|Prince of Persia (POP) as a game was/is great fun. Having played the very first version (yeah, I am over 40) on an IBM 8088 with an orange on black screen and then having played the Sands of Time on PS2 I can say I really like the premise. But good games do not necssarily good movies make. And POP is no exception. (Still it is much better than many other such attempts)  It is -as expected- a \\"no brains necessary - just use your eyes please\\" type movie. And I have no objection to such movies. I actually love them. Not all films need to work on the grey matter. We need movies to flush out the days's stress as well. We do need soap bubbles.  My problem is that this is a really big soap bubble. Even as a pure action flick, it failed to raise any interest in me. Everything and everyone is flat. Even the grand action scenes (the siege for example) feel so rushed that excitement wanes before it can take hold of you. Gemma Arterton is nice to look at but wooden - and there is no chemistry between her and the prince. Jake Gyllenhaal is probably nice eye candy for the ladies but it is Mr. Kingsley who delivers as a good (albeit very classical) villain.  Action scenes are wll planned and Jake Gyllenhaal's hopping from wall to wall does connect you to the game. But I really must say that as a purely fantasy piece, there is a lack of \\"fantastic\\" in this movie. I really can not say I liked it. Resident Evil with all of its flaws continues to be my favorite game-to-movie adaptation.
B0036TGSR6|5.0|Whatever on thinks about Roman Polanski the man certainly knows how to make compelling films. Since \\"Knife in the Water\\" (in 1962) he has been giving viewers psychological horror films that remain among the best of all time. In \\"The Ghost Writer,\\" Polanski shifts his aim at a more subtle horror -- the criminal activities of world leaders that hide behind their so-called patriotism. There are a lot of allusions in this film, some obvious (to Tony Blair, ex-Prime Minister of Great Britain) and some ironic (Adam Lang, the ex-PM, is sequestered in a hideaway that suggest Polanski's own recent incarceration in his Swiss Chalet while under house arrest in Switzerland). The thrust of the story is a memoir Lang is writing. The first ghostwriter he employs dies under mysterious circumstances (Suicide? Murder?) and another, unnamed writer (wonderfully played by Ewan McGregor) is employed to touch up the script. Soon accusations surface regarding Lang's involvement with the CIA. The \\"Ghost\\" is now under fire to complete the heavy-handed ms. sooner than expected to capitalize on the recent events. The manuscript becomes the focal point of the film. The Ghost's room is ransacked. Lang's subordinates are not quite what they seem (even his wife falls under suspicion), and there are telling clues in the ms. and research of the former ghost that suggest Lang is guilty of the crimes he so vehemently denies. Without revealing much more of the plot, the film follows the Ghost on his mission to find the truth. But the truth has a cost, and what is the truth anyway? Polanski seems to be asking these questions of himself in addition to the actions of the leaders who spin the truth for their own expediency. Pierce Brosnan must be acknowledged as a fine choice for Lang. His performance is one of his best. Olivia Williams, Tom Wilkinson and 95-year old Eli Wallach, who is a treasure to behold, deliver other delicious acting turns. There are holes in the script (let the viewer find them) andsome stilted performances (Kim Cattrall and Timothy Hutton don't seem to fit), but Polanski weaves his spider's web of deceit and betrayal like few directors can or could. This is an exercise in style and paranoia, and a pointed examination of the people who shape political events.
0743246616|5.0|Fell in love with the bakery in NYC and was happily told they had a book available. Book is wonderful high quality. Beautiful pictures, easy to follow directions, and the recipe's I've tried so far taste just like the stuff you buy at their bakery.  Best vanilla cake and frosting ever!

0140157352|5.0|I recently finished reading the book `Getting to Yes' by Roger Fisher and William Ury. The book expanded on the concepts I was taught in the eCornell Project Leadership Certificate Conflict Resolution class.<br /><br />I learned how to separate the people from the problem, focus on interests instead of positions, invent options for mutual gain and insist on using objective criteria to arrive at a fair agreement. Additionally, the book focused on techniques for responding to attacks by using \\"negotiation jujitsu\\" instead of responding in kind.<br /><br />I got a lot of value out of this book because it provided me with a method to rely upon when I am nervous or scared before and during a negotiation.<br /><br />My biggest Eureka! moment in the eCornell class was realizing that by concentrating on interests instead of positions, I could free both sides of the table to craft an agreement that would satisfy both sides without necessarily needing concessions by either side.<br /><br />I liked learning about \\"negotiation jujitsu\\" techniques when I read the book, because I feel frustrated and nervous when negotiations turn into personal attacks. Learning a method for handling personal attacks will help me be a more effective negotiator in the future.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for potential students and alumni of the eCornell Project Leadership Certificate classes.
B003O7I6L6|4.0|The film is a cult classic and the sound quality is the major improvement on Blu-ray as compared with earlier versions.     You simply don't find pacing in an action film as good as this dystopic film and it is truly one of Carpenter's best, really capturing the political pessimism of the eighties.    Unfortunately, there are no extras. I would have liked the inclusion of the commentary and the deleted train heist scene. I thought it was a great contrast to the darkness of the rest of the film. These can only be found on certian previous DVD (and VHS) editions.
0312600844|5.0|I purchased Freedom: A Novel the day it was released and meant to write a review. Just got an email from Amazon, announcing that Freedom is the newest Oprah pick, so decided to review it here.<br /><br />As a non-fiction author, I have always been awed at the ability of (good) fiction writers because they take characters and bring them to life! To do this successfully is a true gift--a gift that Jonathan Franzen possesses.<br /><br />There are few things more satisfying than a great novel...and a long great novel is even better! Jonathan Franzen managed to keep me riveted for almost 600 pages. You know the feeling...when you are reading a terrific book, all you want to do is read it!<br /><br />Now, Freedom is just the type of novel I love, as he depicts characters from a sociological point of view. While I also enjoy sociological books from a historical perspective (Sinclair Lewis, Steinbeck, Dostoevsky, etc) I also love a novel set in our current times.<br /><br />Without giving away the plot, suffice to say this novel deals with life in the 21st century and that Franzen does an excellent job of portraying both the minutia and the bigger picture.<br /><br />I found myself nodding throughout;as in, I get this. But I also laughed...and, warning--do not read ending in public if you don't like crying in front of people! Ultimately, this book will have you reflect on your own life and the choices you ultimately make.<br /><br />Highly recommend.<br /><br />Non-fiction author, reader, reviewer
B002JVWR9U|5.0|Wow so I cannot remember a show on the CW that I have enjoyed this much since Supernatural. Vampire Diaries is simply amazing and like I said its a million times better than Twilight. And im not trying to bash Twilight at all, im a fan of the books and I watch the movies cause they're a guilty pleasure. But VD blows them BOTH out of the water! Ive never read the VD books so I cannot say how well the show compares to them but I don't care, this show is simply fantastic. Its everything Twilight wishes it could be. And my favorite part about it is its actually not afraid to be a little mature and grown up. Your not going to get any frickin \\"Glittery\\" vampires in this show. And yes while Damon and Stephan are both completely dreamy and gorgeous they can be dangerous and violent if need be. They're not the wimpy type of vampires that are so sadly being so popular at the moment. What also made me very pleasantly happy is that even though this was only the first season of the show it was so well developed and entertaining! The writers and directors and producers really are very talented and know how to out together an awesome show from the very beginning. Every actor in this show is amazing as well. They are all very strong and there's no one that brings the show down, I didn't like Caroline at first but she's definitely growing on me. My favorite character has to be Bonny, Elena's friend who discovers she has special powers. I absolutely love her character and everything she goes through. Also this show has some SERIOUS eye candy!!! Stephan and Damon are Blazing Hot and Tyler is very cute as well. CW does a very good job at getting some good hunks to be on their shows lol. They girls are also very sexy as well so straight guys have something to like about it too haha. So if you even remotely like vampire stories or are a Twilight fan you HAVE to watch this show, its simply Amazing! Everything about it is spot on perfect. You will not be disappointed with this show I can guarantee it! Also the second has obviously started and its already 10x better than the first season so you have even more to look forward to after watching the first!!!!
B001CO9KKY|5.0|Believe it or not some folks still think everything, every movie, was filmed perfectly and without covering up filming snafus.  This is a very good transfer and It so overwhelmingly beats the DVD and original movie quality that you can see the varying colors of her iris during the fly catcher scene. It was crystal clear to the grain of the film during that shot and many others. As a matter of &#34;been there and saw it with my own eyes&#34; kind of fact, they did a fantastic job on the entire Blu-ray. Ya it was a marginally impressive movie for most movie goers but the dedicated watchers like myself will appreciate the quality.<br />May your film experience be great. May your Expectations be reasonable, and may everything you touch turn to HI-DEF!<br /><br />Thanks.

B000YABIQ6|4.0|So been shopping around for a new series since The office has jumped the shark. this dude on facebook kept writing recaps the new season of Mad men on his updates. So I decided to check it out,start from the beginning.  It is a soap opera ,but a good one. Unlike a soap opera the writing is not empty and the characters are more than cardboard cutouts. Like Don who wants to love his wife and family, but doesn't know how, because he doesn't grasp what love truly is .   And roger the big mouth who is digging his own coffin and partying constantly because he has nothing else left. And betty an accomplished woman who resents being a housewife and makes everyone around her suffer for it.  You can see this desperation in everybodies eyes like they can't stand being stuck in these dumb molds society put them in one more minute.  I love looking at the clothes. The colors are so bright, they hit you in the face.Because I didn't live in this era and the few pictures I have of my grandparents and family during this time are in black and white. So you can't see the vibrant colors.Like what color ball gown so and so was wearing.  It really bothers me some of the things people say to each other.Even though I know people talk like this, then and now.   Like Roger telling a female friend who is his right arm that she is the finest piece of ass he's has ever had, or how one character tells peggy who is slightly chubby , and she should  enjoy the crude comments made by execs while they last, cuz she isn't much to look at.  The only quibble I have is the dvd doesn't come with many perks. Like their is no way you go back and look at scenes. And they don't tell you what the episodes are about.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I am working my way through this DVD - it is more challenging than I thought. It is definitely not for people just starting out exercising - you could injure yourself trying to keep up. Jillian is going to kill me with this DVD, but I keep putting it back in. Go easy on yourself the first time and see how your body responds the next day before you step it up. I didn't feel anything after my first workout, but the next day my quads, hamstrings, glutes, and arms were in serious lactic acid burn and I took three days to walk normally up and down stairs.
0440217563|4.0|You cannot help but enjoy the historical events and match them with the events taking place in the book.  The heronine is someone to relate to and the timetraveler aspect is one of intrege and almost believeable. 18th century with a twist.  Great read.
0307473473|5.0|Nice book! Other books in the trilogy are great as well. However, I only bought it because my the copies in my local libraries are always checked out (i.e. I doubt I will re-read this in the future).
B002JCSWV6|5.0|I highly recommend this movie for more sophisticated and insightful people, teenagers on up.  It is slow and possibly difficult for younger children (and those that need constant action to be entertained) to follow.  Don't think those people would understand the deeper meaning unless it was explained to them.  I absolutely LOVED this.  It could/should be an inspiring message to leaders everywhere.  This lesson, if learned,  would definitely help to heal mankind, on many levels and with all nations.  This was the perfect venue to show this lesson example.
B0036EH3X4|5.0|I don't know why, but I never had any interest in Lost when it originally aired. Then this past summer I picked up seasons 1-5 on Amazon for a great price. I was, like so many people, drawn into the show the likes of which I hadn't been since \\"MillenniuM\\" and \\"The Sopranos\\". Naturally, I had to complete my collection and purchase season 6. I am glad that I did. I am drawn to shows that have characters I actually care about---good or bad, it doesn't matter. I cared about almost every character in Lost. The writing for this series was brilliant, as was the acting. The cinematography was breathtaking, especially in HD. A side note, the video transfers to blu-ray are spectacular. There have been many television programs that haven't ended perfectly; interestingly the two shows that I mentioned earlier fit squarely into this category (maybe I am attracted to shows that can't tie up all loose ends;-), but that isn't why I watch television---to have all my questions answered. And even though I did scratch my head a bit at the finale, in retrospect, Lost gave me countless hours of enjoyment. Someday I'll watch it again. Don't watch a show for the final destination; watch it for the ride---and Lost was indeed a beautiful ride. Highly Recommended.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Let me just say that the picture amazon has is a bit misleading. It only comes with ONE fan, not two. The other must be bought separately.     Installation was very easy once I figured out what the poorly pictured instructions were trying to convey. Maybe I'm just dumb but I didn't realize that one of the brackets actually sits BEHIND the mobo, not on top of the CPU, but it's sort of hard to tell from the instructions. Anyways, my i5-760 idles at 20 degrees, haven't seen it break ~45 degrees yet. I've yet to overclock but I'm sure with this fan/heatsink I can overclock far without breaking a sweat.
1569242739|5.0|What a great cookbook, and the two women who wrote it are creative, brilliant and a little wacky all at the same time. The recipes are glorious and beautiful enough that I am baking cupcakes from this cookbook for my son's wedding.      The author's also have a vegan forum at [...].  Check it out... Lots of great ideas and links to other vegan websites, etc.      Just because you're vegan, you don't have to give up beautiful, great tasting cupcakes.
B000EOTAM6|3.0|I own this movie and love the story and concept. But not enough high-tech hardware to hold an action guy captive. Charize does the part very well and certainly can understand not wanting to dress her in the MTV outfit, although Charize was game to it. If any of you have played the Majesco game under the same title, you will see what weaponry and a very cool costume can really look like. Have you ever looked at a game's video intro and wonder WOW! now this would make a really cool movie...clueless as to why some producer can't see the potential or at the very least incorporate the weaponry and costumes to the movie. Guys LOVE COOL, action of course but this movie's target was definitely women. As I said though I do love the storyline and Charize's presence... naturally. Glad her voice was added to the Video game.
B00005NB38|5.0|I love this album. I thoroughly enjoy the early recordings of this band. They created their own remarkable versions of other artists songs of the 60's and we loved it then. I still love it now and had to get the CD, the ol' 8 track is wore out. Of course they had their original hit \\"HUSH\\" which is a classic great too. I highly recommend this album to anyone that wants to enjoy 60's music at its best.
044654759X|5.0|I couldn't put this one day.  I bought the book on Tuesday morning and was done by Wednesday afternoon, it was that good!  The story keeps your attention the whole way through with a perfect twist in the ending, that I never saw coming.  If you liked \\"The Gaurdian\\" you are sure to love this new one...it has a very suspenseful feel to it just like \\"The Gaurdian\\" had.  I highly recommend, it is in my top 3 for Nicholas Sparks books!

0385340990|3.0|\\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\" is a charming book in the line of \\"84 Charing Cross Road.\\" It's mostly historical romance, but also introduces many readers to the various privations and accommodations of those living on England's Channel Islands during World War II. It's an interesting topic, if only because the occupation of the England's Channel Islands (1940-1945) is hardly, if ever, mentioned in traditional history books. In fact, I suspect most people don't even know that the Channel Islands belong to England or that they were occupied by the Nazi's during World War II.<br /><br />According to Wikipedia, \\"The inhabited islands of the Channel Islands are Jersey, Guernsey, Alderney, Sark, Herm (the main islands); Jethou, Brecqhou (Brechou) and Lihou. All of these except Jersey are in the Bailiwick of Guernsey. In addition there are the following uninhabited islets: the Minquiers, &Eacute;cr&eacute;hous, Les Dirouilles and Les Pierres de Lecq (the Paternosters), are part of the Bailiwick of Jersey, and Burhou and the Casquets lie off Alderney..\\"<br /><br />Regarding the occupation by the Nazi's, Wikipedia tells us \\"The Occupation of the Channel Islands refers to the military occupation of the Channel Islands by Germany during World War II which lasted from 30 June 1940 until the Liberation on 9 May 1945.\\"<br /><br />Like \\"[[ASIN:0140143505 84, Charing Cross Road]],\\" \\"The GL&PPPS\\" (sorry, but the title is just too long to keep typing) is an epistolary novel, that is, consisting exclusively of letters sent from one character to another. In this case, the letters are mostly those of our heroine and her publisher, while she (our heroine) is visiting Guernsey looking into an idea for a novel. Epistolary novels enjoyed their greatest popularity during the 18th and early 19th centuries. Nevertheless, one will still pop up from time to time.<br /><br />The novel was moving along fairly nicely when I began to have an ominous feeling that our heroine was about to reproach herself as \\"a little fool\\" (a phrase indispensable in melodramas and romance fiction) for daring to think or hope that one of the island's few men (most had been conscripted for the war) was falling in love with her. From that point on, the book more or less sputters to an end worthy of a Harlequin Romance. Fortunately, up to that point \\"The GL&PPPS\\" is a very nice story set in an unusual place in a difficult time in history. The Nazi occupiers figure very little in the story, and the few that do tend to be fairly quiet members of the German Army of Occupation, and, except for food shortages, life seems to go on as it has for possibly several hundred years.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you like romances, particularly historical romances (in fact, my sister is writing one as we speak), you will enjoy \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society.\\" It has colorful characters on both sides of the Channel (which the French call la Manche, meaning \\"sleeve\\"), although the war appears only as a mild background perturbation, despite the fact that the story takes place during the brutal bombardment by Germany of British population centers, especially London. Had I written the novel, I would have focused a great deal more on the occupation, but the task of the critic is to criticize the book that was written, and not the one he or she might have written. So, as it stands, \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\" is a pleasant entertainment which all fans of Masterpiece Theater will undoubtedly enjoy.ool\\" (a phrase indispensable in melodramas and romance fiction) for daring to think or hope that one of the island's few men (most had been conscripted for the war) was falling in love with her.

014241543X|1.0|I read a lot, but don't review. However, I had to put my two cents in on this one. Teen sex and the F-bomb is used throughout. I finished it so I could feel good about reviewing the book, but this story was a real disappointment. I was happy to turn my YA's away from this one. Life is too short to spend on 'meh' books.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|One of my greatest pleasures has been introducing my young son to all of the geeky things that I love.  He's taken to them like bees take to flowers.  By far, his favorite geeky thing is DOCTOR WHO.  I was so thrilled to be able to order him his own Sonic Screwdriver and he was absolutely tickled when he received it.<br /><br />So, for a kid who loves WHO, the toy is great.  I only noticed one sound, not two, but it was authentic and not loud enough to be annoying to parents.  Also, mine didn't have the \\"Psychic Paper\\" pad for some reason.  Still, the UV ink nib worked well, which was a big plus to my son.  It seems sturdy enough, save for the pen tips, which I suspect won't stay on for long.  It isn't quite as detailed as I would have hoped, but, again, I'm an adult.  My son never noticed. When he picked it up, he became a Time Lord.  In the end, that's what's important.
0061353248|5.0|I recently took Social psychology as a course and a good amount of topics covered in this book are relevant to those covered in that class.  It's a much more inexpensive and effective way to learn about the intricacies of the social nature of us human beings.  Good insights and fun things to experiment with in your own life. An example is the tragedy of the commons, where it only takes one selfish b*stard to ruin everything for the group.  Good Read, nothing to complicated, if you want to hear some interesting topics about social psychology and economics, read this book.  His down to earth writing style makes his work understandable, unlike some books I have read in a similar nature which are esoterically written.
B000021Y77|5.0|You must see this film with a loud sound system.    Run Lola Run is high impact on every level.  The plot is easy enough:  Lola's motor scooter is stolen and as a result she is unable to pick up her boyfriend Manni for an important criminal gem/money exchange. Manni, forced to walk, and take the train, left the money on the train and a bum ran off with it.  Lola has 20 minutes to raise 100,000 DM and save her boyfriend Manni from being killed by a crime boss.     Three scenarios play out in the film.  Two end in disaster, one ends in triumph.  The music and thumping of the tech music soundtrack serves as the score, the beating of the main character's heart, and the tick-tock of a 20-minute window of time slipping away. The visuals are a marvel, making use of filmed scenes as well as scenes shot on video and later transfered to film for a muted look.  Every scene with Lola or Manni is film while any scene without them is shot on video.      Pay attention to where the color RED appears (phone, hair, ambulance, and even the color of the bedroom scenes that separate the three scenarios).  Try to see where the old blind lady (God)with black sunglasses appears in each scenario and what purpose she serves.  Note the occasions when glass breaks.  See how the fates of peripheral but essential characters in the film change from scenario to scenario in these sudden moments of flash frames.  Lola's father is a sinner, a bank executive who is cheating on his wife, Lola's mother, with a woman with fading reddish-brown hair.  Red, failure, mortality.  He denies Lola any help and reveals to her the affair without remorse.  My favorite use of visuals is comparing a round clock (a symbol for our mortality) with the round roulette wheel in a casino (God's clock...where miracles happen).  At one point Lola runs across a huge open courtyard with a fountain and it looks exactly like a roulette wheel and the betting grid.  Lola is killed in one scenario, watches Manni get killed in another, but succeeds in the third because she \\"surrenders\\" to the almighty while praying and running with her eyes closed through busy Berlin. Lola is \\"guided to a casino, hence the roulette wheel.  Of course, Lola's hair is red, but she does not bet on Red.  Red is blood, red is failure, red is our mortality.  When she gambles her only money she bets on the number 20 (minutes)and on the color BLACK, the color of the Nuns, the black sunglasses, and hence the intervention of God.  She wins on that number twice in a row, a miracle.  She walks away with over 100,000 dm.     Lola is put into service for the almighty when she gets into an ambulance (red ambulance) and holds hands with a heart-attack victim (a guard from her father's bank.) Her presence gives him the will to live and his heartbeat, a thumping music of a different sort, returns to normal.    Manni is also \\"saved\\" when the blind old lady with black sunglasses tells him to \\"wait\\" and sure enough Manni sees the person who stole the money from him.  While Manni is chasing the bum he causes an unintentional accident in the street that hurts (punishes) Lola's rotten father as well as killing the thief who stole her motor scooter at the beginning of the film.  God's wrath.  Manni \\"surrenders\\" as well, giving his gun to the bum in exchange for the money.    Manni, now gunless and useless as a criminal, gives the money to the crime boss, and meets Lola, who is waiting for him with a bag on money.  She now realizes that not only is Manni saved from the fate of the crime boss, but she and Manni can both start an honest life together and not resort to crime seeing as how she has over 100,000 dm in a bag that is all theirs.  The film ends with Lola smiling in joy as Manni simply asks:  \\"What's in the bag?\\"    THis is a masterpiece of fate, divine intervention, trying to take matters into our own hands, punishing the wicked and saving sinners.  Yes, this movie is heavy on spirit and don't believe anyone who says otherwise.The theme of all the elements being used to facilitate either a disaster or salvation is so comprehensive and well-executed that even the the most angry-at-God person or atheist will be knocked down by how good this film is.  Don't let foreign films scare you away.  This is even a good film for a youth group for teens at a church!  Yes it's in German and yes you will have to read subtitles.  FYI, this review I just wrote has about as many words as all of the dialogue of the film so there...you see?  You can do it.  Miracles happen even to the viewers of Run Lola Run!    JIM MACAYEAL
B002N5N5M0|4.0|I've been watching Dexter since it started and I really enjoy the series. Recent circumstances have led to me not being able to subscribe to Showtime so I've waited for the DVDs patiently and this fourth season disc was one of the best.The character comes back full circle to where He began.

B0021L8UPS|5.0|This has got to be one of the best horror/thriller movies I've seen this decade!     The story is about this family. The mom Kate and her husband john are experiencing a tough time in thier life because thier third child was born stillborn which is revealed at the beginning by a disturbing scene that will make any women shut her legs in pain. To cheer themselves up and fill the void they abdopt Esther whos a 9 year Russion a local orthanage. Thier youngest daughter Max shows sisterly love immediately, but the older and more suspicious Daniel is even less welcoming of Esther. It doesn't take long for s*** to go down. Not since Children of the Corn have I seen such a creepy \\"kids\\". Just like older killer kids movie, the siblings learn something ain't right before the adults. Some might find it cliche, but in this movie its done in a way that I never seen before. Esther holds a secret, an extremely dark secret that not even peaple who think they've seen this type of movie won't see coming. Its not just that shes an evil b**** either. I mean something noone will see thier first time watching. When I found out it was no questioning that this would be one of my top ten favorite movies this decade. I did have some problems though. These weren't necessarilly problems with the movie, but more of problems with the characters.    For one I thought the father was stupid. Seriously. He got what he deserved. I also found it a bit overboard how depressed the mother was. I never had kids so some might argue that I don't understand, but it still it seemed insane that she would become an alchoholic and thier marriage is nearly destroyed because she lossed her baby. She has 2 other kids shes neglecting because of it, plus she builds a shrine for the child! I do give her credit though, shes not as dumb as the father was. Other than that I really loved this movie. Its definately a must watch.

0385474547|4.0|* \\" Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart should be studied by everyone who works any place in the world in the 21st century. The novel should definitely be studied by every foreign agency of every established government. The reason why Things Fall Apart is so important today is that we are all competing and united like never before in this world. Almost all corners of the earth are known about and infiltrated. Achebe gives us a great novel that allows us to see the interaction of cultures. Things Fall Apart forces one to think about what should be adopted from another culture. Achebe warms that the all my culture - none of yours approach will destroy us all.\\" -

0984536159|5.0|We are living in a cycle of extremism. People have lost their faith in governments as well as institutions. This is nothing new. People have also lost their faith in any great intangible being(s). It is times like these that the masses turn to certain kinds of leaders. They embrace leaders who give them simple solutions to problems without explaining the details. These leaders never tell the truth when they list the facts of the cause for the despair of the masses. They divide the masses into a them and an us. After that these leaders turn the them against the us, the us against the them. Prosperity comes immediately. However, leaders like this always lose control and end up destroying the very people they swore to empower.<br />We would do well to read Mein Kampf because it was written by such a leader at the beginning of his march to ruler ship. The United States does not have to follow in Germany's footsteps. We can read Mein Kampf so that we will be able to recognize who not to follow. It took Germany fifty years to get over the damage left behind by Hitler. The U. S. is too fragile of an empire to withstand an Adolph Hitler at this point in time. - [...]
B0000024JA|5.0|Despite the fact that most newer music, and rap in general, has devolved recently into mind-numbing garbage, I decided to put in Method Man's breakout album, titled in reference to a slang term for a blunt mixed with sweetener - perhaps even referenced in Alexander Shulgin's seminal TiHKAL - for a repeat listen.  A very good idea.  What's interesting, however, is that the composition of the album follows the high and low patterns of a drug abuser, and the end result is similar to drug use:  the listener is hooked, despite the less than satisfying conclusion to the album.<br /><br />1) Tical - Kung Fu and drugs, it starts off crazy<br />2) Biscuits - Hypnotic and playful, this is the beginning of the drug binge.  This is the post-injection, initial high.<br />3) Bring the Pain - Full on tripping balls, seeing floating carrots and mystical double rainbows.  It's straight up Super Troopers: \\"I'm freakin' out, man!  Yes,  you are freaking out...man\\"<br />4) All I Need - As the title suggests, there is fulfillment in this grungy ode to women who are fond of rampant drug use (mentioned multiple times).  This is the final high after the first hit.<br />5) What the Blood Clot - With a hard piano line and abrasive shakes, one gets the feeling of a lottery ball being bounced and shoved around, careening off walls.  An overall good track, but nowhere near the previous.  The beginning of a nasty withdrawal.<br />6) Meth vs. Chef - An absolute trainwreck, MVC is just as bad as the second AVP (Aliens vs. Predators).  If this album is a series of drug experiments, this is a snort of cyanide laced with false bravado.<br />7) Sub Crazy - Meth gets back on track with this darkly charismatic, head-bobber.  There is an eerie, albeit slower, similarity to Biscuits.  The Meth vs. Chef single was enough to need a second hit of Tical.<br />8) Release Yo' Delf - Featuring a ridiculous chorus by Blue Raspberry and a sample from \\"I Will Survive\\" by Gloria Gaynor, the Release Yo' Delf single is, in my opinion, the most catchy of the entire album.  The feel is strong, powerful, triumphant, and the brass addition to the beat makes it almost regal.  Like many drugs, this second high is better than the first (i.e. All I Need) and actually causes the addiction, but it's the first one that is remembered.<br />9) P.L.O. Style - Once the pinnacle of euphoria takes place, the crashing and tweaking is faster than ever.  Nothing could be closer to the truth than P.L.O. Style, an affront to music that should be enough to press charges against contributors to this song.<br />10) I Get My Thang in Action - A little better than the previous atrocity, the high is expected now that you're hooked.  Therein lies the catch to drug addiction and this album.<br />11) Mr. Sandman - There is a definite nostalgic feel to Mr. Sandman because it sounds like a track from the 1993 breakthrough album Enter the Wu-Tang, but it lacks the luster of this album's overall effort.  As it was during that ensemble effort, Method Man stands out from the crowd, and this track is the third toke, something that dulls the edge but doesn't fulfill.<br />12) Stimulation - Effort is not lacking in the not-so-subtlely-named Stimulation, but satisfaction is.  The third high didn't last long enough to prevent another injection, and this track feels like an unsuccessful effort to pump up the album, to reproduce previous success.<br />13) Method Man - Self-titled and spelled out ad nauseum, this is bare bones effort lacking anything other than a few clever rhymes.  Nothing can satisfy me now that I'm hooked.<br />14) Bring the Pain (Remix) - Interesting because the listener has already tied off, but unlike the original song, this title is literal.<br />15) Release Yo' Delf (Remix) - Admittedly, this song has a VERY club-friendly beat, an infectious feel, and should have been a hit.  The fact that it was buried at the end of the album just makes it the poorly thought out decision of a drug addict.  Inertiafrom the original could have carried this song if it had replaced the wet dog smell left by P.L.O. Style.<br /><br />A great album overall, it should be noted that the true success should be measured by a remix of \\"All I Need\\" that was performed a year later with Mary J. Blige.  The song spread like wildfire, reaching number 3 on the charts, and created the feel good memory often associated with Meth's murky, cannabis smoking, hardcore performance.<br /><br />NOTE: I have honestly never used a single drug, do not promote the use of any drugs, and everything I have learned about usage has been from music, movies, and drug prevention programs.d replaced the wet dog smell left by P.L.O.

0307454541|1.0|This is my second review of this book - Amazon didn't publish my first review, and the only reason I can guess that they didn't is because I listed the myriad sexual crimes and cruelty to animals that the book dishes - and my review was probably unprintable as a result.<br /><br />There is a lot of \\"noise\\" in this book - the plot is inexplicably complicated and I'm wondering if this is what people like about it. But, the bottom line about this book is: it is about cruelty.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book was really good like all his others. Theres romance and a little suspense. I didnt like his one as much as his previous books but it was still a good read!
1848566190|5.0|This is a wonderful book, very well designed and nicely organized.  There are terrific reproductions of some of Struzan's most well known work, including Indiana Jones, Star Wars, Back to the Future, Blade Runner and one of my favorite posters, Big Trouble in Little China.  The book also contains cool images and info on his beautiful Creature From the Black Lagoon poster.  The book shows how many of the posters evolved in the creation process, and we see many poster ideas that sadly did not see the light of day.    Highly recommended to any fan of Struzan, and fans of movie posters.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|Can't go wrong with this watch.      Its mechanicals and sweep-second hand movement makes it feel like a real watch as compared to digital crystal watches.    The dial is very attractive, but this watch begs for a better watch band.    The 50 meter water resistance rating means you really shouldn't take a shower or swim while wearing the watch.  The Seiko 5 Sports models offers 100 meter water resistance which would be suitable for those activities.    It is tad bit small, especially by today's standards.
B003V5PPZG|2.0|I'm really not sure what happened with this album. I've been listening to Linkin Park since I was 13, and for years, I considered them one of my favorite bands.<br /><br />Fast-forward 12 years. I'm 25 now. My taste in music has matured, and so far, Linkin Park's music has matured with it...but then, this album comes out..<br /><br />It's not that's it incredibly bad - its just NOT Linkin Park. Some of the songs come off as a mix between Lady Gaga/U2 and others sound like Fort Minor B-Tracks. Like others have stated, there's maybe only nine actual whole songs. The rest is all instrumental noises that leave the listener feeling unsatisfied.<br /><br />That part that kills me the most is that when I heard \\"Wretches and Kings\\" and \\"The Catalyst\\", I got really excited about this album. It sound like Linkin Park was going in an incredible direction that would once again break ground and redefine the genre.<br /><br />Sadly, this is not that album.

0393072231|5.0|I found this book to be one of the best I have read concerning the economic meltdown our country recently experienced.  It is easy to understand, it is informative and very well written and often humerous. It also makes some of the characters stand out in a three dimensional way that puts a face to some of the issues surrounding meltdown.  I have never felt that everything was a big surprise, that no one could see what was happening and he confirmed my suspicions that there were people who could see it but there were also people in positions of authority who either didn't want to  or were too stupid to realize what was going on.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a little insight into the workings of Wall Street.
0312600844|5.0|This novel seizes your emotion and raises your thought level to place that perhaps is not where you usually find yourself.  It is a peeling back of family life...good and bad...while highlighting the \\"human\\" aspect of everyone involved. No perfection here...actually, just the opposite. However, in the closeup of how awful individuals can be, there is also a glimmer of hope that things can be renewed and reassessed and move forward.  Not to the ideal, not to the highest ground, but to a level that is liveable and to a place where true appreciation and acceptance is the norm.  And, this is what all human nature requires...NOT the surge of being the best or top of the heap....we all seek a place for ourselves...we just have strange ways of getting there and this story has examples of all the mistakes we make, over and over again.  Freedom is a voice from within us, asking us to reconsider our lives and choices and become a bit kinder and forgiving when we come up short.  There is value in everything and everyone, it is just a hard journey for most of us to take without losing the essence of who we truly may be....for better or worse...each of us has something to value.
0061537969|4.0|This book was recommended to me and I was caught off guard by the emotional impact.  Written  from a dog's point of view, Enzo embodied the care and understanding of his human family that   all animal lovers hope their pets have.

Please, Mr. Stein, a sequel!

If you get a chance to read this book, I highly recomend that you do.
B003V5PPZG|5.0|While the band claims that this album is not a political statement,  the lyrics contain a powerful message that resonates with the current times. I believe this album will reach a whole new fan base, while possibly alienating some of their original fans who have yet to mature with the band.     This album is truly beautiful, and is more than an album but a work of art.

0439023491|5.0|This book reads at a more leisurely pace than the first, taking it's time to set up the characters so when the true action is revealed you are fully invested in what's happening. It is more thoughtful and emotive than the first--which I like--yet this book is anything but slow.<br /><br />With Katness coming back from the Games, changed yet unwilling to let got of her past, you know something has got to give. The Districts are ablaze with revolution, and even the Games itself is changing. But still at it's core is constant Peeta, unwilling to let Katness go but broken by her indecision.<br /><br />Holy cow, I can't wait for the last book. Suzanne Collins puts all of the elements together--style, plot, characters--to create an unforgettable world where one girl is just a pawn in everyone else's games but begins to see that she wants to play by her own rules. It sucks you in and won't let you go. I don't know how I managed to stay out of it for this long, but there's no turning back now. Not that I'd ever want to.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Let me first admit, I really don't like vampire tv shows, I think twilight ruined the genre.  Having said that, True Blood is a different beast.  It is grown up, smart, funny, and worth watching.  I bought this for my wife, who loves the whole twilight nonsense, and we both ended up falling in love with this series. We will be buying seasons 2 & 3.
0374158460|3.0|I bought this book based on two reviews: New York Magazine's (\\"it reminds you why everyone got so excited about Franzen in the first place\\") and The Economist's (\\"brilliant\\") combined with the fact that I thought The Corrections was a very good book.  The Economist gives out reviews like that about as often as Simon Cowell, so I thought, \\"even I, who am very picky, am going to like *this* book\\".      For the first 381 pages, though, the only thing I liked was that I was coming closer to either being finished with this book or to what I thought had to be an incredibly good ending to justify the incredibly good reviews.  The characters were immature, lacked perspective and were in many ways unconvincing to me.  Walter was obsessed with overpopulation issues but directed most of his anger at the Catholic church for this problem and wanted, it seemed, to discourage people from having any children.  We humans, he makes very clear, are a \\"cancer on the planet\\".  I certainly agree the overpopulation is a problem and only growing in scope, but I had a difficult time believing a 50-year old who had supposedly spent so much time \\"thinking\\" about the issue was so unwilling to do what it takes to actually make a difference in solving the problem.  Instead of advocating policies that might actually work, such as trying to reduce the number of unplanned pregnancies in the world, he starts a non-profit to try to encourage 19-year-olds (who will certainly *never* change their minds!) to never have children.  Perhaps a 30-year old would be convincing in this role, but not a 50-year old.  As a result, it seems Franzen is not trying to make a policy argument but rather using the issue to represent Walter's anger with people in general.  Unfortunately, this did not work for me, and this is just one of many examples of unconvincing behavior by characters combined with the unsuccessful use of metaphors in this book.    Another disappointing feature of the first 381 pages was the onslaught of information about characters, policy issues and family histories, much of which was not directly or even indirectly relevant to the story.  Several minor characters and a few subplots could have been eliminated without detracting from the book.    Sexual tension -- will they or won't they?? -- also played a significant role in the first part of the book, but it often felt like a ploy to keep you reading when a good editing job could have achieved the same effect, saved us all a lot of time, and the world some trees.  Even Walter would have approved of the saving of the trees!    Finally, beginning with the section entitled \\"Bad News\\", the news for the reader actually becomes good.  Characters become people to whom we can connect rather than just people about whom we know many facts.  The theme of \\"Freedom\\" stops being so heavy-handed.  The word \\"somewhat\\" is used less frequently.  The phrase \\"significant look\\" finally disappears.  Rewards for all the time and energy spent reading begin to appear, and even better ones appear to be coming soon!     I consider myself a patient reader, but as emotionally affected as I was by the ending of this book, I gave it three stars because I do not believe the time spent getting there was worth it.  I considered giving up around page 250, and at that point would have given it two stars.  If you haven't read The Corrections, I suggest that book instead, but many people (not including me) found the characters to be unlikeable.  If you are impatient, or prefer your books to reward you all along the way, as I believe they ought to, skip this one.
B003YLK2RI|3.0|When I heard that this was coming out on DVD and not Blu ray, I though to myself, why? My iphone 4 can record in HD for gods sake. There is no reason why this can't be shot in HD. Yea ok, so if it came out on Blu ray, people will bash it for not being up to PAR with other Blu ray concerts. It's hard to win either way. But I can't see there being as many problems than if it was just a cheap Blu ray release. Chimaira's recent CD/DVD release was shot in HD. It isn't blu ray, but it looks nice for a chimaira concert. Good enough.     Someone over there has everything shoved so far up Corey Taylors rear end, there's no Stone Sour concert DVD's, Disasterpieces hasn't been released on Blu ray, now this... whats the problem? Slipknot fans have no money? Whatever the reason is, this is just another link in the sucky chain of \\"maggot\\" releases.

B003V5PPZG|5.0|Just like Minutes to Midnight you have to listen to it more than once. The first song I got to listen to was The Catalyst and at first I wasn't that excited about it. Now I can't stop listening to it. I'm finding the rest of the songs follow suit. I'm a big Linkin Park, and music, fan and really encourage you to give it a chance!<br /><br />The album is a bit more techno-ish than Linkin Park usually is. But definitely has a groove to it. As another review said it's an experience not just a CD.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|This is the 2nd headset I own from Turtle Beach...my first was the Ear Force PX1 which I still have. I purchased a 2nd PS3, so needed another headset...although I was happy with my first PX1 I wanted to be fair and see what else it out there as good or better within the price range of $100 and with the features of hearing both in-game sounds and chat via the headset.    My search didn't need to be too extensive as I found once again, the competition doesn't match what the Ear Force PX21 has to offer.  I love the sound, the features, the comfort, etc. no complaints when it comes to this headset.    My recommendation is...buy it and you won't be regret it.
0439023513|2.0|Everyone ends up either mentally deranged, severely depressed or dead!  Horrible ending, depressing book.  I LOVED the first book, couldn't wait to read the second.  The second book was O.K., no fireworks but definitely better then the last book.  I wanted to poke my eyes out.  All the characters that you fell in love with had horrlble demises.  Katniss who was once our inspiring heroine, ended up a depressed woman who wrote off beloved Gayle (who I really wanted her to end up with...he was always by her side, could read her and never judged her). Katniss then seemed to just \\"settle\\" for the psychotic mentally impaired Peeta.  Nothing happy in this book.  Even Finnick got a raw deal.  I could go on and on about the book, it made me so mad!!!
044654759X|5.0|I own every book Sparks has written and I was getting a little worrisome with the sad emotional endings. When first starting this book I thought I saw the plot as one of similiar writings however WHAT A SURPRISE! he puts a new twist to this book and keeps you turning pages! I sit down one evening after dinner intended to read for just a little bit and the next thing I know it is 2 AM and I have read it!!!!!!!!!!  I Loved it very interesting, some of his scenes has calming effects for me the ocean etc. I will agree though with another persons review I could see SCREENPLAY written all in this book. I hope Sparks doesn't start writing for screenplays and let his reading fans down in the future. I think you will be pleased with the ending I was. If you like Sparks You will like this book.

B000OOF3BS|1.0|This used book came from Gani Perolli in New Jersey.  The book was listed as used in good condition.  When it came it was so old that all the pages were brown.  That I could overlook, but the musty smell was more than I could take.  Disappointed that they would send a book  with such an objectionable smell.....They did tell me to return the book and they would reimburse me, but the nuisance and cost of sending a 5.99 purchase back was more than I wanted to do.
0802798225|3.0|ROMEO & JULIET get yet another run through the rinse cycle in Simone Elkeles's  imperfect PERFECT CHEMISTRY, a watered-down good girl/bad boy fantasy straight out of Hollywood.  In this case, the setting is suburban Chicago, where the beautiful Brittany falls (despite herself and her precious reputation and her harridan mom) for the local gangster Mexican-American, Alejandro (a.k.a. \\"Alex\\").<br /><br />Brittany fights gamely, of course, because the across-the-tracks romance is against all odds (though the reader knows better).  She already has the perfect boyfriend, Mr. Football Golden Boy; the perfect hair, an every-hair-in-place get-up; and the perfect house, big and perfectly appointed.  Imagine her chagrin when this handsome Mexican gangsta crosses her path in the high school parking lot with his motorcycle. Keep imagining when the tough-as-nails chemistry teacher assigns this same rake as her lab partner.  Quickly, the dialogue falls into the old Sam & Diane routine (for those who remember the \\"love you/hate you\\" back-and-forths from the old television show, CHEERS).  Soon, though, the two begin to break down each other's defenses.  Soon, love is in the air (and, in time, in a few other places).<br /><br />Kudos to Elkeles on one count: she gives Brittany a sister with cerebral palsy and makes her the focal point of Brittany's life.  Yes, it can be faulted as a gimmick -- the hidden truth in this \\"everything's perfect\\" girl's life -- but it at least is a wrinkle seldom marketed when trading in cliches like this.  Overall, however, the alternating point of view chapters look too similar, as Alex accidentally sounds like Brittany with a Spanish accent at times.  For instance, he at one point identifies lipstick colors by their crazy names (as marketed by the cosmetics company) in complimenting Brittany's selection.  This kind of detail no self-respecting guy would pick up.  He might note a color change, but as far as knowing the crazy names as if he himself is a habitue of cosmetics departments?  Ah, no.<br /><br />The end gets all corny and unbelievable as it jumps through hoops for the requisite happy ending.  This book has an audience and knows how to please it, after all.  PERFECT CHEMISTRY came recommended to me by teachers in an on-line discussion of YA fare, but it is not appropriate for middle school classroom libraries due to the profanity and sexual situations.  Girls who want to believe that there are idealized good guys running around in wolves clothing, however, should be pleased with Elkeles's outing.  The formula is familiar and, in that respect, does not disappoint.  Otherwise, don your safety glasses and be forewarned in advance -- cliches are the catalyst in this \\"opposites attract\\" mix.metics departments?  Ah, no.

0374158460|5.0|Believe the hype.  This is an instantly absorbing, exquisitely smooth expedition into the psychological maelstrom of a modern American family.  While not a perfect novel (its charm is firmly anchored in convention), it delivers a deeply rewarding emotional wallop in the midst of an intellectual carnival ride.  Anyone familiar with \\"The Corrections\\" will recognize that Franzen has improved upon his strengths.    There are certainly parts of the novel that flagged a bit, but I attribute this to my own prejudices and literary tastes rather than any particular fault of the novel itself.  When you compare it to other novels available today, this one is easily a cut above.  Take a few days and read it.

0451530829|5.0|\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.<br /><br />After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.<br /><br />At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.<br /><br />Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.<br /><br />And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).<br /><br />Modern readers tend to be unfairly squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").<br /><br />Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.<br /><br />\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings.

B001AX9DT0|5.0|Having never heard of Ray LaMontagne I didn't know what to expect.  I am now a big fan!!  This is an awesome CD.  His voice is smooth as honey and music is delightful.  I fully recommend this CD. Love Amazaon.com as well!
B000JML7EC|5.0|I'm 34 and somehow managed not to read Treasure Island all these years. Even at the grand prize of $0 on the Kindle I had to think about it for a second. I need not have done that. I am not a pirate nut, but believe me when I say this book is a must read. The vernacular is spot-on, even a century later. The pace is cut-throat fast and the characters believable, none more so than the rightly famous Long John Silver, or Barbecue, and that is the reason for the book's greatness. Here we have one of the most complex, fully developed characters you can find. One that will still ring true, even today. You WILL be swayed by him, surprised by him and ultimately, without giving anything away, impressed by him. Fifteen men on a dead man's chest, Yo ho ho and bottle of rum! Drink and the devil have done for the rest, Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!

0385333846|5.0|A perfect novel?  No.  Nothing's perfect.  A brilliant novel?  Yes.  One of my favorites.  Why?  Because Vonnegut had the ability to create humor amidst tragedy.  And the storytelling is told in an unpretentious manner.  Gems scattered throughout this meandering tale but left exposed for others to discover.  This is a literary gift that only an accomplished calculated writer can deliver.  Vonnegut was no dummy.  In this novel he created a literary device that was - and still is - ingenious.  Simply put, it is an anti-war novel in which the mind of a prisoner-of-war veteran becomes, as Vonnegut says, \\"unstuck in time\\" - with no control over where he will be next.  Maybe not everyone can relate, but I certainly can.  It influenced me to become a novelist too.
B00004YRQA|5.0|bought it because it is compatible with kingdom hearts re: chain of memories, some large memory cards are incompatible with some games (some games have issues with 3rd party memory cards, and some don't support larger capacity cards), so having a sony branded 8mb card (some of the claimed sony memory cards (128mb) aren't truely sony) is always nice to have around.
0156030470|5.0|A deceptively simple novel that explores the meaning of life.  Written in a stream-of-consciousness poetic style, this is a book that should be read slowly, not at the pace of a traditional novel, or you will miss the slow-motion explosions of beautiful insights lurking about when least expected.  Her characters move like spirits in the material world.  And as the reader - the voyeur transported to this other dimension - you hear and feel them brush past you like ghosts - who will sometimes pass right through your heart.  Unequivocally, this is my favorite novel.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|This set is a very good purchase whether for the CD or the DVD, both are great.  Yes, the voices of these two great artists are not what they used to be but for me that adds to the realism of the live setting. Doing the concert and having the original back up band , Russ Kunkel, Leland Sklar, and Danny Kortchmar was a huge plus.  Then throw in Peter Asher producing and how can you go wrong.  These great oldies are so well done.  Sit back, watch and listen and enjoy.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B003V5PPZG|1.0|This album is really bad. I'm not gonna try and make excuses for the band. This is like a mix up of techno, some whiny EMO band and a bunch of random sound bytes from different places. I'm glad I only paid 7 bucks for it, anymore and Id have to punch myself in the head repeatedly just to forget the fact that I bought this crap album for any more than that. Do not get it, save yourself the trouble, the headache and the heartfelt disappointment in another band in today's music industry.
0312600844|5.0|\\"Then many false prophets will rise up and deceive many. And because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold. But he who endures to the end shall be saved.\\" -- Matthew 24:11-13 (NKJV)<br /><br />Freedom is the best new work of fiction I've read so far in 2010.<br /><br />Freedom looks at the pain, responsibility, and potential involved in doing what appeals to you . . . regardless of the cost to anyone else. It's a worthwhile trip that manages to touch on a wide variety of ways that freedom pulls us in some directions and away from others. There's plenty of food for thought here, parceled out in bite-sized nuggets that you can chew on for weeks to come.<br /><br />I was particularly impressed by the story's narrative structure. As the book opens, you see the Berglund family from the outside-in, the neighbors' view. Very quickly, one set of patterns are disrupted into a totally unexpected direction, drawing you irresistibly into wanting to know what happened.<br /><br />In part the answer is that no one who isn't in a family really knows what goes on in a family. In another part, it's that people keep secrets from one another . . . particularly what they see as their own dark sides that they don't want others to know about.<br /><br />From there, the story richly expands into four narratives, by narrators whose connections to others are rich and hard to grasp . . . even for themselves. It's only by overlaying the narratives that the whole picture begins to emerge. At times, you'll want to shake one character or another into doing something different, but of course you cannot do that with a fictional character any more easily than you can with most real persons.<br /><br />Jonathan Franzen is a well-read author and a talented writer so his narrations dig deep into a variety of literary sources and methods to establish mood, color, imagery, emotion, psychology, physical sensations, and experiences that you'll find seem more than vaguely familiar . . . even when you cannot exactly place them. It's all subtly and humorously done, by an author who loves people and wants the best for them. There's a warm heart underneath all the Sturm und Drang that is what ultimately sets the book apart.<br /><br />I was pleased to see that the book takes seriously such important subjects as marital love, friendship, sexual attraction, depression, sibling rivalries, parental mistakes, social responsibility, and serving one's fellow human. Rather than treating each topic as a single point of light, Mr. Franzen steps back to give you a globe's eye view from both without and from within. It's at once both terrifically subjective and wonderfully objective.<br /><br />Be careful that you don't read any reviews that get into much of the story. You need to be surprised in places for this book to work its full magic on you.<br /><br />Bravo, Mr. Franzen!t's all subtly and humorously done, by an author who loves people and wants the best for them.

B00004RFFS|4.0|A compilation of Anne Rice's Vampire series, written by Rice herself. The Vampire, Louis [Brad Pitt] tells the story of his life as a vampire, his companion and nemesis LeStat [Tom Cruise], and their daughter Claudia [Kirsten Dunst], spanning over two centuries in just two hours in a surprisingly coherent way that captures much of the spirit of the original books. An excellent film and an excellent introduction to the new breed of vampire, who is no longer seen as evil incarnate but a breed similar but different from humans, with their own moral code, who love and hate, who have only a few of the weaknesses of the old school vampires like Count Dracula. Definitely required watching to understand the history of vampire movies. You can read more about Interview and other horror movies in our movie wiki at channel-kdk12.
0439023513|5.0|The third book in this series was just as great as the rest! I loved all of it. The ending did seem a bit rushed and the author didn't go into much detail about the characters as I wanted, but overall this was a great read! Would love to see it made into a movie!
B00180R06I|5.0|Vampyr is an excellent movie, and an excellent example of the Der Sturm movement in 1920s and 30s Germany. This surrealistic telling of the vampire tale is filled with tormented dreams within dreams, and is a call to fight inexorable evil, to sacrifice oneself even though it appears hopeless. It is symbolic of the movement's fears surrounding the rise of the Third Reich, which forced many of its members to flee for their lives. As a vampire movie, a surrealistic piece of dream horror, and a warning cry, Vampyr works brilliantly. Too bad not enough people listened.
0439023513|1.0|My teenage daughter loved the first two books and was counting the days until the third book would be released.   However, it was a huge disappointment to her.   Without divulging the ending to those who haven't read the third, there were twists and turns and events that happened to characters that seemed unnecessary at best.       If you haven't read Mockingjay, our advice is don't you will be happier making up your own ending ;-)
0439023513|5.0|I thought this was a great final book in the series. It wrapped everything up well, though not as you might expect. It was a great end to a great trilogy.
0553805371|4.0|The Grand Design by Hawking and Mlodinow is a tight well-written summary of science and western thought that seeks to put to bed once and for all the notion of intelligent design and God as necessary ingredients to explaining existence and reality.  Highly recommended reading for the layman and technician alike.  I take H&M to task in their overarching attempt and make the case that they have, at best, achieved identifying only the next turtle in the stack.  This all is explained in my longer review `God Gets to Stay' at [...].
1416972242|4.0|The hunt continues for Valentine in this, the second installment in the Mortal Instruments series. Clary, Simon, Jace, Isabelle, and Alex are back along with a host of old and new characters.   This installment ups the ante and brings more surprising twists, as well as more questions. This book is definitely action-packed and secondary characters are now brought to the forefront. We also get a more detailed look at the Shadowhunter world.   Clary is still getting used to the idea that she is a Shadowhunter, but she has to learn quickly if she wants to stay alive. Surprise revelations from the last book make this one more interesting in regards to the dynamics of several relationships. It's intriguing to see what is going to happen, and what boundaries have been laid down. What happens when certain boundaries are crossed? Well, you'll just have to read the book to find out. Quips fly when Jace and Simon are together. Their banter is witty and amusing and keeps the story moving when the action is low.   All in all, City of Ashes is an absorbing read. It is full of exhilarating action, and just the right amount of slow scenes to have you wishing for more. This is definitely an excellent follow up to City of Bones.

0765326353|5.0|I have been reading Sanderson's works since Elantris and they just keep getting better.  I'm not sure if I like \\"The Way of Kings\\" more than the Mistborn Trilogy but it certainly is close.  Yes, this book is over 1000 pages and when I first saw it I thought it was just simply huge, but it read incredibly fast and once I was done I was wishing there had been another 1000 pages to continue.  The next book can't get here quickly enough. Sanderson is easily one of the best authors of his generation!
B00005O3VD|5.0|By the mid sixties Barbra Streisand was one of the world's biggest singers, selling more albums than any female vocalist of her era, sometimes selling more records than the Beatles and Elvis. She also had made a name for herself on Broadway in \\"Funny Girl\\". So, it was only natural that when \\"Funny Girl\\" hit the big screen Barbra would be cast again in the role of Fanny Brice, a stage comedian who makes it big on the New York stage while attempting to have a relationship with Nick Arnstein, a handsome man who gambles.<br /><br /> Probably one of the biggest movie musicals in the history of the American cinema, \\"Funny Girl\\" solidified Streisand as a bonafied movie star. This title was even more cemented when she won the Academy Award in 1968 for Best Actress, making this one of the rare occurences when a singer won an Oscar. The film would go on to be the top money making movie of the year eventually accumulating over $50,000,000 at the boxoffice.<br /><br /> Some of the more popular songs in \\"Funny Girl\\" are Streisand's signature songs, and they include \\"People\\", \\"Don't Rain On My Parade\\", \\"My Man\\", and \\"Secondhand Rose\\".<br /><br /> Bonuses on the DVD include Song Highlights, Bonus Trailers, and the featurettes \\"Barbra in Movieland\\" and \\"This Is Streisand\\".<br /><br /> A sequel to \\"Funny Girl\\" called \\"Funny Lady\\" was released in 1975 and starred Barbra and James Caan, but was far less successful.

B0000TB014|5.0|As an uptight, middle aged white guy, I am hardly the typical MJ fan.  But, I loved him as much as anyone.  His talent was so enormous that I am not sure it could be contained within a mortal soul...what a loss...    He danced, he sang, he emoted.  His care about others, even if it had a political slant, was visceral.  WHen his best or 2nd best album came out (Bad) and the snobs of Harvard cited it as the worst album of the year...well I knew that some people would never convert and come over to Michael...but I did.  Like Sammy Davis, it was hard not to note his incredible skill set, his appeal to all, and his humanity.  May he rest in peace...    This DVD is an absolute must for any MJ fan, having all of his great hits in one place, a great bargain...
0681979844|5.0|There are any number of versions of the Complete Works out there; this is a handsomely bound, nicely printed volume.  The paper is thin but not bible-thin, the text is small but not unreadable, and the printing is sharp and clear.  Very much a no-frills book, with no illustrations or other extras, but still nicely put up and worthwhile.  The cover does not match the photograph shown here; it's the same color but the gold stamping is less ornate, and there's a portrait of Shakespeare in the center of the cover (also in gold, of course).  The book measures 9-1/4\\" x 5-1/4\\" and is 2-1/2\\" thick, with guilt-edged pages.  A better volume than you'd expect, based on the price.

0439023513|5.0|As an adult, I almost certainly have a different perspective and take on Suzanne Collins' series than the younger audience for whom it is intended.  With that said, I marvel at the layers of meaning she provides in her trilogy.  _Mockingjay_ is, as one would expect, a powerful conclusion to the series, with loose ends tied together and a marvelous epilogue of sorts.  Having survived a second Hunger Games, Katniss finds herself at the center of what has become an all-out revolution against the Capitol.<br /><br />After being kidnapped by Area 13, Katniss is separated from Peeta, who remains in the hands of the Capitol.  This plot device was a bit frustrating (Peeta's change was not only difficult to read, but at times a little over done, I thought), but certainly highlighted the similarities between Area 13 and the Capitol in their use of the couple for their own ends. The violence and intrigue is similar to that in the Hunger Games, but here the fighting is waged on a national scale - I could not help but miss the analogy.  Katniss, to a great extent is manipulated as a symbol of the resistance - a showpiece.  Again, this is reminiscent of the purpose of the Hunger Games (a symbol of the power and authority of the Capitol, the players manipulated and dressed up as showpieces before the fighting began.)<br /><br />Collins, in the concluding chapter, makes a biting criticism that resonated powerfull with me.  Katniss, reflecting on what has happened to her, thinks, \\"I no longer feel any allegience to these monsters called human beings, despite being one myself.  I think that Peeta was on to something when about us destroying one another and letting some decent species take over.  Because something is significantly wrong with a creature that sacrifices its children's lives to settle their differences.  You can spin it any way you like. ... But in the end, who does it benefit?  No one.  The truth is, it benefits no one to live in a world where these things happen.\\"<br /><br />This is as powerful an inditment against war as anything Vonnegut or Heller wrote, albiet for a younger audience.  It is a great series - a guilty pleasure to read (as an adult) - and books that I would strongly recommend to young adult readers.rful an inditment against war as anything Vonnegut or Heller wrote, albiet for a younger audience.

0312330537|5.0|The book came in good condition and in the time frame that it was suppose to arrive.   No problems with anything.
0439023491|4.0|Following the tremendous dystopian tale begun with _The Hunger Games_, Collins' sequel is less action-packed, but provides a depth of character that is uncommon in YA lit.  Having successfully navigated the Hunger Games and manipulated the Capitol into permitting two victors, Katniss and Peeta must make a victory tour to the other cities.  Yet all is not well - the President (who is vividly described as \\"smelling of roses and blood\\") threatens Katniss if she stirs trouble for the Capitol on her tour.  Of course she unwittingly begins an uprising with grim consequences - she must return to the Hunger Games to compete against previous winners.<br /><br />The violence is less graphic in _Catching Fire_, and the pace is much more meditative, but it is equally well written as the initial book in the series.  While the larger issues of egalitarianism, social class and economic inequality are less apparent here than in _The Hunger Games_, Collins does a marvelous job of exploring the characters (Haymitch in particular) and providing some backstory to the Hunger Games.  A great story, although comparitively less gripping than _The Hunger Games_, I would still recommend.
B003LAH7MU|5.0|Every Sting cd I've ever purchased, has always been a pleasure to listen to.  I highly recommend this one
B0024RI72U|5.0|I bought this album not as a Blind Guardian fan (I'd never heard of them, in fact, despite having an interest in European metal) but as a Tolkien fan, and it was definitely more than I expected.  My greatest fear was that it would be very thrashy with inhuman vocals typical of death/black metal bands, which I have never been able to listen to for long.  While Blind Guardian have very heavy and vicious moments, they are also very melodic and lyrical, and Hansi Kursch has a wonderful voice when he's not screaming.  The majority of these songs are also incredibly catchy; I keep finding myself singing along with them, despite my lack of vocal range.    I'm even more impressed with the reverence they've displayed for the source material.  I had actually just finished re-reading The Silmarillion before this album arrived, and the songs clearly recall key moments of the story in an invigorating way.  I read in the liner notes about the material they had to cut or abandon in order to get the album out, and my only complaint is that these other tracks (besides Harvest of Sorrow, a mellow but excellent bonus track on the re-release) never made it.  I would have loved to hear their telling of the Fall of Gondolin, the journey of Earendil, and the full extent of the War of Wrath and the deaths of the last of Feanor's sons.  If they ever complete the entire cycle on a double-disc album, I'd count that as a wish fulfilled.    I highly recommend this album to both Tolkien fans and metal fans, and especially fans of both.  Even if you don't particularly like metal or Blind Guardian's style, you can appreciate their effort, and it would make an interesting curiosity for your Tolkien collection.
1439148953|4.0|Had I not read this book as a part of a book club, I would not have finished it. Just not my cup of tea.     There are no great cliffhangers, not really a lot of tension, and you will not find yourself racing from page to page, speeding towards some climax. However, Tóibín's prose will suck you in.      (Without Spoilers) - Brooklyn is a novel based in the 1950s about an Irish girl, Eilis Lacey, who simply doesn't know how to speak up for herself nor how to take her future into her own hands. She moves from a small town in Ireland to Brooklyn, NY, where away from her mother, she starts to build a life for herself, but still, her inability to take control of her life continues to trap her. When a tragedy in Eilis' family happens, Eilis will be forced to finally make a decision, to determined how she wants to live her life.     What I love about Tóibín's prose is that he keeps it so visual. The writing was reserved, measured and elegant.    While it wasn't the most exciting novel I've ever read, it was certainly rather hypnotizing.
B003INJETO|5.0|I think the bases have mostly been covered in the other reviews as far as the various reactions people have had to this album, so I'll try to be concise and see if my two cents can bring anything new to the table.    Road Salt One certainly lacks much of the musical insanity of past efforts (think the ludicrously challenging polyrhythms of songs like \\"Handful of Nothing\\" and \\"Fandango\\" or the full-on prog onslaughts of songs like \\"! (Forward)\\" and \\"Idioglossia\\"). I love that stuff as much as the next guy, but I think it's important to bear in mind that many fan favorites--\\"Ashes\\", \\"Undertow\\", \\"Second Love\\", and \\"Spitfall\\"*, for example--are very simple. And that's not to say RS is completely tame, either. There is still much to be found in the way of dramatic dynamic shifts, inventive song structures, and rhythmic complexity; \\"No Way\\" and \\"Innocence\\" especially come to mind.    The one thing that truly sets this album apart from their others (for better or for worse) is the lack of any metal. No evil, de-tuned riffs. No chugga-chugga. No complex double-bass drum patterns. Even their guitar tone takes on a more fuzzy, bluesy, Hendrix-type approach. The self-proclaimed '70s feel is definitely a noticeable change.    So if I could sum my impression of this album, it would be that they have stayed \\"progressive\\" in many of the same ways, but have dropped the \\"metal\\" part of it. It's still quite diverse and inventive, still just as deep and emotionally urgent (if not more), and still boasts a breathtaking vocal performance throughout. The bluesy feel is bound to be a turn-off for some, especially in comparison to their other albums, but I think, like all of their music, it's worth approaching it with an open mind.    I'm definitely looking forward to part two! Hope my review was somewhat helpful or insightful. Sorry for all the name dropping.    *I'm joking about Spitfall, obviously, but it should be noted that there's no rap-metal on this album!

1594484775|4.0|Nick Hornby's having a good year.  His lovely screenplay for the equally lovely film AN EDUCATION is getting lots of notice, and he's returned with his best novel since ABOUT A BOY.  A pure delight, JULIET, NAKED is not only incredibly entertaining, it's also about something.  And about some things, too.  Novels about the awful burden of fame are a dime a dozen, but Hornby is going for more here.  He's curious about the WHY of fame, about fans and what they love, and because it's Nick Hornby, it's also about growing up and facing your position in the universe, even if it seems like it might be too late.  It may all seem a little light and breezy, but I would argue that's because Hornby is such a gifted and entertaining writer.  There is, in fact, a passage near the end of the novel in which a fan gets to tell the object of his worship exactly what it is he loves, and it's the best summation of the effect an artist has on the viewers of art I've read in a long time.  I couldn't read this book fast enough.  I already miss it.

0316069884|4.0|Everybody.  Should.  Read.  This.  Book.  Applying his serious and substantial writing gifts to the seriously not-fun subject of our meat industry, Jonathan Safran Foer makes such a moving case for vegetarianism (actually for disavowing the factory farm) that it's nearly impossible to turn a deaf ear.  This deeply compelling book has lots of upsetting facts in it, sure, but what's so impressive about it is that it really is a narrative about one man's journey towards making an informed and passionate decision.  That he leaves the reader so in a muddle of trying to decide how to act is a testament to the power of his writing.  I am not a vegetarian.  Nor do I want to be one.  But I will never unread (or unlearn) the things I read and learned in this book, and they may, indeed, lead me to make substantial changes in my approach to the purchase and intake of food.  The true wonder of the book is that he turns this difficult subject into something of an informational page-turner, and I actually lost sleep over it.  Again:  everybody. should. read. this. book.

0061122092|3.0|If Bridges of Madison County had been written by Richard Bach...  This novel is a test for any true cynic (or skeptic - which am I?  can't tell...).  With unabashed straightforwardness, Coelho examines religion and love and comes up on the side of . . . both, I think.  Look, if  had read this in my 20's, I might've been swept up, but I wasn't completely repelled either.  It does, however, require setting aside all cynical thoughts, and I'm just not completely able to do that.  So maybe it's more my fault than his...  Maybe.

She meets Alex, the owner of a country store who has 2 children, Josh and Kristen.  I don't want to say too much more, because it will spoil it for the reader.  Wonderful read.
0439023483|5.0|I think that I'm the last blogger to have read and reviewed this book but I finally got around to it.  This is technically classified as young adult science fiction but there were some themes that were pretty mature in it and which adults could relate to, perhaps for different reasons.<br /><br />The setting is the country of Panem. Panem is a fictional country that rises out of what once was the United States, Canada and Mexico.  It seems to be almost a post apocalyptic society in the same way that The Handmaid's Tale was.  The country consists of a wealthy Capitol district in the Rocky Mountains and twelve poorer districts who are known for certain types of industry.  The main character comes from the 12th district - Appalachia - known for its coal mining. There is a 13th district that was torn apart and literally wiped off the map by the Capitol due to a rebellion - it no longer has residents or industry and exists in name only, literally. The story takes place sometime in the future, although we are never told when in the future it takes place. As punishment for the 13th District's Rebellion against the Capitol District, one boy and one girl, aged 12 to 18, from each district is selected to compete in the Government sponsored Hunger Games, which are broadcast live on TV (think Survivor but where the competitors actually die). Each competitor, or tribute, must fight in an undisclosed outdoor arena to the death, until one remains.<br /><br />Katniss, a fatherless girl from District 12, is the protagonist for this novel. After volunteering to be the girl tribute from her district in order to spare her sister (who is selected), we follow her as she travels through the Capitol and participates in the games.<br /><br />The major themes in this novel are big government and Big Brother as well as personal independence and freedom, as the government is involved in just about every aspect of their citizens' lives. I wasn't able to put this book down for a second once I started it, to the anger and frustration of my household.

The album seems to me like they took what ever didn't make it on to \\"We Are the Night\\" and threw it on this one with a couple new tracks.  Over all it's very listenable and still pretty good, but it just seems like it was thrown together last minute.
B003W5C0VW|5.0|This is one of the greatest rock 'n' roll films ever made, performed by, arguably, the greatest rock 'n' roll band ever during, unarguably, their creative peak.  Some things not mentioned that really impressed me:  Keith, the rock 'n' roller for life, is so into the music that he spends much of his time facing the drums, playing directly to Charlie.  Jagger's musical professionalism really stands out.  There are many instances where he makes a point of not hogging the limelight when it's the other musicians time to shine.  Sometimes it's just by turning his back to the audience during someone's solo.  Other times, when the spotlights just don't want to move away from Jagger, he'd move over behind the soloing musician to force the light onto them.  When Keith starts singing \\"Happy\\", Jagger not only turns his back to the audience, but points a wagging finger at Keith to get the obstinate spot operator to illuminate the right musician.  And there was that moment during Bobby Keys' sax solo in \\"Rip This Joint\\" where Jagger starts to move away from Keys, but then comes back to adjust Bobby's microphone.  The mark of a true professional and something you just don't see much at that level of the music world stratosphere.    Taylor's solo during \\"Love In Vain\\" proves by itself what a great guitarist he is.  And there is one short phrase in his \\"Street Fighting Man\\" solo that should make send rock guitarist into ecstasy. Can you figure out which one it is?    If you are anywhere CLOSE to being a fan and/or student of Rock 'n' Roll, you need to see this movie.

B003JTHESA|4.0|I kinda feel like the tri-guitar setup hadn't quite gelled in the last few albums.  I definitely think it has come together now.  The guitar work on this album is awesome and quite well integrated.      From the catchy pop like title track to some of the more ballad style tracks everything feels like it hangs together musically.  I'm especially fond of the heavy and dirty riffs of El Dorado.    Unfortunately I feel like Bruce is lost in the mix on some of the songs, and there are spots where he seems to be struggling to make the lyrics work with the music phrasing.  I'd deem it more poor lyrical writing than a failure on Bruce's part, but it's hard to say.    I'm dating myself when I say I've been listening to Maiden since the start; I can honestly say this isn't their best work ever.  I suppose I'll always be more of a fan of the Iron Maiden through Powerslave era, however this is definitely the best album of the last three or four.  It really combines the best parts of Dance of Death, Brave New World, and No Prayer for the Dying for me.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Bliss. This is the feeling I was left with after watching North & South. It's a long, hard journey to that complete satisfaction, but it is one that is both necessary and wondrous.<br /><br />From the very beginning, the music of this movie swept me away. It is grand and hauntingly beautiful, and it seems to echo long after the movie is over. The sounds truly capture the emotional depth of the various scenes. They emphasize the authenticity of the feelings and make them that much more moving and real.<br /><br />But it wasn't just the music that stood out to me. It was a combination of a great many things, especially the acting and the cinematography. I was both drawn into the story and drawn close to the characters. The pain that they felt, the struggles they faced, and the hope that somehow endured . . . all of it was inspiring.<br /><br />I simply loved how this movie portrayed real life--including the raw anger, the aching need to survive, the longing for justice, and the blossoming of passion. I was reminded of so much that I'm sure no matter how many times I watch it I still won't completely grasp all that I can learn from the movie. I was shown, not simply told, the importance of not judging others, of having compassion and being willing to seek understanding. Through the contrasts between the North and the South, I saw how people have different perspectives based on where they come from. Through the growth of John Thornton and Margaret Hale, as well as some of the workers, I saw how people could learn to respect each other and truly show love. And I loved every minute of it.<br /><br />This is a movie that will stay with you and leave you with an ending and overall impression so beautiful, you will be in a state of bliss.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|Since the boxed (not the crappy package with the free toy) Blu Ray set was going for less than the complete set in DVD, I finally decided to upgrade. And boy, am I glad I did. Yes, it's shaky, dark and grainy: it was shot that way, but the space battle scenes are beautiful and the sound is clear and immersive. I haven't watched all yet (just on the third disc), but so far the only problem I've found is a small glitch that causes the last 3 seconds of a deleted scene to loop. I don't know if I'll get a replacement since the rest plays perfectly.<br /><br />Since this series wasn't meant to look pristine I doubt I'd upgrade from DVD, but if you're buying it for the first time why buy the lower resolution for around the same (or higher) price?

B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|Since the return to Disney of Pixar's John Lasseter, they have produced some of their best animated features in years! Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue continues this renewed commitment to excellence in animation coupled with great storytelling. Voiced again by the fabulous Mae Whitman, Tinker Bell comes back for a third movie with the story of a very special girl (Lizzy) who not only believes in fairies: she has been drawing them and reading about them since she was little. She runs into Tinker Bell through a \\"happy\\" accident and the rest of the movie ensues as the two become friends.<br /><br />Though understandably my 7-year old loved it, I admit I also liked it quite a bit! The lessons and feel-good tone of the movie don't fall behind great production values (I still struggle with the soundtrack, but that is a different story!) resulting in a highly enjoyable animated flick. Bonus features include a pretty extensive Fairy Field Guide Builder, deleted scenes, access to the Disney BD-Live Network, a music video and more. Not as special as the movie itself, quite frankly, but then again I am not the 7-year old in the house. :)<br /><br />Overall, I like it about as much as the first one and more than the second Tinker Bell movie.
B000KGGIQY|5.0|If you are a fan of Johnny Cash and look at this as a replica, a re-creation of his life, you will love both the movie and the sound track.  Having watched his career and life since the time of Sun records, the early days, I was thrilled with the acting which took you through the years, the songs that were done so well and the events that brought Johnny Cash from the lowest to the highest point in his life.  His life is a tribute to the strength and ability of the human spirit and that a complete turnaround can be done with love and faith.  I will treasure this movie and sound track for bringing to life significant things that made Johnny Cash what he was.  A man that did learn to walk the line.  Loved it.
B003SWNRU2|5.0|This CD has an energy, quality, and power that has been missing from so many so-called \\"metal\\" releases over the past few years.  No Udo on vocal but this is a stellar traditional metal album.  The riffs, solos, compositions, and most of all the POWER are stunning.  I do not seek the voice of Udo here (I can find that on various UDO discs), take the new singer for what he is and framed up as a new ACCEPT sound.  But the core of this album is the core of ACCEPT.  Fantastic rejunvenation of a classic metal band, can't stop playing it and can't stop head-banging like the old days.  This FAR surpasses anything recent from IRON MAIDEN, JUDAS PRIEST, PRIMAL FEAR, and the like.  I hope this receives the recognition it deserves from both older and younger head-bangers, assuming they still exist!  ;)
1416589473|3.0|I am a GuildWars player- I follow the blog, play the game, and keep up with the lore.  I am eagerly awaiting the release of GW2 sometime before the Mayan predicted apocalypse, and I have fond memories of traipsing around Tyria with my toons and guild mates.    I am also an avid reader and a fan of the fantasy genre in general.  I like to read different takes on different universes and see what fresh and exciting things can be brought to life out of existing material.  This novel is one such attempt to branch out and bridge the gap between the two games, add some flavor to the world, and give us information in a way that we don't have to play for it.      It is a solid, middle of the road fantasy novel filled with all the required elements.  A ragtag band of heroes.  A double cross.  Evil bad guys.  Fantastic treasures.  And even a world-wide conflict that rages in the background and serves as a backdrop to the whole thing.  But it stumbles as well.    It feels as stiff and wooden as a middle school production of Romeo and Juliet.  The characters are two dimensional with all the trimmings.  Angry Charr, wounded hero, curious Sylvari, blustery Norn, and the arrogant Asura.  The book felt too contrived, not full of any challenge, and the story was wrapped up too nicely.  We have a great premise and a wonderful set-up only to be let down in the end by something that feels very \\"Choose-You-Own-Adventur-ish\\" in its simple prose.      More time was spent trying to introduce the new things about GuildWars than was spent telling the story.  The book is aimed at fans and players- and as such much of the elementary introductions could have been done away with.  We already know- and for those that don't...they won't be picking up the book anyway.    The story had so much potential but just seemed to fall flat.  I hope the next outing will be better and more tightly written.  Now that the universe has been introduced to us...again, perhaps we can get to the meat of the story andstart exploring one of the best fantasy settings to come along in quite some time.  I am choosing to see this book for what it is intended to be- a setup to introduce the world of GW2 and a new Tyria.  I am hoping the next books in the trilogy really tell a good story- one that won't matter what game it's based on.
0399536108|5.0|\\" Be daring, be different, be impractical, be anything that will assert integrity of purpose and imaginative vision against the play-it-safers, the creatures of the commonplace, the slaves of the ordinary. -Sir Cecil Beaton    That quote is in the \\"Conclusion\\" section of Mr. Chris Guillebeau's book, \\"The Art of Non-Conformity: Set Your Own Rules, Live the Life You Want and Change the World.\\" It made me cry. The message, his message, while not truly unique, is something that he puts together so eloquently that it resonates strongly.    Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying that Chris isn't unique because he is, but as I finished reading his book earlier this morn, I realized that I had been highlighting sentences and marking almost every quote in the book with stars. When I got to very last quote by Martin Luther King, Jr., (which is one of my favorites by the way), I realized that others, many others, have shared this philosophy just not in the same way. And so what Chris brings to the table is his perspective, goals and love for this idea. That alone makes the message meaningful.    I can't entirely explain why I cried after finishing Chris's book, but I did. I was simply overwhelmed with emotion.     When I began reading Chris's blog in May of this year, I happily embraced. I found Chris, or maybe Chris found me, at the right time.    So back to the point, my review of the book: it is a MUST read for anyone and everyone out there seeking, questioning and overall doing. Chris's manner of writing is very approachable--he writes the way a friend writes to another friend-offering help, hope and sincerity. The book is easy to read and has great points and questions to ask yourself as you continue to grow.    Of course this book isn't for everybody and Chris makes a point to detail that, but this book is for the people out there struggling to make something happen without knowing how or why.    I especially enjoyed the chapter on legacy. I think this may be why I started to cry. See, I've been told many good things about myself as well: how I make people feel comfortable, am confident, have given confidence to others, etc, but I've always never felt like that was my offering to people, nor did I ever take it without feeling awkward. However, in the past year and a half, I have been lucky enough to find my footing-my offering to this world and one of them is continuing to be a force that comforts people. That is part of my legacy. We all have a legacy, it's just a matter of making sure we keep it moving. Chris offers ways to help you find and continue not just your happiness, but your own path. That's part of his legacy. One that will greatly force you to shake up your own world, which is never a bad thing. In other words, it's well worth the read.
B002WYH5N2|5.0|I am a great chick flick fan.  I love Jane Austen's books.  I have watched many versions of her books made into movies over the years. This is my favorite book and my favorite version of this film.  I love the extras they have on the DVD showing the houses that were used for the film and talking to the actors and actresses about the film.
B00005O438|5.0|..the others being \\"The Shining\\", \\"Dolores Claiborne\\", and \\"Carrie\\".  Aside from its silly cover art, this is a hands-down classy flick with a complex story adding psychological strain to an already overbearing calamity.  It's true most movies don't live up to the book, and I read Cujo, the novel, long before I saw the film.  But I'd have to say the movie is better, much better in fact.  The novel isn't actually one of my favorite King stories..  So what makes this film better than the book?  The acting.  The 1983 cinematography is nice as well.  But it's the acting building over a suspensful, intelligent and fast moving plot, that leaves the deepest impression.    Dee Wallace, who plays the mother in this one (she also starred in \\"The Howling\\") is just excellent.  Never have I seen a woman portray such fierce devotion to a child as her performance in this movie.  She should have won an Oscar. Kudos also go to the boy who plays her son.  His performance is on par with the little boy Danny in \\"The Shining\\", his terror at once utterly convincing and heartbreaking, to go along with his mother's.  Don't be surprised if you shed a tear.  The two of them JUST steal the show.  Oh, did I forget the dog?  He did a great job too!  One of the things that's so scary about this film is that nothing about it is based on the supernatural (as was also the case in Dolores Claiborne).  The dire situation that the characters find themselves in are without logic loopholes, adding to the overall beleivablity of the scenario.    If you haven't seen Cujo, do it!  It works as a great psychological drama as well as a horror film.  If you don't jump out of your seat at least twice during this movie, check your pulse!

1577314808|5.0|For years I have tried to understand why none of the current organised religeons make total sense, then I read The Power of Now and I'm beginning to see why. It's one of those books in which certain portions leap out and are highly relevant on the first read then, having absorbed that information, on the next read more and more of the writing 'slots in' and makes sense.  This is a new way of thinking about spiritual advancement; one that places the responsibility for the future of human life and all life in fact, firmly with each individual. Organised religeons take power away from us as indiviuals and place a barrier betweeen us and God.    The book tells us how to identify the 'ego' within, how to watch for the incessant thought processes that invade most of our NOW; then gradually find and enjoy increasing brief periods of peace. Tolle explains how time can be useful 'clock time' where we use the vital experiences of the past to plan the necessary actions for the future. He differentiates this from 'psychological time' when our egoic mind's thoughts contantly relive the past, and fritter away the NOW planning a future dependent on that past.    Tolle's book has already made a huge impact on my life and I would heartily recommend it to anyone searching for sense and reason in this world of strife and   madness.

Enhanced by some very good acting,<br /> -- especially by Sigourney Weaver -- some very sharp writing, and director Jon Amiel's<br />skillful modulations of the ups and downs of tension and emotion.<br /><br />That said, the film's strengths are slightly undermined by a few annoying contrivances<br />in keys spots, a few awkward moments, and an ending that doesn't quite work.<br />But this is still still way better and meatier than most of it's genre.

0553805371|4.0|In this book, the authors offer a highly speculative set of ideas in what amounts to yet another attempt (see, e.g., The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins and God is Not Great by Christopher Hitchens) by some scientists to rule out God as having anything to do with creation or the universe at large.  But if the question comes down to what is probable, the authors' speculative theories or the existence of God, The Grand Design turns out to be a powerful argument for the existence of God.<br /><br />The authors here seem to have lost faith in the ability of science to reach a final theory of everything.  Instead, they adopt what they call model-dependent realism, where working models become scientific reality, presumably until scientists find a better model. The authors' choice for the best going model is M-theory, what they call a \\"family of theories,\\" which includes string theory and inflationary cosmology.  Two notable -- and bizarre -- features of M-theory are that it calls for 11 dimensions (as opposed to the three we are accustomed to, four if we include time), and  10E500 universes (10 with 500 zeros). These multi-universes, we are told, sprang from quantum bubbling that occurred sometime before the Big Bang.<br /><br />With M-theory as their chosen model, the authors then take on the anthropic principle -- the remarkable observation that the physical laws and constants of nature appear tuned just so life can exist.  Another way to express the principle is that since humans require a given set of physical conditions to exist in the first place, our being necessarily constrains the physical conditions we experience. In either instance, it may seem odd that this universe is so conducive to life.<br /><br />But now equipped with the multi-universes, the authors find a way out of using God as an explanation for our seemingly human-tuned universe. In one of the many multiverses, they conclude, the laws of nature would inevitably turn out the way they did. Isn't that convenient?<br /><br />Another scientific -- and logical -- principle, known as Occam's razor, states that in devising scientific theories, \\"entities should not be multiplied unnecesssarily.\\" With their multiplicity of universes, offered as a materialistic solution to the anthropic principle, the authors have blunted Occam's razor into uselessness. If M-theory turns out not to be the right mega-theory and all those dimensions and universes don't really exist, we are left with the unavoidable fact that the universe appears highly tuned to allow life to grow and prosper.  In short, we are left with suggestions of a God.scientific -- and logical -- principle, known as Occam's razor, states that in devising scientific theories, \\"entities should not be multiplied unnecesssarily.\\" With their multiplicity of universes, offered as a materialistic solution to the anthropic principle, the authors have blunted Occam's razor into uselessness.

B003VSVWA0|3.0|I love Leonard Cohen! I am ashamed to admit how many times I've listened to and viewed his \\"Leonard Cohen in London.\\" But this DVD, \\"Songs from the Road\\" is, in my view, much inferior to \\"Leonard Cohen in London.\\" It does have new songs, but what is missing is Cohen's wonderful rapport with the audience, and with his players, which the \\"London\\" dvd exhibits. The sweetness of Leonard Cohen, mixed in with the darkness and shadows that accompany almost every song, is displayed in the London dvd, not only through the songs, but through his remarks to the audience, through his praise for each of the players in his band, and through the camera, which follows him and his band loyally and lovingly, punctuating the carefully planned rhythmic patterns.   \\"Songs from the Road,\\" by contrast, is uneven. Sometimes the stage is so far away that it is hard to discern the individual players. At times the audio quality is inferior. The \\"Hallelujah\\" song is much more inspiring and coherent in the London dvd. \\"Closing Time\\" is also much more grandly executed in the London dvd. Whereas the London dvd manifests deliberate variations in the tempo and themes of songs, \\"Songs from the Road\\" is mostly slow and dark. Indeed \\"The Partisan\\" is a great song, but it is an exception. What I am missing most in this dvd is the warmth and the exuberance of Leonard Cohen in London. Even the \\"Backstage Sketch\\" by Cohen's daughter, Lorca, is disappointing. It seems that as she followed the players around, no one particularly wanted to talk, except for Dino Soldo (a wonderful wind instruments player who is not given his due in this dvd). It is a \\"sketch\\" indeed, and a dull one at that. She does not even interview her own father--which is probably not her fault. So, in sum, the performances are uneven, the songs are not very exciting, and the brilliance of the London dvd is dimmed by shadows. If you can buy only one of them, buy the London dvd, without question.
0307346617|5.0|I'm a big fan of the zombie genre and after hearing the author interviewed on NPR I knew I would really like this book. From what I understood from the interview, this book details or mimics real life scenarios that may be used for wide spread epidemics; just replace zombies with your epidemic of choice. The book is written in short stories from the individuals who lived through the outbreak. I found it to be an interesting read and hard to put down. This is my first book from this author and I plan on buying some of his other books.

B0040QYROA|5.0|Having loved every release of Metropolis since I first saw the Moroder version with Queen's music in college, I was quite excited to get the opportunity to see this newly restored 2 and 1/2 hour version with the 16 mm reduction negative of the original premiere cut of the film, including almost all of the lost scenes, that were found in the archives of the Museo del Cine in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The Cleveland Museum of Art showed it in high definition with a new recording of the original score.  It was marvelous!  The additional footage (which is rather grainy, making it evident which parts came from the 16 mm negative) included: the adventures of 11811,the worker who trades places with Freder; the Thin Man spying on Josephat; Maria's incarceration; Rotwang's gloating and Maria's subsequent escape; and scenes which establish the longstanding rivalry between Joh Fredersen and Rotwang.  The added sequences made a tremendous difference to the flow of the story!  I can't wait to add this to my collection.

0374158460|5.0|Looking over the forceful exchange of ideas here, I wonder if the measure of Jonathan Franzen's achievement is the energy he injects into his readers. While giving the book five stars, I acknowledge many points made by the negative reviews: the characters are not exactly \\"lovable,\\" and the book contains much political preaching. I have something to say about politics in the book, but first I want to list what I liked best.<br /><br />Jonathan Franzen describes life situations with appalling accuracy. Examples in this book: accepting friendship from someone damaged, because you need friendship so badly. Falling in love with a cruel, empty person because they are cruel and empty, because winning them will set you apart, because they have more power than you do. Trying as hard as you can to escape from people like your parents, only to marry someone even worse. Divorcing your spouse and facing a lifetime of hurt, regret, and uncertainty regarding your decision.<br /><br />Naturally, the author is at his best when describing situations he's familiar with. The more like Franzen you are - in age, gender, social circle - the more interesting his observations are likely to appear to you.<br /><br />About politics: I'm just an average, distant reader, so I'll go out on a limb here. I do not think Franzen is interested in politics for their own sake. He wants to show us what strong ideas do to the lives of people who are passionate about them. Walter's obsessions--with endangered species and population control--shape him as a person and, in great measure, ruin his life. Similarly, the characters' political prejudices, liberal and conservative, prevent them from making friends or getting what they want. They are blinded by these ideas. They are so busy filing their perceptions  politically, they can't see the world as it is.<br /><br />I'd like to read other readers' thoughts on this subject. Thank you for reading my review.

0345350472|4.0|The twin peaks of Dick's vast oeuvre are this novel and [[ASIN:1400096901 A Scanner Darkly]]. Unlike Scanner, this novel still bears the imprint of Dick's early work. Just like [[ASIN:0679736646 Ubik]] and [[ASIN:0679736662 The Three Stigmata Of Palmer Eldritch]], it is crammed full of quirks and plot details. In addition to the main storyline, in which a bounty hunter named Rick Deckard pursues fugitive androids, there is a post-nuclear landscape; a religion centered around a modern human with Christ-like overtones; a culture that values live animals above all things; a creepy TV personality; devices that regulate people's emotions; and so forth. Some of these elements don't work as well as others -- for instance, I'm not sure the novel gains a lot from all those hallucinatory sequences involving Mercerism. The usual cutesy, unnecessary neologisms also pop up: \\"conapt\\" instead of \\"apartment,\\" \\"homeopapes\\" instead of \\"newspapers.\\"    For the most part, though, Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep? does a much better job of keeping control over all of these wild plot strands. Other Dick novels tend to throw them around without doing a whole lot with them. But this novel devotes a significant amount of time in the beginning to setting up the post-nuclear landscape, explaining the history (even saying \\"nobody remembered why the war had started\\" is better and helps to set the mood more than saying nothing at all) and consistently returning to the religion and the animals. These are important recurring themes, not one-time ornamental details. A surprising amount of emotion is invested into them. The great thing about Dick is that he's always deadly serious, even when describing absurd or goofy things; by contrast, [[ASIN:038533348X Cat's Cradle]] by Kurt Vonnegut also depicts a religion that is pretty similar to Mercerism, but always keeps turning it into some kind of cute joke. But Dick's novel is genuinely dark and affecting; he describes Deckard's efforts to procure alive animal in a straightforward and realistic way, and his despair at having to tend to an electric sheep is palpable.    The main storyline is also quite strong. The tone is very similar to classic American noir fiction, with terse, [[ASIN:1883011078 Chandler]]-like pacing and dialogue. The manly loner Rick Deckard evokes much the same effect as [[ASIN:1883011086 Philip Marlowe]]. His brief exchange with the androids in the final showdown has strong undertones of moral disgust and disappointment, much like Marlowe's reaction to the thugs and criminals he encountered. In fact, Dick's obsession with the idea of people losing or being unsure of their identity evokes the paranoid atmosphere of classic American detective fiction by [[ASIN:1883011671 Hammett]] and Chandler. In Hammett, it's always hard to tell whose side the protagonist is on, and Dick's sci-fi trappings are just a way to emphasize and intensify this same basic feeling.    The [[ASIN:B000UD0ESA movie]] streamlined most of the details, of course -- the religion, the animals, the entire subplot with radiation victim Jack Isidore -- but it was generally faithful to the noir-like feel of the main storyline. There is only one major difference between the movie and the book, but it's a fundamental philosophical difference. In the movie, the runaway Nexus-6 androids are depicted as noble, suffering antiheroes. Rutger Hauer's brilliant, soulful (and completely improvised) dying monologue implies that the androids are actually more sophisticated, and feel more deeply, than human beings. Their suffering has elevated them above humans; it is the humans who are placed in a position of trying to understand these superior beings.    Dick's novel passionately insists on the exact opposite view. There is a crucial scene where the androids mutilate a spider in Jack Isidore's apartment, solely out of callous, unfeeling curiosity. They also appear to take smug satisfaction in Isidore's discomfort. This scene proves beyonda shadow of a doubt that the androids are inherently incapable of genuine human emotion. They may imitate human relationships and camaraderie, but they cannot even empathize with each other, except in the form of shared rage against humans. They come across as dangerous sociopaths, convinced of their superiority over humans, and yet trapped by their own limitations. For instance, Jack Isidore, who is viewed as stunted and inferior by other humans, has a much deeper emotional capacity than any android. In a way, the androids' downfall occurs due to their own extreme pride; it is the tragedy of someone intelligent enough to reach for a high status, but inherently unable to measure up to it.    Dick uses the character of Phil Resch to toy with the idea that the bounty hunters might actually be androids without knowing it. I don't know about Resch, but I think there is no ambiguity about Deckard's identity. He is not an android, precisely because he is able to feel pity for them. This is reinforced by the last mention of Rachael Rosen; the androids are doomed to forever try to destroy human happiness out of envy and spite, whereas the humans are able to bear and overcome these hardships and try to rebuild. When you think about it, the humans should have a heavy burden to bear for creating these unhappy beings, but this angle is never explored by the novel. Perhaps it would have clouded the stark message: the androids are rebelling, not so much against humans, as against their own nature.    This is a powerful work with a vital place in American literature. Dick wrote best when he had a big canvas to work with. The book has a classic, traditional plot at its core, but the use of sci-fi elements gives the dark atmosphere an all-pervasive totality.
B0040ZPLBY|5.0|This is one of the best tv shows around. It takes place when Merlin and Arthur Pendragon were young men in Camelot.<br /><br />Plot.. Merlin has magical powers and arrives at the city of Camelot, after his mother arranges for him to become an apprentice of Gaius. He discovers that the king, Uther Pendragon, has outlawed magic and has imprisoned the last dragon deep under the city. The dragon informs him that he Merlin has an important destiny to protect Uther's son, Arthur, who will bring forth a great Kingdom. When he meets Arthur for the first time he discovers that he is arrogant and a bully, but after he saves Arthur's life, he is reworded with a job in the Royal Household as Arthur's manservant, and they become close friends. Arthur is unaware of Merlin's magical ability, as Merlin has to keep it a secret or face execution at the hands of Uther. Morgana is Uther's ward with the power of prophetic foresight, which frightens her and which she keeps secret. Gwen is her maid servant and close friend. The first series focused on the development of Merlin and his friendship with Arthur. The second series focuses more on development of the other cast members. Some of the central themes of the series are the budding romance between Arthur and Gwen and Morgana's struggle to control her powers. Other characters from Arthurian legend have appeared. Lancelot longed to become a knight, but unable to do so because of his birth as a commoner.

B00005JM02|5.0|My great-grandson Devon is at the age where he's entranced by cartoons, so I bought a used version of this movie in order to be able to buy him more.    He lives in another city, but his mother told me he loves it so-ooo much. She said his eyes grew round as beach balls as the breathtaking underwater world of Australia's Great Barrier Reef unfolded before his eyes. His mouth flew open when Nemo was captured by a scuba-diver and got separated from his father, a nervous clownfish named Marlin. Then as the adventure progressed with Nemo meeting a scatter-brained blue fish named Dory and on through all kinds of wondrous, colorful critters--including sharks, jellyfish, sea turtles, pelicans and more--Devon fidgeted with pleasure...and anticipation...    I saw this movie years ago and loved it. Since Devon and I are kindred spirits (I'm a big kid at heart), I thought he would enjoy it and am delighted that he does.    Since 1,049 other people reviewed this movie before me, there's not much left to say, but it made Devon happy and kept him entertained (a big help to his mother, I'm sure)...and that's good enough for me!    I'm very impressed with the awesome job Pixar does with all its movies; from animation to voice-overs to graphics, these filmmakers can't be beat! Pixar, as you might know, is the Academy Award-winning creator of \\"Toy Story 1, 2 and 3,\\" \\"Monsters, Inc.,\\" \\"It's a Bug's Life,\\" and more.

B00004OCQ2|4.0|Let me begin by saying that I believe that Badlands 2nd album \\"Voodoo Highway\\" may be one of the best (and most underrated) albums of all time.  The songwriting is superb, the musicians are in top form, and the production is top notch.  The album is raw, aggressive, unflinching blues based hard rock, complete with a remake of James Taylors \\"Fire & Rain\\" that gives you chills every single time you hear it.    That being said, Dusk does not quite reach as high as Voodoo Highway did.  I suppose my exceedingly high expectations for this album were fueled by years of searching for and not finding it.  On first listen, I felt disappointed.  BUT, after listening again, and again, and again, ... I am now enjoying this final recording by Jake E. Lee & Co.      Here are the downsides:      1.  The vocals are very strained.  Ray Gillen seemed to be losing his range and raw power by this time.  Given that he passed away shortly after recording of AIDS related illness, that comes as no big surprise.      2.  The guitar sounds very \\"thin\\".  I am not sure if this was to compensate for Gillen's weakened vocals, or if it is the product of weak, or little to no, production, but given that Voodoo Highway had such a meaty, high octane guitar scream this albums more subdued, restrained sound is bound to be a letdown.    Now the upsides:    1.  Just like Voodoo Highway, the songwriting is excellent.  It is obvious that this foursome was really clicking as a group at this point, and the songs show it.  The lyrics are solid, and each musicians influence is heard in the fluid way each blend their individual talents together into a single, very tight package on each track.    2.  The rhythm section is exceptional on this album.  Fans of Badlands were probably drawn in by the fame of guitarist Jake E. Lee, but I am sure many are pleasantly surprised to hear such phenomenal work by bassist Greg Chaisson.  Chaisson takes his strong performance on Voodoo Highway to a completely new level on Dusk, showing how truly talented he is.  Powerful without being overbearing, Chaisson's bass lines are unequaled here.  Chaisson lays down a thunderous undercurrent that replaces the missing rhythm guitar track normally recorded under Lee's lead guitar.  At times you catch yourself following the the bass lines and and ignoring the leads.  Complimenting Chaisson is another decent performance by (Racer X) vocalist turned drummer Jeff Martin.  Martins work is a bit \\"loose\\", to the point some consider it sloppy, but his style fits the music they are playing perfectly and ends up feeling genuine, and enjoyable.      It's too bad this album appears to suffer from abysmal production.  It is fairly obvious that this album was released to cash in on the desire of fans to hear one last set of tracks from the late Gillen, and get their hands on one more album from a truly amazing, highly under-appreciated, band.  With a little professional attention, this album could have sounded much better.  This band should reunite and record again with a new vocalist.  If you like Badlands, or like your hard rock with a heavy dose of the blues, this album is decent, Voodoo Highway is genius.
B000035Z3K|4.0|Finally a really clean copy of this early talkie.  Enough has been said about the film, so I won't go into that.  The bonus features are wonderful.
B000025XKM|5.0|I first heard the last piece, \\"From the Morning\\" on the famous AT&T commercial with the pseudo-Christo orange drapes.  I fell in love with the music and checked to find out more about this incredible artist.  His life was way too short.  He only released three albums in the early 70's before dying of a drug overdose at age 26.  The music is thoughtful and sad with a haunting soul quality.  This artist didn't live long enough to see his music appreciated.  In his words, \\"It's beautiful!\\"
B002ZG99N6|5.0|Hard boiled bank heist movie, that's here. Bad guy wants to change, that's here too. Great acting. Even with actors in only a single scene, stick in the memory. Chris Cooper in red, devil or victim? Great action without the computer trash. Chase scenes in Boston's North End that could happen, and that bridge is right there, so it doesn't insult people that know. But above all, Ben creates a film that treats the actors and material well. The crowd at the theatre loved it. Charlestown looks great. Lehane's got a new book coming, let's hope Ben gets a chance at it.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Killer tracks:  1. Bleed it out  2. Leave out all the rest  3. Shadow of the day  4. What i've done  5. Hands held high  6. Little things give you away  7. Wake  8. Valentine's day     Good tracks:   1. Given up  2. In between  3. In pieces  4. No more sorrow    The good part: Not a single bad track. Even if you don't like some tracks immediately, they'll eventually grow on you.  the bad part: What is LP trying to accomplish with the new use of profanity? Fit in with the other bands? Disappointing.

There are very few movies that could be this exciting and thrilling as Point Break. I loved everything about the picture: the acting, the surfing and skydiving scenes, the radical mentality, the characters, and the adrenaline. Watching Point Break every time makes me want to go out and jump 15,000 feet in the air. Two mentions of Point Break are desired: Patrick Swayze and Kathryn Bigelow. The former should have been given accolades for his role as Bodhi. There hasn't been a truly likable villain in the likes of Bodhi since Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber from Die Hard. Not only Bodhi is likable, I just wished things have turned out differently. He is a villain, period. The latter, Kathryn Bigelow...this gotta be the first time ever that I know that a female director that actually made a thrilling, exciting action picture. That's a groundbreaking directorial effort. I found the acting in Point Break to be excellent: Keanu Reeves, Lori Petty, Gary Busey, John G. McGinley, and Bodhi's friends, not to forget to mention the arch-rivals including Anthony Kedeis of Red Hot Chili Peppers. If anyone wanted to be thrilled by a movie, one of them has to be Point Break. Hands down, Point Break is one of the best action movies made. I can't believe it's been 15 years since Point Break was made, and rarely an action movie has met the standard of Point Break. When I think of movies in the likes of Point Break, XXX, Days of Thunder, and The Last of the Mohicans are the movies that come to my mind.
B003V5PPZG|4.0|well let me start, album is great. well different linkin park but sounds great. i see alot of ppls hating thing album cuz they went so into techno and hip hop than their rock style. i like the idea that they chnage their music.. tells me they are growing as muscians and trying something new....  why keep doing the same style over and over. i can say the only thing i didnt like about the album was the skit tracks. 6??

B00003CXB4|5.0|pure classic disney. After looking for hours in various stores only to find out that nobody carries it, my last hope was online. some people wanted a ridiculous amount of money for a simple dvd. although the special platinum edition runs a little more expensive than most dvds it's still great and i couldnt be happier with it.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|Well worth owning on BR, even if you already have the SD-DVD versions. Superior thrillers (they actually have thought behind them), with excellent acting and action. The latter two, directed by Greengrass, are less well filmed -- far too much shakey-cam work -- but all three work well, both as stand-alone thrillers, but more importantly, as a single story spread over three films.

City of Bones  is a fabulous beginning to The Mortal Instruments urban fantasy series.  An action packed, character driven novel of friendship, love, loyalty, and betrayal and the consequences of knowing the truth.  Filled with fabulous paranormal creatures, endearing characters, hot romance and unexpected twists that will leaving you gasping for more.  This is a must read for urban fantasy and paranormal romance fans!<br /><br />I recommend City of Bones (The Mortal Instruments, book 1) to readers of paranormal romance, fantasy, science fiction, young adult, and especially to fans of urban fantasy.
B0021L8V1G|3.0|SPOILER ALERT!<br /><br />Word has it that Robert Downey Jr. requested the screenwriting services of Justin Theroux, who was one of the writers of Tropic Thunder.  Tropic Thunder was hilarious.  Iron Man 2, overall, was not.  It seemed like a poor attempt for Robert Downey Jr. and Justin Theroux to make Iron Man more comedic.  Jon Favreau should have known better.  While Iron Man has some funny moments here and there, the character is not supposed to be funny overall.  We had some light moments in the original film that worked really well.  But in the end, Stark was true to his goal and he took it seriously.  In this film, Stark seems to take nothing serious at all.<br /><br />Iron Man 2 tries to be a lighter movie than the previous one, while taking on a \\"darker\\" spin on the character of Tony Stark and his new nemesis, Ivan Vanko, aka Whiplash.  Iron Man 2 fails on both fronts.<br /><br />Iron Man 2 isn't nearly has fun and innovative as the first film; a movie that had plenty of action and charm, with enough characterization for Tony Stark, Pepper Potts, and Obadiah Stane.  In this film, Iron Man casually makes only a couple of appearances, and it isn't enough to keep the audience involved.  Tony Stark dominates the film.  We see very little of Pepper Potts at all, and what could have been a great character in Ivan Vanko, is all but placed secondary to the very goofy Justin Hammer, poorly played by Sam Rockwell.<br /><br />Tony Stark's battle with alcoholism is addressed here.  In the comic books, it is tragic, and we see the fall of a great character and his battle to overcome it.  In this film, they chose to make Stark look like a buffoon.  He spends his time drunk, dancing around ridiculously in his Iron Man suit, and even making a silly bathroom stunt by \\"showing\\" his fellow party friends how Iron Man goes to the bathroom in his suit of armor.  It doesn't work.  The laughs that the filmmakers were hoping for were sporadic at best when I was at the premiere showing.<br /><br />Ivan Vanko is actually a combination of two villains...Whiplash and the Crimson Dynamo.  They actually set up a good premise with this character; a Russian man who is the son of an inventor who worked with Tony's father.  When tragedy struck Ivan's father, he obviously holds Tony Stark responsible and vows revenge.  Taking on the mantle of \\"Whiplash,\\" and utilizing the same technology that powers Stark's Iron Man suit, Vanko creates two energy whips that can cut through metal like butter.  It's too bad that we're only given one short battle between Iron Man and Whiplash before, in a very predictable fashion, Vanko ends up fighting Iron Man in, guess what?  Another suit of armor!<br /><br />In the comics, Justin Hammer is a cold, ruthless man who views Stark as an obstacle that must be removed, since he runs a rival company.  Instead, we're treated to Sam Rockwell who makes Hammer look clueless in anything he does.  It's truly sad that one of Iron Man's premiere villains was reduced to this.  Normally, I don't like to bring up comic book comparisons, but in this case, they completely missed the boat with this character.  Rockwell plays Hammer like he, himself, has no idea what the character is like or what he is supposed to be about.<br /><br />Don Cheadle takes over as Rhodey and he does a good job with the character.  We are treated to the addition of \\"War Machine,\\" the armored superhero that Rhodey becomes.  Gwyneth Paltrow's character didn't have enough screen time, and her interactions as Pepper Potts with Tony Stark are too few and far between.  This is a shame because these two characters worked very well in the previous film.  The light banter between Potts and Stark in the previous installment is nearly gone in this film.<br /><br />Another great character that we see way too little of is Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow.  People seemed to wake up in their seats when she finally takes to the screen in her tight, black outfit and making shortwork of a score of guards when she breaks into Hammer's facility.  Too little screen time hurt the characterization of what should have been an interesting character.  Many superhero films make the big mistake of having too many characters.  This film finds itself among those.<br /><br />Iron Man 2 has a few redeeming things that keep it from becoming a total failure.  The actions scenes are, for the most part, well done.  Unfortunately, we see too few of them.  The attention to detail as Iron Man soars through the skies in the original film have disappeared in this film.  It's too bad.  So many people were in awe when Iron Man first takes to the skies in the first film.  The special effects are still top rate.  It's too bad there wasn't a good enough story to go with it.<br /><br />Iron Man 2 has its moments here and there.  It's worth one viewing, but frankly, I'm casting this one aside with Spider-Man 3, Superman Returns, Ghost Rider, and some of the other \\"failed\\" superhero films.  I don't know if any recent comic book film held such anticipation for its fans, and ended up being such a bitter disappointment.<br /><br />With Favreau, Downey Jr., and the rest of this talented bunch, they should have been able to deliver.

1439181780|4.0|Liked:  There was a few more things to learn that will help you find the path you are seeking. However I would say that if you are to buy just the secret you have it all.     Didn't Like:  I found this book was mostly a repeat of the secret.  However the few added items were important to me.    I would say always worth the read you might find things I didn't see. I would recommend looking at the teachers featured in each book and look up what they have to say as well.
B003NX6ZDC|5.0|Brandon Flowers solo debut shines through every song. The Killers frontman is exuberant and overjoyous yet heartfelt and smooth. All the songs have that special something to them. Its a great album of great lyrical prowess, melodic hooks and catchy synths.Some songs are louder and more poignant then others like Crossfire and Fabolous Las Vegas that pays homage to his hometown.All in all an album not to be missed!
B003XSWL3A|5.0|If you already have the original 2-disc version of this title and/or their five studio albums then you pretty much have all the Simon and Garfunkel you need. The first two discs give a good overview of the duo mixing their hits with some album cuts and live performances. The third disc consists of one track from each of their studio albums plus a track from their 2004 album \\"Old Friends: Live On Stage\\". What's disappointing though is that these tracks only total about fifteen minutes-not even close to half the disc's maximum length so I felt more tracks could have been added. I'll only recommend this title to anyone who doesn't want the trouble of getting the other albums in their catalog. If you're a die-hard it's a little repetitive but still a good collection overall.    TT Disc 1-42:54   Disc 2-55:09   Disc 3-14:59
0061876747|4.0|No doubt William Boyd is a terrific writer.  His prose is tight and at the same time invests weight and foreboding in ordinary, day-to-day events.  He also uses language so as to give the impression of an \\"inside look\\" at how things--spy networks, conspiracies, multinational corporations, criminal gangs--\\"really\\" work, even when it isn't.  In Ordinary Thunderstorms, Boyd makes an attempt at the thriller genre, and, fortunately, he brings these skills with him.  They are well-deployed and make this an enjoyable read, a good cut above an ordinary thriller.  On the other hand, Boyd has not mastered the pacing (too plodding), the plotting (highly derivative, have you seen The Fugitive?), or the denouement (can you say \\"anti-climax\\") of the thriller genre.  So good, but not great.

0553805371|3.0|The Grand Design<br /><br />By Stephen Hawking<br />and Leonard Mlodinow<br /><br />Book Review<br /><br />By Richard E. Noble<br /><br />Stephen has got himself in trouble once again. Mr. Hawking has decided to join in the ancient argument about the existence or necessity of the gods.<br /><br />Stephen didn't actually say that there was no God. He merely stated in the manner of Laplace, another infamous mathematician, that he also \\"had no need for such a hypothesis.\\"<br /><br />Stephen is of the opinion that the Universe is the result of a \\"Big Bang\\" and that this Big Bang was able to create itself ... from nothing.<br /><br />Although Christians and many other organized religions also believe that the Universe was created from nothing they disagree with Stephen in their definition of the \\"nothing\\" that is somehow responsible for the Universe.<br /><br />Christians and their counterparts believe that the nothing behind the Universe is God - a supernatural being portrayed in the image and likeness of Man. This God is also nothing because he is yet to be defined credibly. In fact, all attempts at a definition have led to paradox or irrational contradiction. So God remains an unconfirmed suspicion that is only visible to the faithful.<br /><br />Stephen's \\"nothing\\" is explainable scientific phenomenon which satisfies all his equations without a fallback position of God a la Isaac Newton. The notion of God, in effect, posits the impossible as explanation for the highly improbable. Stephen does not add God to his equations because he sees no point in solving a mystery with an even greater mystery nor does he find it necessary to do so. If we suggest that God created the Universe then one must ask who or what created God, states Stephen, philosophically.<br /><br />This has sent the religious community into spasms of stuttering, stammering and hallucination over fundamentals. Stephen is able to do this because of his reputation as \\"the most intelligent man alive.\\" Whoa, that is scary!<br /><br />What surprises me is that no one seems all that upset over the fact that Stephen has also denied the concept of free will. Stephen said, rather flatly, that he believed not in free will but in \\"scientific determinism.\\"<br /><br />The denial of free will is equally important to the religious community of theologians because without it how can non-believers and other undesirables be sent off to hell. And furthermore, without the notion of free will how can God be relieved of personal responsibility and become the source of all that is good, free from any evil related to his creation of man.<br /><br />Stephen tries to back off on his denial of free will by making a qualifying statement. Stephen suggests that because of an infinity of choices man is sorta possessive of a free will ... kind of. But to show where this copout leads, we find Stephen later in the book claiming that if a robot could be designed with the ability to make an incalculable number of choices it too could be considered, by Stephens's definition, to be possessive of free will ... kinda sorta.<br />I should think that the religious apologists would be jumping all over that one also.<br /><br />And now we come to the Grand Design. The Grand Design has been the goal of the scientific community since Einstein and Heisenberg and the problems created by discoveries in quantum theories.<br /><br />Scientists have been searching for one theory or one equation that would unite all the four known forces in the universe: gravity, electromagnetism, strong nuclear forces and the weak nuclear forces. So far they haven't been able to come up with one. But Stephen says he has it. He calls it M-theory.<br /><br />M-theory is not \\"a\\" theory but a scientific series of overlapping theories (models) which take into consideration via a multitude of Richard Feynman \\"fudge factors\\" every possible theory conceivable.<br /><br />To me M-theory is somewhat akin to stating, \\"I have the answer to existence and why we all exist.\\"<br /><br />\\"And what is that answer?\\"<br /><br />\\"The answer to existence and why we all exist is that there is no answer.\\"<br /><br />M-theory is based on Stephen's definition of reality.<br /><br />Stephen denies that there is such a thing as objective reality or absolute reality. Reality is in the eye of the beholder and if the beholder's reality can be backed up by scientific experimentation to justify what he thinks he is seeing, one observer's view of reality is as good as another's.<br /><br />We fall into the same trap with this definition of reality as we did with Stephen definition of free will. Stephen even goes so far as to say that the Ptolemaic view of the solar system is as viable as the sun concentric view. The only difference being the ease of the equations or math involved.<br /><br />As with his scientific determinism, I find his scientific reality also lacking.<br /><br />Scientific reality is based on observation backed and substantiated by scientific experiment. Stephen gives an explanation of realism that is about the worst description that I have ever read. It is so bad that I question his motivations in this regard.<br /><br />But moving right along, Stephen rejects any a priori knowledge or conclusions with regards to reality. To my understanding an object has a reality in and of itself independent of any observers or perception. In other words, if there were no one and nothing to observe any real thing in the universe that thing would remain what it really is. A tree would be a tree even if there was no one or nothing to observe it. The sun would still be the sun and the stars would still be whatever they are. Observers are not necessary to this understanding of reality.<br /><br />But Stephen is a scientist and not a theorist or a philosopher [Stephen says that philosophy is dead] and he accepts only a reality spawned via observation and corroborating scientific experiment. Models concocted through a plethora of observers and compared and evaluated via scientific experiment and mathematical equations present the only reality possible. It doesn't really matter if the concluded realities are true or false, since no picture of reality can be determined to be absolutely true. They only have to be computer, model soluble.<br /><br />So once again Stephen comes to this strange conclusion that a fish in a fish bowl's confirmed observations are as viable as a human's scientifically confirmed observation of any particular object. This leaves us with no absolute reality and reduces reality to a matter of opinion ... sorta.<br /><br />From Stephen's point of view, man's view and understanding of the things around him become constrained and restricted to the laboratory and mathematical equations that can be diagramed on his computer.<br /><br />Stephen's view of reality may be distorted in this way because of his physical condition. He sees a reality confined and restricted just as he is confined and restricted.<br /><br />I see an objective absolute reality in a thing's existence in and of itself with no perspective or point of view necessary. Of course, this absolute reality is indeterminable - but nevertheless it does exist. It is reality and we all know and understand it.<br /><br />It is the goal of science to discover this absolute reality with its inadequate powers of observation and scientific experimentation.<br /><br />The average of all the approximate realities of all the various scientific observers is an estimate of reality and not reality, per se.<br /><br />Reality is not the sum total of all the various and inadequate points of view of the myriad of observers combined and mathematically formulated. It may be the best that man can do, scientifically, at present but these scientific estimations do not constitute a true reality - as of yet. I think the M-theory with all it machinations will come up short in the long run.<br /><br />A tree is a tree, in and of itself, no matter how it may appear to you or anyone or anything else. A tree is not necessarily what any particular group of observers, no matter how large or scientifically inclined, estimate it to be.<br /><br />Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Aothor of:<br /><br />\\"Noble Notes on Famous Folks\\" Humor - satire - facts.termined to be absolutely true.

B000J5XS3C|3.0|I bought this for live performance.  It's a good quality mixer, with a few caveats:    - The light is way too bright.  I had to put white out over it to prevent myself from going blind.    - The cord has a tendence to slip out.  I had to tape it.    - I bought the 802 since it has a separate phones / control room bus.  But it seems pretty worthless.  You don't get any phones or control room output unless you turn up the main outs.  My whole point in using phones is so I can set a premix or practice without sending anything to the mains.  So my solution is to use the main outs for phones and the control room for main.

But appreciation in the show was increased as they finished out the season with some great writing; maybe even funnier than the first couple of seasons. I am looking forward to  catching these, I just have it set for recording right now.  I got to like this show by the end of the first episode. For a couple of years I never missed an show since I am recording them except for the season I purchased, where i missed a few of them. I wasnt too impressed at the beginning of the third year but then it got better.

I didn't want to have to take the MOBO out to install this fan which is what you will have to do as another reviewer mentioned.  It is very quiet and the temp went from 127F on each core to 100F each.  It does take up a lot of space and as one reviewer mentioned the instructions are very lean.  I used my own standoffs on my existing mount because I didn't want to remove the MOBO and the standoffs that come with it wouldn't fit.  It's in, it's quiet and it cools very well.  I just wish the instructions were better and you could just do a swap out with the existing cooler mount.

The first 4 chapters rehash the works of others over the past century, why they thought what they thought were they got the idea from and who improved it later on.  Really do we need another example of of what was explained before?  One last comment, the authors should stick to physics, their humor is quite lame.

Franzen does a great portrait of a discontented, bored suburbanite in his protagonist, Patty Berglund.<br /><br />What I liked was Franzen's choice of a theme that we don't see too much of in recent literature - the exploration of a relationship that I would call \\"blood brothers\\" - two men who are not related, and not homosexual, but whose personalities are so meshed that they are closer than actual brothers.  He does a good job of showing how both men benefit from competing with each other as much as they love each other...and really shows us the envy underlying the love.  The author also shows us how the \\"blood brother\\" relationship can destroy the life of a woman trapped in the middle of it, while also making Patty fully responsible for her own problems.  If anything, \\"Freedom\\" is a potent argument against poly-amory.<br /><br />The character who really fascinates me isn't Patty, however.  It's Connie.  She is absolutely driven by a single goal in life, to get married to a guy that she identifies as a \\"winner\\", one whom she has formed a soul-mate relationship with by the time she is ten, and one who she will convince to love her in return, no matter what the cost or how many years it takes.<br /><br />Whenever Connie is reintroduced to the narrative, it picks up tempo.  The psychic bondage and domination in the relationship between Connie and Joey is the perfect counter-weight to the feminism of an earlier era that Patty benefits from and Walter promises to uphold.  At the end of the story, when Patty says that her overachieving daughter Jessica is a working dog to Joey's show dog, we have no doubt by how much the submissive, underachieving Connie has left Jessica behind in the dust by marrying the \\"show dog\\".  Tolstoy was no feminist, and in this story, Franzen isn't much of one either.<br /><br />Patty says there is something \\"not right\\" about Connie that makes her hair stand on end, and this reaction is shared by the reader.  Yet I knew a few \\"Connies\\" when I lived in the Midwest - the straight-A students who followed their boyfriends from high school to college.  They had the grades to go anywhere after college, but they made sure to get accepted to the grad school where the boyfriend was, and then dropped out as soon as the boyfriend graduated.  A year or so after grad school they got the prize, after committing more than a decade of their lives without a \\"solid guarantee\\".  Of course, it helps that this Connie had a $50,000 trust fund to seal the deal, but even without it, Franzen captures a particular type of Midwestern girl perfectly.  He also shows how her mother Carol colludes with Connie's ambition - another true-to-life scenario based on my own experience.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the argument about \\"Freedom\\" is a conservative one.  Franzen may mock the evil of mountaintop removal, and indulge repeatedly in his pet liberal passions of zero population growth and \\"bad\\" outdoor cats vs. helpless birds, but he really seems to be criticizing the freedom with which we so easily follow our emotions if it feels good.  Anyone who doubts that this is the heart of the conservative argument should check out the essay on Jane Austen in \\"10 Books Every Conservative Must Read\\" by Benjamin Wiker.<br /><br />Sometimes the author's craft is a little weak.  It is obvious Walter sold his morals out long before he got involved with Vin Haven and the Cerulean Mountain Trust, but the reader doesn't get to see this happen.  There is no sense of real dollar amounts underlying what is otherwise a realistic story - the author has Patty starting over on her own with a job that doesn't pay the rent and a $75,000 inheritance that wouldn't last more than two years, yet wants us to believe that she \\"holds out\\" against Walter without one word for six years.  Franzen is no Balzac either.<br /><br />Yet the wonderfully subversive quality of this story is what makes it a winner, as well as the good writing.  Does the story advocate for what is precious to liberals?  Does it show the ultimate failure of feminism?  Does it show how conservatives misuse freedom to do whatever they want, or does it show how liberals do the same damn thing?  You be the judge.  Why is there a bird on the cover of the literature?  When Walter tells us, the subversive laughter lets the reader \\"have cake and eat it too\\".ranzen is no Balzac either.

B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|The transfer looks good and the movie is classic Miyazaki. It's enjoyable by all ages and is great to add to the collection.
B002ZG9846|5.0|Love this movie, it is quite comical. I downloaded the digital copy to my i-tunes account. On my iPod Classic it plays great. However, on my brand new lap-top the movie stops frequently, it feels like is streaming, and sometimes skips a few frames repeatedly :(. The blu-ray is great. I play it on my Samsung BD-P3600 and my Samsung UN55B6000, and my Yamaha RX-V 1065 which all can be controlled with my Samsung remote. It is quite amazing when I play it in my system. The digital copy quality could have been better.
0143113100|5.0|I found this book exceptionally informative and written in a delightful, accessible style. I have since purchased it for a friend and recommended it to many others. I plan to read it cover-to-cover again. And it is one of the few books where I wanted to read the entire Appendix!
0374158460|1.0|This was a bad book, there is no easier way to say it.  Not sure what Oprah saw in it, or why she reccomended it to millions, except maybe she owed someone a favor?  Do yourself a favor, and dont waste your money or your time. The story is unimaginable, and the characters are humdrum.

0316098337|5.0|I''ve started my review of this book about a half-dozen times. In the book trailer (and I hope you watched it), Audrey Niffenegger writes:<br /><br />\\"Room is a book to read in one sitting. When it's over you look up: the world looks the same but you are somehow different and that feeling lingers for days.\\"<br /><br />I picked this book up around 7:00 in the evening. I put it down at around 3:00 the next morning. When I closed my eyes out of sheer exhaustion I had dreams that centered around Room. I woke up feeling dazed and heart-broken.<br /><br />Room is a book that requires intense emotional investment. That's all the warning I can give you about the story contained in this book, so when you pick it up prepare to invest in it and to lose yourself in Jack's voice. I was apprehensive for the first page or so in wondering if I could connect to Jack, the five year old narrating the story but... this worry was unfounded. I'm in awe of the power Emma Donoghue wields through the voice of Jack and think this book should be read widely.<br /><br />While reading this book I was reminded of a human interest story I'd read in the news a while back. In Plant City, Florida a 6 year old girl was found living in horrible conditions. They compared (as this story has been compared) her story to that of Tarzan and speculations were going crazy about her development and how she would be affected by this.<br /><br />While the similarities are not exact, Room brought back the memories I had of reading this story and evoked the same emotional rage I felt.<br /><br />I feel it's important to note that although this book is narrated by a 5 year old, this is not a story for children to read. This is a very adult story with adult themes. That said, I want to encourage every single one of you reading this review to move this book to the top of your to-be-read pile and experience it. There are few books that I really get the hype on, but this book is one that deserves it.
0061914177|5.0|Crush it! was very helpful to me, once I got into it, as it helped me realize there are actually two major kinds of DNA. One kind (Mr. Vaynerchuk's variety) is to be the star performer, on stage, shining brightly. The other kind is the producer (sort of) who makes the whole thing possible, and is happy being offstage, out of the limelight -- at least most of the time. This could be the writer (me) or the technical wiz who can twist the right knobs to make the product work properly; the recording technician, the stage director - well you get the idea.     Certainly, these two varieties of DNA complement each other very well. Not everyone wants to have their life spread all over all the social media, all the time. Those who do, however, presuming they actually have something to say (it has merit, and is not just blather) should by all means `go for it' and give the more shy ones among us a piece of the pie. After all, nothing happens until someone writes something! Don't believe me?  Look around you. And check out my blog in the meantime -- The Book Mechanic. Not everyone has the same DNA, and this book may well help you figure out which kind is yours. Happy Hunting!    If nothing else - it's a terrific and very helpful guide to all the various social media entities out there. If you don't get an idea or two of your own from reading this book, you may have a radically different DNA than the rest of us do. Nothing wrong with that, as long as you can happily live your own particular passion without trampling anyone who doesn't think exactly as you do.
0375851569|5.0|I bought this set for a grand-niece - I read them all to my own children & hope someday to read them to my grandchildren. This is a fabulous collection.  It's not every Dr. Seuss book you'll end up wanting (he wrote a lot more), but it sure is a great beginning. What's really great about Dr. Seuss is that the books not only help with bonding with a child, but also reading, counting, rhyming, imagination etc...and the illustrations are bold & bright (think of the animated movie \\"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\\" - another great Dr. Seuss book. Buy these books and see where they will take you & your children. Every book in this collection is on the list of top selling childrens books of all time - #4 is 'Green Eggs & Ham' & #9 is 'The Cat in the Hat' What else can I say?  It's Dr. Seuss - the best!!

B002ZG983M|5.0|WOW! Should've watched this movie at the theater. Great movie, John Woo type action. Never expected the movie to turn out like this.
B000YENUI6|5.0|A horror film that is just a plain true slice of Russian gore, as we can see it everyday in our European democracies. Prostitution, essentially of girls under age, drugs essentially as the fodder of the prostituted girls, alcoholism, violence, crime, any kind of trafficking provided it pays. The absolute impotence of the police or any authorities to stop it or prevent it is fascinating, and we may even think the absence of desire to do anything on their side might be a sign of fear. These networks of underground criminal organizations can only be endangered from the inside and the only who can get into these networks are Russians working for the ex-KGB. And that's the whole film. How does a KGB mole infiltrate such a network? The answer is slowly and the second answer is with a little bit of blood, shed by the English police if possible, I mean blood from the Russian criminals not of course blood from the English police. The film is full of suspense but without any suspense really because we know who is who, even if the people in the film do not know who is who. The suspense is in the details of the tricks, of the treachery, of the gore and of the horror each crime creates and calls for. The Chechens are sure seen as barbaric monsters but the Russians are not really better except that they do speak, and not only Russian. The end is a fairy tale because it is the victory of the good within the camp of the bad. It is Jesus becoming the head of the Roman Legion in Jerusalem. Will the Roman ensigns be planted within the walls of Jerusalem or not? Or if you prefer John the Baptist becoming Ponce Pilate. You can be sure there would be a lot of new converts. And what about Salome becoming the High Priest of the Temple? That's the trick used by Cronenberg. The film is a sad and pitiful if not pitiless pathetic vignette on the Russia mafia in Europe, since Europe has opened its boarders to the East and yet the ending is a twist in the fabric, a pirouette between two pas de deux and nothing has changed except that a king is dead and another kind is alive? Long live the new King. Louis XVI has become Robespierre. Charles I is now Oliver Cromwell. What can come out of such a crazy upside down situation? A big mess till some politicians really have the courage to say that will do and to stamp down on these cockroaches, even if it costs a few lives on the security forces' side. So far no one dares say a word, or nearly no one, because these perambulating shadowy mafias are either the descendants of the poor victims of the KGB, or the descendants of the poor victims of Ceausescu, or the members of an ethnic group that has made it a living style and an income to remain in the margin of society and suck all they can from the those who have to get up in the morning, go to work, work and then come back in the evening. It is truly a great way of life to get up after noon, do nothing up to night fall and then spend the night playing the guitar, smoking, drinking, and now and then going on a foraging trip into some deserted areas. Scrap metal is going up very fast at the present moment. By the way if these have a heart attack in the middle of their nighttime pleasures they expect public hospitals to give them freely and free of charge the best treatment they have at their disposal, and they, the nighttime revelers, deserve obviously due to the astronomically high level of contributions they have paid all along. Have you read \\"Thinner\\" by Stephen King? I would advise you to complement this film with that short novel. That would give you the picture of those perambulating wild populations that are roaming around in Europe. The tobacconist and newsagent in my village did not believe it till one night she was burglarized. You should have heard her yelling when her insurance company refused to cover most of her loss because she had no alarm on her door and windows.

This was a film of outstanding quality way back in 1938, and the DVD captured the quality.  The Blu-ray is definitely slightly better, but was it possible to achieve very much improvement on what was already first class?   In any case, worth buying.

Beyonce puts on an incredible performance, and no matter what age you are, you'll enjoy the show. There is something for everybody. It was such a thorough production too. The music, the singing, the dancing, the acting, the musicianship, the list goes on and on. Long story short, buy it and you won't be disappointed. Seriously. Oh, oh, oh!

0553573411|5.0|Picking up where the first book left off, \\"Royal Assassin,\\" the second in the Farseer Trilogy, is a sequel that's surprisingly just as good as the original. It has the same amount of drama, suspense, and occasional bits of (light and dark) humor. The only difference is that there is much more plot and character development, and there's an actual romantic subplot which is refreshingly convincing (unlike those in other fantasy novels in which the romance feels forced and looks like it's only filler). In addition, the story really progresses to the point that after you have finished reading this, you desperately want to know what's going to happen in the final installment of the trilogy. You really believe in the characters so much, that you care about them (at least the protagonists, anyway). Adults themes are prevalent, but not as much as in George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice & Fire.<br /><br />Overall, I admire \\"Royal Assassin,\\" and The Farseer Trilogy in general. If you haven't read it, then you're probably missing out on some very good stuff.<br /><br />Grade: 9/10

B003V5PPZG|2.0|Ever since Linkin Park started cussing on their albums, and using parts of Iron Maiden song titles as their album titles... they started letting me, and most of their original fans down.    I was a kid in middle school when their first album Hybrid Theory came out, and I really enjoyed it I must say. Even Reanimation and Meteora were good. And what was awesome was I didn't need a 18 year old to buy the albums for me or have to pluck them myself from the local record store. Hearing them curse is kind of odd to my ears, and I feel that their music is more towards younger girly ears then ever before, but now they have parental advisories? Hahaha, kind of a joke to me. Don't get me wrong, you could still buy the edited version, but that ruins the song in my opinion.     This new album, Brighter then a Thousand Suns, uh... I mean, A Thousand Suns, I am going to say is better then 2 Minutes to Midnight, uh woops... Minutes to Midnight,  just because they went in a different musical direction, and sounds to me like a pop-like, soft, clean, easy listening Nine Inch Nails style, but still sort of interesting. Linkin park is still missing the punch that they used to have, musically & lyrically.
B003EYVY0E|1.0|Total bummer. As a lot of people have said they won't be buying this and any future Ultimate Editions unless the Extended versions of each film are included and I agree with them. The first two HP films I purchased the Ultimate Editions mainly because the Extended Cuts were included along with the theatrical versions. Adding only a documentary is not reason enough to shell out 40 bucks or more for the same movie I already have on blu-ray.    The first two Ultimate Editions are truly beautiful sets. The artwork and all the extras really make these collector's items for any fan of this series and I was looking forward to purchasing all the films (again) on blu-ray. However, as much as I'd love to have these now, without the Extended Cuts, makes all the difference.    I hope someone at WB with enough clout sees this thread and hopefully some day soon we will be able to purchase THE truly ULTIMATE EDITIONS of ALL of the Harry Potter films.
B000UZ4CWW|5.0|Wow. I was completely bowled over at how good Slayer remains seventeen years after REIGN IN BLOOD.    This album is very intense and an excellent return to form, at least as far as Slayer's trademark brutality goes. I know some Slayer fans are upset because this albums is a bit different to the style of Reign in blood and Seasons in the Abyss, but what the heck do these fans expect? Should Slayer release the same material year after year? Get real!    This is a BRILLIANT album, take my word for it, folks. Slayer remain heavy, and most importantly, they remain an essential component of your heavy metal collection. What a treat.

The first book was really involved and had a complete feeling to it as did the second.  But the final book just left me wondering and feeling as if it was hurredly done and not thought thru well.  These are not children's  books in my estimation.  I would not encourage a child under 11 to read them.  They are quite dark and dramatic and scary at times.

B0036TGSIK|4.0|\\"Easy A\\" is a modern day teenage spoof on the serious work of Nathaniel Hawthorne, \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" written in 1850.  Emma Stone plays Olive Pendergast, a clean cut high school student who blends in with the crowd.  There is nothing special about her, although she is attractive.  All of a sudden she becomes the center of attention as the high school rumor mill feeds on a white lie she told a friend about a week-end date with a college student.  Olive stayed home with her family that week-end, but upon returning to class the rumor spreads like wildfire and she becomes the center of attention. Olive adamently denies she did anything wrong, but this just adds fuel to the wild stories.  Finally she decides to just enjoy her notariety and embrace her new risque image.  Other students come to her to help their wild reputation (although everyone is being good - they just want a reputation).  They pay her to say she had her way with them. Olive helps the situation by wearing sexy new clothes with a red \\"A\\" on her chest.  It becomes overwhelming - Olive is the most talked about person now. The rumor mill becomes too much for her and she is afraid it will hurt her family and the only high school relationship she cares about.  Olive creates a very modern fun and upbeat solution to her problem.<br /><br />The film is funny, and sparkles as Emma Stone plays Olive Pendergast with verve, independence and self aware humor.

4871878309|5.0|I agree totally with other reviewers that the title is far too narrow. This book is useful to anyone who ever has to solve any problem--does that exclude anyone? My fridge broke while I was mid-read and I decided to try out some of Polya's main strategies. Amazingly applicable. (And the fridge works great now.)     One word of caution, after a brief structured section, the remainder of the book is arranged by alphabetical topics. After skimming the first few, I assumed that they were just obvious definitions and \\"notes\\" about the \\"body\\" of the book. That was a big mistake. Much as I hate alphabetical arrangement (particularly with seemingly randomly generated titles), the alphabetical section is where the best stuff is. And the \\"title\\" of the section is no help in finding the good ones. The best way for me to think about it was to just imagine it as a blog: some days he wrote a little nothing, other days he wrote something awesome. The crossreferences within the blog entries are helpful for finding the best entries.

B001MYIXAW|5.0|As someone who trolls the reviews of various movies and music on Amazon, it's clear that a significant portion of the people writing them regularly overstate the greatness of a given work and throw out five star reviews like beads from a Mardi Gras float - so it was with cautious reservation that I finally broke down and bought \\"Let The Right One In.\\" All I can say now that I've seen it is that, this time, the five star reviews may not be high enough praise. Within two viewings this film has become my favorite film of the year (even though it was actually made in 2008) and is a much needed emotional antidote to the sterile, barren-of-charisma characters so common in American films.     Now, I'm no film snob that automatically favors foreign films over homespun stuff (I like me hundreds of domestic films), but American films that are character driven often overdo the emotional lives of their characters and are often victimized by their own lazy, predictable writing and the rush to throw in unnecessary bells and whistles - presumably because the studios think American audiences are dolts that won't accept character-driven films that are written for adults. But quiet, deliberate films don't HAVE to be boring things no one wants to see; a movie like \\"Let The Right One In\\" proves it. This film is absolutely brilliant right down the line. To start with, the cinematography is amazing, and the white, frozen landscape and postcard-like framing that characterize the film play excellent counterpoint to the moments of blood red passion both literally and metaphorically. The quiet, understated way of the film also perfectly complements the inner goings-on of the two main characters. Oskar and Eli, astoundingly portrayed by Kåre Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson (both are Oscar worthy here...or should I say Oskar), are totally believable representations of lonely, isolated kids treading the universally rough waters of childhood while seeking emotional \\"nourishment.\\" This film is fascinating. It plays with the ideas of vampirism and starvation (among many others) as metaphor for the need for love and as yet unfulfilled prepubescent passion. I'm sure these very qualities that make the film so utterly powerful will flatly disappear in the impending American remake - the quiet metaphors of starvation and emotional sparseness supplanted instead by an overly dramatic score and loud, effects-driven sequences. \\"Let the Right One In\\" however hits all the right emotional notes, is very smartly scripted, and is the most realistic and honest portrayal of pre-teens I've seen in a long, long time. In the end it's not merely an effective and sometimes very unsettling and gory vampire flick - which it is, as some of the scenes here are among the most effective horror sequences put to film recently - but it is also a touching, sweet and beautifully rendered portrayal of young love; a poetic masterwork of inner desolation, anxiety and loss; and a fearlessly dark fairytale with a final 10 minutes so emotionally powerful and gratifying I could scarcely believe what I was witnessing. Simply put: I was utterly blown away.
0439023513|4.0|After reading other reviews I thought I would be disappointed but I liked the way it ended. Seemed real - yet hopeful. The only thing I didn't like about the book was all the \\"pods\\" - and the extremes with mutts and torture etc. - that seemed to get a little old.
0553381687|4.0|This book was a random selection for our book club, otherwise, I would not have normally have read this book.  I am so glad I got the opportunity.  It is well written and I find its' pacing and format refreshing and exciting.  I found the characters that I like the most were cunning and interesting enough to where each could have a novel written entirely about them.  I did find it unexpected that the person that you expect to be the hero dies and nothing goes the way you think it will, but that is the beauty of this novel.<br /><br />A pleasant read, you will go through it fast because you won't want to put it down.

B0014Z4OQG|1.0|It has been said of me that I will watch anything.  They are wrong.  Thank GOD for DVR and fast forward.  Personnally I hate that \\"we are making a movie \\" shaky camera, even so I have watched the zombie movie made the same way, this movie had way too much jitter - Dramamine anyone.  After about 30 plus minutes of BORING film about some one relocating for some reason, it starts to get a little interesting, it then actually proceeds to interesting - It could have been, dare we say Good, and then it was over.  No who are these little monsters and where did they come from, no who is this big monster and why are they all here , and at the end a heliocopter crash and its over.  A horrendous waste of natural resources, time, and film.  The acting of most was good - they should receive an apology.

B003NWS5AO|4.0|Has Robert Plant been worshipping at the House of T Bone and Buddy? Or should Daniel Lanois be complaining \\"wait, I don't remember making this album\\"? I commend Robert Plant's desire to do his own thing instead of making another bazillion dollars with Zeppelin reunion. He fires up the engine driven by Patty Griffin, Buddy Miller and Darrel Scott and leads the T Bone mafia through a mystical prairie slow groove. Rock and roll's greatest front man has sudddenly become the wizened shaman of Americana. This album won't set your mind ablaze or change your life but it sure sounds pretty and trippy and and it keeps Plant off \\"The Mastodons Of Classic Rock\\" tour. Proof positive that the desire to create and forge ahead still burns.

B000001GPX|4.0|The 1975 Vienna-Kleiber 5th comes as a wake-up call from the points of reference of the chocolaty Berlin-von Karajan and dry Cleveland-Szell versions that ruled the 1960s.<br /><br />In absolute terms, however, I think \\"A Listener\\" got it right when s/he wrote in to this space back in 1999.  Beethoven's 5th Symphony is a single statement, never losing focus or deviating from its path.  The Vienna-Kleiber 5th misses this.<br /><br />Kleiber allows (or asks) for suave strings and woodwinds, even while calling for punishing brass (mainly horns).  Almost every transition from brass to strings or woodwinds loses tension as the strings and woodwinds smooth out their figures.  When the brass reappear, they're overkill by comparison.  The listener experiences a stop-and-go performance in which each moment is gorgeous but where the unique idea of the symphony is lost.<br /><br />And finally there is Kleiber's tempo in the 5th's last movement, which is quite reasonable: in other words, wrong.<br /><br />Now, the 7th: here is where the Vienna-Kleiber performance catches the insanity and keeps up with the heritage of the Berlin-von Karajan 7th from the 1960s and the Chicago-Reiner 5th from the 1950s.  Wonderful intensity, drive, tone, and precision.<br /><br />Kleiber threatens to get a bit reasonable again in the last movement, but manic strings and horns keep things on edge until Kleiber finally gives in to the music's ultimate loss of restraint.  It falls short of the madness and depth of the conclusion in the Berlin-von Karajan version, but I think I like it better overall for its superior transparency of sound.<br /><br />And remember that it's not, after all, an either-or situation.  When you want to get a little crazy and perhaps a bit closer to Beethoven, there's always the Reiner 5th and the last movement of the von Karajan 7th.

1416550550|5.0|Sometimes it is fun to have a book that just takes you away from it all. Kate Morton's \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" is that kind of book. It follows the lives of three women in different time periods - 1909, 1975 and 2005, who are related but unaware of the real connections. In 1909, a young girl named Eliza is brought to live with her wealthy uncle and aunt in rural England. In 1975, Nell travels to England from Australia searching for clues as to how/why she was abandoned on a ship traveling to Australia when she was only four years old. Thirty years later, her granddaughter, Cassandra, tries to puzzle out her deceased grandmother's history. She knows that Nell made the trip back to England, but she only has a journal about the trip to give insight into what she found. Something in the journal about a small, walled garden piques her curiousity and she too travels to England to find clues. There are elements of a mystery in this book, but it is mainly the story of the three women and their ability to cope. The descriptions of landscapes and gardens are gorgeous and the character development is superb. \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" is a delightful novel to escape into.
0811876373|5.0|Bakerella is amazing and her ideas are ultra-cute.  Personally, I find cake balls way too sweet for my taste (Bakerella herself describes them as \\"super-sweet\\" and I agree), but I love the book and it totally deserves 5 stars. I have already bought two as gifts as well as one for myself, and will be buying more as well as recommending it to all my friends, for the simple reason that it's full of brilliant ideas for decorating sweet truffles.  I have been making truffles by combining crushed Oreo cookies with cream cheese for almost 4 years now. The saltiness in the cream cheese cuts the sweetness of the cookies, so (in my opinion) they taste so much nicer than cake balls. Bakerella mentions the possibility of oreo truffles on page 98 of her book, and you'll find the recipe on her website as well as elsewhere (1 pack cream cheese, one pack oreos, one pack almond bark for coating - just 3 ingredients).  I use Bakerella's ideas but with an oreo truffle filling - perfection! I don't bother with sticks though, I just put the balls in paper cases - it's less hassle that way.  By the way, shop around for the best-priced white almond bark, as prices vary widely.  In Houston, the lowest-priced by far is the store where \\"here everything's better\\".  In the UK, almond bark is called \\"chocolate flavour cake covering\\", brands include Silver Spoon and Tesco.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|I have a short attention span when it comes to movies. So I can count on both hands the movies I could actually sit through twice, and Wall-E is one of them. Pixar is the ONLY movie studio that can take a rusted trash-compactor robot and a sophisticated probe, have them fall in love, send them off into outer space to confront a creepy autopilot, and pull it off so cleverly with so little dialogue. Definitely one of the gems of the animation world.
B000PFFSKM|5.0|This original recording is what I heard growing up.  I made the mistake of buying the remastered version a few years ago (because the store did not carry the original recording as issued in the US).  I was not at all impressed by the four bonus tracks, and they did nothing to make up for the removal of a great version of Teacher from the middle of the album.  Thus I was very pleased to be able to find this original recording version on Amazon.  It's a great rock album, probably my favorite by Jethro Tull, from a simpler era of the band.  The album showcases good songwriting and some beautiful musical moments.  Check out the guitar work on For Michael Collins, Jeffery and Me and Sossity; You're a Woman.
B0017VG69U|4.0|I bought this for my friend, who is a Huge fan of Star Trek.

I recommend this, if you're a fan, or if you're getting it for a fan. If not, why are you looking up Trek?  lol.
0553805371|2.0|Excellent state of the art review but any new ideas on it.  How could gravity be a consequence of matter and, at the same time, its cause? Aparently the negative gravitational energy is the best Hawking's guess for the creation of the univertion out of nothing. But spontaneous creation could explain HOW but not WHY the universe exists.
0131480057|5.0|Also not designed to teach you how to run Linux in your basement (but you can take everything they say and still apply yourself to that if you choose.) I was almost scared off when I read that in the preface, since I didn't have large systems to test on.  Fear not however, the book is a masterpiece and even non-pro users will find themselves discovering the power of Unix/Linux, and I mean the full power, they don't leave many stones unturned in this book.    However this book is targeted to larger system deployments and real world large systems.  Which is fantastic, everything to get Linux users to the 'next' level is here.  IT/IS professionals who have for the most part mastered basic *Nix commands will find this book extraordinary.  I have the e-book version of this, but I really needed to get the paper one too.  That is how good this is, and I have read just about everything in it at this point.    The book is well laid out, unlike my review it stays focused within each section.  So much content is in here I can't even pull out half of the parts I found useful so I won't even try.      If you're a Unix/Linux user (IT/IS pro), buy it.  If you're learning how to walk in Linux, you might want to stay away for a little bit, though it does do a reasonable job of refreshing the memory of most users, there is not THAT much introductory level information in this book to get you all the way up to speed.  If you're ambitious enough I guess a new user could make use of this book, but I would suggest reading other material before this.    Best Linux book I have purchased ever to date.

B0036EH3XE|4.0|A beautiful and non disappointing ending, unlike the end of seinfeld and the supranos where the ending just didnt live up to the show. This was a compelling ifinal season filled with a clever combination of  of tragedy, laughs, adventure, scary stuff, . I truly recommend not only this season but the series as a whole; it's one wild ride you won't forget. I have never been more hooked on and obsessed with a television series as I was with LOST. When the final season came along I was skeptical that it would be able to live up to the hype and provide a proper ending to the epic tale of science vs. faith, not to mention the classic ensemble of characters, that we've followed for six years. Now that the series is over I have to say that I am blown away; the finale in particular exceeded my expectations.

B000929AJQ|5.0|I own every NIN CD, every [HALO] and am mildly disturbed to have seen NIN fans going soft. I have been a fan of the one-man band for so long that, when \\"With Teeth\\" came out I was deliriously happy just to know he wasn't giving up or giving in. At what cost do you ask? If you, like I, have been there since the beginning... You will not be disappointed. I know there's a lot of talk out there and NO this isn't \\"The downward spiral\\" or \\"The Fragile\\" or even \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\"... but what it is, is a combination of the three. Its an incredibly well executed sound plethora. Would you want it to be a copy of something he has already created? Are you simply afraid of newness and change? Its a sample of the different sounds we know Reznor is capable of. Don't buy into the hype, buy it for yourself and be shocked that it is not terrible!(As everybody claims) You people out there parading as TRUE NIN fans, I'm saddened for you. How could you not see this as another one of his masterpieces? Reznor has an unearthly talent of painting with sound and creating the most beautiful music. To you who is wondering whether or not to buy... don't take my word or anyone else s for that matter. Just buy it and listen for yourself. However, I assure you, you could not be disappointed.

0446310786|5.0|TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a panoramic novel; it's about all the different kinds of people that inhabit the \\"Old South\\". The protagonist is Scout Finch, the motherless tomboy, daughter of a small-town lawyer. Their neighbors are all independently wealthy spinsters, except for a man named Radley, who lives with his mentally-ill brother Arthur (known as \\"Boo\\") who we never see. Then there are the \\"poor\\" people of the South; an honest dirt farmer named Cunnigham, and a notoriously filthy cracker named Ewell. Early in the story, Atticus Finch informs his daughter that the Cunninghams are poor, but repectable. The Ewells, however, have disgusting habits, and he warns her to stay away from them.    In some ways, To Kill a Mockngbird is a cautionary tale. Scout learns that friends, family, and neighbors can't always be trusted, and you can't \\"judge the book by the cover\\" when dealing with the people close to you. Take for instance the Cunninghams; the father may be \\"honest and respectable\\", yet he keeps his son out of school to work on the farm. Though Bill Cunningham believes in hard work, he doesn't believe in education, and his son will most likely end up illiterate. Another flaw of the Cunninghams is that they are easily swayed by conservative (and racist) whites who try to lynch a prisoner. Scout foils the lynching, but I won't reveal how.    If you're not American, but you want to understand who we are and how we got this way, then you need this book. If you're looking to become a US citizen, read this book. If you're studying American habits, this book will reveal everything.

A whole mess of books and comics came out for both franchises, even a series of books combining the two.  Aliens vs. Predator was AWESOME - in books.  When it came to Alien3 and AVP the movie... it seemed like the writers of the movies had all this great source material that the fans loved, but decided to ignore all of it for the sake of originality.    Good job.    The sequels were all original, and horrible.  Because all of the good stuff was already in the books, so by ignoring it all you had only one direction to go, make a bunch of crappy movies.  Congratulations, hollywood, this franchise is officially dead.

I was hoping for an album that took on the old school (per-say) Linkin Park music bland perceived in \\"Hybrid Theory\\" and \\"Meteora\\" and not necessarily Minutes To Midnight. But in all (sigh...) Linkin Park still rocks and I recommend spending your hard earned $15 on it:P

0385335997|5.0|I have completed reading the Outlander series, but I would put \\"Voyager\\" as one of the best of the 7.  Diana Gabaldon is an eloquent, articulate and fun author.  If you are already up to this book, don't stop now!  I am 52 years old, and these are the BEST books I have ever read.  They have been a source of joy and might I add, obsession.  I have read nearly 7000 pages from the first part of July until the first week of September...yes, books 1-7.  I cannot hardly wait (have I a choice?), for the 8th chapter in the lives of Jamie and Claire.  I am enchanted and captivated.  I love historical novels, and these have been EXCEPTIONAL. Diana Galbaldon has brought characters to life in a most real, pragmatic way, with humor and life lessons and golden moments (albeit sometimes tarnished) in history, from Scotland through the beginning of our wonderful country/American History.  If you like love stories, this is the finest, full of love, respect and sexual undertones.  But, isn't that real life?  Thank you Diana!

0439023513|2.0|Disturbing, violent, unpleasantly graphic, quite a letdown after Book I (best ever) and Book II (not bad).
0307474712|3.0|I actually enjoy both literature AND romantic comedy. However the combination brings back unpleasant memories of my youth when my Mom insisted on feeding me a dish that combined fish AND bananas.<br /><br />Some small spoilers here...<br /><br />The cleverly structured story of the relationship of Dex and Em, starting out as a drunken college hookup and growing from there was a fun read with some laugh out loud moments. It is most successful in the first half where the storytelling is lighter and sweetly nostalgic. The theme of their correspondence (she writes long hysterically funny works of art which he responds to with one word postcards) hit painfully close to home - I thought I was the only person to ever write wittily funny letters to a huge crush under the guise of friendly correspondence! But still there friendly flirtation felt very real and will strike a chord with most everybody who has ever had a friend who could have been more.<br /><br />However the book slowly goes off the rails with Dex's increasingly painful alcoholism and as he ages, the selfishness which seemed endearing and age-appropriate when he was younger turns into an overwhelming character flaw (like other readers the scene where he \\"cares\\" for his infant was horrifyingly difficult to forgive). So much so that Em's continued interest in Dex starts to feel rather sad. Similarly the author is very busy telling (but not really showing) us how amazing Em is but her own lonely solitary life filled with poor romantic choices seem to indicate otherwise. When they finally do get together, it seems the author is trying to make a case for soul mates who simply needed to wait until the \\"right time\\" but the effect seems more of two desperate people who have run out of viable alternatives. The ending, one could argue, represents \\"real life.\\" But to me felt like somebody who had the makings of a painfully funny romantic comedy but then decided they wanted to be taken seriously as a \\"real writer\\" and thus took things unnecessarily into a dark direction.<br /><br />That being said, there are some really good parts of this book which leave me giving it 3.5 stars. The author has a gift for dialogue and humor. He also has an eye for relationships and all of the dynamics between various characters rung true and familiar. I laughed out loud at multiple parts (in the first half) and definitely felt invested in these two people and wanted to see where their journey would take them. Despite my disappointments, I will keep an eye on David Nicholls and am curious to see which direction (lit vs. rom com) he pursues next (fingers crossed its the latter).rily into a dark direction.

B003NWS5AO|5.0|Back in the day when rock music meant just about everything to me, there were two categories of bands I listened to:  (1)  Led Zeppelin and (2) Everyone else.  There were some great bands and artists in category No. 2, but they weren't Led Zeppelin.  And that was the point as far as I was concerned:  Led Zeppelin was (and remains) in a class all by itself.  With the twin frontmen Robert Plant (vocals) and Jimmy Page (all things guitar), this was (and is) a band for the ages.  And not just because of \\"Stairway to Heaven.\\"  There were other great cuts as well.  My personal favorites are \\"When the Levee Breaks,\\" \\"Kashmir,\\" and (especially) \\"Ten Years Gone,\\" the greatest of the great.<br />Zep was instantly recognizable because of Plant's amazing voice: clear as water, with an amazing range and that little hitch in the voice (think Roy Orbison) that could tug at your heartstrings.  The first five Zep albums changed the rock music world--irrevocably.<br />After John Bonham's untimely death, Zep broke up and the remaining three artists, Plant, Page, and multi-instrumentalist John Paul Jones went their separate ways.  Page and Plant recorded together ([[ASIN:B000024FP2 No Quarter]]), and with other artists as well.  Page even recorded a testosterone feast with rock god wannabe David Coverdale [[ASIN:B000000OT1 Coverdale & Page]].  Page and Plant also put together a Zep reunion tour a few years back.<br />But it must be galling to be remembered for the songs one wrote and sang some 40 years ago, and Plant has clearly moved on.  The aforementioned \\"No Quarter\\" CD singled a change in direction for Page and Plant--instead of crashing guitars, a lot of acoustic music that drew its power not from sheer volume alone, but also from the inherent emotion in the music itself.<br />Perhaps \\"No Quarter\\" presages Plant's current offering, \\"Band of Joy.\\"  Recorded in Nashville, it immediately evokes Plant's folk music roots.  The music is a combination of gospel, old country & western from the 1950s (think Patsy Cline or Eddy Arnold), bluegrass, folk, 1960s-era garage bands, grunge, and that particular blend of New Orleans Cajun music.  There aren't any of the exotic instruments of \\"No Quarter\\" here, nor are there any keyboards that I could hear, just mandolins, banjos, acoustic guitars, what sounds like a washtub bass, pedal and lots of what sounds like Fender Telecasters played through a Twin Reverb amp with lots of fuzz tones.  Soaring over all of this is the remarkable voice of Robert Plant, clear as cool water, at times crying, whispering, or even shouting here and there. At times he sings alone, at times harmonizing with the lovely voice of Patty Griffin, at times accompanied with singers that sound for all the world like the Dixie Hummingbirds.<br />Plant's voice is still there in all its glory: immediately recognizable, it shows no traces of the years (there's a photo of him on the inside liner of the CD case.  He looks like all of us do who were teens in the 1960s and perhaps haven't aged too gracefully).  But that wonderful voice, the voice that to me defined rock and roll for nearly 20 years--It's still there!  Thanks be to whatever musical gods there are for preserving this treasure.<br />I must admit that I was initially taken aback by this CD when I stuck it in the car's CD player while tooling down the road.  I'd expected something like [[ASIN:B000002JQP Fate of Nations]] or even [[ASIN:B000024FP2 No Quarter]].  The gumbo that my ears sampled was initially too rich.  But repeated listenings have made me fall in love with this wonderful CD.  There is not a weak cut here, and there are some beautiful ones, just right for cuddling up with somebody you love:  \\"Falling in Love Again\\" and \\"The Only Sound That Matters\\" are wonderful close dancing, huggin' and kissin' songs; Plant's take on the old folksong \\"Cindy I'll Marry You Someday\\" is perfect.  \\"You Can't Buy My Love\\" evokes memories of the Beatles and their hit \\"Can't Buy Me Love.\\"  The ominous gospel sound of \\"Satan, Your Kingdom Must Come Down\\" is just right.  And then there's the intimacy of \\"Silver Rider;\\" it sounds like it was recorded as were the Enya CDs of years past, with the mic right up next to the mouth, so that even the tiniest mouth sound makes it into the recorded mix.<br />None of this is what I expected--boy am I glad.  What a fabulous CD.  Anyone who loved (or still loves) Led Zeppelin, and who's curious about the roots of Robert Plant, their amazing singer, will enjoy this CD.  To my ears, it's an instant classic.  I only wish it had another 12 cuts; I could listen to it for hours.  Come to think of it, I have!  Buy it now!of \\"Satan, Your Kingdom Must Come Down\\" is just right.

B0001Z37HM|2.0|It's bad but not as as bad as Arlond's other films. The fight scences are pretty solid & the settings are stylish. The best actor is the kid who played the prince. Some scences & quotes look and sound like a porno like \\"Only women may touch it\\" and \\"She wants you for herself\\". It also has plotholes like \\"Why did'nt the Wizard kill Red Sonja when she was near him?\\" The worst part of the movie is the robot sea monster. Where did they make that thing? Radioshack? I give this film a 3 out of 10.

B003WKOLQO|5.0|It is with immense relief that I can say after listening to the new Volbeat album for the second time...it actually EXCEEDED my expectations and emerges as possibly their best album so far! It's really exciting when the newest album from a band is this good because it makes you wonder if they've even reached their peak yet. 'Mirror and the Reaper' is a great opener and immediately sets the tone for the astonishing tour through musical bliss you are undertaking. Ripping right along you will witness track after track of sheer energetic / melodic mastery, including  the unforgettable 'Fallen', the ripping thrasher '7 Shots' and the melodic / haunting \\"Evelyn\\" with its occasional shocking and awesome death metal vocal bursts. 'Being 1' is an ultra-melodic romp that sounds like a hit single ready for radio play, while 'Heaven Nor Hell' features some of the meanest harmonica playing you'll ever hear before breaking into a 50s style groove fest complete with razor edge guitars and rockabilly lust in overdrive! While many bands tend to put their best songs toward the beginning of their albums Volbeat ends this modern classic album with possibly their best song yet - 'Thanks' is my favorite track on the album (a barroom anthem if ever there was one) because it's the one that's been playing over and over in my mind the most.    Volbeat's uncanny ability to clearly pay homage to their influences without sounding like a shameless rip-off of those influences is simply amazing. It is a VERY fine line to walk and this band does it with a rare combination of confidence, grace and honor. While some sections of their songs continue to sound like newly discovered tracks from Metallica and Slayer when they were at their peak (that's certainly not a bad thing as far as I'm concerned), and the rousing catchy 'Misfit' style vocal melodies are still on full display, Volbeat continues to craft an overall unique style that is almost impossible to describe. In this album they have managed toinclude even more of the best influences of rock 'n roll, rockabilly, punk & metal (including brilliant nods to such diverse influences as The Ramones, Social Distortion, Johnny Cash, and Mercyful Fate) without sounding disjointed in any way. Every song flows with a melodic mastery and raw energy that is a rare treat to behold.    I can wholeheartedly say that there isn't a single weak track on the entire album. Not since \\"Dark At Dawn\\"s self-titled album (back in 2006) have I been able to say that about a band. 'Beyond Hell / Above Heaven\\" is truly an incredible musical gem which proves that Volbeat is a consistent, rapidly rising force in modern music. If future albums are of this calibre (or better, if that's possible) the band will certainly achieve legendary status.    All fans of solid, powerful, energetic, melodic, ripping, catchy, confident music should have this album in their collection.

B000001ELP|5.0|just heard this album for the first time since i had on vinyl when i was 10 years old. needless to say my musical tastes have vastly changed in the 30 years or so since then.i listen to everything from black sabbath to pink floyd,miles davis,rush,slayer....you name it and yes i still love kiss.the old kiss anyway(with makeup).i cant say this is my favorite kiss album but it is a great album.a total departure from anything they had ever done but it still sounds like kiss.nearly every song is good and a couple are great(the oath).if this album had been released byanother band like rush or pink floyd or someone like that known for concept albums it would have gotten much better reviews.give it a chance, put it in and listen to it for what it is.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I keep thinking of reading Eye of the World in the early 1990s and wondering how long before the next book (and next and next etc.).  I will have to get used to this again.  Sanderson has me hooked already and its book one of an expected ten year series.  Even with how fast he writes, I don't expect this to be concluded until 2020 at the earliest - which is a long time to wait for a conclusion.    That being said, I'm anticipating because I enjoyed the book so much.  At first I felt the scenes with Shallan and Dalinar were slow but they sped up and were definitely strong characters.  The scenes with Kaladin I enjoyed from the start.    Sanderson was very vivid in describing the scenes, especially within the Shattered Planes.  I clearly pictured it within my mind's eye while reading it.    I just want to know more and read more.  It will be a very long ten years (or more) as I anticipate each volume of the book.
0061714372|5.0|Dave presents this read with the humility and humbleness of a truly honest person. I always felt that he had the chops to be a truly great musician, and he is. He was there, along with Hetfield et. all, that created thrash. That is why he deserves the respect. Dave has lead a truly remarkable life. This book is a fun read. Very humerous in places. In other places, I felt tears in my eyes as he describes some situations that has had a profound effect on who he is as a person. I love the fact that it feels like you are having a conversation with a friend as he describes the truth behind much that has taken place during his tenure as one of the best metal bands on the planet. This read reveals that he is a human, just like the rest of us, and humans make mistakes from time to time...and shows what is truly important in this life. Highly recommended.

0143118420|5.0|.....engaging. Very refreshing....as refreshing as non-fiction can be.  Well articulated.  The   forthrightness of the Author's feelings made this book readable to the end.  Although I am have not yet experienced this wonderful thing we call marraige, I know how it feels to be unfufilled despite the things that surround you.  I find it bold of author Elizabeth Gilbert to explore and find fufillment for the one person you should live your life for at some point in your life....you.  (Most of us experience this before marriage and a baby) Let this be a lesson to all of you who have found a million reasons to stay, all the while dying inside as a stranger stares back at you from the mirror,  when only one is needed to leave.  Men do it all the time. Love Yourself!    Lisa Eve, Author  \\"Unforgiven\\" and \\"Innate Sacrifices\\" (coming soon)
B003MWHVLY|2.0|I've waited awhile to post this review, since I have been a fan for years and this album immediately hit me as wrong when I purchased it as a pre order. Way too pop..  I thought Sia was \\"above\\" this, but I hesitated and let it sit for a bit and then would listen again... Same conclusion.  Not trying to be a hater as I can appreciate musicians trying different stuff and pushing new boundaries, but this is just going into a more pop oriented direction and is not my cup of tea.  I look forward to Sia's next!

B0032JTV6U|4.0|I love this show. if it was only based on the quality of the show i would give it a 5. the docking is due to the extra features. none of it is new. i've seen it before. i was kind of disappointed to be honest. but if you don't really follow the show online (only watched it on TV) then you most likely haven't seen the extra features. I watched my episodes on hulu and [...] so i've come across the clips or at least links to the clips before. other than that, i would totally recommend this show.
0810988933|5.0|Title: DIARY OF A WIMPY KID<br />Author:  Jeff Kinney<br /><br />That's right, I said DIARY OF A WIMPY KID. Why? Because it's one of the most memorable books I've read this month. People everywhere are talking about the \\"cheese touch\\" so I had to see the movie and read the book to understand this cootious phenomenon. What I learned is that middle school is just as tough now as when I was a kid, if not worse.<br /><br />Lucky for me, I have a reader in the house who has collected them all, so I only had to sneak into the bedroom of an elementary school-aged child to get a hold of this hot series. It's all about poor Greg Heffley who has to start middle school after not growing any all summer like some of the other kids who are already sprouting...(GASP!)...hair. His older brother, Roderick, warns him to keep his head down, but Greg is determined to be popular enough to make the yearbook. As life usually does, things don't go according to plan, and thanks to his cruel older brother and best friend, Rowley (who would rather be himself than be cool), middle school does not go so well.<br /><br />Sketched illustrations gave the story a comic book edge, and Greg's sarcastic observations about his sneaky successes and dismal failures kept me in stitches. I haven't read a book this fun since I picked up the first HARRY POTTER novel so many years ago. It's a totally different genre, but like POTTER, it touches something universal--though not in a \\"cheese touch\\" kind of way. With or without little nippers, I recommend this series to anyone who wants to laugh until something squirts out their nose.<br /><br />--The Privateer Newsletter<br />[...]

B003SWNRU2|5.0|Think of the greatest Accept album you ever heard...Metal Heart, Breaker, Restless, Balls, etc......then you know what you're going to get out of \\"Blood of the Nations\\". On a scale of 1-10, this is an 11. No kidding. One of the best metal albums I've heard in YEARS. What German guitar is all about. Makes you want to sell your house, trailer, barn, etc. to get enough money to buy a 1959 V just like Wolf's. Yes they're really that good, and \\"Blood of the Nations\\" proves it. Takes all these kiddie metal bands to school and whips them behind the woodshed. You want killer riffs, soaring neo-classic leads, drums from the one who INVENTED the double bass roll, and vocals that remind you of the glory days of Metal Church and Accept, (with a twist of something new from Mark), look no further. If you like REAL metal, just buy it..game over, insert coin...

B003Y5H4SY|4.0|\\"Devil\\" is the best film M. Night Shyamalan didn't direct. I think I now understand why I haven't liked any of his movies - he lets himself get in the way of his own good ideas (exempting \\"The Last Airbender,\\" which wasn't his idea at all). By giving the filmmaking responsibilities to others, his ideas can remain intact, but at the same time, they can also be approached from a different, less self-constraining angle. They might even be improved. For \\"Devil,\\" Shyamalan is credited as the story creator and as one of the producers. The screenwriter is Brian Nelson, recently known for penning the vampire thriller \\"30 Days of Night\\" and the indie shocker \\"Hard Candy,\\" the latter of which scared the living hell out of me. The director is John Erick Dowdle, who underwhelmed me with \\"Quarantine\\" and is still intriguing me with his as yet unreleased film \\"The Poughkeepsie Tapes,\\" delayed since 2007.    While by no means a great supernatural thriller (as so few are), \\"Devil\\" is surprisingly effective - taut, suspenseful, and brisk, with decent performances and intriguing dialogue to boot. On the one hand, it's a claustrophobic horror story about things that happen in the dark, and if there's anything we've learned from the good horror movies, it's that your mind can conceive of things far scarier than what a director reveals on camera. On the other hand, it's a chilling character study, a peek into the souls of people. Many of them are bad. Others have simply made mistakes and lurking underneath is the capacity for change, which covers everything from facing your demons to forgiving those who have wronged you. It all boils down to a simple decision: You either pay for your sins, or you ignore them. You can probably guess which of the choices is easier. You also probably know that what's easy isn't necessarily what's right.    The film is founded on the premise of a Devil's Meeting, in which Satan takes on human form and tests evildoers by tormenting them. And so it comes to pass in a Philadelphia high rise that five people enter an elevator, only for the car to stop mysteriously stop in mid ascent; what begins as an inconvenience quickly gives way to suspicion, paranoia, and the occasional loss of light, at which point awful sounds are heard. When the lights come back on ... well, I don't think I should say what we see, for it would ruin the apprehension. Let's just say that on board are a mattress salesman (Geoffrey Arend), a temp security guard (Bokeem Woodbine), a young woman (Bojana Novakovic), an old woman (Jenny O'Hara), and an ex-soldier turned mechanic (Logan Marshall-Green). In one way or another, all have done things that have hurt other people. And as the ads have repeatedly told us, one of them isn't who he or she seems.    They all have clashing personality quirks. The salesman is insensitive and never knows when to keep his mouth shut. The guard is uncomfortable in tight spaces. The young woman overreacts. The old woman worries about everything. The mechanic has a short fuse and is always guarded, which is a good indicator of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Who amongst them seems a likely candidate for the Antichrist? Take your pick - they're all equally capable of bad deeds.    Keeping tabs on them via surveillance camera is Detective Bowden (Chris Messina), who was drawn into the situation when investigating an apparent suicide at the same site. Bowden is a recovering alcoholic and still trying to cope with a recent tragedy. He doesn't believe in anything greater than himself, and he certainly doesn't believe in the Devil; it's a matter of reasoning, of processing the information as he finds it. At his side is the film's narrator, a security guard named Ramirez (Jacob Vargos). He's devoutly religious. He completely believes in the Devil, who he's convinced is responsible for the terror unfolding in the elevator. How else to explain the distorted face that appears in a single frame of the elevator's surveillance footage?How else to explain the warning signs his mother dictated to him as a child? How else to explain why every attempt to fix the cable system or penetrate the shaft walls have all failed?    If Bowden is a man of no faith, and if he's in a situation that has no logical explanation, one must deduce that he's eventually forced to believe in something higher than himself. I should emphasize that I'm not necessarily referring to God. Saying that you believe in something higher than yourself could mean any number of things, and of that, I will say no more. Regardless, Bowden is being tested, just as the people in the elevator are. I leave it to you to discover who passes and who fails. \\"Devil\\" is certainly not groundbreaking, but it's a perfectly competent horror film - technically sound, nicely performed, frightening, and above all, engaging. In my review of \\"The Last Airbender,\\" I admitted that my nature was to resist the films of M. Night Shyamalan; on the basis of this film, I think he would be wise to let other directors interpret his work from now on. If Dowdle could do it, imagine what someone else could do.
B0017JKEL8|5.0|Mad Men is by far one of the best shows on television today, although I will admit it's not geared towards all audiences. With stellar performances, amazing writing, and what feels like a spot on representation of the time, Mad Men reveals the behind the scenes turmoil of the kind of people who helped shape America into a modern country, for both good and bad. This is definitely a drama, so don't expect explosions or large fight scenes, but you'll get some of most emotionally packed scenes you'll find in the history of the medium.

B002AFX52S|5.0|Fantastic and, overwhelmingly, a Brilliant movie, if you can handle the English subtitles. This is an excellent addition to your dvd collection.  Pretty close to historical fact, for what documents they still have from the Japanese 16th century. This (The Criterion Collection) remake version is stunningly beautiful - regular dvd looks blu-ray quality. The theme of this story works between illusion and reality that Salvador Dali would have been proud of.  The Japanese culture and civilization come across well and true to form with even the wardrobe, antics etc. all being intact.  Intense acting and in-depth facial expressions and gestures make this movie monumental.  The dedication and honor aspects of the story are vital to the direction and sad conclusion of this epic drama. Note: There also is this E.A. Poe influence and \\"dada\\" expressionistic imagery overshadowing the movie, mostly towards the end.     You need to read more on the story on Wikipedia.  Here is part of the story on Naitô Masatoyo of the Takeda Clan. \\"He had opposed the attack at Nagashino and, in the course of the battle, was shot many times by arrows before being beheaded by Asahina Yasukatsu. He had been noted for his warm disposition and his equally impressive talents in warfare and administration. He had even been a mentor to the young Katsuyori, Takeda Shingen's fourth son. At Nagashino, after disagreeing with Katsuyori, he rushed into battle, dying an honorable death.

I had a feeling when I read the description a few weeks before release that this could be something special or somthing really terrible. Sorry guys its the latter.
044654759X|4.0|Nicholas Sparks novels will never win the nobel prize, will never be acclaimed by the New York Times but I can count on reading a story--usually in a small North Carolina town, that is full of home town folk--people that one could probably meet if I were to go there-- and I am almost always captivated his books!  Safe Harbor is no different.  The book tells the story of Katie (formerly Aaron) who is fleeing from a violent past.  Without telling too much, she finds her emotional home in this story and I found myself concerned for her and could not stop reading the pages.  Is the novel perfect? No.  However, if you are interested in reading a book about people that you can relate to (no super spies, etc.)and want to root for, want to cry over alittle, want a little(or a lot!)of sappiness but still like it, this one is for you.
143350393X|5.0|This is a great bible.  The comments give the popular view points for scripture, but unlike other study bible I've had gives support for the one the commentators find most plausible. I may not always agree, but the extra discussion is very helpful. The color maps in text are much more convenient than flipping to the back.    The only reason I didn't 5 star this is that apparently there is a recurring printing problem of a section of 10 to 15 pages that are slightly blurry. Mine has it in Acts. I can still read it though. On second thought I'm not sure I should ever 4 star the Word of God...
B0030U1TLQ|5.0|This expanded, remastered reissue of the Cure's penultimate release will not fail to impress long-time fans of the band or to hook new fans who are finding their way into UK Indie/Britpop/Goth/Shoegaze/Alt genres.  As stated in the liner notes, \\"this music has been mixed to be played loud, so turn it up\\" and the sentiment holds true now better than ever.  Also included is a full length live performance known as \\"Entreat.\\"  This \\"Entreat\\" reissue, unlike it's predecessor, is complete and sequentially identical to the studio album.  Outstanding.  Packaging is filled with the usual mix of photos, rare and previously unreleased songs, demo tracks and b-sides, and anecdotal bits and pieces concerning the process which led to \\"Disintegration.\\"  The collector will appreciate the packaging, the devout will appreciate the pre-studio home demo versions of songs which eventually evolved into some of the Cure's highest-charting singles.  This album was already extraordinary, something of a top-three or top-five \\"music you want with you if you were stranded on a remote island\\" albums.  The reissue elevates \\"Disintegration\\" to a higher plane of sonic enchantment.  Music evokes memories of events and people and seasons from the past, like a listening-post for events long past, some good, some bad, all now obscured by time and accomplishments.  Every track has the potential to be this kind of portable time-machine.  What may be considered one of the Cure's defining, pinnacle creative endeavors, \\"Disintegration\\" is yet more than that; this album helped to define a musical genre (or three), and stands out as Fine Art among the work of the Cure's contemporaries.  With the release of this reissue, a great album has been awarded an equally great reissue, fulfilling the notion that \\"Disintegration\\" is one of those rare, high-water-mark masterpieces that every band wants to achieve.  Stay tuned, though.  The rain isn't done pouring just yet.

1439181780|4.0|The Secret helped me come along in a difficult moment of my life. The Power gives me renewed strength, belief, faith, hope and energy... It is difficult, I think, to follow it, but the book contains a message which I am trying to work on in order to make my life the constant joy, which it is supposed to be. It is hard, I think. But I work on it. And I am grateful to have been led to both The Secret and The Power...

Seeing history through the eyes of a confused child, we are able to view events with a fresh perspective. This is one of those books that will have you thinking long after you finish reading.<br /><br />If you read nothing else this year, read this.
020530902X|5.0|this book had one dent on the cover and that was the only damage! excellent condition!!
B003S897UK|5.0|Thankfully this one finally sees the light of day. The show starts off with some Mule classics and then at the stroke of midnight they turn into the world's greatest cover band with \\"21st\\" Century Schizoid Man and a Who and Zep cover. Then on CD 2 blues legend Little Milton appears for 6 blues tracks followed by Audley Freed of the Black Crowes for some more rock and roll. Things finish up on CD 3 with a laid back southified 3 song encore ending with a stirring version of Skynards \\"Simple Man\\". All great stuff and a bargain price too. What else could you want!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|No worries, this knife is great I have not been disappointed to date with this knife, however the sheath that comes along with is not so good. Nothing about is satisfactory, al it does is flop all around. Likely you will have to consider a alternative if you want a sheath.
B001EYU1VO|4.0|This is an excellent stick, the base feels a bit flimsy but has never been a problem even with my wild driving actions in TrackMania United (car racing game). I have never had a centering problem like I had with 2 previous sticks (1 older saitek & 1 other brand). It has a stiff centering spring that takes a little getting accustomed to but it actually helps to snap the vehicle back to straight ahead immediately. It is very adjustable to fit most user's hands and preferences, both physcal adjustments & software.  I have owned this stick for 8 months and the only problem I have had until today was that the X/Y pivot gets a little rough acting. A small amount of silicone lube gets it back in action.    Unfortunately it died today!!! Windows will no longer recognize it. I will be contacting Saitek for warranty replacement. Also I have ordered another identical stick.
0810983915|5.0|These are the words of my nine year old son.  This book should be a 5 star book.  It's fun to read and an awesome book.  He and his brother love the series.
0811876373|5.0|Just got back from Borders with the new Cake Pops book in my bag.  What a treat!  Angie Dudley, the creator of [...] has hit a home run with this book - there are more than 40 edible projects.  There are recipes, decorating ideas, tips for making the pops, tips for using food other than cake to make the pops, and lots of detailed photos and how-tos. The photos will be a huge help to me.    The book is like the old spiral-bound composition books we used to use in high school, except that the cover is hard...but I love the pink color of the metal spiral (pink is my signature color).  The spiral does allow the book to lie flat, which is very helpful when you are trying to read and have baking utensils in your hands (or hands covered with batter).  Be careful closing the book - the pages can tear if the spiral doesn't allow the book to close on the first try.    Buy this book as soon as possible & start having fun!    P.S.  Get the book from Amazon for $11.97 with free shipping.  I paid $19.95 at Borders.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|After watching these episodes on Broadcast Television for years, I was amazed to learn how many episodes had been produced; I thought there were more.  If you know and enjoy Fawlty Towers, already, get this for your mate. S/he will love you all the more; an episode before sleep is better than a cigarette, and who know?  Some episodes might make you stay up longer.    This is rudeness as we might wish we could employ it ... sometimes.

B000005J56|4.0|This isn't my usual style of music but I saw it dirt cheap and I've always thought that it was a good thing to randomly just buy something that catches your eye (or ear in this case) just to experiment and also something to flush out your normal musical diet. And this CD really served that purpose for me. I must admit that I know nothing about Latin American music or Cuban stuff in particular, and slide guitar has never held much appeal for me. But the good time vibes here, the sparse and natural feeling production and the sheer style of the rhythms has seen this disc get some serious rotation on my stereo over the last year or so.<br /><br />The open arrangements as opposed to the stuff I normally listen to has been a great boon and certainly it has proven popular whenever I have had people over. The simplicity of much of what is going on causes a certain reflective mood to settle on the listener and your disposition after listening to this is certainly sunnier than when you started, which when all the hyperbole is stripped away is a valid enough reason for music to exist. Though there is some sorrow in them there hills too, a few of the ballads really encapsulating some human foibles.<br /><br />Given the cheap price this thing floats around for, if you are after some mellow rhythm driven music that is openly structured and upbeat without being manic this just may make your Sunday afternoon.
B000QGEB12|5.0|i could watch this movie over and over stephen chow really did a great job with it i love the style of this movie it the only one like it ive ever seen this is definitly a buy and must see
0143038419|1.0|OH PLEASE!   I really wanted to read this book.  I really wanted to  like this book.  I read it. I certainly did not like it.  OK, Gilbert fully admits that she was paid to go on this 'journey' of spiritualism, and to write about it.  And I bought into it as she ate her full in Italy.  (Glad she admitted that she gained weight)  OK, she went to India and prayed- at an exclusive Ashram.  well....  maybe I still buy it, but not so much.  But REALLY,  while in Indonesia she meets her gorgeous latin lover??!?  Come ON!  What are the odds?    If it were fiction, it would be trite.

B002QGUFWE|5.0|Warning:  This is not an original thought, but Lady GaGa is a POP GENIUS.  There really isn't any debate about it.  Everyone keeps saying she's the next Madonna or whatever, but I believe she will one day be as big as Michael Jackson.  We are witnessing the mere tip of the iceberg known as The Lady Gaga Phenomenon.  Mark my words...    THE FAME MONSTER:    1.  BAD ROMANCE - despite all of her major hits, this one is her signature song.  It is her \\"Billie Jean.\\"  2.  ALEJANDRO - Her ode to ABBA and Ace of Base (yes!!).  Fun \\"silly\\" song but I recommend \\"The Remix\\" version.  3.  MONSTER - Best use of electronic tom toms since \\"Good Times Roll\\" by The Cars in 1978.  4.  SPEECHLESS - proof that she has a little (maybe a lot) of Elton John in her.  It will be interesting to see if this is her new direction for the next album.  5.  DANCE IN THE DARK - Probably the most 80s sounding song, which is a total plus.  References to Madonna (Vogue) and Bruce Springsteen (yes!!)...who else can do that???  6.  TELEPHONE - O.M.G.  Probably THE MOST CATCHY POP SONG EVER WRITTEN.  I actually bought this album based solely on the 30 second snippet of this song.  GENIUS.  Gaga adds playful kiss-off lyrics, gimmicky vocal enhancements, hooks galore, bizarre background vox, KILLER BEATZ, Beyonce!, a clap machine, telephone rings, and an automated operator message all into a perfect pop song package.  TWO WORDS:  POP GENIUS.  7.  SO HAPPY I COULD DIE - this song perfectly sums up how Gaga's music makes me feel.  Floating on a cloud, so happy I could die.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|The AmazonBasics backpack is a great option for those looking to carry 2 DSLR bodies and 2-3 lenses.  The dividers are movable, as they are held in place by velcro.  This allows quite a bit of flexibility.  There are plenty of small pockets inside and outside the backpack.  They are useful for storing batteries, Compact Flash Cards, etc.  Another feature are the clips on the side to hold a small tripod or monopod.      It's very lightweight yet sturdy.  One suggestion for change would be to change the handles on the zippers.  I prefer an open handle on the zipper to allow for attaching the two zippers on the main pocket together with a carabiner to prevent the zippers from separating and opening up the main compartment accidentally leading to falling hardware.      I used this bag with one DSLR body and 3 lenses on a trip to Yosemite.  It was very rugged and performed it's purpose well.  Nothing happened to the camera nor the lenses.  It doesn't advertise itself as a camera bag, either, which may reduce the likelihood of theft.    For the money, you can't beat it's versatility and light-weight.  I was thoroughly impressed.
073935275X|5.0|It was a stroke of genius to buy this trilogy on CD for a cross country trip from Boston to LA with my daughter to take her car to college.  I had read the books and she had commented she wanted to read them, so I bought this set for the ride.  The stories are wonderful and gripping and we had it on for most of the trip.  I think it probably was the single most important factor in keeping us from even one major fight on the trip. It kept us wide awake behind the wheel, filled the void of silence that a mother feels necessary to fill with conversation  when spending hours with her daughter and made for interesting discussions. I highly recommend the books in any form!
1597801577|4.0|Paolo Bacigalupi's The Windup Girl is an extraordinary achievement, a first novel that won both the Hugo and Nebula awards for best novel and richly deserved both wins.  It's set in a richly detailed and highly dystopic future, our world but about a hundred years from now, so strongly rooted in our present that its plausibility is disturbingly all too believable.  In addition, its set in a fascinating locale - Southeast Asia, and most specifically Thailand - that you almost never see in science fiction. As someone who's spent time in that part of the world, I can tell that Bacigalupi really did his research, bringing a wealth of detail from the varied cultures, religions and politics one finds there and extending them into a future in ways that anyone familiar with the region can trace the roots back to our present.<br /><br />The world of The Windup Girl is a bleak future we can envision all too easily from our world today. The age of oil has passed, as has the original global economy built on it. A new global economy is slowly emerging from the chaos that followed the collapse of the previous one, but trade is now conducted by sailing ships and dirigibles. Global warming has caused the oceans to rise across the world, leaving Bangkok a city besieged by the sea, with enormous sea walls and pumping stations working around the clock to keep the waters at bay. It is a world driven by the struggles to survive, most particularly against out of control man-made diseases that threaten not only people and livestock but more importantly the agricultural foodstuffs on which they depend, and governments and corporations everywhere are locked in a constant battle to stay one step ahead of these constantly mutating pathogens. And a country's sovereignty is largely dependent on its ability to withstand the aggressive mega-agrobusinesses who dominate the world through their control of disease-resistance seed stock that must be constantly replenished by the companies as the resulting crops are themselves sterile (just think of Monsanto and the things they're already doing).<br /><br />In addition to the detailed world Bacigalupi presents, there are five very human characters whose stories are told as they get caught up in the events of The Windup Girl, and the novel threads itself back and forth through their various points of view:<br /><br />Anderson Lake, a man who arrives in Bangkok to take over operations at a local kink-spring factory but who in reality is an undercover \\"calorie man\\", an agent for AgriGen, one of the global mega-agrobusinesses that now dominate the world stage.<br /><br />Hock Seng, Lake's right-hand man at the factory, an elderly Chinese \\"yellow-card\\" refugee, one of tens of thousands who fled to Thailand after his family and business were wiped out by fundamentalist Malays in Malaysia in a bloody wave of racial massacres. He struggles to survive but still dreams of rebuilding his family and his fortune.<br /><br />Captain Jaidee, the idealistic and passionate \\"Tiger of Bangkok\\", an incorruptible and too-daring-for-his-own-good inspector of the Environment Ministry, fighting against not only the constant biological threats to Thailand's survival but also the rampant corruption that undermines the country itself.<br /><br />Kanya, Jaidee's number two, a woman caught up by both the political machinations that pit ministry against ministry and by her own personal conflicts that tear at her more and more as the political and environmental situations deteriorate.<br /><br />And last but far from least, Emiko, the \\"windup girl\\" of the title, an artificially created person, a product of Japanese bio-engineering genius, struggling to survive after having been discarded by her former owner in a land she wasn't designed for and in a culture that despises her very existence.  A creation designed and trained to serve without any thought of self but whose struggle to survive is forcing her to evolve beyond what her creators intended.<br /><br />All of these characters are ones the reader comes to care about, all with their all too human strengths and weaknesses, their acts of selfish self-interest leavened now and then by acts of redeeming grace.<br /><br />In his world-building, Bacigalupi does interesting things like examining the impact of scientific creation on cultural beliefs, like how Buddhism might have a problem with artificially-created life forms, viewing them as not only soulless but also an obstacle to reincarnation, their growing numbers by consequence limiting the opportunities for souls in limbo to reincarnate, causing an overflow in the number of ghosts in the world.<br /><br />He also fills in his genetics-gone-amok world with a lot of fascinating creations, one of my absolute favorites being the 'cheshires':<br /><br />\\"The cheshires are here,\\" Mr. Lake comments.<br />--Hock Seng looks to where the yang guizi indicates. At the periphery of the bloodletting, shimmering feline shapes have appeared; twists of shadow and light summoned by the carrion scent. The yang guizi makes a face of distaste, but Hock Seng has a measure of respect for the devil cats. They are clever, thriving in places where they are despised. Almost supernatural in their tenacity. Sometimes it seems that they smell blood before it is even spilled. As if they can peer a little way into the future and know precisely where their next meal will appear. The feline shimmers stealth toward the sticky pools of blood. A butcher kicks one away, but there are too many to really fight, and his attack is desultory.<br />--Mr. Lake takes another pull of whiskey. \\"We'll never get them out.\\"<br />--\\"There are children who will hunt them,\\" Hock Seng says. \\"A bounty is not expensive.\\"<br />--The yang guizi makes a face of dismissal. \\"We have bounties back in the Midwest, too.\\"<br />--Our children are more motivated than yours.<br />--But Hock Seng doesn't contest the foreigner's words. He'll put out the bounty, regardless. If the cats are allowed to stay, the workers will start rumors that Phii Oun the cheshire trickster spirit has caused the calamity. The devil cats flicker closer. Calico and ginger, black as night, all of them fading in and out of view as their bodies take on the colors of their surroundings. They shade red as they dip into the blood pool.<br />--Hock Seng has heard that cheshires were supposedly created by a calorie executive -- some PurCal or AgriGen man, most likely -- for a daughter's birthday. A party favor for when the little princess turned as old as Lewis Carroll's Alice.<br />--The child guests took their new pets home where they mated with natural felines, and within twenty years, the devil cats were on every continent and Felis domesticus was gone from the face of the world, replaced by a genetic string that bred true ninety-eight percent of the time. The Green Headbands of Malaya hated Chinese people and cheshires equally, but as far as Hock Seng knows, the devil cats still thrive there.\\"<br /><br />My only real problem, and it's not an insignificant one, is that Bacigalupi plunges the reader into his world from page one and then lets it flow full force, never explaining some of the references being made that seem to be critical to understanding exactly what has happened that has made the world what it is. One frequently feels like there was a previous novel one should have read that might have helped understand the world better, rather like attending a lecture and getting the feeling that there most have been a pre-requisite lecture one didn't know about. For example, references to \\"calorie men\\" are constantly being made but even though I've read the entire novel, I still cannot say exactly what that means, other than the fact that they work for these global mega-agribusinesses and that having people find out what they are means risking being arrested by angry governments or being killed by even angrier mobs.<br /><br />But that said, The Windup Girlis one of those novels that one must read, not only for the pure experience of it but because it is one of those novels that become a classic standard, the mark against which subsequent novels in that vein will be judged, like Miller's A Canticle For Leibowitz.

B002JH3TW8|5.0|I had replaced my MacBook with a MacBook Pro . . .  Didn't realize that I wouldn't be able to plug in my old LaCie Firewire 400 Hard Drive and Dazzle analog video input box . . .   Bought one of these adapters.  Everything works as before.  Perfect!
B002ZG99N6|5.0|I've wanted to see The Town ever since I saw the first previews of it. First, the story seemed quite intriguing: what happens if a man falls in love with the woman he anonymously took hostage while robbing a bank? Another thing that made me want to see this film is that, unlike many crime dramas, this one seemed to escape the artificially polished Hollywood-ish feel. I had to see it.     ...And I was correct on all counts! The Town, which was co-written, directed, and features by Ben Affleck, was every bit of what I thought it would be. The directing was very \\"real\\" feeling (especially capturing the working-class feel of Charlestown, MA very well). The script was quite good, not once seeming over-the-top or under-developed. The cast and acting was very good.     But I reserve a separate paragraph for talking about the plot and its execution. This film is somewhere between a crime thriller, a character study, and a romance. It has enough teeth to excite those who like car chases and heists but enough depth of emotion to satisfy those who want strong characters and plot lines. The story revolves around Doug McRay, who robs banks with his friends from Charlestown. On one heist (the movie opener), they deviate from the plan and take a hostage. After letting her go (she never saw them), Doug decides to follow her and talk with her. They end up starting a relationship. The questions: how can Doug keep this secret, and how can he get out of his life of crime?     The plot's execution was very well done: fast enough, slow enough. By the end, you have really identified with Doug McRay and may end up feeling as conflicted as he.     For its great story line, believable direction, and its originality, I give The Town 5 stars and recommend it highly to you.
1878424505|2.0|The actual four principles of the book are solid, good principles. But they are entertwined with a lot of new-agey fluff that was not worth my time (not that it's a long book). If you pick up on the four principles from the reviews, you've gotten it.
B003N7GATM|1.0|Dont get me wrong! I'm an avid NIN fan and have been since the inception all the way through the Slip... i have enjoyed the change and Trent Reznors growth as a musician.. the problem with this album is that it is too much Mariqueen Mandigg and not enough fusion of the 3 Artists as a band (Atticus Rose, Reznor, and Mrs. Reznor.)  The only song i enjoyed was the Spaces in Between.. but i believe its because they made a video with it and the video, being low budget, was very well done. I really cant see where the direction is with this band.. it doesnt feel industrial, it doesnt feel experimental, it doesnt feel anything.. thats the issue it has lack of emotion, real emotion. i've read the lyrics with the songs over and over.. they are very teenage-y... to me they dont evoke anything meaningful.. when i hear her sing them i just feel bored and uninterested... they dont give me any chills or since of relation to the moment. they dont feel like they have any of Trent's input or even oversight... it feels like this band is Mariqueen and then Reznor and Rose as backup guys, and unfortunately it just doesnt work that way. Fur Lined is the most god awful track on that album.. i get her concept a bit, i actually kind of like her style and creativity even tho she comes off like an airhead sometimes (twitter) but that doesnt really matter, the facts are this doesnt sound cohesive as a \\"band\\" album.. its like Mariqueen and others... thats what i would of called the Band. no offense. and its a really unfortunate waste of a great band name! How to Destroy Angels... well... i think all of the Angels were destroyed by all this garbage. I personally feel Mandigg is not suitable for a Lead vocalist... She is not experienced enough in range and scale to do this. Her voice feels very muted and almost manipulated.. I have listed to her sing for WIG and even tho i dug the music, i see why she was always a vocal backup singer and not a lead... now she could easily get away with singing back up vocals.. i just dont know what lead Atticus and Trent to think they had something with her Voice... theres nothing substantial.. nothing raw, nothing beautiful or interesting about her voice.. and i hate to say that but its true. shes a beautiful girl but she needs some voice and range lessons! I will most likely never buy another HTDA album.. i will listen to it or pirate one of the songs but thats about it... To me its not even worth the HD space! save your money or go buy an old NIN album u dont have!ck up vocals.. i just dont know what lead Atticus and Trent to think they had something with her Voice... theres nothing substantial.. nothing raw, nothing beautiful or interesting about her voice.. and i hate to say that but its true. shes a beautiful girl but she needs some voice and range lessons!

B000NDIAWY|4.0|This is her best work.  The first four songs are all home runs.  Turpentine is a piece of pop art, My Song is as aggressive as anything she has done.  There's a bit of filler later on in the album, but This is definitely my favourite of hers.
030726999X|4.0|This book is  the one that answers a lot of questions from the first 2 books.  Sets the stage for more adventure, but sadly this maybe the last.

B003PIUC02|5.0|After watching the first episode,I was hooked.  Great story line with twists and surprises everywhere  (who saw that happening in the end of season 1)!   Can't wait for season two.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|A fantastic period piece. The plot is captivating, costumes beautiful and soundtrack wonderful. The extra features on the DVD are well-done also.
0802473156|5.0|This is a book that I wish I would've never been in a position to come across, let alone read.  However, I am thankful that I took the time and opportunity to do so wishing I would've been exposed and receptive to its message long before now.  It has helped me to process communication in a totally different light.  The references to couples the author worked with in the past really helped to explain each of the love languages.  Also his way of referring objectively to either sex really made it easy to be able to see both sides points of view.  This was helpful when elaborating on a specific language or explaining how to put it to use in day to day life.  I was recommended to read this book and very thankful that I did.  If you want to improve your ability to communicate to a loved one this is a must read.
B002QKZLZ6|3.0|If you are not one of the people who go everywhere wearing your bluetooth headset, then you will sooner or later have to either leave it at home or put it in a pocket or a similar place where it'll be susceptible to damage.    For the price this little magnetically-closed case will suit some uses.     I do see a couple of design aspects that make it a bit less than ideal for me: the clip will work on fairly narrow belts. Up to 1\\" will be OK and beyond that, the clip will be permanently open at the bottom of the clip, and that flare at the base of the clip will be digging into you and the case is more likely to brush off the belt and perhaps be lost, caught in a closing car door, or run over.    The second thing I see coming down the road in a few months is the construction of the leather which covers the metal clip underneath: the inner and outer leather is held together with stitching and eventually the threads will wear through and the covers will come apart. This is unfortunately a standard manufacturing technique on belt-type cases like this. So -1 star for both these things.    Why in the world the designers left one end of the case open may become clear as I use it; but the initial impression is, uh, why? The left side is open to the outside from about 1/2 way up; a simple \\"U\\" shape cutout in the front would be all you'd need to be able to hook the Voyager and bring it out.    The case itself appears to be sturdy enough for normal use, is pleasantly padded and will blend easily into business attire. it is not hard-use tactical duty gear. For that I'm thinking perhaps a handcuff case?     BTW the Amazon seller did a great job of fast shipping for a reasonable price.    UPDATE 9/26/2010    Well, I wish I could say it's been working out, but after 8 days of use, it is apparent that an unforseen problem has cropped up.     If you are active or have a bulky shirt or sweater pushing on the case, the magnet closure will be forced out of alignment and you may find theflap hanging open and pushed askew.    To put it another way, for belt use the ideal owner will be someone in an office setting, wearing a dress shirt and is a person of slim build wearing a narrow dress belt.    I added some strips of velcro to mine, so now it stays shut when bumped or moved by clothing. This causes the profile to be a little deeper than before but at least it stays shut now.  -Minus another star for this.
B00275EHJG|5.0|My kids and I saw it 3 times in the theater and cannot wait til the DVD is released!!!!
B000MU4EGY|5.0|I didn't really use this to listen to.. I know, shame on me! I bought it because my sister LOVES the beatles and since she is a music lover I made her a clock for christmas using this record. I slightly sanded the hole in the record just to make it a tiny bit bigger so I could fit the clock piece in the center. I did not put any numbers or any decoration on it either because I didn't want it to ruin the clock and then I took the cover for her record and framed it. She LOVED it!
B001PKHS68|5.0|Any one who is a Cary Grant Fan, will love this movie. With Grace Kelly, who is also super actress, you will enjoy this wonderful movie.  It is a classic. Also a fan of older movies, this is how movies were made.  It left the sexual feelings up to each person. They did not have to show EVERYTHING!  If you love Alfred Hitchcock, you will LOVE this movie!
0385528752|5.0|This is the best book I have read on change in ages!  The Heath brothers share a process that embodies our rational brain and our emotional brain.  By understanding how messages travel to our decision making center, we learn why change (personal or organizational) can be so difficult.  This is not all....<br /><br />The Heaths provide the reader with some exercises so that we can diagnose what is happening and craft a path forward.  They then explain what was done to 'solve' the problem.<br /><br />The book is clear, filled with stories and insights, and fun to read. Complex mechanisms are translated into simple metaphors that make the learning sticky. Their writing style is conversational.  Most importantly, it left me with a plethora of ideas that I can practice as I make changes and help others navigate through our changing work environment.<br /><br />If you are interested in how change happens and how it sometimes derails, read this juicy book.  It is part of my permanent collection and I refer to it frequently.
B002PNAY9C|5.0|This book was fantastic! My friend got me hooked on the series and I have emjoyed them all. Some reveiwers stated that it was tedious reading.  In some places, that may be the case.  Paolini is, however, a master story teller, creating a thoroughly enjoyable experience.
B003SWNRU2|5.0|I have every Accept album ever made, and although Mark's vocals are different than Udo's, he brings the same level of grit back to the band that Udo brought.  In much the same way that Sammy Haggar brought a different style to Van Halen, Mark brings a different style of 'grit' to Accept.  Let's face it, nobody can replace UDO, we have come to expect every album to sound like 'Fast as a Shark', with the vocals sounding as if they were eminating from a larynx that had a chainsaw taken to it, those days are gone for Accept.  If you want to hear UDO, then go buy U.D.O. albums.  I do.    Mark's vocals are a blended mixture of Marc Storace(Krokus) & Biff Byford(Saxon), and they are a good fit in this version of Accept, but he's not gonna sound like UDO.  He's going to sound like Mark, and that sounds great!!    It's a terrific album from start to finish!
B00004R997|3.0|Saludos Amigos is forty-two minutes long and was released in theaters on August 24, 1942. Saludos Amigos is the first of six package films put out by Disney Studios and it is the shortest film to date put out by Disney Studios to date. A package film is a film were the script are too short or not long enough for a full length featured film and are packaged together to form a single theme. Saludos Amigos is part documentary and part film shorts. The four film shorts are: Lake Titicaca, Pedro, El Gaucho Goofy, and Aquarela do Brasil or Watercolor of Brazil. Donald Duck is featured in Lake Titicaca and Aquarela do Brasil. Also we are introduced to the first time to the character called José Carioca. José Carioca is a South American parrot. Saludos Amigos was the first of two goodwill South America films; the other is The Three Caballeros which came out two years later. In my opinion Saludos Amigos did not live up to Disney past films. Saludos Amigos gets a C in my book.

0439023513|5.0|I received my copy quickly and thought it was great that I could pre-order it!
0802473156|5.0|This book approaches relationships in a different way.  It talks about how to make the other person happy by learning their \\"love language\\" so you can show love in a way that is more meaningful to him.  The author also does a great job of noting that you won't get immediate results but someone has to be the first to swallow her pride in order to create a more loving atmosphere in the relationship.  After showing your partner that you are making the effort to make him happier and feel more loved, eventually he will return the favor.  If he never does, then maybe it is time to move on.    I think people, or at least I used to, expect a 50:50 give-and-take all the time.  And they believe that if the relationship isn't always equal, it will never be.  This book is a testament to how relationships require work to reach that level of 50:50.    Someone prior had mentioned that there should be a 6th love language of space and I completely agree.  I believe not understanding that space was my ex-boyfriend's love language was a reason (amongst the fact that I had other personal turmoil) this book didn't work out for me.  I didn't speak in his love language and so didn't truly follow the recommendation of making him feel loved by respecting his love language.      While that relationship ended, I now know how to approach my future relationships.  I didn't grow up with a good model for a giving and loving relationship.  My parents constantly fought, were abusive to each other, and didn't make efforts to show each other how they love each other.  This book is helping to change my perspective on creating a healthy, loving relationship.    I felt that some parts were redundant but that didn't take away that much from the value of the book.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|I love the new series, but I was getting seriously bored with the year o' specials between the \\"death\\" of Donna and the introduction of the new doctor.  Some of the specials were outright terrible, with boring, preachy story lines and lame characters.  Besides, they'd essentially killed off Donna, who was by far my favorite companion.  With the exception of the last special (Tennant's farewell episode/movie was beautifully written and movingly depicted) I seriously thought I'd have to give up the Who habit...thank God that series five was tightly written, consistently conceived, and perfectly executed from start to finish.  It brought my Who joy back into my life.  At first Matt Smith seems a bit young, but he brings an electricity and energy to the Doctor that was lacking in Tennant's increasingly world-weary performance.  And, much as I love Tennant (and I do), Smith's a better actor.  Besides, Amy Pond, the new companion is sexy, snappy, and fun, bringing all the best elements of the former companions together into one package.  Series Five kept me watching (and often laughing) and I can't wait for Six.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Wow!  I received this box set as a Christmas present and LOVE it.  So much so that I bought it as a present for another Beatles fan.  The replica LPs, record covers and inserts are a wonderful touch.  Hope this limited edition is still available for Beatles fans! Oh and Amazon has it on sale for about $50+ less than it retails at least when it first came out in 2009.
B000008COG|3.0|AC/DC trudged along through the mid to late `80's amidst the hair metal onslaught and the rise of thrash with middling success. Their albums from this era show some wear and tear of the often times glorious limitations of their sound. `Blow Up Your Video' is JAA/DCR (Just Another AC/DC Record) which still makes it as good as or better than most of what stood for hard rock/metal in this overly corporate and trendy rock marketplace.  No better or worse than their previous record, `Fly on the Wall'; `Blow Up Your Video' seemed to benefit tremendously sales wise from the astounding (and fluky) success of the compilation/soundtrack `Who Made Who' released between the two albums. The momentum of that album definitely contributed to `BUYV''s sales because quality wise; there wasn't much difference between `Blow' and `Fly'. `Blow''s biggest assets are songs one and two; \\"Heatseeker\\" (also lead single) and \\"That's the Way I Wanna Rock n'Roll\\" which became to latter day AC/DC minor classics. The rest of the record has decent to fair songs including \\"Go Zone\\", \\"Some Sin for Nuthin'\\" and \\"Rough Stuff\\". This LP notably marked the return of the Vanda/Young production team that had helped forge the early AC/DC sound of the `70's before the mega commercial touch of Mutt Lange. It supposedly also marked the last time Brian Johnson would receive lyrical credit on an AC/DC LP (not that he's the best wordsmith to begin with, so no loss here).  AC/DC fans will enjoy `Blow' but they already accept it for what it is, a minor work (when you put out 15 plus records!) from a legendary artist. Tell bossman where to go....brain control..
B002C6K7NU|5.0|I found this album to be surprisingly good. Usually, when old bands from the 70's and 80's put out new albums, they leave you flat bcause the bands are running out of musical ideas.  That is certainly not the case here.  It's not the same as the original Skynyrd sound from the 70's.  This is really indistinguishable from contemporary country music, but I mean that in a positive way.  The songs are catchy, memorable, and the lyrics have real meaning. Really, this is my favorite Skynyrd album, and that's saying something, given Skynyrd's excellent track record.
B003S897UK|5.0|This would have been a fantastic show to be at. The guest artist's are all great, sound's like they all enjoyed themselves. Warren's Simple Man is absolutley brilliant. He can really sing. I play this album on a regular basis. Great Stuff.
B0031YJFCQ|2.0|I enjoyed the first book, the second one was ok and I then I had to get this one to finish the story.  Boy, did it finish the story.  I never want to hear anything more about these characters.  This book fell off a cliff killed me dead.  What a boring story and such an anticlimatic end that when I put it down I couldn't stand any charachter that had given life to the first two books.<br /><br />If you are reading this you've already finished book 2 and will have to ready this one and for that I am sorry.
B003NX6ZDC|3.0|All of the good songs but crossover are on the deluxe. So get that one. The first half of the album is pretty slow. Thats about it.
B003V5PPZG|1.0|As Churchill once said, \\"there is nothing wrong with change, if it is in the right direction\\".     Did the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Queen, Eagles, etc. change with time? Yes they did. But did they change in a direction opposite to the desire of the grand majority of their fans? Did they change in such drastic fashion as to make the number of disappointed old fans far exceed the number of satisfied new ones? Did their change sound imposed upon their listeners rather than demanded?     Linkin Park needs to understand that with Hybrid Theory and Meteora they accomplished what all bands try to accomplish but only a very select few succeed at: they created a signature sound and style that enchanted millions around the world. Now they should focus on further refining their unique style instead of throwing away the source of all their success and basically starting from scratch. Accomplishing what they did with Hybrid Theory and Meteora was audacious. But flushing all these accomplishments down the drain and expecting to achieve the same success with a totally new sound that most of the fans seem to dislike is pure presumptuousness.     My main problem with A Thousand Suns is that it sounds like the band second-guessed itself. It comes of as recognition (by Linkin Park itself) that their original style wasn't good enough. This recognition also comes as a slap to the face of the fans that are left with a totally unrecognizable and quickly forgettable album. To some it might seem like a bold move, but to me it seems more like killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.
0061537969|5.0|I haven't read it. It was recommended by my sister, whose loves dogs, for our Mom. Mom, who is 87 and living alone, really enjoyed it.
B000683VI4|5.0|I enjoyed this movie.  Great love story.  I recieved it in good condition and in a timely manner.  I would recommend this if you like love stories/chick flicks.  It is entertaining.
B004132I20|5.0|With the Guy Ritchie film series moving forward on the next fun filled installment and this fantastic show coming out with a new season next fall, it's never been a better time to be a Sherlock Holmes fan.<br /><br />As many others have said, I was also dubious when I heard this show would be a modern retelling of the classic characters created by Arthur Conan Doyale in the late 19th century.  But after the first five minutes I was hooked.  The show is smart, tense, well written with an obvious regard/respect for the source material, and has tremendous production values.  I've seen every episode and can't wait to watch this on BD when it comes out in November.  The transition from the foggy streets of late Victorian London to present day is as smooth as it can be.  Don't be fooled!  Get this show!<br /><br />Entertaining from start to finish, Sherlock is a top-notch program from BBC that I believe will get better and better as time goes on.  I hope they realize what they have and keep it going for a long time.  Holmes and Watson are played by brilliant actors who understand the iconic characters they are playing but also are skilled enough to give their portrayels a different slant we haven't seen before.  I hope to watch them grow in the role for many years.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|I adore the Gilmore Girls and the service here at Amazon did not disappoint me.  I recieved the Gilmore Girls DVD set in a timely manner and in good condition.

B002WYH5N2|5.0|I don't know how many times one of my daughters and I have seen this movie! We really enjoy it. Yes the romance, chivalry, the costumes, the customs, etc are really enjoyed!   If you're in to romance, this is the movie to get!
B002ZG98VE|2.0|ROBIN HOOD had promise.  Russell Crowe as the titular anti-hero (here, an archer named Robin Longstride); Cate Blanchett as Maid Marion (Marion Loxley); Mark Strong as the insidious villain (no longer the Sheriff of Nottingham, reduced here to a minor character); and supporting roles from heavyweights William Hurt, Max von Sydow, and Danny Houston.  Throw in Ridley Scott directing, and Brian Helgeland (MYSTIC RIVER) penning the script, and you've got the key ingredients for a movie masterpiece, right?<br /><br />Right.  Except it never congeals.  First of all, the film isn't at all realistic; an ordinary archer manages to impersonate a knight?  Also, and this is the worst fault: the script is unbelievably shallow.  So shallow, in fact, that I can't help but wonder if this is Helgeland's script at all, or if the studio didn't do some trimming to make this a bit more streamlined.  Crowe and Blanchett are reliably strong, but their characters are two-dimensional; Strong, a fantastic villain actor, has absolutely nothing to do but walk around glaring.  Only Oscar Issac as Prince John, and Danny Houston as King Richard, have any meat to sink their fangs into; and neither actor is in the film very much.<br /><br />Scott and Crowe were clearly aiming for GLADIATOR territory, unabashedly so.  Instead, they should've focused on crafting a unique, original film.  The climax is a let-down, the pacing is off; the cinematography is beautiful, and the premise is good, but ROBIN HOOD is, unfortunately, not the film we've been waiting for.  But, hey, if nothing else, at least Robin doesn't have a mullet.

0439023483|5.0|The author really has a way with her words. The book came recommended to me from a friend in our book club and while I was hesitant because I heard it had some disturbing parts I decided to try it. I could not put it down once I started. I think it will make a great choice for book clubs and bring alot of nice discussion and feelings to the table.  With it being geared for the young adult I think some parents may seem it a bit brutal and distrubing. However, what are country is facing in real life these days is much more than this. Take the time to read and if you have a young adult child it may make for a great conversation and a great time well spent with them.
0470449748|5.0|This is essential to GMAT prep.  The practice questions are the main reason for this.  I'd recommend other sources for Gmat test taking strategies and insider tips.  However, once you're ready to just practice those methods covered by Kaplan and such, this is what you need.  The practice questions are organized by difficulty so you can do some of each level and move around depending on the type of practice you need most.  What makes this a standout is that it is compiled for the GMAT Council- so it has real past questions and is developed by the creators of the test.  So this is a great source once you've learned about the test structure and methods and once you just need practice.

He actually takes you through the jungles of the Amazon and you feel as if you are actually there in the boat with the men. Both my husband and I had trouble tearing ourselves away from what the next pages had to say ! His best writing to date ! We were most pleased with this purchase from Amazon.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|This is the greatest collection of Beatle's msic around. This made a great birthday gift for my little brother, who is a GREAT and longtime Beatle fan.
0060005696|5.0|The first time I heard about \\"The Paradox of Choice\\" was while watching Michael Moore's documentary \\"Bowling for Columbine.\\" Fans of Michael Moore would know that documentary was made several years ago. Over the years, despite my best efforts to read the book, I failed. It's not a judgement on the quality of the book, but that the book was competing for my attention with other publications namely the works of Philip Roth, Graham Greene and articles in The Times, The Washingtonpost, The Journal, The New Yorker and National Affairs magazine. Now, after finally having read the book, I can say \\"The Paradox of Choice\\" was a revelation. Its premise is that having too many choices makes for an unsatisfactory life; the more choices the less satisfaction. The book introduces two categories of people maximizers and satisficers. Maximizers look for and accept only the best in whatever they buy and are willing to spend hours comparing all the available choices. But satisficers are happy with good enough. For example, to buy a pair of jeans satisficers may visit a few stores then make their selection. Mr. Schwartz tells us about \\"sunk costs\\" meaning accessories or clothing we don't wear, but don't throw out either because it would mean a loss. He asks when making a decision whether it's better to buy stock in a company and lose money or stay put and see the stock gain value. He tells us why many of us are risk averse and constantly compare ourselves to others. Other interesting topics relate to regretting over decisions and dissatisfaction that \\"what ifs\\" cause. Skillfully, he enlightens the reader about benefits of tempering the impulse to get the best deal in a market flooded with options. He tells us in a competition why coming second feels worse than coming fourth or tenth and why failing an exam by a single point is more disappointing than failing it by a dozen points. Lastly, he explores the relationship between being a maximizer and depression and having fewer choices andhappiness. The last chapter offers suggestions to people facing difficulty coping with ubiquitous choices. One of the simple suggestions he offers is being humble about what one lacks, grateful for the things that are going right and warns against ruing missed opportunities. Curiously, the older we get the more likely we're to be satisficers. It would be apt to sum up this book as low expectations and availability of fewer choices make a happy life.

So I found this one..... and it didnt disappoint. I recommended watching this one if you've never seen a Miyazaki film. The musical scores alone for his films warrant a watch.

The only thing I didn't like was that it came without a case so I will have to buy a blank one as I don't keep cases around and I like to have the info that cases provide. I would probably buy from this seller again.
B003NWS5AO|5.0|I never was a great fan of Raising Sands. It had a few good songs but over all it wasnt an album I ever really wanted to go back to for some reason. This one however is very addictive, deeper and rawer. Plant seems to be enjoying this album more.    Its a keeper for sure.
B002ZTIIXK|3.0|It's ok, but too many songs that are alike, and that I haven't heard before. Rather have a smaller collection of songs I like best.
B003V5PQ1E|5.0|This album is beyond amazing. I love each and every track! I think Linkin Park has grown in a positive way, and I love every album they come out with. Everything they do makes me love them that more. They never stop growing, and they keep pushing themselves. I would recommend to everyone to preview the tracks before you buy it. This album has so many bad reviews for whatever reason, but honestly no one is forcing you to buy it! Linkin Park even had the album streaming for free on Myspace Music before the album was released. Check it out first, and if you truly enjoyed it like I did, go ahead and buy it! I honestly can not wait until the  next album, they amaze me every time with what they do.
B003VANOFY|1.0|First let me say that yeah quality of the headphoens themselves seems to be really good, sounds great, not better than my Grados but let not get to picky those are ridiculous. and whats all this about plastic joints??? i think you should put down your joint...     now after having these for three weeks here is what i found.     disclamer: I do love my Logitech products, I have a g15 (the big one, its still best) a G5, a s510, TWO mk520's, a joystick, 7.1 speakers, and thats just whats ON my desk... but, the effin G930 I just purchased is a horrible piece of crap... why did they even bother... I am so pissed i wasted $170 on these stupid things I cannot even begin to explain it.     The drivers for these are worthless, if you plan on buying it, at least pop over to their support forums and search for the g930, seriously, these haven't been out that long but see all the complaints, surround doesn't work most of the time, the mic is all messed up, the driver leaks in ram and swamps it causing  MASSIVE LAG!!! no go ahead really check out their forums, I can wait... come back when your done, form your own opinion from real users experiences, when your done come back and finish reading mine if you are still thinking about purchasing them.     Okay I assume your back and you are still thinking about buying them, how about this: I mean as a gamer, good sound is important, but NOTHING compared to lag. I actually have 3 other sets of headphones that cost more than $100 and provide excellent quality and no lag, wired ones, guess the tech isn't perfected yet. for that matter I have some head phones (with a mic) I picked up in the Philippines for about two dollars US and they don't cause lag...     They should be a great product, and are for listening to iTunes, but I have never lagged out of iTunes, or media player, or VLC; but games, they cause SO much lag... really how can these be a G series product? They ruin your game. Before them I was limited by the length of cable on myedymonics, now I have to reboot every 10 minutes or battlefield 2 lags horribly every 30 seconds... Hmm let me think, Lag and have wireless freedom or pwon and take off headphones before getting up... tough choice....    and let me tell you its not my computer, it worked before, and it will work after.     But seriously, is my computer not fast enough for these? let me give you some specs... I know its not the fastest thing but give it a break its old.  Core 2 Quad Yorkfield 3ghz  8GB of 1333 ram  boot drive is 2 150GB Velociraptors in a Raid 0  install drive is 3 1TB Spinpoint F3 drives in a Raid 5  video supplied by XFX Radeon 5870 driving 1 Samsung 26\\" display with  2 Samsung  24\\" displays on either side, Eyefinity 5760x1200    yeah I know i7 is out but i didn't see that on the req list for this headset, doubt it would make a difference.     For music and movies its a great product... if you play twitch games, don't even think about it.     Don't know what else to say...
B002VECM6S|3.0|I wanted to love- love- love- this film. Certainly, Sandra Bullock's performance was a plus--but unfortunately, the sheer flaws in the logic of the story ruined it for me.     What am I talking about?     Here it is: What happened to the black man, the uncle or relation who takes the two boys--including our hero--to the private school at the beginning of the film?    They vanish--including younger brother. Yet this was a definitive moment in the film.     So throughout my viewing, the thought pestered me: what happened to the person who brought the boy and his brother to the school in the first place? That question is just left out of the equation altogether and we next see the lovable gentle-giant-teen walking in the rain with nowhere to go: enter the Sandra Bullock character and her maternal gestures.     I was left thinking--why couldn't they just kill off(dies in an accident or something) the older father-figure black man (and younger brother)or something so I can forget how the boy got to the school in the first place?    But that question is completely forgotten about and therefore, my intelligence was insulted.    We are now, apparently, in fantasy-land where the kid is just wandering around on the campus of this privileged all-white school.    The other flaw was the bit about the teen not knowing anything about football--yet again, at the outset, we have the black father figure insinuating to the principal that the kid can do anything with a ball.    It's this ridiculousness that made this movie flat-line for me.    The rest is just sentimental nonsense. Although I liked the characters very much. It did not make up for these serious flaws in the narrative.

B001KVZ6G6|3.0|Me hubiera gustado mucho darle las 5 estrellas porque la calidad de la película en video y audio es mucho más de lo que me imaginaba. Siendo mi primer BD, quise experimentar las maravillas que hablan del BD Live. Lo decepcionante  fue ver un mensaje diciendo que BD Live solo está disponible en Canada y USA al intentar hacer la conexión. Igualmente me pasó al querer utilizar la copia digital, ni siquiera pude disfrutar eso, no me deja conectar porque no vivo en \\"Canada o USA\\". Yo vivo en Guatemala, Centroamérica.

1582701709|4.0|Believe it or not (ooh I think that phrase needs a copyright symbol?), it has taken me FOUR years to get around to write this review.  Maybe from some kind of subconscious spin, parts of mine inner self purposefully delayed the review until I had the chance to reflect four years later and \\"check\\" if the ideas behind The Secret actually worked.  Well, since I gave the book four stars, take a guess as to the outcome.      Foe me, it's not a debate of whether \\"The Secret\\" works, but rather it is the discovery that the simple ideas and philosophies that anyone can learn within (and by watching the video) are indeed real, and they do work to improve one's life.      First, I'll quickly run through the goofiness that I didn't care for in the book, and then the rest of my review will turn positive.  I didn't care for the fact that money was treated as something that should be \\"attracted.\\"  I wasn't too impressed by the prolonged discussions on wishing for objects and feeling like you already have them.  This is a bit silly.  I was also less than impressed with a general lack of empirical evidence to support this Law of Attraction, which indeed is a law but NOT a scientific law.     Those were my only major gripes with the presentation of \\"The Secret.\\"  But now to turn the tables, I praise what Rhonda Byrne has done.  She has taken the most difficult complexities of life, especially those areas that seem impossible to understand, and simplified them in a fun and thought-provoking way.  Perhaps she may have over-simplified the idea that like begets like (the Law of Attraction), and she was certainly not the first thinker that engaged us in the ol' power of attraction.  But one thing is certain: Whether Byrne gets credit for it or not, this kind of thought process is POWERFUL.    Just for kicks, after I finished reading the book, I watched the video too.  I will always fondly remember that huge ball of elephant dung in that dude's living room, for some reason. Because I was intrigued by everything I collected so far, I researched this type of New Thought for a long time.  After months of refinement, I formed my own unique approach to the Law of Attraction, and the big and general analogy between Aladdin's Genie and the universe itself.    IT WORKED.  I applied a fun and effortless pattern of positive thinking, about projecting a positive attitude, and about focusing on everything good.  Another big theme of mine was constant gratitude.  I made sure I was grateful for everything, including just to be alive (I should have died in my car accident 20 yrs ago, but was uninjured).     I placed an order with the universe to stick me into a job at a technology startup, and it happened.  I placed an extra order to get us acquired by a larger company so I could grow in that manner.  We got acquired by Intuit.  For a while, it felt unreal.  The more things that worked out in my favor, the more strongly this poofy puffy Law of Attraction was doing its job.     Then two years later, I got laid off. WTF, universe? Where's that genie, I'll kick his bubble-butt...     I was pissed. I did not order this. I also tripped and fell on the sidewalk later that day, got accosted by two homeless people that evening, and in a totally unrelated event, my damned tooth mysteriously broke and fell out!  Maybe the universe finally ran out of good \\"stuff\\" for me and was now universally out-of-stock?     Within two days, I realized what had happened. No, the universe's clearinghouse didn't shut down.  It was me! I had asked for all of this, and I got it. Here's how:  Over the last year preceding my layoff, I became strongly socialist in my economic and political views.  I also became extremely anti-corporate, which meant that I was pro-individual.  Ta-daa, so in effect, I ordered a detachment from that damn corporation and didn't even know it, and I got what I ordered.  That was good!      But remember that I was pissed off on the day I was laid off.  I thought \\"WTF else will go wrong today?\\"  Well, the ol' universe heard that too and rushed to fulfill the order. I think it did a same-day delivery, because I tripped and fell, lost a tooth, and later got accosted by slobbering thugs who came from the instant-delivery catalog of the universe itself.  That original stream of my own piss-off made a 360-degree arc and sprayed me right in the face.   :O       Once I realized that the layoff was a GOOD thing, I erased all of the other bad junk that happened to me that same day, which was simple and effortles.  I switched to thinking very positive again, which was easy since I had already been doing it every day for the past few years.  I haven't looked back since, because there has been no need.      Life. Is. GRAND.  :)      So you see, it is not necessary to take every word in the book literally, and this book shouldn't develop a \\"following.\\"  There shouldn't be people walking around and saying \\"Oh hai, have you applied The Secret today?\\"  If someone came up to me and asked that, I would laugh in their face, saying \\"You fool! You let the secret out!! NOOOOO! It's not much of a secret anymore, is it!\\"    Rather, you should accept the interesting concepts in this book as stepping stones, beyond which you will naturally open up more possibilities for yourself.  Let the book inspire you to go out and do your own research on positive thinking, and the law of attraction.  Do this, and trust me, your life will truly change in exactly the ways that Byrne and the other experts swear upon.
0439023513|5.0|Suzanne Collins' Mockingjay is the riveting final book of the Hunger Games trilogy.  To say that this book is absorbing seems like a massive understatement.  I carried this book around with me all day yesterday and simply could not tear my eyes off the pages.  The Hunger Games was intense, Catching Fire was gripping, but Mockingjay felt like being caught in a heartrending emotional firestorm!  The characters are brilliantly drawn, the scope of the action is broader, and the horrors of war take center stage in a remarkably vivid way.  If you enjoyed the first two books in this series or if you have any interest in dystopian novels, books about war, or stories with courageous heroines, Mockingjay should definitely be on your must-read list!<br /><br />What I Liked:<br />-  Katniss is still reluctant to see her public image used to promote other people's agendas, but even as she is being manipulated and used, she manages to blaze her own path and make her own decisions.  She is still a practical survivor at her core, but she is also a young girl who is tormented by nightmares, wracked by guilt, and plagued by grief.  Her insecurities, fears, and sense of guilt are more apparent than ever, but I love that she consistently leads her life with an impressive amount of compassion and courage, even when bombarded by one harrowing challenge after another.<br />-  I expected Mockingjay to have a lot to say about freedom, justice, and personal and political responsibility, but I was surprised and emotionally captivated by this book's incisive portrayal of the horrors of war.  Absolutely haunting!  Suzanne Collins does not glorify or sugarcoat the bloody atrocities of war.<br />-  The potent effect of media on society and the idea that the people who control the media, control the populace are used more effectively than ever in Mockingjay.  In the previous two books, we saw the Capitol controlling every broadcast across all of Panem.  This time we get to see two opposing sides airing their own propaganda messages, and the effect is powerful.<br />-  Seeing compassion highlighted as one of Katniss' greatest strengths is one of my favorite themes within this series.  In Mockingjay, Katniss gains a much broader view of the whole of Panem, so we get to see her compassionate impulses put into action across a war-torn country.<br />-  The characters in this series learn, adapt, struggle, and sometimes crack under the stress and trauma of their situations.  A few of the experiences they encounter do irreparable damage, and every bit of that is achingly painful to endure (as it should be).  This series has never shied away from showing characters pushed to their limits (and beyond), and Mockingjay takes that to a whole new level.<br />-  Not only does Katniss learn more about the world in this book, but her understanding of herself and of her own power also grow by leaps and bounds.<br />-  There are so many poignant moments in this book, moments of heartbreak, despair, fury, and tenderness.  Mockingjay brought me to tears more than once, but alongside the pain and grief that several of the characters in this book must endure, there is an underlying thread of hope and perseverance, and I loved that.<br /><br />What I Wished:<br />-  I wanted Peeta to have more time on the page.  I know this is a fairly selfish desire brought on by the fact that I love his character and can never really get enough of him.  There were certainly valid reasons for his lack of page-time, but that didn't stop me from wishing we got to see more of him in this final book.<br />-  Since this series follows Katniss in first-person, present tense, when her perspective narrows or is overwhelmed by her own situation, our view of her world also shrinks dramatically.  I'm finding it difficult to phrase this clearly without revealing spoilers, but basically I occasionally wanted to see more of what was happening all over Panem and not just focus on Katniss' corner of the world.<br /><br />Mockingjay provides an emotionally powerful conclusion to one of the best YA series I've ever read.  It reveals a wider view of Panem than the first two books since Katniss' knowledge of (and effect on) life in all thirteen districts has grown considerably over the course of the series.  The war-time action is brutal, realistic, and often inexcusable in a way that makes a very strong statement.  Don't expect a light and fluffy read out of this book, but do expect to be absolutely riveted to the pages.emotionally powerful conclusion to one of the best YA series I've ever read.

0743496736|5.0|If you want to really understand the psychosis of teenagers and the throes to which one who is really disturbed would go to in the name of revenge, then you could do much worse than Jodi Picoult's \\"19 Minutes\\". True, this work is, at times, predictable and formulaic but Picoult is, nevertheless, successful at presenting the true essence of the mind of a teen who decides that revenge is the only option left in life and walks into his high school and systematically shoots dozens of his classmates.    Picoult's ability to tell a story is really amplified here against the backdrop of the school shooting. Drawing on actual events from Columbine and Paducah, Peter Houghton is the maligned teen who's been bullied all his life and attempts to extract his toll by killing the jocks and popular crowd...\\"they started it\\" he says as he's caught and arrested. This, by itself, is what makes this book different from other school shooting studies and allows Picoult a large canvas to expand the storyline. As most are aware, most school shootings not only end with carnage of innocent victims, but also with the inevitable suicide of the killer(s). The fact that Houghton is caught and his crime can be explained through an analysis and perspective of the killer, his life and influences is reason enough to take on this book...it really shows a different aspect of a, unfortunately, more and more common occurrence.      Picoult then weaves a tangible story around this angle...the character development here is an amazing strength of her writing, but this is apparently standard for this gifted novelist (I've not had an opportunity to read any of her other works, though). We see the family of the killer intertwined with friends and other associates that give a ring of believability to the story.     It's long been my belief that in these stories of revenge tinged school shootings, the author must develop the anger aspect of the killer's personality...the real truth, however,  sometimes (as inthe Columbine case) is a lot more complex, i.e. the killers have a lot of excess baggage that adds to their personality complexity. This often gives the impression that the killers are \\"normal\\" when in fact they possess a huge amount of problems...trying to convey this baggage in a book of this length gets too complicated. Indeed many post Columbine stories concentrate on this \\"normal\\" aspect and lose the anger associated with revenge and the story suffers as a result. Not here though as Picoult goes right for the jugular (no pun or disrespect intended) while spinning a surrounding plot that fortifies the psychosis while telling a great story. To go into the characters would definitely be a story spoiler.    I found this work, admittedly, while doing continued research into the Columbine shootings...Picoult isn't intent here on copying that tragic event, but, I believe, conveying the anger, sadness and horror of the shooting. For that I think she has succeeded tremendously.
B000001FDK|4.0|I think this soundtrack is fun to listen to.  It has some good songs and some that are just campy and amusing.  I really like the CD more than the actual movie.
0061148512|5.0|This book is great. It is so nice to see a book written in this time period, about the time period. The sad story in this book gave great insight into the treatment of women, both in normal society and in mental institutions. It painted a clear picture of what was typical of women at this time, such as typical schooling, dating and sexuality in relationships, and \\"normal\\" behavior.  As someone interested in entering the mental health field, it really shows the changes that have been made to the health care system and how some people were stuck in the system based on their lack of funds and availability of skilled and caring doctors.

B003NWS5AO|5.0|Again, I am a huge Robert Plant fan so he walks on water in my eyes. This cd reminds me somewhat of the type of work he did with Allison Krauss in that it's that kind of watery, hushed, soulful music. Roberts voice is like warm chocolate velvet and I can't get enough of it. For him, music is his craft and he is a magician. Musical alchemy, plain and simple.
B003O85W3A|3.0|Like Rush, R.E.M., The Cure and Radiohead before them, Arcade Fire seem bent on making unintelligible college-rock music that while often times musically engaging, is lyrically obtuse. One criteria that I use in determining whether an album is classic or merely just good. \\"The Suburbs\\" continues Arcade Fire's reach for artistic merits, but the album falls short--somewhere between good and very good, but not great or classic.<br /><br />When I see 16 tracks on an album I get nervous. Very few artists can pull off a lengthy 16 track opus, but Arcade Fire do a reasonably good job of it. The album is not boring overall, but there are a few tracks that could have been left on the cutting room floor, or as b-sides. The quality of the musical arrangements, melodies and compositions fit together well as a whole entity, but not individually. There are no really memorable tracks here, they all kind of compliment one another.<br /><br />The standout tracks to me were \\"Modern Man\\", \\"City With No Children\\", \\"Half Light II\\", \\"Suburban War\\", \\"We Used To Wait\\" and \\"Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains\\". The rest of the tracks were serviceable. I have been listening to pop/rock music for so many years now that I could not help but notice a few riffs borrowed from other pop/rock songs. For example, \\"City With No Children\\" has a guitar riff that comes dangerously close to The Rolling Stones' \\"Street Fighting Man\\" just change up slightly. \\"Sprawl II\\" has a synthesizer riff that's very similar to Julian Lennon's \\"Stick Around\\".<br /><br />But it's the lyrics that I really come back to. Arcade Fire has, from the very beginning, been an intangible entity. Like R.E.M., you have to revert to the lyric book just to figure out what they're singing about, but even then you are left with a rather oblique picture. It wasn't until later in their career, that R.E.M. started writing songs that were more accessible, and their popularity grew exponentially. For their first four albums, they were relatively obscure and mainly college rock. Fellow countrymen, Rush, had their first seven albums filled with fantasy/sci-fi themes that really didn't connect to a larger audience, and it wasn't until their eighth album that they really hit their stride combining lyrics and music as a whole. I feel that same issue plagues Arcade Fire. \\"The Suburbs\\" is not accessible. No matter how many times I reviewed the lyric sheet, I found my mind wandering off and listening to the melodies and arrangements instead.<br /><br />Musically, the band has changed slightly from album to album, but they are still recognizable as Arcade Fire. I guess what I am getting at here is that the band has room to grow. They are not a winner right out of the gate like some bands, nor are they one dimensional like some other bands. They sit poised to be as great as R.E.M. or Rush or even Radiohead, but they are not quite there yet. They seem to feeling their way still, but I believe they are capable of great things musically--it's there, when you listen to what they are doing, they just need a producer to harness and capture their essence.<br /><br />Here's how \\"The Suburbs\\" compares to Arcade Fire's other works:<br /><br />2004 Funeral: Four Stars<br />2007 Neon Bible: Three and a Half Stars<br />2010 The Suburbs: Three and a Half Starsly college rock.

B002WY65VU|3.0|*** This review contains spoilers ***<br /><br />  I was pleasantly surprised with the first third of 'Zombieland' when I discovered it's more like a comic buddy road movie than some dumb horror slasher-fest. The introductory 'documentary' sets the comic tone: right off the bat Zombieland announces that it's not politically correct (a \\"fatty\\" is unable to outrun a Zombie on an athletic field). Jesse Eisenberg's narration, with all his neat rules on how to survive in Zombieland, adds to the overall humor of the story (the \\"rules\\" are illustrated twice--first during the introduction and then later as we follow Jesse's character 'Columbus' as he must personally survive the wrath of the Zombies). Perhaps the rules that garnered the most cinematic mileage were \\"Double Tap\\" (it takes two blows to kill a Zombie) and \\"Fasten Your Seat Belt\\" (you never know when you have to stop short and have a Zombie fly through your windshield!).<br /><br />  Zombieland is set in a post-apocalyptic America where a strain of Mad Cow Disease has turned most people into Zombies. Instead of merely concentrating on the Zombies for most of the picture, the films' scenarists wisely focus on the relationship between Columbus and his redneck buddy, Tallahassee (well-played by Woody Harrelson). Tallahassee's love for Twinkies and his skill in taking out the Zombies with various weapons of choice makes the character interesting. He's nicely contrasted with Columbus, the obsessive-compulsive nerdy college kid, who needs to overcome a clown phobia before he can finally break loose in his interpersonal relationships.<br /><br />  Since I like my fantasy pictures to be as plausible as my true-life dramas, I found the flashback scene where Columbus must fend off the young girl he takes in to his apartment as particularly weak. It's not that I minded her sudden transformation into a Zombie, but what happened to all the other college students in Columbus' dorm? Did they all turn into Zombies at the same time the young girl did? And why didn't we see any news reports that people were turning into Zombies? It's as if the transformation from America into Zombieland happened in one night.<br /><br />  Once Columbus and Tallahassee meet up with the two young women, \\"Wichita\\" and \\"Little Rock\\", I felt the story began to lose steam. I didn't really care that the two women were con men and were able to steal our hapless hero's' SUV. And the second scene, where they all agree to a truce and sort of become friends seemed interminably long.<br /><br />  Before they get to Hollywood, there's a rather unpleasant scene where Tallahassee (with the others joining him) destroy souvenirs in a Native-American tourist shop. While the knick-knacks were probably made in China, they still looked pretty good to me and even though this was supposed to be a post-apocalyptic landscape where private property was now irrelevant, the destruction of what appeared to be a part of Native-American culture still rubbed me the wrong way.<br /><br />  Somehow, the Billy Murray cameo was supposed to be funny and it makes sense that Murray would have survived the Zombie plague in real life. But the ending of the cameo wasn't funny as Columbus mistakenly shoots and kills Murray after he mistakes him for a Zombie.<br /><br />  Tallahassee's internal arc seems to be resolved when Columbus does finally realize his buddy has a sensitive side; he discovers that Tallahassee has been been pining away for his young son rather than his dog.<br /><br />  The film's denouement seemed quite abrupt. Columbus and Tallahassee must rush to the Pacific Playland Amusement Park to save the two young women who are trapped there. Card carrying members of the NRA should enjoy all the firepower as the two heroes save the women after blasting hordes of Zombies who have come after them. Columbus's internal arc is resolved when he falls in love with Wichita (now revealed to be 'Krista').<br /><br />  And that's basically it. The foursome ride off into the sunset with no particular destination in mind. Presumably more encounters with Zombie are in store for them. Will there be a Zombieland II? Frankly, I hope not. There are just so many Zombies one can take!tination in mind. Presumably more encounters with Zombie are in store for them. Will there be a Zombieland II? Frankly, I hope not.

B000002U8G|5.0|Meddle one of the greatest albums from pink floyd that I enjoy listening too, but again I like em all except for the final cut.      One of these days and echos are the best songs on the album but the others arent too bad as well.    Echos is over 20 mins long an partly instrumental which sounds a little like nature music like elements of it(the instrumental parts)..an if you ever heard of the band called OZRIC TENTACLES? The echos song an shine on you crazy diamond sounds a little like Ozric Tentacles band. But it was before the ozric's existed although because they didnt start till 1985 an pink floyd came at late 1960s.    Some of the songs from PF is a little commericalism an over rated like another brick in the wall part 2, because its played on radio stations...but I don't care which band is (main stream), an which isn't...    But anyway this album, along with others like the wall, etc. R good stuff.    Most people that say they like pink floyd..only like the main stream popular songs, but theres a tons of good PF songs thats arent on stupid radio stations.    piece.
B003V5PPZG|2.0|I remember Radiohead lost some fans when they dropped Kid A and then Amnesiac. The sudden lack of guitars, experimentation with vocal styles and general weirdness did some people in with the band. But once I listened a few times and got over how different it was from their older stuff, I realized that each song still had everything I looked for in a Radiohead track - hooks; catchy choruses; thoughtful, puzzling lyrics; melodic vocals. The more accessible pieces like Pyramid Song and Idioteque weren't the only good songs either; most of the songs from the new Radiohead were listenable and enjoyable if you kept an open mind. I've also been a fan of Silverchair since its origins as a Nirvana clone to its more recent experimentation with mixes of electronic and orchestral music and the vocal change from favouring grunge screaming to a preference for melodic falsetto.     So I don't have a problem with a band reinventing itself, and they don't have to sound anything like they did a few years ago for me to continue appreciating them; in fact, I didn't have a problem with the changes to Linkin Park's style in Minutes to Midnight. But I've listened to this new album a couple of times and I can't get into it. I read a review that said the blending of different styles is true to the essence of the idea behind the band and its original name - Hybrid Theory - but who cares if it's true to the band's original intentions? There's nothing that makes me want to listen to most of these songs again - except \\"the catalyst\\", \\"Waiting For The End\\", and maybe \\"blackout\\" - and songs need to stand on their own without knowing the life story of the people who created them, so the message from Linkin Park in the product description on Amazon doesn't change my impression of the album either. I also haven't been able to find the motivation to watch the \\"making of\\" DVD that comes with the edition of the album that I bought. I don't need to hear the explanations - it's just weird and different for the sake of it, with tracks that seem to exist for the sole purpose of being non-commercial. There is a thin line between not being commercial and sucking.     But to be in a position to release an album that is not commercial must be important to the band. I have listened to demo versions of songs like \\"in the end\\" and \\"crawling\\" on the Internet, and I noted that - especially in the case of \\"in the end\\" - those songs originally contained some more cerebral and poetic lyrics that the studio may have pressured the band into dumbing down. So perhaps an album like A Thousand Suns is something they needed to get out of their system. Maybe their next album will be better.

0399156577|1.0|I am a huge Nora Roberts fan, always look forward to her new releases and usually buy them the day they come out. I didn't love her last \\"big Nora\\" though, so I held off on buying The Search, instead getting it from the library. Boy, am I glad I did!    I don't love dogs, but the dog training scenes were the best part of the book. I think those scenes gave the most characterization and insight into both the leads. I didn't care for Simon--he just didn't grab me. Plus, I couldn't tell what he looked like, a rarity for a NR hero.     The search & rescue scenes were intriguing--I'm not an expert so I can't tell if, as others have noted, there were errors in them.     I do live in the Pacific Northwest and very much doubt that someone who lived on the mainland would trek all the way to Orcas island for dog training classes. And, there was a bit about a supporting character popping off to Seattle for a date--that's a 2 1/2 hour+ trip unless you take an airplane. There was no mention of Kenmore air, the local island hopping airline--that would have made chunks of the story make more sense in terms of timing.     The book, like all the \\"big Noras\\" is supposed to be romantic suspense. Well, the romance didn't grab me, the suspense was close to nil and all in all, I was just plain bored reading it. I had to force myself to keep picking it up.     Wait for the next J.D. Robb.

B003062NG0|4.0|This long out-of-print collection of B-sides and unreleased epics is one of the finest in PT's back catalog. I was so excited to see this being reissued at an affordable price. The original version will have its place with collectors, but this one is for the true fans (who couldn't afford to give up an organ to buy this). Steven (Wilson-founder, singer, guitarist, keyboardist, writer, producer, mixer of PT) knew that this travesty existed, recognized it, and did something positive about it. Kudos! Now all of us can have this gem in our players. This is a re-issue of the original recording (which is fantastic and in no need of re-mastering), so no need to get this if you already have it. It is beautifully packaged, a la Digi-book style, phenomenally well. The book portion has some period pics of the members of the band and there is a listing of which session or single these came from, which is helpful. That is about it, but what more would you get with any b-side collection? Personally, I would have loved to have read some explanations of why these tracks did not make it the first time around. Well, maybe when the re-master is done in 10 years! Hmmm that would be about 10 new souls, right Steve-o?
B003UYUQZW|2.0|I didn't care for the movie. I never played the game on the PS2 but I know it was very popular. I guess if you're a fan of something like kingdom of heaven or hidalgo you'd probably like this, but for me it was quite boring. I'd rather waste two hours on ostrich races. Interesting a disney movie actually focused on her cleavage in one scene. 2 stars- Cant recommend it sorry, you may feel different... echo that through the ages.

B0002S947K|5.0|I love this CD so much that, as soon as I noticed my daughter had taken off with my copy [because she loved it so much!] I ordered another one. I have turned several people on to Ray Lamontagne and they all have responded with thanks and every one has told me they listen to him regularly. If you're already a fan and you don't have this one, then you want to buy it. If you're not, buy this one first, and if you like this kind of music, then I can't imagine you wouldn't love it!
0439023513|5.0|The book was wonderful and was a well done closing book for the Hunger Games series
0786955570|5.0|I really enjoy this.  You can play with other people, or even by yourself.  There are 2 solo adventures included in the adventure book, but it's possible to play each of the characters by yourself as well.  This was very cleverly done - it seems impossible to make total dead ends and the monsters have an order of operation that keeps the person running them from having to make decisions about their activity.  The bosses have some neat abilities that take advantage of this game's unique mechanics. The Encounter cards are sometimes much too harsh, but that's the closest I can come to a criticism of this game.  I highly recommend it.  Also, it comes with minis which are the same ones released in their sets, just not painted.  They are theoretically usable in play of other D&D games beyond this one, perhaps as minions.  The white dracolich fills a definite hole in my collection.
B0036EH40Q|5.0|Over the years I have seen this film many many times, but ironically never owned the DVD, as for a long time it wasn't available. Fortunately this has enabled me to get the blu-ray edition without having to replace a DVD.<br /><br />The film: Most of us know the story which revolves around the famous shoot-out at the OK Corral. In my view this is the best of the many film versions you can get. The reasons are many, but Val Kilmers performance as Doc Holliday is first on the list. His delivery of some classic lines and his look are quite brilliant. Rest assured there some other teriffic performances, but his is the best by quite a margin. The direction is straightforward and the script keeps you guessing nicely in places. Sometimes the obvious doesn't happen.....<br /><br />Flaws: Its perhaps a little too long at 2:10 and maybe could have been trimmed a little. But I can't think where though, so this is a minor point.<br /><br />The Blu-ray: Overall this is a very good transfer to blu-ray. The picture is very sharp and the sound excellent. Only in a couple of interior shots could I fault the picture, where I thought it was a little grainy. Obviously I don't have a DVD to compare the blu-ray with but I'd be very surprised if its anywhere near as good overall.<br /><br />Extras: Not substantial, but there is a very good documentary with some comparitively recent interviews with the cast and some interesting historical background to the events portrayed and the lengths the production team went for historical accuracy. For example they used the actual Wyatt Earp Peacemaker in the film (his gun).<br /><br />Overall: 5 stars no question!

B003O8NATS|5.0|The second book in the Millenium trilogy was just as good as the first (The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo) and led me to impatiently await the arrival of the third book (The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets Nest). Book two picks up about a year after the events of the first book and slowly fills in the gaps as the story unfolds. Book three will pick up right where book two leaves off. Adult content that might not be suitable for young readers.

0316098337|5.0|I loved this novel.  I must admit that I almost put it down in the beginning. The reason? The narrator is a five year old boy, and while Emma Donoghue has an excellent ear for the syntax and vocabulary of the speech of a five year old, I didn't think the kid's voice could hold me for an entire novel. This narrative is so expertly plotted, however (in places it reads like a gripping detective novel), that I was hooked.<br /><br />In some ways, the story of Ma and Jack is familiar. Ma, a college student kidnapped when she was nineteen, is a hostage, and her pattern of submission, resistance, and careful plotting in Room resembles that of many hostage narratives, like the men who were held in Beirut in the eighties. In fact, the Oprah-like television host who interviews her late in the novel knows enough about this to employ terms like \\"Stockholm Syndrome,\\" although the glib terminology trivializes Ma's own experience.<br /><br />Jack's story is a different one than his Ma's. People have been interested in so-called feral children for centuries. Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein,\\" to use just one example, explores this theme. I couldn't help but think of Shelley's Creature forming his impressions of human society by peering through the cottage window of the DeLacey family. Jack, however, has Ma to help socialize him, along with that indispensable window onto culture, the TV, whose scenes he associates with Outside, a place he assumes is not real until his mother \\"unlies\\" to him when he is five and he learns that the TV world is, to some extent, a portrait of a real place. Still, for Jack, his beloved Dora the Explorer is as \\"real\\" as the people he sees on cooking shows or on the news.<br /><br />\\"Room\\" is also social satire, with its sharp depiction of the flow of imagery through the TV of Room and, later, with the intricate and often amusing interactions between a puzzled Outside and an even more puzzled Jack.  Above all, the novel is a philosophical exploration of how children learn to make sense of the world, even when it is a musty, lightless room from which there is no escape. Inside Room, Jack's body is malnourished and his social awareness underdeveloped, but his mind, nurtured by Ma, flourishes in the most unexpected ways. Donoghue's \\"Room\\" is a tour de force, unlike anything I've read in quite a long time. I've switched allegiance. I was rooting for Peter Carey to win the Man Booker Prize (\\"Room\\" is also on the short list), but now I'm cheering for Emma Donoghue.<br />M.

B001IBIHQ4|4.0|Much has been said about the difference between BoB & The Pacific mini-series'. Obviously BoB had the perfect start up where the series began with training. This allowed the viewer to 'get-to-meet' the cast of real life characters close up. This is essential in any series - the viewers have to connect with the characters. The Pacific writers obviously chose not to do that this time and introduced us to the cast in a drip feed method in between battles. This put the series on the back foot as we didn't really know who we were losing - due to little heart connection.<br /><br />As for the battles themselves - The Pacific theatre was unique. Unlike Europe, where Patton could attack, meet resistance, shift direction, force a hole, outflank, breakthrough and fan out - in the Pacific, most of these battle tactics counted for zip. There were few lulls in the battle, precious little cover and an intensely humid tropical environment - it was no holds barred kill or be killed until every enemy was eliminated. Where US Forces retreated and regrouped in the Battle of the Bulge, the US Marines & Army could only retreat into the sea.<br /><br />And the enemy was vastly different. Where the German soldier was exceptionally tactical & clinical...the Japanese trooper was fanatical. There has been plenty written about their battle code so I won't repeat it here. The Clint Eastwood film \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" best describes the Japanese experience from a personal level.<br /><br />I recommend you watch this series without all the distracting ads and see it as a good visual history lesson. Hopefully it'll be our last World War!

B003J7HOKU|5.0|This album hasn't left my cd player in a month! Usually there are a few tracks on every album that I could just do without, but this one is solid.
B003L77TZI|4.0|A Wondeful album full of potential singles and hits. Only a couple songs that aren't enjoyable.  Teenage Dream: 8.0/10: A very fun song with a catchy and cute beat and very teenage like lyrics talking about a young relationship. I have alway enjoyed Katy Perry much better than Lady Gaga because she adds in a little rock feeling that keeps me attached.    Last Friday Night (TGIF): 6.2/10: Not as powerful as Teenage Dream but still has a fun summer feeling that keeps me listening to it. The only part I really don't like is when they cheer like cheerleaders and lead into a synthesizer solo.    California Gurls: 7.0/10: The video is like a mini porno but the song is catchy and makes me feel like hitting the beach and banging around with Katy Perry but thats just a fantasy that will probably never come true. The video is the best part because its full of pizazze and is full of cliches. This video is memorable in the way of seeing how much a video can get away with to air on TV.    Firework: 9.0/10: Probably my second favorite song on the CD just because its powerful int he way that it builds up into the chorus.I love the whole meaning of the song and thsi could possibly be the most radio friendly song on this CD.    Peacock: 3.0/10: Possibly the worst song on the album just because of the repetitive Peacock line that complely makes me want to turn the CD off. The only good part about the song is the verse which is half catchy.    Circle the Drain: 10/10: My favorite song on the CD, its so dark and unlike Katy Perry. The lyrics are amazing the chorus is the ebst on the CD. The most non radio friendly song besides Peacock but totally amazing. If you're going to listen to something of hers let it be this.    The One That Got Away: 6.5/10: A good song but its beat is forgettable and its lyrics aren't very important, just another love story song.    E.T (Futuristic Lover): 8.0/10: A very catachy and technical song that has a very catchy and memorable beat and a great and powerful chorus that revolve once again about love with a futuristic lover. Great Song    Who Am I Living For: 6.0/10: A Song suppose to be like ET but dosen't surpass it because its beat is much slower and simpiler which kind of turns me off from the song. Its a good song for lovers that have lost there loved one.    Pearl: 6.8/10: A Good song with great lyrics but a forgettable tone. Overall and average song with extrodinary lyrics. The best part of the song is the powerful chorus that shows Perry's vocal range.    Hummingbird Heartbeat: 7.8/10: A Great song with a powerful beat and very catchy lyrical pattern. The Chorus is once again very powerful and amazingly memorable because of the simplicity of the lyrics. Overall the lyrics are hard the follow because she's singing so fast.    Not Like the Movies: 7.5/10: The Best and only ballad on the CD but also the lyrics are very unusual as most of her songs are. Their is just a reason that I can't explain about this song, I don't really know why I like it, all I know is that its a good song that ends the album perfectly.    Good Album. Good Songs. Great Buy

0061906220|5.0|As a primary teacher with 35 years of book reading under my belt, I have to say this is one of the BEST books I've ever used in the classroom!  It's bound to become a classic!  It has all the elements of a great children's story that teachers look for.  First of all, kids take to it like a duck to water! It's the first book to fly off the shelves when we have our daily \\"Book Look.\\"   I love it myself so I want to read it over and over again too.  It's a perfect circle story!  I can use it to teach the literary concept of a \\"circular journey.\\"  It easy to dramatize.  You only have to read it once and the kids can act it out themselves.  It's true to life... who hasn't experienced the downfall of brand-new shoes?  Every child (and adult) can relate!   And best of all... it teaches a real life lesson in a comical way.  The kids GET it!  No use crying over spilt milk!  Pick up the pieces and get on with your life.  Resiliency is such an important trait to develop in young people!      I notice the School Library Journal review mentions that kids might feel powerless after reading this book but they've certainly got it backwards!  This book does just the opposite!  It shows children that they are masters of their own lives.  They don't need to succumb to every problem that faces them!  It teaches them that they have control over their own perceptions and choices--even in apparently poor circumstances.  What better lesson to learn early in life??  This book so matches the discipline approach that I personally use in my teaching (Marvin Marshall's Discipline without Stress, Punishments or Rewards,) that I posted a lesson plan on my discipline blog.  It contains several lesson ideas and links.      I found this book due to a million exclamations over it on teacher mailgroups this past summer.  Teachers recognize a keeper when they see it!  I quickly ordered a copy of it and now I'm thinking of getting a few extra copies for my classroom shelf. It would also make a great baby gift!
B002EWD0I6|5.0|You know, people are the same basically throughout the ages. We experience the same joys and sadnesses, the hopes and disappointments, and the basic human idiosyncrasies as people in the past. This ongoing story of the day to day interaction of a 19th Century English local town and hamlet is truly a delight. The characters, costuming and sets are perfect. This series has well written dialogue that makes you want to listen to every syllable so that nothing is missed. Well Done, BBC! We are looking forward to more episodes!!
B003HTPHSQ|5.0|There isn't a bad song on the whole CD.  Cyndi's voice is at it's best and lends itself to this type of music.  Her band is absolutely 'spot on'.  A friend of mine said that it is very sensual music & she's right!  We listened to it on the way to Memphis' Beale St.
0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire deals with the aftermath of the original Hunger Games. Katniss and Peeta have returned to District 12 as champions, but their victory is uneasy. Things have changed with Gale. Katniss is uneasy with fame. And the Capital is definitely not happy with Katniss.<br /><br />I really regret that I didn't read this book sooner because I wish I'd had more time to think about it before diving into Mockingjay the next day. Unlike the other two books, which are more focused on a single plotline, Catching Fire contains a variety of stories, and Katniss interacts with more people. There are also a variety settings, and this book isn't just a repeat of The Hunger Games, which I was worried about. I thought it would just be a bridge between books one and three, but it really stands on its own in terms of quality.<br /><br />Catching Fire is an excellent second book in this trilogy, and readers new to the series are in for a treat.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I have to say, I haven't seen a gay interest film produced as well as this one. The story leaves you with a warm-hearted feeling that makes you want to watch the movie again. The acting was great and the quality of the film was terrific, especially when compared to other films. Great movie, I definitely recommend buying it. I did :]
B001BPQT8A|5.0|This movie has been one of my favorites since the first time I saw it at the theater. This print on Blu Ray takes it to a new level. Pristine picture and sound. Former prints I've seen have been somewhat grainy in the dark scenes but not on this print. All that can be said about the movie has been said. Great acting, tight direction, and one of the best endings ever.
B000W7JWUA|3.0|Once upon a time, Settlers was a \\"must have\\" game.  It's still fun to play, but newer games are better uses of your money.    In particular, I recommend:  [[ASIN:B001UH9FHQ Rio Grande Games Carcassonne Big Box # 2]]  [[ASIN:158994755X Ad Astra]]  [[ASIN:B001JQY6K4 Dominion]]    For those who are not familiar with Settlers, it is a family oriented German style board game.  Like all German style games, the rules are simple, and the game is relatively short to play.  Because it is family oriented, the strategic complexity is fairly limited.    Game play is simple.  The winner is the first person to get 10 points.  The board is randomly created and then players select their starting positions.  Turns start with the first player and go around the table.  Each turn, dice are rolled to determine what resources players get, then the player whose turn it is can trade with the other players and try to buy/build things that will get points or prevent other players from doing so.    There are several expansions that add more strategic depth.  Aside form the 5-6 player expansion to the basic game, I do not recommend them.  There are better games if you want something more strategic.  For example:  [[ASIN:B001C7617Q Agricola]]  [[ASIN:B00008URUT Puerto Rico]]  [[ASIN:B001HBJ3YU Mayfair Games Tigris and Euphrates - Double Scenario Edition]]    Although Settlers is a classic of the genre, the game is well past it's prime.  Newer games in this style are simply better.  Although it can be great fun, the game is not without it's problems.    First, newer games have mechanics that try to make them end consistently after a certain amount of play time; Setters does not.  Officially the game takes 90 minutes, but I've had games that only lasted 45 and I've played games that lasted 180.  How long the game lasts is strongly dependent on the configuration of the board and the luck of the dice.  Similarly, newer games are better at controlling the luck component and emphasizing strategy.  When compared to newer games, this one gets \\"old\\" too quickly -- the strategic options are fairly simple.  Finally, the \\"lag\\" between each player taking an action is fairly long compared to other games.  Consequently, Settlers feels slower than it should.    Above, I recommended three alternatives.  I'll briefly explain:    Carcassonne is the \\"other\\" classic.  Unlike Settlers, it has held up fairly well with age and doesn't suffer from the problems discussed above.  Furthermore, the \\"Big Box\\" comes with all of the good expansions, giving you much more \\"game\\" for your money.    Ad Astra is a recent \\"clone\\" of Settlers.  It's fundamentally the same game with different art and slightly modified rules.  The modifications are all for the better -- Ad Astra has a more consistent play time, more strategic depth, and much less randomness.  It's simply a better version of this game.    Dominion, simplistically, is Settlers played with cards instead of dice.  It moves faster, takes less time to play, and has substantially more strategic depth for the same level of rules complexity.  Unless having to shuffle cards is a problem (say for a 10 year old player), I'd recommend Dominion as the best of the three alternatives I've suggested.

B00009Z574|2.0|... showing there was no more direction among Yes, at the time.    Some talent, maybe, but no direction. Good musicians who were a bit puzzled about what their music should become at the turn of the decade.    Production values are extremeley poor, and not only because of Wakeman's terrible Birotron.     White's drums sound as if recorded from the farm on the other side of the valley. Drum sound had improved in rock  constantly during the 70s (it was its weak point), but here you get the feeling no-one got the news. The drum sound is weak, shallow, like we're back in 1970 when drumming wasn't clearly distinguished from percussion.     Anderson's voice is OK but nothing exceptional, it's harmless, mere routine, no lyrical heights like on \\"Going For The One\\" or \\"Gates of Delirium\\". No will to try anything new, I suppose. Anderson's vocal performances have always been closely linked to the content he sings. His lyrics here lack strong images, mystery. The words don't come out of the heart and the brain as before, only from the heart. Hence his lack of conviction in singing them. Even \\"Don't Kill the whale\\", whose theme should have urge him to let go, sounds tame. Political correctness 20 years in advance.    Chris Squire's fat sound bass is good, but lacks the energy of the 1972-1974 era and isn't as catchy, straightforward as it will be with 90125. Tormato is a transition album for Squire.    Howe delivers the goods, no more, no less. Same problem than with Anderson, IMO: he didn't write many songs and had nothing fresh in mind for those he wrote, so he wasn't very motivated in playing on the rest (Howe isn't too fond of playing on others' tracks, ask Trevor Rabin). His work on Drama will be far better, because on Drama you can clearly hear he worked on the structure of the songs (OK, apart from \\"Man in a white car\\", which is a Buggles' song anyway). That makes all the difference. Being kindly allowed to play a solo on a song, and building it from out of the blue aretwo different things.    On Tormato the guys never really play together, no groove, no musical blending. We're back to the days of Topographic oceans, where they all \\"did their thing\\" one after another without any real conscience of the songs as part of a whole project. No fusion like on \\"Awaken\\", not speaking of \\"Close To The Edge\\". Sometimes, 2 or 3 guys try to start soemthing, but it doesn't last. Probably because the song s are written by only 1 or 2 of them. Maybe a producer would have helped pulling the right strings and creating a true unison. Here, there's none. Howe does his thing, then it's Wakeman, then Anderson starts the second verse... And so on during 50 minutes.    That's a pity because there were some very good demos recorded at that time. They are very hard to find now, but there was \\"Railway 14\\", a strange hypnotic jam including White, Howe and Squire which sounded a bit like 80s' King Crimson (Beat). If they had let Railway 14 grow, maybe Yes would have invented something new and pulled the rug under Fripp's feet - and done their work as a prog-rock band! There was also a very slow, sad, song whose title im not sure of, maybe \\"a Golden Age\\", where Anderson sang in a very unusual and elegiac way, with a nice build up from Squire and White. And there was also the VERY weird \\"Dance Through The Light\\" (later reworked on Drama as \\"Run through the light\\"), a potential hit with its catchy disco beat (!).    Why these songs have not been included here instead of \\"Future Times\\", \\"Circus of Heaven\\" or \\"Arriving UFO\\" is a mystery to me.    As another reviewered pointed out, Anderson and Wakeman started lo lack some inspiration by the time. White, Squire and to a lesser degree Howe, still had things to say (as Drama proved it) but 3 inspired musicians out of 5 is not a satisfying percentage for Yes.     If Trevor Horn had met Squire 2 years earlier, in 1978 instead of 1980, I'm sure Tormato would have been a very different record, possible the equivalent ofThe Yes Album for the ucoming eighties.    To end up with this review, of course, the reason one likes a song or not is personal (musicians will probably appreciate Howe's or Squire's playing here and there) , but in terms of songwriting there's hardly anything new to the ear or exciting on Tormato, and that's the criterion of a good prog rock record, in my opinion. I appreciate \\"Onward\\" because its a nice change of register from the usual stuff, but I agree it's more a Chris Squire's effort than a Yes effort (in fact there is no \\"Yes' effort on Tormato, only individual ones). \\"On the silent wings of freedom\\" is great, but..... AAAARRGGHHHH! that synth solo! No way, sorry.    For short, a misfire. But no swan song, because some potential clearly remained - but with due respect to Anderson and Wakeman, it needed another human alchemy.

B002VECLVO|4.0|A bit heavy handed with pretentious visuals, A Single Man is saved by its dialogue, which is often very sharp, and by some wonderful acting by the principles. Colin Firth hits all the right notes as a man who has lost the love of his life. Julianne Moore is splendidly over the top as an aged beauty. The interaction between these two actors is fabulous. The background music, mostly Eastern European sounding waltzes, seems out of place. The dream sequences were so overdone that they took me away from the story. Those criticisms aside, if you want to see real grown ups interact like real adults who have experienced loss, this movie will likely appeal.
044654146X|5.0|Startup Nation is the super creative spotlight that shines the light on why such a small isolated nation, filled with handicaps and limited resources, has flourished.<br /><br />Startup nation examines how and why the creative process is different than almost every other industrialized nation. The startup business process is a fight, a struggle within that produces energy,growth and change.<br /><br />This should be a must read for anyone interested in the application of the creative process..ie...how to foster creative minds that can adjust and produce results within a group setting.<br /><br />Korea, both South and North Korea, the Tiger and Mouse of Asia could well follow this example.Few countries around the world implement such a simple concept.War,peace,growth,and sound economic policy can create a strange bedfellow of success.<br /><br />This book should be a first week read for any business school freshman and a first day read for any student of psychology.<br /><br />Troytex in Texas  Sept.18, 2010
0374158460|5.0|Franzen knocked this one out of the park.  I re-read \\"The Corrections\\" before reading this and \\"Freedom\\" is quite a bit better; \\"Freedom\\" never goes for farce and eschews the cheap laugh at the characters' expense, and is structured better, with more of a wrap up than most modern novels.  It is also full of hints and foreshadowing that would make a second read worthwhile.  I am not sure if this will hold up for 200 years (as someone said in a review elsewhere) but it really nails our times and this decade.  I've never read anyone better at capturing family dynamics.  The characters (who are able to do so) figure themselves out over time.  They pay dearly for their shortsightedness, their lack of empathy, and their nostalgia, just like we all do.     I close with a note to folks who are likely to succumb to badmouthing the book over Walter Burglund's liberal environmental politics and (to a lesser extent) Walter's Iraq war opinons-- Dont do it!  It's not essential to the book!  You will still get him as a character; his idealism (as another Amazon reviewer said) ruins his life, the fact that it is \\"lefty\\" idealism is in no way essential to your enjoyment of his family story. Really.
B002CAWNEM|2.0|This movie is very predictable and follows the exact script of so many of those movies made for the \\"Lifetime\\" movie network. A married man stalked and harrassed by a beautiful temptress.<br /><br />Tiger Woods would have not resisted, but can the man in this movie resist her advances? She is super-model hot, so any man would have difficulty in this situation.<br /><br />I recommend this if you want to rent a movie for your date night with your female companion, especially if she loves \\"Lifetime-style\\" movies. Do not pay more than $5.00 if you buy it!<br /><br />Thank you for reading!
0312600844|1.0|I cannot believe I was duped by favorable reviews and paid almost full price for this book. I took it on a beach trip and was looking forward to hours engrossed in a good book. Instead, I had to force myself to half-skim it just to get my $28 worth. It is absolutely awful! The writing, which is medicore, isn't saved by an interesting, or even believable plot. The characters are shallow and not believable. Even the pro-environment sub-plot is contrived. In short, it is ridiculous and not worth any amount of time or money! I was a fan of The Corrections, and am convinced that the publisher was simply hoping for another money-maker under the Frazen name.
B001EYU1VO|1.0|I purchased this stick less than 1 year ago and it has flat out died on me.  The sensors started to fade over time, and the twist sensor died only a few months into the life of the stick.  It has easy to access buttons, and a nice dual throttle, but who really cares when the stick only lasts a few months?  I was amazed, this thing just quit on me and died.  I should have payed more attention to reviews.  Saitek makes highly adjustable products out of very flimsy materials.  The rumors about these products being very cheap and flimsy are true.  I've been careful with it as not to break any parts, but apparently even the internal sensors and parts are made out of poor quality materials as well.  I would not recommend anyone buy these joysticks if you plan on using it for more than a year.  I took very good care of it and it still died on me.  Terrible piece of hardware.

0143105035|5.0|Victor Frankenstein is driven by his hunger for scientific knowledge and accomplishment. What he can not know is that one day, after he creates a living, breathing being, he will regret his scientific pursuits. This created being is hideous and rejected by all who meet him, including his creator.  Rejection leads the creature to become a monster filled with despair and rage. In a futile attempt to pacify the creature, Victor agrees to create a female companion, but finds that he is unable to finish the task. At Victor's refusal to create the companion, the monster is filled with hatred and commits additional murders.  The only recourse for Victor is to pursue his creation and destroy it.<br /><br />This is not a book I would have chosen to read on my own. It was required reading for my current British Literature class and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  Mary Shelley used three characters to narrate during the story: Captain Walton, Victor Frankenstein and the creature. I thought the chapters narrated by the monster were particularly interesting. They developed the character of the monster beyond just a hideous, killing machine. It gave insight was to why the monster behaved in the way he did. I suspect that Mary Shelley may have been making a statement about children.  The creature craved love, affection and acceptance, just as all children do. Yet, when rejected and deprived of natural affection, the creature became a monster filled with pain and anger.<br /><br />Mary Shelley was the daughter of writer Mary Wollstonecraft and the wife of poet Percy Shelley. I especially liked how Mary Shelley used some of her husband's poetry in the narrative of the story. The story behind the creation of this book is also unique. Mary and Percy were part of a small group which agreed that they would each write a ghost story. After being unable to think of a plot, Mary Shelley conceived the concept of Frankenstein during a resting period when she was neither conscious nor completely asleep.<br /><br />This particular edition included an Introduction, Further Reading, Notes on the text, the Author's Introduction, a Preface by Percy Shelley and appendixes featuring works by others that were part of the group that committed to writing ghost stories.or completely asleep.<br /><br />This particular edition included an Introduction, Further Reading, Notes on the text, the Author's Introduction, a Preface by Percy Shelley and appendixes featuring works by others that were part of the group that committed to writing ghost stories.
B003U0AHBO|1.0|I can't imagine anything surpassing this for sheer, unadulterated silliness. Trouble is, even if viewed as a comedy, it's not even funny - and it's certainly not that exciting. I guess Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett must have desperately needed the money to participate in this enormous turkey. Oh yes, one good thing - the artwork that accompanies the end titles. This is actually the most entertaining bit of the film.
0679420266|5.0|On the surface 'The Stranger' is the story of Meursault, who after attending his mother's funeral embarks on a series of events that ultimately lead to murder.<br /><br />The genius of this book is the first person narrative, offering a 'personal diary' of the character, a man struggling with a disconnect from society. He encounters people and situations that should inspire feelings in him but he recognizes they do not. Much like Nabokov's Humbert in 'Lolita,' the madman begins to convince his reader that he deserves sympathy, only to demonstrate to you yet again why he does not.<br /><br />At 117 pages it may be tempting to devour this book in one sitting, but I think it is well worth the time to comb these pages meticulously. The psychological depth of Camus' work truly lends itself to patience.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend this literary classic.  You might also check out Arthur Koestler's 'Darkness at Noon,' a lesser known novel of a former revolutionary leader caught up in Stalin's purges. Its insights into the mind of a condemned man are also astounding.

B002HFP0QU|5.0|Contrary to what some other reviewers have said, these ARE the original versions of the Bee Gees hits, they just sound better than I've ever heard them!

B0028RXXE8|5.0|I recently purchased \\"Rome: The Complete Series\\", and I couldn't be more pleased. Although the violence, some nudity and obscene language aren't for all audiences, this HBO masterpiece has incredible acting, a brilliant plot (with great occasional humor) based on a fascinating time in the Roman Empire, and even the music is captivating. This production does not intend to be 100% historically accurate, but if you have never delved into the Roman Empire, this series will enlighten you and you'll want to learn more.
1416955070|3.0|So much has been said about this book already. The main reason I bought this book was that I kept seeing it everywhere and everyone was talking about it!<br /><br />I did like this book, but not as much as everyone seems to have. I guess my expectations were too high or maybe I was expecting some kind of \\"groundbreaking\\" novel.<br /><br />Having said that , I still think that City of Bones was an enjoyable read and Cassandra Clare has created a truly fascinating world. It was interesting and even enchanting. The plot moved at a breakneck speed . There was not one dull moment. Further the mystery element added to the intriguing part.<br /><br />One of my major problems was with Jace. He seemed too arrogant and too similar to other YA fantasy heroes. He was so clich&eacute;d - arrogant , good-looking and having a tragic past. Moreover he was such a jerk sometimes and I do not find arrogance attractive or sexy!<br />Clary was not annoying nor the typical \\"damsel in distress\\", but she could be really childish and whiny at times.<br />I really liked Simon, maybe I am in the minority. I could relate to him - awkward, sweet , nerdy and loyal. I really felt bad for him.<br />There was a Deja Vu feeling throughout the novel , like I have read it somewhere. Though I couldn't pinpoint it, it kept reminding me of  other fantasy novels. And did anyone think that Valentine seemed like Voldemort, though much less interesting?<br /><br />Nevertheless, I have already bought the second part and will be reading it. City of Bones , though a bit disappointing , was intriguing enough for me to find out what happens next.<br />All in all , an entertaining novel and good for the fantasy lovers.<br /><br />Overall:<br />Engrossing and must be read atleast once<br />Recommended?<br />Yes, I guess. Most people have enjoyed this book. So I would say - go ahead and read it ! Make up your own mind.
0374158460|5.0|Jonathan Franzen has the gift of recreating life on the page.  Walter Berglund is as realistic a character to me as Mohun Biswas, Augustus McCrae, or The Man (The Road).  I also really enjoy Franzen's writing--it's just so beautiful and every word is perfectly chosen.  His observations are deadly accurate.  America values freedom, money, and competition.  Franzen shows the costs of those values--destruction of our ecosystem (Canterbridge Estates), seething anger toward our neighbors (Linda Hoffbauer), questionable morals demonstrated to our children (Joey Berglund), depression (Patty Berglund and Connie Monaghan),isolation (all the characters at one time or another), and obsession (Walter and Bobby the Cat).  Thankfully, though, there's also redemption for these characters.  I'm still processing this book (it's so rich!).  But I can tell you that it makes me want to be a better person/parent, to learn about myself, and to examine my values so that I never have to suffer the way these characters did.
B000TGJ80S|4.0|Bram Stoker's Dracula is another entry in the trend of pro-vampire movies, portraying Vlad Dracul as a sympathetic character, a religious man who abandons God when his beloved, tricked into believing him dead, commits suicide while he is away fighting off the Turks. When he senses her reincarnation in Mina, the betrothed of Jonathan Harker, he sets in motion a plan to reunite with her. Chased by Jonathan and Van Helsing, he courts Mina and brings her closer to him. Will Dracula be successful, and win back his love, or will he meet his death at the hand of Van Helsing. An excellent movie, fascinatingly different than past treatments of Bram Stoker's novel, with stunning costumes and sets and a well-chosen cast. A lush movie for vampire lovers.
B002ZG9846|1.0|Good story, good acting but WAY TO VIOLENT.  VIOLENT, VIOLENT, VIOLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The VIOLENCE ruined the movie for me.
B001CZVVWS|4.0|It's nice to hear, but very unpleasant to watch ... Zeffirelli probably very tired, and Vasiliev, too. This Blue-ray may give you pleasure, if you turn off the TV.<br />New edition:<br />Excellent presentation! But, annoying the poor performance of TV producer. Vasiliev .. I live in Russia and this is the style I've seen 30 years ago in our theaters. I do not like. But the work of the costume-designer above all praise! What attention to detail! Representation is static and horizontal sticks, like a deep artistic image I still do not like. In short, the more pleased with the good that is in this play, the more sorrowful disadvantages.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|This was a terrific finish to a trilogy that keeps the reader wanting more and anticipating the outcome. Like the other two books before it, the main characters are the most unlikely people to be involved in finding the truth in a quagmire of political/criminal activity. The stories themselves might make one wonder if Sweden isn't another version of the Middle East in its treatment of women and women victims. But then again these are only stories aren't they? Political intrique at its best makes this book a page turner--especially if the previous two have been read. The only criticism I have (and thus 4 stars) is Larsson's penchant for bogging down in backgrounding some lesser characters who are introduced into the story. At times he seems to get carried away with the ancestry of these people as if that had any bearing on the story. Swedish place names, locales, businessnes etc. are at times bothersome for the non Swedish reader. But these can be overcome by merely skipping past them in the same manner trying to pronounce the names is done. Overall, this and the preceding books are worthy reads. Get ready to be physically exhausted, emotionally drained and kept up late at night. Cancel all your social plans.
0399156577|3.0|Fiona Bristow, an attractive redhead, lives on a pretty island off Seattle and is happily running a successful dog-training school. But things have not always been so rosy for Fee, as she's called. A few years back she was attacked by a serial killer and although she escaped, the man killed her boyfriend and left Fiona with nightmarish memories she can't quite forget. Then she meets Simon Doyle, a talented wood-working artist, who asks her for help in training his out-of-control puppy Jaws. It doesn't take Fee long to get the puppy straightened out or to fall for Simon, who reciprocates. The lovers have a lot going for them, but just when things seems perfect they learn there's a copycat killer on the loose. This awful person, who's mentally sick, has learned about Fiona and her escape from his mentor, who's now in prison, and is determined to finish her off himself. Lots of suspense follows as Fiona and Simon use their wits to outsmart this creep, and in betweeen there's plenty of smart sexy banter to keep the story going and satisfy the millions of Nora Roberts' fans.
B001FB5634|4.0|I wasn't sure if I should give this movie one star or five... I settled on four. .......(shaking head) I've never read the book so all I knew about the movie was a guy and his kid survive the end of the world and that was about it. They never say what it was that ended the planet. I'm guessing it was some kind of bomb but all that's left is man. No animals. No crops. No trees. Nothing.<br /><br />Within the first ten minutes of the movie I was in tears and I knew I'd be in for a rocky ride. I WAS NOT prepared for what this movie threw at me.<br /><br />Ok, the good. Why would I give the movie five stars? Excellent acting, incredible score. The movie sucks you right in and doesn't let go.<br />The direction is brilliant. The pacing is slow but deliberate and very effective. The movie is a masterpiece except for....<br /><br />The bad? Why would I give one star? Umm....I don't know how many of you have played the Resident Evil video games but when you stumble upon a big scary mansion looming in the mist, RUN THE OTHER WAY. Chances are said mansion will have scary, icky things in it.<br />And the mansion part of this movie will haunt me for years to come. YUCK! Not that this part of the movie is gory, it kind of is. It's the mental impact of what is happening in the mansion and really all over the Earth. This movie is the darkest, most depressing, desolate thing I have ever seen and I never want to see this movie again.<br /><br />I settled on four stars. The movie is a masterpiece and one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. It's not even technically a horror movie but that's what kind of impact it had on me. I guess what really scares me the most is the fact that this entire scenario is possible. Funny....that great thing we call the mind of man is what has elevated us from the club wielding/rock throwing days to where we are now as a species. It will be the same mind of man that reduces us right back to where we originated, maybe even worse if this movie is any indication.<br /><br />I pray the bombs never fly during my lifetime but if they do. I know where fallout shelters are... I won't be going. I'll go right outside and welcome the end with outstretched arms. Even if you did survive, what kind of life would be left for you or your loved ones? Is that really something you'd wish on them or yourself?<br /><br />If the end really was as bad as this...

B000M343BM|5.0|Charlie Sheen may have finally found his niche.  He's very good as a down and out hood wanna be ball player, that turns out to be an unlikely star.  The supporting players like Tom Berringer, Corbin Bernson, Wesley Snipes, are hilarious.  A great family movie, featuring the hapless Cleveland Indians, is an unusual venue for a great comedic gathering.  But iy surely worked this time.  The follow up movie wasn't nearly as good, because I think everyone involved with the first one was surprised that it was so darned good. I am not a sports fan, so I really didn't want to watch a \\"baseball\\" movie, but I was \\"persuaded\\" to give it a try, and lo and behold, I LOVED it.
B003LXSY60|5.0|This album is awesome. Great bluesy tracks throughout the entire album.  Very raw, gritty, grimy, just incredible.  I love these guys music, especially when they are as bold as they are on this album.  Ten Cent Pistol is my favorite song, which isn't as bluesy as the rest of the album, but this is great stuff to listen to.  Let them open the door to let your sorrow slip away.
B001QOGYBI|2.0|I can understand why the movie was not a box office success.  A lot of hype is given to the technology that created the movie - which is considerable.  However, the movie itself was not good.  It really didn't appeal to children or adults - maybe teens would like it.
B003UYUQZW|5.0|I just saw this movie and I loved it! Has everything from action,comedy and a bit of romance. I love that Dastan, even though he is not of noble blood, still receives love and trust from his brothers, who are of noble blood. It is nice to see a movie where there isn't any jealousy amongst brothers to get to the throne. There is just competition to see who's more macho than the other..a guy thing. I loved the story, the action and costumes are great. This is a movie that you will want to watch more than once so just buy the DVD! Trust me! Great movie to add to your movie collection.<br /><br />P.S. And the Princes of Persia...all hot looking actors! Eye candy for the ladies..lol
B002ZG981E|5.0|I saw this movie in IMAX and I was completely and utterly awed by the plot, concept and technology used in it.  I can't wait until it comes out on DVD Blueray and I think that it would of completely altered the state in which we think if it was in 3D.  This movie has GOT to win some Oscars when it comes time, if you like Leonardo DiCaprio and if you like Christopher Nolan than you will love this movie.  It's amazing to see something from Nolan's mind come to life and to see it is to experience it.

B002ZG98UA|3.0|It's Milla again - with Milla, Milla, Milla, and a few others, at least at the start. That's when the Millas invade the stronghold of Evil Corp, originators of the zombie virus, and reduce the property value quite abruptly. That's also when we meet Wesker, the over-the-top Chief Evil Overlord (CEO) of the mad scientists' club.<br /><br />Pretty soon, we're down to just one Milla and the movie gets under way. She finds a former co-survivor, whose memory has been scraped down by mysterious drugs - administered by a robotic scarab that seems sure to become a popular fashion accessory. She connects with one of the small bands of uninfected, and sets out in search of a haven promised by a mysterious radio transmission. She mows down zombies, loses colleagues in a classic countdown, mows down more zombies, saves the innocent, mows down more zombies, battles her nemesis, and braces us for yet another sequel. BTW, the nemesis wants to consume her flesh to make him strong, and the manner of superstitious primitives everywhere (with or without lab coats).<br /><br />The 3D part works well, especially in a few scenes that already had a hefty splatter factor. For whatever it's worth, Milla keeps her clothes on in this one - a pity, since she wears very little very well.<br /><br />This is a sequel to a sequel to a movie derived from a video game. Set your expectations accordingly end enjoy the ride.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters
0553805371|4.0|It has always been a delight to read Hawking's books and his latest book was no exception. That being said, I have a few objections.    1. Model dependent realism is a vestige of the long refuted epistemology of logical positivism which, sadly, Hawking still adheres to.     2. Hawking uses the word \\"nothing\\" in a way that misrepresents the definition of true nothingness. When I say that there is nothing, I mean to convey not simply that there is no solid matter, but that there is no matter, energy, or space-time. In reality Hawking does not believe that the universe came \\"from nothing\\" but rather that the universe never began to exist while still being temporally finite, as allowed by his no-boundary proposal.     3. It would seem that M-theory is untestable, not because it doesn't predict anything, but precisely because it predicts too much. According to Hawking there are 10^500 universes out there, each with their own laws and constants. How then could we ever go about verifying such a fantastic claim? What technology exists, or even could exist in principle, that could demonstrate that 10^500 universes exist? I shall say however, that I might be too presumptuous on this last point. Perhaps in the distant future we could test such a theory. With that caution aside, it seems rather odd that Hawking should choose M-theory as his weapon of choice to attack belief in a prime mover. The no-boundary proposal has done more, in my opinion, to oppose such a belief. Quintin Smith for instance has developed an argument using the no-boundary proposal that there is no creator of the universe.    When recommending this book to other people I have given them these three cautions. Once one bears these in mind Hawking's new book is enjoyable, as is to be expected of such a great mind.
B00005R8FI|5.0|I bought this album based on Amazon reviews. It is a good album that grows on you to become great. The drumless rhythm of the bass is superb while the guitar playing complements the sax to neatly frame Mayall's vocals and harp. All-in-all a sublime experience, albeit hard to categorize. This album will make blues purists uncomfortable but it extends the listener into new areas that can only help define the riches that blues have left us in other genres.
0307454541|3.0|I couldn't put it down because of the fact that I wanted to confirm my suspiscions on who done it! & I knew EXACTLY who had done it from the git go...(yer gut reaction hits you hard when it's read...) Particularly when you go back & remember when Ollie Stone had you sittin' on a park bench, in DC with Mr. X & wonderin' who shot Kennedy, \\"Who benefited? Who has the power to cover it up? Who?\\" & VIOLA You know EXACTLY who did it...likewise, I kept postin' on my FB page where I'd been in the story & it sounded just like a soap opera...& aside from the facts & tid bits o' knowledge in the book, that's exactly what this book is...I'm hopin' there's a better story in the next book I read o' Mr. Larsson's...if not, I'll pass on buyin' the thrid book.
0312600844|5.0|What's the big reason to get excited about this book?<br /><br />It's not the plot. Not the writing.<br /><br />It's the people. Men and women we come to know and care about, not because they're so admirable but because they're so real.<br /><br />Like Patty Berglund, a former college basketball star, now a stay-at-home mom. In her slowly gentrifying neighborhood in St. Paul, Minnesota, she was, Franzen writes, \\"already fully the thing that was just starting to happen to the rest of the street.\\" That is: \\"a morning of baby-encumbered errands, an afternoon of public radio, the Silver Palate Cookbook, cloth diapers, drywall compound and latex paint, and then Goodnight Moon, then zinfandel.\\" The questions that plagued her: \\"Where to recycle batteries? ... How elaborate did a kitchen water filter need to be? ...Could coffee beans be ground the night before you used them, or did this have to be done in the morning?\\"<br /><br />Like Walter Berglund, her husband. Son of a man who owned a small motel in Hibbing --- yes, that Hibbing, where Bob Zimmerman grew up and dreamed himself into Bob Dylan --- he was the very nice guy you never really knew in college because he was studying so hard and working his way through school. He'd met Patty there and knew she was The One, and waited for her to know it. And when she said yes, and shared that her dream was motherhood, he shelved every exalted ambition to get a job in Corporate Communications at 3M. When we meet him, he's the executive director of Minnesota's Nature Conservancy, having trouble with his teen-aged son, about to move to Washington for a new job --- he'll sell his St. Paul house \\"near the bottom of the post-9/11 slump.\\"<br /><br />One more character drives this novel, Walter's college roommate and unlikely best friend. Richard Katz is the leader of nihilistic rock bands, and he's made for the part: talk, dark and arrogant, deadly attractive to women and eager to exploit that attraction. You don't want the truth served up with nasty spin? Keep away from Richard.<br /><br />Patty keeps away. Not because she dislikes Richard --- she craves him. But she's made her choice: a man who will do anything to create a home with her. Hot sex? It passes. It has to. Except that....<br /><br />This is Fiction 101: Building Characters, and if you're surprised how hard it grabs you, it's because today's most acclaimed fiction is too \\"literary\\" to care more about people than language or structure or the next definition of fiction. Franzen, like Balzac and Dickens, is a journalist at heart --- what he's created in \\"Freedom\\" is this generation's \\"Bonfire of the Vanities.\\"<br /><br />The mark of this kind of novel is not only that it feels true but that it becomes true. There's a sequence here about American profiteering during the early days of the Iraq War that's excruciating in its account of American officials who didn't give a damn. Now, as the war \\"ends, recent articles remind us of billions lost and unaccounted for. These crimes, for the government, are consigned to a memory hole. But there's no lack of accountability here. Not on Franzen's watch.<br /><br />Look anywhere in this novel, and you'll see how it defines our time. Like that bird on the cover. It's not decorative. It's going to have its own preserve in West Virginia, courtesy of a billionaire who will, in exchange for a few protected acres, get to blow up mountains and harvest coal. And just as we're reading this, here is Jane Mayer's revelatory New Yorker profile of David and Charles Koch, the billionaires whose companies pollute and despoil while David gives hundreds of millions to Lincoln Center, the American Museum of Natural History, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.<br /><br />Let's consider the title. Franzen's characters are not like the Koch brothers or the coal magnate or the Iraq fraudsters. They are the victims of these people; they live in an America where we make our biggest choices as shoppers. It's a dreary, uglyculture. Even Walter --- staid Walter --- comes to make a surprising indictment: \\"As long as you've got your six-foot-wide-plasma TV and the electricity to run it, you don't have to think about any of the ugly consequences. You can watch 'Survivor: Indonesia' till there's no more Indonesia!\\"<br /><br />The personal quarrels? Just as lacerating. I can't imagine having a fight with my wife as ugly as the ones in these pages. But they're not set-pieces. They're the intimate moments of people whose conflicts, though maybe not ours, are recognizable to us. And when those fights end, sometimes there is clarity, even beauty:<br /><br />\\"She cried then, torrentially, and he lay down with her. Fighting had become their portal to sex, almost the only way it ever happened anymore. While the rain lashed and the sky flashed, he tried to fill her with self-worth and desire, tried to convey how much he needed her to be the person he could bury his cares in. It never quite worked, and yet, when they were done, there came a stretch of minutes in which they lay in the quiet majesty of long marriage, forgot themselves in shared sadness and forgiveness for everything they'd inflicted on each other, and rested.\\"<br /><br />\\"The quiet majesty of long marriage\\" --- that phrase stopped me cold and led me back to the ultimate subject of this book, which is, I think, the challenge of building a functional romantic partnership when you're carrying the legacy of your flawed family and your country's dishonest and exploitative culture. Again, I suspect this challenge isn't unique to Patty and Walter Berglund. It's mine, for sure. And, just maybe, yours.<br /><br />And that is why the end is so devastating. It's richly symbolic --- and, for once, the symbol works. It sets our fond hopes against our hard realities. It reminds us of the limits of our personal power. It redefines what \\"freedom\\" is for people like us, in a time like this. And it suggests, after our big dreams have been crushed, that we may still make smaller dreams come true.<br /><br />I wish I could be more specific, but that would spoil your experience of \\"Freedom.\\" Let me just say that the end is everything you want from a great book --- it's not rushed or tacked on or phony or commercial or cynical. It's at once heartbreaking and inspiring, and it makes you both elated and very, very sad. But, most of all, it immortalizes Patty and Walter and confirms what you are, by then, already feeling --- these imaginary people are in your heart, the way your closest friends are.nt: \\"As long as you've got your six-foot-wide-plasma TV and the electricity to run it, you don't have to think about any of the ugly consequences.

0316098337|5.0|Seven years ago when Ma was a nineteen years old college student and Jack was minus years old, she was kidnapped by Old Nick.  Jack went to bed in the wardrobe as a four years old child but has awakened magically as a five years old boy.  The wardrobe is his safe zone inside the Room that has been his entire world since he came into being.  It is the wardrobe of their soundproof cell that his ingenious mom places him in when Old Nick comes to see her.<br /><br />Whereas Room is Jack's home and world; Room is his Ma's jail cell.  Ma has invented a place for her beloved son to flourish, but she realizes he (and she needs) more.  The time has come for her and her brave child to escape, but Ma is not ready for what awaits them on the outside if they succeed; her goal as it has been for seven years remains liberty from Old Nick.<br /><br />This incredible thriller will hook the audience from the beginning as young innocent Jack tells the tale of his and his Ma's life.  Character driven with a strong sense of pending doom whether they escape or not, few novels told by children since perhaps The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold will match the intensity readers will feel as naïve even for a five years old child Jack tells his saga.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
0937381888|4.0|It's a comprehensive introduction, and pretty well organized on the whole.  In other words, the order of the chapters and sections is logically presented and ordered.      The only suggestion I would have is to make the presentation more text-book like.  Although the material is organized overall, the individual explanations of topics could be more logically and simplistically presented.      For example, the section on converting grain bills to batch and no-sparge methods looked like to was copied and pasted out of a research paper with little attempt to explain the numerical analysis going on there.    Equations and conversions could be presented with greater rigor as to their overall order and relation.  But overall this is very, very good and will teach you quite a bit.
B003O86MY8|4.0|i enjoy this cd, as it's a fun blend of classic and rock and that is whast originally attracted me to it.  but have found that i have quickly tired of it, highly unusualy for me as i enjoy music of all kinds.  and surprising to me, it is the ROCK aspects of his performances that i have tired of.  they seem too repetitive.  quite an unexpected outcome.  i don't know of any other way that i would have come to this conclusion, tho, without having purchased the product and experienced it myself.  I know many others disagree with me and that's fine.  this is just my honest candor of my experience.
B002MBAJ4M|4.0|Gov't Mule is one of the best live bands you will ever see.  Warren Haynes is unbelievable as a musician.  As a songwriter, he is good but not spectacular.  Hence, G Mule studio albums are not on par with their live shows or live albums.     This album is worth owning, and will be no surprise to fans of the band.  To me, Dose was their best studio album, and ever since the albums have all been strong but never stellar.  This one is the same.  I feel like some of the songs could have been left off (like from song 9 on).  Maybe it's just because by that point you've been listening to the album for an hour and it's enough already, but the quality of the last few songs seems to be a big drop off.
0307276902|1.0|The last thing I wanted to do was give this book only one star. When I first read it, as a recovering alcoholic myself, I couldn't put it down. Frey's honesty about the painful emotions that one goes through during the first months of sobriety were extremely close to my own experiences. The \\"fury\\" that Frey describes was a wonderful depiction of how hard it is to deal with feelings once the blanket of alcohol is taken away.<br /><br />However...<br /><br />Frey's description of the treatment he received at Hazelden is wildly inaccurate. Anyone who has been to that facility would throw up a red flag after reading the first few chapters of the book. What I hated most was Frey's \\"relationship\\" with Lilly, a female patient at Hazelden. First of all, I'm positive that Lilly was just another fictional character out of Frey's imagination. Frey has insisted that Lilly was a real person, but strangely, he hasn't backed up his claims with any documentation. Second, Hazelden is incredibly strict about male/female patient relationships. Frey would never have been able to get away with seeing Lilly, and the incident involving Lilly at the crackhouse made me laugh out loud. There isn't a chance that any counselor at Hazelden would even entertain the thought of driving Frey into the Twin Cities to \\"rescue\\" her.<br /><br />Frey had an opportunity to use his captivating writing style to craft a truly memorable book about addiction. Instead, he made those of us who bought his book look like fools. Did Frey really think he could get away with \\"a million little lies\\"? He should be ashamed.
B00267N3DQ|5.0|When I got this DVD combo pack, I was impressed by the cover and the packaging. I watched the Blu-Ray in my room the day after. For those of you confused about the Blu-Ray and DVD combo packs, this is how it works. Blu-Ray combos involve the small, blue package with the DVD behind the Blu-Ray discs. The DVD combo has the Black edged packaging with the DVD in front of the Blu-Ray discs. I liked the DVD combo better because of it's nice cover and grip. If you want it in Hd, buy the DVD combo pack.

B002JVWRAO|4.0|There's something a little bit off this season---maybe the temporary separation between the brothers, the muddled mess of the angels and God and the demons and Lucifer, having to see Bobby in a wheelchair most of the time, or seeing some old friends come to an explosive end.<br /><br />Still, there is plenty to enjoy here. The episode where the trickster sends the guys into a TV universe is not to be missed. And it's great watching Paris Hilton's head get cut off in the \\"Fallen Idols\\" episode.<br /><br />Castiel and Zachariah are also back for more action, and Mark Pellegrino is a great choice to play Lucifer.<br /><br />Great gag reel as always, too.

B003EV6DBM|2.0|With Series Five, at least for our family, Saturday nights were set aside for watching Doctor Who. However, as the season progressed, we found ourselves actually forgetting to watch. The stories were just not intriguing enough to keep us interested.<br /><br />As for Matt Smith, I loved him. He is cute and reminiscent of Tom Baker enough to engender a love of him in the role. However, while Karen is a good actor, I did not care for her character at all and I especially hated her too short mini skirts.<br /><br />All in all, I think I will purchase a couple of the Tom Baker episodes rather than the Fith Series. Hopefully, the next season will be an improvement.
0061714372|5.0|This book is great and thoroughly explains Dave Mustaine's life. Great read for any dedicated fan.
0316010669|3.0|Blink deals with our innate capability to make snap judgments in the blink of an eye. Malcolm Gladwell strives to address three broad themes in this yet another masterpiece. He lays out that snap judgments could be every bit as good as ones taken after prolonged deliberation. He then states that we need to know when to trust such instincts and when we must be wary of them. Lastly, he states that the the human mind can indeed be trained to control and enable rapid cognition.<br /><br />What follows is a deep-dive into the way human beings judge situations and come to instant conclusions. It turns out that we are all experts at 'thin slicing' - an ability to find patterns based on choosing specific experiences & filtering out the rest. And as we are thin slicing, our subconscious mind does guide us towards a conclusion. To prove this point, Gladwell takes us through the world of art experts (who, at a moment's observation identify a fake), a marriage analyst (who, upon looking at perceptible facial expressions & hearing conversations determines the strength of a marriage) and medical malpractice lawyers (who can hear snippets of a doctor's conversation with his patient and conclude his risk of being sued). As you go through such examples, you marvel at his ability in marshaling his points and presenting them in such a manner that you can actually relate to them.<br /><br />But how do we sift the meaningless slices from the important ones? Gladwell states that slicing based on physical attributes, stature and stereotypes are best avoided. In other words, you change the way you thin slice. And, it would help to reasonably limit the options/choices that you use to arrive at a conclusion.<br /><br />While the first two objectives of the book are well structured, it is the third aspect that the book lacks, viz. how can the human mind be trained. The reader is only advised that he must 'practice'; the examples mentioned thereafter are on how repeated mind reading enabled under less pressure could lead to reduction in accidental police fatalities. While I wholeheartedly agree that practice makes perfect, I definitely would have liked better examples. Or may be, there is no better example than sustained experience?<br /><br />Regardless, this is yet another brilliant book from one of the world's most original thinkers. The next time you come to a conclusion in the blink of an eye, try to ascertain what you did. You may be surprised by what you find.lead to reduction in accidental police fatalities.

B002GY9F9K|3.0|I loved the entire Sword of Truth series of books and was delighted when I saw that there was a TV show. When I ordered he first season on DVD I was not expecting a fantasy series that was so loosly, and I mean loosly, based on Wizard's First Rule.    As a television series it is wonderful as long as you are not expecting it to follow the Terry Goodkind books. The characters were well chosen, but none of them follow the books at all. The storyline does not even start off the same as the books, and the bits and pieces being used from the books do not help any.    I think the actor who was chosen to play Zedd was one of the few good things about the series, everything else was pretty bad. Even the Darken Rahl character was terribile, the producers did not even try to find somebody who looked and acted like the character in the book.    The Mord Sith were also well done in this series, but like everything else nothing of the book based story appears. Richard was tortured badly in the book and was a long, drawn out process spanning weeks; in the TV series it lasts only hours.    So basically you will either love the books and hate the TV series, or vice versa.

B000ESST6U|5.0|This production of Handel's 'Giulio Cesare' was a box-office and critical triumph at the Glyndebourne Festival, as it well deserved to be. I'll get to the music later, but first let me rave about the theatrical staging It's 305 minutes of spellbinding Entertainment! It has everything: pathos and passion, wit, visual splendor, a seductive Cleopatra voluptuous enough to be plausible as the most beautiful woman in history, Vegas-worthy strutting and dancing, well choreographed swordplay, outrageous gender-nuanced camp humor, a beefcake acrobat, an onstage fiddler, and marvelous acting by all the principals. This is not the stand-and-belt stereotypical opera of the Age of Divasaurs and Pachytenors. This is Baroque opera in full crowd-rousing mode, as Handel's original 1724 production must have been, since that production was also a box-office success, revived in 1725, 1730, and 1732, and also staged in Paris, Hamburg, and Brunswick. If all of Handel's operas had been as well-attended as 'Giulio Cesare', odds are that he could have remained true to his First Love - Italian Opera - and not have been forced to compose music for pious pastiches by Charles Jennons in the barbarous English tongue.<br /><br />The love affair of Caesar and Cleopatra has been transported from imperial Roman times to a setting in the British Raj, circa 1910, with the Roman legions in redcoat regimentals and the subservient locals in costumes that blend Egypt and Punjab. It's a concept that works well for me, apt historically and dramatically, considering that Handel wrote for an audience of rising Brrrritish world-conquerers. One would not have seen togas on a baroque opera stage in 1724, I hope everyone realizes. This is a modernizing production -- \\"Eurotrash\\" for some hide-bound conservatives-- that truly expands and enhances the 'content' of the libretto and the music.<br /><br />Caesar, sung by soprano Sarah Connolly, is a foppish, starchy gentleman/officer -- a character straight from the pages of a Harry Flashman novel. He's a bit of a poof, yet calmly secure in his Sahib mastery and brave as a schoolboy on the fields of Eton. Connolly manages to look quite masculine in an epicene upper-class fashion, and she sings gloriously. The role of Caesar has the widest diversity of musical affects, from military bravura to love-torn rapture to birdsong glee. Connolly renders them all, eventually with apomb enough to make even a 'soprano' Caesar quite a dominant, heroic presence.<br /><br />Ptolmey is sung by countertenor Christophe Dumaux; he's an odious, corrupt, cruel slimebag, this descendent of Alexander's general, and Dumaux makes him effectively creepy. His right-had villain, Achilla, is sung by baritone Christopher Maltman, the only non-trebel voice in the cast. Maltman is a skillful foil, musically, to all those high voices, and he acts his tough-guy role convincingly.<br /><br />Cornelia, the widow of murdered Pompey the Great, is sung by alto Patricia Bardon, while her impetuous son Sextus is sung superbly and acted powerfully by soprano Angelika Kirschschlager. Their troubles at the hands of Ptolmey and Achilla form a sub plot almost as compelling as the 'hooking up' of Caesar and Cleopatra, and their duet in the first act is one of the pinnacles of Handel's composition. It's also a sterling example of stage director David McVicar's witty attention to detail; mother and son sing their poignant duet in the posture of a Michelangelo Pieta. They're so good vocally, especially Kirschschlager, that they'd steal the show if the other principals weren't equally good. Kirschschlager has the finest voice per se, the finest physical instrument, of the cast.<br /><br />But the show-stealer, as the recorded enthusiasm of the audience proves, is Danielle de Niese in the role of Cleopatra. De Niese is gorgeous, as beautiful of face and form as the actress Halle Berry, whom she resembles. She also vivacious, sexy, agile; she dances and prances as well as any hoofer in a Broadway musical, and she can convey anguish, despair, or anger just as well as allure. It's an odd phenomenon, which you can see in the reviews of d Niese's Handel showcase CD, that her rapid success and/or her physical charms seem to provoke some people into ridiculous diatribes -- one-star reviews --about her vocal technique. \\"She's no Beverly Sills\\" they howl. Well, thank goodness! Sills completely lacked the historically-informed vocal technique to sing Handel. De Niese does not have a voice per se of the quality of Kirschschlager's, but then neither does Sarah Connolly, Both of them amply compensate by their control of their voices, that is, by their polished baroque technique. De Niese has three major virtues: She has excellent tuning, something that Kathleen Battle, for instance, never learned. She makes expressive use of her control of dynamics, something Cecilia Bartoli or Renee Fleming often fail to do. And she deeply understands baroque ornamentation, her graces, trills, and cadences are always 'integrated' into her phrasings, making musical sense of a sort that Joan Sutherland or even the sublime Janet Baker never approached. To denigrate her singing as 'technically undeveloped' is bizarre. One make think she was running for Congress against a darling of the Tea Party blatherskates.<br /><br />Music? Oh yeah, this IS an opera, not just a stage spectacular. 'Giulio Cesare' is a ravishing score, still composed in the style of Handel's Roman cantatas, calling for flamboyant vocal virtuosity. I can hardly imagine a more perfect cast for it than Connolly, Kirschschlager, Bardon, and d Niese. The orchestral writing is equally flamboyant, with colorful obbligatos for flutes and natural horns. Conductor Bill Christie brings out the elegance and complexity of the score without any twitch of academicism. In fact, he lets the music and the instruments be playful. He doesn't need to be cautious; the musicians of the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment handle their 'period instruments' as skillfully as any opera orchestra of 20th C instruments in the world. And if you still cling to the troglodytic notion that Baroque instruments lack the richness or power of modern, just listen closely. You'll be disabused.<br /><br />Fortunately, the sound recording is equal to the quality of the musical performance. Voices and orchestra are well in balance, equally 'present'. The camera work is also first rate, a good mix of long shots and close-ups, with good editing, nothing distracting or overdone, totally supportive of the singing and acting. This is a magnificent DVD, one of the most excellent filmings of an opera I've ever watched and heard.onvey anguish, despair, or anger just as well as allure.

Granted, now my eyes feel like the scratchpatch at the local semi-precious stone shop.  Probably because I couldn't put the book down to go and fetch my glasses.  The plot was complex, well-thought out and constructed.  It gripped you completely.  And the ending????  What was that?  Now I just have to get the third one in the trilogy and find out what happens!  Another weekend stuffed because of Mr Sieg Larsson!

1594488843|5.0|Dan Pink's book has been dancing through my head for nearly a year, and his well-researched and passionately delivered insights challenge conventional wisdom about earlier theories on motivation. Most of what you do with your colleagues, clients, boss or kids requires motivation, and Pink's perspective will give you new ways to excite yourself and others... and help you understand why some pervasive \\"common-sense\\" approaches are ineffective. I've probably told 50 people about this book, and I hope to see corporations in America rethink the old \\"carrot and stick\\" method, and light the fire within.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Going into this book, I already knew that it was not a Happily Ever After type of book.  Anyone who has read the first 2 books should know that.  Yes it was depressing, but I knew it would be. Who really thought that Katniss was going to end the book as a sweet, innocent child. Her and the other characters became their environment.  They adapted to it. I thought this was an amazing series.  The third book was so good I can not put it down.  I am a 34 year old mother of three and I have read hundreds of books, and this series has stayed with me. I have actually gone back and read certain sections over again.  So anyone out there that is on the fence about this series due to reviews of the third book, hop on over...it is so worth it.

0374158460|1.0|'I'd call him a sadistic, hippophilic (lover of horses) necrophile, but that would be beating a dead horse' (Woody Allen)    Applied to Jonathan Franzen, and to his acolytes, this means that 'Freedom' is a reflection of the pathetic literary sophistication of the American public.     I suggest those who don't share my lack of acknowledgment of the Author's writing skill (his inability to quench his adolescent self-indulgence and, of most import, his use of common language to undermine the very essence of fiction) read B. R. Myers's review in The Atlantic.    I do not recognize Franzen's characters, the devices (the 'autobiography' in particular) fail as distinguishing elements or voices, and the tone as a hectoring screed is childish (my political stance aligns in something approximating lockstep with Franzen).       I could go on but it's simply not worth it.
0765326353|4.0|This is an excellent book and a great start to what promises to be a very entertaining series. The characters are all interesting, and the magic system is unique and makes for awesome action sequences.  One of the great things about this book is that the main characters all have something interesting about them. Without going into spoilers, let's just say that no one is the bumbling hero that gets lucky to survive and happens to be in the right place at the right time.    The only thing holding this back from a 5-star review is that the book is a little too self-conscious that it's the first in a long series. Several backstories and flashbacks go on a little longer than necessary, and a couple of the main plots seem to drag a bit towards the beginning/middle. It's the type of thing where you know where the story is headed, and the hero needs to overcome X obstacle to get there, but I think Sanderson just put 1 too many obstacles and dragged out the affair a little longer than necessary.    That said, the last 120 pages of this book were phenomenal. The setup for the next book is excellent and makes the wait pretty awful. The main characters at the end of the book are all right where you want them to be.  They've overcome whatever personal issue or obstacle they had, and that clears the way for them to truly start to do the important work that will soon need to be done (as heavily foreshadowed). There aren't really any cheap cliffhangers, which is nice, but the main storyline is just barely being exposed in this first book. There is a LOT left to be explained and explored, and I'm looking forward to all of it.

B002Y0KR84|4.0|More than dated special effects, but light fanciful story that was entertaining to 10 year old grandson as well as 62 year old grandfather.  Nice to have in travel collection.
B00005MNP7|5.0|Blondie follows Parallel Lines with another LP chock full of incredible songs in the form of \\"Eat to the Beat\\".  Rolling Stone gives Blondie an obligatory entry in their \\"500 Greatest Albums Of All Time\\" with Parallel Lines.  \\"Eat to the Beat\\" clearly belongs on that list along with three other titles (Debut, AutoAmerican and No Exit). The extra tracks, again, are fantastic and only add to this powerful effort.  A true must have!!!!
6305291446|4.0|After Halloween launched in 1978 the new horror genre exploded. Scary, spooky, suspense and slasher all came into play at a rapid pace.<br /><br />The Halloween series was right there...sequel after sequel.H20 begins at a posh and secluded private school for teens. Jamie Lee Curtis continues her role with an alias (since she has faked her death to throw off Michael Myers). LLCoolJ is a perfect security guard....just the right touch.<br /><br />I think Halloween only needs one sequel...Halloween H20. In a nutshell, this wraps the story neat and tidy. If you only see these two movies, you will have the story.
B002NZK5TG|5.0|Perfect condition! A true American classic hat is also on a short list of acceptable musicals (such as The Producers and Sweeney Todd). On top of an amazin movie it includes several hilarious guest star appearances.
0060899190|5.0|We are starting a reading inititive at the high school where I teach.  I love these books and want to share them with my students.  I have 2 other books, and I would like to know if this is appropriate for a high school.  The two I have can be sexually graphic and therefore, I don't feel comfortable bringing it into my classroom.    Anyone?    Thanks!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I love this show!  I laugh out loud at least twice during every episode.
B002FOQXZK|5.0|I downloaded this randomly-- I remember liking Day&Night; Well I was listening to it today and I'm blown away. It suits my personality to the T. He seems to have been through a lot of things that I can relate to, like his father dying (mine died when I was 6) and things about the expansion of the mind, so forth and so on. The music is intelligent and the beats are balanced with piano, violin, beats, and melodies. Loving this one!
B00355L2TU|4.0|Very effective.  This is by far one of the best home video workouts I've done. It's very short and very challenging (runs a total of 30 mins i believe).  I am in good shape so I choose the harder versions of the exercises.  I was dying by the end of the workout. I would suggest chosing lighter weights first time around and go heavier as you feel more comfortable.  Jillian doesn't suggest how much lb. weights to use for the strength exercises.  This was sort of hard to gage.

B003ITZBVI|5.0|Batman has gone through so many different forms in the past, but I'm so happy to see DC finally giving us a dark and brooding Batman.  This movie is amazing and should really be enjoyed on Blu-ray.  Many people think that something animated can't possibly look better on HD, but they are wrong.  Movie takes place with Batman suffering a great loss at the hand of the joker, and having to deal with that loss through the movie.  Nightwing  (the original robin) is in full form and really adds something nice to this show.      For those who figure they'll just rent this...trust me, if your a Batman fan, or just a fan of really good story telling and animation, then you'll be purchasing this movie.
0307454541|1.0|This book is horribly written.  Lisbeth Salander is somewhat interesting but the author never really gives you a reason to like any of these characters.  Blomkvist has no depth.  He is basically a womanizer, and for some reason he is irresistable to all the female characters, but you never understand why. The author tries to shock you with sex, violence, and the abuse of women by men who have power over them.  Is it the shock value that made this book a bestseller?  It's definitley not the writing so that must be it.  Overall a lousy book.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|I really never watched Lost when it was on TV, but after the series was over, I saw that I could get the complete series on Blu-ray for a reasonable price and figures...what the heck.  First let me say that the packaging is very impressive and I've never seen a collection packaged like this.  Fans of the show will find a great deal of nostalgia with what's given here, and new-comers to the series will really feel like they've gotten their moneys worth.    For those who are still unsure if this series is for them, let me give you a little tip.  Put aside the fact that there will be many characters on this show that seem very one dimensional, and will have the same extact conflicts on every episode.  I could list the names of character I don't particularly like, but I'll leave that to you, but remember that the journey isn't just about them, it's more about the island, and figuring out what's really going on there.  Yes you'll probably get tired of Jack after a while, but don't let a little poor writing get in the way of a good long tale ;)
B0019EXZY4|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It had a little of everything. Fast moving, suspense and a good ending
081297381X|1.0|Mr Taleb is trying to become a self proclaimed philosopher by over writing himself into irrelevant, overdescribed and in many cases contradictory arguments.<br /><br />I failed to learn anything from his story that Dr Yossi Vardi asked him to recite something on one leg after he had a few great glasses of wine in Munich. I have no idea if Mr Taleb could do it without the wine! I did understand that he is telling us that he is part of a world jet-set of money making people.<br /><br />He is full of negative criticism about too many issues, in many cases he does not even bother to analyze and convince the reader of his criticism like in the case of Sydney (Australia) Opera. Maybe there were objective reasons for the construction delay? Maybe corruption, an earth quake? Nothing - just point blank \\"you are nothing\\"<br /><br />Mr. Taleb asks \\"stupid questions and gets stupid answers\\". He is forcing his listeners in a London seminar to guess how many books are there in Umberto Eco's library. Unless it is a matter of life and death - just go count them...I saw no relevance between irrelevant questions and the appearance of a black swan (unless Mr. Taleb thinks companies are run by guess work).<br /><br />For me this book only taught me about Mr. Taleb's hidden frustrations and implications on his ego. Mr. Taleb preaches to detach oneself from the environment, news, etc. yet; this environment provides him the audience for him to show how he takes a simple matter and complicates it.<br /><br />The fact that we have to expect the unexpected, to prepare for the next war, not the last one - is very well known. No one needs to waste valuable time (and money) to pamper Mr. Taleb's ego.<br /><br />The core ideas of this book could have been summarized in 30 pages.<br /><br />A great disappointment. My copy is up for sale.

0812973992|5.0|A huge novel full of life and love. The characters are inter-related in often surprising ways and the sense of New York is exuberant. It was hard to put it down and when I'd finished it I felt that I could read it again and find more.

B003FSTN6Q|4.0|Yes this season took a turn in a toally different direction. It does not mean that this season sucked though. The beginning of the season through everyone for a loop with five years missing and her having a child and adopting a new concept with the shinies. It still had you going and it still kept the love, caring and mystery the show always had. Should they of slowed down a bit yes but they didn't and unfortunately people stopped watching (not me) and they are canceled... very sad and I hope it comes back sometime. Still worth seeing if you are a true Ghsot Whisperer fan. One mistake shouldn't of ended this at all.

B002SJIO5E|4.0|The story idea of this movie is brilliant!However District 9 starts with Movie #2. I wish they had started the series like this:    Movie #1: Title to be announced. The alien space ship with mechanical problems comes to rest over Johannesburg, S. Africa. There is no response from the mother ship for months and finally, Earthlings must break into it to find emaciated \\"prawn\\" space people.They are given the status of immigrants and placed in detention camps and are prone to gangs and crime...just like us. Where did they come from and why? This would be explained in Movie #1.    Movie #2: The current District 9 which has left itself open for a sequel. Van De Mer Wer (sic?) has to wait 3 years for his prawn friend Christopher to bring the big ship back to change Van De Mer Wer back to human.    Movie #3: District 10. In the meantime, what has happened to the human who is turning into a prawn? Did he completely become one and see the follies of humanity and decide to go back to the prawn's planet? Or did he decide to go back to human if Christopher saved him?    Perhaps they can pull a \\"Star Wars\\" thing where the prequel is made after the sequels. Such a great and original idea! Don't waste it!
B003EYVXYG|5.0|I have been awaiting this movie's release for over two years and it was well worth the wait. The special features were great and the audio commentaries were very informative. Now I can't wait until George releases his next film.
6301972139|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Jose Ferrer does an excellent job, as do all cast members. This movie shows the life and inspirations of Henri Toulouse Lautrec from childhood on, showing Paris in all it's many colorful facets.    Tres Magnifique!

B00005JLPK|5.0|This is the BEST movie about an artist that I've ever seen and true to her life story.  The film is a masterful art work in itelf and must be seen to be appreciated.  Salma was perfect.<br /><br />**HIGHLY RECOMMEND *, Ages 16+
044654759X|4.0|I've read all of Nicholas's books and will continue to BUT this book is SO much like \\"Sleeping with Enemy\\" with a bit of \\"Sixth Sense\\" at the end. From Katie running away on a bus, going to a small town, sprucing up an old house, closing her self off from the man she will fall in love with, going to a carnival where her husband finds her and then and even how Katie's husband leaves is \\"Sleeping with the Enemy\\". Good book, quick read but a bummer because I saw it in a movie years ago.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|All I can say is, if you love Beatrix and her books, you MUST see this movie. Lovely, poignant and inspirational.  Renee does English better than the English.
B003XK0AX6|3.0|Jensen Ackles was without question the highlight of this animation. He was the only voice acting that was top grade brilliant and I hope he peruses doing VA more. That said the joker didnt work for me. Black mask was annoying. The serious tone and message of this show was lost abit in cheesy hokiness. Something has happened with DC releases past Wonder Woman, GL and PE. Every film is an experiment with big billing actors that dont quite mesh with the super hero they are playing and the scripts while more adult, action packed, and better animated lack the soul of their past counterpart shows. Decent attempt but I really fear there does not seem to be any remote replacements for batman or joker that will do them justice. Mask of the Phantasm and Wonder Woman still rule the roost.
B002UZCJ8Y|3.0|The concept behind this film had a lot of potential, but wasn't as fleshed out as it should have been.  I enjoyed the film and found it entertaining (mostly because of Bruce Willis), but it was short.<br /><br />It was a hoot seeing Ving Rhames in a character you'd never expect to see him in.<br /><br />Good for a rainy afternoon viewing.
0439023513|3.0|This will be obvious to most; as it's a review of the third book, but I was a huge fan of [[ASIN:054531058X The Hunger Games - Library Edition]]. [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]] was less impressive, but still good enough for readers to anxiously await the concluding volume.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0545310601 Mockingjay (The Final Book of The Hunger Games) - Library Edition]] refers to the symbolic role Katniss Everdeen plays in a rebellion against the Capitol. All the districts save one are strongly allied against the central government. This obvious metaphor for a Big Brother state has played host to each of the previous years' hunger games--a youth tournament of death reminiscent of [[ASIN:0451196716 The Long Walk]]. In the third book, Katniss Everdeen shifts from being a feminist protagonist to a morally ambiguous superhero. It is not a graceful transformation, and the prose appears more awkward than in either of Mockingjay's predecessors.<br /><br />The plot remains fast-paced, and picks up dramatically in the second half of the 400-page text. The ending was neither anticlimactic nor stellar. My best estimate is that 60 percent of readers will have guessed the ending well before the epilogue.<br /><br />An issue for some will be Collins' over-reliance on introspection as a literary device. The writing mantra of 'show-don't-tell' never applied more. Stream-of-consciousness is hard to do well--and seems more than this author can give. Never mistake any of the Hunger Games books for literature--they are merely good reads that will satisfy a multi-age audiences around the world.<br /><br />This recommendation is based purely on plot, without taking stock in the caliber of writing. For youth fiction, it is generally satisfactory. If this seems counter-intuitive in a book review, Victor Hugo or Alexandre Dumas are a surer bet. Were it possible, I'd give [[ASIN:0439023513 Mockingjay (The Final Book of The Hunger Games)]] three-and-a-half stars as it is less gripping than the original but superior to [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]].g than the original but superior to [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]].
0767802519|5.0|Something to consider: Luc Besson directed \\"Nikita\\", which became \\"Point of No Return\\" in America. In this film, Jean Reno plays \\"The Cleaner\\", and wears the same sunglasses (this role is played by Harvey Keitel in \\"Point of No Return\\"). He shows up to get rid of two bodies in a mission gone wrong. I wouldn't be surprised if that character is what spawned this movie. Something to think about, at least. This is probably one of the better movies I've ever seen, though the end might make your girlfriend cry. You've been warned.
0240808452|5.0|I don't know about Mr. Mattesi's theory on drawing movement: it looks a bit too esoteric and obscure, and after a while I just stopped reading it, but his drawings are really really good and I learned a lot just observing them. I recommend this book because if you're interested in drawing human body in movement there are lots of tricks and techniques: it may improve your drawings.
0061914177|1.0|I was disappointed and felt misled after purchasing this book. It is by no means a how-to on how to \\"Crush It\\". Gary spends a good portion of the book pumping you up full of sunshine - telling you that now is the time to \\"Crush It\\" - you are left with very little substance to act upon. He basically tells you to use social media and that's it. I know from experience that depending on what you intend to \\"crush\\" not all forms of social media are going to work. Some work better than others depending on your product / service and who you are trying to reach.    To Gary's credit, he figured it out: with a lot of hype you can sell anything. He did it with this book and he sure fooled me. Once a year, I usually go through my library and gather up old books to sell or give away. This one won't even make it to my bookshelf. It's going straight into the sell / donate pile.
B0033TJATW|5.0|I am thrilled to have this video on DVD. I love Michael Jackson! The video came very quickly and packed well. The only issue I have is that the explanation of the movie on the back is not in English and I did not know that ahead of time.  I have no idea what language it is. They are not even letters they are symbols.  However since the movie is completely in English its all good.
B00002DE0S|5.0|While I would never give away my recording of the two Chopin piano concerti by Artur Rubinstein, this interpretaton -- realization? -- by Krystian Zimerman as pianist and conductor has a fresh, rhapsodic quality that reveals much that remains hidden in other recordings.  Zimerman has a subtlety, breadth, and attention to detail that give me the sense of hearing these two works \\"for the first time.\\" It is clear that Zimerman is in love with these two works.  My only complaint -- a major one -- concerns the packaging and price.  The two concerti could easily have fit on a single CD.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|I have not read the books. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and will be reading the books in the near future. This flick is geared towards the younger crowd but adults will like it too.

B003R0LBVW|1.0|My friend told me about this book, so I decided to read the free sample.  It's pretty bad when I can't even finish the sample because it was so boring.

B001AP11KW|5.0|I have been a huge White Stripes fan for years, but was resistant to listening to other Jack White projects. I didn't dig the initial single \\"Rock Steady\\" and thought it was kind of Jack \\"Lite\\". I was wrong. After purchasing the latest Dead Weather CD (which I also love) I decided to give the Raconteurs a shot. I  LOVE  LOVE this album. I love the variety of songs, I love the lyrics, I love that its not White Stripes in anyway. It just shows the genius of these musicians to create so many different and distinct sounds. I am sorry I went so long without this album, and I am jumping on the bandwagon, a few years much too late!
B0039TD7PY|4.0|For JT or C.King fans this is an excellent CD which tries to replicate routine concerts at the Troubadour  Club in LA.  Gives the fans a chance to see the magic of both artist as it played out in the early 70's.  This CD is recorded without the extra instruments and without the background singers that JT would typically  use in a normal concert tour.  The quality however is there and it is easy to see why both artist became  as successful as they did.  A+++++++++++++++.
0312600844|3.0|It's a fine book, a nice book, even a good book. Swell.    I'm re-reading the Rabbit books and Franzen doesn't compare in any way to Updike. In fact, this book makes it clear why Updike was so special. I've just finished the portion of Rabbit Is Rich where Pru has arrived and the family is meeting with the minister to arrange a quick wedding for Nelson. NOTHING in Freedom approaches the exquisiteness of that chapter.    Special issues with Freedom:     The writer of the 'diary' segments has the identical SAME voice as the author of the novel. Those segments use descriptive prose utterly alien to the purported 'source' - a diary. It's manipulative, a device, and it stinks.    Introducing a cardboard character in order to kill her off is similarly offensive.     It's a nice effort by a developing talent. Huzzah. I see nothing that justifies the hype. The book will be forgotten in 2 years and will never be assigned in any literature class.
B003JTHESA|3.0|Good songs good ideas, i have been a fan of maiden for 25 years. These guys can make great  music however this album is full of excessive doodling. All of these songs could have been edited down to half the length, they would have packed way more punch. Less is more, songs don't have to be 10 minutes long. I think Maiden need to record with someone else, some one who will produce an album for the fans not for the bands own egos.
B000VNMMQ6|2.0|I loved all the die hards and was pretty excited about this one. Well that disipated when i saw the overkill computer hacker plot, ludicrous action scenes and basically Bruce being indestructible as ever. Football players that are well trained and full of muscle get hurt all the time, with something as a sprained ankle, but 50+ year old John McClain can out run planes, duck flying cars, jump off buildings, has super healing wounds like wolverine, and lets not forget as he lunges that police car right into that S.W.A.T helicopter. As i said i just did that the other day and WOW it was a blast, i didnt even have to try! So i think you get the point, this was just another dead franchise that takes CGI yet again to a ridiculous level. Give us some films from old schoolers with REAL stunts, REAL explosions, and just an overall feel that they worked very hard on it. The Expendables was 1000 times better and more plausible than this, and it was actually cheesy, and had a better story! So forget this movie, watch Bruce in Tears of The Sun, 16 Blocks, The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, or the old Die Hards. Anything but this stinker, oh yeah i heard the next one will feature John McClain farting and taking out a tank in downtown L.A!! It will be called DIEFART!!Go BRUCE!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|\\"Sigh No More\\" is everything a folk album should be.  Sentimental, tasteful, offensive, and beautiful.      It is hard to not appreciate a good band that allows you to get lost in the music, and Mumford & Sons will grab your attention and take you to a place seldom visited by the artists of today.  The lyrics are thought-provoking, the melodies are catchy- the experience of listening to this album is simply delightful!      Album favorites include \\"The Cave\\", \\"Roll Away Your Stone\\", \\"White Blank Page\\", \\"Little Lion Man\\", and \\"Thistle and Weeds\\".  It is impossible to choose a favorite.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|This movie is about Gandhi's struggle later in his life when one moment motivates him to stand up for what he thinks is right. It takes place in South Africa and jumps through his years there from 1893 to present day. It begins with his death but flashes back to how it all started. He is thrown off a train earlier in his life for being Indian, despite having a ticket to be on there. He realizes the laws in South Africa are biased towards his people so he dedicates himself to non violent protesting of the laws. One arrest after another happen and Gandhi starts to get international attention. When this happens the South African government decides to let Indians have rights. After this victory, Gandhi goes back to India a hero and is asked to try and get India's freedom from Britian. He is of course motivated and sets an international campaign with obsticales along the way. Violence is used against his peaceful protestors, he is arrested a few times, but the situation is like that in South Africa; Britian gets unwanted attention and can't fight back against India so they grant the freedom of the country. This isn't the last of the fighting however; a religious war breaks out between the Hindus and the Muslims in the country. Gandhi goes on a hunger strike saying he will not eat until all the violence is over with. The conclusion of the fighting is to make a seperate country for the Muslims, even though this is not what Gandhi wanted. It then ends where the movie began, with the assassination of Gandhi and then his funeral scene.     This movie is covered with religous aspects. Gandhi was a devout Hindu and wanted only peace through all people and all religion. It is related to my relgions class because we're learning about the Hindus and their peaceful practices. And in my religons textbook Gandhi is a huge part of the history of India and the Hindu religion. Without him India might still be struggling for peace and the fighting might be greater than it was. This movieopened the eyes for people around the world to the life of Gandhi and the leaps he had to make to gain freedom for India and for religion. The movie ends with a quote from Gandhi,   \\"When I despair, I remember that all through history the ways of truth and love have always won. There have been tyrants, and murderers, and for a time they can seem invincible, but in the end they always fall. Think of it--always.\\" This thought was based from a life of peaceful practice and the ways of Hindu. He did so much for India that is he called 'Bapu' or Father, and will be remembered forever for what he did.

B001HNE3NO|2.0|having just finished this book, cringing inside at the juvenile writing style, i checked out customer reviews to see if ANYONE else noticed.  among the vast majority of enchanted readers, i found a few who agreed.  the historical events really need to be told, but not this ineptly.  one of many glaring missteps is the author's overuse of sentence fragments that begin with &#34;and.&#34;  there is the kernel of a good, important story here, but it begs to be told by a better author.
0684135051|5.0|I am a \\"new\\" knitter, and found it interesting--but NOT relaxing. I used to watch my grandma knitting along, talking to me, with the TV on and coming up with beautiful work.How did she do that? Well, this book may just hold the solution. Written in plain, understandable, language, with a touch of humor;I was up most of the night giving it a first read. Illustrations are also clear.  I am anxious to give it a practical test. May be after some time, I might work up to the Norwegian and Sweish sweaters at the end of the book--or a pair of socks?? Strongly recommended,plus the book, order, and delivery were also very good.

B00319ECHE|5.0|I have been listening to Fear Factory for over 10 years now and this album rivals their past excellent albums like Obsolete and Demanufacture. In this album it seems the band pulled out all the stops, was in a place to truly express their art, and put everything they could into the recording and the writing of the album. I know Fear Factory has had some rough times although I don't know much about it. All I can say is I somewhat lost faith in the band after 2005 'Transgression.' The album wasn't bad but wasn't good either. I've never written a review on a Fear Factory album and I've been away from the new stuff from the band for a while. This cd furiously brought me back... It is heavy, progressive, and articulated in the right way to where I was like, \\"Hell yeah!! This is Amazing!!\\" This album is comparable and in some ways better than anything they have done in the past. A solid album worth purchasing.
0385333846|5.0|It's probably been over a decade since I last read Slaughterhouse Five, but after recommending it to a student who's been excitedly reading through it, I got the urge to dive back into Vonnegut's world again. There are few who don't know what Slaughterhouse Five is about, but for the unaware, it's the tale of Billy Pilgrim, a WWII veteran who was present at the fire-bombing of Dresden and now finds himself \\"unstuck\\" in time, catapulting around through his life. Of course, it's also the story of Vonnegut himself, as he deals with his memories of Dresden and tries to find some meaning behind it all. There's so much beauty and honesty in Slaughterhouse Five that it's hard to know where to start. Vonnegut's rambling, train-of-thought style isn't for all tastes, but for those who lose themselves in his world, it allows for marvelous asides and powerful moments, as well as Vonnegut's typically cynical optimism. As much of a contradiction as that sounds, it's the only way I know how to describe Vonnegut's work - there's no doubt that he's deeply cynical about the world and humankind, but he nonetheless hopes for better, hopes for improvement and wishes that people could learn from the past. And there are moments of stunning beauty and hope here - for instance, the quiet and profoundly moving sequence when Pilgrim watches a war film unfold backwards, watching as American and German planes slowly suck wounds and shrapnel from the cities and soldiers before delivering the bombs home to be dismantled and taken away where they will never be used again, or the overwhelming pain of the Dresden bombing itself. As much as Slaughterhouse Five is known for its humor, it's a quiet, dark humor, more of a bemusement at the world around it as a satire. But what lingers is not the humor; it's Vonnegut's inimitable, wonderful world view, one that I miss as the world continues to change on a daily basis. But, as the man himself wrote: So it goes.
B00008J2PG|4.0|This move is tue and that's what makes it very interesting..to see God give this priest the wisdom and protection against the Natzi's.  Gregory Peck plays the part so well and you have to snicker when he outsmarts the enemy.
0743289692|5.0|It is not often I can say that reading a book truly changed some of my views, or changed the way I looked at the world around me.  Ayaan Hirsi Ali's memoir is an amazing story of a woman's transition from a confidently muslim women to an atheist member of the Dutch parliament.  This amazing transformation is detailed by descriptions of the dysfunctions of her family and her culture, her genital mutilation, the arranged marriage which inspired her to take flight and the murder by muslim extremists of a director with whom she made a film criticizing islam.  What makes this book so special is not only the amazing story of her life and success but by the astute way her life story has changed her worldview.  The author is an incredibly keen, perceptive and intelligent women and provides the broader context for what her story means in relation to the broader questions of multiculturalism and the  supposed `war' between the west and islam.  At one point, the author herself was a hijab wearing, devout believer, more fundamentalist than many of her peers.  Hers is not a story of inborn skepticism or a gradual shift from a liberal `muslim' family but a more complete transformation from devout to nonbeliever.  This change in worldview and the tragic circumstances of her life is what makes her story so legitimate.  She bought in to the religion and the culture completely until she began to read about the enlightenment and to witness the success of secular democracies.  At this point, she came to the conclusion that some ways of living, some components of cultures are BETTER than others, not just DIFFERENT, but better.  This is obviously a controversial statement that flies in the face of a liberal, multi-cultural trend which has been increasing for decades.  In an effort to correct for the racist and imperial misdeeds of our past, liberal western society rightly has come to view other cultures through a less ethnocentric lens.  What is dangerous is when we go too far in to bending over backwards to protect systems which are damaging to the people within them.  For instance the claim is often made that many women in muslim societies choose to wear burkas.  This laughable assertion cannot be removed from the context of a societal structure that tells women that they are lust-magnets and that they will lose all respect if they don't cover themselves.  This isn't to say that there aren't some components of western society that are inferior but we need to have an honest dialogue that is untainted by protesting shouts of `racist' and `imperialist'.    This author's authentically disturbing story and her outspoken activism gives her viewpoint a special power.  For just as she has reached a state of prominence in Dutch society, she decides to expose the dangers of some components of the muslim society which she has fled.  The filming of a movie pointing out the misogyny in islam, causes a muslim extremist to murder the director and Ms. Ali to be protected by security for perhaps the rest of her life.  This murder would be farcical if it wasn't so tragically true.  The response to Danish cartoonists implying that islam is a violent religion, prompted violence to protest the implication that they were violent.  This is a dangerous trend.  While it may make more diplomatic sense to call islam a `religion of peace' and to imply that western ideals don't represent a threat to islam, in realistic terms this is often untrue.      This book is an amazing autobiography of an incredible women.  It is unfortunate that it requires the tragic life story of a young, black formerly muslim women to allow us to admit that there is misogyny, superstition and anti-intellectualism in some cultures.
B000W746GK|4.0|It's been a whole summer since we last saw Harry in his first adventure, The Sorcerer's Stone.  Since that time it appears as if he has spent his time doing the exact opposite of most school children, pining for the school year to begin.  This changes when he suddenly discovers that an elf named Dobby has invaded his room.  Dobby, a neurotic with a penchant for self inflicted harm, warns Harry that he cannot return to Hogwarts, lest he risks grave misfortune.  Since it wouldn't be a Harry Potter film without Hogwarts, Harry of course does not listen to the diminutive Dobby.  Not even Harry's cruel uncle, who puts bars on his bedroom windows, is able to keep Harry away from school, because soon Ron and his brothers bust their friend out of a permanent grounding with the aid of a vintage flying car.       Already one can tell that the second film will be an improvement over the cumbersome original.  Instead of a drawn out introduction that takes place in the world of muggles (those who cannot wield magic), the film moves right along and breezily reintroduces us to the trio of friends, along with a more fleshed out background for each.  We get to take a tour of Ron's magical, but working class, house, and we discover that neither of Hermione's parents are magical.  And, even if most of the big secrets are being saved for latter installments, we learn a little more about Harry's mysterious background and why he has the ability to talk to snakes.     For Americans, one of the chief appeals of the Harry Potter series is that the British setting is often as bizarre and mystifying as the world of magic: the characters send their children to boarding school, they drink tea socially and they are absolutely incapable of correctly pronouncing the word \\"schedule.\\"  But perhaps the most interesting aspect of British society that sneaks into world of Hogwarts is the acute sense of class difference.  In the last film Draco Malfoy appeared to represent the aristocratic classes, and here that theme is brought to the forefront.  We even get to meet Draco's father, who mocks Ron's dad for working for what appears to be some sort of magician's bureaucracy.  Likewise, the big bad is also concerned with class purity.  We learn that the founder of the Slytherin house once hid a chamber of secrets on the grounds of Hogwart's, and should the chamber ever be opened it would rid the school of the mudbloods, those whose parents have no magical abilities, leaving Hogwarts to the purebloods.       As is the case with most sequels, the filmmakers pump up the main villain so he is a more menacing threat than in the last film.  Following in the footsteps of some of the more famous serial killers, he has a penchant for writing messages on the wall in blood and stringing up cats.  And no, the villain isn't who you think he is.  I too thought it might be Charles Manson, but, at the risk of spoiling the ending of the film, I will tell you that is not the case.  (Although, if J.K. Rowling ever picks up her pen again, I think people would clamor for Harry Potter Versus the Manson Family).  The stakes seem higher this time, and during the climax of the film Harry is now old enough to actually battle the villain rather than, as he did in the first film, relying on the power of his mother's love, or some such nonsense.     Like all great sequels, The Chamber of Secrets deepens and enriches our understanding of the fantasy world thanks to additions both large and small.  We are introduced to a new character, Gilderoy Lockhart, played by Kenneth Branagh, a famous magician and writer whose ego far outpaces his skills.  We are keyed in on important moments in the history of Hogwarts, including the reason for the names of each house.  Perhaps the coolest addition to the many magical artifacts in Rowling's universe is a diary full of empty pages that can respond to written questions.       Of all the new magical toys, it is the flying car that speaks to the appeal of thebooks themselves.  The allure of Rowling's creation is that even though Harry's a kid, he is still an active agent within the world of adults.  Not only must he save the day, but he is often the only one who knows what is really going on in the halls of Hogwarts.  For most children, driving a car is the ultimate symbol of the fun and freedom of adulthood, and perhaps the only thing better than driving a car would be driving a flying car.  By putting Harry and Ron behind the wheel of the car, Rowling taps into most children's first temptation to join the world of adults.      The director, Chris Columbus, seems more assured of himself this time around.  In the last film the main plot would disappear for whole stretches at a time, as if Columbus had lost it under the couch.  But here each random thread and subplot builds into the larger story.  The result is that even though The Chamber of Secrets is longer than The Sorcerer's Stone, it actually feels shorter.  The action is also handled more deftly this time around.  The quidditch match is much more dynamic, for example.  The camera tilts and swoops just like the players themselves, making the game more kinetic.  Just as George Lucas watched old footage of WWII dogfights in order to capture the same kind of energy during Star Wars's space battles, Columbus likely watched Lucas's Star Wars series in order to liven up his broom flights.  The quidditch players are often seen flying in formation like the X-Wings before their assault on the Death Star and their broom chariots give off the humming sound of an engine the speeders in Return of the Jedi.       After watching the first film, I came away wondering what all of the fuss was about.  Sure, there were some imaginative ideas, but it lacked the sense of adventure that elevates the greatest of fantasy films.  While most of The Sorcerer's Stone felt like a rigid sketch of the book, The Chamber of Secrets is the first movie in the series that feels as if it can stand onits own without knowledge of the book it's based on.
B0008ENHTE|5.0|This is a great movie.  It records for history the way this country, specifically San Francisco, appeared in the late 1960's.  So many American cars!  This is the way I remember San Francisco as a child.  It does not look like this so much anymore.    The story line of this movie is terrific and keeps one on the edge of their seat.    Highly recommended.

B000VLOKQI|5.0|This product compiles a lot of accurate history of the band, band members and includes biography bits as told by the members themselves, relatives and friends. The audio and video qualities are excellent and is by far the best and most accurate documentary of The Who that I know. Pete, Roger, John and Keith are truly geniuses. How can Pete come up with all these great songs, I don't know, I know no better Rock, R&B bassist than The Ox. Some come darn close but he is unique. Keith's is a legend of drumming and we were very fortunate to have heard this unique talent. Truly envy those who got a chance to see him in concert, I mean, right there in front of their eyes! Roger's voice has a rasp and a tone that will never be equaled and his ability to take Pete's songs and 'own them' is really spectacular, anyone can sing these songs but could not reach that magical projection. The Who is for ever!
B003QNXPUK|1.0|I have always bought these protectors from Zagg for all of the versions of iPhones and have been very pleased with them...until the iPhone 4.  The problem is because of the iPhone 4 has all flat surfaces which makes it installing this a piece of cake but where you run into problems is when putting it in a case. The in and out motion will cause it to start peeling off. I thought I would correct that by buying the bumper from Apple and using it instead but the bumper moves around slightly and the edges of the bumper are at the edges of the protector which causes it to start pealing up.  I think one of the other problems may be the coating Apple puts on the glass front and backs to resist fingerprints, it seams even more than on the 3Gs. All other iPhones the protectors would stick to the surface so strong they were hard to peel away when removing, this iPhone I just grab a corner of the protector and peel it off like it has no adhesive on it at all.  If you have any other iPhone this product will keep it looking brand new, if you have the iPhone 4 save your money and look for something else.
1440503257|4.0|I just received this book and the recipes look great (aside from one served at Nick's deathday party), but I was very disappointed to not find a recipe for butterbeer. Other treats were included such as pumpkin juice, pumpkin pasties, Hagrid's rock cakes, acid pops, Harry's first birthday cake, treacle fudge, treacle tart, lemon drops, peppermint humbugs, canary creams,  and also many meals made by Mrs. Weasley or at the Hogwarts feasts, which unfortunately I cannot eat because I am a vegetarian and they are nearly all meat-based. Anyway, great cookbook! =)

0439813786|5.0|One of the greatest pleasures of being a mom is sharing books with your children, and The Invention of Hugo Cabret was the greatest of all such pleasures, because it was so completely surprising, original, stunning and enjoyable. The changing perspectives, the detailed artwork that carries the plot forward  -- full of imagination in ways that delighted both of us. What an absolute delight. And what a gift it is to parents who want to engage their children in the joy of reading.    Please Mr. Selznick, make many more.
0316098337|5.0|I love the book Room. It is about a young boy named Jack and his mother. They live as prisoners in a shed called the Room. This is a fictional novel, but Emma Donoghue makes me feel for these characters like they were real people. Emma Donoghue is the kind of writer that does not reveal too much too soon, and I like that.  She creates the setting of life in the room. The plot of the novel is not explained in the first chapter, but Donoghue gives the reader enough information to keep readers hooked.<br /><br />  She gives a gender to every object in the room. A rug and a plant are referred as feminine objects with the pronoun of she. A lamp and a watch are referred to with pronoun of he. Emma Donoghue gives each object a spirit and vitality in the novel by doing this.  I found this aspect of her writing to be enjoyable.<br /><br /> The lives of Jack and his mother are transformed in the novel.  This book is very exciting to read.  This is  because Emma Donoghue makes readers care about her characters so much.  They both go through individual trials in the book. The bond between mother and son is strong in this book.  I love how Jack's mother is able to educate her son with the limited resources available to her.  These characters possess qualities that I admire in people.  I admire the resilence and intelligence of Jack's mother and the courage of five year old Jack. They are strong willed fictional characters in a very moving novel.  I love the novel Room.
0812550706|5.0|I became a big fan of the science fiction genre because of \\"Ender's Game.\\" It's a great book about a kid named Andrew Wiggin (his nickname is Ender) who's recruited by the world military and trained through a series of intense games to help prepare him to fight and defeat an alien race known as the buggers that attacked and nearly destroyed Earth many years earlier. No one knows how soon the buggers will strike again, but they know the buggers are very much capable of annihilating the human race at any give moment. Understanding this, the military is in a hurry to train Ender, a kid they know has the potential to lead them to victory over these dangerous creatures. However, Ender's not that interested and would rather not do any harm to the buggers. He misses his family, especially his older sister Valentine who was his closest friend, and he knows there's something strange and mysterious about the buggers that makes them seem innocent to him. Will Ender try to make peace between the two sides or will he lead the military into an epic battle that could determine the fate of mankind?    This is one of my favorite books I've ever read. There's a lot of action, the character development is very rich, and the plot becomes more complex and intriguing as the story progresses. It's a very entertaining book with some surprising twists and turns. The ending is completely unpredictable and paves the way for the many sequels that follow this book. Orson Scott Card has written a lot of great sci-fi and fantasy novels throughout his storied career; not only is \\"Ender's Game\\" his best but it literally is one of the best sci-fi novels of all time.
0312944926|4.0|Another great book by the master of thrillers/mysteries. Not in the same league as Da Vinci Code or Angels and Demons but definitely worth the time and money. The thing with Dan Brown is that you either like the kind of books he writes or you hate them. I am one of his fans and he hasn't disappointed me to date.
1848566190|5.0|There are two other books collecting the work of the amazing Drew Struzan. Neither of these books included a substantial amount of Drew's sketches and preliminary drawings which are, in my opinion, some of his most incredible works. They finally got it right with \\"The Art of Drew Struzan\\". The book is filled with Drew's incredible comprehensive drawings. This book has great production values and wonderful, illuminating commentary from the artist himself. This is a fantastic art book, buy it.
159102594X|3.0|Generally I rate these types of series books by how eager I am to continue on to the next book. I gave this 3 stars because the last several chapters were very interesting and have me on the fence about whether or not I care to continue this journey. In the beginning this book was a total chore to read and I'm surprised I made myself finish it. The story just takes way too long to get rolling! Not to mention the predominantly male cast of characters, which I find dreary and uninteresting. I think what really intrigues me is the socio-political commentary that lies beneath the world building here. But since I've already ordered a book from a different author, I guess I'll have to get back to this series at a later time...
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|Just thought I would write a 5 star review to counteract all of the one and two star reviews. Those people obviously are not true Sex and the City fans. I love Sex and the City and I enjoyed BOTH of the movies. I'm reading reviews mentioning bad acting and no plot. This isn't a Merchant Ivory film or a deep, introspective drama... it is supposed to be a fun, light girl's movie, so lighten up with the movie critic jargon. You guys should be thankful all of the gals agreed to do another movie together rather than complaining about plot lines and wardrobe choices. I actually thought this movie was better than the first one because it had more comedy, more flashy and exotic scenes and more focus on fashion. Someone actually complained the movie wasn't set in New York. Didn't you get enough of New York watching the show? I love New York just as much as the next person, but I enjoyed the change of scenery and some of the footage of Abu Dhabi was breathtaking. I thought this movie tackled some subjects most movies try to ignore such as how taxing motherhood really is. I prefer the honesty about motherhood rather than the movies that always try to make it look like it is the most fun you'll ever have. It seems most of the complainers wanted the movie to have more substance to compensate for the lack of substance in their own lives. So, don't listen to them... go see it for yourself and enjoy it for what it is - a light movie to remind us all how fun life can really be (especially when you're on vacation).
B000UD0ESA|5.0|Six replicants, designed to be indistinguishable from human beings, return to Earth and must be hunted and destroyed by a \\"blade runner\\" (Harrison Ford) who is conflicted over the ethics of his assignment.    Ridley Scott's classic SF film receives its definitive version in this final cut.  I do not know the film well enough to detect most of the changes, but I was swept up in Scott's noir vision of the future just as with previous viewings.  This film features great action sequences, but also an interesting and richly detailed setting in its LA of the future.  The story is drenched in despair and regret with glimmers of quiet hope.
B003QCCS36|4.0|Actually, I would like to hear this on vinyl. I might have given it 5 stars. The CD has a good rootsy low-fi sound.  Sounds even better when you turn it up.  Good pedal steel and guitar by Eric Heywood and Greg Leiz.
B001JV5BIA|1.0|As a serious horror fan, I have heard of The Last House on the Left many times, though had not ever seen it.<br />I found it on the \\"$5 DVDs\\" shelf and since it had named like Wes Craven, Sean Cunningham, and Steve Miner attached to it, I thought I had found a gem at a charcoal price.<br /><br />Having now watched it, I pretty much got exactly what I paid for.<br /><br />The acting is sometimes not all that important to me when it comes to Horror, as long as the story and effects are good.

The acting always seemed as if the actors had just gotten their lines moments before the cameras rolled.<br /><br />2.) The story, while a good one, was displayed quite poorly...characters would finish talking yet the scene would linger for several more seconds, \\"graphic\\" scenes would suddenly cut to \\"comedic\\" scenes or a scenes regarding a different part of the storyline, then come back to the \\"graphic\\" scene again. (Note that I put the words graphic and comedic in quotations; that is because the scenes were neither graphic nor comedic, though they obviously were trying), and there was never any moments in my viewing where I felt any level of psychological or tense drama.<br /><br />3.) The music was often upbeat, even in scenes that were supposed to be dramatic. In fact, the music was just plain terrible all through this movie.<br /><br />4.) Plot Holes! The villans are shown in clothes that have gotten quite dirty and messy, their car had broken down so they're stuck in the woods, yet when they go to the Mari's Parent's home up the hill, they somehow managed to aquire clean, almost business-like clothes, hair combed and no sign of dirt on them anywhere.

0321687299|5.0|If I was to describe this book in five words, the review title says it all.    As an early (but not as early as Bruce or Remy) adopter of HTML5, I know a fair bit about the subject matter but after reading this book I realised how much I didn't know. As well as talking about the well known new features of HTML5 such as video, audio, canvas and forms, Bruce and Remy also delve into such diverse topics as ARIA (for accessibility), data storage, offline applications, the (nasty) drag and drop API and even the geolocation API (even though it's not strictly part of HTML5).    The book is littered with clear explanations and well written, amusing, sometimes weird, coding examples. There is no glossing over the fact that HTML5 is far from perfect, and that the HTML5 specification itself isn't finalised and therefore subject to change but the authors do a great job of keeping the content interesting and fresh.    It's a refreshing and honest approach to a technical book and one I highly recommend to web developers either new to the world of HTML5 or wanting to find out more.
B003INBOEM|1.0|Disk seemed to start OK but once it transitioned into the short clip right before the menu it froze. I have a Panasonic BD30 with latest firmware and have NEVER had a BluRay freeze like this. Amazon return was easy as always. To the reviewers who say it's wrong to give a 1 star review for this movie based on a bad disk I completely disagree. I'm rating a product, not a movie, and this product appears to me to be defective. The manufacturer needs to get the message.
B001GCUO4S|2.0|As in all the previous Final Destination films, a group of characters escape death after one of them experiences a premonition of a terrible disaster.  They spend the rest of the movie in a futile attempt to escape their fate.  I thought the first three movies were okay if you have a hankering for gory mayhem, but this one was so bad that I found myself thinking up my own horror franchise: a group of characters find themselves trapped in a film written by a lazy screenwriter and spend the rest of the movie in a futile attempt to escape their fate.  Fortunately, your attempts need not be futile: push EJECT.
0765326353|5.0|The book starts out as a little confusing at first, but remembering that Mr. Sanderson is a writer that delivers, you continue and are rewarded immediately with very good writing and story line.  He is sooooo good at creating worlds that are not the normal story line.  I have read all his other works.  I enjoyed Warbreakers especially because he completed the story in one book.  I thought at first that since the book was so thick he was doing the same here, but I am glad that he is continueing it.  This is a good read.  No you can't finish it in one day, but you certainly can enjoy the book for several days.

B0034JKZ3G|1.0|Let me begin by saying that our family loves Disney movies. We own around 400 different titles covering everything you can think of. So when I say that a Disney title is not worth buying (let alone watching)it has to be really bad. First, this movie should be rated PG-13 for the voodoo, shadow people, and the scene of the bad guy being dragged down to the bad place. Think of the scene in Ghost where the bad guy gets dragged off by the shadows and ask yourself if you want your little kids watching that. Same thing here. Maybe even worse.    Next, the characters were flat and boring. They were so stereotypical I found myself wondering what was for dinner rather than wondering how the movie would end.    Finally, the real hook for this film was to present the first black princess. And yet she spends most of the movie as a frog. What is up with that?    This title will be on my (short) list of Disney movies I will never buy or watch again. Thank goodness Toy Story 3 came out so there is something worth watching from Disney this year.
0553805371|3.0|Hawking and Mlodinow do a great job making a lot of difficult scientific concepts understandable and sharing important scientific developments. But too many of their claims are presented with little or no good argumentation. We should accept scientific determinism because of the very weak arguments presented? We should accept the bizarre \\"Feynman sum over histories\\" over other quantum theories just because it works and they think it's the best view? More seriously, applying this concept to produce multiple universes just seems groundless. If the authors think we should accept their claims, they need to give better arguments.     The biggest problem is their slight-of-hand trick to spontaneously produce the universe out of nothing. If in the earliest universe time behaved like space (p.134) that does not get rid of a beginning of time. What caused the space-like time to change, to become time-like? Or where did the tenseless space-time come from? It couldn't have always been timelessly there, but even if it could have been, we need something to get it going, something to cause it to become the temporal universe we have now (or at least since the big bang). The old cosmological argument is still the only reasonable alternative. A timeless Person can get it going; a timeless non-personal entity cannot. Hawking says the universe will create itself from nothing if we have the right natural laws (p.180). Yet if laws cannot apply to nothing, then there can be no laws if there is nothing. To believe something can come from nothing is no better than belief in magic.     Hawking appears to have come to reject the need for a God only fairly recently according to interviews ([...]). On his visit to Jerusalem he is recounted as saying in essence that he believes in a deistic God, a God who got the laws of nature going. (\\"The Driver of Mister Hawking\\" Jerusalem, 22 Dec 2006, p, 28). He rejected a God with whom we could have relationship: \\"When you look at the vast size of the universe and how insignificant an accidental human life is in it, that seems most impossible.\\" (ABC interview, above.) But if there is a God who has the intelligence and power to create the laws needed to allow for life, one would think this God would hardly be concerned about size, as if God were unable to know about the complexity of an amoeba. And if human life has the one characteristic in common with God nothing else in the universe possesses, namely intelligent consciousness, then one would think this would make us much more significant in God's eyes. (If there exist conscious, intelligent aliens elsewhere in our universe, then we are at least in this same class of beings God would be interested in.)
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Is there a period piece that BBC hasn't done well?<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed all the performances, from Tim Pigot-Smith's  Mr. Hale with his gentle but sometimes awkward approach to dealing with his wife, to Sinead Cusack's no-nonsense staunch support of her son.  The show was stolen by Richard Armitage whose performance swung from harsh to stunningly emotional.  His scenes with Daniela Denby-Ashe never left me in doubt of good chemistry between them as they portrayed Margaret Hale and Mr. Thornton.<br /><br />The production values were excellent, showing the contrast between Margaret's idyllic life in the south to the harsh atmosphere of a northern industrial town. It was highlight by the difference in mannerisms and speech between the characters as well.  It wasn't hard to pick out the class system of the times.  The scenes shot in the cotton mill itself were a good use of how harsh it must have been, relying on the almost automatonical movements of the machines and the contrast of the white of the cotton and the black of their attire.<br /><br />The screenplay was a good adaptation of Gaskell's story, and the use of windows and the train platform at the end was a very good example of how the characters belong in separate worlds until, finally, Margaret and Thornton meet, exiting trains to speak on a middle ground that they had strove to find, but previously failed at.

B003O85W3A|5.0|It's Arcade Fire's best album so far if you're more into, say, their interesting hooks and sound layering than in the bombastic, self-indulgent aspect of their previous stuff.  These songs are all built closely around the theme of ... well, suburbs ... but they're also relatively self-contained.  Proper pop songs, at least for the most part.  Both the songwriting and performance style are cooler and more restrained this time around.  It's not that their style is \\"mature\\" now--that's usually not a nice thing to say about a rock band--but rather that this album features more of what Arcade Fire do really well, and less of the dramatic emoting.  Which makes the emoting pack more punch, where it does appear.
B00020HEL6|5.0|Rather difficult to believe this girl was 15 when she made this album. Quite something!     It's also quite astonishing to listen to her and realize she couldn't have experienced half the things she's singing about (\\"Meet me at midnight that's when things get nice\\"?!), yet she does it with so much feeling and aplomb, she's totally believable. Imagine what she will be like at 30...    I highly recommend this if you like beautiful, melodic jazz. We're going to hear a lot more about this girl.

It's a very popular album, but I can't understand why, since the title track is about the only truly great song on here, with maybe two or three other tracks that are really worth five stars. Acdc are the masters of rock, but this album doesn't cut it for me.

0307712508|5.0|This book is 50% biography and 50% science; and it adds up to 100% fascinating. Wow - I couldn't put it down!    I have worked with HeLa cells many times during my career in microbiology, and I've always wondered about the woman from whom they originated. I was always very much aware that behind every one of the medical tests I performed lay a real person whose life might depend on the accuracy and insight of my work. I wanted to know as much as possible about that person, both to keep my focus on the real reason for the work I was doing, and to gain insight that might contribute to the patient's diagnosis and treatment.    And although I knew that \\"HeLa\\" had died in 1951, I felt the same way about working with the cells from her malignant cervical tumor. I wanted to know more about her, to always be aware of and empathetic to the real person and her suffering. But I graduated before Rebecca Skloots did, at a time when even less was known about \\"HeLa.\\" I didn't know Henrietta Lacks' name, that she was African-American, her age when she died, or how long she was ill; and I had never seen the photo of her that is now so famous. I wondered whether she had any children, and what became of them when she died.    So I was thrilled when this book came out, and it has been on my \\"priority tbr\\" list since I first heard of it. It lived up to, and even exceeded, my expectations. It answered all my questions, and brought up many new ones, the answers to some of which may never be known.    Henrietta's life was a hard one. She lost her own mother at the age of four and was raised by her grandparents. Life for her was an endless struggle against poverty. But one thing she did have was a large and close-knit extended family. Even without a mother, she learned well the arts of caring and nurturing; and all of her adult life she fed and took in other family members who needed help. She married a cousin with whom she'd grown up, and they had five children. There doesn't seem to be somuch as a hint of a rumor that she ever had any other lover in all her life. But life was unfair to Henrietta. Her husband was a notorious philanderer, with the result that she was constantly plagued by sexually transmitted diseases. One of them - HPV - gave her cervical cancer and was also the reason for her cells' immortality. (Normal cells live for only about 50 divisions, then die. But the HeLa cells cultured from Henrietta's tumor are still living and reproducing sixty years later, and that is what makes them so valuable to science.) Henrietta had three venereal diseases at the same time during her cancer treatments. Her cancer was incredibly aggressive, and she died after months of terrible agony. One can only hope that her spirit survives somewhere to know that the tragedy of her life was given meaning by her contribution to medical science - arguably the most important in the history of medicine.    The story of Henrietta's older daughter Elsie is even more heartbreaking. She was born deaf, mute, epileptic, and perhaps retarded due to congenital syphilis (meaning she contracted it in her mother's womb. All 5 of the Lacks children suffered neural hearing disabilities from the same cause.) At least one family member believes that Elsie may not have been retarded at all, but was simply unable to communicate due to her deafness. No matter what her IQ might have been, her story is utterly horrifying. A photo of Elsie from when she still lived at home shows her to be a strikingly beautiful child; and also clean, healthy, and happy. But when Henrietta became so ill, she could no longer care for her daughter and Elsie was institutionalized. What happened to the 11-year-old girl in the Crownsville State Hospital for the Negro Insane is so shocking and awful that it's almost unbelievable. This part of the book is very difficult to read, but it's important that people know - both to honor Elsie's memory, and to make sure that such things do not happen again.    Henrietta died before her younger daughter Deborah was old enough to remember her, and Deborah was to spend the rest of her life longing for information about her mother and sister, trying to forge some kind of connection with her lost ones. Deborah's help and commitment to finding the truth was vital in the writing of this book.    Sloot comes across as sincere and as having developed a genuine and lasting bond with Henrietta's family, rather than as simply a dispassionate and objective reporter. This was instrumental to her research, as the family had been \\"burned\\" several times by unscrupulous characters who only wanted to cash in on the story for their own profit. It made the Lacks family defensive and ultra cautious. Before Skloot could even begin writing the book, she first had to win their trust. And she does seem to have honored that, by setting up a scholarship trust fund for the education of Henrietta's descendants and donating a portion of the book's profits to it. Another, indirect, result of this book is the donation of tombstones for Henrietta's and her daughter Elsie's previously unmarked graves.    The information given in the book about the ways in which Henrietta's cells have contributed to science and helped other people is fascinating and amazing! Without HeLa, the polio vaccine and the most effective cancer medications wouldn't exist; nor could the HIV virus have been identified. And these are just the beginning: the list goes on and on.    The book concludes with a thorough discussion of the ethics of medical research on human tissues. Henrietta's sons have a strong sense of injustice that their mother's cells were taken without her knowledge or permission, and that so many people have made vast amounts of money off of them while her children cannot afford basic medical care. And who can blame them? They do have a point. Patient privacy is another problem that arises when working with human cells, especially now that their DNA can be fingerprinted. Skloot interviews many experts with widely varying opinions about these issues, and shows us how extremely complex the matter is, with no easy answers.    The book includes some great photos. And if you go to the author's website, you can see many more photos, including some of the ones described but not included in the book. [...]    My one criticism of this book was that it left some questions unanswered that probably could have been answered. Especially - and this one's driving me crazy - what were the caged creatures that frightened Margaret Lacks so, when she got lost in the basement of Johns Hopkins Hospital - the \\"man-sized rabbits\\"? (I'm guessing kangaroos.) Also, why were Henrietta's children allowed to be born with damage from congenital syphilis? Why wasn't Henrietta treated for it? Her first two kids (including Elsie) were born at home, so she probably didn't have access to professional medical care at that time. But the others were born in hospitals. Was it that she didn't have any prenatal care, so that by the time she was in labor it was too late? Or that the effective penicillin treatment wasn't commonly available yet? Was it available but not given to indigent black patients?    I also noticed that Skloots uses the inaccurate term \\"hereditary syphilis\\" rather than the correct \\"congenital syphilis.\\" But given the extensive amount of research she did (the book took 10 years to write) I suspect that was a deliberate choice rather than an error. Skloots may have felt that readers without a scientific background would better understand the word \\"hereditary\\". Actually \\"hereditary\\" refers to features that are inherited by way of genes; \\"congenital\\" simply means that a person is born with some condition, and it may or may not be hereditary. Syphilis is not a genetic disease, but one that comes from being infected by the microorganism. In congenital syphilis, the fetus is infected while in the womb and the disease has already caused permanent damage by the time the baby is born.    Further evidence of the massive research project undertaken by Ms. Skloots can be seen in the appendices. The \\"Acknowledgments\\" section is actually interesting to read, as it gives further information about members of the Lacks family and their story. And beware when reading the \\"Notes\\" section - as well as thousands of technical scientific articles, it describes hundreds of interesting-sounding books for further reading that might threaten to overwhelm your tbr list!    Oprah Winfrey and Alan Ball are working together on producing a movie based on The Immortal Life on Henrietta Lacks. Thanks to this book, Henrietta and her family are finally getting the recognition they deserve. On the inside back of the book jacket, there is a website address given where you can donate to the foundation for the education of Henrietta's descendants. I hope that everyone who reads the book will do that, even if they can only afford a small contribution. [...]    (358 pages)
0006748287|5.0|I was required to buy this book for a class.  I had never heard of the book before.  It became the kind of book that was difficult to put down once I began reading it.  Somewhat unusual story line, but as a future teacher, the book contains so many great concepts from which to teach from.  Highly recommend it, though I would probably not involve children until late middle school.

B003C5FMEE|4.0|I bought this CD for my girlfriend's birthday and have ended up listening to it way more than she does. It has a variety of music styles. There's also an appearance from Lenny Kravitz on one of the tracks. If you like bands like Galactic then you'll like Trombone Shorty. The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because though I enjoy listening to the CD, I wish there were less instrumental songs and more songs with vocals. But I am still very pleased with this CD and glad my girlfriend introduced me to this talented musician. Also, it shipped faster than I expected. That was awesome!

Saw her at Radio City Music Hall a couple of years ago and she was wonderful.    I recently read that Martina was going on tour with the Dixie Chicks in Canada.  I was shocked. If that is true, I will not be buying any more of her CD's.    Hope it is not true!

0786955570|5.0|This game is a fun, cooperative dungeon crawl for up to 5 players. It takes about 60 minutes to complete an adventure. The play is fast and furious. The players' chance of success is around 50%, which keeps things interesting. I have played D&D for many years and have usually had to play the bad guys because no one else wanted to DM. This game is like a greatly simplified version of D&D that allows me to play a hero for once. The game runs itself without a DM, for example, through the use of simple AI tactics for the monsters. All in all, it is great fun. It is simple enough that young children can even play. If you want a quick, fun, and exciting dungeon crawling board game, this is it. I just hope that Wizards of the Coast publishes some expansions for the game to increase the number of options available in the future. Extra monsters, character classes, encounters, and treasures would be most welcome.
B0019NB9A2|5.0|Before I get to my review of the Picture/Sound quality of the blu ray release, let me say that this was my first time to ever see Forbidden Planet.  As far as the movie goes, I liked it very much.  But considering it is still considered a classic some 50 years later, you probably already knew it was good.<br /><br />I'm also not a techie, but after discovering the magic of blu ray I haven't turned back and have become somewhat of a 1080p snob.  If it's not blu, I don't watch it.  So I feel fairly confident when I say that I thought the picture quality was outstanding.  I've seen great transfers and I've seen some alright transfers, Forbidden Planet probably wasn't at the top, but it wasn't anywhere close to the bottom.<br /><br />The dark void of space was crisp and vivid and Anne Francis' marvelous short dresses dazzle with color.  In fact, the picture quality was so clear that I could (unfortunately) see that Anne was wearing a skin-colored suit as she started to emerge from the pond.  For some fans, no doubt, this might be considered a bad thing.<br /><br />Likewise the audio was sharp and clear, a lossless 5.1 DTS-HD MA release that won't test your system but it will greatly enhance the classic movie watching experience.<br /><br />All in all, I'm so glad I was able to take part in watching a Hollywood classic with today's amazing HD technology.  I can see now why it was influential enough for The Rocky Horror Picture Show to reference it!

0307454541|3.0|I was all excited about reading this book because of how big it has become in the United States, Sweden, and all over the world. I should have known better!!! Rarely does a book or film get so much press and actually meet the expectations that you find yourself having for it. Why did this book get so much press while there are far better books that have more interesting characters and more of a polished ending? Okay enough introduction, here are my problems with the book:<br /><br />1) Mikael Blomkvist was not a interesting nor engaging character:<br /><br />The guy was so boring and aloof that I wondered why he was even in the book to begin with. How in the hell did so many women fall in love with him? Okay looks can be overcome(sometimes!), so he does not have to be handsome(hell, the guy in the Swedish movie and Daniel Craig are not particularly handsome nor attractive), but his personality should explain why so many women are into him. His personality was absent in this novel. The sex scenes in this novel are non-existent so his sexual prowess can not be cited as a reason.<br /><br />2) Why is Lisbeth Salandar, arguably the savior of the entire book, only in portions of the book? It would seem that she would take over and save the author the trouble of creating the character of Mikael Blomkvist. I mean, honestly I spent so much time flipping pages and looking for more sections in the book that featured Lisbeth.<br /><br />3) What happened to Lisbeth Salander's guardian? I don't wanna spoil this so I won't elaborate further, but it was a big part of the book for me---what happened between the guardian and Lisbeth that is. Hmmm maybe in the second book<br /><br />4) Why did they cover everything up? Doesn't make sense! If you read the book you'll know what I'm talking about. Okay I understand that the family does not want its name dirtied, BUT DAMN!!! They covered up too much.<br /><br />5) After the mystery of the Harriet girl was uncovered why didn't the book just end? Okay, I know that there had to be a set up for the next book, but the author could have made the ending more smooth. Did I have to feel that I ran into an excerpt from the end of a different book? I get that tying up the loose ends is important, but the mystery has been solved so the set up should have been shorter and less verbose.<br /><br />I could go on, but then I would be giving spoilers instead of giving a review. Overall, this a good book, BUT IT IS NOT WORTH THE HYPE!!!up for the next book, but the author could have made the ending more smooth.

0061714372|4.0|This book should have been called Hello Me...Meet The Real Me like it says on the back cover. If you are a Mustaine fan, or even if you hate him, this is a book you should read. I have been an admirer for many years since I heard a song called Good Mourning/Black Friday. That song still kicks my ass!! Dave goes deep into what he's been through. All of the drugs, women, bands, music, band members, and kids are covered here. The only problem I have with this book is that he doesnt go into detail about his inspiration for songs, but, maybe that is for another book. I have to admit, I wish the Rust lineup were back together for the new Deth, but, we still have the 2 Daves, so that will be about as good as it gets, but, its always nice to dream. The part of the book that flipped me out was the issue with Jay Reynolds. Mr Reynolds had some serious balls to do what he did. Of course the \\"other\\" band that Dave was in is talked about (YAWN), but it was short and sweet. This is one of the best books I have read this year, by far. PICK IT UP!!!
0312370849|5.0|Although a work of fiction, Sarah's Key is based on the real events of the Paris roundup of Jewish families in the early morning of July 16, 1942 and their eventual deportations from France to certain death.<br /><br />The most compelling and emotional parts of this book are in it's beginning, especially the disturbing conditions at the V&eacute;lodrome d'Hiver where the parents and children were interned before taking trains out of Paris. How they suffered such appalling conditions with little food, water and no sanitation. All under the watchful eyes of French policemen.<br /><br />The author, Tatianna de Rosnay, knew this could not be a historical novel.

B000000W6F|5.0|Gish is easily the best Smashing Pumpkins album of them all. I was introduced to this at the age of 18 by one of my band members. It's beautiful, moving, full of emotion and energy. Not only is my favorite Smashing Pumpkins CD, it's one of my all time favorite CD's period. Even after all these years I can still pop this one in, sit back and close my eyes, and it takes me on a musical and emotional journey. Every single track is excellent.<br /><br />I Am One starts with a slick drum riff, kicks in a bass groove, then the guitars come in and the whole thing just grabs you.<br /><br />Siva starts out aggressive and makes you want to drive fast or kick something over, but then around the middle it calms down and you feel like you're out walking in the woods... just when you think you're floating on a cloud, it comes back and grabs you and shakes you around again. Then it smooths out one more time before spinning you yet again and leaving you tumbling through the air.<br /><br />Rhinoceros is beautiful, making you think of someone you once loved, but then it comes on heavy and builds up, then lets you down softly at the end.<br /><br />Bury Me is excellent guitar work all through. The band is very tight, and this sounds like it would be a very fun song to play.<br /><br />Crush is a mellow song all the way though, beautiful and haunting.<br />Suffer continues on the theme, building up to a crescendo towards the end, then letting you back down.<br /><br />Snail is another haunting, wistful song, but with more guitars and a driving rhythm. This is the song off the album that gets stuck in my head... easily my favorite. This song seems to sum up the entire album for me, and is what I love the most about their sound from this time. Much like most of their songs on Gish, with this one, once you think you're melting into it and losing yourself, it picks you up and tosses you around.<br /><br />Tristessa is straight up rock, a catchy hook, punchy guitars, just a really fun song. Hang on!<br /><br />Window Paine is another song that starts of soft and smooth, haunting, wistful, then picks up slowly, building up harder and faster until a teasing, lingering finish.<br /><br />Daydream is the final track, sung by the band's bassist, who really has a beautiful voice. I wish we could hear more of her. This song is soft and acoustic throughout, with some orchestral strings giving it a pensive, introspective feeling.<br /><br />Buy Gish now.

6304711905|3.0|I love Tombstone. It's a great movie, one of my favorite popcorn westerns. That said, this isn't a great transfer. The sound is muddy, and way too quiet. I was trying to watch it with my dad, and he had a hard time making out the dialog even with the sound on his TV cranked to 100%. I've not seen/heard the \\"director's cut\\" version ([[ASIN:B00005RHGL Tombstone - The Director's Cut (Vista Series)]]), but I'd have to guess its sound is better than this. It's a 5-star movie (as long as you're not expecting an Oscar-caliber script), but I had to take off a couple stars because of the DVD's quality.

Though they let her go unharmed, Claire is nervously aware that the robbers know her name and where she lives. But she lets her guard down when she meets an unassuming and rather charming man named Doug not realizing that he is the same man who only days earlier had terrorized her. The instant attraction between them gradually turns into a passionate romance that threatens to take them both down a dangerous, and potentially deadly, path.    The cast led by Ben Affleck (who also directed and co-wrote the screenplay) (in an excellent performance as Doug MacRay), Rebecca Hall (as Claire Keesey), Jon Hamm (as Frawley), Jeremy Renner (as Jem), Blake Lively (as Krista), Pete Postlethwaite (as Fergie) & Chris Cooper (as Stephen MacRay) is excellent! The directing by Affleck (who also directed & co-wrote the screenplay to \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" (2007) is excellent! The screenplay (based on Chuck Hogan's novel \\"Prince Of Thieves\\") by Affleck, Aaron Stockard (who also co-wrote the screenplay to \\"Gone Baby Gone\\", also an associate producer) & Peter Craig is excellent!    The music by Harry Gregson-Williams (who also did the music to \\"Gone Baby Gone\\", \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\" (2009), \\"The Taking Of Pelham 1 2 3\\" (2009), \\"The Shrek movies\\" (2001, 2004, 2007 & 2010), \\"Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time\\" (2010) & the upcoming \\"Unstoppable\\" (2010) & David Buckley (who also did the music to \\"The Forbidden Kingdom\\" (2008) & \\"From Paris With Love\\" (2010) is excellent! The cinematography by Robert Elswit (who also did the cinematography to \\"Michael Clayton\\" (2007), \\"There Will Be Blood\\" (2007), \\"Redbelt\\" (2008), \\"Duplicity\\" (2009), \\"The Men Who Stare At Goats\\" (2009), \\"Salt\\" (2010) & the upcoming \\"Mission: Impossible IV\\" (2011) is excellent! The film editing by Dylan Tichenor (who also did the film editing to \\"Boogie Nights\\" (1997), \\"Magnolia\\" (1999), \\"Unbreakable\\" (2000), \\"The Royal Tenenbaums\\" (2001), \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" (2005), \\"The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford\\" (2007), \\"There Will Be Blood\\" & \\"Doubt\\" (2008) is excellent! The casting by Lora Kennedy (who also did the casting to \\"Tombstone\\" (1993), \\"The Boondock Saints\\" (1999), \\"Swordfish\\" (2001), \\"Syriana\\" (2005) & the upcoming \\"Sucker Punch\\" (2011) is excellent! The production design by Sharon Seymour (who also did the production design to \\"Bad Santa\\" (2003), \\"Friday Night Lights\\" (2004), \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" & \\"The Men Who Stare At Goats\\") is excellent! The art direction by Peter Borck (who also did the art direction to \\"Bad Santa\\", \\"Friday Night Lights\\", \\"Freedom Writers\\" (2007) & \\"The Men Who Stare At Goats\\") is excellent! The set decoration by Maggie Martin (who also did the set decoration to \\"Ladder 49\\" (2004), \\"Red Eye\\" (2005) & \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" (2009) is excellent! The costume design by Susan Matheson (who also did the costume design to \\"Friday Night Lights\\", \\"Talladega Nights: The Ballad Of Ricky Bobby\\" (2006), \\"The Kingdom\\" (2007), \\"Step Brothers\\" (2008), \\"Couples Retreat\\" (2009) & the upcoming \\"Fright Night\\" (2011) is excellent!    This is a brilliant film that is well-made and well-acted by its cast & director. Ben Affleck's follow-up to his debut with \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" is brilliant. This is one of the best movies of the year, so far, and it also looks like to be an Oscar contender, as well. This is a little bit better than \\"Gone Baby Gone\\".

All the treasures of nature and spirit are open to man who will use his mind rightly.<br />Make your thinking orderly and free from emotional overtones, and you will see people and things as they are, with clarity and charity.<br /><br />The main point to grasp is that you have projected onto yourself a world of your own imagination, based on memories, on desires and fears, and that you have imprisoned yourself in it.<br />Having identified yourself with a speck of a body you feel lost and search desperately for the sense of fullness and completeness you call happiness.<br /><br />Learn to look without imagination, to listen without distortion: that is all. Stop attributing names and shapes to the essentially nameless and formless, realize that every mode of perception is subjective,<br />that what is seen or heard, touched or smelt, felt or thought, expected or imagined, is in the mind and not in reality, and you will experience peace and freedom from fear.<br /><br />Fear and greed cause the misuse of the mind. The right use of mind is in the service of love, of life, of truth, of beauty.<br />What kind of world can a man create who is stupid, greedy, and heartless?<br /><br />Assert your independence in thought and action. After all, all hangs on your faith in yourself, on the conviction that what you see and hear, think and feel is real.<br />Why not question your faith? No doubt, this world is painted by you on the screen of consciousness and is entirely your own private world.<br /><br />The 'I am' is in the world; but it is the key which can open the door out of the world. To become free, your attention must be drawn to the 'I am', the witness.<br />The moon dancing on the water is seen in the water, but it is caused by the moon in the sky and not by the water.<br /><br />The final answer is this: nothing is.

B002UNMW7O|3.0|It may be impossible to review BOODOCK SAINTS II: ALL SAINTS DAY having not seen the original, but every movie, no matter how far down the line they are in the sequel queue, should be judged on its own merits.  This film about two Irish brothers who are vigilantes with a bifurcated means of delivering justice (murder in the name of the Church) was written by brothers Troy and Taylor Duffy (Troy Duffy also directs) from Connecticut whose only credits include the same roles for the 1999 original BOONDOCK SAINTS and paling in their own band named after the movie. It has moments that entertain, but the film is primarily concerned with noise, slaughter, potty mouth dialogue, and confusing use of forward and backward black and white film clips that are supposed to serve clarifying the confusing plot.<br /><br />The McaManus brothers (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus), some years past their initial episode of crime in the name of the Church in Boston, are living a quiet life in Ireland with their father (Billy Connolly), but when they learn their beloved priest has been killed by mob forces, the duo return to Boston to bring justice to those responsible. They take on an assistant - Mexican fighter Clifton Collins, Jr. - and plan the destruction of the killers of the priest.  Naturally there are cops who were in one the original assassinations and they fear for their MacManus friends, but the FBI Special Agent Eunice (Julie Benz, sporting a maladaptive Southern drawl) enters and takes over and the rest is history - and blood, and murders, and caricatures of crime bosses, and noise, and CGI effects.  There are a number of actors with bit parts - Willem Dafoe, Judd Nelson, Peter Fonda - that add little to the big pie. One of the advantages of the DVD is the option to turn on subtitles: otherwise the dialogue is fairly indecipherable under the noise and the 'music score' by Jeff Danna. There must bean audience out there for this kind of movie - otherwise a sequel would never have been made 10 years from the original!  Grady Harp, September 10e been made 10 years from the original!

B003F3NE1Q|5.0|In all honesty, the very first episode of this season made me very un-sure how to feel. I was so shocked by what had transpired that I had to convince myself to stick around. Oh gosh, am I glad I did. What an amazing season. The characters have developed so immensely and it is incredibly entertaining to watch. Not to mention, the actors were spot on in their characterizations. Such excellent acting this season. The story lines were interesting, engaging, and really heart wrenching at times.   The season finale was the most intense two-hour television event I had ever watched. The entire time I was on the edge of my seat. I showed it to some people who absolutely loathed the series, and they ended up changing their minds.  This is a must have for anyone who enjoys down right good television.
B001HN694K|2.0|To start I do not have a love affair with Burton/Depp movies. They have some good, they have some awful, and then there is Wonderland. To me it showcases some what quality actors can do with a bad script, and bad movie. The over the top colors, and cinematography were an attempt to cover up a poor story. I really look at this movie as a 2.5 out of 5. Bad movie, bad story, bad cinematography, but very well done acting, and deliverance of lines.    In the end if you are like mnay who simply fall in love with ever Burton/Depp movie, then I am sure you will rate this movie higher and not share my feelings. However, to each their own and for anyone thinking about buying before viewing it once, I would not recomend that path.

0374158460|1.0|I actually listened to the audio version of this book, but the thought I kept returning to again and again is that I didn't think the author was somebody I'd like. It is true that the whole book was tedious, bogged down in details and repetition of details, but what bothered me most was the characters. They seemed to be more caricatures -- and I just can't tell you how tired I got of reading the shallow lustings of the male mind after females for no reasons beyond that they were hot, which went on and on and on. Politics were thrown in, but other than that there seemed to be very little depth of thought or feelings. I will admit that the narration of the audio book was horrible, which didn't help, but I don't think I could have kept plowing through page after page of this book in written form.
0618918248|4.0|I cannot say anything of relevance that hasn't already been said. The critiques offered by J. A. Magill and Harvey Ardman cover it well enough. However, I do have my 2 cents worth, although, I won't dwell on the intellectual notions proffered by these gentlemen.<br />For the average man and woman, those of us who wonder about our existance--where we came from and where we're going, if anywhere--The God Delusion helps shed light on what Dawkins believes, whether right or wrong. What he writes is certainly worthy of reading by anyone, especially those that profess a religious affiliation. The book obviously spawns debate and debate, in turn, encourages thinking. THINKING, one of the most popular teaching concepts of Jesus, Muhammad, Confucious, Budda etc. As a population of 'seekers', around the world, we seem to ignore THINKING in favor of dogma.

0316098337|5.0|Jack is 5 years old. He's lucky: He gets to spend entire days with Ma. \\"We have thousands of things to do every morning,\\" he says, \\"like give Plant a cup of water in Sink for no spilling.\\" He gets to noticing little things, too. \\"Our underwear\\" is different, Jack observes -- \\"hers has no bears.\\"  Jack happily spends his days with Ma inside an 11-foot-square room. He has never been outside it. Not ever.  The horrific circumstances of their imprisonment -- and what continues during it -- are unknown to Jack, of course. Ma has made sure of that.  When days are long, she knows, routine's important. \\"I'm the boss of play but Ma's the boss of meals,\\" Jack informs us. She limits TV coz it'll rot his brain. They fill their days -- isolated for Ma, magical for Jack -- with games like Pirate Ship, Eye Stretch, Islands, Soup of the Evening, Telephone with toilet rolls, Keypad, Phys Ed. (Also Remote, Scream and Corpse.)  But confinement isn't all fun and games. Sometimes Jack and Ma argue. Sometimes Ma takes \\"killers\\" for her pain, and then she's Gone for the whole next day. Jack deals with his fears by lying awake, counting his teeth, worrying about monsters. Is he afraid of them? \\"It depends on the monster,\\" he says, \\"if it`s a real one or not and if it's where I am.\\"  Emma Donoghue's decision to tell a story of cruelty and imagination, not from the perpetrator's or adult caretaker's point of view, but from a child's perspective, has put *Room* on the short list (one of six finalists) for this year's Man Booker Prize (the British Commonwealth's version of the Pulitzer for fiction).  Donoghue includes too many Britishisms for a story set in the States -- have a go, keen, tricksy, poo -- and one plot development seems underprepared for. But when it comes to how a child's mind works and then grows more like an adult's, Donoghue has thought of everything. *Room* recalls the value of our childlike perceptions.  The story of Jack and Ma is clap-hands funny and wet-face sad. It's asurprising flipperoo.
B003QCCS36|5.0|As a long time lover of his work this album is yet another wonderful surprise.   He seems to know exactly where people's hearts are and turn it to mush, rebuild it and tear it down again.   Unlike many other musicians you believe every single word he sings. it's as if the beat of his songs is a mirror of his own heart pumping and breaking.  Such a lovey artist.   This album seems a logical progression of his music. I don't really have a favourite album since all his work is outstanding and this one's no exception.  Personal favourites are Like Rock & Roll and radio, and This love is over. But hearing Repo man just brings a smile to my face.    It's almost a crime not to have atleast one album of Lamontagne in your collection. and those who haven't been to his concert before, my god you're in for an emotional rollercoaster like you've never thought possible. Ray hits every button in your body, and even button's you never knew you had.
0618918248|5.0|Dawkins brilliantly makes the case that 'knowing' that a God exists, that a God can be logically attributed to anything in reality, and that a blind belief in Godly authority are all detrimental to human civilization. Irrespective of our own personal views the facts behind his premise are undeniable.
B001KR0BDI|3.0|This book seems more adult than YA.  I kept expecting Katsa to change her mind about marriage after she fell in love but she didn't and it was very disappointing.  I can accept that though since it is such a prevalent attitude in our society now.  What I didn't like was what happened to Po in the end.  It seems unnecessary to furthering the plot and was just a downer.  And it made the end of the story drag on past the big climatic moment.  I really don't like it when authors write good stories with bad endings.  Especially when it doesn't really seem to fit with the rest of the story.  That's why I rate this book 3 stars.  If the ending had been better I would have rated it 5 stars.  I don't think I will buy any more books from this author.  I can't trust her to write a story I will like all the way to the end.  This book just wasted my time.

0553805371|2.0|This is an attractive glossy book, but irritatingly simplistic, and worse, outdated - it could well have been written ten years ago.  Egregiously missing are any mentions - even to challenge them - of Bell's Theorem, Alain Aspect, quantum entanglement and nonlocality, and the radical reinvisioning of physics, and indeed our world view, that these developments have necessitated.
B003EYVY04|1.0|And WHAT HAPPENED with the EXTENDED VERSION I was soooooo looking forward for the Ultimate Edition of the Prisoner of Azkaban and the Goble of Fire in its extended versions.... SOOOOOOO disappointed when I saw that what we get instead is a \\"nice poster of the movie\\" instead... Why WB tries to sale us something that we already have? only because it has a new documentary DVD and a bunch of useless stuffs... and what happened with the Extended version of the movie??? that was the coolest thing about this Ultimate Editions... unless WB is thinking in a near future to try to sale us the extended versions of this movies in a \\"NEW PLATINUM VERSION\\" or something like that... this is an Item that I will NEVER buy...
0553805371|1.0|First, let me just say, it was a big let down for me but it was only two-hundred pages so \\"The Grand Design\\" although not so grand, and I got it for half price, was a quick and somewhat interesting read, although he followed Carl Sagan's design, in The Dragons of Eden.  On the other hand, it wasn't complicated, and he got into the history of things--where this theory and that theory came from, had he not done that, the book would have only been sixty-pages; that part was somewhat old, but still interesting, yet where the design was that threw God out of the picture, I lost it.  Here I was looking for the death of God, and found God made more than one Universe, by gosh, he created a larger supreme being than I had ever imagined. Where this proof is, he never really tells you, he kind of goes around in circles, drops a few concepts, theories, ones we all kind of know or heard about, but leaves it up to us to believe that his end predict will do what he says it will do: eliminate God; and here I'm trying to connect gravity and Electromagnetism,  and a weak nuclear force, and a strong nuclear force, and so forth and connect all these dots, and were are we after I turn the last page, back to where we started; he does  put an alien here and there gives some science fiction writers some data to use on their next short stories in mathematics and quantum theories, but God is still alive.  The Design of his new universe is somewhat there, and the ones behind ours and all those other ones, that he just briefly mentions are out there, we have to take him at his word, it's called faith, in that he knows what he's talking about; so,  as these universes expand, they kind of recreate themselves, like the aliens are trying to do by snatching  humanity's women and trying to clone themselves (this is of course my interpretation of his cloning process for the universes out there we never knew we had, but with his theory).  I'm just going on and on because I wanted to read somethingconcrete for once in a science book that doses what the author says it is suppose to do; he does draw his support from folks like Sagan and Darwin, but they've not proven anything concrete either; he kind of downgrades Einstein for accepting God as the sum of all things, and gives him credit for starting the ball rolling but I get the impression, he thinks he's wiser than Einstein (who's to say?).  Anyhow, I read his Black Hole book, again a theory, but better than this one.  DLS
B000V6I7WG|4.0|When I mentioned to a friend last week that I had just watched and liked [[ASIN:B003T6LIBM The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]], he suggested that if I like stories of mystery, murder and revenge that I ought to try Old Boy. So from Sweden to South Korea I went this weekend, and my friend was right, Old Boy was quite good. (But I think that I've filled my quota for subtitled movies for the year.)<br /><br />While a little over the top and bizarre at times, Old Boy is one of the more original and diabolical stories that I've seen in a while. Your name is Dae-su and you've been kidnapped off the streets one day to find yourself locked in a room with no explanation for why you're being held captive. No one communicates with you other than a TV set that has been placed in the room and your only contact with anyone is a daily serving of dumplings pushed through a small opening in the locked door. Now imagine that several years of this pass and there's still no explanation for your captivity.<br /><br />Would you go nuts? Or would you spend every day wishing and preparing for release so that you could exact revenge on your captors? Be careful what you wish for, because being locked in a room for the rest of your life could turn out to be a better option if your captor releases you and your imprisonment was only the beginning of your torment. \\"Laugh, and the world laughs with you. Weep, and you weep alone.\\" Baloney! Ask Dae-su how he feels about that inspirational poster.<br /><br />Old Boy is darkly amusing at times, but mostly genuinely disturbing. Importantly, it was thoroughly entertaining. It had enough action and the twists and turns came frequently enough to prevent any boredom. Definitely worth reading 2 hours of subtitles.
0156030306|5.0|This is absolutely one of the best books I have ever read (twice). I first had to read it sometime in high school or junior high for English class and it is the first time I remember staying up almost all night to finish a book (literally \\"couldn't put it down\\" as they always say), and the first time I remember crying after reading a book (still doesn't happen often - see Steinbeck's 'East of Eden' for an exception!). I dared to pick it up again a couple years ago (while studying neuroscience no less) and found my childhood praise vindicated.<br /><br />Briefly (others have summarized it well), the story follows Charlie Gordon, a mentally handicapped ('retarded' in the parlance of the time) man in his thirties, who becomes the subject of a radical neurological procedure which raises his IQ to normal levels - and then far, far beyond. A mouse (the eponymous 'Algernon') undergoes the same procedure simultaneously and the experimenters keep tabs on both of them.<br /><br />The genius of the book is that it is told in first-person 'logs' that Charlie is made to keep by the experimenters. Thus, in a way we know only what Gordon knows (as per the first-person medium), but at the same time we know so much more (or less), and here the book succeeds very well on an intellectual and emotional level. Throughout the first part, we witness Charlie being taunted and abused and not even knowing it, and it's heart-wrenching. Later in the book he becomes a super-genius of sorts, and the reader can hardly keep up with his theories of brain function derived from the Japanese neurological community (all fictional of course - but, though I can't remember the scientific details anymore, for what it's worth it all seemed very interesting and even semi-plausible to me when I read it last and was in the midst of studying very similar research in school).<br /><br />Besides being intellectually interesting and emotionally stimulating, we get the roller-coaster ride of a man waking up to the world in a matter of days, suddenly discovering art, music, women, science, and his own morbid past - to say nothing of his terrifying future.<br /><br />The ending is heart-breaking and beautifully done, though I don't wish to spoil anything. Just writing this review I'm determined to find another copy of this book and read it again - I gave mine away to a friend.<br /><br />I feel this review has been utterly insufficient, so let me just say that this is an exceptional book and should most definitely be given a read. I've looked at the negative reviews on here, they appear to all have been written by bored, boring high school students.

B003YY7BTW|1.0|Ok, so I am a big buff for little stupid romantic comedies, but JLo's hair was the hair style you would see on the \\"auntie\\"  She is aged in this film, flat, and not sparky.  The whole movie was sad, I did not even wait for it to finish.  I was very disappointed.  The hair set the tone for the film, which depicted bad casting, bad play, and most of all bad stylist.  The film was really really bad.  So bad, I left a movie review!

This is about a man who bonds with this dog and keeps the bond thru out !<br /><br />The story is a well woven Koontz presentation and my personal favorite!  It takes the reader by the hand and that person becomes a part of the drama and the challenges.  This is not a book to read on a busy weekend. This is one where the reader has no plans and wants to be entertained.<br /><br />This is a great story with a beautiful animal, a little romance and a great book about how love conquers all!<br /><br />Enjoy-
0786956291|3.0|I played D&D as a kid and they got me with the nostalgic red box! It's been over 20 years since I played D&D, but I recently started playing again with my kids. I had never DM'd a game before so I bought the 2006 Basic Game Boxed Set (3.5 rules). That set was awesome at getting me back up to speed and back into the game. The set came with 12 miniatures, great quality card-stock dungeon tiles, and a very good adventure to take you into 2nd level. Both me and the kids loved it. So I bought this new set with an interest of switching to 4e rules. Bottom line - compared to the 2006 set this is a disappointment. The adventure is not as well laid out, it starts with a focus on a solo adventure then switches to a multi-player adventure. It hop around a lot and is in a less linear format, which makes it harder to pick up quickly and easily. There are no miniatures included in this set (my kids REALLY like having the miniatures when playing) and it replaces them with round card-stock tokens. The map is a foldout instead of tiles, and is just not as sturdy. All that said - the price is reasonable for what you get, and it does help get you up to speed on the 4e rules. If you are set on playing 4e go for it, but compared the the quality of the 2006 set this one just does not stand up.

B000UJCALI|5.0|Stanley Kubrick does horror.  The Shining is more of a Kubrick film than a horror film but that's no complaint.  Jack Nicholson is an unbalanced writer who plans to spend a winter as a caretaker of a Colorado hotel that will be closed off from the outside world.  Scenes of impending doom and a haunted house fill out the rest of the story with a mention of the title.  The Shining is a form of telepathy that the little boy has to communicate with another world.  Shelly Duvall makes a great mom and is a wonderful actress.
B000KJU1MS|5.0|was a very good dvd. i enjoyed it very much. can't wait to get part 2.
B00006AUIG|2.0|It starts off bad from the start. We are introduced to a bunch of characters, but it feels as though the movie left out the part where we were actually introduced to them. They are talking about and referring to things that the audience has no clue about, yet the film acts as though we are supposed to. The point is that we are supposed to piece things together and at the end of the story, a dark secret will be revealed, but it really isn't an effective way to start off a movie. I don't want to be confused from the get go, especially in a mindless horror film.<br />should you choose to watch it against my advice, Session 9 is a character movie, just without character.<br /><br />In terms of horror, Session 9 has very little. Most of the movie takes place during the day, and the climax even takes place in daylight. The creepiest part of the movie, where one of the workers is pursued down a pitch black corridor by someone or something, only lasts for a minute. There isn't anything even remotely exciting in the whole film.<br /><br />he only interesting part of Session 9 is the small storyline where one of the workers listens to a bunch of old tapes of a psychologist interviewing a woman who has multiple personalities, one of which is a killer. Listening to the tapes was truly creepy, and also grabbed my attention. Strangely enough, these tapes are where the movie gets its title from (\\"Session 9\\" is the interview number with the patient), but the story the tapes tell never gets incorporated into the movie. I see where the screenwriter was trying to go with it, but I didn't see much of a connection.<br /><br />By the end of the movie, I had already made up my mind. Session 9 is an utterly bad movie without much going for it. I have to admit that I was impressed by the little twist at the end, but by that point, the movie had lost.<br /><br />If you want to see Session 9, change your mind.
0743270754|5.0|I received great insights into this time in our history and more specifically the lives of the major characters in the election issues of the 1860's.  Lincoln was surely a genius in the presentation of himself as he perceived the importance of issues that were so devastationally devisive.  Great writing on Goodwin's part........  Her thorough research in the personalities was in evidence.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|So I'm going to keep this short and sweet.  This headset rocks. Its loud, clear, and sounds great! Very easy to set up. The volume controls are clearly marked and easy to use. Its great to be able to adjust the chat volume without affecting the game volume or vice versa.  There is more than enough cable for people that sit further away from their TVs. Also, the mic monitoring is great and allows me to hear myself when I start getting too loud.  Only 2 complaints. The volume controls get bumped by my arm sometimes and the cable is a bit heavy and pulls the in-line amp off my shorts (it has a clip on the back to clip on to shirt or pants) and it ends up falling off. When I clip it to my shirt, its no problem though.    All in all, if you need a good set of headphones and a headset to communicate with, order the Turtle Beach Ear Force PX21 Gaming Headset   RIGHT NOW!
0739367676|5.0|I have listened to the entire Twilight Saga on CD. The primary reader, Ilyana Kadushin, is one of the best I have ever heard (and I have listened to hundreds of books on tape and CD). The love story and the conflict of good versus evil are brought to life by her exquisite character portrayals.
B0001611DI|5.0|This was a great movie, good acting, the blood was a too bright to be realistic and the make-up for the zombies were pretty simple.  But eventually it doesnt even matter, because as soon as they get to the mall it has you hooked.  Usually I have a problem with movies that have slow walking zombies because its not scary, just walk pass them, thats it, running zombies thats something different. But in this, Romero did good job(of course) showing what they do in numbers, so I was cool with it.  Tom Savini has a little role which was cool, overall great zombie movie!
B000069KIZ|5.0|This is one of the best recordings of Brahms symphonies ever...from the first to the fourth Bohm's inspiring direction makes you feel that his perfomance is just the right, without being pompous or just exagerated. Abbado's are very good, as are Karajan's on his own, but for some reason I always back to Bohm's. The sound is terrific, despite of being an analog recording, and sometimes I got the impression that it is even better than the Abbado's digital recordings. For the price (and the work itself) I assure you that this CD will be among your favorites.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|DVD arrived 3 days after release (I had pre-ordered it) with free shipping.   Five stars to Amazon and to the show.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I bought this full series box of Dr Quinn because although I watched the show when it was on TV, my children were small at the time and I missed many episodes and never got to see the last few seasons. When I received my DVDs I started with the Pilot 2 hour episode and I am up to season 3 now. It is a wonderfully wholesome show that the entire family can watch and enjoy. It has action and adventure as well as a touch of romance. Each episode contains some sort of positive message and a happy ending, something that you don't see a lot of from television these days. And even though sometimes I would love to strangle some of the towns' people in the show, by the end of the program, with a little nudging from Dr. Mike, their compassionate sides do come to the forefront. I think that anyone who has never seen the show will love it from the very first episode and find it quite hard to turn off and anyone who has seen it before will truly enjoy watching from the first DVD to the last.
B003L77G6A|5.0|In the cult tradition of SPARTACUS, the halls of every science department now echoes: &#34;I AM SHELDON&#34;!<br /><br />Currently into its fourth season, THE BIG BANG THEORY proved to be one of the most funny TV sitcoms ever aired. I had not laughed out loud this hard ever since the best days of FRASIER and SEINFELD - and BIG BANG is **consistently** brilliant!<br /><br />Sheldon Cooper is unavoidably the king of the show - the massive black hole this Universe revolves around if you will. A child prodigy, now a 24 years old theoretical physicist PhD with absolutely no social skills or known sexual drive. Sheldon may be on the verge of unifying the fields but cannot drive a car to save his life or break a smile even remotely resembling that of a mere homo sapiens.<br />And now, he starts going out on dates...Well, sort off. He still cannot drive and yet his fusion into Shamy may produce what can only be described as the...Kwisatz Haderach!<br />(On a more sober note: producers please get rid of Amy, she only gums up the show's flow!)<br /><br />Leonard Hofstadter is Sheldon's roommate and primary ...keeper. An experimental physicist himself, he juggles Sheldon's idiosyncrasies with his personal neurosis - not to mention his crush on his neighbor Penny. Which crush, like lunar eclipses, follow a predicted yet unavoidable periodicity.<br /><br />Howard Wolowitz is the only one with no PhD yet (and Sheldon never lets him forget it). An electrical engineer whose crowning achievement is a mechanized arm that is used in the space shuttle (and is now working on its liquid waste management solutions). He also managed to wreck the Mars rover in hopes of landing a girl - but he made sure no one can prove anything.<br />The fact that he is a short man with a severely outdated and misguided sense of fashion, still lives with his mother, insists on using a collection of pickup lines straight from men's magazines advice columns - and yet carries himself as God's gift to women is just hilarious.<br />Now, if only he could find a practical use for that mechanized arm...<br /><br />Rajesh Koothrappali is a particle astrophysicist with a fashion sense close to absolute zero and a severe case of shyness - to the point that he cannot speak in front of women unless inebriated. He keeps using the &#34;poor Indian&#34; defense although his father is a rich doctor who drives a Bentley.<br /><br />Finally, Penny. She is the proverbial good girl next door who came to California with stardom aspirations but so far works as waitress and suffers a sequence of bad boyfriends (Sheldon has in fact calculated the exact number of them, extrapolated from a bell-curve that started at 14)- and, obviously, from her neighbors.<br /><br />The show unavoidably makes use of previous sitcom combinations (the odd couple, the unfulfilled love-interest mismatch) but even if one manages to discern them they are used in such a fresh manner that all that is left is great entertainment!<br /><br />The way to truly enjoy this is to own it on DVD. The writing is so smart and the jokes fly so fast (many of them non-verbal) there is just no way to savor it during its weekly air time. Well, may be Sheldon could but then again, who can compare his intellect with his?<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!just hilarious.<br />Now, if only he could find a practical use for that mechanized arm...<br /><br />Rajesh Koothrappali is a particle astrophysicist with a fashion sense close to absolute zero and a severe case of shyness - to the point that he cannot speak in front of women unless inebriated.

B003V5PPZG|5.0|Like each of their albums, I have found myself addicted to their latest effort.<br /><br />With A Thousand Suns, a lot of people have written LP off completely after this release which I don't think is fear. A concept album is a departure but doesn't mean the death of the band's mainstay sound. Though, with the next album, don't expect a big leap back to Hybrid Theory. Those days are over even though most fans want it. Go figure. The making of the first album was around 12 years ago with songs developed years before that. They were different guys, they were much younger. Can't expect maturity to elude them. So yes, we will continue to see progression, but let's hope they at least return to \\"rock\\". Rock, this album is not. In fact, looking for the sound of a guitar strum may prove too much of a challenge. There are some of Chester's rock vocals (a few samples of screaming) but this album is mostly smooth mellow vocals from Chester, some rapping and singing from Mike and a whole lot of electronics. There's no way to really classify this album into a genre. At least it stays true to their original theory - which is hybrid music.<br /><br />I don't want to look at this album and say...\\"well, this is Linkin Park, if it ain't heavy nu-metal, then it sucks\\". I like all forms of music and can appreciate the softer side of Linkin Park. Metal heads can't appreciate such variety so they need to look elsewhere. For open minded listeners, there's a lot to love here.<br /><br />Here's a quick opinion break down of the tracks...The 9 real songs are rated<br /><br />1. The Requiem.................A nice short opening using The Catalyst lyrics led by a female vocalist<br />2. The Radiance................another short instrumental lead in<br />3. Burning In The Skies........For the lead song, not among the strongest. Actually it's among the weakest here. Still, a decent, smooth, mellow tune 4/5<br />4. Empty Spaces................18 seconds of war sound effects.<br />5. When They Come For Me.......Album finally starts up. A great mix of styles and harmonies. 5/5<br />6. Robot Boy...................IMO, the album's masterpiece. A highly produced, smooth flowing epic 5/5<br />7. Jornada Del Muerto..........a 1:30 interlude,very soft and slow with modified vocals<br />8. Waiting For The End.........Mike and Chester share vocals in a relatively mid-tempo standard song. A notch better than #3 4/5<br />9. Blackout....................Easily the most energetic song. Big beats, Mike's signature rapping, and Chester's signature screaming. 5/5<br />10. Wretches And Kings.........Traditional LP rap/sing mix by Mike and Chester but managing to stand by itself as a very original sounding song 5/5<br />11. Wisdom, Justice, And Love..Famous speech quotes set to music<br />12. Iridescent.................Another soft, smooth, ballad that builds up to mid-tempo 4/5<br />13. Fallout....................1:23 of abstract electronic vocals - very slow<br />14. The Catalyst...............The lead single. Doesn't need much review. But I love it. Very original and an epic. 5/5<br />15. The Messenger..............This highly synthesized electronic album ends with this odd surprise - a rough acoustic ballad sung by Chester. 3/5<br /><br />So for those that are disgusted, don't fret. Linkin Park is far from dead. This is a middle of the road experiment.<br /><br />Simply the best album of the year. 5 Stars.
B003ELOQD4|2.0|I have never seen U2 in concert but I do own all their DVD concerts. U2 live at the Rose Bowl is the first one I bought in the Blu-Ray format and I am very disappointed in the sound. I have a dedicated surround sound room that is set up for 7.1 and this concert has barely any bass coming from my subwoofer. A couple of times it comes in for a few seconds during It's A Beautiful Day and in part of Elevation but the rest of the concert has no body. I am tempted to buy the regular DVD version to see if it sounds any better. I do like the set list as a lot are from the new album but that is the only good thing about this release.[[ASIN:B003ELOQD4 U2: 360° at the Rose Bowl [Blu-ray]]]

B003JTHESA|5.0|I hadn't purchased an Iron Maiden CD in a long time.  Recently, I started listening to them again.  I have actually seen them in concert two times...Once on the Powerslave Tour (Live After Death CD) and then the Somewhere in Time Tour that followed.  Well, this new CD is a must have for any Maiden fan...I cannot stop listening to it.  As far as I am concerned, it is as good or better than Powerslave.  For a band that is in their 50's, they certainly aren't sitting around letting the dust collect.  I recommend this CD to anyone who is a past or current Maiden fan, you won't be disappointed.
B000PDYVVG|1.0|I wanted to read this book, but I refuse to pay $12.99 for an ebook.  The cost of producing an ebook is negligble, and sales can be astronomical, if priced appropriately.  I WILL NOT pay and inflated price for a book.  I don't want to read it that badly.  Publishers need to get a clue and realize they are losing profits by overpricing their product.  I could begin boycotting publishers who insist on this kind of pricing.  I have over 500 books on my kindle, and continue to add to it on a regular basis.  But I won't be buying this.  I wonder if the pdf is available online yet.  I'm not in favor of piracy, but this kind of business practice gives me a better understanding of those who are.

B0036TGSIK|5.0|I'm the kind of fellow who would view a foreign film with subtitles than watch a formulaic Hollywood production.  But on a recommendation, I went to see this movie, and my time was not wasted.  The reason it works so well is that the star Emma Stone (as Olive Penderghast) naturally communicates intelligence, charm, and old fashioned girl charisma. By the end of the film, we're not sure whether we want her as a virgin..or not.    Now that we are in the 21st century, the meaning of Hawthorne's \\"Scarlet Letter\\" - the \\"A\\" - which stands for adultery is far less scandalous.  So when Olive daringly sews such a letter on her dress (over her breast, no less) she communicates a vibrant sexuality. But is that good or bad?    Our heroine is going to high school in a conservative part of Southern California. When Olive tells a white lie that she had a teenage affair, voila...she becomes the \\"gossip of the day\\";  Suddenly this reclusive girl becomes the one female that everyone notices.  Being of good heart - as opposed to her fundamentalist Christian nemesis - she uses this new power to help others' reputations, such as a gay student who is constantly bullied for being so.  (The scene where she misleads her classmates to believe she is having 'wild sex\\" with the gay fellow is hilarious).     The themes of the movie - how society perceives sexuality -  how an individual develops a sense of self worth = are important ones.  And those themes are handled fluidly by the good ensemble cast. For example, Stanley Tucci as her liberal minded parent is a hoot. (When her mom says that she is starting to look like a hooker, her dad remarks, yes...but a high class hooker.  I guess most of us don't have parents \\"that\\" open minded.)   So for those who \\"hate\\" teen comedies...you may be making a mistake by missing this one.
B001KVZ6F2|3.0|Clint Eastwood is a powerful presence in this film, as Walt Kowalsky, an elderly Korean war veteran trapped in his hyper-masculine, racist, emotionally bared down persona. He is a widower, lonely, seeks refuge in his Gran Torino sports car and practical domestic tasks. He oozes growling, simmering fury at the invasion of his neighbourhood by Asian families 'Gooks, eggrolls, Charlie Chans'.<br /><br />The plot is a sort of grand redemption, road to calvary message as Walt finds himself unwillingly ensnared in the lives of the Korean youngsters next door to him, in particular Thao, a young man who initially tries to steal his car but emerges as a vulnerable youth in need of work and a father figure which Walt provides in his brusque, no-nonsense way (including a great scene where he educates the young Korean in savage, ball busting banter with his local Argentinian barber).<br /><br />As the tension develops, Walt, with his finger always metaphorically if not literally on the trigger of one of the guns he keeps in his bedroom, takes on a local gang of Asians with a much nastier tone than the ones in his immediate neighbourhood. He becomes a sort of white man protector figure, a chiselled, classical, superannuated hero who uses his old fashioned virtues to one last effect to save the new immigrant influx. The result is powerful, if a little simplistic, with bombast and symbolism overwhelming much subtlety.<br /><br />This film is noteworthy for being, supposedly, Eastwood's last screen role. And the finale perhaps gains a little resonance from that fact.
0553805371|4.0|Renowned physicist Stephen Hawking's first book on the nature of the universe,   \\"A Brief History of Time\\",  is often described as the `most purchased, but least   read' of any recent best seller. His newest publishing success, \\"A Grand Design\\"   poses two grand questions, \\"Why is there something rather than nothing?\\"  and   \\"Does the Universe Need a Creator?\\"  This time Hawking provides text in language   that for the most part can be understood by readers without a background in   physics and chemistry. So Grand Design should achieve a higher percentage of   actual readers. But the logic of his answers to those two questions is a   challenge, even to those of us with some background in the sciences.    Hawking takes us on a readable tour of the science involved in the way that   countless stars and galaxies are formed from primordial masses of hydrogen. He   argues that for the universe Beginning, this original material emerges   spontaneously from quantum fluctuations like tiny expanding bubbles, some of   which grow to form stars and galaxies. This spontaneous creation is apparently   possible because the law of gravity requires a lot of negative energy, the   something needed to oppose gravity's positive force. All this then is the   substance for the matter in the universe, obviating the need for God.    I'm sure that I have missed the most subtle elements in Hawking's theory, but   it still seems like some of our legislative laws which often decree nonexistent   savings or revenue.    Another explanation for something rather than nothing comes from the scholar   scribes who wrote the book of Genesis. They probably meant longer times for each   of the momentous events involved in creation than the 24 hours it takes for the   earth to make a revolution.  If we translate that time to a word like era or   epoch, those first 24 verses of the Book of Genesis read as an oversimplified,   but rather elegant, geology text - perhaps as convincing an explanation for the   Beginning as Professor Hawking's grand design.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|The first of the 2000s were not kind to Ben Affleck.  After emerging as an actor with some promise in the late 1990s, including an Academy Award for screenwriting, the new Millenium offered up a series of disappointments:  bad or mediocre role choices, the tabloid media spectacle of \\"Bennifer\\", and ultimately massive overexposure leading to his becoming a punchline (best friend Matt Damon, meanwhile, only kept getting bigger).  I was one of those who thought he had little to offer by mid-decade.  But at that point, he started to turn things around professionally, as an actor and, with the release in 2007 of the brilliant \\"Gone Baby, Gone\\", as a director.  With \\"The Town\\", his second feature as a director, he proves that it wasn't just a flash in the pan.  Spoilers follow.    Based on the novel \\"Prince of Thieves\\" by Chuck Hogan, the setup and a lot of the story here is rather familiar:  Our protagonist is a criminal, born into a life of crime, and is discontentedly looking for a way out of a world that offers nothing but dead ends, but feels bound alternately by threats and his close family ties.  In this case, our main character is Doug McRay (Affleck himself; his brother Casey was busy making a fake documentary about Joaquin Phoenix), the leader of a four-person bank-robbing crew that includes his best friend Jem (\\"The Hurt Locker\\"'s Jeremy Renner) and two other disposable guys.  They pull heists for Fergie (Pete Postlethwaite), an old-timer who worked with their fathers.  Jem's sister Krista (Blake Lively) is Doug's sometime squeeze, and would like to be more, but Doug is more interested in Claire (Rebecca Hall, again taking her fake American accent out for a spin), the manager of a bank that the boys rob.  And FBI special agent Adam Frawley (\\"Mad Men\\"'s Jon Hamm) is on the McRay crew's case.    The close-knit ethnic crime ring (Irish, in this case; the last decade has seen a burgeoning subgenre of Boston Irish crime films to counter the traditional supremacy ofNew York Italians) where loyalty is everything is a film staple, as is the criminal lured toward the good side by the prospect of a good relationship.  But originality isn't everything (there are only so many truly original stories, after all), particularly when you execute your story as well as Affleck does here.  While the film isn't as emotional or dark as \\"Gone Baby, Gone\\", every shot and decision is confidently made; the cast and crew know what they're doing, and Affleck delivers some tense gun battles and car chases, two cinematic staples that under many directors come across as quite rote.  And Affleck the screenwriter (and the novel it's based on) smartly strike a balance between the redemptive and the realistic in crafting the ending - it is nice, incidentally, to see a crime film aimed at adults that doesn't subscribe to the idea that a completely bleak ending is the only 'realistic' option.    The performances are all up to the material.  Affleck the director and screenwriter gives Affleck the actor everything necessary to bring a well-realized character to the screen.  Jeremy Renner is a real livewire, and easily steals the show as Jem, who is easily led to violence but whose hair-trigger is not quite so fine as many movie psychos (refreshing; you wonder why anyone would ever keep Joe Pesci around in most of his movies).  Jon Hamm, so brilliant on \\"Mad Men\\", takes the standard role of the dogged cop and makes it work (Frawley is the straight arrow that Don Draper only resembles).  Among the women, both Hall and Lively do well; Lively's work here should definitely earn her some credibility as an actress, while Hall continues her series of fine performances (one is constantly waiting for her to get a real breakthrough role).  Postlethwaite and Chris Cooper (as Doug's father) have good cameo roles.    Recommended.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Amazing and wonderful experience in contrast to the traditional video games; the new PS3 offers you exciting reasons to buy it. Hundred of titles, from strategies to sports, are available for enjoy them.  It is highly recommended...!
B003HFFVDQ|2.0|Purchased with the expectation of enjoying it as much as all of the other Chemical Bros Music that I have. I was very disappointed and My wife who absolutely loves the Chemical Bros can't stand this new work.
7119005901|1.0|This is the most difficult to read book I have ever read. I mean this literally. I am not talking about the reading level or the quality of the translation. The pages are the thinnest I have ever seen in a book. You can clearly see the text from the other pages quite clearly. The low contrast makes the page literally difficult to read. I know they did this to cut costs, but this is stupid if you can't even read the book. I would have rather paid an extra 10 to 20 dollars for some thicker pages and an extra volume. Try and find a better version if you can.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I do not give out a 5 star review often. Records like this do not come around as often as many of us would hope. I will say that I expected the songs to be good because of the well deserved buzz they have received, but the songs are not just good, they are of the highest quality in writing, rhythm, and emotion. If you are at all interested in hearing a band that reflects on things like life, death, selfishness, regret, healing and truth-- then consider this one.<br /><br />This album is brave, honest, and will have your fist pumping as you sing out along to the chorus.<br /><br />Don't miss this one.<br /><br />For Fans of: Fleet Foxes, Elbow, Bob Dylan, Jose Gonzales, Bon Iver, Sigur Ros, Arcade Fire, The National etc.
B003V5PPZG|1.0|Didn't care for their third album, but I thought I would give them another chance with their latest release.    Sadly, this is another disappointment.  The Catalyst sounded like something I'd hear at Ministry of Sound or something.  The beats were just completely in the wrong place.    Honestly, just stick with Hybrid Theory and Meteora.  I don't think Linkin Park will ever get their act together, unless this album bombs harder than the atomic bomb.
193413712X|4.0|This book is difficult to read at times and somewhat chaotic at first but it beautifully describes the random thoughts of a dying man as he reviews his life. The writing is beautiful and I found many parts that I re-read many times. It deals with time: passing time, wasted time, and the symbolism of the clock winding down our lives. The book may not be for everyone but it is full of very good writing and is very thought provoking.
B003V5PPZG|3.0|I wasn't expecting this at all. I was expecting a good follow up to Minutes to Midnight. However, there a some great songs on this cd like Burning in the skies, irdescent, and waiting for the end.  This is very a techno Linkin Park, very limited Brad Delson and his guitars. Either you will love it or hate it..
0439023483|5.0|This wonderful book (and its sequels) have done three prominent things: One, made me cry. Two, Made me laugh. three, made it onto my top ten series list. The Hunger Games, Catching Fire, and -of course- Mockingjay, are absolutely a trilogy that I would reccommend. There are a few things that you should know before buying/ reading this book, though. First, these books are dark. Very dark. There is lots (and lots and lots) of killing, murdering, poisoning, torturing, mutilating, etc.(I'm not even going to go into what happens in Mockingjay)! Second, these books also have romance. Mind you, there is nothing more than in the frist three books of twilight, so if you've read those, you're safe. Okay, so to wrap up my review, i'll tell you some books I would reccommend if you like this book, or it sound a little too scary for your likes. First and Foremost, HARRY POTTER. If you haven't read it, READ IT READ IT READ IT! Second, Suzanne Collins' other books, The Overlander series, is a great read. i think there are around... 6? I don't know. If The Hunger Games sounds too dark, Gregor the Overlander is good. A third and final series I reccommend is the Fablehaven series. these books are kind o like the Harry Potter books in the way it tells about another world that Coincides with our world.<br /><br />Well... I had no idea I had written this much! if you took the time to read this insignificant 7th grade Luna Lovegood fan's review of The Hunger Games, Thank you kind person! :D Ciao!
B0002VEX7S|4.0|I have collected Loreena McKennitt's work for years but have not written about it until now. IMO this album is one of her best efforts; the concert DVD adds to its appeal.<br /><br />IMO Ms. McKennitt has a unique view of Celtic music. She knows its long history and influence, which has traveled far beyond its misty British roots. Moreover, she has the musical talent to illuminate its traditional songs with new meaning; the artistic maturity to create original works within the genre, infused by her travels around the Celtic diaspora -- and the intelligence to market herself and her vision with class. Therefore, it is no surprise that her career and popularity continue to grow.<br /><br />Technically this product works well in presenting the artist at her best. The live recordings are clear and sharp; so is the concert DVD, which has been nicely shot and edited.<br /><br />I can think of no finer way to spend a wintry evening than with a roaring fire, a glass of wine and Ms. KcKennett's achingly beautiful voice and music to whisk me away to other lands and times.
B003B1X80Y|5.0|Great movie.   Excelent casting, very good script and story.  Some things same simples however hide deep feelings.       A story about the truly love of a human been.   A film for keep in your memory for long time.
0439023491|4.0|This review has also been published on my book blog, Ten Cent Notes. ([...])<br /><br />After winning the Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark are back at home in District 12. Living in her new home in Victor's Village and richer than she could have previously managed, Katniss' life should be perfect. But because of her, uh, unorthodox solution to surviving the Games, she's on President Snow's short list. While Peeta's affections for her are obvious and undying, Snow doesn't quite believe that what Katniss did was prompted entirely by love. Apparently some of the other districts -- the larger, more desperate ones -- are beginning to act out in rebellion, and Katniss is the unwitting symbol of this rebellion.<br /><br />And while Katniss is trying to convince President Snow of her great love for Peeta Mellark, aware that any uprisings in the surrounding districts will be pinned on her, the Hunger Games are once again afoot. And, as the third Quarter Quell, this Game comes with specific instructions -- ones that drag Katniss even closer to the danger around her.<br /><br />The setting here is, as it was in the first novel, pretty amazing. Collins really does a brilliant job of world-building in this trilogy, and Katniss' new living situation comes at a sharp contrast from the poverty she endured during the first book. Themes here are different but just as pronounced as in the previous book. Instead of her own survival, Katniss is suddenly worried about Gale, Peeta, and her family's survival. Her own life means nothing if she can't protect the ones she loves. The plot moves quickly, covering much more space than the first book and though nothing important is left out, it does leave the reader (in this case me) wondering about all the things we don't know that happened in the large chunk of time the book covers. The ending is surprising and -- though I rarely say this -- completely out of nowhere. I'm so glad to have the last book in the series because otherwise I would be going crazy right now.<br /><br />The one real problem I had with this book was Katniss. While many of the other characters -- Peeta especially -- were incredible, Katniss disappointed. In the first installment we saw her develop into a very multi-dimensional character, full of loyalty and love even in the midst of a horrific battle. She was smart, savvy, and although her situation was despicable, it was easy to root for her. In CATCHING FIRE, however, this spark seems missing. She comes across as not quite know what she feels or what she wants, and as a result ends up acting oblivious and incredibly distrusting even of those who are obviously on her side. Her choice between her own life and a rebellion is a difficult one, but the fact that she seemed to constantly be going back and forth on this (and other issues -- see: Gale, Peeta) was annoying and definitely didn't endear me to her. By the end of the book -- especially in the end of the book -- I wasn't quite sure what to make of Katniss. I wanted to like her, but ultimately I didn't. I'm really hoping that the Katniss from book one will be back in the last installment.<br /><br />Overall, the second book in the Hunger Games trilogy felt exactly like the second book in a trilogy. An exceptionally well-executed second book, with an incredible premise, themes, setting, and surprise ending, but still a second book... a link between the set-up of the first and the punchline (so to speak) of the last.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|Good Movie from beginning to end,non stop action.This is how the star trek crew got started,not really how you expected!!!
0439023513|5.0|This review has also been posted to my book blog, Ten Cent Notes. ([...])    Looking at MOCKINGJAY objectively is going to be nearly impossible. For me, for you, for anyone, I think, if only because it's such an emotional novel. Love it or hate it, there's no way to get through these four hundred pages unscathed, without having some sort of extreme emotional reaction. Some have said this book broke their brain. Others describe it as the Mockingjay hangover or Post-Traumatic-Mockingjay-Disorder.    Yes. I am writing this the day after finishing the book and I agree with the above. It broke my brain. I'm in a post-Mockingjay haze and attempting to write a review. So please, bear with me.    First, as if the extraordinarily high score above wasn't clue enough, you should know that I love this book. I think it's brilliant, I think it ended the trilogy perfectly, and in fact I think it was the best of the bunch. I love it so much that a mere 10 of 10 seems like a low score. Honestly, I wish I could break the rules of math and give it a 12 on the \\"fangirly\\" scale.    Of course the premise and plot are continuations of the first two books in the series, but this time things are different. Katniss Everdeen, after breaking the force field surrounding her second Hunger Games, has been rescued by District 13. While Peeta Mellark is captured by the Capitol, the rebels are asking Katniss to become the Mockingjay -- the symbol, the face, of the revolution. Agreeing to this means working for District 13's president, who isn't exactly the biggest fan of Katniss, but it's also the only way she can save Peeta and the rest of the victors. And the only way she can kill President Snow. This book puts us in an entirely new setting -- not District 12, not the arena or the Capitol, but instead District 13, underground, and the various poor districts where the revolution is being fought. The atmosphere, mood, and setting is clearer than ever in this book. Between the ruins of Katniss' and Gale's home, the stark and strict District 13, and the fighting, every place we visit in this book is so incredibly intense. Full of emotion and desperation, I'm not sure I've come across a book that did a better job of showing setting.    In this book, Katniss really grows into herself. Unlike in the previous books, now she has some power (although maybe not so much as she'd like) and is much less unsure and wishy-washy than before. Yes, she still goes back and forth on some issues, but when she does her motivations and confusions are much clearer. There was, surprisingly, only one point during this book that I wanted to throw it across the room. And, in hindsight, I believe there was more at play in this moment than was clear in the scene itself. (Those of you who've read the book may know what I'm talking about.) Since this is the one book that doesn't feature the Hunger Games, we get to see Katniss with the people she grew up with. This means that her and Gale's relationship is pushed to the forefront, the relationships with her mother and Prim are revisted in more detail, and we really get to see the love she has for the place she grew up. Throughout THE HUNGER GAMES and CATCHING FIRE, Katniss was so incredibly independent that it was really hard to see the feelings she had for her family. She was often impatient with her mother and though she took her sister's place in the Games, we really didn't get to see much of this relationship. In this book, that was remedied. We get to know the sisters' relationship, as well as getting to know Prim as her own character. It was also nice getting to know Gale better. I'm not a Gale fan and always felt that his relationship with Katniss was closer to that of a brother or cousin than boyfriend, but that said, I loved really being able to see the history that the two of them had together before the Games.    As for Peeta and what happens to him in the last installment, there's not much I can say that isn't a spoiler. I will say that there is a new (and very painful) component to the Peeta/Katniss relationship. And yet, as painful and awful as it was, I think it played out perfectly, especially as we got deeper into the story. That said, this book is definitely not about Gale v. Peeta. Yes, that is an element, and one that Katniss struggles with. But it's not at the forefront. It shouldn't be at the forefront. Katniss, Gale, Peeta, and everyone else in this incredible book, are dealing with a war and the consequences of war. There's not a lot of time for teenage love here.    Throughout the entire series, I had some pretty big problems with Katniss. I wasn't sure I ever liked her. As compelling as she was, it wasn't her that made me want to continue the series after THE HUNGER GAMES. It was Peeta, it was the twists that happened along the day, it was her world that sucked me in. And while MOCKINGJAY still didn't make her my favorite character ever, it did an impressively good job of redeeming her in my eyes. In this book, she had emotions. She was conflicted, but it was understandable. On the whole, she wasn't cold, and when she was you could see why. With the exception of one scene, one heart-wrenching, what-the-hell-are-you-doing-Katniss!!!?? scene that boggled my mind, I liked Katniss. For the first time I felt like I understood her. (And that one scene? I think Collins leaves it up to us to figure out what we think was going through Katniss' mind at that point, and what I think was happening behind the scenes redeems her, if that makes any sense to you.)    This series ended perfectly. This book ended perfectly. Collins did the seemingly-impossible in that she wrote a real, true-to-the-story ending that only made me love the series more. She stayed true to what she'd set up previously and somehow made it work unbelievably well. Honestly, the ending might just be my favorite part of the entire series.

B003PIUBZS|3.0|The fighting scenes are too slow and drawn out. It seemed like a very low budget adaptation of the movie \\"300\\".  I loved the gratuitous nudity; I'm definitely a breast man.

B003XX2PPO|5.0|I must admit I prefer slow boleros but I try to judge the album not based on my personal taste.  The uptempo songs are not similar to the uptempo songs in past years, they definitely sound mature and made especially for Luis Miguel and his band.  The horn section in \\"Mujer de Fuego\\" sounds fantastic.  The most beautiful song for me is \\"Tres Palabras\\". I love this old fashion sound with a trumpet solo.   Luis Miguel's interpretation of Manzanero's songs earns my applause. \\"No Existen Limites\\", \\"De Quien Es Usted\\", \\"Lo Que Queda De Mi\\" show amazing vocals and wonderful symphony sound.  I think that the song \\"Siento\\" could have success in the english market. Background vocals of the well known gospel group Take Six highlight the production.  \\"Tal Vez Me Mientes\\" is different from all, it has disco influences, reminds me Earth Wind and Fire sound of the late 1970s.   So my final conclusion regarding this cd is: it's a fantastic cd. I gave it 5 stars for the quality: from the music all the way to the musicians and audio production. Everything is first class.

Although we all enjoyed the premise and story line, we all cringed at the amount of bad language throughout the movie.  There is quite a bit of swearing throughout the movie and the playboy magazine was a little uncomfortable but overall it's a fun, silly movie and fun to see an 80's movie still survive.

0439023513|5.0|My son couldn't wait for this book to come since he enjoyed the other 2 so much.  We pre-ordered the book and he had it finished before we even saw it for sale in any of the book stores.  As a third in a series...this book does not disappoint.  Suzanne Collins is a master with words and storylines and you'll enjoy each of the books in this series but be eager to get through them since the suspense is so great.
1416589473|5.0|Its a good book, but unless you played through the first guild wars you prolly wont understand the book. Idk why you would get this if u didn't play at least one of the guild wars series. Good games btw.   If you are getting ready for Guild Wars 2 and you would like not only a good read, but background and something to add to the upcoming game, you should buy this book.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|The world maps are unreadable on a Kindle. Sure, you can find these maps online, but why should we ignore the fact that publishers (and so many at that) continue to put out eBooks with spelling errors, formatting errors, low-resolution images, and missing images? Be aware that if you get the Kindle version that you will not be able to make sense of the world map (which is integral to your reading experience).     Problems with the Kindle version aside, the books is fantastic.

B000FC13Y0|4.0|The book is a lot of fun and worth reading.<br /><br />With that out of the way, the Kindle version is rushed. With typos, formatting errors, and extremely low-resolution images.

Complain with your reviews and make these problems known so we can stop this problem as soon as possible.
0312588887|5.0|This is at least the 3rd time I have read this story. I just love the way it was written What a great story of generations and how a young girls builds up her own dynasty and is rich beyond belief. Emma Harte is such a strong woman and has such a head for business and for revenge. When emma is 16 she is scorned by the Fairleys and leave her home. she is determined to get rich by her own dueings and to provide for her family. Emma marries many time unitl she find the love of her life. She also encounters a lot of hardship and death in her lifetime, but much happiness. This is a must read and the best novel she has written. there are sequels to this story line to so if you enjoy this one read the sequel voice of the heart.

B002EWD0I6|5.0|So far I have watched only season 1 of Lark Rise to Candleford.  At first I was somewhat hesitant, because my first impression was that this was going to be just a British \\"Ann of Green Gables.\\"  Once I watched the first few episodes though, I found myself truly enjoying this show.<br /><br />This is a BBC production, and is a period piece set in an out of the way corner of England someplace.  Lark Rise is a small hamlet where tenant farmers and workers live their poor, day-to-day lives doing day labor or whatever they can to get by.  The land is owned by the local squire, and he sees it as his duty to watch over and protect his people.  Candleford is the local market town.  People in Candleford consider themselves to be socially higher than those of Lark Rise, though their paths pass on a regular basis.<br /><br />The main story involves a young girl from Lark Rise who goes into a sort of appreticeship with the post mistress in Candleford.  At first life in town is new and hard for her, but in time she finds her place.  The post mistress is a woman who is wise and kind, with a spark of life that is easy to see.  You will meet all the people who work for and with her in the post office, as well as other people in both Candleford and Lark Rise.  I actually found myself liking most of the people in the story, and wondering about what was going to happen next.<br /><br />As one would expect, the BBC has done a fantastic job with casting, costuming, the script, acting, and story development. My family and I look forward to moving on to the other seasons of this fine show.<br /><br />5 solid stars!
B00275EGX8|5.0|Yes, there are things that are very inaccurate with regards to how the Army operates, but if it were 100% accurate, the movie would be boring.  People look way too far into the film and judge every little aspect and do not enjoy the film for what it is, a character study of a disturbed soldier and the implications of his actions and of those around him.  It's a great film on many levels, and while the film is realistic in comparison to most other films, it's not supposed to be entirely accurate for the sake of the story.  Almost any movie that is based on something historical or cultural is not going to be exactly accurate.  Even great films like JFK, Braveheart and Gladiator are terribly inaccurate, yet are still amazing films and great STORIES.

B003VQM2LU|5.0|I've been a huge Nick Cave fan for years. The first Grinderman release, in my opinion was slightly above average.  Definitely not as good as anything he's ever done with the Bad Seeds, but I did appreciate it for what it was. Grinderman's second eponymous album is even better than the first. A solid nine songs, I would even go as far as to say that it may be my favorite release of 2010 thus far. It's obvious that this new line-up is beginning to hit their stride and distancing themselves from their parent group.     I don't make it a habit of reviewing anything for Amazon unless I see that the \\"average\\" score is beginning to lean--in my opinion--in an unfavorable direction. I see that this release currently has an average of 3.5 stars, which just isn't right. I do believe that as more reviews weigh in, this average will go up. I hope this review helps the cause.

B00371QQ0M|2.0|I'll make it short.    +'s - The movie is superb!  The movie itself - especially if you are a Dune sci fi fan - is excellent, a very good rendition of the book.  And the BluRay quality is up to snuff for a movie of this age.    -'s - The BluRay functionality is clunky.  The change from entry to menu to play to actually seeing the movie is incredibly slow.  Don't lose your patience because it will eventually come onto your screen.  The other mind bloggling goof is if you pause the movie, it goes into some kind of stasis and reverts to start.  DO NOT DO ANYTHING TO CHANGE YOUR CONTROLS ONCE YOU HAVE BEGUN.    In short, for Dune lovers it's a great movie as long as you can bear with the poor functionality around the presentation.  Hang in there!
0316098337|5.0|\\"Room\\" is narrated by 5 year-old Jack.  How can a 5 year-old entertain us in language beyond \\"See Spot run\\"?  That is the magic of Emma Donoghue's literary genius, giving Jack a voice that is endearing and true.<br /><br />Jack has been raised in isolation, accompanied only by his mother (\\"Ma\\") in an 11 x 11 foot room.  Together, they have a routine for their days.  They are not allowed outside although television is available.  Ma has taught Jack stories, songs, fables, to read and to write.  They make word sandwiches (scare + brave= scave). They do PE times of track and gymnastics.<br /><br />Jack is mostly happy.  He has what he needs, his mother, and usually enough food, and an imagination to create the egg snake and paper ball.  His mother is not doing as well as Jack.  She used to know the outside world.  She knows what it means to have time to oneself.  She and Jack live in terror of Old Nick, who holds the keys to their ROOM, their haven and their prison. He does provide food and brings in Sundaytreat, a study in what one needs versus what one wants. He is the worst of the monsters in the closet come to life.<br /><br />While this may sound like a terrifying story, it is beautifully told, full of poignant moments and reflections, and gives us a chance to look at how mothering a child creates his view of the world.  Jack is an endearing boy.<br /><br />This book is truly unique and wonderful.  Thank you, thank you, Emma Donoghue, for letting me spend some time with Jack and Ma and ROOM.
B003V4AK8E|4.0|I bought my PS3 a few years ago and I have hated the controller as it is too light and hurts my left thumb because of the position of the left stick. I love the Xbox 360 controller and been trying to find something similar that will work on the PS3. I noticed the Pro Elite Wireless Controller in an article and it caught my eye.    What I liked about this controller was the L/R 2 buttons feel a lot better and have some grip. The left stick is positioned at a good spot on the controller. The buttons feel good and not to cheap. It has all the key features of the Dualshock 3 such as motion control, rumble, and wireless but not Bluetooth wireless. The D-Pad feels good.    What I do not like about it is it does look kind of cheap but it doesn't feel cheap. The right stick seems to be too far away from the main button pads, noticeably farther away than the Dualshock 3. It is a little light for my liking, I like heavier controllers. The rubber grip does feel a little weird, it could have done without.    Overall, if you are looking for a good Xbox 360 like controller on the PS3. This would be your best bet.
B003UYUR10|3.0|Well, this movie is pretty good not great. It could've been a lot better. It would be one to own if the price was fair.I will buy it when the price drops,,,drops way down. I'm sick and tired of big companies charging crazy prices they keep going up. Even in a good econemy these prices are wrong. It seems the worse the econemy gets the more they raise the prices. Well that won't work on everyone. If and when this movie is sold at a fair and reasonable price I'll buy it.That's how I feel about all DVD prices. Very few movies nowdays are worth 27.00 to 30.00 and then that's still pretty steep prices.
0765326353|5.0|The entire time, while reading this book, I would on occasion shout out \\"WHY IS THIS BOOK SO GOOD!?\\" The pacing in the story is terrific, and the characters are amazing. Sanderson's characters are all introduced in the middle of something, which I find great. A lot of books in this genre start you out with a bumbling character who's barely competent who grows into something, which is nice in it's own little way, but being given a character who's already grown, seeing how they got to that point, and then watching them grow even further is refreshing. Overall, he manages to create a thousand page book that doesn't feel like a thousand page book. You just keep reading and reading until suddenly, you find yourself at the end, and extremely sad that there isn't more. The fact that the book is so good just makes things harder since you really want to read the next book but there isn't one as of yet.    The only thing that really gets me though, is the fact that on the kindle version (I have the kindle 2) is that the images aren't as clear and easy to read as they could be. I don't know how it is on the kindle DX, or if the newer kindles have a higher resolution so some of the nuances of Shallan's sketchbook can be read, but if you plan to buy this book and want to enjoy the amazing artwork that it has, getting the hardcover is definitely recommended (I've bought the book twice now -_-, at least I can loan one out).    A nice thing about having it on the kindle though is that you can create bookmarks for certain parts of the story so you can hop back if you want to reference it later, and being able to search through the text is a godsend halfway through when a character is introduced and you aren't sure if you met them earlier or not.    Something that is related to both kindle and normal versions is the fact that the appendix is sorely lacking. While it explains some things, about other things it gives you nothing. Since Sanderson built the world from scratch, having a glossary of terms would have been nice, although you can infer what a lot of things are from context clues, having something that you can thumb too quickly to reference if you still haven't figured it out would be nice. Heres to hoping that future books have an expanded appendix, complete with small bits of info about the various characters.

B000063DFN|5.0|Iron Maiden seemingly could do no wrong in the `80s and their 1984 album, Powerslave, is no exception. Arguably their best album next to Number of the Beast, Powerslave contains three of the band's most beloved tracks including an epic that is par excellence for the genre. There is no bad moment here and even the lesser known songs are pretty good. Those tracks include \\"Flash of the Blade\\" and the \\"The Duellists\\" which feature great choruses and excellent guitar work from Dave Murray and Adrian Smith. \\"Loster Words (Big `Orra)\\" is a decent instrumental that is brought up a notch by the band's stellar chops. \\"Back in the Village\\" is a melodic rocker that works very well. And then comes the greatness as the rampaging \\"Aces High\\" and the mid-tempo \\"2 Minutes to Midnight\\" are two of Maiden's best 10 or 15 songs and their videos would get generous airplay on MTV. The title track is also outstanding with a great galloping bass line from Steve Harris and enough sudden changes in momentum to keep you interested. Then there's \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\". Up until this point, a long epic like this was Rush's calling card and even that was years earlier. However, \\"Rime....\\" would take Maiden to another level as this 13:39 tour de force had everything; an awesome and dramatic lead vocal from Bruce Dickinson, changes in tempo and mood throughout, electrifying performances from the band, and, most importantly, it was memorable!  All told, Powerslave is one of Iron Maiden's best and if you love metal, it's worth owning.
B003EV6DBM|1.0|As a lifelong Dr. Who fan who is 52 years old, I have to say, this is just not my Dr. Who. First off, he's just too young. But, more so, he's just not The Doctor. He is a kid who is full of himself and clearly out of his league. I have watched every episode of this new season with Matt Smith desperately looking for something to like. I cannot, and have not found it. I believe that the writers are going back to the original plan in writing the story for children this time around. It's sad, because David Tennant was an excellent doctor. As was Christopher Eccelston, and all who came before him. I even liked the Peter Cushing doctor, and the Paul McGann Dr. as well. I know many fans liked neither. I feel I am a true fan. I loved William Hartnell and the so called clown Patrick Troughton. Though, to this day, Jon Pertwee is my favorite, Tom Baker second, and Chris E. third, then David Tennant. There has not been one story with Matt Smith that I have felt worthy of wanting to own.{****Spoiler Alert**** Read on at your own risk} The final episode as pointed out by another reviewer just wipes out the whole story of the Matt Smith's first season, what a cop-out. That in itself is the kookiest (for lack of a better term) choice the writers ever could have made. The whole was that Amy brings him back by remembering him makes no sense at all. I guess the main thing about science fiction that makes me love it, and always has, is the science part of it. They seem to have taken the science out of this season of Dr. Who with this particular Dr. I won't buy it, I have purchased most of every other dvd out there containing Dr. Who. I have all 4 of the prior seasons, and most of the specials, most of the dvd's of the earlier doctors as well. When the prices come down on the newer releases I will own them also. But, I doubt I would want this in my collection. Sorry, Matt. You are just not my doctor.<br /><br />Ralph J. Fitcher<br /><br />Update 5/28/13: I have long since purchased series 5 and series six of Matt Smith's Doctor Who. I am however afraid I have not had time to watch either. I will update further when I do, here's hoping having them on DVD will make this new Doctors' experience better for me.<br /><br />Ralph J. Fitcher
B0000071GA|4.0|I purchased Headhunter not long after it came out in '83. Dug up the cassette the other day and put it in. It's just as I remembered. First half of the album is great, second half is pretty decent. I also have or have heard most of their `80s albums and this was definitely the best one. \\"Screaming in the Night\\" is an awesome power ballad and is certainly the band's best moment. \\"Eat The Rich\\", \\"Ready to Burn\\", and the title track are all great hard rock tunes if you can get past Marc Storace's occasional screaming. The second half's highlight is the cover of BTO's \\"Stayed Awake All Night\\", which they stretch out with some good guitar solos. The remaining songs are all good, particularly the rampaging \\"Russian Winter\\". This would be Krokus' biggest selling album too and it's a shame they got trendy and went all pop/rock on The Blitz and Change of Address. This is the sound that best suited them. Interestingly, the original lineup is back and their latest album called Hoodoo is pretty decent. For the uninitiated, I'd recommend this over one of their greatest hits albums, which are all heavy on the cover tunes.
B001A5HBJC|5.0|Writing, Cast and production tops for me.<br /><br />Weiner is a genius.  I am now at Season 4 and the writing continues to be fresh and the character development is fruitful.  Recommend it highly.  I watch very little network telivison now and I made a point to watch Mad Men.
B00376ZG0I|2.0|I spent my weekend trying to successfully convert LPs to CDs. The turntable is okay, but the Mac software is inadequate. The turntable comes with two programs. The simpler one doesn't automatically create tracks or let  you set the recording level, which caused big problems. The more complex software, Audacity, crashed. I downloaded GoldenRecords, which also had problems with recording levels. Unless you really enjoy messing with software and hardware settings, you might want to consider another product, or at least find software that works well and easily
B003JLA4KS|4.0|Overall the documentary was definitly worth watching and absorbing.  I have been a devoted Rush fan close to 30 years now.  At the time of writing this I must set a few things straight to the reading public.<br /><br />First, I think the most fruitful periods of Rush were the Terry Brown period -  2112 - Through Signals. Terry did work on a few albums prior but I felt those particular albums were the best in terms of writing and arranging.  I think Terry was integral in their sound.  I think he latched on to the strong points of Rush and exploited it to their advantage.<br /><br />Ok, with that being said Strong points of the film for me:<br />First, we see for the first time the early period that included John Rutsey.  I didn't realize he was the spokesperson of the band at this time.  We see some historic video of him introducing the members of the band etc.<br /><br />Secondly, There is this early video of Alex Lifeson addressing his parents in a room of other people discusing his future as a musician rather than following the norm.  I am wondering where this video came from.  I think it was astounding that the producers got hold of this.  It almost had a feel it was an early documentary in which Lifeson was a part of.  Would like to know more about it, but it is a gem here to see Alex in such raw and rebelious form as a young man.<br /><br />Thirdly, they touched base on the period of Rush in which keyboards took over, namely in the later 80's.  I left Rush for a period after this and it also was the same period in which Terry Brown Left  (After Signals). It just reinforced my own belief here that something changed.  I never thought that it was a positive change, because I don't think Rush has ever been as productive as they were in the Brown period.  In saying that however, they are monumental live and always have been.<br /><br />I am glad they also shot some video of Neil on the road with his motorcycle.  I have read all his books.  I feel he is unbelievable as an author.  For those who think he is un-reachable to the fans, he is a completely different person in his books and very very genuine.<br /><br />Now for the weak parts and for which I took off a star:<br />This documentary did not Need the likes of Jack Black or Gene Simmons to give any interviews here.  I thought it cheapened the production and made it more theatrical.  I didn't care about those parts.  The documentary could have stood on it's own without stars lending words to Rush.  Rush was never mainstream and hard to classify except for people like me and the devoted.  You either like Rush or not.  There is no in-between here.<br /><br />Overall a great documentary.  Well Done.n-reachable to the fans, he is a completely different person in his books and very very genuine.
