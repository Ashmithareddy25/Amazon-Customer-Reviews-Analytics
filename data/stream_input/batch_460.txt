B0002VHBTK|5.0|This was a very interesting movie. Filmed in three parts, each section is divided by a bedroom conversation between the two main characters. Each conversation brings forth a different perspective and outcome to the current situation they are dealing with. What this movie was telling me, that if you listen with deeper understanding, you will get it right the first time..only this was portrayed in reverse. Very enjoyable.
B00005JLT5|5.0|Awesome. This one word sums it up. Unlike most of the war movies which ends on a melancholy note. This gives hope. Its exceptional. The background music is sublime. If this has won so many Oscars its because it deserves all those Oscars. <br />
0609610570|1.0|This book is absolutely painful to read.  Execution is an elementary managerial guidebook  - basically Management 101.   <br /> <br />The book is light on real, substantive content.  Experienced managers (like those so often used as examples in the book) will fall asleep reading this book.  The crux of the book is that good leaders should know their people, insist on realism, set clear goals, follow through, reward the doers, expand people's capabilities, know yourself, and be personally involved in hiring your managers.  Duh!   <br /> <br />There are several letters used as examples of in-depth analysis, careful evaluation, meticulous due diligence, and deep personal involvement in the operating plan development.  I personally felt that the letters (like the letter used on pages 255 to 257) demonstrated that only a superficial and cursory analysis of the operating plan had been performed. <br /> <br />The only possible addition to the world of leadership science is the repeated recommendation (throughout the entire 265 pages) for implementing Six Sigma and digitization into organizations.  Six Sigma is an excellent quality management program.  I highly recommend using Six Sigma, but this is not necessarily new to the world of management. <br /> <br />I personally felt that the authors wrote this book not so much for the purposes of adding something truly relevant to the business world, but for self gratification and personal agrandizement.  They share personal example after personal example of wins and successes leaving one to wonder, \\"why have I never heard about these guys?  They must walk on water!\\"  I have heard about Jack Welch, their mentor, - perhaps because he also suffers from a healthy self-promoting ego structure. <br /> <br />I believe success also usually masks the personal failures - something almost completely absent from the book except in the examples of others.  I think sharing a few of their personal failures would have given the book a level ofauthenticity.  Moreover, the personal trials and failures would be meaningful for learning purposes. <br /> <br />The writing style used in Execution alternates between third person, first person (Larry), first person (Ram), and even an interviewing style.  I went crazy with the style issues.  Most of the time I was just trying to remember or figure out who was writing/talking/speaking.  I am surprised that this book made it through editing.   <br /> <br />Execution is filled with redundancy and repetitive comments driving the reader crazy.  I read the entire 265 pages thinking maybe the gem or nugget of information is saved for later in the book.  Unfortunately, all that is contained in the latter pages is repetitive content and more personal agrandizement. <br /> <br />I would never compare this book to Good to Great - as many reviewers have done.  Good to Great is quite honestly good - it relies on data, facts, and research.  In fact, General Electric (their oft cited example of a role model company) missed being included in the Good to Great companies list.  GE stock outperformed the market by about 2.8 times during the period between 1985 and 2000 while the average Good to Great company outperformed the market by 6.9 times (more than double the performance of GE).  General Electric was good, but not great. <br /> <br />This book is half baked, poorly written, and content light.  There are a number of half finished stories and examples to demonstrate various points throughout the book.  For example, Larry Bossidy shares an example of advice given to his son in preparation for his first planning session as a Vice President at GE Capital on page 208 (making me wonder about nepotism policies at GE).  The story shares the fatherly advice, but never conveys the resolution of the story or how things turned out.  This happens repeatedly throughout the book.  It leaves the reader wondering \\"what happened?\\" <br /> <br />I can only give this book 1 star.  I sincerely hopesomeone else will write on this subject.  Execution is invaluable in today's business climate.
B00008H2LB|5.0|People who listen to this and think that this album is not as good as Hybrid Theory is clearly mistaken. Meteora is, in my opinion, more structured than Hybrid Theory. Hybrid Theory's weakness was that some songs just doesn't seem to fit in. Three obvious ones are the tracks With You, By Myself and Cure for the Itch. Each of Meteora's songs are strong, as seems to fit in well with each other.  <br /> <br />Almost each song in the album has a new feature of rock that has never been experience, which is probably why many don't like it. Songs like Faint and Breaking the Habit took the sampling to a whole new level, and we can't ignore that. Linkin Park has worked hard out on this album and has produced another album better than the first. <br /> <br />I would also strongly recommend listeners to have a better understanding of the lyrics. Each lyrics fits the mood that the song meant to have. Linkin Park has really outdone themselves. I can't wait for their next major installment.
B00000G3PA|4.0|Armageddon, to me, lacks the serious note that it is meant to have. The world is about to be destroyed, and all the astronauts (or 'supposed' astronauts) can to is bicker, squabble, and add uselessly witty comments here and there. Don't get me wrong, i liked the film, and thought it was quite riveting, it just had a few holes in the script. The acting was highly varied, Bruce Willis was, as usual, kick ass - but in some scenes, his acting seemed unnecessary. For example, when the nuclear weapon is about to detonate, he calmly tells the pilot that he has never failed.. e.t.c. and that he won't accept failure.. e.t.c. - he doesn't once look at the timer, and draws out his sentiments as though he has all the time in the world. Wouldn't you be panicking? i know i would. Other performances were better, i am pleased to say - i especially liked the performances from 'bear' who bought a touch of realism to the whole thing, and 'col. willie Sharp' as the focussed, cold pilot of the mission. So its not all bad ;-)

Not one guy that *I* pursued ever worked out.  EVER. I was trained to go after things in work situations.  I could never figure it out.  I hate to accept the fact that men don't like to be called, asked out, etc.  But it just doesn't work.  If it works for you, then you have something I don't have! <br /> <br />Sadly enough even though I'm married I have had to apply this to several girlfriends.

1572814349|5.0|Oh, how you will love this deck!!!  It is amazing how taken I am with it!  At first, I thought the deck a little too serious - <br />people from this time period don't smile as often as we do now, but I have gotten very used to that and it is absolutely my favorite deck.  For some reason, I find this deck works especially well with males I am reading for - I can feel the masculine energy go through my body as I lay out the cards.  The cards are beautiful - you can get so lost in them.  The symbolism works perfectly with the Rider-Waite decks, but with just a twist that makes you think above and beyond.  At first, I used the meanings for the cards from another book, but now am more and more taken by the meanings in the little book that comes with this deck - somehow, they are really in tune and I have had some amazing predicitons!  Beautifully done and presented in such an artistic and creative way.  This deck has no limits, you will continue to see more and more each time you use it.
B00005JN4O|5.0|My husband as well as myself enjoyed watching this movie. It is a very touching and well written movie that the whole family can see. My husband was reluctant to see it at first, but after viewing the movie, he had nothing but positive remarks and praises for the movie. We recommend this movie for anyone to see. It will be worth your time and money.
B0000AQVCL|1.0|These guys are such poseurs.  Saying that they wear their influences on their sleeves is a massive understatement.  Jet are essentially a cover band, and a crappy cover band at that.<br /><br />If you own this album, you really, really deserve to get punched in the face.
B000002JSP|5.0|A lot of people seem to dislike this album , but I really think if you sit down and listen to it, it's a great album.  Just because its different from their other albums doesn't make it bad.  They make any type of song sound magnificent, so if u really just listen to it i think you'll realize how good it is and how little credit it gets.  Zeppelin is Zeppelin bottom line, Even if you feel it isnt as good as some of their others it doesnt mean its still not a high quality album.
0060920432|4.0|The author's basic argument is that humans who experience Flow more often report better levels of existence.  They are happier.    This book is an excellent read because of its examples; it also has cool pieces to help anyone put together their own puzzle.      Did you know that the leading theory of how cultures switch their general behavior acknowledges an altruistic side and a materialistic side - and only those sides?      BACK TO THE CONCEPT    Let's say you just stop doing something, and you realize that you were COMPLETELY engrossed in whatever you were doing.  You stop for a minute, and think, woah, what the hell just happened?    It happens to everyone, but at Dr. C points out, to some more than other.    The task...    Must have your complete and undivided attention:       1.  By having your skills adequate to presented challenges       2.  By having clear goals (expectations) of achievement       3.  By having immediate feedback of action to task      PEOPLE IN FLOW    People who are often in Flow activities describe the experience as being \\"one\\" with the stated activity.    Dr. C named this experience with any activity as Flow; based off of the most commonly used word interviewees gave when immersed in any type of activity.      Believe in Flow.  Go play a game like Tetris and find where it is, and where it is not.  Generally Dr. C would say, if I could speak for him, that the Flow in a game like Tetris would come at that point where you really need to find a place for a piece and are focusing completely and utterly on doing just that.    The book has its nice strands and its drab strands, I'd say become at least familiar with the concept.      (...)
B000025AJM|5.0|This debut here, released in 1969, influenced quite a few musicians in the rock world, especially those found under the \\"progressive\\" rock label. After more than 30 years since it's release, it still sounds as fresh, explosive and provocative. This is without a doubt my favorite King Crimson album (with their 1973's release _Larks' Tongues In Aspic_ in a close second.)<br /><br />It starts off with the fiery \\"21st Century Schizoid Man,\\" which is a mix of scathing proto-metal and fiery jazz: listen to how Greg Lake's processed vocals sound akin to something of an apocalypse, which are backed by some harsh, distorted, convulsive blasts, and how during the verses, we are treated to the scorching guitar and saxophone lines playing the same melody in unison. It's intense stuff, and this song -- for better or worse -- is the benchmark to which nearly everything Crimson released afterward would be compared. Indeed, this song embodies a *huge* part of what Crimson is, and what they would be for their entire career. \\"I Talk To The Wind\\" is an interesting and mellow mix of R&B and light orchestral: the kind of tune you would hear if The Everly Brothers got together with The Moody Blues, and sang lyrics to a Black Sabbath tune. It's very ethereal, melodic and soothing. Love the flute playing on here.<br /><br />\\"Epitath\\" is a very absorbing extended tune with great vocals and lush, dramatic mellotron. The lyrics and singing here are quite disturbing. Once again, this track has an interesting crazed mix of psychedelia/R&B/classical rock. \\"Moonchild\\" starts off like an almost bedtime lullaby, which I find beautiful and imaginative, then it segues into the most challenging part of the disc. The last nine minutes of this song is nothing but instrumental experimentation. I don't personally find it as awful as many others seem to, in fact I find it enriching and mind-expanding, but still challenging. It especialy works best at nighttime. \\"The Court Of The Crimson King\\" is probably my favorite, though it's hard to choose. This is the most symphonic on here. The ahhh-ahh-ahh-ahh melody backed by the D-C-B progression is just phenomenal and too good for words. Listen to Greg Lake's dramatic, regal and enchanting vocals here.<br /><br />This album is considered a classic for a reason. Highly recommended for fans of prog-rock, or music that is imaginative and challenging.ugh it's hard to choose. This is the most symphonic on here.

B000001EAQ|5.0|I really wansn't even a U2 fan until some friends dragged me to see them during their POPMART tour.  I heard Gone, MOFO, Discoteche, and Staring at the Sun for the first time...  I was blown away and instantly hooked.  Surely these can't be the same guys that wrote \\"New Years Day,\\" or, \\"One.\\"  While I liked some of U2's older stuff, this album caught me hook, line and sinker and I've been a fan ever since.  \\"Gone\\" is like a sonic overture for the right side of your brain, and \\"MOFO\\" just reaks of sex appeal and suave.  I know some U2 fans that would consider themselves \\"U2 purists\\" and rejected this album when it came out, and perhaps that is exactly what I love about it.  U2 was able to turn their nose up at the critics and expand their musical abilites and horizons, and they did so with wreckless abandon on this album.  It was easily one of the best written, performed and conceived albums of the 90's and is a tribute to every musical artist that has ever challenged themselves and their abilities by bucking the trend and trying something new and fresh.
B00005MFVQ|5.0|King Crimson's second album, 1970's _In The Wake of Poseidon_, has often been accused of being a weak, carbon-copy of King Crimson's monumental 1969 debut _In The Court Of The Crimson King_. To be honest, one can hear many similarities between these two albums: the blending of fiery, jazz-rock numbers counterbalanced by smooth, lush orchestral numbers, as well as the first half of the album exhibiting parallels to many tracks from the debut. However, on the whole, this album seems to carry a bit more diversity than the debut does.<br /><br />It starts with the trippy, vocal experimentation of \\"Peace (A Beginning),\\" which is followed by the manic, fiery jazz-rock of \\"Pictures Of A City.\\" This has been compared to \\"21st Century Schizoid Man.\\" It features the processed vocals found on that infamous track, as well as the scorching proto-metal blasts, not to mention those screaming guitar and saxophone lines playing the melodic lines in unison. \\"Cadence And Cascade\\" is an ethereal r&b/rock tune that's been compared to \\"I Talk To The Wind.\\" This features some of Robert Fripp's most melodic and tasteful guitar playing. The vocals done by Gordon Haskell are very beautiful as well.<br /><br />The title track (often compared to \\"Epitath\\") is probably my personal favorite on here. An ingratiating mix of r&b, psychedelia and lush symphonic rock, combined with impassioned vocals makes this arguably the standout amongst many greats. \\"Peace (A Theme)\\" is a melodic guitar instrumental that prepares you for the manic, jazz-rock musings of \\"Cat Food.\\" It is in this track, in which you will find foreshadowings of what would largely comprise their next album, 1970's _Lizard_. \\"The Devil's Triangle\\" is a darkly symphonic piece based on (if not entirely derivative of) the 'Mars: Bringer of War' movement from Holst's epic, The Planets. Listen for a section from \\"The Court Of The Crimson King\\" (title track from debut) at the very end of this song. The album closes with \\"Peace (An End),\\" which features sad vocal delivery from Greg Lake. Sad, as in this was Greg's very last vocal performance with Crimson, as he would join the mighty ELP.<br /><br />This is a worthy addition to your King Crimson collection, even though the many parallelisms between this and their debut may be a bit disappointing to many.),\\" which features sad vocal delivery from Greg Lake.

B000063COX|5.0|This album realy is worthy of 5 stars. So many classic Maiden songs here and no fillers unlike \\"killers\\". The lyrics may be dated and a bit corny in a few songs,but once you get past that you have a classic metal album. The songs here are rather simple pretty catchy and have some what of a punk feal to them and still have great solos and unforgettable riffs that every metal head should recognize. It also contains 2 awsome ballads and the epic \\"phantom of the opera\\". The rest of the songs all shine in there own right with there sing along verses and chorus's and catchy riffs that will make you want to pick up a guitar and start jammin! Paul Dianno has a wonderfull voice that will make you want to STAND UP AND SHOUT! and delivers a vocal performance on this album that bruce can not come to par with when singing these songs live today! New maiden fans not farmiliar with paul should not miss out on this! A classic Maiden album that every metal head should own. The music here shines straigth through(no filler)so there will be no need to skip a track even\\"trannsylvania\\"(great instrummental) .
B0000028RR|5.0|Powerful debut from the Los Angeles quintuplet band. This is the album that had me pick up a guitar and learn to play. Tom Morrelo's guitar at times sound very Pageish and at other times sound unlike anything ever put to wax. Coupled with De La Rocha's politically charged lyrics and blood curdling screams of freedom as well as one of the greatest rhythm sections ever heard and it's no wonder why this record is filled with such intensity. Rage soundbombed every arena they played in becoming one of the greatest live acts of all time. Standouts include Bombtrack, Killing In The Name, Bullet In The Head, and Freedom.
B00005JM1F|2.0|This movie is what happens when the guys from \\"Animal House\\" decide that the real world is too real for them. To sum it up, Vince Vaughn, Will Farrell, and Luke Wilson start a fraternity in the midst of female problems in order to save Wilson's character from losing his house. From there, hilarity is supposed to ensue when they degenerate into a college lifestyle of partying it up and getting crazy.  <br /> <br />I wanted to like this movie because I like the stars of this movie. I wanted to laugh out loud, and I wanted to come away from this movie raving like everyone else did when they saw it, but I couldn't. Other than a great 80s music soundtrack and a cameo from Snoop Doggy Dog, there is nothing original about this movie that sets it apart. If you want classic National Lampoon, get \\"Animal House\\".  <br /> <br />The humor is simply stale. It's all been done before in just about every movie of this general genre since the early 80s.  And while stupid-funny is good, this only manages to be stupid. It isn't even charming in its stupidity. <br /> <br />What saved it from one star is personal bias. I love the three stars of this movie and generally enjoy watching them in action. Were it not for them, I would have turned this turkey off about halfway through.
3931141802|5.0|Robert Frank with this small little book changed the course of photography. He changed the way people take photographs. He changed the way we look at photographs. He changed the definition of what was an acceptable or good photograph. The way Monet and Picasso changed how one could paint, Frank changed the way one could photograph. <br /> <br />How did he do this? He basically introduced the \\"icongraphic photograph\\" to the world. Take for example, his picture in the Americans of a political rally for Ike. It is of a man standing against a blank wall, playing the tuba. But the tuba's opening obscures his face, all you see is the big blank dark opening of the the tuba where his eyes and mouth are suppossed to be. And then right behind the tuba, almost coming out of it, a flag, an American flag, though shapeless, and formless and it snakes out of the picture. On the man's lapel is a big \\"For Ike\\" button. At the time, this was a radical photograph and statement about politics and the role of the individual in political life; remember this was 1957. <br /> <br />There are many many many other photographs like this throughout the Americans: St. Peter taking on City Hall. The American flag covering the faces of the people at a parade. The jukebox everywhere. The signs screaming \\"No Negroes Allowed\\" while on the next page is a photograph of an older black women holding in her arms, caring for, a young white baby. Frank clearly asking, screaming, why is it okay for them to care your for babies but not okay for them to use the same toilet as you? <br /> <br />It is a subtle but very powerful book. And once you see it, once you get it, you can never see a photograph the same way again.  <br /> <br />He has influenced every photographer who has come after him. <br />Without Robert Frank there would be no Gary Winograd, Eugene Richards, Gilles Peres, William Klien, Bruce Davidson, Alex Webb, Salgado, Danny Lyon, James Nachtwey, Lauren Greenblatt, Ron Haviv, or Herb Ritts. <br /><br />This book is the starting point for anyone interested in photography, or at least photography after 1958 when this book was first published. <br />
B0000584V3|5.0|\\"Blackwater Park\\" is one of the most inspiring metal albums I've heard in recent years.  Melodic at times, but still brutally heavy.  It's prog metal without the cheesy synthesizers.   <br /> <br />Opeth are often classified as \\"death metal\\" but there are so many different genres of music amalgamated into their songs that it's difficult to label them (I'm guessing they are influenced by King Crimson as much as Cannibal Corpse). What's so impressive about Opeth is how cleverly they blend their influences together and still maintain a heavy sound.  Just listen to the beautiful melodic cadence on \\"The Drapery Falls\\" reminiscent of \\"A Day in the Life.\\"  These guys are well schooled on classic rock as well as metal.   <br /> <br />The riffs aren't choppy and razor sharp on \\"Blackwater Park\\", they're often more melodic and rhythmic sounding. There are tasteful accompaniments of twelve-string and acoustic guitars that sometimes lurk in the background, but they won't distract you from \\"rocking out\\" to the heavier parts -I love how they throw in short acoustic interludes and then blind side you with ferocious death metal! The hauntingly ethereal sounds of the softer interludes give a new dimension to the death metal vocals too.  The death vocals aren't just \\"thrown in\\" on Blackwater Park either...They are evil as hell!!!  They'll creep up on you and send chills down your spine!   <br /> <br />You may not fall in love with this album the first time you hear it, but that's typical of most progressive music.  Give it a few spins.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed.  There are moments of true brilliance on this album that every music lover should experience.      <br /> <br />\\"Blackwater Park\\" is not just a collection of songs, it's a landscape filled with beauty and danger.  Look through the twisted vines at the faceless apparitions displayed on the cover.  Enter a realm beyond this world.
B000003TSP|5.0|I feel quite the gauche and obscure little gothette, but I only just happened upon this group some six months ago. It is a good thing I suppose that I've always been a touch promiscuous in light of music, and mind you I have yet to find anything too clashing or contradistinct so as to elude my interest - I might not have found them beneath all the plastic, cookie-cutter cutouts strangling modern radio.   <br /> <br />I am so deeply impressed with this album. It is dark, melancholy, a shade morose and gloomy, but also poignantly soft, subtle and all around silky-sweet. It is almost, dare I say, delicate. I've heard tell of this album being described as exuding a mellow, yet piquantly moody, sci-fi aura. I couldn't agree more - it bleeds eerie and alien black, a delish compliment to any morbid, macabre mind, but it also endears itself quite seductively to the hopeless romantic with a weeping, prettily polished forties feel ... almost jazzy at times. Or, at least that is the impression I was left with. <br /> <br />Beth is a fabulous compliment juxtaposed with the beautifully heady, brooding backdrop of crisp percussion, retro brass and writhing tempo. It isn't often, sad to say, that we are appreciated so original and unique an eloquence, but when we are, it leaves quite the imprint indeed. It is positively incomprehensible how natural a match she is to this music. Sheer brilliance.  <br /> <br />It is impossible finding words befitting of this album. It is so many things, but the one thing it is not is dull. It is bewitchingly intelligent and a salad bar for the emotions - it is utterly soul-shattering. It is a little more strange then you're used to, but it is a good kind of strange, you know ... the kind of strange that leaves you dazed and breathless, curiously asking yourself a lot of those little nothings you might have been too scared to ask before.  <br />
0790729628|3.0|Never thought I'd say this, but for once the producers/studio actually showed far better aesthetic judgement than the director!<br /><br />This version is much slower and more self-indulgent.  Whereas the first 1/3 of the studio cut was a little slow, in this director's cut it's more like the first 3/4 of the film positively CRAWLS along, loaded with tons of fat that was justifiably trimmed off---it's as if Scott were trying to emulate Stanley Kubrick's \\"2001\\" artistic genius.  And, sorry to say, fails miserably.<br /><br />The only improvement with this version is that the ending is much more open-ended which fits in better with the whole content of the film, as opposed to the studio version's imposed Cliched Happy Ending.<br /><br />I was also disappointed that the DVD contains zero bonus features, other than the choice of Widescreen on one side and Standard Screen on the other.  It would've been nice to have the option of viewing different endings, or having the director's version on one side and the studio version on the other.<br /><br />For those of you who've never seen this film, it's based on Phillip K. Dick's postmodern classic, \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\"  The subtext of the film, which is much more developed in the novel, is the blurring line between humans and machines especially in a dystopian corporatist and hyper-technological future---or rather, an exploration of what we conventionally think of as \\"human nature\\" itself.  Namely, in what ways are humans similar to machines?  Like the androids in the film, we also become aware of our mortality and try, in equally futile and pathetic ways, to resist it.  Like the androids we also base our personal identity on our memories.  And like them, we are also very much programmed and conditioned to be controlled, manipulated and regimented into narrow slots by  our social elites, which like in the film consist mainly of oligarchical corporations.<br /><br />Unfortunately, neither versions of this film really delve into those subversive questions at the expense of sci-fi entertainment.  The original studio cut was however a far lesser evil.ions of this film really delve into those subversive questions at the expense of sci-fi entertainment.

B00009V8Z9|5.0|I bought this cd a long time ago and about 5 cds later it's still my favorite.  He's even coming to my town and I already bought tickets to see him.  There's only a couple of songs I don't like but the ones I do like make me overlook the \\"bad\\" ones.  It is definitely money well spent.  And I usually always regret buying a cd.  He wrote all the songs and music too!  Here's my ratings- <br /> <br />1. Follow Through (10/10)- Not only are the lyrics good but the music is wonderful as well. My second favorite.  <br /> <br />2. Chariot (10/10)- Beautiful lyrics- it's a great song.  Close third.  <br /> <br />3. Just Friends (9/10)- I like this one.  It's got a good sound to it.  <br /> <br />4. Nice to Meet You Anyway (9/10)- Good song.  Very sweet.  <br /> <br />5. Chemical Party (8/10)- Took some warming up to but I now realize it's a good song.  Don't blow it off immediately.  <br /> <br />6. Belief (5/10)- I don't like this song very much at all. Not that it's bad, just not my taste. A little to cheesy.  <br /> <br />7. Crush (7/10)- Not one of my favorites but I still like it.  <br /> <br />8. I Don't Wanna Be (9/10)- Great lyrics.  It's a good rock song.  Love it.  <br /> <br />9. Meaning (8/10)- Cheesy lyrics are rampant but the actual music makes me forgive it.  <br /> <br />10. More Than Anyone (7/10)- Good song just not my my favorite lyrics. <br /> <br />11. Overrated (11/10)- My favorite song on the album by far.  It's so beautiful (lyrics and music).  His voice is great in this song.  The perfect love song.

B000005YZM|5.0|Many bands (the Beatles, the Beach Boys) at least dabbled in psychedelica, but the Zombies are often overlooked. For the 30th anniversary of \\"Odessey and Oracles,\\" the Zombies' best album was rereleased in a new form, proving that their enchanting psychedelic pop has aged exceeedingly well.<br /><br />The Zombies were unusually good at taking perky, sweet, lush music and wrapping it around a more serious song, such as the upbeat \\"Care of Cell 44\\" (guy writing to his jailed girlfriend), or the lovely \\"A Rose For Emily,\\" a poignant little song that tells of a lonely woman doomed to stay lonely. \\"And as the years go by/she will grow old and die/The roses in her garden fade away/Not one left for her grave...\\"<br /><br />But the Zombies aren't all sadness wrapped in happy music. There are perky songs about being happy in love, losing a love and hoping she'll return, and reminiscing about \\"golden days and golden summer nights.\\" The album ends on a reassuring note with the laid-back \\"Time of the Season,\\" which sounds like the ultimate hippie anthem.<br /><br />The extended anniversary edition has quite a few perks -- the liner notes have a detailed look at the band during the making of \\"Odessey and Oracle\\" and afterwards. There is also each song in both mono and stereo, although on computer I can't tell the difference.<br /><br />Additionally, there are some previously unreleased tracks: an alternate version of \\"A Rose For Emily,\\" which isn't too different from the original. Also a slightly different mix of \\"Time of the Season,\\" which is a bit more uptempo, and an instrumental version of \\"Prison Song aka Care of Cell 44.\\"<br /><br />I have no memories of the 60s, since I was only born in the eighties. But \\"Odessey and Oracle\\" gives a rosy glow to that era,. Psychedelic flair minus the hazy, and every song is a gem. Though \\"Time of the Season\\" was the sleeper hit from the album, it's not the best or catchiest song on here -- it's just one of many excellent ones.<br /><br />Rod Argent was definitely an outstanding songwriter. He was able to create atmospheric and beautiful songs  with very simple writing (\\"Brief candles in her mind/bright and tiny gems of memory\\"). Perhaps his finest moment here is \\"I knew he when summer was her crown/and autumn sad/how brown her eyes,\\" as a kick-off to a colorful look at a woman compared to all the seasons.<br /><br />Colin Blunstone's vocals were well-suited to the music: a bit husky, quite pleasant and mellow. The music itself was generally based on guitar, gentle drums, pretty piano, and wavering Mellotron, with a bit of accordian coming in in one song. There's a rich interweaving of many instruments, in all sorts of pop music. Some is almost classical in tone, some is uptempo stuff that is perfect for the radio.<br /><br />The Zombies were in peak form in \\"Odessey and Oracle,\\" churning out some of the purest pop music ever. As sweet and exquisite as it was in the 1960s.. <br /> <br />Rod Argent was definitely an outstanding songwriter.

B0002F6BRE|3.0|I almost turned it off after the first 10 minutes, groan...<br /><br />It got better, and, yes there are a few funny scenes and one liners, a few.  The female costar was pretty and talented, I can't recall her name, but I suppose we'll be seeing some more of her.<br /><br />Basically this kind of movie is worth seeing once, if you can stomach the cheesy stupid humor and predictability.  I've heard a lot of people say they liked it, so what's to account for taste?  I can't imagine getting excited to see this again, unless you're ten or eleven, so, maybe it's a good gift, but I wouldn't want it in my libarary.<br /><br />Mild recommendation.
B00005JMYI|4.0|Those people that have not liked previous Will Ferrell movies don't need to read on because this movie will not change their minds. For those of us that do like him the Anchorman is a movie that works tirelessly to make you laugh and like most comedies that are this far out on the fringe of slapstick humor some jokes work and some jokes don't. The jokes that do work are very funny. The supporting cast in this movie gets the bulk of the best jokes, in particular Steve Carrell as the weatherman. He is awesome in this movie and in time will be a star himself. He was also very good two summers ago in Bruce Almighty and has made me laugh a lot on the Comedy Network. <br /> <br />I think this film will hold more laughs for the people old enough to remember living in the 1970's. Some of the jokes poking fun at that era will go over the heads of younger viewers. That's not to say they won't laugh, just maybe not as many times. If you like Will Ferrell you will enjoy this movie.  <br />
B0002ZDVEU|2.0|Skip this one, unless your attention span is less than 10 seconds, which is about the longest cut in the film.  It really is like watching two hours of the shower scene in the original Psycho movie.  I feel sorry for the cast which do a really good job, but their talents are cut short by the directors' apparent lack of confidence in their abilities as demonstrated by his over dependence on the edior who cut and pastes the film together out of short three to five second long takes.  It took me a long time to get interested in the film after its weak opening scenes only to lose that interest again mid way through because of the relentless kaleidoscopic effect of the editing.
B00005JN2Z|3.0|Tom Cruise was excellent in this film, perhaps the best performance I have ever seen him have. I am usually not a big fan of Tom Cruise movies, although I don't have anything against him as an actor. If there was a weak link to this picture it would be Jamie Foxx's character. His character seems way to calm under such stressful situations. It was definitely the decision of the director to have the character played out in this manner. In some ways I respect the decision to have the character act somewhat level headed but it does remove the tension from some scenes that could have used it.  <br /> <br />The story itself is simple and I don't consider myself great at predicting the endings of movies (the Sixth Sense had me totally fooled) but I could tell what would happen in this film. Never the less it is worth seeing for action suspense fans. Not as fun and a little more gritty than the Bourne Identity series. <br />
B000001DVD|5.0|Quite possibly the best album of all time.  It's flawless.  Great songs.  Big Guitars.  The guitar sound is almost like Thin Lizzy meets \\"Highway to Hell\\" era AC/DC.  If you only know Def Leppard because you hear \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\"* getting played by some lame DJ in his 80's metal mega-mix BS at whatever lame dance-club you go to...you are really missing out.  This is Def Leppard at their absolute finest.  Actually, this might be hard rock at it's absolute finest.      *I really do like \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\"...people are just ruining it, though.
B0006399FS|5.0|I can almost guarantee the bad reviewers out here haven't given this album enough of a chance. This album is so addictive. When I first heard this album I was a little bummed out because I thought it was a little slow and I was expecting something different. But then after a few more listens this album started growing on me like a fungus! It blows ATYCLB away!  <br />I think a lot of people genuinely hate U2 for whatever reason, which is fine, but get over it and stop throwing bad reviews out here when you've obviously never even listened to the CD.  <br /> Buy this album, burn it into your mind and you'll fall in love with it. I freakin love this album and can't wait to hear these songs live!!!
B000002JK2|4.0|This is one of those albums where the songs are solid, mature, thoughtful, and well-crafted, but overall just not ones that critics or fans would point to and hold up as their greatest work or their fave songs.  It's a very good album, but I just don't feel moved to play it very often.  Though it's sad to realise that Ronnie Lane, who was a very good songwriter and musician, had already come down with MS (which he later died of) during the making of this album, and Pete was giving him a hard time because he thought he was coming to the studio drunk, and felt really bad when he found out he'd been sick and not drunk.  One wonders what might have been if Ronnie's solo career hadn't been cut short by his illness.  Overall it's just a sad melancholy album, with songs like \\"Annie\\" and \\"Keep Me Turning.\\"  Another chilling thing about this album is that it contains one of the three known songs Pete wrote during this period with lines about jumping or falling off of a ledge, \\"Street in the City.\\"
0062515675|3.0|This book is for those who dont have time to read real philosophy. Its like those stories that contain a real message to the reader in the end. Told so because the message as such does not make sense, if told directly. <br /> <br />The book superficially takes you through the basics of Buddhist and Hindu philosophies. Read this book together with 'Who will Cry when you die'. <br /> <br />If you have liked Deepak Chopra's \\"Seven Spiritual Laws of Sucess' or 'How to Know God', you would like this one too.  <br /> <br />Lastly, dont get carried away with that 'stressful' life scenario played again and again in the book. At times, sounds as if these quotes dont apply to a 'normal' working professional.

B0001Z52RU|5.0|After the first 20 minutes i thought i was really going to hate this film (i was enjoying it but was hating what i was seeing - particularly the dog burning as i have grave reservations about depictions of animal cruelty in films). I am glad that i held out and continued watching, this film is a sensitive, well thought-out interpretation of that timeless thought we all have from time to time, how would my life have changed if i had done something differently, at a pivotal moment?<br /><br />In the case of the films main character (superbly played by the actor), things start out at rock bottom, however he realises he has the power (hereditary) to change how his character behaves at pivotal moments of his life, quickly he realises things could have been much worse. We empathise very strongly with all the characters (even the sadistic Tommy) as we understand how they became the way they did. I found it beautifully haunting the transformations which the characters undergo as their histories are changed, born again christian one minute, psychotic madman the next. The director makes a very convincing argument for the nurture over nature debate.<br /><br />The film works on many levels. Because we have half a dozen characters playing many differing manifestations over and over again, we become familiar with, we warm to - the characters. The ending of the film was well done, without degenerating into the typical saccharine Hollywood 'everything is all right now', the movie leaves us feeling...relieved, which is important as the film is mostly depressing and dark throughout. However even in the end the main character has to make a great personal sacrifice for the well being of all, as he realises he cannot make things 'perfect'.

0553573403|2.0|SPOILERS<br /><br />Well, I haven't had an experience this bizarre for a while. All the positive customer and editorial reviews, as well as people I know and respect, tout this as breaking new ground in a tired genre. How's that? If you can't see that the entire backdrop of this book, not to mention most of the characters and events, are lifted from the work of other authors, then you can't have read many other fantasy books at all, let alone literature of any kind.<br /><br />The Stark family and their locale is taken straight from Nordic legends. The Others are bog-standard undead (Ringwraiths, even), who live beyond Hadrian's wall; all the other noble families, if they are elaborated upon at all, are defined mostly by their heraldic devices. There are magical objects (dragon eggs), specially forged swords handed from father to son, you name it. Most unforgivably, the Targaryens, with their violet eyes, dragon fixation, and pale hair and skin, are Melniboneans lifted without alteration from Michael Moorcock's classic Elric series (they even lived on an isle). The secondary characters are all archetypal: from Robert Baratheon, who you will immediately visualise as being played by Brian Blessed, to Varys, the cunning eunuch, Cersei the beautiful-yet-heartless queen, etc, etc, etc.<br /><br />That wouldn't matter if the structure of the story enabled it to find some originality in the telling, but George has failed to get round the problems created by his own experiment. To justify each and every chapter changing POV, it's necessary for each to work as dramatic event by itself. In practice this means most present us with some kind of life-or-death situation that actually has nothing to do with the main plot at all, but is there because otherwise we'd wonder why we'd changed to that character. It almost feels like a TV series - the priority is to ensure you hang on until the next chapter relating to your favorite character, whether or not the cliff-hanger helps the main story. The result is that the impact dwindles each time, until only the most melodramatic situations are capable of arousing much interest by the end of the book. Compare this to LOTR, which opens with two marvellous, adversity-free chapters to establish the plot and background, spends three whole chapters in Lothlorien after Gandalf's fall, and many more pages describing the character's travelling from place to place, and you'll see why this hurts the story - it makes good pacing impossible. However much of a page-turner this novel is, the characters (except Jon and maybe Daenerys) never have any time to breathe.<br /><br />And it's repetitive. Already, we have two mad boy-kings controlled by overbearing mothers; two scenes where a character too young to do anything with the information overhears the Bad People discussing something crucial to the plot. Two morally shady characters relate a sob story from their past to a second character they hardly know. These scenes are not there because they help the story, but to ensure readers sympathise with the characters in question (Sandor and Tyrion). Martin doesn't seem to know how to create complexity without either making his characters inconsistent or weakening them: when Tyrion, who I already liked, related the story of what happened to his first and only love I wanted to scream. People like Tywin Lannister, who are of central importance to major events, remain offstage until they get round to bumping into a POV character, so we never get any insight into them. At the other end of the spectrum, Eddard Stark is supposedly a master stategist who unflinchingly faces How Things Are; but the main plot hinges on him freely informing his arch-enemy that, uh, he's got some dirt on her, so she better watch out - which gives her time to seize power, execute him and trigger a massive war. This is after he's been repeatedly told this will happen by impartial secondary characters. WTF?<br /><br />In some respects reading this book is a mind-boggling experience. I read it quickly and with a certain degree of excitement, yet throughout it's entire length there are only two really 'big' plot developments, neither them exactly surprising in a book (the English edition) with a dragon on the cover called \\"Game Of Thrones\\". Namely: a throne changes hands, and some dragons come back. That's 800 pages. After finishing this installment I read the reviews for the next two - and was stunned to discover that it takes another 2000 pages for the throne to change hands again. And this is going to be a six-book series. No wonder George needs to kill his main characters off - how else is he going to hold anyone's attention through books 4 to 6? It seems that's what 'realism' means for many fans of modern fantasy writing.read it quickly and with a certain degree of excitement, yet throughout it's entire length there are only two really 'big' plot developments, neither them exactly surprising in a book (the English edition) with a dragon on the cover called \\"Game Of Thrones\\".

0553573403|5.0|This book is indeed the best fantasy book I've read lately, and it is second in its quality, in my opinion, only to Weis and Hickman.<br /><br />Martin creates a very realistic and detailed world. It is not surprising, however, since many of its characteristics correspond with our reality. For example The Dotraks are clearly drawn by the lines of the medieval Mongols. He also corresponds with other Fantasy books. The basic idea is well rooted in Fantasy: A seperation between the \\"Good\\" and the \\"Evil\\" worlds that is about to break, the return of an ancient evil, a selected group which is supposed to stop it.<br /><br />Here, however, the similarity ends. This is only the base, on which Martin builds a wonderful tower. His book is much more complicated than any other fantasy book I've ever read (Indeed it might be thought of as a genre in its own right). His world is highly detailed.<br /><br />Masterfuly, Martin creats numerous characters, each and every one of them deep and realistic. He skillfuly manevours between them, without stoping for a moment the reader's interest or understanding.<br /><br />The major difference between this book from most fantasy books is that there is no clear seperation between good and evil. Many of the characters change sides. Other are unaware that their deeds are good or evil. Some can't be determined at all while others are good or bad only when you judge them in comparison to the other characters, but not objectively.<br /><br />I haven't read the rest of the series yet, but this book is pretty much the background. It sets the tools for the rest of the series. It describes the political activities in a kingdom on the verge of war. However, it never fails to show the human side of the involved personals. The reader finds that he can't trust anyone to fulfill his excpectations from it. Characters change as the plot become more complicated. Each has its own interests, but even they change.<br /><br />I have read the 750 pages of the Hebrew version of this book in a week. It's impossible to put it aside. The ending leaves you with eagerness for more, since it stops in the critical moment, where all the tools are set for the great conflict.<br /><br />It is, however, a serious book.

B000002KHF|5.0|I took a chance on this one - I only knew Van from what I've heard on the radio. Nevertheless, in my constant pursuit of great music to listen to, I took an educated risk and bought this one.    \\"How bad could it be\\", I figured? I know half the songs. So, I took it home and turned it on, and my oh my...    What a wonderful CD! Such pure talent - great vocals, intense lyrics, and a backing band second to none. It's an absolute pleasure to listen to this one over and over again while I am at work. Every song stands on it's own merits, yet combined they add up to a collection that stands out as one of the best titles I've ever owned.    Needless to say, I've now got to go back and pick up some of his other earlier titles. I can only hope they are as good this one, because it's sure going to be a hard one to top!
B000068IEU|1.0|I am a Wes Craven fan, and I love thrillers and horror movies.  However, this movie was a big disappointment.  I understand that it was a breakthrough for the genre, but it hasn't aged well at all.  The characters are laughable, the script is Wes Craven's worst (albeit his first), the music is unbearable, and the cinematography/editing is amateurish at best.  There are about 5 minutes of thrills and scares stretched out over 84 minutes.  Rent it if you absolutely must see it, but avoid purchasing it at any price over about 5 bucks.
B000059QY2|2.0|Although this cinematic version of Verdi's Rigoletto would be considered by most movie-goers a \\"B\\" genre work, the music is the only somewhat decent aspect that salvages its otherwise boring and laughable attempt at truly creating a legitimate \\"film.\\" <br /> <br />Luciano Pavarotti (one of the most famous tenors in the last few years to have sung the role of the Duke of Mantua), Ingar Wixell (as Rigoletto), and Edita Gruberova (as Gilda) join forces in what one would assume would be a tour de force cast.  Although Pavarotti sings the role well and easily hits the higher notes, they at times seem a bit dry (as he is prone to doing), without any type of animation or gusto.  Gruberova is an above average Gilda, and she and Pavarotti shine brightest when they are singing together (namely in their Act II duet and the famous quartet in Act III).  Wixell is a light Rigoletto, but he is clearly the most effulgent of the trio as a singing actor; were the viewer to close his or her eyes, almost no emotion or real role portrayal would be felt from anyone except for the baritone.   <br /> <br />But alas, the disastre of this is undoubtedly the acting and final cut of the \\"movie\\" itself.  Some operas turned into works of cinema have worked (e.g., Tosca with Domingo and Malfitano), yet here, the acting is ridiculously overdone, or in the case of Pavarotti (which isn't too unusual for those who have seen him on stage...) is non-existent.  To top it off, the music is almost never matched with the actual movements of the actors' mouths, which results in a stereotypical effect like you would see in a dubbed foreign film.   <br /> <br />To get to the point, this is NOT the Rigoletto to buy if you are looking for a good production.  Skip it---go with the Met production with Domingo/Cotrubas/Diaz or the Covent Garden production with Alvarez/Gavanelli/Schafer.  Either would be a much more enjoyable choice for the seasoned opera fan and the beginner alike.
B000001AJG|5.0|This album forever redefined my look on Stevie Wonder's music.  I've always liked his R&B albums, but this one really illustrates his immense talent for instrumental composition and elegant, classic melodies.  Although people may not agree, my favorite number is \\"Ecclesiastes\\" - its apparent simplicity and outstanding use of minor keys (not to mention the 12/8 meter and some virtuoso synthesizer playing) just seem to overwhelm.  I've played this number to many people who love classical music (but not that familiar with Stevie Wonder) - most of them thought it was written by likes of Nino Rota or Michel Legrand.  They refused to believe it was, in fact, by Stevie.  Many of them asked me to borrow the album and were very impressed. <br />Every number offer surprises.  Simply put, it is a great, great album!!
B00030590I|5.0|<br />\\"Hero\\" is one of my favorite movies. I absolutely loved the story line of the movie and how each layer of memories was played out in such artistic way where color of wardrobe was a significant indicator of the personalities of the characters. The entire cast was also very impressive. Watching the movie is like being in a dream where the reality seeems to fade away a little bit when the story is told.  <br /> <br />I also loved the idea behind the story. Individual sacrfice grants the worldwide peace. The idea is very fitting for current politics.  <br /> <br />Great movie. Go to see it.  <br />

B000002G7G|5.0|While many people consider The Velvet Underground's self-titled release as simpler and less innovative than their breakthrough Velvet Underground and Nico album, I see it as being just as innovative and conceptually interesting as it is musically and lyrically genius. Unlike albums like Loaded and White Light/White Heat, which felt like collections of songs, this self-titled album is just that, a cohesive and unified piece of work. The album unfolds as a life story. The first few tracks are a sort of adolescent coming of age story, with the \\"Jesus\\" track heralding a new epiphany and beginning. \\"That's the story of my life,\\" and \\"The Murder Mystery,\\" is the death stage of the story, with \\"Afterhours\\" being the afterlife. Of course, what really makes the album is not the concept, which many people do not even notice, but the quality of the individual songs. The music itself seems to keep to a variation on a theme, while it's the incredible lyrics that really create the movement of the album. The best VU album.
B000002HK4|4.0|\\"A Change of Seasons\\" contains every quality of Dream Theater's music, compacted into a 23-minute song.  It is a thrilling ride of stunning melodies, and exciting instrumentation.  A while back, I went through this stage where I considered DT to be the be-all, end-all of music itself, largely because I was so obsessed with technical ability at this time.  Well, I've now gotten to the point where pure technical prowess doesn't wow me like it used to (once you've heard all of the fastest and most technical music, it's really not that big of a deal anymore, and you just want excellent songwriting), and as a result, a lot of DT's material (particularly the newer stuff) doesn't hold the same thrill that it once did.<br /><br />However, this song is still as excellent to my ears as it was on the first listen.  Here, you've got the dazzling complexity, but more importantly, you've got great songwriting and melody to balance it out.  There's really no point in this song where it sounds like they're just playing for the hell of it, which is impressive considering it's over 20 minutes long.  The songs on \\"Train of Thought\\" are each no more than half the length of this one, and none of them go by nearly as fast.  This is top-notch musicality that's sorely lacking from a lot of their music today.  John's solos are melodic and imaginative, and even in the faster parts, never cross into wank territory.  Mike's drumming is more compelling, and not as showy and repetitious as it often is today, and Derek's keyboard and piano melodies are just superb.  The only really bad thing about this song is the drum sound, which is kind of weak and hollow.  It sounds like Mike is hitting tin cans, or something.  They need to remaster it, to get a beefier drum sound.<br /><br />But anyway, this is a fantastic epic, full of twists, turns, and great music.  Musically, the band have never sounded better.

A young man is close to a Professor at school, and after graduation they drift apart - until the student learns that the teacher has Lou Gehrig's... Now he returns to see the old man and to receive one last lesson - life's greatest lesson...<br />When I picked it up a knew there would be a good chance I would be bawling by the end... The Quarterback of the University I attend recommended it to me... and he said it was a tearjerker... Well he was right. Few books force the reader to stay up all night to finish. This one does because the reader knows how its going to end and the lesson is to valuable to delay its learning.<br />Buy this book. Buy it today, turn off the TV and the telephone, get a box of Kleenex and prepare to learn.<br /><br />Relic113
0380715430|3.0|As usual, Bryson turns in a thoroughly entertaining book: the man has a positive knack for taking even the most mundane of subjects and unearthing enough intriguing anecdotes and facts that it becomes thoroughly fascinating.  But this time we might have too much of a good thing.  As others have noted, some of the things Bryson claims in this book are perhaps too fascinating to be true.  I don't know that much about linguistics, but even I could recognize some incorrect information in this book -- the \\"Eskimos have X number of words for snow\\" myth being the most prominent.  Of course, one mistake does not ruin a book, but \\"Mother Tongue\\" is riddled with this type of thing.  I challenge anyone to read the chapter on American English and tell me that Bryson isn't citing mostly archaic words in his claims about regional differences in the US.  I showed the book to an Australian friend, and he said that the section on Australian English is also several generations out of date. <br /> <br />Yet for all that, there is still some good information here.  It's a quick and interesting read, in spite of my misgivings about it.  So go ahead and read it and have fun, but be warned not to believe everything Bryson claims.
0812550706|5.0|Not many books surprise me. I knew the idea behind this book and since it had 4.5 stars and over 2000 review, it was time for me to read it. At first I was skeptical how a 6 year old could be this great military genius to combat the invading alien forces. (I still wish he was 10 years old) but Card does a good job of showing Enders emotional weaknesses. I love how he keeps succeeding against all odds in the training academy and they keep raising the bar making each task more and more difficult until the very end when they put him in a no win situation. I did NOT see the ending coming and was pleasantly surprised.<br />Read this book -  even if I think ender is still too young, the clever ending makes it more that 5 out of 5 stars...<br /><br />Relic113
1401300901|4.0|The first work of Cecelia Ahern is a bittersweet story about surviving the loss of a love. Easy and fast to read, it tells about every day life how it has to go on, whatever may interrupt it. It's sad and funny at the same time and changes from one moment to the other - just like real life does. Great to fill the evening hours and to read in any place.
0061020710|4.0|This is the first Discworld novel there is, and coincidently, the first one i have read. I was a little put off by the strange names for many things, but after getting used to them, i quite enjoyed this book. Rincewind and Death were pretty amusing. I think i will scour the used book shops for a few more discworld books as i am not sure that i want to commit to reading all 25 just yet. I am going to try to find some of the more popular ones, and then i will be able to make a more informed decision. I read this because the series is so famous, but i am not sure that i can make a judgement just yet as top if i am hooked or not. That being said about my long term feelings, i definatly thought that this book was worth reading, even for a person not likely to read the series. It was a nice change to have characters in a fantasy world who were not too serious about portraying the world as dark and dreary...find a copy of this book and read it on a rainy day...
B00007G207|5.0|The original shorter release will go down as one of the best movies of all time.  The longer one is only worth seeing to see the unfathomable transformation of a melancholy almost beautiful work of art to a sad testament of a sinful, selfish race of dysfunctional elders and personal decisions. Though both have truth in them, the long version is more like a 3 star movie that the director can't clarify the main theme/s or there are too many to experience as a viewer.     <br /> <br />The short movie is the ultimate cinema expression of the mentor, mom and young man's sacrifices to fulfill the ultimate growth and expression in what area/art form you love and are gifted at.  <br /> <br />The startling difference between the two cuts is the stark transition of the loving self-sacrificing mentor into a selfish, bitter man, living his dream through the young man and playing God, sacrificing the young man's life and relationships in the small town. This transition of the hero of the first version is very hard to take for those who saw the short version first as myself. The mother of the young man's girlfriend reinforces this theme of older adults doing what they think is best for their children/proteges. Parallel themes are often powerful, but in this case too much outrage for the viewer to take.  I would like to hear from anyone who saw them in reverse order to see if the old man can be seen as unselfish after the long version. <br /> <br />It is also a poignant example of an elder leading their loved protege to a place they can fullfill both their dreams or maybe even as the long version shows the elder's dreams. <br /> <br />They have done us a great favor packaging them together, but I would watch the short version 2 times then the long once and then I would never watch the long one again. <br /> <br />
B00068IOWM|4.0|The Good<br /><br />The opening track \\"Vertigo\\" starts off with a catchy distorted riff and leads into an even catchier chorus.  And yes, I'm puzzled about the whole 1-2-3-14 thing too.  Bono has never been one to back down from expressing his feelings of love, and \\"Miracle Drug\\" is no different.  It's amazing how The Edge's simple guitar notes make a big difference.  \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own\\" is another mid-tempo track that mixes acoustic chords with electric embellishments.<br /><br />\\"Love and Peace or Else\\" has a funky seventies groove to it, with its pounding drumbeat and trippy guitar work. The slight distortion that The Edge uses on \\"All Because Of You\\" is just as effective as if they were heavier.  His solo is full of melody and soul.  Bono chimes in just as smooth and melodic as he always is.  Even though \\"A Man and a Woman\\" is a mellow track, the lyrics and vocals are quite powerful.  This would be my pick for the next radio single.  \\"One Step Closer\\" features a subtle music section while it features Bono's emotional lyrics.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />The first single released to radio \\"Vertigo\\" doesn't really represent the felling of the album.  It's the heaviest, rocking song on the album.  Everything else is mellow.<br /><br />The Verdict<br /><br />Another classic U2 album!  Plenty of catchy rhythms and thought-provoking lyrics.
B00018D3RI|5.0|It's good set and has 23 episodes of the show. My favorite episode is episode 2 Savage Sunday where a senior-citizen couple put 50 sticks of dynamite in the back of their White Impala to blow up city hall but 2 homicidal thieves Wilbur Sloan and Gregg Morton steal their car and don't know that there are dynamite in the trunk. Things get kind of worse when they take it to Ted's Body & Fender repair shop and paint the Chevy green and change the plates to Ohio plates. And another good one is episode 14 The Deadly Imposter where Starsky & Hutch's long lost buddy returns to town dressed as a General who is actually contracted to kill his ex-wife's husband. So those are good episodes. The one I didn't like was Running, that was a pretty sad one too when an alchoholic model who Starsky was in love with in High School was almost killed by a loose killer but when Starsky hides her in his apartment to protect her, she's the only person to identify the killer. But anyway, I got this on my birthday which was on December 9 along with SNL Adam Sandler. I finished watching the entire 5 disc set. It says it's 20 hours this 5-piece-disc set. And also on the 5th disc, it has special features like new interviews with Starsky & Hutch, pictures of the movie Starsky & Hutch and also talking about the 3rd star which is Starsky & Hutch's Red & White Ford Torino. And I saw another Ford Torino in one of the episodes, I can't remember which episode that was but I think it was episode 16 The Hostages. But anyway this is a good set. After you watch this one, you'll probably be wanting for the 2nd Season. I haven't seen the 2nd Season yet but I bet it's good and I think it's out now.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|A lot of people wonder which era this movie takes place in. The clothes, the music, the technology. Fact is, this movie captures perfectly the atmosphere of small town U.S.A. in any decade. For that, it's timeless. <br />Napoleon will remind you of at least one of your K-12 chums (where are they now?). He's no hero, but it is fun to watch him blunder through a bad couple of days. Surrounded by familiar characters that almost need no introduction (Uncle Rico, a study in casting/character acting perfection), he sets off on an explosive, action packed effects extraviganza. <br />Well, maybe not, but the fact that you can almost smell the tater tots and soiled elasto/parachute/hammer pants makes this a trip down memory lane. Any more, I enjoy getting thrown a curve ball when I go see a movie. Napoleon Dynamite satisfied that, and should be considered among the great works of restrained, simplistic, comedic genius. <br />Don't forget to stick around after the credits for the second happy ending.  <br />
B00005JNBQ|1.0|i had extremely high expectations. have you ever been conned out of one hour and  a half of stupidity. i didn't even watch the whole thing. it's that bad.

B0000542D2|5.0|BUY THIS MOVIE NOW. That's all I have to say. It has the humor of every single Beatle, and it ROCKS. Paul's grandfather is really funny, and the way they handle him cracks me up. This movie is A CLASSIC. IT IS A MUST NEED. It has hit songs AND awesome quotes. Buy it. It's worth every penny. <br />\\"I now declare this bringe open.\\" -John <br />\\"If you've lost him, I'll cripple ya!\\" -Paul <br />\\"You're a grown man and you've never used a safety razor?!\\" -George <br />\\"But I'm Ringo Starr!

Buy it for the comedy, music, quotes AND to see those wonderful boys at it again! (and don't forget about their Liverpool accents!!)
B00005LC3Y|5.0|this is my all time favorite war movie. it is powerful and shocking. i think everyone should see this and get a good cry.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|I haven't laughed out loud at a movie in a long time...or at least with stuff that has been made in 2004.<br /><br />1) Very funny in the typical witty dialogue of English comedy<br /><br />2) HUGE amounts of F-bombs and other profanities that may turn some folks off. Just letting you know it's there, if you care.<br /><br />3) Kind of seemed to go from funny to serious later in the movie. I wanted more funny stuff but settled even though it was a bit disappointing<br /><br />4) One scene, in particular, was very gory even for my desensitized condition. It was completely done for shock value.<br /><br />5) I felt like the pace was kept up and didn't lag in any place or feel rushed trying to force an adrenaline rush in the viewer.<br /><br />6) No Oscar nominations for acting, direction, cinematography or whatnot. But it was a solidly put together movie overall.<br /><br />OVERALL I liked it a lot and if I was to have a late night movie watch with some friends (no kids around) I'd probably have this as one of the listed suggestions for us to veg to, as we fade to sleep in front of the TV

B00005JN0T|4.0|I'm sure I'm like the masses who thought this may be a movie version of the classic sci-fi novel by Asimov. I'm happy to report that this move makes no attempt to mimic the book and thus doom the movie to everlasting Hell like Battelfied Earth.<br /><br />1) Great action<br /><br />2) Nice special effects<br /><br />3) Good mystery story with effective red herrings<br /><br />4) The whole Will Smith hip-hop thing in the year 2300 or whatever year it was seemed out of place and forced. This is my only complaint...oh wait, one more complaint<br /><br />5) What is up with the director having to try and flaunt Will Smith's physique?!? Shower scene, running around in briefs, a woman caressing his bare chest...is this some lame attempt to draw the female crowd into an action flick?<br /><br />6) Content was unnecessary as they threw a bunch of S-bombs and other profanities. They could have gotten an easier rating and made it more kid friendly if they would have just kept it cleaner.<br /><br />OVERALL: I liked it a lot and was pleasantly surprised
B0000DZ3EA|4.0|I bought this CD just for Solsbury Hill.  The song is in Vanilla Sky which is one of the all time greatest movies.  Every time I hear Solsbury Hill I think of that crazy movie.  I've played the song and the movie lots of times and never get tired of either one.  Peter Gabriel is one in a million.
0451528018|5.0|Having never read any Sherlock Holmes before, or any mystery novels besides Nancy Drew, I picked this up one day for a quick read. I was pleasantly surprised, I ended up finishing it in one sitting because it was so exciting. The story centers around a curse haunting an ancient family on the moor, which involves a spooky black hound and plenty of strange people.<br /><br />While others might complain about the time Doyle spends on the setting, I thought it added greatly to the spookiness. It takes place on the moor, which is a dreary enough place already, but Doyle adds in other details that give the moor as sinister quality. Now that I have read other Sherlock stories I can see that none of them devote as much time to the setting, but the setting here is also an important part of the story.<br /><br />The thing that many readers will find strange is the actual absence of Sherlock Holmes himself from much of the story, with Watson narrating and doing much of the investigating. However, I thought this added even more mysteriousness to the story, as there is an entire piece missing until you catch up with Sherlock. There are plenty of other good characters in this story as well, something missing from short stories that tend to focus solely on Holmes and Watson.<br /><br />This is a great introduction to Sherlock Holmes, as well as an exciting story. Of course the language can be archaic and the story is complex, but it's not anything anyone older than 12 can't handle. If you like Hound of the Baskervilles, you'll also enjoy any of the Holmes short stories too

0375757260|5.0|Vanity Fair is not a book for the casual reader. It will probably always be neglected in schools and will be unread by those without patience. However, if you are willing to devote yourself to reading this long novel, it is well worth it.  <br /> <br />The main characters that the story centers around are Becky and Amelia, two girls who are polar opposites, yet their lives intertwine in fascinating ways. In many ways they are caricatures, but the book is long enough to give them complexity and in the end you have two unexpectedly interesting and multifaceted characters. Of course they are not the only characters, there are probably 500 more of various importance. Some readers may have difficulty keeping track of them all, especially when several have the same last name. However, Thackeray manages to keep focus through all the characters and it ends up that there are only about a dozen major characters, all very well developed.   <br /> <br />The story itself is concerned mainly with the relationships and wealth of Amelia and Becky, but there are as many subplots as there are characters. Occasionally the story becomes stagnant, but there are enough stories and settings that I never became bored. The influence of the Napoleonic Wars is much stronger in Vanity Fair than in any of Austen's novels, which creates some interesting settings such as the battle of Waterloo, as battle that has a profound influence on the story. There is plenty of humor in the story as well and also Thackeray's famous societal commentary. This makes having notes in the book important, as there are references to events, places, languages, and things that a modern reader would normally not be familiar with.  <br /> <br />This is a long book and the beginning isn't much fun to read, but it is interesting and insightful once you get into it. The setting might be over a hundred years ago, but the people in it are not outdated and their motivations and characters will seem familiar to the modern reader. Whether or not someone would like this novel comes down to if one can get past the length, archaic language, obscure references, and number of stories and characters. It certainly took me awhile and I almost stopped reading it, but I came to care for the characters enough that I began enjoying it.
B0001HAHXW|2.0|Now don't get me wrong, I love Robert Johnson Covers, but to devote a whole album to it is just insane. There is barley even any artistic expresion on this album, its just trying to make Robert Johnson sound modern, but there is only one Robert Johnson. Now when Clapton did Crossroads, it was cool because it actually sounded like he put some work into that Johnson song, but the songs on this album is just what Johnson did with a Chicago/British blues feel to it.
B000003TA4|5.0|I am 52, female and a music buff since my first transistor radio back in the Stone Age. Of all the bands, over all the years, Nirvana is the one that speaks to me most. Yeah, Nevermind sparked a sorely needed musical 'revolution' but if it had not, this album would STILL have been the best record of the 90's. Kurt Cobain's raw vocals and painfully astute lyrical observations express that dark yearning we all have buried whether we like to admit it or not. Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic add perfect steaming intensity; a foundation that burns like the fire beneath a cannibal cauldren. Melody is the center of Cobain's songs, no matter if he drones, screams or rages, and Novaselic's baseline is the sweet underpinning that gives this music weight and symmetry. And as Kurt said about Grohl when he joined the band \\"He can't dance as good as your MTV favorites, but he beats the drums like he's beating the s--t out of their heads.\\" Nevermind ain't surface stuff; ya really gotta LISTEN. I suggest car stereo, full blast, long drive down a deserted highway...
B0002OERI0|5.0|...dickwads.    I was flicking through some of the reviews for Green Day's American Idiot which I own and happen to think is an extremely fine album. Now most of these were OK - some good critiques, but I came across the following:    \\"I never really cared for Green Day, but this album proved to me that they suck. They are a one hit wonder, that some how stuck around. Just another band playing off the anti-Bush swing, they are probably Michael Moore's *** lovers. People really need to get better taste in music, because if more bands like this are able hang around for so long, we will be in some big trouble.\\"    What a ****ing arsepiece. He's never liked them so he slags off the album because of a political viewpoint. Oh, and does this [...] actually realise Green Day were around before Bush? No, didn't think so.    Here's some more pearls of wisdom from a different reviewer:    \\"I've always hated this band... ultimately trite pop music in spite of their anti-hero garage image. There was a time when people appreciated musicianship even in mainstream music, and had an attention span that lasted longer than three chords. I think Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree sang it best... \\"Music of the future will not entertain, It's only meant to repress and neutralize your brain.\\" \\"    Shut the **** up you arty farty tree hugging pinko [...]! If you don't like the band, WHY ARE YOU LISTENING TO IT? Jesus, just east some tofu and die, you ****.    Here's a hint, guys: If you don't like a band or a genre, don't buy the album. It's that simple. No-one will give a **** about your stupid opinions so keep them to yourselves. and save yourself from looking like a ****.
B000002IHD|5.0|This album is everything that all the acclaim has stated it to be and more. This album captures Otis at his rawest. Each song is immortalized by an achingly powerful perfomace by Redding. Booker T. and the MG's demonstrate constantly why they are held as the greatest house band in history. True it may be comprised of several singles but that does not take away from the sheer force and totality of this masterpiece. It encompasses the very essense of not only Otis Redding but deep soul in general. Whether he's singing heartbreaking despair in the form of \\"Ole Man Trouble\\" or rousing near franctic up-tempo numbers like Sam Cooke's classic \\"Shake\\" the raw intensity never fails. I have two complaints about this album though. One,It should have had at least one more deep soul ballad and the second, though very small, is that \\"I've Been Loving You Too Long\\" should have followed \\"A Change Is Gonna Come.\\" By having \\"Down In the Valley\\" follow 'Change' it shifts too fast from the deep power of Redding's take of the classic. Overall this album deserves to be higher than the superlatives have hailed it. If you love this and deep soul in general get James Carr's \\"You Got My Mind Messed Up.\\" These are two of the deepest albums in history, Carr's, in my opinion, is more intense. Absolutely Essential :o)

B0001ZMWQO|5.0|When i first bought this record i wondered wether it would be as good as it was hyped up to be...well, long story short, it was all that and more. Infusing Catchy pop hooks, clever lyrics, haunting melodys, and new wave flavor to indie rock Franz Ferdinad has made one of the most amazing records of the 21st century. Franz Ferdinand's self titled debut starts out with the with the catchy, but haunting melody of JAQUELINE and soon leads into TELL HER TONIGHT a new wave song, that has a 60's era rock chourus, then comes the albums strongpoint and first single TAKE ME OUT wich is purely indie rock at it's finest, THE DARK OF THE MATINEE(my personal favorite of the album) is so clever in its construction with lyrics and music combined this is almost worthy of comparison to great songs like \\"Imagine\\" or \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", following that comes AUF ACHSE a simple song with simple lyrics and music. CHEATING ON YOU is an excellent song that puts fake rock bands like G.C. and New Found Glory in thier place with a pure rock vibe that even the biggest meatalhead would enjoy,THIS FIRE follows and is so intresting in its construction that it will leave you with just a few breaths in you, after that comes DARTS OF PLEASURE wich is new wave indie rock at its core and is refreshingly different, MICHAEL is alot like CHEATING ON YOU in contrast that it is pure rock, COME ON HOME is like JAQUELINE in the contrast that its haunting melodies and tremendous lyrics are the main draws to the song, and last of all comes the incredible closure 40' which is a calm, yet energized song that is done in 1970's fashion. Well I hope my review will help you in your descicion, but in the meantime...LONG LIVE FRANZ FERDINAND!
B000002MUW|2.0|I am a huge Madonna fan as you can tell by my reviews, but seriously what happened here?  Madonna only makes good music so I was so shocked about how bad this CD was.  Some songs don't even sound like it's her. It's not the Madonna that I am used to listening to. Here is a review Survival, ok this one is not that bad but not that good either, I give it a 3.  Secret is the best song on here and the real Madonna, I give it a 5.  I love the guitar sounds in the beginning, and the great upbeat tempo, and the good message \\"happiness lies in your own hand\\" which is so true. I'd Rather Be Your Lover, really bad I give it a 1, Inside Of Me, bad I give it a 1.  Human Nature, not good either, a 2.  Only 2 things I like about this song and here they are.  This songs she gets back at her critics that panned her during her sex era.  I loved in the song how she gets back at them for that and the good message 'express yourself don't repress yourself\\". Forbidden Love,  bad 1 star. The one on Confessions On A Dance Floor is so good so you can't even compare it to this one ( They are both totally different by the way)  listen to that one instead it will blow you away it's so good.  Love Tried To Welcome Me,  bad 1 star, Sanctuary, bad 1 star, Bedtime Story which was is really good and was \\"given\\" to her by Bjork, 4.5. It has a great unique sound to it completely different than the whole album itself. Take A Bow, I know it went to number 1 but I just don't like it, it's a ballad but it is not good at all.  The remixes of Take A Bow are actually better than the original song.  Basically the music is not good at all and you can't dance to them, except for Secret ( not really a dance song but the remixes are, you can dance to them) and Bedtime Stories, and a little to Survival. Half the songs are good lyrically and there are some good messages. Madonna may have not even produced it maybe that's why it's not that good or her producers weren't that good. People say American Life is bad that get's a B+ and blows this out of the water. I give this a D+. Sorry Madonna I love you and all your other CD's but not this one. Check out Confessions On A Dance Floor all the songs blow me away they are so good.  If you like good messages about life and some good lyrics then I recommend it, otherwise stay away. The videos from this CD are great though.
B000002UAU|5.0|Sgt. Peppers Lonley Heart's Club Band is quite possibly the most influential album of all time and is just as relevant and fantastic as it ever was. Every song on this album is lyrically and musically creative and astonoshing. The album's spirit is undeniable as many today still see it as the most innovative album of the 20th century. I reccomend this album to anyone who wants to listen to an album that has influenced countless bands over the years. I hope this review has helped you come to a descion. Thank You for reading my review.
B000002N3J|3.0|This compilation of new and old  ballads is pretty good.  I especially like the old ones the best. You'll See is the only new one that I think is absolutely beautiful and sends a great message about not needing anyone else to help us. Impling we are strong people and we can do anything on our own.   She sings \\"all by myself I dont need anyone at all I know I'll survive I know I'll stay alive\\" and \\"I'll stand on my own\\". which got me to think of what she was impling.     Something To Remember is really good to and is off of the I'm Breathless album and tells you to \\"love yourself\\" another good message.  Madonna included a lot of her slow songs that went to #1.  This Used to Be My Playground, Crazy For You, Live To Tell, Take A Bow. The other ones that I love ( except for Take A Bow) are  Rain,  I'll Remember, Crazy for You, Live To Tell, and this This Used To Be My Playground.   I highly recommend this CD if you want to hear the old ballads nicely compiled.I don't like  Forbidden Love, Once More Chance, and I Want you, just not good enough. I dont feel the real emotion in Madonna voice singing these songs as she did with other songs.  The highlight has to be You'll See in which her vocals have never sounded any better and the music is absolutely stunning and powerful. Everything else is great though. I highly recommend this to Madonna fans!!!
B000002UB3|4.0|In my opinion, The Beatles were the band that kickstarted rock and roll into a new direction and I have always been astonished by their incredible musical and lyrical talents and have loved and enjoyed all of their works(some more than others) and this is a prime example of geinus at hand. HOWEVER, some of the songs on this albumn are ridiculus and baisically cheap fillers. Now there is no denying that this album is incredible with songs like Come Together, Something, and Here Comes The Sun; but some of the songs are just not worth your time(I Want You,Because, Her Majesty, and Sun King are the only ones) but the GREAT songs on the album make up for all of the lyrical blunders of this album so you feel as if the album is great after all. In other words, lyrical and musical blunders don't slow the album down too much; so i do reccomend it(but if i were you i would much prefer to listen to Revolver or White Album). Thanks for reading my review and i hope it helps you in your decsion making.
0393035158|1.0|Is it prejudice under the guise of enlightenment or just a freethinker's reasoning gone awry?<br /><br />  I am an atheist and I am a humanist. I certainly understand the hazards and threats that religiosity poses in our world. In fact, I whole-heartedly hope that there would truly be an \\"end of faith\\", any faith. But please, for the sake of truth and humanity, let us not replace faith (a mixture of myth and unreasonable certitude) with prejudice, racism and arrogance. To make this concise, why did Mr. Harris open his book with a portrait of an Islamic radical? Why not open it with the portrait of any radical (Muslim or not)? Why not mention the orthodox Jewish youth who assassinated Rabin, or the illegal settlers who are prompted by religious arrogance to usurp Palestinian lands, which eventually leads to the repugnant retribution Mr. Harris opens his book with? Why not mention Christian radicals who think that there should not be privacy in our bedrooms and that there should not be condom use to prevent AIDS, and that abstinence with more prayers constitute the solution to our world's ills? What about Hindu radicals who periodically carry on pogroms against Muslim Indians? Mr. Harris is perhaps not religious. Still, he seems to favor one faith over the other; this is an impression that immediately discredits his arguments.<br /><br />  Is Sam Harris an Israeli apartheid apologist (arrogant and racist by inference) who's trying to stealthily promote the expansionistic and brutal policies of Israel-condemned by the international community....oh but the international community does not matter because they're anti-Semitic and they're just too French--regardless of its human rights violations against the uprooted Arabs?<br /><br />  He's either that or he's an author who, due to a lack of respect of other people's human rights because they do not look like us, have tarnished a highly ethical public message that is greatly needed these days: it is the message that calls for an abandonment of war, myth, religion and religiosity and an embrace of peace, science, reason and freethinking in their stead.<br /><br />  Sam Harris singled out Muslim radicals (by inference, mostly but not entirely Arabs). However, we must not single out Mr. Harris himself: it has become fashionable for authors to intelligently denounce Arabs and Muslims in order to garner the social and financial endorsement of an American elite that is predominantly unconditionally supportive of Israel, at the expense of the human rights and economic interests our country tries to promote.<br /><br />  These days, we need real freethinkers who are free from political agendas? We need audacious intellectuals who can stand in the face of power. Power in the form of both political and religious rights, as they are often interconnected. We need pundits who are independent and who argue objectively, as opposed to speaking for this or that lobby; this or that organization. Only then, we can rise above and beyond the manmade boundaries that prevent world peace, prosperity and harmony.s the message that calls for an abandonment of war, myth, religion and religiosity and an embrace of peace, science, reason and freethinking in their stead. <br />          Sam Harris singled out Muslim radicals (by inference, mostly but not entirely Arabs).

B0006284JQ|5.0|Since her inaugurative album, \\"...Baby One More Time,\\" Britney has gone through an undeniably scintillating career.  Having caught almost every listener demographic in her sometimes hypnotizing, always fun beats and lyrics, Britney has established herself-if as anything-as a successful artist.  Her voice, sometimes harsh, abrupt, and seemingly exploding with emotion, isn't any choir's aspiration, but hits and flows into her choruses with power, aggression, and playful fun.  The synth beats and dynamic inherent in every song is enough to make each single seem new and innovative instead of redundant and dull.   <br /> <br />For those who have yet to have bought a Britney album or are looking for the one CD that encompasses all of the Britney singles, this album is for you.  Though the cover of Bobby Brown's \\"My Perogative\\" is a good track, it hardly warrants the price of a full album.   <br /> <br />There's not much to say about the rest:  this album is made up of unique and incredibly enjoyable tracks that defined pop music for five straight years. This pinacle ablum should be on everyone's CD rack.
B000002KOQ|5.0|Joni Mitchell gets inside your own mind and heart by delivering her own.  This is, by far, my favorite work by this artist.  It's melodies are unique and reach depths I have not heard elsewhere.  Mature, yet innocent, beautiful yet poignant... I am imediately transported to the secret places of my soul while listening to this recording.  In many ways Joni Mitchell's uncanny understanding of humanity and her ability to channel it into her music has shaped many lives and allowed us to be open.  Ladies of the Canyon is an essential recording for all brave idealists.  Once you connect dots with Joni you will never forget where she has taken you.

B00005JNEI|4.0|Saw it in the theatres and picked up the DVD.  This is one of those that you either love or love to hate.  Yes it is a 1 sided pictorial of Bush, then again who doesn't love to pick on the Prez. <br /> <br />The thing is without movies like these, then people will never think for themselves and go along with what the government thinks is best, which is not always the case.  But it also makes you wonder what was covered up by the Bush administration and will we ever be able to see it, or locked away like the Kennedy files. <br /> <br />Back and to the lefttttt.......... <br />
0471267554|4.0|am an RN who has had an interest in nutrition for many years, and have eaten similar to the \\"Paleo\\" way for some time and have felt great for years (and look younger than my age!). The big excitement for me is the improvement in my family's health since converting to Paleo. My sister (who has been on chemo for 6 years),found this book(and told us all about it), has lost 35 pounds in 6 months, and has improving lab values with her thyroid, cholesterol. She has increased energy, no indigestion, and glows in a way she never did before. My husband, recently diagnosed with Type II diabetes, has lost 20 pounds in 3 months, and his blood sugars are totally controlled by this diet alone, and his blood pressure is now within normal limits. My daughter, having stopped the dairy products and wheat, is not longer suffering from severe reflux. She never has to take medication for that now. Ever. My mother has lost 33 pounds, has increased mobility and strength, easily controlled blood sugars (may go off meds soon, with md's supervision), and is never hungry. Along with all these benefits, you don't ever have to go hungry again.  <br />Since I have been on this diet, all the cravings for junk food have gone. I was someone who lived for sugar and now I do not want any of it. I use to crave coffee in the morning as well but realized I didn't want that wired up feeling & acid stomach. I switched over to a caffeine-free coffee substitute made from soyabeans I found on the net at [...] S o y c o f f e e.c om. It so easy for someone to tell you to eat less, but if you are craving bad foods, eventually you will fail. In the first five days I was on this diet all the craving ceased and I was already 8 lbs down. If you were like me and cannot wait for your next slice of cake and at the same time really want to change your lifestyle, Try this. <br />
B000002P7R|5.0|Dont let the bad cover (Laughs) fool you. THe music inside is very good and i can tell it was made later in Jimi's career because it is a little more Jazzy and guitar oriented then his earlier stuff. All of the songs are very great, but it has none of his hits which is OK with me cuz i hear them too much anyways. Buy this if you are a Hendrix fan, like me.
B00004XOWM|1.0|But I just can't really listen to this album. A friend of mine left the CD at my apartment and i thought...\\"What the hell. I'll give it a spin for the hell of it.\\" And ya know what? I had to take the CD out by the time it got to track 6(Rollin[Air Raid Vehicle])! I'll make this short: If you want to take a look at something by Limp Bizkit, borrow an album first just in case you get disapointed. And if you do, start with their debut, Three Dollar Bill Ya'll, that album (to my suprise) I found half way decent. So yeah there's my outlook on \\"Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water\\" and to the fans, hope you enjoy it. <br /> <br />P.S.- I'd like to give thanks to the guy who finally said something about that Brandon Welts \\"Psycho\\" guy! He was getting on my f***in' nerves! Thats it Cya
B0000AGQ6Y|5.0|The Superbit version has the same extra scenes as the \\"Uncut International Version\\".  Amazon has it accurately labeled, but the packaging is not obvious.  Both are 133min instead of 110min.  The non-Superbit version has a couple extras like theatrical trailers and talent files.  If you want those extras, get the non-Superbit version.  If you don't care about those extras and are more of a quality freak, get the Superbit version.  The film content is the same either way.<br /><br />Two scenes deal with Leon buying a dress for Mathilda.  One shows Mathilda threatening to possibly kill herself (Russian roulette) to force Leon to admit he cares about her.  There is a scene showing Leon taking Mathilda on her first cleaning job.  Another involves Leon taking Mathilda to an upscale restaurant, and Mathilda makes a minor scene trying to kiss Leon and drinking champagne.  Then there is a sequence where Leon takes Mathilda on a series of cleaning jobs.  In a later scene, Mathilda implies that she wants Leon to be her \\"first\\", and then Leon tells her the story of his first love (and first cleaning job), and Mathilda gets Leon to concede to start sleeping (only literally) with her.<br /><br />Most of the extra scenes start at around 68min.  They are integrated smoothly and are fully finished; it sounds like these scenes were in the original theatrical release for European markets, so they're only \\"extra\\" to the U.S.  If you appericate the film, the extended version is definitely worth it.
B000067J1H|5.0|This is a great movie starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton.The title really threw me. I thought it would just be another poorly made movie relying on names for success, but I was very wrong and pleasantly surprised. The performances are great and the twists are unexpected. So watch this movie you wont be disapointed.
B00005JNEI|4.0|This is an astonishing film; it is astonishing because of Moore's courage to expose president Bush and his present cronies' blatant connection to corporate America, making loads of money from the spoils of the Iraqi war, (these connections are a matter of public record). It is sickening to realize that these so-called leaders are making a disgusting amount of money from the deaths of American boys and innocent Iraqi children. Further to this, the insidious method this administration applied through the media, the out-right propaganda, to justify attacking a sovereign country, spreading fear about terrorism and placing Iraq in the \\"terrorist mix\\", when Iraq does not have weapons of mass destruction, nor are hiding terrorists and have done nothing to the American people, was blatant dishonesty and frightening in every sense of the word. The Bush family are connected to the bin Laden family, also public record. (Their business partners for goodness sake!) It is also public record that the only people allowed to fly, when the whole country was grounded and on red alert after 9'11, was the bin Laden family. Before the smoke even cleared after the destruction of the Twin Towers in New York, the bin Laden family was high tailing out of town, with the approval from the Bush administration - also public record. It has been three years since 9'11, and the masterminds behind and responsible for this terrible act of terror, Osama bin Laden in particular, has never been brought to justice. Why? Have we forgotten about this man, is he no more a threat to us, or has he been conveniently swept under the rug, lost behind the smoke of the (unnecessary) Iraq war? The answer to this question is a simple one: money, lots of money, and its Saudi Arabian money.<br /><br />Australians were lied to as well. Our media has never really taken our prime minister to task about Iraq. The only reason, the main reason, our prime minister sent Australian troops to Iraq was the threat of WMD'S. Well there were never any weapons, but our politicians, like Las Vegas magicians, divert our attention with one hand, while doing something else in the other - slight of hand. Our media should be ashamed of themselves, because journalism is no more about truth but about pushing the party line. People are dieing and those at the top are making millions and the media continue to focus our attentions away from this ghastly reality. Sadly, however, looking at the election results, we continue to buy the lies, hook, line and sinker.<br /><br />Michael Moore had an obvious agenda when making this film. Although his filmmaking style can come across as \\"biased\\", too one sided, the bottom line is that the facts speak for themselves. Our mainstream media are in business to make money and not to expose the truth. So it is fortunate we have individuals like Michael Moore who care enough and have the courage to tell the real story or at least point out the red flags that continue to pop up in this whole mess.<br /><br />This is a confronting film and one everyone should see.ere never any weapons, but our politicians, like Las Vegas magicians, divert our attention with one hand, while doing something else in the other - slight of hand.

B0002SROSQ|5.0|Ever since the release of The Boatman's Call, Nick Cave has been subjected to a slew of criticism regarding his having \\"gone soft,\\" \\"sold out,\\" or what-have-you.  I'll grant that the change from the demonic energy of Let Love In or Murder Ballads was pretty dramatic, but I've never had much of a problem with the \\"new\\" style -- and I find No More Shall We Part to be a work of absolute genius.  However, it is certain that Nocturama was probably the tamest Bad Seeds album yet, dominated by ballads and only occasionally punctuated by outbursts like \\"Dead Man in my Bed.\\"  This is all well and good, but there is no question that the Bad Seeds are a very tight and intense group, and it makes little sense to rein them in too much. <br /> <br />All this climaxed in the departure of integral Bad Seed Blixa Bargeld, German avant-guitarist and frontman of industrial band Einsturzende Neubauten.  Quite frankly, when I heard some pre-realeased sound clips from Abattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus, I couldn't hear much besides some gospel choir singing and a few segments of Nick going on about wistaria and juniper, and I sadly assumed that Bargeld was the only person keeping the band's \\"edginess\\" together, and that Abattoir/Lyre would be little more than Nocturama's weakest cuts spread out over two, agonizing albums. <br /> <br />Fortunately, I couldn't have been more wrong.  The only thing Bargeld's departure seems to have done is convince Mick Harvey to add some chaotic Blixa-esque touches to his guitar work, and Cave himself is clearly at a songwriting peak.  Chanelling the sense of bifurcation that made Nocturama seem a little unbalanced, Nick and the Seeds put most of the rambunctious songs on one CD (Abattoir Blues) and the ballads on the other (The Lyre of Orpheus).  This is not nearly so bad an idea as it seems; there are no real problems with variety.   <br /> <br />The first CD begins strongly with the gospel-tinged \\"Get Ready for Love.\\"  Nick doesn't introduce the gospelchoir gradually, by any means; they're booming \\"Praise Him!\\" within the first couple of seconds.  I have to admit, the gospel-choir sound is an acquired taste; fortunately, considering music of this quality, it's not terribly difficult to acquire.  Not all the songs on Abattoir are quite so rumbustious as this opener (the excellent Cannibal's Hymn, for instance) but the tone is generally intense.  My vote for best cut goes to Hiding All Away -- this brilliant piece of songwriting starts quietly, tension gradually winding as Nick's voice alternates with blazing guitars, the whole thing ending with Cave and the entire choir shouting \\"there is a war coming.\\"  Awesome stuff. <br /> <br />The Lyre of Orpheus is supposed to be the \\"quiet\\" album, but the title track/opener is anything but quiet.  The song is funny in a dark way, but I can't quite tell what Cave is trying to say; the way in which he makes Orpheus into a figure of horror and destruction seems to question the validity of musical creation at all.  Fascinating lyrics.  Tracks 3 and 4 -- \\"Breathless\\" and \\"Babe, You Turn Me On\\" -- are my favorite from this CD until the closer, \\"O Children,\\" which is probably the best song on either CD.  It is perfectly paced, the lyrics are glorious, and the conclusion is absolutely transcendent.  Don't miss this. <br /> <br />It's true, a few of the songs on each CD tend to sound like slightly less inspired versions of the better cuts; but this sort of thing is nearly inevitable on double albums.  I don't know if Nocturama should be called a misstep, but even so, Abattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus is an astonishing \\"return to form.\\"  At the price for which this double album is being sold, it ought not be missed.
B000002H2H|5.0|I LOVE this Album to Death! The entire thing is a Masterpiece from The fast paced \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\" to the chilling yet beautiful \\"Call of Ktulu\\" The classic songs on this album have to be \\"fight Fire With Fire\\", \\"Ride the Lightning\\" and \\"Call of Ktulu\\" Be prepared Metalheads because this ones a powerhouse!
B00005JMAH|4.0|The third Harry Potter is by far my favorite of the series. It is the first one to get the right feel for Hogwarts and the wizarding world--everything finally *feels* magical. The paintings finally move like they are supposed to and the lighting makes the sets feel much more cozy. Prisoner was the first movie filmed on location in Scotland and you really notice the difference--the outdoor shots are beautiful and create the perfect mood. The new setting does create a disconnect--suddenly Hagrid's hut has moved from the lawn to the edge of a cliff which is disconcerting. Also, I am not a fan of the new Dumbledore. He seems flighty rather than wise.    The major problem, however, is the plot. I didn't think the first two movies caught the spirit and feeling of the books very well, but they got enough of the basic plot points in so that the movies made sense on their own. In Prisoner, the major plot points just aren't there. The director wanted to focus on Harry's character development and inner turmoil, which is fine, except you can't forget that this is primarily a mystery story which requires careful plotting. Major plot points simply disappear. The big confrontation scene is short and leaves out key information. I love the books and have read them multiple times, so I knew what was going on. But my Dad has only watched the movies; he enjoyed the first two on their own, but was very confused by this one. It wouldn't have been hard to expand the climax scene to include the important information and to give Harry time to understand and react to it in a reasonable way. The third book was longer than the first two, but the third movie is considerably shorter than the first two. They could have added five minutes and made the movie able to stand on its own.     All in all, a beautiful, magical, frustrating movie!    In terms of the DVD, the special features are OK. There are some good interviews, but the layout is not very helpful. Nothing is labled or located logically.
6305313687|4.0|This was a very good movie. If you are easily offended I dont recomend it. Basically Edward Norton is a skin head who is sent to prison for stomping a black gang member's head into the curb. While there he gets in with some aryian brotherhood types crosses them, bad things happen. He befriends a black man and changes. After getting out he tries to help his brother who is on the same path as he was. You'll have to see the movie to get the rest of it. I havent seen the amazon version so I dont know if its edited or not.
1594200106|5.0|This book defies being labelled as a thriller, a romance or a mystery.  It is all of these and more.  One of the most beautifully written stories that I have ever read, the book pulls you along effortlessly.  With descriptions that make scenes come alive more vividly than on any movie screen, it is almost impossible to put this book down until reaching the end.  And it was with a deep sigh, that I finished the last sentence and closed the book.  I wanted more.  My solace is that Zafon has written quite a few other books which I am about to embark upon.  If they are anything like Shadow of the Wind, I may hibernate and read all winter.
B0006399FS|3.0|I like rock music, so when I heard U2 called by many \\"The greatest rock band ever,\\" I bought this album. The Edge's guitar was very good throughout most of the album. Combine that with Bono's vocals, and you have a great soft rock cd. <br /> <br />-Vertigo (10/10)-my favorite song on the album, great beat, best rock song here <br />-Miracle Drug (7/10)-great guitar picking <br />-Sometimes you can't make it on your own (5/10)- ok, too mellow for my taste <br />-Love and peace or else (7/10)-cool song, good message <br />-City of Blinding Lights (10/10)-cool song about New York, Bono's falsetto is awesome here <br />-All because of you (8/10)- Very upbeat, great guitar picking here too <br />-A man and a woman (5/10)-beginning is a little weird, but the rest is a great upbeat song <br />-Crumbs from your table (8/10)-my second favorite song, awesome guitar and vocals <br />-One step closer (6/10)-very slow song <br />-Original of the species (8/10)-many layered song, well done <br />-Yahweh (7/10)- good guitar and upbeat feel <br />------OVERALL (7/10) <br /> <br />THE GOOD <br />-------- <br />Bonos voice and the guitar playing by the Edge <br /> <br />THE BAD <br />------- <br />This album (excluding Vertigo) is very slow and mellow. <br /> <br />VERDICT <br />------ <br />The sound for most of the album is VERY soft and mellow, so if you like your rock loud and fast (eg the Hives, Guns N Roses, AC/DC), you may not like this album. Go buy the new Pearl jam cd instead. If, however, you like soft rock, then buy this album.

0316168815|5.0|As an avid reader whose nose is always in a book, it's saying something that \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is the first book that has ever made me weep.  Weep with sorrow for the untimely death of the book's youthful narrator, with sympathy for her grieving family, with shock at the familiarity of emotions and actions after the murder. <br /> <br />Sebold depicts the Salmon (\\"like the fish\\") family intimately and intricately, with nuances that are sure to hit close to home for many.  A father recalling the bottled sailboats he made with his eldest daughter.  A young girl recalling the way her older sister's taunting had prompted her first steps.  A brother building a fort he and his older sister had planned to build together by himself. <br /> <br />In addition, Sebold offers a glimpse into Susie's heaven, a beautiful and poignant world whose 'rules' become clearer to Susie as she watches her family's lives without her.  As time goes on, she also realizes that she is always with them. <br /> <br />\\"The Lovely Bones\\" deals with letting go yet holding on--finding the right balance.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I thought this movie was probably not going to be to my liking but boy was I wrong. My whole family(ages 2 to 63) and I absolutely love this movie. Will Ferrell is hilarious and the movie has a great story to tell. I can't stop watching it now because its that good. It's not at all dumb as others have said. There's excellent scenery, great music, and the whole movie was very well done. It's enjoyable for people of all ages. A very fun Christmas movie. One of the best I've seen in along time. Destined to be a Christmas classic(well at least as far as I'm concerned)! But the only way to know if you will enjoy it is for you to see it for yourself!
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I was really looking forward to seeing 'Shaun of the Dead', and since it never came to any local theaters despite the fact that it was outperforming half the films showing at those places even with a limited release, I got to look forward to seeing it even longer. (um, yay. A fate to which House of Flying Daggers is no doubt consigned)  Fortunately, it proved  to be more than worth the wait, and was definitely  one of the best movies in a fairly ho-hum year.  As far as comedies go, I think this movie's about as good as it gets.  Of course, I'm a big horror fan, and a big zombie fan, in particular, so this is pretty much aimed right at me.  Still, 'Shaun of the Dead' probably has a lot more general appeal than your typical Horror-Comedy, and I think it should appeal to must people who like comedies that, ya know, don't suck.<br /><br />Alright, basic setup.  Shaun is a 29 year old guy, who's kinda aimless and going nowhere, at least partially due to his bestfriend/roomate Ed, who's a fat, immature loser.  So, his girlfriend, Liz, dumps him, and he and Ed get really drunk, and where ever the film was heading before is interrupted, as England is then overrun by zombies.  Unlike the more famous horror-comedy films (Evil Dead II, Re-Animator, Dead-Alive), this film actually takes itself fairly seriously at times. (Particularly towards the end, where the characters are all holed in together, appear to be pretty much doomed, and start fighting one another.)  Some people have gone so far as to say this is more Horror film than Comedy, which is massively overstating it, but it's certainly not purely light-hearted fare either. Lots of people think this is a bad thing, but I certainly don't.  It works very well both when it's trying to be funny and when it's trying to be serious/dramatic/touching, and I always like films that are willing to play with tone.(one of the best aspects of the original Dawn of the Dead, imo)  I also particularly like the  more serious bits, because it makes it abundantly obvious that the makers of the film have a genuine affection for the genre they're parodying.<br /><br />The film has a level a visual flair and an attention to detail which are pretty extraordinary for a comedy, and quite impressive, regardless of genre.  They use lots of great long, steadicam shots and some fun, ultra-kinetic, rapid fire editing. (used to comedic, rather than dramatic effect)  The detail comes in how there's lots going on in the background, and how the film likes to repeat similar scenarios, before and after the zombie attack, and of course, the numerous references to other films.  They're particularly fond of referencing the original Living Dead trilogy, naturally, with a particular penchant for the Evil Dead films as well.  Still, it doesn't rely on Horror films alone, referencing The Deer Hunter and Reservoir Dogs, and British tv shows, and probably lots of other stuff I didn't catch.  I also like how it has the will to be subtle- you probably won't notice the references if you aren't familiar with the original material. (i.e. there aren't any moments in the film where it's abundantly obvious that what someone did/said was a reference so something, but you don't know what it is.  At least there weren't for me)<br /><br />Reviewing comedies is hard.  All I can say is that I though it was funny. Very funny.  It smarter than your average comedy, I suppose, but it isn't afraid of slapstick or lowbrow humor either. Going into specifics would be pretty fruitless, and hurt the film when you actually see it, so I won't bother. You'll just have to trust me on this one.<br /><br />It's also got a surprising amount of gore, which is generally nicely done. There are quite a few nicely done gunshots, and two particularly stunning headshots. Furthermore, this film doesn't ever let us forget that zombies eat flesh, and there's scene of someone being ripped limb from limb which recalls a number of deaths from Dawn and Day of the Dead simultaneously.  The zombies themselves look quite nice, though they are fairly low-key.<br /><br />Yeah, that's about it.  Definitely a great movie, which certainly must be viewed by any zombie fan.ltaneously.

B0001HAISG|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, I thought the effects were too jarring, and I was a little creeped out about Jason Isaacs' Hook, because he was so lusty, seemingly towards everyone, especially Wendy. <br /> <br />So why did I see it again?  And why 5 stars? <br /> <br />It was on tv again, and I've always liked Isaacs.  Before this movie, I'd only seen the animated version, and Peter-as-woman stage movie.  I never knew that Peter Pan was supposed to be about coming-of-age or sexual tensions or whatever.  (I evidently was VERY young when I saw either version.)  This take was deeper, and made me reconfigure my whole belief on Pan, which is why I'd recommend it to adults who haven't seen one in a while.  I'm sure it's okay for kids too...Hook isn't going to seem sexy to a child, but for me...well...
B00005JN0T|3.0|\\"Kill 'em Viki\\", is what I found myself saying during the climax of the movie.  I always have to wonder when I start rooting for the \\"Badguy\\" in any movie.  Right after Viki gives her last memorable speech of how the human race is run by self interest, self involvment and self everything (which is primarily true), they decide to shut her down and kill her because the truth hurts.  My main question in this movie was, who's the good guy and who's the bad guy?  By the end of the movie, I wanted Will Smith's character dead and his little counter part's character to suffer too.  Not that the robots were anything to cheer about either.  Their faces were enough to punch, and their pompous laid back attitude is what's wrong with humanity in the first place.  I was more intrigued with the first stage robots.  They had kind faces and hearts of gold.  A big problem I had with this movie was the miscasting of Will Smiths character and the fact it ripped alot of the premise of the film off \\"Blade Runner\\".  I was impressed with the awesome special effects, it's just a shame the story didn't live up to the visuals.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I have watched a lot of movies in my time but this one truly sucked. It was like watching a cat cough up a fur ball, actually no...I think that would have been more exciting. I couldn't understand why this movie was know as a funny movie. This movie was just plan slow,and so was the acting.  If you want to watch a funny movie watch office space or dodgeball. I wish I could rate this movie even lower than one star but I had to give it one.
B00005B36H|5.0|I also asked my friend to lend me a copy of this cd (as i did with aenima.  And again, i am happy that i did.  This may overall be the best Tool cd (i havent heard much of untertow yet, with the exception of sober).  I really enough just about every song on this album.  To save time, i will review my favorite tracks off this album. <br />It starts of with THE GRUDGE.  This track has a bit of an instrumental intro, but it is amazing none the less.  This may be the best song vocally on this album. <br />Tool's latest effort, may be their greatest effort. <br />Next we have SCHISM.  This may be the most well-known song of the Lateralus cd.  One again, great music with great vocals and intelligence. <br />Next up, PARABOLA.  This song is fast-paced right from the get go.  The song is relativley long, but the vocals aren't too long.  Oh well, long enough to fit the song. <br />TICKS & LEECHES.  Now this song needs more lyrics.  The lyrics that it has are great and this may be the most rock song on the album.  But as i said, the lyrics are too short.  But i love it anyway. <br />Fianlly, LATERALUS.  This is the title track and is quite long.  Much longer then the tracks i have already mentioned.  This also may be my favorite (along with THE GRUDGE).  It has a long instrumental beginning, but when the vocals kick in it gets really great.  Although it is long, i am able to listen the whole way through. <br />
0061015725|3.0|This book is decent. Not really anything wrong with it, but I didn't find it to be all that amazing. I was expecting more from a Crichton book, really. He did an awful lot of exposition about the bots and their manufacturing and programming. An awful lot. I skipped over a great deal of these parts, because it seemed he kept telling me the same thing over and over, and I didn't miss anything about the story or reasonings. The characters...well, I just didn't care. I didn't like any of them. They bored me.  <br /> <br />Worth a read from the library, but there's no way I would ever pay for it.
B00015HVI8|4.0|I found that SG-1 just keeps getting better as it goes along. However in Season 6 we do not see Daniel Jackson and although I think Jonas Quinn is a good character, there did seem to be a void left when Daniel departed.<br />I do like Corin Nemic as Jonas but his character does not have the passion that Daniel did when it came to finding relics, ancient dialects and well just in general.<br />Overall though, the season is great. Some fantastic acting by the whole cast. I think Stargate is unique in the fact that it has a very strong ensemble cast and none are really weaker than the other. <br />I really look forward to getting my Season 7 boxed set for Christmas and really cannot wait for Season 8 to wrap up and come out in the boxed set.<br />Stargate SG-1 lives on!
B00001NFCY|5.0|I surmize that creed was undone by Scott Stapp and his incredibly bombastic and hold nothing back attitude toward his \\"art\\" .Creed was a band that was like a steak covered with a banana split sundae, just too much. Somehow when weathered was released the thing that turned me off the most about creed was the videos they made, youve seen em right, they look like scenes out of Scott's dreams, and he always seems to be in slow motion looking like some kind of greek god, Just too much, too many ideas. Too much arrogance, not enough down to earthness, Still I find Human Clay such an endearing and overpainted masterpiece of post grunge Hardpop rock, that I cannot bring my self to giving it any less than five stars, It spoke to me. Hate creed all you want, But youd be lying to yourself if you after one listen to human clay you couldnt find a permanent place for this album in your collection and in your heart.
0792164903|4.0|I was surprised because I actually liked this movie.  It's kind of dumb in parts but the story is interesting and Johnny Depp is wonderful, as usual.  Tim Burton is a fantastic director who always steps outside of the bounds of normality.  He is visionary and Sleepy Hollow is no exception.  This is a very beautiful movie at times and I highly recommend it to anyone.
0743490304|1.0|Brown has many flaws as an author.  One of the most annoying is his over-simplification of characterization.  We're treated to a bunch of cookie-cutter, politically correct and politically motivated characters less interesting than cardboard cut-outs.<br /><br />  Every minority is intelligent, honest, and likeable.  All women are to be respected and feared, and all but one is young and beautiful.  The Democrat character is soooooo unrealistically honest and decent he won't even \\"campaign negatively\\" by leaking evidence of illegal actions from his opponent.  The Republican character is bigoted, sexist, homophobic, in the pocket of corporations, and is ultimately willing to let his daughter die for \\"the sympathy vote\\".<br /><br />  With such mind-numbingly simple characters, Dan Brown's tale is very predictable.  He's a joke as a political analyst, and it shows with his uninformed and simplistic religious/conservative bashing.<br /><br />  Dan Brown's idea of building suspense is to introduce us to yet more boring one-time characters who don't further the plot, and they neither deepen nor explain the mystery.  They just delay the inevitable.  Brown's \\"surprising\\" plot twists might be surprising if you've never read any book before in your life.<br /><br />  I guess readers overloook many of Brown's flaws because he 1) includes a few \\"scientific facts\\" in the midst of a bunch of junk science, or 2) he is an annoying liberal shill.<br /><br />  Tom Clancy does have conservative political leanings, but at least he paints a more suspensful, realistic tale, and without cramming his view of politics down your throat with childish, cartoonish characters.
B000002UB3|5.0|The Beatles are my all time favorite band, and I consider them the greatest artists of all time. Out of all thier albums, this is my number one. It is classic and at the same time revolutionary, just like the Beatles themselves. The thing that makes this album my favorite out of all of them is the amazing second half, listening to that all the way through will change the way you think about music.  I forget that there is more than one song on that second half and just listen to it as if it were one. Also, Come Together is on this album, one of my all time favorite Beatles tracks.
B000062Y44|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS A GREAT INSPIRATION FOR ANYONE TRYING TO TURN THEIR LIFE AROUND.
B00009RAJJ|4.0|If you like variety, good muscianship, and great lyrics, get this album.  The title of this review is for the fact that half of the songs are junk, the other half is pure inspired rock.  So even with half the songs not good, the double album means you get a lot of good songs.  Stevie's voice is never better, Christine's also.  Whenever I am a little down, the title cut will boost me up with its energy.  Brown Eyes reminds me of a girl I was crazy about that I could never figure out, and after 25 years it brings back those feelings.  Sisters of the Moon builds from a slow dreamy song to a passionate blast.  Middle of the road rock songs like Save Me a Place are good to listen to when you don't want to think much about the music.   <br />All in all this is Mac's second best album, only following Rumours because of the bad songs.  If you do as I did, copy only the good stuff to a cd (or cassette as was available in 1979) then you have a full album of great songs.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie is so funny, I laughed my head off! I would love to see it again. anyone that likes good comedies probably will love this, cause it's good. It has some funny lines like \\"Idiots!\\" and \\"Are you gonna eat your tots?\\" & \\"I like your sleeves\\". Theres just a bunch of funny humor that some people may or may not like. Grab this one at your rental place, it rocks!
B0002858YS|5.0|Here come the Killers.  I haven't found an album I've enjoyed as much as this one since...well almost ever.  <br /> <br />The music is diverse, catchy and memorable.  I find myself singing the song I hear as I get out of the car in the morning all day. <br /> <br />The lyrics are smart and in turns funny or thoughtful.  <br />  <br />There isn't a song on this one that I skip past and a great number that I replay as soon as they end! <br /> <br />Overall, one of my happiest album purchases in recent memory!! <br />
0783110871|3.0|I can't say I was too fussed about watching this movie, but I watched this movie, otherwise I would have watched Tru Calling all night! :) As it's a Christmas movie, I was only ALLOWED to watch it before Christmas. Not after, cos that would be bad, right? I decided to watch it on Christmas Eve Eve, but I'm beginning to wish I'd watched it now, as Christmas Eve is really dragging - I'm still a big kid at heart! (I wanna open presents!)<br /><br />I have to say, after this movie started, I was instantly distracted by Lauren Holly's severe haircut - boy, that did NOT suit her! If I remember correctly, I've only seen her before in Dumb & Dumber, but the haircut was absolutely dreadful! (Apologies to people out there who have this haircut.) Someone who has prominent cheekbones that I would die for, would probably get away with it. She also manages to strip down to her underwear, when she doesn't have much to fill it, and it just a cheap thrill for the guys.<br /><br />I've never seen Goodfella's, so had absolutely no idea who Ray Liotta was, although he reminded me of a more evil-looking Patrick Swayze! That was also very distracting! He did quite a good job, making you constantly wonder whether he was the good guy or the bad guy. He's also a bit OTT in the role - I'm not sure why, he just wasn't convincing.<br /><br />I love Hector Elizondo ever since I saw Pretty Woman, and then afterwards, Runaway Bride. He doesn't appear much in this, and almost comes across as the bad guy at points.<br /><br />Most of the movie isn't worth going into detail about. You mix in every (im)possible event that could happen, and then add the plucky, brave girl (flight attendant, not stewardess!) who thinks she can save the day. Prancing around in your underwear doesn't save the day.<br /><br />What scared me most about this movie was the very obvious references to the 9/11 tragedy - despite it being made 4-5 years before, it seemed almost like a premonition at some points, and scared the bejeezus out of me. I think if this had been out around the same time as 9/11, it would have been either straight-to-DVD, or, like Spiderman, the World Trade Centre digitally removed. (WTC doesn't appear in this - it's what happens that makes me think of 9/11.)<br /><br />What I did like about this movie, was Lauren Holly getting told how to land the plane - or attempt to - and seeing what all the buttons were. I felt like I learned a little bit - although I'll probably forget it all. That was the one bit of the movie I really concentrated on, and it actually interested me.<br /><br />For me, this movie is what Final Destination was like a few years, just before I went on holiday. I won't be getting on a plane anytime soon. It's a stupid movie, but good enough to remove a couple of hours of your life watching it.ared the bejeezus out of me.

B00005JNBQ|4.0|Oh my gosh, this movie is so weird. It floats along, aimless most of the time, yet in some odd way it kept my attention for the 90 minutes it ran. I do like Napoleon Dynamite. He's such a dork-- he's flippin' clueless and, what other reasons do you need, God! That's the way he talks. It's actually pretty funny! <br /> <br />Without John Heder, I don't think this movie could have survived or gained the momentum that it did. He IS Napoleon. Anyone else would have just been way under par. So Napoleon lives with his grandmother, his nerdy skinny brother, and a pet llama named Tina. He meets Pedro, a new kid a school and Deb, a shy girl who \\"left all her crap on [his] porch,\\" an assortment of bracelets and what not. They float along together, as Napoleon battles his Uncle Rico, tries to get dates, and also attmpets to elect Pedro as president of the school.  <br /> <br />Hard to say whether or not you'll like this. My punk rocking sister loved it. My dad enjoys movies overall and called it \\"quirky.\\" Which usually means he liked it. My mom hated it, but she's apt to dislike any comedy unless it has Jim Carrey in it. I liked this one. It's weird, but Napoleon was too interesting for me to turn it off. It was fun being in his world for 90 minutes. Give it a try sometime.
B00006SFLV|5.0|I love this show soooo much! I am currently 15 and as a teenager, we need more shows like this. At first I started watching Degrassi when I was about 12 and I loved that show so much, so I continued to watch it. Then, I noticed that there was going to be a new show airing on my birthday, January 1st. It turned out to be My So-Called Life and I continued to watch it because Claire Danes was on the show and she was truly my idol. I had first seen her in Romeo &amp; Juliet (1996) and I just had a feeling that this show was going to be even better. I fell madly in love with MSCL and I'm 100% sure that you will, too. This show made me realize that I'm not alone when it comes to the pressures of being a teenager.
B00006L83N|5.0|This was my first CD that i purchased by them. I enjoyed it so much. I still continue to listen to it after over a year after buying it. I started to fade away from metal music a bit, but now i'm back into full swing right back into it. I think that iw ill probably buy another one of their cds. I was so impressed by the artwork when i bought it, i couldn't stop looking at the vivid detail! BTW THE ODESSY IS THE BEST SONG!
B000063DFN|5.0|Is Powerslave Maiden's best album? For me, personally, their 5th release is certainly up there with Seventh Son..., The Number of the Beast and Somewhere in Time. Some of my earliest experiences with Maiden songs came from this album. Rime of the Ancient Mariner when I first listened to it was the longest song I had ever heard, Powerslave, the title track, when I first heard it was like nothing I had heard previously, with the brilliant Egyptian feel running through it. As such, this is one of my favourite CDs personally. <br /> <br />It starts off with a bang with the quick opener Aces High, a song about the Second World War. The song is in your face, Bruce Dickinson's vocals soar along in the chorus and the riffwork is excellent. The guitar solo after the first verse is also brilliant and the song captures the World War 2 theme exactly. It's a seamless song, Maiden at their best, and it makes you really anticipate the rest of the album. The opening to the second track, 2 Minutes to Midnight, kicks in, and this is another highlight of the album. It's another song about war and the lyrics are again very good. The guitar solo is excellent as well and the song provides six minutes of pure heavy metal magic. <br /> <br />If there is a weak area of this album, it's the middle area, which does pale in comparison to the opening two tracks and the final two in my opinion. However, that doesn't mean the songs are bad at this point. The instrumental track Losfer Words is one of my favourite instrumentals. It chugs along nicely and later in the song Maiden's guitarists show what they are capable of. Flash of the Blade is another nice track, not one of the highlights of the album but still good, and after it comes the six minute track, The Duellists, which is one of the lesser known songs from this album. Dickinson's vocals are excellent on this one and it has a memorable chorus and instrumental section in the middle with some great guitar work. Then Back in the Village has avery good intro and it continues in the same vein as the previous track. <br /> <br />However, it's the final two tracks that also stand out for me and are two of my favourite Maiden tracks full stop. The instantly memorable, Egyptian sounding riff kicks off Powerslave, and the riff before the chorus also uses the Egyptian sound. In the middle of the song it slows down and this leads into a great guitar solo as it speeds up again, before it returns to the original riff and tune, and the magnificent ending rounds off an excellent Maiden tune, but we don't stop there! We're still yet to hear the 13 minute epic, Rime of the Ancient Mariner, based on the poem by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. This song tells the story of the poem aided by the excellent guitars and despite it being almost 14 minutes in length, it never gets boring. The quiet section in the middle is haunting and plants the image of the poem in your head, and it kicks back into life as Bruce screams \\"then down in falls comes the raiiiiiiiiiiin!\\" which is the cue for the breathtaking solos from the guitars. As the song slows to a halt Powerslave is over. <br /> <br />This may not be my absolute favourite record released by Iron Maiden, as an album I think certainly Seventh Son of a Seventh Son is superior, but some of the individual tracks on here are amazing, especially the opener and closer. This is another five star effort from Maiden from their golden period in the mid-1980s, and you're definitely missing out if you don't own it. <br /> <br />Stand-outs: Aces High, 2 Minutes to Midnight, Rime of the Ancient Mariner <br />
0451191153|5.0|Fountainhead is Ayn Rand's novel introducing the world to her powerful concept of objectivism.  The protagonist is Howard Roark, the ideal objectivist man, who holds himself to standards above those commonly held by society.  He avails himself against medicority in the form of outdated schools, petty peers who get by purely on social skills, and a socialst organization bent on proving that everyone really is equal.      There are three criticisms frequently made against the novel:  1)  The characters are one dimensional, lacking depth.  To this I respond that Rand writes in the Romantic tradition, preferring extreme characters (whom we should strive to become) to clearly dilenate the battle between good and evil, rather than more complicated or in depth characters.  2)  The positions she takes are too extreme and unrealistic.  For this, I suggest looking at the timeframe.  It was the 1940s, and the US was just waking up to the horrors of communism.  Coming out of the 1930s, the US could have taken a dramatically more socialist turn.  As a wake-up call, this book needed to be stark.  3)  The rape scene is hardly becoming of an \\"Ideal\\" man.  I have no response to this criticism, as it is likely true.    Despite being perhaps 400 pages too long, and rather one dimensional, this still ranks as one of the most influential works of our century.  Many silicon valley execs praise the self-deterministic beliefs, and even our Fed Chairman is an admirer (though he's backed off many of his more extreme beliefs).  If you agree with the precepts, consider it fuel for your fire.  If you consider Rand a crackpot cult leader, read it to better understand your enemy.

B0002Y69NG|5.0|I agree with the guy below me, do we really need to write another review. It's a good flick and the only DVDs in this collection that rule are M1-M3 and the Animatrix DVDs; the others are a waste of time, space and energy. What they should have done is actually include the Movies that were the origin of the Matrix, like the Ghost in the Shell manga, and some others I'd remember if I didn't do those all damn drugs in my youth.
B000001ZSF|5.0|Jarre was my introduction to electronic music and I can be characterized as one of his hardcore fans. I have almost all albums  and have heard them hundreds of times, studying the composition techniques, the sound selections, the use of samples etc etc. <br /> <br />After all these years, Chronologie stands out from everything else as his top creation. This album goes from classical orchestrations to typical jarre style as per the old albums, and even to pop and dance music experiments. It is an amazing masterpiece and a cornerstone in electronic music.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Okay, this is what I'd be singing to any movie I watched AFTER watching Kill Bill. Taratino is a master storyteller, just like M. Night Shalahlie -something. Kill Bill closely resembles Pulp, in its crypted storyline, and you won't really get most of it, after watching the first volume. So do yourself and favour and rent or buy the second volume along with the first. This ain't for kiddies and chances are some of the bloody scenes might get you shocked or grossed out. But i like that :- When directors say \\"screw you\\" to the censors and create what people's imagination are made of - reality. <br />For a movie that you WILL watch over and over again, this is where you stop.
B000002L9J|5.0|One of the most influential of the Smiths albums (I prefer Meat is Murder myself). I find 'The Boy with a Thorn in His Side' particularly profound (almost an anthem of modern times). 'Bigmouth Strikes Again' is one of the most witty songs ever written (at his best moments Morrissey evokes the spirit of his idol Oscar Wilde - and sometimes Jean Genet). Another favorite track is 'There is a light and it never goes out' - great fun - and unbelievable music. Morrissey is a modern bard of the discontent we all feel and this is one of his finest moments!
B00005JKNC|5.0|This film is a parabole of the Bill of Rights and the First Amendment of the US Constitution. As such it is a masterpiece. We flash back to the McCarthy era when some politicians were obssessed and pbnubilated by a communist plot against America that never existed but in their warped minds. One film author is named by someone as a communist and he has to clear himself by naming some more people. He knows it is wrong by principle. He knows the names are those of people who have nothing to do with the accusation and who were at the most, like him maybe naive and certainly moved by the show of misery, suffering and war in the world. They were humane and nothing else and they used their plain constitutional rights to do something about it. The trick of this film is to make that person have an accident at the time of the accusation, lose his memory and assume the identity of a real war hero who was lost in action. The people of the little town of Lawson want him to assume that identity to give them their dream back, the dream of the America that has fought for the freedom of the human race in the world for three odd centuries. He is led into this situation by his loss of memory, though he recovers it at the very moment when the FBI and others catch up on him. As his real self he has no courage and is ready to play the game of the politicians to get his life back. As his assumed self he should fight for the Bill of Rights and the First Amendment even if he has to go to jail for it. The dense ending of the film is romantic about this situation and makes him make the good ethical choice, but that turns him into an untouchable hero. The film forgets that thousand of people suffered because of this short period of anticommunist bigotry in the head of a fundamentalist senator. Yet the film goes farther with a punchline at the very end, after he has recovered his job at the studio and his life, or nearly so. He realizes that filmmakers and film artists have another way of yielding : to produce some pitiful and pathetic stuff that loses human depth and replaces it with melodramatic images, and images are nothing but virtual emotions, no real deep-felt feelings and sentiments. You can imagine the return of the hero back to Lawson. If you can't do watch the film. Maybe you will come to the idea that our world would be a lot better if the powerful - and power is transient - stopped crucifying innocent victims. But fighting against victimization is a good good good thing to do : it provides you with a clear and shiny conscience.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUing : to produce some pitiful and pathetic stuff that loses human depth and replaces it with melodramatic images, and images are nothing but virtual emotions, no real deep-felt feelings and sentiments.

B000063DHL|5.0|iron maiden are one of the greatest metal bands ever. this cd proves it, tho i think they could have relied a little less on the synths. caught somewhere in time is one of my fav maiden songs, along with wasted years. the other ones dont quite live up to it, but theyre all good. i dont really think bruce gives his best vocal performance on this album, that would go to Powerslave. it feels like he changes notes a little too much, especially when he hits the high notes. i think he does best when he does more of a growl, like in 2 minutes to midnight, but whatever. still a great album, if your a maiden fan pick this up.
B0002F6BRE|1.0|I rented this DVD after hearing so many great things about it. What did I learn? That there are a lot of people out there, that can't tell the difference between DUMB and FUNNY. THIS MOVIE WAS PURE DUMB!!! I did not laugh once, in fact, I had to STOP THE MADNESS and just turn the movie off near the end. TAKE MY ADVICE, if you are looking for a funny Christmas movie, get as far away from this as you can and go rent A CHRISTMAS STORY, Now that was a funny movie.
B000063DI9|2.0|First of all, i edited this review and wanted to give it three stars but cant change the rating i originaly gave it but what can you do. i own 6 maiden albums: Number of the Beast, Piece of Mind, Powerslave, Somewhere In Time, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, and Dance of Death. this is easily my least favorite. i dont really get this album. its clever, a good concept album, but i just cant get into any of the songs except Can I Play With Madness, The Evil That Men Do (An excellent song, one of my favs by maiden, the only thing giving this album three stars) and sometimes Infinite Dreams. this is just too eerie and weird for me and the sound effects and synths really get overdone. Somewhere In Time did this well, by blending the guitars and vocals into the synths, but this album is just weird. i like maiden not only for the metal anthems like hallowed be thy name and the trooper, but also for the catchy stuff, like wasted years and the prisoner. i find neither of them on this album, so i give it a disappointing two stars.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|I believe that in this day and age, the term \\"genius\\" is being used far too loosely.  Since when did this apply to a would-be-McDonalds worker, whose greatest artistic acheivement is breaking the record for the thickest makeup ever worn, and the baggiest clothing?  I am appauled.  I haven't even touched on the \\"music\\" yet. <br /> <br />The \\"music\\"?  Well, if you believe that many painful minutes of jangly acoustic guitars, combined with simple rhyme patterns, combined with bitter lyrics about how \\"I've been mistreated by boys\\" is genius, well than maybe YOU need to take a look in the mirror, and ask yourself... <br /> <br />WHY?  Is it because I\\"M even dumber than my idol? <br /> <br />\\"Rock on!\\"  \\"DDDUUUUHHHH!\\"
B000002H97|5.0|i love thrash as much as the next guy, some of my favorite bands are slayer, megadeth, old metallica, etc. but, i enjoy this album just as much, and im not going to put it down bc metallica went commercial, its still a great album. people give this album 1 star because they say metallica went commercial, so they give it low ratings by metallica standards. what they should be doing is saying its low by metalica standards, but giving it a reasonable review based on the quality of the album, which is easily worth 5 stars. in my opinion this cd is a breath of fresh air, i can listen to metallica without sitting thru 8 minute songs every day. sometimes im in different moods and want a different side of metallica depending on my mood. this album is great, dont let anybody tell you different without judging urself
B0006A9FMI|1.0|All in this movie is great, the animation, the music and the storyline.  But Dreamworks do a really cheap job on their anime release, NO ENGLISH SOUNDTRACK, only japaness language and some subtitle language.  I just recommend that YOU DON'T BUY this and wait for a better release.
B00005QCVY|5.0|I watched this show some year back and it brought me to tears, not of sorrow but of joy.  Joy that I am reminded that how fortunate I am to love and be loved.  It is a true reflection of how one is important to those around you and to treasure them.  The saying of 'what goes around, come around' is befitting of this show.  I am from Singapore and there is no snow, with sunshine year round, but after watching the show, it also brought to me the spirit of Christmas and with it, the warmth.  I recommend this show to anyone who needs a 'boost' in life who feels down and that the whole world is against him.
B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin turned this album into a epic that has and will always stand the test of time. Every single song on this album is definitly one of true meaning to Led Zeppelin \\"heavy and very musical\\". No collection is complete without this album...period.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Both Cruise and Foxx shine in their respective roles as the cold, cultured, refined hitman and the workaday cabbie holding out for the American dream who is taken hostage one evening.  Beyond that, I found little in this film that stands outside the average action film in terms of execution or how the story is told.  While the premise is unique, here is why I didn't like the film:    1. Beyond the premise, I could guess what was going to happen next, including who some of the victims were going to be.  2. It was never clearly explained WHY Cruise wanted to keep Foxx around, rather than cutting him loose and doing the job alone, especially once things didn't go as planned.  3. There were too many coincidences, making too many things convenient.    It is not as if I expected a masterpiece, but I was surprised, based upon the amount of acclaim that was given this film, to find so many problems with the script.  One thing I did like about the film, however, were the messages it tried to send (mainly through Cruise's character) about human interaction and social responsibility in an increasingly urban, populous environment.  The film should have developed this idea more and spent less time in cliches.
B000002UAR|5.0|The Beatles made a collection of songs on this album that they would never produce on tour. This album shows that the Beatles <br />were moving into a new direction, a direction that would move them into a category of there own where they will be remembered as the greatest band in rock n roll history...immortals to say the least. <br />
B000000W5L|5.0|If you like a deep groove rock jam and have the blues in your heart... this IS the GREATEST RECORD EVER!  Features some of Jagger's best vocals, Mick Taylor and Keith riffing guitar blues, bouncy rhythms and piano, it's all there in PEAK PERFORMANCES by all players (including the excellent cast of sidemen.) Incredibly soulful. I want to be buried with this one.<br /><br />added note: I've recently listened to a few covers of songs off \\"Exile\\"  performed in various genres (blues, bossanova, what have you) and I'm struck at how well the SONGS hold up under re-imagined and/or faithful interpretations.  Speaks to the excellence of the Stones' original songcraft.  EXCELLENT ALBUM. Buy it. All of it.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|It's never easy to see Matt Damon as the action hero, but like his previous turn as Jason Bourne Damon really shines in the role.  While these stories are not faithful adaptations of Robert Ludlum's novels they do capture the essence of the novels - the idea of this former CIA mercenary who only wants to live a normal life, but can't seem to escape the clutches of a government that wants to kill him, or use him if they can.  What the creators of these films do is re-imagine the stories in modern times using modern-age enemies to face Bourne.  Matt Damon has really wrapped himself around the essence of the character and at times has some real moments of drama that you don't normally see in action movies of this type.  Damon is also surrounded by a great supporting cast.  Brian Cox and Julia Stiles are back and do a fantastic job.  This time around we also have Joan Allen as an embattled CIA operative who only wants to do the right thing while being thwarted at every turn by rogue agents.  Karl Urban is great as Jason Bourne's nemesis and a worthy adversary as Bourne's Russian counterpart.  I was riveted from the first minute and anyone who enjoys well-written and well-acted action films will be, as well.
B0006419J6|4.0|Decent, not ground-breaking but highly enjoyable and necessary for today's scientists and their robotic craze.
B00005JN0T|4.0|First, if you're looking for a faithful adaptation of Isaac Asimov's story, then you will be very disappointed.  Calling this movie \\"inspired by\\" Asimov's story is being nice. So avoid it if you're one of those people who must see a word-for-word adaptation to enjoy the movie.  That being sad, on its own merits this is a very good movie and it's not just some summer movie blockbuster.  Will Smith is, as usual, very good.  The robot special effects are out of sight.  The action is non stop.  And the story they cobble together from Asimov's ideas is actually quite good.  There were moments in this movie that were quite touching and very dramatic.  Take this movie on its own merits and you will enjoy it.
0802130208|3.0|This book met but did not exceed, my expectations.  As in other Pulitzer prize winners, I was looking for a similar standard in this book, and it came up short of the hype that surrounded it when it was discovered, published, and circulated years ago.    The writing was good - not great - which you would expect from a college professor.  The characters were well-developed but soon, you could anticipate their conversations and reactions to virtually every encounter.  This familiarity can sometimes be a positive, but here, it demonstrated simple, under-developed people and their accents (well crafted, by the way)masked the lack of depth to the people themselves.      There were numerous storylines that meandered, and although the end attempted to tie everything up, instead it seemed as if the writer (who later committed suicide) needed to hurry up and finish a book that was going nowhere.    It had its moments and was at times, very perspicuous in looking into the minds of people we have only heard about.  I guess these brief glimpses of potential and wit were the reasons it barely made the cut for the Pulitzer.  But someone much smarter than me may one day explain how 'Confederacy' can win the Pulitzer, and not 'A Prayer for Owen Meany' by John Irving.
B00066N8JS|5.0|I always thought that the cd was like a wall of sound, but it doesn't compare to the sacd surround mix.  The sound quality really doesn't matter with this sacd since it's mainly synthesizers and screaming, with an odd whisper.  It's all about the 5.1 sound attacking your senses and painting Reznor's haunting picture.  I can actually understand some of the lyrics that I couldn't on the cd and it's a pretty miserable album.  But hey, sometimes I'm just not in the mood for Abba.  Ha ha ha!
B0006AZMFM|4.0|Delta's extremely successful debut 'Innocent Eyes' was always going to be a hard act to follow. Critically acclaimed, with her album going 12 times platinum, this young songstress amazed everyone with her amazing vocal ability, fresh new sound, and very obvious talent for the piano. However, it is safe to say that with 'Mistaken Identity', Delta more than delivers.  While it is hard to say whether she outdoes her original album, one thing is sure - the delta we know and love is very much still here. So, saying that, if you didnt enjoy the first album, I wouldn't reccommend this album, as stylistically it is similar.  But for me, who really got a lot out of the first album, mistaken identity has everythign we loved about delta. This album is a mixture of inspirational songs and love ballads. <br /> <br />Now let's have a look at the album track by track; <br />1) Out of the Blue - although there was a bit of public debate over whether this song really matched up to her old standards, I maintain that this is a great song.  Musically, it is quite unconvential for delta, but all the same, it really delivers as a truly uplifting love song.  As the first single, it is a great opening to the album, which showcases her extraordinary vocal ability. 9/10 <br />2) Analyst - On a first listen of the album, i have to say this track really stood out.  With it's captivating piano melodic line at the beginning, and it's intriguing lyrics, I think this is one of the songs that will end up being released as a single. <br />8/10 <br />3) Mistaken Identity - Musically, this song is very typical Delta.  However, I feel that the bold statement she makes with her lyrics, which are cleverly rhymed and crafted, really lift this song.  It's this raw attitude which I found refreshing after the first sugar-coated (as fantastic as it was) album.   <br />8/10 <br />4) Extraordinary Day - After a profound introduction, I found that that the verse fails to really lift off.  The bridge and the chorus are more interesting, and while the lyrics are very emotional, and as pleasant as this song is, I am never really swept of my feet. that having been said, it is a truly delta song. 6.5/10 <br />5) A little too late - Despite its conventional sound, I found this is a great easy listening song. It has a really light-hearted feel, which is really pushed along by the lyrics.  While it isn't the most amazing of tracks, its feel good message gets you in the end. 7.5 / 10 <br />6)Be Strong - One of the best on the album, this track really stands out, due to its deep inspirational message and simple instrumental accommpaniment, which gives delta a great chance to shine. This track is extremely uplifting, and one can see the amazing maturity in her, both muscially and vocally. 10/ 10 <br />7)Electric Storm -slightly more unconventional, this is an interesting track, which captures you from the beginning,with the intricate piano part.  Her powerful voice is displayed, and while the verse can seem a little dull, the chorus quickly picks up the pace making this song into a winner. 8/10  <br />8) Almost here - Among the weakest on the album, this track fails to take off.  It starts nicely with the male voice, but both musically and lyrically the track doesnt seem to develop or go anywhere. That having been said, i thought it was refreshihng to see her try and do a duet.  However, i don't feel it was nearly as good as it could have been. 6/10 <br />9) Miscommunication - Again, this song fails to convince me.  Its lyrics are noticeably weaker from all the other tracks, and musically, it is quite bland, excepting the chorus which is alright. 6.5/10   <br />10) Santuary - On a first listen, the unsual musical characterstics made this sound more unconventional than her other songs. Quite ordinary at the beginning, the song develops nicely, and delta's vocal talents really push this song along, making it one of the better songs on the album. 8/10 <br />11)Last Night on Earth - thecontrast used in this song makes ir stand out.  With the beautiful and textured piano part at the beginning, which is later repeated, the following more passionate part of the song has a lot more meaning.  Her musical craftmanship is in full view here, which really sets this track away from her other, more conventional sounding ones. 10/10 <br />12) Fragile- listening to this track a second time, I have to say I got more out of it.  The fact that, muscially, this song stays the same is a credit to Delta's fantastic vocal talent, which is left to drive the song.  Her voice portrays a true sense of emotion, and you feel as if you are going on the journey with her. 8.5/10 <br />13) Disorientated - Like 'extraordinary day', I felt this song never really took off the way it should have.  While it has a fun beat and unconvential musical techniques, and delta tries somehting new by speaking in her song,it is not one of those songs you can imagine singing along to.  Probably because it fails to grab you, making it hard to relate to. 6.5/10 <br />14) You are My Rock - Stand out track.  With its beautiful piano part, and simplistic melody, this song captured me from the first listen.  Another reason why this song is my fave, is the way it develops so nicely - and goes from a soft ballad, to a truly powerful song. Truly inspirational. 10/10 <br /> <br />Summary: All in all, despite its ups and (proportionally small) downs, I do feel this is a must havbe album.  Even though there are some weaker tracks, I feel these are only weak by comparison.  It picks up from where the last album left off, but what gives this album more depth is Delta's maturity - conveyed through her intricate composition, and meaningful lyrics.  But most of all, her magical voice lifts every track to new heights. A must have!
B00030590I|5.0|This review is based on the Chinese version DVD, with English subtitles. <br /> <br />This is a great movie based on a true event, one of the most famous assassination attempts on Qin Shihuangdi (pronounced \\"chin shr-hwang-dee\\"), the first emperor of China. When the story starts, a warrior referred to as Nameless is being rewarded for killing three of the most wanted assassins. What they don't tell you in the movie is that Qin Shihuangdi was afraid of death, and he hired alchemists to create the Elixir of Life so he can live forever. So as his first reward, he gets to drink within 20 paces of Qin Shihuangdi (normally the people are only allowed within 100 paces of him.) The first half of the story is Nameless telling Qin Shihuangdi his story of how he killed the three assassins, Sky, Broken Sword, and Flying Sword. After he tells his story, the emperor tells his side of the story, where he throws an interesting twist into it. <br /> <br />According to my East Asian History teacher, this film is historically accurate. The film portrays the ancient Chinese ideals of Confucianism, Legalism, and qi (pronounced \\"chee\\") energy, among others. (Note: yes, they are supposed to look like they are flying, that is supposed to represent qi energy.) <br /> <br />The plot of the film is great, and I was kept in suspense throughout the two stories, and afterwards. The special effects are nothing to write home about (again, the movie is trying to be realistic), but they add great effect to the movie. I can't speak for the voice acting, as I watched it in Mandarin Chinese (and it's pretty hard to express emotion in Mandarin Chinese, what with the 5 tones and all.) Highly recommended.
0767834739|5.0|I recieved this 2 disc set(import from the US) on 22nd and just finished viewing it and heres my review. Please excuse me as my eng isnt that good lol.. <br /> <br />Appearance: Unlike the 1st one it has a colorless \\"wrap\\" on the outside the case. The \\"wrap\\" has digitally printed Alice's whole image as well as all the words on the back. looks very attractive to say the least. Other than 2 discs, inside the cover also is the advertisement paper of the up-coming RE4 game with free T-shirt given if purchased on their site.  <br /> <br />Disc1: <br /> <br />Commentary no.1 by director Alexander Witt, producer Jeremy Bolt, and executive producer Robert Kulzer <br /> <br />**I like this the best. Detailed comment on how they did a particular scene. Witt shows his humbleness and let Bolt and Kulzer do most of the talk. The favourite stuff is Kulzer described how they convinced Capcom's headquarter to let them make RE a movie. They also hinted RE3 is coming soon at the end. I like Bolt's one the best lol. I gave it an 10/10 <br /> <br />Commentary no.2 by Milla Jovovich, Oded Fehr, and Sienna Guillory <br /> <br />**Like the commentary on the 1st movie dvd, this is probably the most hilarious commantary in the history of dvd u will ever hear. Milla and Oded kept joking around so u will probably cant stop laugh til the end,whereas Sienna does her one separately(she talks ridiculously fast btw) which I'm a little disappointed by it. I gave it an 8/10 <br /> <br />Commentary no.3 by writer/producer Paul W.S. Anderson and producer Jeremy Bolt <br /> <br />**This is also a very good one cuse it's done by the director of the lst movie. Paul explains how he created the storyline and why they changed them later on. They also mention Mortal Combat which they did almost 10 yrs ago. I like Bolt steps aside and let Paul does most of the talk as he already talked a lot on the other commentary lol. All in all very very enjoyable to listen to. I gave it an 9/10 <br /> <br />Widescreen anamorphic and full-screen formats <br /> <br />**10/10 all the way. All dvds should include this option all the way.  <br /> <br />Disc2: <br /> <br />20 deleted scenes  <br /> <br />**most of them are not very long but still good <br /> <br />Cast outtakes  <br /> <br />**some mistakes they made in the movie lol <br /> <br />Game Over: Resident Evil Reanimated  <br /> <br />A six-part making-of  <br /> <br />**interview on most of the crews like Milla,Sienna,Oded,Epps,etc..this 6 foot 7 guy named Matt Taylor whos huge but very friendly. Director/producer interview/comment/making of <br /> <br />Corporate Malfeasance: Featurette on the real-world similarities to the Umbrella Corporation  <br /> <br />**a short one on their comments on real world is like Umbrella as to Microsoft mix with US army. <br /> <br />Game Babes: Featurette on the emergence of female action stars in film  <br /> <br />**this is not a game-related feature. It's on their impression on the female lead on this and some of the newer movies. Females are catching up! <br /> <br />Symphony of Evil: Featurette on the special effects used in the film  <br /> <br />**forgot this one <br /> <br />Poster Gallery: A collection of winning submissions created by the finalists of the online poster design contest <br /> <br />**this is only 5 posters to view. Geez not 2 good. <br /> <br />Trailers: <br /> <br />RE:A teaser <br />RE:A trailer <br />RE1 trailer <br />Forgotten tailer(dvd) <br />list goes on.... <br /> <br />Overall a very good set to put in your collection. It's not as jumble as LOTR/Alien dvd alike. But with 3 very interesting commentaries;cristal sharp images and sound;2 hrs of additional 2nd disc making of info. You cant go wrong. Pick it up it definitely worth it!  <br /> <br />Final score: 9/10 <br />
0393057658|5.0|As the Boston Red Sox fan, I found this book to be utterly interesting. The book tells the story of how the money poor Oakland A's managed to fielded a winning team year after year on a budget which is only the third of the many of their rivals. Oakland's General Manager, Billy Beane have developed a new system of accessing talents and getting them cheap. In essence, it all about statistics, theories and possibilities that defied the traditional way for accessing baseball talent.<br /><br />Of course, as a Red Sox fan, I found this book to be a great interest because the Boston General Manager, Theo Epstein, is the great believer and follower of Billy Beane School of Thought on accessing talents. But unlike Beane, Epstein can applied this concept with a big checkbook and the result I believed was the glorious Red Sox victory of 2004.<br /><br />I think after reading the book, I believed someone like Epstein can applied the lessons of Beane and make it work more effectively with a big bankroll. Beane on the other hand, have to let go of players he developed as their demand for a larger paychecks continued. Thus lies Beane's great trap in life. He can maintained a winning team but probably never get to the next level because he can't hold on to what he have developed. The next level is, of course the World Series Championship.<br /><br />A great book for any Red Sox fans out there. It may give us a clue on what Epstein is thinking about when he is giving out contracts, or rejecting a player or getting new player. If not a Red Sox fan, the book is still highly educational in the revolutionary way baseball is changing in front of us.
B0002XDODU|5.0|Reise Reise is just another reason to listen to the german metal kings Ramstein. Amerika is one of there best songs yet. they whole cd is very heavy. If you like ramstien I suggest listing to Dimmu Borgir or Mayhem

Her Michael Deliveres his Classics through from the time of The Jackson 5 at Motown through to when he broke history with a unpresentated 8 grammy awards and sold 30million copies of thriller wow. This Cd Box Set is full of classics and is definetly worth the price. I LOVE MJ
B0001UL7RY|5.0|actually, it's a 4.5 stars, but whatever. i have not been a great fan of avril lavigne; i personally dont like her, i dont like her attitude and everythin, but i must say that Under My Skin kicks aZz! seriously, i wouldnt say she is my favourite artist, although i like her music, but all her songs on this album just rocks. it was WAY better than her 1st album. there are ones that have a lot of depth and meaning, like My Happy Ending, Nobody's Home, Forgotten and Together...those seem to be my fav ones, but all the rest are good too. Take Me Away and Freak Out also have great beats and tunes. well overall, u could just listen to this album over and over and surely it wont bore u (maybe??) <br />Hmm lol anyway. u dont have to be an avril fan..well at least im not, but i recommend this cd.
B000006TRV|5.0|I personally believe that this is Pink Floyd's best work.  The story of a disillusioned rock star's creation of a psychological wall holds this album together nicely.  Roger Water's personal connections with the songs heightens the drama and power.  I think that a message about fame could be pieced together out of the songs, but I recommend just enjoying the story and wonderful theatrical quality of this piece of art.  Tracks I really enjoyed include In the Flesh?, Young Lust, Hey You, Nobody Home, Run Like Hell, and The Trial.  The only set back to The Wall is that it is mostly written and sung by Waters.  While he is amazingly talented, the rest of the band might have had some great ideas to add.  I still loved it though.  Long live Pink Floyd!
0792841344|5.0|great great movie.  The atmosphere... The enigma that is The tall man... The musical score.... It cant get any better.  Watch the movie
B000002WYT|2.0|Now, don't get me wrong; I actually enjoy Pop/Rock Adult Contemporary; just as long as it's from a consistently good band. Bands like The Spin Doctors, Blues Traveler, and Hootie & the Blowfish have all made at least one consistently good album. The Spin Doctors had 'You've Got to Believe in Something', Blues Traveler had 'Four', and Hootie had 'Cracked Rear View'. The Dave Matthews Band is so hit-and-miss that it truly is of those bands that has only released a few good singles. 'Under the Table' only had two good songs (\\"What You Say\\" and \\"Ants Marching\\"), and this album follows suit (\\"Crash\\" and \\"Too Much\\"). I suppose my main beef with The Dave Matthews band is the lack of hooks in their songs. Call that superficial if you want, but a certain amount of catchiness does make or break a band's songs. All in all, The Dave Matthews Band (and the man himself) are, as others have pointed out, utterly bland, even for Adult Contemporary Rock. My suggestion is to get the four songs I mentioned above from a friend, and then to go down to your nearest record emporium and buy some music from the other bands I mentioned above. While you're at it, get some tunes from Sting and The Police. See? There are so many better alternatives to the album filler of Dave Matthews.
B00005JN2Z|3.0|I'll make this brief. Plot is promising but film had a bit of dragging moments enough to put you to sleep just to be waken up again at the end because it suddenly becomes a fast paced thriller. Bonus disc has not much to offer either that would be interesting enough to see. This is just my opinion thou and I dont represent the view of the general public.
0618526412|1.0|A boring book about lonely people and the things lonely people do (nothing). The photo on the cover of the book is perfect, and sums up the feeling through the entire book.
B000007O9L|5.0|One of the very best live offerings from the Stones, \\"Stripped\\" is culled from club dates in Amsterdam and Paris, as well as rehearsals in Tokyo and Lisbon.  The sound is excellent, and much more intimate than on your average live album.    The Rolling Stones do an excellent rendition of Bob Dylan's \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\" with some powerful drumming from Charlie Watts, and a great take on Buddy Holly's \\"Not Fade Away\\", but it's really impossible to talk about highlights here...the entire CD is filled with some of the best performances the Stones have ever released.  They also perform a wonderful live version of the soulful, gospel-like \\"Shine A Light\\", and other rarely-played songs like \\"The Spider And The Fly\\", \\"I'm Free\\" and Robert Johnson's \\"Love In Vain\\".  Also, this rendition of \\"Wild Horses\\" has to be the definitive take on that song, and the same can be said for the superb \\"Dead Flowers\\" (great solo by Ronnie Wood), and the lean, bluesy \\"Sweet Virginia\\".    Many arrangements are primarily or solely acoustic, and Mick Jagger plays the harp on several songs, adding to the intimate atmosphere, as well as helping to make \\"Stripped\\" such a superb, soulful live album, a real gem, and an excellent purchase even for casual Stones fans.  Highly recommended. I just don't understand why this album isn't more highly regarded.
B0002Z9HT8|3.0|I was at Live Aid in Philadelphia.  The DVDs bring back great memories.  It is a real snapshot of the 1980s b/c virtually anyone in pop music was present that day.  The portions from London are quite good and some of the performances by Queen, U2 and the Who are among the best for these performers, especially considering the set limits etc. for the day of this show.  The Philadelphia line-up seems very dated, while the London portion seems to stand the test of time.  The video quality is very poor.  No attempts to clean up the quality of the footage has been attempted -- it is poor quality VHS at best.  The sound quality is fair -- they tried to upgrade the tracks to 5.1, but the reality is that the rear channels are merely muffled audience sounds.<br /><br />The real disappointment though was the song selection itself.  I clearly recall Neil Young doing 3-4 songs, plus a song with Crosby, Stills and Nash, but they have him playing two songs, one of which is a forgettable country song.  Santana is nowhere to be found, and as others have mentioned, so is Led Zeppelin.  These were the most memorable portions of the Philly show, but instead the DVD has long sets from REO Speedwagon, the Cars and Simple Minds.  The worst parts of all were the evening portions of the Philly show.  Patti Labelle looks like a caricature of herself and the portions with Tina Turner and Mick Jacker are contrived at best.<br /><br />The price is cheap and the portions featuring Queen and U2 make the whole package worthwhile, but if you're expecting to actually be able to watch this thing from beginning to end -- forget it.
0060512806|3.0|Waterhouse, Shaftoe & Comstock are all here in the 20th century. <br /> <br />Shaftoe sections are exciting, Waterhouse fairly painful and long long long. <br /> <br />Good for long cruises. <br />
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Yeah the title says it, but just like everyone else alive who isnt worried about following the \\"hype\\" wagon, I love this cd. I first bought this cd along with Mirah's Come on Miricle. at first I couldnt really see what all the hoopla was about and I listened to Mirah quite a bit more. since then I can't remember the last time I've put Come on miricle into my CD player and I cant remember the last time Funeral has left it. The cd has something for everyone and I mean that. Dance pop, funeral durges, folky numbers, and amazing lyrics. I understand that the whole world already knows how great this cd is but I figured Id just tell them agian. Tied with Blueberry Boat for CD of 2004.       * edit, this cd really dies on you.

The lead character is a psychologist but in many ways seems more \\"real\\" than Mr. Kellerman's other protagonists. A QUICK READ, ENJOYABLE THRILLER.
B000007T2Z|5.0|I promised my self I would not hand out 5 star reviews just like it was nothing. I told myself, you can not just give a 5 star review because you liked it once or twice and when it was over forgot about it. but the thing is, Im realizing how amazing some of the cd's Ive heard really are. Godspeed you Black Emperor did something surely amazing here. My first reaction was God that was slow and borring, my second reaction was well this is actually pretty good when you get past all that borring garbage, third reaction was wow that borring garbage really adds to the atmosphere of the whole thing, and fourth reaction was dammit why cant other bands be like this. What I'm trying to say is if I had given this CD a review when I first bought it, you would see 2 stars, maybe three just cause I dont like to belittle something original-ish but I let it grow on me and now I love F#a#oo like a son or something like that

0192833669|5.0|The original version of Frankenstein (or, The Modern Prometheus) was published anonymously in 1818.  However, the version of Frankenstein that most people have read is the 1831 edition, which has significant changes from the original 1818 text.  This book gives the readers a chance to experience the original text, which is less refined and a bit darker then the revised text.  It also provides a wonderful introduction and notes discussing Mary Shelley's life, the context in which this story was written, and the differences between the original text and the 1831 edition.  These notes and introduction are by Marilyn Butler, who was a Professor of English Literature at Cambridge.<br /><br />The story is well known, although certainly the book is nothing like most of the movies that use its name.  While clearly one can find many issues from Mary Shelley's life and times that are addressed in this book, what makes it stand the test of time is how it can be made to relate to modern day issues as well.  One theme, science creates a \\"monster\\" which it cannot control and which ultimately destroys the lives of those that created it, can be found today in areas such as genetics, nuclear physics, etc., and will undoubtedly be with us in the future as well.  Other themes from the story carry forward from 1818 to today as well, which undoubtedly why this story is a classic and will always endure.

From his gay 32 year old brother to La Fawnduh, this movie will have you laughing at every sentence that comes out of Napoleons mouth. <br />For example: \\"don- hey napoleon, what did you do last summer? <br />napoleon- I told you, i spent it with my uncle in alaska hunting wolverines! <br />don- did you kill any? <br />napoleon- yes like fifty of them, they kept trying to attack my cousin what the heck would you do in a situation like that? <br />don- what kind of gun did you use? <br />napoleon- a frickin twelve-guage what do you think!? GOSH!\\" <br /> <br />I really reccomend this movie. It is simple, subtle, and clean. Heck yes its werid, but it gets to you and FORCES you to like it. It would make a great christmas gift. Thanks for reading.
B0006419J6|4.0|I normally don't like movies of this type but I was drawn to this one, I guess because the robots had an almost human quailty to them which I really enjoyed.  For a movie of this genure, it was quite good.  The special effects were good, too.
B0002IVN9W|3.0|for some reasons, this album reminds me a lot for those sounds you hear in church, which pretty much they all tend to repetitive and absolutely lacking personal emotion and intention the whole way. Not my cake but could work for some others. I sold it back in half price right the next day.
0393307050|5.0|I saw the movie and loved it. Then purchased \\"Master and Commander\\" and settled in for a nice read. I had heard of the \\"Sea of Words\\" book and seen it in the stores but was resistant to purchasing anything unecessary. In this case it was a mistake.    After about 100 pages, I stopped reading the book until I actually had the Sea of Words in hand (Christmas). I realized that skipping over terms and phrases which I didn't completely understand was becoming too frustrating; one of the joys of reading the book is the 'forgotten' words and history.    I think its safe to assume that anyone even considering the book will probably purchase it regardless of any review; my only recommendation is that if you have the money, just go ahead and get the \\"Sea of Words\\" book at the same time; that way its there for reference right from the start.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|I had heard a lot about this movie (mainly that it was amazing, brilliant, and the bestest best film ever in the whole world... ever), so when I finally got a chance to see it at the cinema I spent the entire time thinking \\"OK, when do we get to the exciting bit?\\". The thing about 'Lost In Translation' is that it's not gripping or an adrenaline rush. In fact, it's quite the opposite. It sets the mood of temporary, somewhat self-inflicted, isolation through relatable, realistic characters. It seems more like a documentary than a movie. I found it more enjoyable on my second viewing on DVD (perhaps because I was prepared in advance for what sort of movie it is), and I suggest viewing it with an alcoholic drink and nuts rather than popcorn and a coke (you feel like you're sitting in that hotel bar with them). DVD is also a much more personal medium than cinema, and this is a very personal movie. It's amazing how the sprawling city of Tokyo is quite literally just a backdrop; this could be taking place anywhere at all. <br />I must admit I thought a few of the Japanese caricature characters were a bit annoying (though funny, all the same - just look at Bill's face when his translator is speaking to the director of the commercial he's filming), and the film isn't for everybody (many people I know hated it, calling it pointless - which it sort of was, but when you think about it, all films are rather pointless). I found the bonus fly-on-the-wall documentary very interesting; Sofia Coppola's voice is a bit annoying at times (she always sounds so bored), but I enjoyed watching how the shot all the street scenes, for example, when they are forced to pretend they are just having a coffee at Starbucks (to avoid police problems) in order to film a couple of shots of the street below them. Also, you'll notice that the Japanese don't look or wave at cameras at all; the shots of Scarlett Johansson working her way through the crowds in the subway station are completely natural. <br/>Bill Murray may have gotten all the praise, but Scarlett is the real break out star of this film, and deserved an Oscar nomination over the highly over-rated Diane Keaton. <br /> <br />In a nut shell, 'Lost in Translation' is a sentimental, melancholy, near-perfect film, heaped with brilliant performances from Bill Murray, a beautiful, elegant Scarlett Johansson, Giovanni Ribissi (or whatever his name is!) and a surprsingly good Anna Faris (although she is technically only playing an airhead version of herself).

B00064ADR0|5.0|November 4, 2004 <br />Artist: Johnny Winter  <br />Album: Second Winter (Deluxe Edition) <br />Rating: Great  <br /> <br />First things first, I love Johnny Winter. For me there's nothing like a well played guitar and few have the catalogue of licks that Johnny Winter seems to be able to throw down endlessly.  <br /> <br />This album, Second Winter, was originally released back in 1969 when \\"rock\\" music's golden age was peaking. Winter's band, which included brother Edgar and bass player Tommy Shannon (who would later back Stevie Ray Vaughan as a member of Double Trouble) had just played Woodstock before recording this album. With his anointed status as one of rock's upcoming superstar Winter had recently signed on as music's largest solo contract artist with Columbia Records for more than a million dollars: which in 1969 was still a lot of money. So the band was hot and the world was listening.  <br /> <br />Record companies mining the vaults for product is nothing new. Historically few labels have done it well. One of a couple of exceptions is Sony (CBS, Columbia, Epic, Okeh). Using the original recorded album, the label restore's the original album artwork and then remixes and remasters, adds in additional tracks and then, dig this, give you ANOTHER disc of new music. So the packaging is excellent and you get some really great tunes. Now that's smart marketing!  <br /> <br />The second disc in this package is a nine track live concert from the Royal Albert Hall in 1970 and includes the most excellent SLOW electric blues track, \\"It's My Own Fault.\\" While Winter may have been young he exhibits a litany of finesse and taste with his twelve minute cover this B. B. King track. The second disc also features the debut of brother Edgar's instrumental track, `Frankenstein' (which would become a hit five years later).  <br /> <br />The original album includes two additional studio tracks; `Early in the Morning' and `Tell the Truth.' Already known as one of the great bluesalbums, the newly reissued Second Winter is a MUST OWN disc for any true fan of the electric blues. It's only a minor leap to suggest that without this record and the success it brought to Winter there would never have been a scene to incubate a Lil' Stevie Vaughan.
B0006213WG|5.0|this cd is without a doubt sum 41s best cd yet. it is the first cd i dont skip around to listen to a certain song. every song is good. <br /> <br />intro - they didnt need this but it makes a cool follow up for the next song  <br /> <br />no reason - awesome song full of energy and has a catchy chorus 10/10 <br /> <br />were all to blame - this is the whole reason i got the cd but now i am getting burned off this song. its still a great sogn though. 10/10 <br /> <br />angels with dirty faces - top 5 best song at least. it starts off slow then comes with a fast pickup and has the best verses on the whole cd 10/10 <br /> <br />some say - one of my personal favorites. its an accoustic song by sum 41! the vocals are amazing and so are the lyrics 11/10 <br /> <br />bitter end - i dont listen to this one thata much its just really hard rock with not that good of vocals. its alright though just because its little solo. 6/10 <br /> <br />open your eyes - another one of my favorites. its really rough with an awesome intro and great dual vocals 10/10 <br /> <br />slipping away - this one is ok. its kinda slow and never really picks up. i personally think its a little too soft for sum 41. but i like it still 7/10 <br /> <br />im not the one - great song that is reminds me of their old stuff mixed with new stuff. its amazing how it goes together. 9/10 <br /> <br />welcome to hell - i went to their concert and they played this song. it had the most energy on the whole album andright when i heard it, this song became one of my favorites. 11/10 <br /> <br />pieces - probaly tied with some say and welcome to hell. this song if soft but has yet again amazing vocals. when they were in concert he played it on the keyboard and it was awesome. on the cd its guitar though. 11/10 <br /> <br />theres no solution - the most underated song on here. this is just as good if not better than the the other three i gave 11/10. i would have to give this one the same score. 11/10 <br /> <br />88 - agood ending song. its pretty goood i guess but not one of my personal favorites. i listen to it though. 8.5/10 <br />
B000000W5L|5.0|April 16, 2002 <br />Rating: \\"Great\\"  <br />Exile on Main Street  <br />The Rolling Stones  <br /> <br />If you look at rock music as an artform, within the pantheon of rock there are only a few albums that are truly great: albums that summarized where the artform had been and directed where it was going to go.  <br /> <br />In the early days of recordings an artist would record for a two song 78 rpm - so the ability to impact was restricted to a series of juke box singles. Artists like Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly, Eddie Cochran, and The Everly Brothers would fall into this category. The true magnitude of impact by musicians like Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, et al could only be recognized in retrospect.  <br /> <br />In the early `60's full length albums became a viable format and an artist could release a body of work that represented their \\"art.\\" While it's debatable, great music tends to synthesis previous influences, blend'em up, and come up with something new and unique; Miles Davis and David Bowie were chameleon masters of this process. Often bands who develop a formula for success end up repeating it and eventually burn it out; Journey, Styx, REO, 311, REM, U2, etc...  <br /> <br />In 1972 rock was still a relatively young artform and the album format was less than ten years old. With such a short history it was relatively easier to impact the genre than it is today - hence there are \\"more significant\\" albums in the `70's than there were in the `90's. Why? There were more than 30,000 albums were released last year. Couple a massive volume of releases with intense fracturing of genres, the idea that the true impact of an album cannot be viewed in the short term, and the weight of \\"great\\" albums are going to be found in the `60's and 70's with only a smattering in the 80's. A trend such as the Seattle Grunge sound may burn brightly for a short period of time and, in hindsight, have less impact than a movement such as rap/ hip-hop has had over an extended periodof time.  <br /> <br />Couple consideration of trends versus movements within the cyclic nature of rock and you simply cannot judge an albums (or bands) long term impact over a period of time of less than a decade. Thus the pronouncement by British magazine, \\"Q\\" that Radiohead's, `OK Computer' is the best album of all time is a ridiculously premature pandering to subscribers.  <br /> <br />During the early `70's rock was coming out of the `Age of Aquarius.' Baby Boomers were graduating from college and starting families and careers - opening the door of relevancy onto younger artists and even younger buyers. The Beatles, who literally wrote rock's book of royalty, had broken up. Altamont destroyed what Woodstock had memorialized, hard drug use began to wear down rock's first generation of stars taking the lives of Jimi, Janis, and Jim. Change was in the grooves. Led Zeppelin began to usher in the sound of \\"heavy metal\\" that actually defied the acoustic nature of their own music. Jethro Tull, ` Emerson, Lake, and Palmer', Yes and King Crimson were toying with an English blend of Classical Music and Rock. Bob Dylan's use of socially poignant lyrics impacted nearly everyone and Motown would continue to vanguard a black-white crossover sound.  <br /> <br />In the summer of `72, with the release of their first double album, The Rolling Stones would end a streak of four significant albums that began in 1968 with the blues laden acoustic record, `Beggars Banquet.' Exiled from England to avoid a tax rate of 98%, the Rolling Stones had moved to France. Recording in the basement of Keith Richards home, Exile on Main Street would be condemned by music critics as, \\" a fagged out masterpiece...barely afloat in it's own drudgery.\\" Indeed, on first listening the album is loose, long, and rough but like an onion the layers peel away with multiple listening reveling a rich blend of rhythm-n-blues, blues, Chuck Berry rock, a heavy influence of black gospel, and the raw country presence of Richards' foil Graham Parsons (who's band, `The Flying Burrito Brothers' had appeared with the Stones at the fated Altamont concert back in `69.) <br /> <br />Richards erratic waking & recording schedule was severely impacted by his descent into heavy narcotic use. As the recordings progressed members of the band would be absent; consequently the album centers around Richards, saxophone player Bobby Keys, and legendary British keyboard player Nicky Hopkins. In an bizarre twist, Exile on Main Street would declare in a muted voice the true force behind the artistic integrity of the band. While the singles, `Happy' and `Tumbling Dice' would propel the album to Billboard's #1 slot for 16 weeks that summer, the true genius of the album would be focused on three cuts. The album opener, `Rocks Off' is a snapshot of the band at it's full potential as the world's nastiest, grittiest, riff-hard funkiest best. As the horns pump and push the tempo, Nicky Hopkins ` keyboards are mixed up-front and example one of the finest British interpretations of boogie-woogie. In a reveling lyric Jagger gives a glimpse to the album's recording process, \\"The sunshine bores the daylights out of me, chasing shadows, moonlight mysteries.\\"  <br /> <br />The second track, `Sweet Virginia', clearly influenced by Richards relationship with Graham Parsons, showcases the band in an acoustic setting with Jagger on harmonica as they lope through a fine interpretation of Bakersfield country sounds. While waiting for his Toronto trial in 1978 Richards and Bobby Keys would revisit this roots country sound, recording an albums worth of Merle Haggard covers, originals, and a moving version of, `Somewhere Over the Rainbow.' Richards would gander a novelty hit for the Some Girls album with the countrified hit, `Far Away Eyes.' It was on the fourth side of Exile on Main Street that would showcase one of the band's finest studio moments in a 40+ year recording history.  <br /> <br />On `All Down the Line.' Mick Taylor's slide guitar work would contrast against Richards slicing riffs as drummer Charlie Watts and horns pumped the song down a proverbial train track. \\"You can't say yes and you can't say no, just be right there when the whistle blows...all down the line, we're gonna open up the throttle yeah.\\" As a pure moment, rock rarely reaches such a peak of perfection. For a brief moment in time, captured on four vinyl sides, all the roots of rock-n-roll would be blended by musicians capable of knowing the delicacy of each casting a commercial and artistic shadow that over the next 25 years the band would struggle to come out from.  <br /> <br />As if a wave goodbye to rock's infancy, never again would radio embrace such a rootsy sound. Exile on Main Street would serve as the final course at a banquet hosted by English kids who'd grown up listening to the blues & country music on American Armed Forces Radio during the `Siege of Britain' only to serve America back her own roots.  <br /> <br />This is rock music's finest recorded moment to date.

055321263X|4.0|In the 143 years since its publication, Wilkie Collins' The Woman in White (Random House Modern Library Classics, 1860) has never gone out of print. Originally serialized in Charles Dickens' weekly journal All the Year Round, it outsold Dickens himself in London and New York in 1860. <br /> <br />The novel (and Collins himself) is considered the forerunner to the modern mystery genre and the premise is as simple as it is delightful. London artist Walter Hartright is sent to Cumberland to teach drawing to two half-sisters. He falls instantly in love with Laurie Fairlie, the younger of the two, who is betrothed to a man of noble blood. When it becomes obvious that the fair and delicate Laura's new husband has dastardly intentions, Walter and the older, spinster sister, Marian, are set off on a thrilling chase to rescue Laura and solve the riddle of the woman in white. <br /> <br />Part of the ongoing appeal of The Woman in White is certainly its status as a paragon of mid-Victorian literature. England in 1860 was a rural and aristocratic society coping with the rise of industrialization, urbanization, and the effects of a rapidly-growing middle class on the ideals of democracy. Literature of this time focused on realism - the creation of believable behavior, setting, and psychologically credible characters - combined with sensationalism - high drama and volatile passions. <br /> <br />Victorian readers expected a happy ending to a story that provided social commentary on the present condition of England and Collins delivered both. The Woman in White serves up a critique on class relations, insane asylums, foreigners, and Victorian feminism. <br /> <br />The story is told in a series of first-person narratives, each picking up where the other left off and continuing the plot from his or her own point of view. Collins based this style on court trials he witnessed while attending law school. His progressive class consciousness is revealed in giving a narrative voice toservants who help tell the story, while denying a voice to upper-crust characters such as Laura and her husband, Sir Percival Glyde. <br /> <br />Additionally, like much of Victorian literature, Collins addressing the question of what constitutes a gentleman. The rise of the British middle class spawned a debate as to whether money or morals conferred gentlemanly status. The evils of Sir Percival and his Italian mastermind, Count Fosco, compared to the innocent honor of the lowly drawing master place the designation of gentleman with a kindly heart rather than a thick wallet. Though Collins avoid eat-the-rich didacticism - Laura herself is quite wealthy, but not a villain. <br /> <br />The subplot of madness serves to show up the deplorable conditions of the Victorian asylum where it was possible to be falsely restrained by greedy relatives who then obtained all one's property. Several prominent cases like this preceded the publication of The Woman in White. Forced commitment to an asylum is a common theme in Victorian literature, probably reflecting fears over the narrow range of acceptable behavior that was considered normal and sane. The book's continued popularity may speak to a universal fear of losing one's identity, of having the whole world think we're crazy simply for speaking the truth. <br /> <br />Collins' views on foreigners are alluded to in his treatment of two central characters, both foreign-born Italians. Walter's servant, Pesca, is a bumbling fool but a loyal friend. Count Fosco is evil, yet cultured and clever. The apparently negative portrayal of Italians may be partially due to the British fear of Catholics during the Pope's vie for power in the mid-19th century. More likely, they were a product of the British Empire and the Crimean War, which ended shortly before publication. Victorian Brits justified the Empire with a belief that foreigners were irrational, childlike, irreligious, criminal, hypersexual, and dirty. The Italians were specifically targeted because they sided with the Austro-Hungarian Empire during the war. That Collins created Pesca and Fosco to be quirky and engaging characters is probably progressive in the same sense as a modern American writer might create a Middle Eastern Muslim character to be appealing to the reader without becoming a caricature of either good or bad qualities. <br /> <br />The Woman in White is probably best known as an expose' on the lot of the Victorian woman. Feminism in Victorian times is still recognizable today, influenced as it was by liberal Protestant evangelism, enlightenment appeals to reason, and the rise of communitarian socialism as a strong political force. \\"Ladies' reading societies\\" were cropping up in response to Susannah Wright urging women to \\"read yourselves into awareness\\". John Stuart Mill was being arrested for distributing information on birth control and attacking the traditional family, saying child-rearing should be communal. <br /> <br />Collins himself was known for being unsympathetic to the traditional family. He lived in a polygamous arrangement with two women he never married and once said his writing \\"dramatizes the domestic horror of marriage\\" and showed up the vagaries of marital law. <br /> <br />The novel compares four distinct female characters - Laura; her half-sister, Marian; Count Fosco's wife, Eleanor; and Anne Catherick, the titular women in white herself. Marian is arguably the story's richest character. Collins never mocks her and the reader is not left pitying her even though a Victorian spinster carried the stigma of pity. She mirrors Fosco's cleverness and culture, but for good instead of evil. Unexpectedly, at the time of publication, men contacted Collins wanting to know if Marian was based on a real woman because they wished to meet such a woman. It begs the question of whether the ideals in weight, beauty, and temperament to which women strive to please men have ever been what men really wanted in the first place. <br /> <br />In the shadow of Marian, there's Madame Fosco - temptress and shrew turned dutiful wife. Her subservience is wound into Count Fosco's villainy, yet Laura's subservience remains a symbol of virtue (perhaps Collins avoiding didacticism again). <br /> <br />In spite of her sweetness, Laura remains a two-dimensional character. The plot revolves around her, yet she's as lifeless on the pages as one of her own drawings. In the end, we're left pitying Laura's weakness rather than Marian's spinsterhood, which may have been Collins' intention. <br /> <br />But if Laura is the bright side of virtuous Victorian womanhood, Anne Catherick is its dark underbelly. Her truthful tongue and sharp mind mark her as insane. Her ineffectual weakness and lack of male protection are exaggerated into madness where she whispers in and out of the story - the wraith-like woman in white. <br /> <br />As a feminist novel, it's not without flaw. Collins stoops to portraying Marian as ugly and mannish, implying that she can't catch a man because of her indelicacy and her facial hair. (In point of fact, the number of mid-Victorian spinsters rose because of the women outnumbered the men.) We do watch Marian pine for love, yet it's her beautiful, passive half-sister who is rewarded with it. Though, given Collins' views towards marriage, he may have bestowed this as an ironic mixed reward. Rather than being strong or cunning in standing up to Sir Percival, Laura mostly resorts to the tired stereotype of childlike sneakiness. And here the book falls into the common trap, at least for the modern reader, of mistaking Laura's cunning or Marian's wit and spunk for genuine feminist analysis. This is a problem even in modern entertainment where we're supposed to believe the heroine is liberated when, in fact, she's only making cynical and sarcastic one-liners. But overall, Collins effectively shows the futility of both options for women - the lack of means and social stigma of spinsters and the legal and social disappearance of marriage. The modern reader is left to ponder whether this has really changed. <br /> <br />Characters aside, the heightened language of the novel is lovely and begs to be read aloud, despite a criticism of Collins is that his language was too flowery to accurately reflect Victorian English and, because he was paid by the word, some passages become unnecessarily wordy. To the modern taste, the book is simply too long for a suspense novel, weighing in at 645 pages. <br /> <br />The plot structure of the serial narratives diverges from the typical Victorian novel in which it was common for the author to interject with commentary in his or her own voice, addressed to the reader. The narrative format allows all the advantages of the omniscient viewpoint while keeping the immediacy and personal feel of the first person. <br /> <br />Some holes in the plot are distracting. A woman believed dead is able to marry. Chronological errors in dates (the result of the original serial publication) leave events occurring in nonsensical order. Characters appear and disappear with inexplicable suddenness. Some coincidences strain credibility. A case of typhoid fever figures into the story twenty years before typhoid was officially diagnosed (though it had become a matter of public health and medical inquiry in England at the time of publication). <br /> <br />The quality of The Woman in White is clearly overstated today because of its status as a period piece. In its day, it was little more than a trashy novel for mass entertainment - only slightly less degraded than the modern soap opera because of the evident social commentary. The overemphasis placed on The Secret is a cheap gimmick to lure the Victorian reader into purchasing the next installment. <br /> <br />In spite of this, and in addition to the social commentary, The Woman in White has literary value. Collins plants a fabulous story into the genre of the sensation novel. He uses the kindof symbolism meaningful to a Victorian audience - for example, fire was a common symbol for the tensions between stable, conservative, and restricting values versus destructive and liberating passionate emotion and sexuality. Witticisms are planted into the characters' names - Pesca can't swim yet, his name is Italian for \\"fish\\"; Fosco means \\"gloom\\"; Percival refers to the knight seeking the Holy Grail. <br /> <br />Collins' use of word painting is evocative and typically Victorian - for example, the description of Blackwater Park is both explanatory and creates an aura of evil. The coincidences, epiphanies, and mistaken identities are fun even when they're exaggerated. All in all, The Woman in White is likely to continue entertaining readers for another 140 years to come.
B00025ETIW|5.0|I think this is a really great CD.  I got a copy from a friend (because I am too cheap to buy it) and I put it in my CD player last Friday.  I have taken it out... but only to put it in other players.  It is a v. addicting CD and if you don't want to listen to the same thing, I discourage you from buying it.  It is a great CD, but it keeps you in the same room for hours. <br /> <br />The first song, Helena, is a great way to start off the CD. Really sets the mood.  The songs all flow into each other and it tells a great story. <br /> <br />But I think this CD is probably one of the best in my collection.  And I greatly encourage you to try it out.
B00005U122|3.0|as far i'm conerned, Roger Waters can do whatever the hell he wants to songs from The Wall, after all it was his brain child. But oh my holy god in heaven what has waters done to \\"wish you were here\\" ????!??!?! he just massacred the song to put it nicely. I have a certain liking to Snowy White because of his work as rythm guitarist for the Animals tours during the 70s (plus he looks friendly), but he sucks sooooo baaaad at lead guitar!!! just listen to the \\"wish you were here\\" intro solo!! i can do better! (i'm not joking i actually play guitar)argh, and the rest of the song is just murder, the vocals, everything...it's  like pissing on Syd Barret's face. anyways, there is some good stuff on this dvd...\\"dogs\\" for example is quite good, even though the beggining vocals are not that great (once again we sense Gilmour's absence). In my opinion Gilmour's dvd is TONS better than this (it's a completely different atmosphere too), it seems he was able to move on to different topics in his songwritting, as opposed to waters constantly whining about how bad his childhood was and how his daddy died in the war....it's like dude, get over it!!! even though it seems otherwise,  i love waters and most of his songwritting and bass playing...with the Floyd. unfortunately that will never be again *sighs*..... one final thing: unless you were solely a Waters fan (rather than apreaciating the rest of the floyd) or you only like The Wall,you'll probably love this. but if you liked the Floyd, especially gilmour's contribution, get the David Gilmour in concert dvd. to all of you other reviwers saying how well the other guitarists replace gilmour: go screw yourselves. The other dudes just play, verbatim (hey, music's a language, ain't it?),  the SOLOS THAT GILMOUR CAME UP WITH!!!
B000002LTU|5.0|Look ya'll need to stop hatin' on his later work and move on. 'Cuz this was hit the jackpot and a new direction to the jazz-rap or jazz and hip-hop genre. Check out Guru's 1st Jazzmatazz release too for a chance right after u picked this up.    This is one of the first I ever experienced of growing up listening to at 6 or 7 yrs. old.
B000000WHX|5.0|...if you got this album. 'Safe From Harm', 'Be Thankful For What You've Got', but especially 'Unfinished Sympathy' makes you feel like dancing. When I heard 'Unfinished Sympathy' for the first time is immediately started dancing (and I almost never dance, so that means alot). Although my favourite is 'Safe From Harm' because it has these very good lyrics and you almost start crying when you hear it. This is actually a mix of different genres, 'Blue Lines' is jazzy, 'Hymn Of The Big Wheel' is more like poppy, 'Five Man Army' (featuring Tricky) is more dub, hip hop. The rest of the track I haven't named yet I consider as chill out-tracks, because I can't really put a label on it. Just buy it and see for yourself, this is a must-have for all decent music-lovers. You won't regret it..
B00008AY3L|5.0|I just don't get some of the reviews of this cd. This is Possibly Ben's best to date: much better than the scattershot, <br />lousily produced Burn To Shine, Slightly more cohesive than The Will To Live, miles Above Welcome to the Real World and Fight For Your Mind. There just isn't a throwaway here, every track is strong, but Amen Omen could be Ben's best track. Like The Will To Live, there is a not so hidden spiritual agenda here, and it seems like Ben works best in that frame of mind.
B000002N25|5.0|I have been a Dire Straits fan for decades now, and was eagerly awaiting this CD when it was released in 1996. I was not disappointed. It truly is among a handful of CDs that I listen to over and over. Largely the content is more muted and leaning toward folk than Knopfler's earlier work with Dire Straits, with the rocking exception of \\"Imelda,\\" which sounds like it could have come off of any Dire Straits album from the 1980s.<br /><br />The songs are all generally strong, and interestingly some of them grew on me much faster than others. I loved \\"Golden Heart,\\" \\"Imelda,\\" \\"No Can Do\\" (which has an interesting shuffle beat), \\"Cannibals\\" (very zydeco), \\"Je Suis Desole,\\" and the cautionary tale of despotism, \\"Done With Bonaparte\\" immediately. Over the past few weeks I rediscovered what on reconsideration I believe to be the true gem of the album, the haunting love song \\"A Night In Summer Long Ago\\" featuring a strong Celtic influence (including a bouzouki, Uillean pipes, violin, whistle, and accordion) and perhaps the most poignantly rending lyrics Mark has ever written.<br /><br />The album isn't perfect, and I cite \\"Vic and Ray\\" and \\"Rudiger\\" as clunkers, although Mark is fond enough of \\"Rudiger\\" to perform it live frequently in his sets.<br /><br />This is a masterwork from the greatest guitarist living, and I highly recommend it to everyone.
B00005AQE8|5.0|I don't even know why I writing this review, because every music fan has this album, <br /> <br />but for anyone who's been living under a rock or is just a child (warning, has a lot of cussing, be advised)  <br />this is in my opinion the greatest album ever,  <br /> <br />followed real closely by Me Against the World, Makaveli, Until the End of time, and perhaps better dayz. <br />
B000006045|5.0|This album has blown me away for years now. I forget how or why I bought it in the summer of 98. I think the review I read in Rolling Stone, or whatever intrigued me. I do a lot of impulse buys like that. After buying and listening to it, I knew I had touched upon something special. It made me go out and get Protection and Blue Lines too. Mezzanine is far and away the greatest thing they have done. I love all the songs except Inertia Creeps. For some reason it always makes me tense with its dissonance. Otherwise the album flows very nicely. I too was let down by 100th Window, but I suppose after Mezzanine almost anything would be a let down. I await the release of Danny The Dog very eagerly. I havent heard any of the music, but apparently it is available to some. Just not me. LOL It seems like it is going to be great, and Im going out tomorrow to buy it. If any stores are open that is. I credit Massive Attack for opening up my eyes to a wide variety of music I had heard of, but never really embraced. Bands like The Verve, Spiritualized, Thievery Corporation, Cocteau Twins and on and on. Massive Attack have their work cut out for them after such a seminal CD as Mezzanine. If they could come up with something like it before, I am certain they can do it again. Bravo!
B00028HBKC|2.0|I am so glad that I did not purchase copies of this to send out <br />to friends as a Christmas Gift.  It turned me off not being in <br />English.  shifting my eyes up and down to read and look at the <br />action on the film I found distracting.  If I could have heard it in English it would have been able to feel it more.  The tenderness, anger was lost for me.  Hearing Jesus voice so that I could understand the hurt, anger and sadness in it would have <br />kept my attention.  The blood looked like Kechup, it was a turn off.  When Veronica whiped his face when he fell itlooked like she was trying not to rub off his makeup.  The cut of his side <br />pored blood out like a fountain.  This would never happen in real life and when he died I cracked up laughing at the ground <br />spliting apart and the urns turned over.  The fire didn't even <br />spill out, it remained in the urn.  It was all so fake.  The greatest turn-off was the reading everything.  If I wanted to read I could have stayed home and read a book.  Good Points..... <br />The Scenes were great, spread across the screen.  The costumes <br />were excellent, Great color and some great acting although Jesus <br />was a little overdone.  I was dissapointed.  With all it had going for it I found it silly when I was looking forward to something profound and moving.  Maybe it could be dubbed in English, it would help. I know I would have enjoyed it better and rated it 50 instead of the 2 for effort.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|is by singing loud for all to hear. <br /> <br />I bought Elf this fall on DVD and have seen it five times already. This is probably one of the best holiday films to date. It takes from various Christmas movies and TV specials (the references to Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer and It's a Wonderful Life are seen in the movie). Buddy's enthusiasm throughout the whole movie should be a word of encouragement to everybody during a holiday season which can be depressing and leaves many people stressed out. I thought that I should rate the main characters in the movie <br /> <br />Buddy - Has an enthusiasm throughout the whole movie that should be teaching us all a lesson at the holidays. <br /> <br />Walter - The shut down, self centered, money obsessed father who does not want Buddy in his life and even denies his existence.  It takes going with Michael to find Buddy in Central Park that he finally warms up to Buddy. <br /> <br />Emily- The only one who really liked the elf and kept the family together. She thought it was kind of weird that Buddy liked syrup on everything and freaked out when Buddy dropped his pants in the kitchen. Sings pretty well at the end too when the best way to spread Christmas Cheer is to sing loud for all to hear. <br /> <br />Jovie- The cute department store elf whom Buddy has feelings for and even takes her out on the town. He helped her get through the holidays with his enthusiasm. She has a great singing voice too. <br /> <br />Michael- The son who looks at Buddy as the father figure that Walter obviously never was. I find it hilariously funny when he and Walter tell the a*hole president of Greenway off and go find Buddy. <br /> <br />Miles Finch- I didn't know Walter had elves working for him... he's an angry elf. I like the scene where he and Buddy are fighting during the big sales pitch that would have saved Walter's job. <br /> <br />President- Worst character in the movie... looks like the Ditech guy. He is completely miserable. He deserved to lose money for the quarter. I like how Walter tells him \\"up yours\\" towards the end. What a jerk Greenway was. <br /> <br />Good use of old CBS characters from the 1970's as well <br />Santa- The role Ed Asner was born to play. He had success with Mary Tyler Moore and Lou Grant in the 70's on CBS and comes back in 2003 to play the big man. Nice job, Ed. <br /> <br />Papa Elf- Bob Newhart really comes through as the one who raised Buddy as a child. Heck, even the baby was bigger than him.  <br /> <br />These characters weren't used as much except in the beginning and end but still did a great job acting.
B0002VEPRQ|4.0|After being passed over for the role of Eliza Doolittle for the film version of MY FAIR LADY (the role she created on Broadway) for the more \\"loverly\\" but less vocally-skilled Audrey Hepburn, Andrews was recruited for Mary Poppins personally by Walt Disney who offered the role to her on the spot after seeing her in CAMELOT. Once given a chance to prove her screen presence she managed to turn in a number of very memorable and diverse film roles, though she is mostly remembered for her two singing nanny roles, Mary Poppins and Maria von Trapp.<br /><br />The 40th Anniversary DVD set of MARY POPPINS s chock full of interesting extras--interviews with Andrews and VanDyke, making-of featurettes, a game, etc. I found the black and white archival footage of the Hollywood Premier to be especially fascinating. Although there is nothing critical of the movie, the Disney studios, or Disney the man in these extras--and you do feel a bit manipulated into a sense of awe--MARY POPPINS was a great achievement that took Disney many years to pull off. You can't really begrudge the man his bragging rights. (In the trivia track of the movie, the studio is quick to assert that if the initial box-office take were recalculated based on current ticket prices, MP would be the top grossing film of all time, out-performing THE LORD OF THE RINGS, etc.).<br /><br />The DVD extras also helped me to understand things about the movie that have always bothered me. The music, though catchy in its own way, is consciously composed based on elements of the British music hall which I think accounts for their slightly cold, alien quality (As an American unconsciously influenced by African-American and jazz idioms, I think my ear naturally craves minor chords and more complex rhythms). Also, the featurettes reveal that the books the movie was based on were really a collection of amusing stories rather than novels with beginnings, middles and ends. It was the Disney writers who consequently had to provide the overarching story line. And in bizarre and typical Disney fashion (who in their 50s today was not traumatized by the death of Bambi's mother? or Dumbo's separation from Jumbo?), it pivots on child abandonment issues. I remember seeing MP 40 years ago and being very upset by how blithely Mary floated out of the children's lives after having worked her magic--no promise to send post cards, visit once a year on their birthdays, or attend their graduations. True, she functioned as a catalyst in the life of the children's family and was responsible for turning the neglectful, business-obsessed father and women's-suffrage-obsessed mother into caring and attentive parents, but that does little to offset the bittersweet sadness of seeing Mary lift off and float out of the young children's lives forever. I remember thinking at the time, \\"She was just pretending to like the kids all along. Looking after them was just a job for her. How cold!\\"<br /><br />The true achievement of MARY POPPINS, however, was the way Disney combined animation with live action, something we probably take for granted today. Perhaps because it was harder to do this \\"back then\\", such sequences were well thought out in MP and never seem gratuitous. To those people who don't like to be shown \\"how it's done\\" and want to preserve the mystery, I would say, just ignore the \\"extras\\" disk. But I found the \\"how to\\" stuff fascinating--especially Ed Wynn's laughing tea party scene and the phenominal chimney sweepers rooftop dance number.<br /><br />The Anniversary edition of MARY POPPINS is worth the purchase price. You'll find yourself watching the movie AND the extras disk many times over.ide the overarching story line.

B00004Z400|5.0|Deftones is one of my favorite bands next to Korn, their music is just so different even though it sounds like simple riffs, i just don't know what is different about them. This album is amazing and heavy but spooky and melodic. The best song on here is Digtial Bath, the lyrics are amazing, about chino having a dream of dropping something electrical into a bathtub with a woman in it. Other good songs are Change, Back to School, Korea and Passenger. Chino deserves a place in greatest metal singers of all time due to his spooky whispering and awesome screaming with very intellgent and personal lyrics.

B0002ZDVEU|3.0|I've been watching movies for a long time,50 years, to be exact. <br />One of the main ideas is that some movie-makers are not making action movies anymore. They're making action blurs/blurbs, like music videos, etc. When there is an action scene, you can't see what's going on;you have to infer as to what is happening?? I remember action films such as \\"Enter the Dragon\\", Bruce Lee, where you could clearly see and hear the actors/stuntpersons as they performed their crafts. <br /> <br />Today, the films (many) seem to be made in a coldron of boiling water. The audio is very low (almost inaudible)or mumbly/gargley. I turned my home audio system up in order to be able to hear it better and comprehend the low throaty words. <br /> <br />Then an action scene rushes in and blasts the  <br />Heavens out of kilter. I suppose it may seem that I am picking on  <br />this one movie (The Bourne Supremacy), but actually, this one reminds me of what's wrong with many of the newer ideas in movie-making. To bad, I really wanted to see it, but once I started watching and listening, I was forced to remember some of the negatives which is inherent the newer (1998 - now) action movies. A saving grace, perhaps is that Matt Damon is a very good actor and the plot is great. Wish I could have enjoyed the clearity of action; and the audibility of <br />normal speech without action . . .
B00005JN0T|4.0|This is most certainly an enjoyable film, provided that what you're looking forward to are cool action sequences rather than an adaptation of Asimov's short story collection or a statement on the nature of the soul. The latter two are barely existent in the film and, in my opinion, that's a good thing. I, Robot is a movie meant to work as a summer popcorn flick, and it definitely does. <br /> <br />Will Smith, who carries so much charisma with him that he's impossible not to like in whatever role he takes on, is pretty much perfect in the film's lead role, Detective Del Spooner. Bridget Moynahan, as Dr. Susan Calvin, though, is absolutely awful. Granted, she's a lot of fun to look at, and maybe we needn't be asking more of anyone in a popcorn flick, but I found her performance to be bad to the point of annoyance. The special effects, especially those concerned with the robots' facial expressions, are exceedingly well done and worth the price of a rental on its own. Director Alex Proyas, who was all dark alleyways and bare light bulbs in Dark City, crafts a considerably lighter film here. <br /> <br />Recommended. A great film to kick back and relax with on a weekend.
B0006399FS|1.0|<br />First of all, I'm a die hard U2 fan. Neverthless I have to admit this album is just a fake. It's just a copy from ATYCLB. <br /> <br />20 Years ago U2 sang \\"in the name of love, what more in the name of love\\". <br /> <br />Nowadays those words seems to be \\"in the name of money, what more in the name of love\\". <br /> <br />U2 must retire, really. We have been waiting for 7 years for truly NEW music. Shameful <br /> <br />It's really easy to sell several millions with a name like U2, no matter album itself. They just need that name, sunglasses and black clothes, brianwashed fans and big marketing, that's all. <br /> <br />I've listened the album COMPLETE at least 30 times, and it was nothing to \\"grows\\" on me. The more I listen to it, the more I hate it !!.  <br /> <br />What should be \\"best\\" U2 songs? One Step Closer ? Original Of Species ? Sometimes You Can't Make It ? A Man And A Woman ? Love And Peace Or Else ? please give me a break. I'm not a child Bono. <br /> <br />Do fans a favor Paul Hewson:  <br /> <br />1- Shut Up. No more \\"best U2 album\\" and all that crap. <br />2- Retire and stop stealing money <br />3- Stop being cynical and talk about Iraq, Mid East, Bush, etc, etc. Where's your white flag ? I really think that one became the star spangled banner you love. <br />4- Release remastered classic albums ( from Boy to Pop, without any filler DVD's and \\"collector's editions\\" ) and unreleased live footage DVD's instead. <br /> <br />Thank You.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|The level of critical acclaim accorded this movie is, after watching it myself, a real surprise. Certainly, it is a good movie, but that it should be given a place on the AFI's Top 10 Films of the year list seems a little ridiculous. <br /> <br />The movie has three very good things going for it - Cruise, Foxx and Michael Mann. Cruise's performance is excellent. In my opinion, his best in recent memory. The reason for this is, largely, that it doesn't seem as if he's playing \\"Actor Tom Cruise\\". In many of his recent films, his performances have been remarkably similar and it feels as if he's only been going through the motions. In Collateral, he brings something different to the role and it's a refreshing change. Foxx, as ordinary cabbie Max who carts around Cruise's hitman Vincent, is also excellent. What really elevates this film above the level of your typical action-thriller, however, is the direction of Michael Mann. The film is kept remarkably taut as soon as Vincent gets into Max's cab, but Mann does this without sacrificing top-notch visuals. What keeps this film from being truly excellent is Stuart Beattie's run of the mill screenplay. The film is filled with traditional suspense movie sequences (ie. shootout set to electronica in a crowded dance club) and the ending is telegraphed early on (making Mann's feat of keeping everything suspenseful all the more awe-inspiring).  <br /> <br />Recommended. Great acting and direction, but only an average script.

B0002OERI0|5.0|I was really suprised hearing what they've done with this album, this is Green Day doing a (Punk)Rock Opera.   I have to say it's the best they've done since Insomniac.   Dookie was great. Insomniac was great (yet highly underrated) Nimrod and Warning were dissapointments.  Now they're back at making really catchy songs, this time even songs clocking over 9 minutes (!)  the Best song is Jesus of Suburbia.    I've read some user comments saying that they stole the concept from Nofx 1999 album \\"The Decline\\", well as a matter of fact the first punk rock opera album was released 15 years (!) before The Decline, The Subhumans' \\"From the cradle to the Grave\\"!.

B00000099Y|5.0|I think the production speaks for itself.  If you hate later releases, y'all should pick up this one (besides the latest incarnation called A Perfect Circle isn't that great to all listeners).  The artwork looks...well...musically adoring!  Enjoy!
0385513755|5.0|If you love conspiracy theories and thrillers then this book is for you.<br />Personally, I found the book very interesting and provoked a lot of questions. The plot is nothing to write home about, but it has a very nice pace and is suspenseful enough to be a good page turner. I got through this book in just a couple of days and I'm by no means a quick reader.<br />I think there is too fine a line on the question on what is fact and what is fiction, other then the obviously fictitious plot, but that may be the point. Devote christians may not like the ideas and/or facts presented in this book, but as a catholic myself I found the hidden histories fascinating.<br />If you want a satisfyingly good book to read, then pick it up or borrow it from a friend. I think a good 80% of the people I know have read it, so it's obviously popular.<br />Also, I haven't read Angels and Demon, Dan Brown's other book, but this book has interested me so much that I want to read that one too.
6305603847|5.0|I have been a Pink Floyd fan for years and years. Their music is inspiring, haunting, and meaningful. Incredible, unique lyrics and music make this band both original and a joy to listen to. <br /> <br />That said, it has only been since last year that I have first viewed this film. <br /> <br />The Wall is a well-thought-out movie that puts the entire The Wall album (plus a few new tracks) together and tells the amazing, eerie story through video. The actors/actresses all play their parts well, and the video portions, acted and animated, fit the Pink Floyd atmosphere beautifully. <br /> <br />The Wall takes you on a wild ride with a depressed rocker by the name of Pink Floyd (believe it or not!) who is addicted to drugs, has no free time on his hands due to his fame, and has suffered years of depression from his failing marriage, his awful childhood, and the fact that nobody will listen to him anymore. Pink, throughout the film, builds a wall of hatred and isolation around himself to try to bear with the fear that he gives himself from recalling these events in his life. Things turn for the worse when his wife cheats on him because he ignores her, and his true colors appear when he starts a white-extremist radical hate group. At the end of the movie he gets \\"judged\\" by those who most effected his life. <br /> <br />The movie is just an incredible experience. The darkness, the emotion, the hatred, that is given off by this movie is chilling and meaningful. Don't watch this movie if you have a very soft stomach, or if you found that films such as A Clockwork Orange were too disturbing to watch. This movie will make you think, and it is one of the most depressing, disturbing, hateful movies that I have ever seen. <br /> <br />However, if you can bear with the overwhelmingness of this film, I guarantee your life will be changed forever.
B00000JIL1|5.0|This was the final Rory Gallagher album that I bought and I searched high and low for this baby.  Unfortunately, it's out of print in the states but was lucky enough to stumble across it while in Ireland. (Ever notice how hardly anything goes out of print in Europe?) Anyway, I definitely got the best Gallagher last because this one smokes.  It starts off with the very laid back \\"I'm not Awake Yet\\" which features Rory strumming along on acoustic while Gerry and Wilgar hold everything up with a solid rhythm.  He then transitions into full on rock mode with \\"Used to Be\\", a fantastic piece with a start-stop riff that gets in your head and won't leave.  \\"Don't Know Where I'm Going\\" is a fun acoustic track.  \\"In Your Town\\" showcases his substantial slide technique in the form of a rollicking, stomping riff complete with great lyrics and some wonderful vocals.  You can just see Rory grinning while singing. (The version of Live in Europe is even better).  But the absolute gem of this album is \\"Crest of a Wave\\", perhaps the most volatile track Rory ever committed to tape.  While Wilgar and Gerry hold down the fort with one of the heaviest, thundrous, most unshakeable blues rhythms I've ever heard (Page, eat your heart out), Rory's slide playing enters the stratosphere and keeps on going to the place where the earth meets the sky. The solos are absoultely insane as Rory makes his Strat scream and shout. The entire song lives and breathes. And the brief studio banter after the ride-out is cool as well. In fact, there's not a bad track on here. Of all his studio work, Deuce is the culmination of everything that was and is Rory Gallagher.  If you ever run across this is a used record shop, pick it up and be carried off by this amazing album by one of the greatest musicians ever.
B00002E224|5.0|Sensitively directed by Richard Linklater (who was responsible for 1993s Dazed and Confused), it is essentially the tale of two people who meet as strangers and part as incredibly close friends only a few hours later - possibly to never meet again. But it offers so much more on closer inspection than that simple synopsis. <br /> <br />Celine (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) meet on a train travelling between Vienna and Budapest. Both are in their early twenties and appear to be looking for something in their lives. Celine is French and heading back to Paris after visiting her grandmother. Jesse is an American and heading to Vienna to catch a cheap flight home to the States. The two meet quite by accident on the train, but soon strike up a conversation and instantly 'click'. They talk for some time before Jesse realises he must leave Celine when the train arrives in Vienna so he can catch his flight home. But he comes up with the crazy idea of asking her to join him when in Vienna, and just hang out in the city for the night. With his flight not scheduled to leave until next morning he wasn't planning on going to a hotel, but rather just wander the streets and take in the sights of the Austrian capital. <br /> <br />Celine agrees and together they leave the train and explore the streets, meeting locals, buskers, beggars, and even a fortune teller, all in between telling their life story to each other and pondering all sorts of worldly and ethical questions about love, life, and death. The two effectively cram more living into the period between sunset and before sunrise than many people would hope to do in a year. As the time approaches when Jesse must leave for his flight, the two begin to realise that this could be a life defining moment, and the turmoil is clearly evident as both try to decide whether they should advance this relationship or leave it at this one-off meeting. <br /> <br />When looking at the credits and realising that the character listed third is 'wife on train', you just know this whole film is going to be made or broken by the two lead actors. Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke carry the roles off to perfection. Watch the unbridled excitement in their first kiss or glances at each other they steal when huddled in a record store listening booth and the reaction as they catch each other doing it. This is priceless filmmaking and a real joy to watch. <br /> <br />
B0006284JQ|5.0|Hands down: one of the best ever.  Now sure, I've never been able to listen to any of Britney's cd's without wearing a set of sturdy ear plugs, and my dog will not participate in the catching of this particular compact disc - but all bickering aside:  Who needs good music anyway?  Been there, heard that.  That was a 90's trend.  New music at best is a sordid scene with litigation and sappiness written all over it.  However, where many ugly people who play bad music fail, Britney easily soars to the top of the heap.  Just look at the cover.  She is so god-damn gorgeous:  Just look at her sexy, scrumptious [...] poking out from under her fine-clad blouse, and shorts so deliciously tight that you can see the outline of her hot, wet <expletive deleted>.  Wow - even [...] could be proud at our fine young scantily musicians of today!  I am getting so hot writing this review that I will soon need to look at her pictures again.  I have already sent out for more britney cd's; my current ones have gotten quite sticky.  It hasn't been this good since \\"Age 14-ameteurs: the bare necessities\\".  So by all means get this cd at all costs, for the exquisite pictures it holds therein are to be treated as sacred.  Amen    P.S.  Oh and don't receive any \\"used\\" cd's of Britney or Christina from your friends.....I was appalled at what my nasty friends had done.  You people disgust me!
0790729393|5.0|Sleepers is a very powerful and disturbing movie. It chronicles the life of four boys growing up in \\"Hell's Kitchen\\", New York in the 1960s. It is told through the eyes of one of the boys, \\"Shakes\\" (Joe Perrino). Hell's Kitchen was a very rough place to grow up. However, a strict code of honour existed, and crimes against the person were not tolerated. A central character in this human drama was the parish priest, Father Bobby (Robert De Niro), a no-nonsense rough-and-ready representative of God.  <br />The four boys - Shakes, Michael , John and Thomas - are inseparable, and they all get up to the usual adolescent hijinks, until one day something goes horribly wrong and they find themselves sentenced to incarceration at the Wilkinson Home for Boys. The Home is a brutal place, with physical, mental and sexual abuse almost a matter of routine, particularly by a foursome of guards headed by Nokes (Kevin Bacon).  <br />Their time passes, and the four are released. They grow up, but their lives are forever damaged. One day, the adult John and Thomas happen across Nokes in a bar, a seemingly perfect setup for revenge.  <br />Sleepers will disturb you. The imagery is often very graphic, and the subject matter is unpleasant. The movie takes a no nonsense and no glamour approach to its subject matter. The acting is absolutely top notch, and a superb ensemble cast make this story all the more dramatic and tragic.  <br />
B000007XUQ|4.0|I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because the remastering on the 1st cd is just horrible. Why is Karen's voice swimming in all that reverb? Listening to my old Christmas Portrait cd the mix on her voice is so intimate and warm but on this 2cd edition it's like she's far far away. In fact, the whole album has too much reverb in the mix, but if you pretend you're in a church it somehow makes it almost, almost ok. :-)  <br /> <br />That is my only complaint really because everything else about this collection is beyond perfection. I get tears in my eyes every time I listen to this music, and you can't get rid of that smile on your face everytime you hear all the playful arrangements and wonderful orchestrations. Every song that Karen sings is out of this world... her best performances are right here, all packaged onto a 2 disc set. Gorgeous.
B00009XITQ|2.0|It's hard work cramming as many clichs as you can into a film and success isn't always forthcoming, however I'm pleased to announce that in What A Girl Wants the clich level has been maintained to its fullest and it's a rip roaring clich success! <br />Let's walk through it now...  <br />A little girl named Daphne Reynolds lives with her hippie mother. She is told the tale of how the cool singer (Kelly Preston) met a mysterious hippie (Colin Firth) in Morocco. They were wed Bedouin style and then went to London, where hippie guy lived. It turns out he's next in line to be a Lord and his Dad (the current Lord) just died. Now the Evil Advisor (Jonathan Pryce) gets rid of the new Lord's true love to mould him into a proper English gent and such. <br />Fast forward 17 years. Hippie girl was pregnant when run off the ranch, and now her daughter, Miss Wayout, wants to find her father. She jets off to London to find him (to strains of The Clash singing London Calling, of course) and it turns out he's a big politician about to be married to some troll from under a bridge. Miss Wayout (Amanda Bynes) arrives and is naturally all teenage and stuff, like, and she doesn't, like, fit in like, you know? Troll (daughter of original Evil Advisor) is trying to get rid of her so she can be the Lord's wife (once he gets into power of course). Unfortunately, Miss Wayout was just what the stuffy English doctor ordered, because all of English society loves her and her zany, madcap adventures. (You can guess the rest if you like, but I'll give it to you anyway). <br />Aimed primarily at girls between ages ten through 18, this is nothing we've not seen before. Riddled with clichs and awkwardness (Daphne falls over or bangs her head no less than five times) this is a very predictable film with very little to offer as a story (one thing I'd really like to know though, is why these films all promote `being yourself and individual' yet they all tell the same story in the same way? Isn't that a teensy bit hypocritical?) <br />Anyway, while it has some moments of humour, to me it all smacks like a million other teenage girl films I've watched and by the end I was pretty glad it was over. Kelly Preston is wasted, Colin Firth and Jonathan Pryce are as well, and the supporting cast seem to get most of the screen time. This has also been very loosely based on The Reluctant Debutante, a stage play by William Douglas Home, but I'm fairly sure he wouldn't recognise it. <br /> <br />
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I have been a big Avril fan for years, and her music just keeps getting better! I loved Let Go; I still love Let Go, but Under My Skin is even better! Overall it's more rock, and the lyrics are deeper, and the music itself is more complexe. Under My Skin is without a doubt the best CD on Earth, and Avril Lavigne is without a doubt the best artist on Earth! I bought this CD 13 minutes after Borders opened the day it came out and listened to it for 52 hours in the first week (beating my record for Let Go by 31 hours!), and have perhaps listened to the entire album thousands of times since, so this is not an album one can easily get sick of! Here is my review for each song: <br />Take Me Away: 4/5 this is a great rock song with a great melody <br />Together: 5/5 This is easily one of my favorites. The lyrics are great, the music itself is great and there is a great piano overflow! <br />Don't Tell Me: 4/5 A great song with a strong message! <br />He Wasn't: 5/5 A great rock song with a fast tempo.  <br />How Does It Feel: 4/5 A really good, slow song about being thrown into the real world and feeling a bit lost. <br />My Happy Ending: 5/5 By far the best song of the year! Everything in the song is great! <br />Nobody's Home: 5/5 Also one of the best songs of the year! The lyrics are deep, the music is complexe, all of Avril's talents are exemplified in this song! <br />Forgotten: 4/5 Honestly, I did not like this song at first, but it has grown on me, and I now find that it is a great song! I would have to say it is the darkest song on the album. <br />Who Knows: 5/5 A great, lively, optimistic song  <br />Fall To Pieces: 5/5 A great, slow, love song. (I also think that Avril should have performed this at her concerts) <br />Freak Out: 5/5 This is yet another of my favorite songs. It's optimistic, and has a lively melody. <br />Slipped Away: 5/5 This is a slow, sad song and is a tribute to Avril's late grandfather.  <br /> <br />
B0000714BP|5.0|This film, with an intriguing but somewhat unwieldy title, tends to be compared with another film with a very similar plot: The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. Critics (especially Australian ones) love to point out similarities in plot, except that Priscilla does it so much better, and in a less sentimental, hackneyed and clich-ridden way. However, I really enjoy To Wong Foo..., and don't necessarily think of it as being inferior to Priscilla. <br />Two drag queens, Vida Boheme (Patrick Swayze) and Noxzeema Jackson (Wesley Snipes) jointly win the first prize in a local drag queen beauty contest in New York City - this wins them the cost of the travel expenses to Hollywood, California and back to allow them to participate in a national competition. <br /> <br />Another contestant, Chi Chi Rodriguez (John Leguizamo) is devastated that she did not win. Taking pity on her, Vida convinces Noxzeema to let Chi Chi accompany them - by trading in the plane tickets for a used car. Through the help of a cameo appearance by Robin Williams, they obtain an old Cadillac convertible with more style than substance (which you just know will break down in the middle of nowhere). <br /> <br />On the way, the stop by at Vida's hometown, join a ladies' basketball convention, and have a very close encounter with a red-necked highway cop - Sheriff Dollard (Chris Penn)! Then, as you would have guessed, the car breaks down and the queens are left stranded until they get rescued by a \\"knight in a shiny pickup truck\\" - innocent wide-eyed Bobby Ray (Jason London) who hails from the small town of Snydersville. <br /> <br />Unable to get spare parts for the Cadillac over the weekend, the trio are stranded in Snydersville over the weekend. Gradually, they get to know the inhabitants of the hamlet, but will the local folks ever find out that the three \\"career girls\\" from New York City are not quite what they seem? In turn, how will the trio affect the lives of the various people, including local hotel owner Carol Ann (Stockard Channing) who is being abused and beaten by her husband Virgil (Arliss Howard)? <br /> <br />Part of the film's charm (or irritation, depending on your point of view) is its relentless \\"wholesomeness.\\" Indeed, apart from a minor plot detail (cross-dressing), this could have been a Doris Day film. It seems eager to preach a message of tolerance and goodwill: tolerance/acceptance of alternative lifestyles, racism, small town vs. big city prejudices, relationships between men and women, and even differences across the generation gap. <br /> <br />I'm sure some people went to see this film just to find out how (through the magic of film-making and lots of make-up) three rather butch and handsome actors look dressed up as women. I must admit, they look darned good - and of course the film helps by making the \\"real\\" women in the cast look as dowdy as possible. <br /> <br />Many critics have commented on how studiously the plot avoids any hint of sex on the part of the three main characters, to the point where the film got awarded a PG-13 rating in the US (PG in Australia). We are supposed to believe that three red-blooded drag queens go on a road trip and ... nothing happens, apart from a bit of coquettish flirting from Chi Chi. Instead, the three somehow turn into relentless do-gooders that transform the lives of those they come into contact with. <br /> <br />Then again, maybe the critics are just simply not reading the sub-text of the plot hard enough. After all, the film pretty much articulates what I suspect is a typical male cross dresser's fantasy - to be able to dress as a woman 100% of the time in public, to actually look beautiful and draw the attraction of passing males, and finally to be accepted by society. <br /> <br />There are some nice cameo appearances by real life drag queen RuPaul, supermodel Naomi Campbell, plus the real Julie Newmar.  <br />
B00008CLOA|5.0|Ok, I read some reviews of this album and I agree that this may be a little dated...what from 1973?  But, this was from an area that rock 'n' roll was musically it's best.  Pink Floyd, Led Zepplin, Eric Clapton, just to name a few that helped make music what it was.  At that time lyrics with electrifying guitar riffs made music, influenced people, and in some cases put a shiver down your spine.  When you heard an artist or band, you could recognize them.  Now days most music is distored bar chords, crappy lyrics, and every frontman sounding like the other.  So to conclude...Pink Floyd and \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" get a thumbs up for musical talent that can extend so far into the future that a group of people will still comment on it today.  [...]
B0006419J6|4.0|I, Robot is science fiction at its very best. While it may have looked like just another summer blockbuster in the trailer it is far from it in reality. The story at its core is quite profound, and the fact that an artificial intelligence could determine that mankind could not be trusted with its own survival does have a distinct sense of irony. There is a part of me that does sympathize with VIKI - you have but to look at the 6-o'clock news on any given day to see why. The world is constantly in turmoil but then again who's to say that a machine could do any better.  <br /> <br />The special effects of I, Robot are quite simply amazing. The robots seem to blend seamlessly into the world around them so much so that there is seldom a moment where the reality of the film is ever questioned. The animation of Sonny in particular is truly astonishing - the subtleties in his performance remarkable. As you may well have guessed the process in which Sonny was brought to life was almost identical to that of Gollum from Lord Of The Rings. <br /> <br />The performances too are top shelf - Will Smith brings a great deal of personality and humour to a role which could have potentially been a stock standard affair. Bridget Moynahan, Bruce Greenwood and James Cromwell also put in a great performances, but perhaps the highlight performance is from the only lead actor you never see in the flesh (except for one frame as explained in the second commentary track). Actor Alan Tudyk's performance as Sonny is inspiring to say the least and as you will see in the behind-the-scenes material it was his performance which drove the animation of Sonny, right down to the minuscule facial movements. <br /> <br />The icing on the cake is that the film is also directed by  Alex Proyas, whose previous directorial efforts include The Crow, Dark City and most recently Garage Days.I, Robot is a sensational futuristic thriller that will for many years stand tall in the science fiction genre. If you liked Minority Report then I, Robot is a film for you.  <br /> <br />
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Good movie, touching romance and our hero Shaun, is a great every man, sure he come off as a bit of a loser, but when it hits  the fan he stands up to the challenge.  No the zombie apacolypse(oops i said the \\"z\\" word) brings out his best!!<br /><br />The extra features are fun, so is the commentary again on the shaun scale 10 pints...oi!
B0002KVUKM|3.0|Hugh Jackman has to have more talent than to be in big noisy special effects pieces like this.  It isn't so much that this is a bad story as it is burdened with so much noise, hyperkinetic special effects, and the kitchen sink.  I mean everything about all monster movies is thrown into this thing including Q from the James Bond series.<br /><br />But my main gripe is that human beings cannot fall hundreds of feet and be just fine.  I mean, if you have super heroes and monsters and all that, the real humans have to stay limited to real human powers to make the monsters exceptional.  If you make the people nearly as exceptional as the monsters you diminish the whole movie.<br /><br />Anyway, it was fun in the way a 2nd rate roller-coaster ride is fun.  You know you aren't really getting to the edge of things, but if you turn off your brain, you can enjoy the ride.
B00005AW41|4.0|When the electronic scene exploded in the mid to late nineties, one of the bands that stood out from the house and trance dominated genre was daft punk.  With their electro-pop epic Homework (1997), they single-handedly set the bar for electronic LP's and broke the mold of the mindless dance format.  Combining simplistic yet brilliant hard hitting beats, grinding yet melodic synth lines, and the perfect amount of vocoder (that electronic voice sound); Homework went against the grain and was a perfect album in every way, not just in the electronic music field but in music in general.   <br />    Discovery followed Homework four years later when the electronic scene had shifted to a more commercially acceptable club atmosphere instead of the underground rave scene and it was definatly reflected in the album.  Being their sophmore album I was looking forward to somthing similar to Homework and was initially disapointed in the incredibly retro sounds of Discovery.  Sounding somthing like Midnight Star meets Brian Wilson circa 1968, this album is very Poppy.  It could be played at chucky cheeze or major magic's as easily as it could be played at a trendy European disco-tech.  However if it is taken with a grain of salt and the hope that some kitschy elements were added knowingly; the album starts to become incredible.  Songs like Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger, Crescendolls, and One more time- become instant classic party anthems the first time you hear them if you don't take them to seriously. <br />  All and all I think the album went a bit too far with the lightness of the sound (I can not forgive the line \\"music got me feelin' so free, celebrate and dance so free).  You can only eat so much cool whip before you get sick.  So for this sole reason I gave it 4 insted of 5 stars.  Still highly recomended.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|This was a very entertaining thriller.  Tom Cruise is a very fine villain and Jamie Foxx does an even better job as the fish out of water hero.  I don't want to say anything about the plot because it is the movement of that plot from what you are set up to expect to what happens that is the real payoff of the movie.  Jada Pinkett Smith plays the super competent (but anxiety filled) and beautiful prosecuting attorney with a good balance of strength and vulnerability.<br /><br />I have to say that Mark Ruffalo and Peter Berg playing the undercover cops and Bruce McGill as the fed do very good work in unfolding the story in a certain direction.  Javier Bardem has a brief but memorable appearance as the drug king pin Felix.  Well, he is more of a mid-level manager of a drug dealing operation, but you will understand all this after you have seen the flick.<br /><br />Cruise's character, Vincent, is usually a pretty cold - force of nature kind of murderer, but he has his own flaws and manages his progress through the plot without perfection.  Foxx's embodiment of Max is actually quite good.  Max has to undergo not only a transformation, but some self-realization that he has been avoiding for quite awhile.<br /><br />I don't want to say anything about the final act, but I didn't find it as fresh as the middle acts, although it still works in its own way.<br /><br />The extras on the second disk are pretty good and provide good background on the movie including how it was made.
B0002TT0NW|2.0|Despite coaxing some superior acting out of Daniel Radcliff (Harry), the new director's take on the series lacks consistency and charm. Every new director wants to make a change, but in this case the changes have amounted to stripping the richness from the movie and reducing it to a rather bleak (and simplistic) format.  There is almost no Hogwarts background, the acting from the other main characters is trite and sneering, and overall I was left wondering why on earth Warner Brothers chose Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n to direct the movie. Change for the sake of it is pointless.  The new Dumbledore seems to have decided to stress the first four letters of his name, and the stock villain Draco Malfoy has transformed here into a stupid leering simpleton. The result is that there's no dramatic tension of any kind.  Although everyone seems to have raved about the results, this reviewer found it flat, badly-paced, lacking in charm and frankly not worth seeing a second time.  Bring back Chris Columbus!
0553213105|5.0|Overall, the writing and the plot were terrific although, at first, the haughtiness of certain characters like Lady Catherine really bothered me. (People like that deserve to be thrown into boot camps.) I was engrossed with the relationship between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy and how it played out from beginning to end. The conclusion of the story was satisfying and appropriate. All in all, this book is highly recommended.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|SHAWN OF THE DEAD is excellent dark humor !<br /><br />It pays excellent homage to Romero's flicks.<br /><br />Oddly enough, although this is a comedy (or spoof) of Zombie films they actually do better job creating an atmosphere of doom and have better looking/acting Zombie scenes than most of the recent \\"serious\\" Zombie films out there.<br /><br />I almost wish while they had the crew together making this film, they made 2 movies... one being Shawn of the Dead and the other being a serious horror Zombie film with the same scenes, make-up, acting. etc...
B0000AXE8I|4.0|\\"We can never see past a choice we don't understand\\".  <br /> <br />And Morpheus old buddy, there's no way we can see past a plot point we don't understand either. In fact, the first of two sequels to the smash film \\"The Matrix\\" is littered with so much gobbledygook, and an abundance of confusing plot subterfuge - that I dare anyone to decode it within one viewing.  <br /> <br />\\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" - not unlike its predecessor - might be hard to swallow but it's so delicious you just can't help but want more. Not unlike one of those gobstoppers you can find in any candy store - Hard to chew, nice to endure, if you will.  <br /> <br />A spectacle for the ears and eyes, \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" is the sequel fans of the first one have been craving for. The action sequences are bigger and better, the effects are eye-popping, and the story - apart from being mind-boggling - stays one step ahead of its audience at all times. But it's that story that also deters enjoyment there in a couple of spots. There's a little too much partisan speeches and drawn out mockery and while there's nothing wrong with exposition scenes, unfortunately some of these moments deter from the action sequences, which are significantly more entertaining than the plot. On first viewing, the plot seems to be all over the place. Large helpings of waffle sprinkled throughout the film. Those who've seen the first film a few dozen times might find it a bit easier to understand than those who haven't - but all in all there's a little \\"too much\\" here. Maybe it makes sense, maybe it doesn't - that'll have to be decided upon repeated viewings.  <br /> <br />But as an action extravaganza, The Wachowski's have matched the spectacle of - if not bettered - that of the original. A lengthy battle-scene taking place on a tiring freeway is one of the film's grand highlights and scenes where Neo is soaring through the skies like the Man of Steel are awe-inspiring [If Warner can re-create something like this for \\"Superman\\", maybe the remake will be worth the wait].  <br /> <br />Some will have a problem with it, some just won't understand it, but for most, the only disappointment will be the all too annoying \\"To be Concluded\\" tag, that's stamped on the final frame.  <br />
B0001AVZA8|4.0|Overall, I did feel entertained, and was glad I stayed through the credits so I could hear Jack sing. Has he ever done that before in a film? But no way did I believe a young woman in her twenties would go out with Jack Nicholson's character because of his personality. Date him because of his fame and wealth, sure, but I'm over forty, and he's too old and jaded for me! In this story, he's a leering louse with women all his life, yet the viewer is required to believe he will change at age 63. And that he will be attractive to the mother of the young woman he has wooed -- when the mother is probably a decade younger than heart attack-prone Jack. Once I suspended disbelief as required by the plot, I did enjoy the ride that this movie took me on. The dialog was good, some of the lines were witty or so true that they brought a wry smile. Diane Keaton is charming and still very attactive as a woman and actor so it was fun to see her onscreen and root for her to be happy. (Loved the scene where she checks Jack's blood pressure.) Jack's comic timing was very good (loved his reaction when he hears about the hazards of taking Viagra, and when he has to tinkle in the hospital). All the supporting characters are fine. The music and scenery are lovely.  I confess that -- for the first time --I found Keanu Reeves romantically appealing. I think that if such a handsome doctor strongly pursued an older woman in real life, she'd likely do just what Mary Tyler Moore did: marry him! He also was just a nicer person than Jack from the beginning of the story. So it was hard for me to accept Diane dumping Keanu for Jack.  As far as I was concerned, the movie should have ended bravely with Jack crying. But the tacked-on Hollywood ending  must have tested better.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|This film is never disappointing. It allows you to immerse yourself in a simpler time when magic still seems like a possibility. <br /> <br />And clearly I was not the only one impressed by this movie. It was nominated for a staggering 13 Academy Awards in 1965 and proceeded to win 5 including: Julie Andrews for Best Actress in a Leading Role; Peter Ellenshaw, Hamilton Luske and Eustace Lucett for Best Effects, Special Visual Effects, Cotton Warburton for Best Film Editing, and Richard B. Sherman and  Robert B. Sherman for Best Music, Score - Substantially Original, as well as Best Music, Song. It also won a number of other awards including Golden Globes, Grammys and BAFTAs. Dick Van Dyke, who unfortunately didn't receive an Academy Award nomination, was nominated for the Best Actor award in the Golden Globes, but was unsuccessful.  <br /> <br />Julie Andrews is Mary Poppins who, by unusual circumstances and highly original transportation, arrives at 17 Cherry Tree Lane to take up the role as nanny to Jane (Karin Dotrice) and Michael (Matthew Garber) who are the children of banker George Banks (David Tomlinson) and his suffragette wife Winifred (Glynis Johns). Mary Poppins, together with her friend Bert (Dick Van Dyke), a local street musician and chimney sweep, proceeds to take the children through a magical journey. Along the way she teaches George something about his values, and what the truly important things in his life are. <br /> <br />Mary Poppins showcases excellent performance by all the leading players, and is a classic movie by any standard.  <br /> <br />
B00009V7P8|5.0|This album is dangerous. I have bought O after listening to \\"Delicate\\", sent me by a special person. It was amazing. The same way that girl was. Then I heard \\"The blower's Daughter\\" and thought this guy had lots of things to tell. His songs can embrace your soul. Can't stop listening to them. Merry Xmas World!
B00000K31Q|4.0|This is the story of the Stratford sisters (nice in-joke that one), Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) and Katerina (Julia Stiles). Bianca is the babe of Padua High, the heart's desire of all hormonally-charged young guys there. Elder sister Kat, is not. Now it just so happens that the rules of the Stratford household are that Bianca can get to date when Kat goes on a date. Since Kat is, by choice, date-challenged, Bianca is frustrated, as are her new French tutor Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and model/hunk Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan), both desirous of the attentions of Bianca. So Cameron and new Padua High nerdy mate Michael Eckman (David Krumholtz) hatch a little plan to get Kat a date with anyone and score a date with Bianca for Cameron. The plan involves the money-enhanced Joey Donner (who naturally thinks he is to be the recipient of the date with Bianca) paying one Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) to date Kat. As you can imagine, a tangled web is created, especially when Patrick actually falls for Kat, Cameron realizes that Bianca wants Joey, and Bianca realizes that she cannot stand Joey and wants Cameron.   This is the sort of tangled web of a story that only a hack like Shakespeare can actually carry off with ease, and this version of the tale has certainly been updated well. The story has been well brought to life by a cast of essentially up-and-comers, with some nice enough performances on offer. I would like to say that Heath Ledger was one of the notable performances, but here he is somewhat overshadowed by Julia Stiles in my view. In general, the consistency of the cast is the main asset here rather than any being especially stellar. The direction is not much more than a typical by-the-numbers effort by a rent-a-director type that seems to be the norm for the Disney conglomerate.   10 Things I Hate About You is a better-than-expected film that I actually quite enjoy. It demonstrates the continued relevance of William Shakespeare in modern day life, and is a most worthwhile effort.
B0002Y69NG|4.0|i like the movie, but not much since it's quite confusing.  therefore it's 4 stars.    one q though, i already own the separate release of matrix (matrix, reloaded, revolutions) and i am only interested in the movies, not the extra material/features.  i notice that in this box set, there are lots of extra features. in this box set, are all the movies (matrix, reloaded, revolutions) the same as the separate previous release one? or they have some extra minutes (NOT extra material/bonus features, i hope i do not confuse people here) or not (sort of like lord of the ring extended version vs theatrical version)?  if the movies do have extra minutes (extended version from the previous release), then it's worth to buy.  otherwise, i m happy with my movies as i m interested in the movies, not extra features/material    if some matrix fanatics can answer this q, i'll really appreciate it.  thanks
B000004286|5.0|I've had this cd for about a week now, and ive already listened to it many many times. This is great music and is highly recommended. If you love to listen to instrumental music, as i do, then i suggest that you look into buying this cd. James Horner did a magnificent job.
B000068G9X|3.0|I am not realy a big punk fan and when I heard Misfits ex. lead singer Glen Danzig now had his own metal band,i had to check them out! Glen Danzig has one of the greatest singing voices ever. Similar to Elvis but better than elvis! The 1st track \\"twist of cain\\" was a realy catchy kind of dark Hard rock,straight up heavy metal song! I prayed that the rest of the album would be this good and for the most part it wasn't. I was very disapointed,if there were more (non mediocre)non crappy songs,than this would be one of my alltime favorite albums! Danzig is a great band and I hope that their other albums are better! This album made me think of danzig as the (AC/DC) of heavy metal. Ac/dc relaeses mediocre and sometimes terribal albums with one or two maybe 3 great songs on them and ther rest of the songs are utter crap. That is what this album was. Althought it wasn't all to bad,\\"Mother\\" is a great song that makes me want to give this album more than just 2 stars! And some other songs here are okay once you get used to them. Hopefully there other albums are better.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|Im writing reviews in search of broadening my musical horizons so to speak. its time to ditch the blink and killswitch and move on to the wide world of music. I grew up in Washington so i do love the alternative music. I hope i don't end up in the same category either. <br /> <br />to a casual music fan this double disk might seem a little unnecessary. why release b-sides when they didnt know there was enough 'a-sides'? is sony finally cashing in on the band after their last record:Vitalogy? ofcourse this is not true. Lost Dogs is bits and pieces of the band's finer work from 1990-2004. to their devoted fans the band is more alive than ever (no pun intended). This double disc is ear candy for long time devoted fans. although a lot of them have already heard bootleg and not so good versions of most of them. this album does nothing to make any singles for new audiences. not that pearl jam have ever tried to please anyone. the songs themselves are very uniqe. some of them dont even try to make meaningful points (hitchhiker, gremmie out of control, black, red, yellow), some are as experimental as ever (education, in the moonlight, otherside), some so personal that you wonder why it is there at all (4/20/04, footsteps), some stripped down to the bands essence(undone, strangest tribe), and there are those that just didnt make the cut so to speak (alone, down). whatever the case this is a perfect cd for fans who still pursue every fascet of the band. actually this album is so deep and far ranging that the collection of b-sides have singles. \\"Sad\\" and \\"Fatal\\" both seem to be the singles from this record. the many changes of the band are still here, \\"hold on\\" epitomizes their early years; heavily distorted slow paced, \\"all night\\" faster pace with no distortion but still rocking, \\"down\\" is the last phase the band was in where everything musically mixes not really inhibited by anything. i would recommend this album to anybody because there is something for everybody. \\"in the moonlight\\" is matt cameron's drumming genious in one song, \\"dead man\\" is said to be the best lyrically ed has ever gotten, and it is filled with some of the other band members projects.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Plain and simply, this is the most boring movie anyone will ever watch this year. I am a huge fan of indie films and find them much more entertaining than the big blockbuster dramas and crappy comedies with juvenile humour in them, but this one just plain--excuse the blunt word--sucked. The main character will make you want to kill him in the most gruesome of ways because he is not only a complete and utter loser, but he is also a complete jerk who is negative all the time. It was truly painful to watch this film because I was getting depressed at how stupid this character could be. The uncle sounds like a pedophile at all times, and the mexican kid (though orignal idea) sounds like he's drugged up on way too many sedatives. This is the biggest letdown for me in cinema history and i find that my friends get annoyed with me after i tell them how bad i thought this film was. Trash. absolute trash. don't buy it, don't rent it, hell dont even see it for free.
B00007LTIB|5.0|This classic had already been remastered on the Atlantic label a few years back. Now, we are treated to yet another series of Yes remasters: this time for the Rhino label. My suspicions on the motives behind this second series of Yes remasters aside, this classic remaster features a couple of single edits, and a studio run through. These are not very essential in my book, especially for people who love the album exactly as it is, but it's welcome, nonetheless.<br /><br />Intense, harsh, ethereal, voluminous and ruggedly symphonic, Yes' 1974 release, _Relayer_ is arguably their most dark, experimental, grandiose and aggressive. 1972's _Close To The Edge_ was positive, peaceful and reflective. 1973's _Tales From Topographic Oceans_ was spiritually (and/or religiously) deep. However, on _Relayer_, Yes gets bleak, harsh and ominous--attributes that are rare in the positive, hopeful, celestial and peaceful world of Yes. But, make no mistake, the cosmic factor is in droves on this album, and is one non-stop sonic adventure.<br /><br />The 22-minute war tale known as \\"The Gates Of Delirium\\", is a gargantuan slice of mystical progressive rock. In atmosphere, this epic features screaming synths, manic guitar solos and overall explosive volatility. Steve Howe's claustrophobic, finger-itching and hasty-paced guitar solos qualify him as nothing less than a virtuoso. Jon Anderson's vocals are ethereal, heartfelt and moving. Some of the rhythms played by Alan White are quite tricky, and not to be taken lightly. Later, Steve Howe and Chris Squire (bass) play something of an ascending scale before the violent, stormy and powerful instrumental middle section takes off. This is followed by the achingly beautiful \\"Soon, oh soon\\" section. The sad and poignant synthesizer backdrops provided by Patrick Moraz, set the stage for Jon Anderson's most poignant, ethereal and shiver-sending performance. His very last sung line (The sun will lead us, our reason to be here) makes my soul cry. After that, the epic sadly fades into oblivion.<br /><br />\\"Sound Chaser\\" is a manic, frenzied and aggressive jazz-fusion number, which features enough technical mastery to give classic King Crimson a run for their money. Alan White's drumming is ultra-technical and violent. He plays as if there were no tomorrow. Steve Howe's guitar parts are fluid and virtuosic. The middle section features an extended guitar solo. Steve also seems to slip a portion of \\"Mood For A Day\\" (off of _Fragile_) on here as well. Chris Squire's snaky basslines sandwiched in the crazed mix are something to behold as well.<br /><br />\\"To Be Over\\" is the mellow closer of the album. It features country-esque soundscapes (courtesy of Steve Howe's pedal steel), an instrumental section featuring many eerie sounds seeping from Patrick Moraz's keyboards, and a finale of chant-like vocal harmonies.<br /><br />_Relayer_ is Yes hitting on all cylinders: Violence, intensity, aggression, gloom, despair, ethereality, love, hope (and maybe triumph). The complexity here may take some getting used to. But, in the end, _Relayer_ is a trip worth taking.After that, the epic sadly fades into oblivion. <br /> <br />\\"Sound Chaser\\" is a manic, frenzied and aggressive jazz-fusion number, which features enough technical mastery to give classic King Crimson a run for their money.

B0000457AW|5.0|1971's _Islands_ is quite the subject of mixed opinions among King Crimson fans. Many probably were not ready for something on the more subdued side (at least for King Crimson.)<br /><br />'Boz', lead vocalist and bassist for this album only, admitted in an interview from a Bad Company profile (the band he would join after leaving Crimson) that he disliked the material he helped to create on this album. I couldn't disagree more. While I do enjoy this album, I must admit that I do not pull it out very often.<br /><br />The music found on _Islands_ is not as aggressive as on albums like 1974's _Red_ or the 1969 debut. Instead, it's more reflective, subtle, ambient, esoteric, celestial, absorbing and meditative. It starts with \\"Formentera Lady,\\" which reminds me of early Moody Blues. It's mostly ambient-driven featuring flute, bass, sax and assorted percussion. \\"Sailor's Tale\\" seems to pick up where the previous track left off (the sax hints at the latter in the last few minutes of \\"Formentera Lady\\") which is a spellbindingly atmospheric and inventive jazz rock tune. \\"The Letters\\" spews forth dark and ambient soft guitar passages, followed by ominous and fiery jazz rock. \\"Ladies Of The Road\\" sounds like the boys were paying homage to The Beatles,  especially when listening to the vocal harmonies. However, the subject matter (sexual) is more Rolling Stones (not designated). \\"Song Of The Gulls\\" is an instrumental bridging new age and classical forms. Very heavenly instrumental. The title track is no different. Ethereal and soothing instrumentation combined with ethereal and soothing vocals makes this a perfect track to unwind to. Listen out for the closing of the song which features Robert Fripp and gang doing what sounds like rehearsing.<br /><br />_Islands_ is far too subtle and esoteric to be appreciated by everyone, including King Crimson fans. To take it a step further, it's not an album that will reveal it's strengths upon first listening. If subtle, atmospheric-ambient jazz, new age or classical (with rock added) is your cup of tea, this may be a wonderful pick. Give this album time and you may be rewarded with the transcendent and magical breeze of a wonderful _Island_.heric-ambient jazz, new age or classical (with rock added) is your cup of tea, this may be a wonderful pick.

B000002W8O|4.0|When Elvis' christmas recordings were reissued on CD, there was apparently some mixing and matching going on.  While I totally love this CD, it is not the same one I listened to that my mom had on LP when I was little.  It has several additions and omissions from that one, most notably the lack of \\"If Everyday Was Like Christmas\\".  That song can be found on a CD of the same title, but the track listing of another one called \\"It's Christmas Time\\" by Elvis looks more familiar as the one I liked as a kid.  Elvis' stuff is always great, though, so I still recommend this one, too.

B00005JMUL|4.0|\\"A grave and disappointing failure, as much of imagination as of technology.\\" - Manohla Dargis, New York Post <br /> <br />\\"There's only so much that digital information can convey about what makes a human being human.\\" - Ty Burr, Boston Globe <br /> <br />\\"There's a deeper, shivery tone, instead of the mindless jolliness of the usual Christmas movie.\\" - Rober Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times <br /> <br />\\"The first film in a long time to capture that ineffable whatever it is that people hope to find when they go to a Christmas movie.\\" - Mike LaSalle, San Francisco Chronicle <br /> <br />These reviews are a small fraction of the professional and occupational critical reaction, but they hint at the wide variety of ways to react to a film of this kind at this time (of the year). <br /> <br />At the risk of trivializing my own write-up, I've come to believe there may be as many perspectives from which to view a complex movie as there are persons in the country, or perhaps the world. But that does not mean we cannot bring focus or clarity to certain elements within one. <br /> <br />At any rate, to build on Ebert's thought above - whatever else may be said - it seems clear that Robert Zemeckis' holiday film THE POLAR EXPRESS is the most unique Christmastime picture to come around in quite a while. <br /> <br />For the record, none of the main characters have real names: they are known, respectively, as Boy, Girl, Conductor, Know-It-All, and Loner. <br /> <br />The film opens to show us Boy going to bed on Christmas Eve, appropriately minimally narrated by his older and (we must assume) grown-up voice (Tom Hank's). Having 'looked up' the North Pole before finally retiring, his attention is drawn to a loud noise and a bright light outside his bedroom window. Boy goes outside ... to see a train appear behind all the steam. The Conductor welcomes him aboard for a northerly journey that is destined to become a magical night to cherish and remember. <br /> <br />As one might expect from its title, the film revolves (always in some way or other) around Santa, alas, without reference to a newborn Messiah. As Plugged-In's review has suggested, occasional danger might scare young tots; a PG rating seems more appropriate. That said, I did enjoy the train attendants' dancing routine, somewhat reminiscent of a Disney musical. I was amused to see Girl's ticket escape Boy's hand and the train, float through the air, get knocked around by various forces of nature, and land again, wherever that was. I liked that it contained peril, and Steamey and Smokey's desperate attempts to save the train from it (not to mention their other oddities). Also, that `Hobo' guy is never explained adds to the mystery the movie tries to convey. And the CGI animation looks good (though some critics have complained). <br /> <br />I must confess that I have not read the 1965 book on which the film is based, so I am unequipped to make comparisons to it. <br /> <br />As for the film, bits of the critical response themselves need critique. Burr, of the Globe, seems disappointed by the movie's `human' element. Sure, the animation technology used did not bring every facial detail to life, but for what was used, it is not that bad. I thought the overall portrayals (facial expressions notwithstanding) appeared to be firmly human. Also, Dargis, of the N.Y. Post, is surely wrong to say that Boy 'dreamed up' the train, as we see him pinch himself while en route, not to mention [SPOILER WARNING! rest of paragraph] a Santa-given souvenir that makes its way to the very end of the movie (literally) the morning after. The film closes us with Boy and his 'awe' or 'wonder' about Santa and the spirit of Christmas ... and the thought (despite presentable illogic) that childlike faith in Santa is in some sense real. <br /> <br />For what I had expected, THE POLAR EXPRESS did not disappoint. A fine product.
B000069KGM|5.0|This is the debut of, in my opinion, the greatest band in the world. Chicago's sound is unique. Their harmonies, the horn arrangements, and their unique blend of jazz and rock and roll, make Chicago one of the greatest rock bands of all time! <br /> <br />Many of the members of Chicago started out playing in jazz bands as teenagers, and it's easy to hear those influences. The band officially got together in 1967, spent 68 recording, and by 1969 they had this album out. <br /> <br />What a nice introduction to the greatest band in the world. This album has something for everyone. <br />                               <br />You want jazz? You got it! The band swings in 3/4 and 5/4, demonstrated in songs, Introduction, and Does Anybody Know What Time It Is. Robert Lamm delivers a nice jazz piano intro on, Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is. I heard the solo being compared to Art Tatum! (Not bad for a rock and roll band kid!) <br /> <br />You want rock? You got it! Two songs are of the essence here. South Carolina Purples, and I'm A Man. South Carolina Purples is untouchable. If any other band today, tried to cover it, they would fall on their faces while trying. Nice \\"fuzz\\" guitar delivered by Terry Kath. Dont forget, I'm A Man. Perhaps the most rockin song on the album. There is a little R&B influence in thie song. It's too bad this is one of the few covers the band did, but I'm sure Chicago's version of I'm A Man can beat whoever did it first, no problem! Drummer, Danny Seraphine gives us some fire on the traps in this tune! <br /> <br />You want progressive? You got it. Just give a little, Free Form Guitar a chance, courtesy of Terry Kath. This is without a doubt ahead of its time. Nowadays, you got all sorts of experimentation on guitars, but back then, it was a rarity, and to this day, it is more revolutionary than any guitar experimentation that I have ever heard! Also listen to the horn arrangements on Introduction. It will knock the hair out of your head.<br /> <br />They always say, a groups first album is the best! However true that may be, it curtainly fits with this group. This is one extraudinary album!  <br /> <br />I'll listen to it again, and again, and never get tired of it. This album is the rock equivelent of Vince Guaraldi's Jazz Impressions of the Black Orpheus, in the fact that I  played both albums non stop, for about a month after I bought them. Get this album. It makes any rock collection complete! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000687M48|5.0|If you saw Evanescence on tour in 2004 then \\"Anywhere But Home\\" will preserve your concert memories.  The song lineup was essentially the same (they opened with \\"Going Under\\" when I heard them) and I had the same reaction when Amy Lee lets the audience sing the first chorus on \\"My Immortal\\" that I did in St. Cloud, which was SHUT UP AND LET THE WOMAN SING THE SONG! I CAME HERE TO HEAR HER DO THIS SONG NOT YOUR PEOPLE!  But despite their insistence on signing along when her voice soars on the bridge it still gives me chills.<br /><br />Basically what you have here in \\"Fallen\\" live, which makes sense simply because this is one of the best selling albums of this century.  Those who went directly from \\"Fallen\\" to \\"Anywhere But Home\\" without seeing Evanescence in concert will be surprised because live the group is a lot more Goth than they sounded on the album.  To Evanescence's legion of fans this is not news, but I know full well that a lot of people will pick up this album expecting more songs like the piano ballad \\"My Immortal\\" when \\"Bring Me to Life\\" is more emblematic of the group's sound.<br /><br />Whoever edited the concert film obviously thinks we have the attention span of fruit flies, because there is constant cutting from one shot to the next as well too many shots of a camera moving over the audience with its raised fists and not enough watching the band play.  You get everything from camera shots taken from the back row of the place to a close up of a singer's mouth.  Note to future musicians: if you get something tattooed on the back of your neck people with cameras will think that is your good side.  I guess if a director wants to get \\"arty\\" with all this concert footage<br /><br />It is strange that \\"Anywhere But Home\\" is seen as CD w/bonus DVD because I got it for the DVD.  The CD is nice in terms of being able to listen to it in the car, but I rarely think concert's CDs sound as good as the video/DVD.  Besides, I still have \\"Fallen\\" to listen to and my collection of Evanescence accoustic tracks.  However, I totally appreciate having the two in one package, because it gives you both options and if everybody did this with concerts it would be a far better world.<br /><br />The fourteen songs are the same on the CD and DVD (or DVD and CD) with the DVD including the group's four music videoes: \\"My Immortal,\\" \\"Everybody's Fool,\\" \\"Bring Me to Life,\\" and \\"Going Under.\\"  The behind the scenes stuff on the DVD is actually fun, because we all know Amy Lee can sing, but can she do cartwheels, play ping pong on roller skates, or get through a simply thank you to the fans at the Nordic Music Awards?  More importantly, will the Haunted Hotel Prank work on Terry and what insantity will previal on stage the last night of the tour?  Just take the words \\"Evanescene Unleashed\\" seriously because these kids are serious about having fun on tour.<br /><br />I know people are waiting for a second album from Evanescence and there is an impulse to castigate them for milking \\"Fallen\\" for all it is worth.  But given the heightened expectations and the new lineup for the band in terms of song writing, chances are that second album will be a big disappointment.  After all, debut albums allow to pick your best material from what is usually two or three albums worth of songs.  I can look at bands from Bad Company to Live where the first album were very good to absolutely great and the follow ups were never in the same neighborhood (but let me pull select tracks from the next three albums and I can be headed in that direction).  Still, even if the band breaks on the rocks of high expectations Amy Lee's voice is just too good to be sunk by anything short of a massive rock diva meltdowns.<br /><br />The Easter Egg on this one is the performance of \\"Bring Me to Life\\" done in Las Vegas in the neon sign junkyard for the Grammy Awards.  To get to it on the main menu go down to \\"Behind the Scenes\\" and then click your left arrow button twice.  The Evanescene \\"E\\" symbol lights up in yellow and then you can hit \\"Enter.\\"tton twice.  The Evanescene \\"E\\" symbol lights up in yellow and then you can hit \\"Enter.\\"

B0006A9FKA|5.0|Hearing that \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" is the most popular British zombie comedy of all time does give one pause, simply because you have to stop for a second and wonder as to whether you have simply missed other British zombie comedies or if you maybe took \\"28 Day Later\\" way too seriously.  The thing is that when you hear \\"British zombie comedy\\" you are thinking \\"Monty Python's Flying Circus\\" or \\"Benny Hill\\" or \\"Black Adder\\" or \\"Asbolutely Fabulous\\" or \\"Coupling.\\"  You are not thinking something that is as restrained as what Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright have put together (the pair co-wrote the film, Pegg stars as Shaun and Wright directs), which is probably the biggest surprise of all.<br /><br />\\"Shaun of the Dead\\" is only four star funny, so we are not even close to \\"Airplane!\\" territory, which is still the funniest film of all time (measured in number of laughs generated) but there is another dimension to the film beyond the humor.  The tagline tries to tells us that this movie is: \\"A romantic comedy. With zombies.\\"  The really funny thing is that, underneath it all, it really is a romantic comedy.  You know: boy meets girl, girl dumps boy, zombies try to kill boy and girl and mom and flat mates, boy tries to rescue girl and mom and flat mates, so on and so forth.<br /><br />Actually the movie that that came to mind the most, despite the references to the great zombie movies of the past (\\"We're coming to get you, Barbara!\\"), was \\"Young Frankenstein,\\" specifically in terms of the scenes that are played totally straight.  There are scenes when Shaun deals with his girl, Liz (Kate Ashfield), his mom, Barbara (Penelope Wilton), and his best bud, Ed (Nick Frost) that are done like they were in a romantic comedy, and not an Adam Sandler \\"Water Boy\\" type romantic comedy, but an Adam Sandler \\"50 First Dates\\" type romantic comedy.  Stripped of the zombies this is a rather pedestrian romantic comedy, but what makes it inspired lunacy is that it IS being done in the middle of a zombie movie.<br /><br />There are two prime moments that reflect this rather amazing tightrope walking act.  One is when Shaun almost breaks and notes that there may be a limit as to how many people he loves that he can shoot in one day.  The other is when we have one of those \\"goodbye\\" scenes usually found in war movies; it is not just the silliness of the particular bit of business returning from the start of the movie, but that it is brought back at that particular moment, and that both actors honestly treat it as the most serious thing in the world.  Tragedy is hard, but comedy is harder, and then there is treating tragedy as comedy in the middle of a zombie movie.  Watching this movie is like watching somebody take a stupid shot in a basketball game and you start saying, \\"No, no, no, no, no...\\" until the ball rips through the nets and then you smile and say \\"Great shot!\\"<br /><br />The other great bit of fun is how \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" plays with the genre movies.  The opening of the film throws every clich&eacute; moment of being suddenly surprised by zombies in the history of the cinema at Shaun, only to have everything be normal.  So you know they will take a totally different tack when it comes to Shaun realizing he has missed the dawn of the dead.  The bit you have seen in the preview about arguing over which LPs to use as weapons to fight the living dead is cute, but the comic masterpiece in this film is Shaun channel surfing.  Every single channel is talking about what is happening, but Shaun is clicking so rapidly that he misses getting a complete picture.  Note: always listen to what is on the telly in the background: that is where the best \\"28 Days Later\\" joke in the film comes (All of the talking heads are actually British television news talking heads, so translate that into Brokaw, Jennings, and Rather doing the same thing for an American movie; see the \\"TV BITS\\" in the DVD extras).<br /><br />The more you know about zombie movies the more you willenjoy \\"Shaun of the Dead,\\" because you will be able to pick up on all the specific references.  But then I have never seen \\"Spaced,\\" so all of the homages to that British situation comedy involving Pegg, Frost and Wright are lost on me and I am doing okay at the moment.  Either way, I think the humor of the film is accessible to even zombie movie neophytes, although the only way you might be able to talk them into seeing this one is to tell them their other choice is \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" (I do not have to tell anyone that is a rather obvious double bill).<br /><br />Of the DVD extras the extended bits and outtakes in \\"MISSING BITS\\" are okay, but by favorite are the trio of \\"Plot Holes,\\" where we get some insights into what we did not see in the movie from three of the principle characters.  These are presented in comic book form as opposed to having actual footage, but that simply adds to their charm.  There are better bits in \\"RAW MEAT,\\" the highlight of which is the \\"pitch\\" by Pegg and Wright to sell the studio their movie idea.

0141301155|3.0|Dahl's delightful story about the lucky children who found five Golden Tickets has captured the imagination of kids of all ages since 1964. Charlie Bucket is a thin only-child who lives in poverty with his adoring parents and 4 old grandparents.  It's bad enough to be nearly starving all the time, but he has to pass by Willy Wonka's world-famous chocolate factory to and from school every day!  Suddenly the nation is swept by Wonka- mania; a newspaper announcement creates a buying frenzy to find the five-only special invitations for a private tour inside the mysterious locked gates. The prize also includes a lifetime supply of candy! If anyone deserves to be included, it is surely our Charlie. <br /> <br />     Curious little Willy Wonka has many marvels to share and his own unique method of child therapy, which he subtly works on the four other (bratty) children who are also ticket holders.  Join Charlie and his beloved Grandpa Joe as they stare in amazement at the hidden wonders inside Mr. Wonka's fabulous chocolate factory.  Who are those tiny workers who produce the world's greatest candy?  How does Willy Wonka try to reform the spoiled kids and what incredible surprise does he have in store for the one decent kid in the bunch? Although different from the movie version, this book is the original Golden Literary Ticket to an unlimited feast of rich imagination! Not to mention a cautionary tale to children who indulge in various excesses. <br />
B0002XDODU|4.0|C'est très bon même vraiment, vraiment bon mais je m'attendais à quelque chose de mieux j'avais entendu des chansons d'autres CD comme &quot;Du hast&quot; et je m'attendais a quelque chose de semblable.<br />Finalement j'aime toutes les chansons sauf 3 (les 3 dernières) et c'est pour ca que je donne 4/5
B000244EMO|5.0|My god this movie rocks.  It starts off with Arnold and these ultra tough guys(A red neck, a indian, a black guy, and a nerd)going into the jungle to kill some commie scum.  On their way to battle they find some dead Americans skinned in a tree.  Apparently commies skin their kills and hang them in trees so they continue on to find em.  After a while they find the commie base.  Arnold, being tough as nails blows up a bunch of stuff and rushes in and kills like half the guys in the camp.  His team helps with the rest and they find this chick and take her prisoner.  On the way back to the rendezvous point the commie chick tries to escape but then the nerdy guy catches her....and then he gets his guts blown out and gets drug into the forest by some strange invisible thing.  The rest of the gang finds her and she says in commie speak that some demon came outa the forest.  That demon is the friggin predator.  He is amazing.  He will rock you.  He ends up killing everyone except Arnold and the chick(woman aren't a challenge).  The only reason while Arnold doesn't die is because he's the main character and the USA likes happy endings.  This movie is way more believable than AVP and Predator 2....but those movies are still pretty great.  This is one of the best action movies ever.  I traveled to the dominican republic just to have my DVD of The Predator blessed by a voodoo shaman.
B00064AM6C|5.0|I just purchased this dvd and i can't stop watching it.  Favorites include \\"Hotel Yorba\\" because the performance has a real feel good vibe and \\"Death Letter\\" which i have yet to see a bad live performance of.  Jack White's playing is insane as always and Meg's drumming is quite impressive considering how she has to keep up with Jack's improv-heavy guitar work.  Pick this up and see what all the fuss is about.
B00008S2VG|1.0|This album reeks of desperation. How can anyone find this person attractive?...gross. A German Shepard is better looking than her. What with the fake accent, the lip synching, the honor of being voted the worst pop singer actress ever, and the audacity of still thinking she's young and hip, makes one want to cringe. Oh help.
B000002LND|5.0|I don't know how many times I've played The Immaculate Collection from Madonna.  It is consistent all the way through with the dance numbers and pop ballads.  I still love Lucky Star just as much as Holiday.  I liked that they put the ALBUM VERSION of Live to Tell on this album, not that single version.  The Q-sound that was so popular on albums in 1990 made this album more exciting to listen to with the sound boucing back and forth in your ears.  Sort of like composer Morton Subotnick in his time.  I still find it hard to believe that Holiday peaked at No. 16 in early 1984, yet her later singles went on to No. 1 or top 5.  She's had a very impressive 45 to 50 top 40 hits since 1983, just coming up with hot songs every time! I can tell her growth in the '84,'85 and '86 songs and how she got more personal on '89's Like A Prayer.  Vogue still pumps hard in its groove. Don't like Justify My Love, but I like the soulful Rescue Me.  She sings with so much grit in Rescue, unlike anything I've heard from her. Her wanting material things in Material Girl, her sexiness in Like A Virgin, her Spanish turn in La Isla Bonita, her '60s sounding feel in Cherish, the 50s feel in True Blue, the dance heavy glittery feel in Lucky Star and many more highlights are what make this album so entertaining with each listen! She is a master at making unique songs and reinventing her look and sound for each album.
B00003CXAA|5.0|THE GODFATHER is without question the greatest American film of all time.  THE GODFATHER trilogy is without comparrison, although GODFATHER PART III, gets 5 stars only by default.  The most interesting of the three films remains GODFATHER PART II, boasting the best ending of any American film ever (Bogart walking off into the fog in CASABLANCA notwithstanding).  The reason:  Same as GF I, the characters.  GF II's most interesting being Frank Pantangeli (Michael V. Gazzo, in an Oscar nominated performance)the old school cosa nostra caught in a world of hurt by changing times.  There's no respect for the old ways (the families negotiating instead of going to war)or traditions (Italian musicians who can't play the tarantela, WASP-ish food at a Corleone event).  This charactrer is fascinating, eclipsing Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg also nominated for Best Supporting Actor)and all of the Corleone clan, including Robert DeNiro's Oscar winning performance as Young Vito Corleone...asking the filmdom question:  Was it the performance or the role itself that was Oscar caliber, considering Brando won for his iconistic work in GF (1972). What would have been perfect, in addition to this set, was FFC cutting all three films, with the deleted scenes, just as he did in THE GODFATHER, THE COMPLETE NOVEL FOR TV, and in the 1990 VHS package.  Call the marketing department.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I think that it is timely that they put out Shania Twain's Greatest Hits album just in time for Christmas.  Sure she's done only four albums, but she's had multiple hits out of albums 2, 3 and 4. Twain has a knack out of doing country songs that have a mainstream feel to them.  They are undeniably catchy and addictive, yet have that melodic edge to them.  I like that she put the remix of That Don't Impress Me Much on here, which has that funky dance beat!  I thought that P. Diddy remixed it because of its somewhat hip-hop feel in it.  Any Man of Mine, Man I Feel Like A Woman, I'm Gonna Get You Good, Up, Party For Two and others are solid rockers.  The sentimental From This Moment On and You're Still the One (a popular wedding song favorite) are still playing on adult contemporary stations. WRAL, Mix 101.5 in Raleigh, NC was playing You're Still the One like crazy the week of this greatest hits' album release. That staff loves that song. Twain has had a good string of hits that get away from the typical assembly-line formula of Nashville. Robert Mutt Lange proved that he could do strong in country after all those '80s powerhouse hits for Def Leppard, Bryan Adams, AC/DC and others. Shania Twain is a dynamic performer and artist, and this album proves that.
B00005JMAH|1.0|The book is so much more well put together then the movie. The movie is choppy at best.  I'm a big fan of the harry potter books but the movies have frankly dispointed me. It leaves out key elements of the story and changes the plot around. It was confusing and harder to follow then the book. I really think people should just stick to the book or the books on tape because they are awesome. If i could give this movie a 0 I would! I wanted to just fall asleep during it. This is a sell out at best!
B0002DB52M|5.0|Paul Bettany was excellent, but Nicole Kidman gave a superb performance- much better than \\"The Hours\\".  Kidman was spectacular as \\"Grace\\".  The movie was excellent. And Ms. Kidman never looked more beautiful since \\"Moulin Rouge\\".  Her face was so expressive, her eyes and forehead so full of emotion portraying her character.   <br />The movie has a wonderful story to tell if people can get past the set and chalk outlines.  I felt myself conscious of it only for the first 15 minutes or so.  After that, I became so enthralled with the tale I was riveted.  By the last few scenes I was demanding complete silence in the house so that we did not miss even one word of the dialogue.  <br />The ending was spellbinding and I loved the chalk outline at the end transforming into the dog. <br />
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Great movie with many neat twists. Definately a movie worth watching over and over again. Everytime you watch it you will discover something that you hadn't noticed the previous times. Funny but sad movie..
B00008MZ0N|4.0|From probably the only female reviewing this movie, and a female who can't stand action flicks... if Vin tickles your senses, you'll dig this movie.  Sure the cars are fun, it's loaded with testosterone, and you are glad that justice is served against the 'bad guys' in the end, but most important: It serves up plenty of eye candy.  There is one (too brief) scene between Vin and his gal that offers enough to keep your own imagination going for awhile.  Plot?  Is there EVER REALLY a GOOD plot in an action movie?  Do we really care about the fact that we never get back to Road Wars or whether someone is racing with a laptop on the passenger seat?  We're not looking for reality- and I think I speak for both the boys and girls on this one.  Really now... please.  (And girls, if you are looking for more Vin, check out XXX.)
B00008S2VF|1.0|Starting from the cover art, you can see it's awful, and poor.Now let's talk about the music.There are just very few nice songs on the album, like \\"X-Static Process\\" and \\"Nothing fails\\".Both of these songs have nice and deep lyrics, joined by good string arrangements.\\"I'm so stupid\\", \\"Nobody knows Me\\" or even the main single \\"American Life\\" are a clear show of her few real talent. Most of the songs are repetitive, boring and absolutely stupid.If she thought that turning against the nation that has fed her, would be a hit, she was wrooooong.Madonna's succesful days must be over, now she has to kiss other singers to get a little bit of attention, 'cause other way she would fail. <br />Bad album. Madonna's good works ended with \\"Music\\" <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JN2Z|4.0|COLLATERAL, director Michael Mann's most recent film, is not only a nail-bitingly tense thriller (especially in its final half hour), but also a fascinating study of two characters, contract killer Vincent (Tom Cruise) and cabbie Max (Jamie Foxx), who, as screenwriter Stuart Beattie subtly and slyly reveals, had grander ambitions as younger men but have had to settle for something much less. Max, especially, has dreams of eventually owning his own limo service and striking it rich---but he's been dreaming about that for the twelve years he's been driving a cab.     I enjoyed this film a lot, but I will concede that I probably liked it more for its ambition than for its execution. To be hypercritical, for example, I suppose that in the end this human angle to the characters---the conversations Vincent and Max have while the latter is taken hostage by the former take on existentialist, \\"what-is-our-purpose-in-life\\" tones, though never as pretentious or preachy as it may sound---doesn't really lead anywhere, that they're all just little details to add spice to what is otherwise a rather standard thriller. The moody final shots of the film, for me, don't sum up any of the character themes Mann throws into the picture, as fraught with meaning as they outwardly seem.     Still, better to have involving human characters that spout convincing dialogue rather than just another high-tech thriller with loud shootouts and bombastic chase scenes to cover for a neglect for the human factor. And it helps that the performances are, for the most part, quite effective. In the case of Jamie Foxx, it is much more than that. His touching performance as Max truly brings sympathy to his character, who is not only Vincent's victim but perhaps a victim of his own delusions of grandeur. (In a few small ways, I think Foxx's quiet, unassuming turn here might be slightly more memorable than his more outwardly impressive portrayal of Ray Charles in the recent RAY.) As for Tom Cruise, I was generally able to accept him as the steely bad guy Vincent, but a better actor might have brought more convincing menace and gravitas to the role. Still, Cruise pulls off this casting-against-type reasonably well...and besides, now that I think about it, perhaps COLLATERAL is more about Max than it is about Vincent. Who doesn't dream big against all reason once in a while? Max is who we relate to in this film, who we root for, who really involves us emotionally.     In short, COLLATERAL may not be a truly great film, but it is a good one that works as an effective suspense thriller and as a character study. These two sides may not totally mesh together to produce a convincing whole vision, but I would take this kind of ambitious, intelligent movie over a soulless Hollywood thriller \\"product\\" any day. Recommended.
0399230033|5.0|I got this book in a large lot of used board books on ebay.  At some point, my daughter found it, and we have been \\"reading\\" it every night before bed for a few months now (eternity in a 23 month-old's life...).  As other reviwers have said, this book is a very cleverly illustrated and un-wordy book.  Ms Rathmann manages to convey the weariness of the zookeeper, the cleverness of the gorilla, and the surprise of the wife with only pictures.  Every page is wonderfully illustrated with tiny details, which my daughter points out.  Each time we read it, she finds something new to comment on.  I can't recommend this book enough!
B00000J7J4|5.0|Rehearing this highly acclaimed, multiple-Grammy-winning album recently, I suddenly realized what the hype was about Carlos Santana. Other musicians who play guitar might show off their skills on the electric guitar via flashy high notes and runs and scales. Santana, on the other hand, electrifies in a different way: when he's at his best, he makes his instrument sing as powerfully as the human voice. For an example, go to \\"El Farol,\\" Track 11 on this disc: who knew an electric guitar could sound so low-key and mournful?    As the Editorial Review suggested above, it is the tracks with Santana's band alone that are the real highlights. (\\"Primavera\\" is a particular favorite of mine, but the rest, most of them more upbeat, are no less impressive.) The pop-star collaborations aren't too bad overall, but none of them really show Santana at his best in the way the other tracks do. Still, \\"Love of My Life\\" (which borrows the song-like main tune of the third movement of Brahms' Third Symphony), \\"Put Your Lights On\\", \\"Maria Maria,\\" and \\"Wishing It Was\\" are entertaining cuts (although it was the arguably overplayed \\"Smooth\\" that was the big hit). The album ends with Santana and Eric Clapton, two old guitar-playing legends, jamming together infectiously on \\"The Calling.\\" Perhaps Santana himself has found the calling for newfound modern-day success in this album. Certainly, he has elicited a calling in me to go explore some of the older albums of this great, legendary musician. If nothing else, SUPERNATURAL serves as a good introduction to Santana and his soulful brand of musicmaking. Recommended.
B0001Z53AQ|4.0|This CD is good and i think that D12 is a good combination of guys.   <br /> <br />2 Best- Git UP <br />        Loyalty
0385508417|3.0|This was the fifth John Grisham book I've read and easily my least favorite.  It's not that it's a lighthearted family story or anything like that.  One needs a good story like that every now and then.  Unfortunately, his writing style seems to be sub-standard on this one.  And the characters are not quite as believable or intriguing as in any of his other books I have read.<br /><br />My primary problem with this book is that the main characters - Luther and Nora Krank - did not seem to me to be skipping Christmas.  I think the only thing they were trying to skip was a huge commercial racket.  And it is virtually impossible in this day and age to celebrate Christmas without skipping the horrible racket.  I was especially encouraged by the following  statement made in chapter three:<br /><br />\\"It was entirely possible to enjoy Christmas without cards, without parties and dinners, without needless gifts, without a lot of things that for some reason had been piled onto the birth of Christ.\\"<br /><br />But the criticisms aside, this is an enjoyable book.  Even a slow reader (such as myself) could read it in one sitting if desired.  But if it's a Christmas commercialism laugh you're looking for, then I'd recommend the essays \\"Xmas and Christmas\\" and \\"What Christmas Means to Me\\".  They can both be found in the book GOD IN THE DOCK by C.S. Lewis.
B00003CXXP|2.0|For any mature adult or person, they can see no doubt that this movie has so many in depth and profound themes that are somewhat haunting and intriguing, and yet beautiful and a bit ambiguous at the same time. I give 5 stars for the originality and message of this film. The only problem is that it eventually goes from being...interesting...to... okay...to... is it over yet?..then to... C'MON, WE GET THE PICTURE, WHEN IS THIS STORY EVER GOING TO END! This movie is just too slow and too long. It eventually becomes quite a bore, and gets kind of silly, weird, and just pointless. This movie had so much potential, the conception of it is brilliant, and yet it comes off as being disappointing because 1) it's not complete, 2) it's not comprehensible all the way, and 3) eventually you lose interest in the movie all together. Too bad.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|This is possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen, right up there with \\"The Sweetest Thing\\".  I have an oddball sense of humor & enjoy a subtle comedy any day of the week.  Unfortunately this wasn't it.  There is no plot, you don't care for any of the characters, and even the music isn't that hot (except for the final credits).  I was looking forward to seeing this, but now I'm going to ask for my money back when I return the video.  Just because something is not mainstream or appeared at Sundance doesn't make it good.  Good writing & acting does that.  Don't waste your time.
B00005OAIE|4.0|John Mayer's succesful blend of pop, jazzy riffs, and some occasional funk or blues thrown in surely makes for an interesting listen. I just love his clean style, and by clean I mean he uses acoustic guitar in almost every song (strumming and fingerstyle), but when he does use electric as well in quite a few songs it's clean or lightly distorted. He doesn't need a cruching distortion to use the electric guitar well, and kudos to Mr. Mayer for that.
1400032717|5.0|This book must be the best book I have ever read.  Mark Haddon really gets into the mind of the autistic boy, Christopher, extremely well.  It seems as though he is talking to you.  All of Christopher's crazy intelligence (ie- all of the prime numbers up to 7,057 and all of the countries in the world and their capitals), his strange, OCD-like, \\"logical\\" schedule (4 red cars in a row that pass the bus on the way to school = a Good Day and 4 yellow cars = a Dark Day), and Mark Haddon's eccentric wording, add up to a fabulous read.
B000002N9L|4.0|I know this record catches a lot of heat from fans, but this album is not bad at all. There are some real gems here, and I think that fans sometimes don't take this album for what it really is, a thrown together record, that wasen't mean to be some big time commercial hit. You can't go into this album expecting a \\"Sign 'O' The Times\\", or a \\"Purple Rain\\", because you'll be dissapointed.  <br />Most of the tracks on here are rock, and Prince puts his guitar skills to use. The best songs on this album are \\"Right The Wrong\\", \\"I Like It There\\", and the title track. I suggest you buy this if you're a diehard fan and don't already have it.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Finally the world is waking up to that reality.  All the syncho-techno effects can't cover up the fact that the only thing Spears does well is tart up a stage.  I really liked her when she was a kid and could actually get away with having no vocal skills.  The terrific funk music and her dancing was entertaining.  But we all grew up while Britney didn't.  She thinks she can still get away with it even though the lack of a voice is evident.  Sad, really.  Too bad we actually have to give this chick one star.  They should allow us to give a minus 5!
B00009Y3R6|5.0|Watching this movie about three girls removed from their home and sent to a camp that would train them into the \\"white\\" society reminds me of a book written by a mixed-raced African who was sent to an orphanage for mixed children.  The girls I believe were colonialism's \\"accidents\\".  The children who were mixed were ostracized by both Aborigines and whites because of their dual heritage.  The school was supposed to \\"whiten\\" them, which not only meant that they were to be trained as domestics, but to be lightened to make the country more white.   <br />Colonialism and imperialism demoralized itself, trying to do right for the natives by forcibly imposing their culture on a people who already had a culture and a way of living.  The victims in the movie were the girls because of their racial makeup feared that they would be an imposed threat to society.  This movie I highly recommend for anyone of all backgrounds.
0780624890|5.0|I saw this movie yesterday on Christmas Eve, as far as the Blade series I think this movie is the best one in the series, the ratings and overviews from the critics are a fars, I do beleive that the critics dont know what the general public likes, it is there own view and they must live a very sheltered life, my hat of to Wesley Snipes on another great action flick.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|Although this CD contains many of the beatles earliest hits, it lacks their later more experimental/trippy works. Someone bought this for me as a gift and i returned it and bought Sgt. Peppers lonely Hearts Club Band. This album lacks the diversity that it should have, it definitely covers the early hits, but it doesn't have some of my favorites like, I am the walrus, Lucy in the sky with diamonds, Sgt. Pepper's lonely heart club band, Strawberry fields forever, etc. This album is for someone who has just started listening to the beatles and enjoys their more poppie years.
B00005JKEC|4.0|The Game is Chess not Checkers     This movie is something everyone plays a good part on this movie. (as A actor or actress) It shows how crooket cops work in cases. But anyway Denzel plays the bad guy you can say. And he drives a rookie cop around the city. I think there in Cail maybe not. And shows him how to work but he is really trying to get money for these Russians. It's more to it than that but you get to see the ghetto gangs and even a mafia type gang. The real world you can say. And I will not tell too much of the movie but ya should like it's worth buying. Something to sit down and look at.
B000002HIK|3.0|...as per my 'Richard D James Album' review, there is more engaging electronica available out there for me.  I would agree with a previous reviewer that this is more mature than that earlier album, but if I gave this more than 3 stars I would be ranking it with Autechre, Oval and Pole etc albums (see below for some suggestions) - it's just not in their league for me.    The best tracks on this album are the more 'driven' ones.  For a more consistently 'musicianly' album, try out RDJ's 'Selected Ambient Works 85 - 92'.  There are some memorable tunes on that album and some lashings of the tongue-in-cheek quirky RDJ style that work better for me there than they do here.    For the musically adventurous, who want something more cerebrally and emotionally challenging than this, try:    - Autechre (Ae) - anything, but especially 'Incunabula' (the first Ae album and closer to a 'techno' style than the more ascetic and eclectic later stuff); 'ep7' (actually a full-length album, and tending towards the later, more frenetic Ae style); 'Confield' (a sonic masterpiece, but not an easy listen in parts)  - Oval - especially '94 Diskont' and 'Systemich'  - Pole - especially '1' and 'R'  - Boards of Canada - 'Geogaddi' - a desert island disc for this little 'electronic esoterica' duck!  Don't let others' reviews fool you - this is BOC's best album  - Datacide - 'Flowerhead' - for me one of the best 'dark' ambient albums around  - Bill Laswell - 'Ambient Compendium' - some masterful Laswell collaborations on a 2cd set that is engaging from 'go to whoa'  - Lull - 'Continue' - only one 60+ minute track, but it is a fabulous one that keeps an emotional hold on me throughout  - Zoviet France - not much of their stuff available, but 'Collusion' is good  - Nobukazu Takemura - 'Scope' - a fabulous, 'glitchy' album.  This guy has prodigious talent, as RDJ does, but uses it far more wisely in my view      Don't let me put you off this album though. It's good, just not the best!
0446677450|4.0|I think the book could have been written better. The way the book was written was to sell more books! Mr. Kiyoski has a new line of books called \\"Rich man advisors\\". In his book \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\" he is hinting towards making it rich in real estate by buying foreclosures and going to banks and mortgage companies looking for inventoried houses. In Houston Texas this is hard to do since there are investors that already lined up with bankers and mortgage people.  <br /> <br />I am thinking like how a rich person would think however as a result from what I learned in the book. You do not have to have a lot of money to start making your money work for you. How I am getting my money working for me is I am leasing an Internet server for $100 per month, so far I am hosting 20 accounts and making $200 per month in income, it is not much and I could make as much as $5,000 per month if I could get 500 accounts which is the limit of the server, the biggest problem I am running into is marketing my hosting service and getting more people to lease space on the server. It is proof that changing you mindset will work for you and to get others doing the work.  <br /> <br />The biggest problem in implementing my plan is marketing. Mr. Kiyoski endorsed a book called \\"Sales Dogs\\" which is part of his Rich dad advisors series. I have 3 chapters left in reading the book, I will also have my girlfriend read it so she can also help me implement some of the ideas in that book as well.  <br /> <br />Overall it gets you to thinking and you have to be creative to find your niche, if you invest in making money instead of spending it you will have that much more. In the $100 profit I am making off my leased server I am able to buy 5 new DVD's a month, instead of  spending my initial $100 on DVD's now I have an income stream to buy more. Be creative when you read the book and you to will start thinking like the rich.  <br />
B00005JL2O|3.0|The first one was good, the second one was the best, by part three, it just got old.<br /><br />Austin Powers returns for his third movie, this time going after Goldmember, rescuing his father, hooking up with Foxy Cleopatra, and ends with a huge family reunion that hasn't been done since Star Wars' Return of the Jedi.<br /><br />This movie had a few laughs, but seriously this was just getting repetetive. Plus Goldmember was an absolutly terrible character. The skin eating was just stupid. Dr. Evil does a cool rap in the prison with Mini-me, but the song he did in part two was way better. It seems everything in part two was better. Fat Bastard, Mini-me, and even Austin himself. I know this was a great proiject for Mike Myers, but even he should know that after this trilogy it's time to hang up the ruffles for good.<br /><br />If you have one and two, of course you;ll get this to complete the set, but I think it is the worst of the three. It depended too much on cameos it seems to get the big belly laughs. Of course I'll admit that watching Britney Spears explode may be the best scene in all three movies.

B0001ZX0PG|3.0|I'm a fan of the novel \\"Mystic River\\" by Dennis Lehane and read it twice before I saw the movie. Having said that, I think the movie falls a bit short. The full weight of the tragedy never quite sets in and the sense of moral outrage that was there at the end of the book, is all but absent at the end of the film. Frankly, I'm not real sure Clint Eastwood was the right director for this film. I'd like to see what Martin Scorsese would have done with it. I like Eastwood's work, but \\"Mystic River\\" feels a bit over simplified to me. For instance, Jimmy's wife Annabeth is a lot scarier in the book than she is in the movie and the same goes for the entire Savage family. In the book Jimmy more or less succums to their malevolent influence as they leach the marrow from his soul. There's also a sense of ultimate betrayal in the book that's never fully realized in the film. However, the movie does have it's strengths. The cast was excellent, the photography was great, the locations were good and the sets were very believable.    Dennis Lehane's novel is a complex, multi-faceted urban tragedy, full of living breathing caracters, with multiple subplots. Most of those types of story telling devises will not translate over to the medium of film, no matter who the director is. I do like the movie and I stood in the rain for an hour waiting to see it at last years Austin Film Festival, but I think it could have been better. In my opinion, 21 Grams is the movie Mystic River should have been.  Just read the book, then see the movie.
B00005JNBQ|3.0|Well, I can appreciate the movie for its dedication to whatever it is. It certainly succeeds in being monotonous, boring, dull, and suburban. But one thing confuses me about what some people have to say about this movie. They call it hilarious. Sure, I got a couple chuckles here and there for the overall pathetic-ness of some of the characters, and the dance scene with Napoleon at the end of the movie is worth seeing, but I cannot pinpoint a single joke in the entire movie. The characters aren't loveable, and they're pathetic and exaggerated in their lack of energy, but there's also very little personality, and there's just no comedy in this film at all. <br />Perhaps people who find this film funny relate to this Napoleon character and his small town... I feel bad for you! <br />Keep in mind that some people who enjoy this film so much thought Anchorman with Will Ferrel was \\"stupid\\". I sincerely hope that people who share this opinion develop a real taste for comedy some day. I can't even call this film quirky. <br />Want a real comedy with real actors and a more intelligent comedic approach to benign every day life? Try Bartleby with Crispin Glover. That movie made me laugh hard and it evokes some sort of thought. <br />Napoleon Dynamite does neither. <br /> <br />Rent this and buy Anchorman.
B000001IPL|3.0|I hate reviewers who rate an anlbums songs one after another, it shows only that the reviewers capacity on writing is low. All the reviewers who does this all gives the album top score. They could just write \\"This album rox\\" or something else equal [...]to save space. Ok, so now to the album. This is probably the only record in the \\"made-punk-dead-forever\\"-era. While the singers voice makes me wanna [...] riht on my stereo, it actually fits with the poppy metal-influenced melodies and the back-up vocals. Anyone who heard their later MTV-music probably hated the singersvoice, becouse it was more anoying then, and then they never were able to listen to Offspring. I heard this early, I was into Bad Religion and NOFX at the time, so I never had that problem. But of course, any NOFX record kicks this CD's [...] anytime, so save your toilet some problem and buy one of them instead.    Oh, and all you peole who writes \\"how can The Offspring not be punk and still sell punk out\\" in your reviews gets our answer here: Offspring were never punk, but they played at the fading independent label Epitaph at the time, and soon after \\"Smash\\" people soon started listening to NOFX and Pennywise(Pennywise is very boring but still \\"underground\\" enough to not be listened to if it wasn't for \\"Smash\\", \\"Dookie\\" and \\"...And Out Come The Wolves\\". Punk or not, Epitaph didn't deserve to be marked like that.    Sorry for my spelling, but I'm Swedish :P.
B00005JKHP|3.0|I liked Shat's performance in this. He did a great job. I like the crew's uniforms here. They look like what the creww should've worn on TOS. I actually loathe the arctic-like uniforms they wore from Wrath of Khan on. I see nothing wrong with Stephen Collins as the Will Decker character being respectful to Admiral Kirk (unlike another poster here). Ilya exhibits a certain sexuality once she dons the bathrobe and high heeled sandals. It's admittedly a slow film but that gives us more time with the TOS characters. Better with repeated viewings.
B000002KB8|4.0|After 30+ years this debut from the Birmingham quartet still sounds fresh and chilling. And this, my friends, is how heavy metal was cast upon the world.  <br /> <br />ALong with Deep Purple in Rock, Machine Head, some of Zeppelin's works, Black Sabbath started what would soon become a mainstream.
B000002UEB|4.0|Someone will ask himself why I didn't give 5 stars to this album. Good question, indeed!  <br /> <br />But believe me, people, this record is always worth a listen, even if you don't like neither progressive nor metal: it's a GREAT heavy album of the 80s, maybe the greatest one. <br /> <br />I don't like very much QR's lyrics but that's MY problem
B00005JNBQ|2.0|The other night I was at a friend's house. We were bored, so we decided to rent a movie. At the movie store, we spotted Napoleon Dynamite, the movie that people were calling 'Hilarious'......We rented it and went back to my friend's house to watch it. <br /> <br />This was by FAR the worst movie I have ever seen. What is it that people see in this movie?  <br /> <br />I'm not going to tell people not to see it. Why? Because my friend was laughing his heart out.....and it's usually very tough to make that particular friend of mine laugh. So I suggest you see it. No matter if it's funny or stupid to you, it will stick in your memory for a long, long time.
B0006284JQ|1.0|The more Britney Spears' star fades, the less clothes she wears.  Sad but true that that's her best talent.  Spears never had a voice, only a radical backup band and massive sync sounds to make that mewing sound like a human voice.  Hey, there's always a pole waiting for her on Bourbon Street.  It's where she belongs because she sure can't sing!
B00003CX9S|4.0|Based on the true story of the \\"elephant man\\" and shot in black and white, this is an unforgettable film.  While the plight of John Merrick is in itself fascinating, David Lynch's cinematic artistry brings a well-balanced storytelling that's neither over-dramatic nor phony.  The black and white production is a little difficult on the eyes sometimes, and a few scenes drag on for too long, but the film is engaging.  My only other gripe is Hopkins's so-so performance as the doctor.<br /><br />This is a film no movie lover should miss.
B000006TRV|5.0|I have heard great, and I mean great, music.  Led Zeppelin is considered to be the greatest band.  I disagree.  They are ONE of the greatest bands, or come in a very close second.  Pink Floyd is the greatest band.  I know several people will disagree with me, but that's okay.  I am just stating my musical opinion.  This album is great. <br /> <br />I grew up listening to my dad's Dark Side of the Moon.  When I was younger, I couldn't appreciate the music that I now know is some of the greates music in existence.  I was finally able to acquire this album after listening to the vinyl version, which is unbelievable.  I have to say, I love this album.  I listen to it all the time, while I'm cooking or doing homework.  It's incredibly soothing.  It's the beginnings of progressive rock that this band started.  The style of music is incredible, not always favored by everyone.  Some may call it an 'acquired taste'.  From songs like Young Lust to Comfortably Numb, never does it get old.  With lyrics that sometimes seem to make no sense, they are filled with deep symbolism.  Though this is only my musical opinion, I urge you to stop listening to all the crap played today, such as Yellowcard and Kanye West, and please don't be like all the kids in my school.  This is not to say there isn't good music in the present, but branch out from the pop and rap fad, it will only lead to bad and worse music.
B000002UV9|3.0|unbelievable? not at all... but somewhat disappointing <br /> <br />the whole album is a pop album well arranged to look like a metal one... <br /> <br />the songs are complex enough to be worth a listen, anyway
B0002858YS|5.0|I don't usually write reviews on Amazon. But if I write, there is a reason behind that. My favorite songs in this album are 1) Mr Brightside 2) Smile Like you mean it 3) Somebody told me. The band is really outside the realm of mainstream music. Hope you enjoy it too.
B0002TT0NW|5.0|Great series, huh? My whole family enjoys every one of the Harry Potter movies. My wife tells me the movies don't compare to the books, but since I hate to read, I'll never find out for myself.... Great special effects, great plot, great acting, great charactors.<br /><br />Heck it's a great movie, what else can I say?<br /><br />If you like Harry Potter movies, then this one is a \\"must see\\".<br /><br />When's the next one coming out?
B00005JNBQ|4.0|When I first saw the previews for this movie I was not interested in seeing it at all. My friend, however, saw it in the theatres and insisted it was hilarious and made me and a few of my other friends go see it. She was cracking up the entire time, while the 4 of us were sitting there slightly chuckling once in a while, but mainly glaring at her for making us waste an hour and a half of our time and the money for the ticket. After we saw it though, we started randomly quoting the movie to the point where we did it so much that we wanted to see it again. The second time around it was definitely a lot more funny. I guess this is the kind of movie that slowly grows on you if you don't love it at first. Now all of us love the movie, have a copy of it, and still quote it. It's flippin sweet!
B000000OUJ|5.0|Like my title says, there is a problem with the mindstate of the human music listener... of 2004-2005. And her review below this one is living proof. First thing, don't come off in no Hip Hop or Wu Tang album section if you're looking for some candy rap Nelly issh. Go to MTV.com. The problem with today's current generation of preteens or teens at that is that they do not understand the potentness or creativity that went into making this album what it is. Wu Tang will forever be one of the baddest groups of all time and this CD is another staple that solidifies that. Getting 5 mics in the source in 1995 was next to impossible. Very few albums got this mark of approval. Liquid Swords is no exception. Its your turn to find out why
B00006L7XQ|5.0|The cover of this CD has one word: \\"Cash.\\"  No album title.  There is but one picture superimposed over the black background: the profile of an eldlery but dignified man, his eyes closed, his head bowed down in difference and respect.<br /><br />Such is Johnny Cash.  A musical legend, a cultural icon.  Sure, the good reviews of this album (and the awards it received) may stem from the fact that it was Cash's last studio recording.  Okay, but that aside, it is still a great album--bare-bones tracks that feature the singular voice of The Man in Black.<br /><br />These songs range from true love to utter dispair.  Cash's originals are as great as ever: the title track has to be one of the best songs he's ever recorded.  Yet, it is the cover-songs that surprise you most; most notably Nine Inch Nails' \\"Hurt,\\" The Eagles' \\"Desperado,\\" and Sting's \\"I Hung My Head.\\"  Each song is given only basic production--lending it a new voice and atmosphere unique to Johnny Cash.  Incredible.<br /><br />AMERICAN IV: THE MAN COMES AROUND is an astounding CD.  It will move you, it will touch you in ways you did not know music could do.  Johnny Cash is, and will always be, a legend.  A country music artist through-and-through, he managed to connect country to every other musical genre.  Johnny Cash is a true artist.  There's no other word for it.
0316096199|4.0|I read Lucky for my senoir english class and really enjoyed it.  It is brutal and honest, and would help any reader better understand rape and what happens to a person who experiences such a horrible thing.  It is very well written and riveting
1400032717|4.0|I find this novel very appealing because it is told in first person. Readers can very easily feel for Christopher Boone and his dillemas. Moreover, this book goes through a wide variety of situations which will no doubt play with your emotions. It is both hilarious and tearjerker material (well, maybe not a tearjerker... lets just say its more funny than it is sad... and if I mentioned the sad parts, I would ruin the mystery & intrigue). The reason why I gave it four stars however was because of the corny/dry ending (or so I thought).    For the most part, this book follows almost the same formula as Daniel Keye's \\"Flowers for Algernon\\", which I highly recommend although it was more sad & not funny. It gets you to sympathize for the main character (and it is very effective at doing this). One of the main differences, which got me to like this book was that it had tidbits of information--a characteristic similar to Dan Brown's \\"The Davinci Code\\". And although Haddon's is not quite as good Keye's classic--it still makes for a good read and makes you wonder about Autism.
B0006399FS|4.0|I am amazed at some of the rediculous reviews here.  Many of them dont seem to be serious.  I've heard far worse from U2.  Some of the songs miss here (which is why I gave it 4 stars).  But if you want to talk about classic bands making bad CD's, I could tell you a bunch of them and their fans seem to give them better reviews them someone with mass popularity.  That goes to show you when a group loses it's mass popularity, and the real fans are left (then you'll get a proper evaluation).  Ironically, U2 has made great records when they least expected it.  Joshua Tree was made early on, and the band had no idea at the time they were making a great classic record.  Then, as they were experimenting with new sounds and alternative, they cranked out Achtung Baby (what a winner that was).  And then three times was again a charm after fans got a bit tired of the alternative phase and they just went into the studio without big expectation on themselves and surprisingly made All That You can leave Behind which was great for most reasons you wouldnt have expected it to be.  Just great songs, vocals, simple arrangements, it's one of my favorites.  Now with the expectations UP again, U2 had no idea what what come next.  They just made the next release in the proper phase and it has a lot of good songs on it, and some great guitar work from the Edge (something I didnt expect).  Would it have been nice to have a All You can Leave Behind 2?  Well maybe, but that's not realistic.  Then everyone would be saying, they tried to copy the exact same sound.  Look at the people who criticized Sting for making Sacred Love (a clone to his previous surprise hit).  I for one will keep buying U2 CD's and I am hoping for the 4th big surprise, and who knows what sound or phase that will be.  If there is a 4th time around, these guys arent getting any younger, but they might just have another album of the year in them.  I admit, it wont be How To Dismantle an Atomic Bomb.   Then again, it's far from a bad CD!
B000000WZ4|5.0|I asked my co-worker (and friend) to lend me any of the Depeche Mode cds he had and he brought me 6 cds (2 of them were Depeche Mode cds).  I heard this cd version in my car and I loved it!  Especially the \\"It's No Good\\" because It's Very Good!  I love the strangely enigmatic beat, melody, and the lyric.  Now this is \\"the song\\" that's on Repeat mode in my car at the moment.  I think it'll take a little longer than I expected to return this cd to my friend.
0316666343|4.0|The Lovely Bones is about a fourteen year old girl looking down from heaven as her family and friends deal with her rape and murder.  The depiction of heaven is very different, and seeing the lives of Susie's family chang is interesting.  It is somewhat disturbing yet touching.  The plot is intreging, you won't want to put it down.  Sebold really knows how to write and does a wonderful job writing through the eyes of a fourteen year old. I would definately recommend this book for someone looking for an exciting and interesting novel.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|ok, first things first. Yes, Jet does sound like many other bands and many people are turned off from the album because it isn't \\"original\\". But let me ask you a question; What is original in this day and age? Everything that is good, has been tampered with and done. That is why i basically listen to classic rock, the original stuff. But when an album like Get Born comes along, you've got to know when to just say, \\"hey its not that original, but its a damn good cd!\\" and just enjoy it for what it is. Jet may end up changing their style with the next album, but that will probably end up being a huge loss to them, and to us, the listeners. When you have a huge hit like this album, there is no reason to change your style. I gave this album 5 stars, and it deserves 5 stars. Everyone has different taste in music, i know. So, all im saying is if you like the good  classic stuff like the stones, pink floyd, etc. give this album a try, you won't need another one...
B00004WKII|5.0|My hopes were high for this and I was not let down. This 4-CD box set has a beautiful purple velvet surface, an excellent 80-page color booklet, and, most importantly, some of the best Hendrix songs out there. The 4 CD's are in chronological order, with the first one starting in 1966 as the Experience formed and the last disc ending just weeks before Hendrix's death. On this set there are some great alternate versions of well-loved Hendrix songs, like the amazing instrumental version of \\"Little Wing\\", an early take of \\"Purple Haze\\", a breathtaking live \\"Red House\\", and a highly entertaining extended version of \\"Third Stone from the Sun.\\" There are also completely new, rarely or never before heard songs, such as the venemous blues \\"Here he Comes/Lover Man\\" and an impressive cover of Van Morrison's \\"Gloria\\". All in all, this jaw-dropping box set is a perfect addition to any true fan's collection. At 50 bucks or less, it's one of the grestest deals I've seen.
B000268QB2|4.0|Keane is a beautiful, soft-rock band that is easy to listen to, heartfelt, and with lovely lyrics. Some rhythmns are slightly repetitive (as with some lyrics), which is why I gave it a 4, but overall I love this CD and highly recommend it.
B00005JMUL|3.0|Ah, Christmas is here: the presents, the joyous choir harmonizing in a way to annoy the humbug neighbors, the celebration of the birth of Christ, and more Christmas movies, naughty or nice (mostly naughty).<br /><br />' *REVIEW* '<br /><br />Is it with my obligation to watch at least one theatrical film on this holiday season, just to have a little entertainment on this merry month.  I had hoped that there is going to be a Christmas film this year that might brighten up my already-dull and apathetic holiday spirit.  \\"The Polar Express\\", with all its magic and innocence, didn't do it for me as a spirit-lifter.  However, I was mostly entertained with this movie.<br /><br />Just to let you know, I didn't read the original picture book the movie was based on, so I'm just going to judge the movie based on the execution alone, not by its adaptation.  In a movie where almost nobody seems to have a first name, it's about the Hero Boy who does not have the spirit of Christmas and doesn't believe in Santa Claus, due to the harsh actualization of the season.  His frown would soon to be turned upside-down when a train stop at his house at night.  The Hero Boy got close to the train where he met a Conductor who told the boy about The Polar Express that goes to the north pole, and that the boy was the train's last stop to pick.  Going from uncertainty to curiosity at the last minute, the boy decides to hop on for the ride of his life.  With his new friends, the black Hero Girl and the Know-it-all who doesn't know when to keep his mouth shut, he's on a train ride to a magical place that could teach him to believe and to understand the true meaning of Christmas.<br /><br />Usually, I lengthen my reviews to give details on the pluses and minuses of movies and so forth, but since this Christmas, and people like to relax without a hint of stress in Christmas, I'm gonna keep this short.  \\"The Polar Express\\" looks amazing and so whimsical, but this new \\"Performance Capture\\" technique could've been perfect if the characters don't look so dead-in-the-eyes; maybe THAT'S why people find this movie's spooky.  Like every G-rated cartoon films of yesteryear, sing-alongs are necessary here; fortunately, there's little of them in this movie, and they weren't so over-the-top, even if Steven Tyler`s singing number got me in an awkward mood.  Tom Hanks, as always, did a fantastic job playing not only the Conductor, but the Hobo, Santa Claus, and surprisingly, the boy (thank goodness for audio effects).  Now if the movie was just as fantastic as his acting.  I like the movie, but this film could've be more astonishing than what it is.  First, the movie became reliant with perilous scene after perilous scene, and while they are fun to see, they become tedious.  Second, it's a little too predictable for its own good.  Finally, and the rotten eggnog of problems, I thought this movie would be more than just a Christmas movie; a movie that can stand alone to the masterpieces of cinema.  \\"The Polar Express\\" is a typical Santa-esque Christmas movie in its own restricted fault, and with its magical appeal, the kids would obvious love it, though I doubt parents would find anything significant in this movie, other than to relieve some childhood memory.<br /><br />THE FINAL WORD: Joyride.  Watching \\"The Polar Express\\" is like riding a roller coaster: they're intense and fun to experience, and while it's something you want to experience it again, you pretty much know what you're gonna get.  The movie looks beautiful, but it can't stack the profound quality like \\"It's A Wonderful Life.\\"  However, I'm still gonna recommend this movie, because it's great for what it is: a family-fun holiday flick.  Watch it not as a classic, but just watch it for yuletide enjoyment.acters don't look so dead-in-the-eyes; maybe THAT'S why people find this movie's spooky.

B00012FXAE|5.0|James Cameron's awareness of what happens in the darkness of a theater while the light is flickering on the silver screen is tremendous.  Aliens, the sequel to Alien (1979), displays his cinematic skills of directing a fast-paced believable science fiction film combined with dreadful horror.  The horror of Aliens grasps the audience by the throat from the beginning and slowly drops of some strange pod that will later explode inside the torso of the audience freezes the viewer as fear spreads.  Despite being a sequel, Aliens seems to supersede the original in horror and suspense as the aliens crawl 12 meters, 11 meters, 10 meters, 8 meters, and closing while remaining hidden from the audience.<br /><br />After Ripley's (Sigourney Weaver) escape from the Nostromo she has been adrift in space for 57 years when a salvage space craft discovers her by a mere chance.  Returning to an Earth space station Ripley finds out that her daughter died at the age of 66, which causes her much grief as she did not fulfill her promise to return to her on her 11th birthday.  In addition, when the company for which she works for hears her story of the events on Nostromo they do not believe her.  The company dismisses her as they deem her unfit for flight duty while making sure that they get psychological evaluations in order to keep her at a safe distance from the company's interests.  Despite the company's disbelief, Ripley is caught in a post-traumatic nightmare that haunts her as she frequently wakes up drenched in sweat while being in a zombie state while awake.<br /><br />For the past 20 years people have been populating the planet, where Ripley's crew discovered the predator-like alien life form, through creating an artificial breathable atmosphere through technological advances.  However, when contact with the planet mysteriously is disrupted the company sends Burke (Paul Reiser) to convince Ripley to join them on an investigative voyage to find out what happened at the space station.  Together with a group of Colonial Marines, for whom Ripley is to function as a consultant, she returns to the source of her recurrent nightmares as she must deal with her lost years as a mother.<br /><br />Aliens was nominated for several Oscars, but only ended up with the Oscar in the special effects department.  The special effects are brilliant as the alien life forms seem alive and ready to kill anything in their path.  In addition, the mise-en-scene brings the film an authentic atmosphere which is essential for the films success as weapons, environment, and space crafts elevate the cinematic experience.  Last, but not least, the performances of the cast is terrific as there is a wide range of characters that offer intrigue and further suspense as Aliens in the end turns out to be an excellent film that offers some truly harrowing shocks.station.

B00000634J|5.0|I highly suggest this album to Beatles fans and newcomers of John Lennon solo work. This \\"greatest hits\\" album encapsulates the musical diversity and genius of John Lennon's solo career, paying fair attention to his ROCK AND ROLL album, which everyone should check out. If there is one thing missing on this album, it is Lennon's version of GOD--a brilliant and radical song for its time. Nevertheless, this album is quite comprehensive and offers the listener a sizable number of tracks and eclectic musical experimentation. To denigrate this anthology simply because it lacks one essential Lennon solo track would be to unfairly judge an album that equally provides the new listener to one of the most important musicians and artists of the twentieth century--if not of all time.
B00005JLFC|5.0|Hardly ever did I see a more moving tale; hardly ever -if ever- did I hear a more beautiful voice and better lyricks. The tale is of all times: discrimination, love and 'lust' for freedom. The songs are of all times: beauty, love and selfredemption. In short, a masterpiece which surpasses time
6305972591|3.0|No other author in recent memory has had as much consistent success selling books as Stephen King. For roughly three decades the Maine writer churned out book after book, each one selling more and more copies. He's a world unto himself, the lucky fellow! He's so successful that he could throw out his pens, put away his typewriters, bury his word processor six feet under, never write another word in his life, and STILL have enough money to wallpaper the Great Wall of China five times over. In many respects, it's Stephen King's world and the rest of us are just living in it. But, and this is a gigantic but, an enormous number of metaphysically bad films based on his novels threaten to put a serious dent in his legacy. We all know the good ones, the ones that not only scared audiences stiff but also helped propel King's career to even greater heights. \\"Carrie\\" is probably the best example, followed by \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" and \\"The Dead Zone.\\" These are wonderful, magical films that one can watch again and again without wearying of them. Then there are the rest: the truly wretched refuse that reminds one of dental plaque or the junk that washes up on the shores of a filthy river. Welcome to the Children of the Corn franchise.<br /><br />\\"Children of the Corn,\\" hammered together from a King short story, introduces us to freshly minted physician Burt (Peter Horton) and his significant other Vicky (Linda Hamilton) as they are driving across the country to Burt's first post-medical school stint. The arduous journey begins to takes its toll on the two as they wander through the Midwest, specifically Nebraska. Nothing but open skies, cornfields, and ranting preachers on the airwaves are around to keep Burt and Vicky entertained, and that doesn't last too long. There is also some tension between the two concerning their relationship, with Burt suffering from the predictable \\"guy scared to make a commitment\\" mentality we've seen in nearly every film made since the beginning of the twentieth century. These problems soon take a backseat, however, when Burt accidentally plows his car into a boy standing in the middle of the road. A cursory examination of the body reveals a shocking revelation: instead of perishing as a result of the car accident, someone slashed this kid's throat moments before the couple came along. Burt searches the cornfield a few yards off the highway and finds a suitcase spattered with blood, further evidence that something quite grim is afoot. The city slickers resolve to head to the nearest town, Gatlin, to report the apparent murder.<br /><br />They soon discover that finding Gatlin is about as easy as finding El Dorado. Signs pointing the way to the town seem to contradict one another. Even the tentative help they get from a crusty old gas station attendant, who also tells them to avoid the town in a way that evokes memories of Crazy Ralph from \\"Friday the 13th,\\" doesn't initially help them. Nonetheless, Burt and Vicky soon roll into what looks like a ghost town. Cornhusks adorn the buildings and blow through the streets like tumbleweeds. The stores are decrepit, refuse filled shells. Even the courthouse looks like a neutron bomb went off inside. Only when Burt and Vicky stumble over two kids playing a board game in an abandoned house, Job (Robby Kiger) and Sarah (AnnMarie McEvoy), do they begin to understand the horror residing in Gatlin, Nebraska. We the audience learned long before what happened, and what continues to happen, in this strange place. Some years before the children in the town fell under the influence of youthful preacher named Isaac (John Franklin), a scary looking kid who ordered his adherents to murder every adult in town because \\"He Who Walks Behind the Rows\\" commanded such an action. With the help of his beefy henchman Malachai (Courtney Gains), Isaac continues to perform bizarre rituals that allow him to keep the others in line. Obviously, Burt and Vicky must challenge his authority, andthe legitimacy of \\"He Who Walks Behind the Rows,\\" if they wish to survive.<br /><br />The first film, you will hear stalwarts say over and over again, isn't that bad of a movie. In fact, a few of them will look you straight in the eyes and say \\"Children of the Corn\\" is not only one of the best horror films out there, it is also one of the best Stephen King cinematic adaptations ever to grace the silver screen. These are the individuals who will one day find employment as circus barkers, car salesmen, or politicians. \\"Children of the Corn\\" starts out with lots of promise, about a minute's worth, which gives these apologists' opinions an initial veneer of respectability. After Vicky sings that song to Burt at the hotel room, the movie starts its long decline into banality. The road scenes run on forever, the presence of the elderly gas station attendant is a horror film clich&eacute;, and we never see the demonic force stalking through the cornfields. Worse, there is little gore and the special effects, particularly during the final showdown between the outsiders and the demon, attain the heights of laughable cheesiness. The only bright spots in the film are Isaac and Malachai, in large part due to their sneering visages and the biblical mumbo jumbo they spout every time they appear onscreen.<br /><br />I just learned Anchor Bay released a Special Edition disc of \\"Children of the Corn\\" complete with a commentary track and featurette. The version I watched--the \\"unspecial\\" edition, perhaps?--contained only the film and a trailer. As boring as the picture is, I'm still going to give it three stars because several of the sequels that follow it make this one look like \\"Citizen Kane.\\" Give it a watch if you must, but be prepared for a big disappointment.and the legitimacy of \\"He Who Walks Behind the Rows,\\" if they wish to survive. <br /> <br />The first film, you will hear stalwarts say over and over again, isn't that bad of a movie.

0156711427|1.0|This book threatens meaning badly. <br /> <br />DONT BUY THIS BOOK. NOW !!! <br /> <br />(too bad it isnt possible to give less then one star)
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I love this movie so much! I think it perfectly highlights how awkward and often boring it is to be a teenager. It illustrates that the best way to make it through is to find something you're interested in and being yourself. <br /> <br />The characters are original and very interesting and the script is so quotable <br /> <br />It's not the type of movie that you watch for plot. If you watch this movie and expect some kind of plot twist or whatever, go watch a Hitchcock film. This movie is one you watch to identify with the characters, laugh at the characters, and quote the script. <br />
B000002NBY|5.0|This album was a groundbreaking confluence of South African music seamlessly meshed with Rock and Zydeco. Simon took a risk with this total departure from his very successful American Folk/Pop and it paid off handsomely and became one of the best selling albums of all time. Sometimes being artistic and not playing it safe pays off.  <br /> <br />Every song on this sounds happy and feels like a celebration of something. My personal faves are the obvious...\\"Boy in the Bubble, Graceland, Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes and You Can Call Me Al\\", but there isn't a weak track to be found. In the liner notes, Simon gives you some background on each song. There are many guest musicians throughout, including Adrian Belew, Linda Ronstadt, The Everly Brothers and Los Lobos. I would rank this as the highest peak of the many peaks in Paul Simon's career. <br />
B00000JLWW|1.0|This film is all bark and no bite.  I have no idea what everyone sees in this movie.  I don't think that it really deserved all those Academy Awards.  It was too long and drawn out, all icing and no cake. It was unrealistic and had bad acting on Leonardo DiCaprio's and Kate Winslet's part. I also found the dialog cheesy and laughable.   It was exceedingly hard to sit through, let alone take seriously and as a result I'm forced to give it a 1
B0002Y4T92|5.0|Great DVD set of a great concert!!  <br /> <br />I agree with other reviews, the selections for the DVDs were not well thought out, but what the hell, the DVD's are still well worth the purchase price. Also, the sound and picture quality of the DVD's is excellent.   <br /> <br />Clapton once again delivers, but in my opinion he will never top his performance at the Concert for George (Harrison), which was the finest I have seen him play and sound in 35 years!  Now that is a truly great 2 DVD set.
B00005JMUA|5.0|*** This comment may contain spoilers *** <br /> <br /> <br />If you've not seen the movie, and don't want to know what happens, stop reading now. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed watching this movie but I think that the fascinating character of Pei Mei should've been given more depth. I also don't think that the way he died at all made sense to the rest of the movie and I found the manner of death and the fact that he died extraneous. <br /> <br />Uma Thurman is a bad ass as usual but her best scene was the scene where she rips out Elle's other eye and steps on it. That scene *RULED* but the fact that you don't know what happens to her ultimately bothers me. I did like the credits with the cross-out motif. That was creative. <br /> <br />I think that David Carradine, the actor that played Bill, the title character, was boring. I was expecting someone more interesting to play that character. Someone more bad ass like Clint Eastwood or something. I think his death was ironically non-violent and I liked it, it was appropriate. <br /> <br />I rated this movie a 5 because I found it highly entertaining and compared to most other movies that've come out lately, it ROCKED.  <br />
B0000CEB4V|5.0|In my 35 years in the music business, this has to be one of the most awesome concerts, I have every witnessed. I was really never a George Harrison or Beatles fan, so I didn't know if I would like this DVD.  <br /> <br />What an incredible surprise!  Everyone was brilliant, and I have never seen Eric Clapton sound and play better. Jeff Lynne was also brillant, and really helped Eric reach a musical level, that I haven't seen Clapton reach since the 70's.  <br /> <br />Also the sound is also well mixed and managed,... not an easy task with that many musicians on-stage.
B00005JMXX|2.0|Initially, I didn't even want to see this film.  I ended up watching it late at night on pay-per-view. <br />While watching this film, I was impressed with the images of Manhattan being flooded and everyone rushing to the public library.  I thought the concept for the movie was cool, but Dennis Quaid was very unbelievable.   <br />Dialogically, this could be the worst movie I've ever seen.  The script was plain awful.  The lines were very plain and bland. <br />Even worse than that, these wolves that were added to the film did not fit and were completely unneccessary.   <br />I am only giving this a 2 instead of a 1 because I thought the imagery was very enjoyable. <br />My advice: put it on mute, and look at the awesome images.
B00007LTIA|5.0|I've been revisiting the prog rock classics that I listened to in my adolescence. As a classically trained professional musician, I was wondering if any of these recordings would thrill me the same way as they did back then. I'm happy to report that they do. I can't imagine anybody with an ear for music not being blown away by the superb musicianship of the members of Yes, ELP and Genesis. (I've also had a chance to listen to Brand X so add them to the list as well!).<br />Which is a longwinded way of getting to Tales from Topographic Oceans. I bought this album back in the 70's and never listened to it more than a couple of times. It left me cold. I guess I was expecting it to really kick ass like Close to the Edge. (Since I've returned to Tales, I have to admit that, at first, I missed the the punch that the bass and drums had on the earlier Yes recordings).<br />Given the dearth of interesting pop music over the last twenty years, I got the CD to give Tales another chance. Now that I have had the opportunity to listen to it a few times, I have to say it is an extremely moving listening experience. Yes, the flaws are well documented (lots of great sections but nothing that holds together overall as well as Close to the Edge, lots of padding, too much of a Steve Howe vanity project, not enough Wakeman, experimental bits that sound way out of place). Now let's talk about the strengths.  This album has the most beautiful music that Yes ever made, bar none. For example, is there anything in all of Yes's recordings that compares to Wakeman's Mellotron and Moog episodes in Remembering? How about the last 5 minutes of &quot;Ancient&quot;? Steve Howe and Jon Anderson are at the top of their form throughout. And the great sections are truly great (Wakeman's Moog solo at the end of Revealing, Squire's bass solo in Ritual, the &quot;Relayer&quot; passages in Remembering, I could go on and on).<br />Although I don't find Ancient &quot;strange&quot; (stranger stuff happens incontemporary classical), it does strike me as out of place. In any case, I admit I haven't warmed up to it (although the opening percussion section with Howe's wailing guitar solo soaring above is cool). The &quot;train wreck&quot; at the climax of Ritual also strikes me as a bit strained. <br />Ignore the critics whose attention span does not exceed three minutes. If the three minute rock anthem is your ideal, then you are simply going to miss out on the strength of Yes's approach to music making: the development of great musical ideas that demand an expanded time frame to reach their emotional peaks. If that happens to be the ideal of classical music rather than rock, so what? To me, that's great music making irrespective of any genre. Find a good stereo, turn off the phone and settle in for a truly remarkable musical experience.
0141439475|5.0|This book is a wonderful piece of literature. It forces the reader to question the origin of evil and wickedness--are people born that way, or is it forced upon them by those around them? Through the eyes of the \\"monster\\", the reader is able to see just how cruel and fearful people can be towards anything that is different than they are despite the many good qualities the \\"different\\" person may posses. In the instance of Frankenstein's creation, the reader comes to realize that he is in fact very intelligent, and a genuinely kind-hearted being who is unfortunately forced to be cruel in order to survive. The reader is able to sympathize with the \\"monster\\" as they see him seek to find love and acceptance in a world. This haunting novel is a timeless classic which will endure through all the ages.
B00009P1O5|4.0|Ok, no one is going to give Neil props for wailing about mashed taters but no T-bone, but Re-Ac-Tor is a fun album that mixes 70s/80s bombast with the ol' Crazy Horse sonic sledgehammer and still comes up a winner. \\"Shots\\" is worth the price of admission alone - a great forgotten classic that is buried at the end of the album. Even \\"Surfer Joe....,\\" which seems like one of those anti-record industry rants that every great artist perpetrates on an unsuspecting listening public  (a la Graham Parker's Mercury Poisoning or Tom Petty's The Last DJ - and why? Do music fans want to know about the innards of the music biz or do they just want to bop along to the songs?), has its charms. Of the four old NY albums that were recently released, both Re-Ac-Tor and On the Beach are worth the investment. The other two, American Stars & Bars and Hawks & Doves, are for completists only - you can get the one must-have song on those discs - \\"Like A Hurricane - in a dozen other places
0316666343|1.0|If I had not had to rad this book for one of my classes, I would not have finished it. After reading the first chapter, I felt dirty and violated. Abigail Salmon's behavior as a mother is shocking and less than admirable, and Mr. Harvey (the villain) eludes punishment from the law for the many rapes and murders he had commited in the past. I personally would not recommend this book to anyone.
0375703764|3.0|House of Leaves is not a horror novel. It's a work of literary fiction pretending to be a part of a different genre. I suspect it's a cheap marketing ploy. It gets a three star rating from me because about half of it is good stuff. Unfortunately, you have to slog through the rest to read the good half, because it's a discontiguous fifty percent. <br /> <br />I think the real problem i have with this book is the masquerade of it's being experimental. It's not. Postmodern writers have been doing this kind of thing for almost two generations. It's unconventional at best, and, depending on how kind you're feeling, an interesting pastiche or verging on plagiarism of the work of dozens of other, better writers. If you haven't read Pale Fire, The Garden of Forking Paths, 100 Years of Solitude, The Crying of Lot 49, Goodbye Columbus, Infinite Jest, or White Noise, you probably would be better reading those than this. If you have read them, that is, if you're a fan of the literary fiction genre, House of Leaves will probably just let you down like it let me down.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|I like this one...but the only con is that they have the good radio hits, but the rest of the songs aren't that great. Jet rocks - that is why I bought the CD. A good choice, just make sure you like the big songs...the rest are just like them. I rated it with 5 stars because it is an album wonderfully done, take a close look at the lyrics they are actually meaningful and are something to sing to and think about. And Jet's talents are great. It's either a love it or just dont quite like it that much CD. If I were you I'd buy it, but keep the stickers and receipt just in case.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I found this movie totally empty of plot, of interest, of good acting, and of good direction.  I have no idea why it won an academy award since I found nothing in the movie that was a story or good acting or good direction.  I recommend anyone who is interested to save their money.
B00005JNSK|5.0|After reading various reviews all over the net and seeing the trailer I have a few things to say that a lot of people apparently don't understand.  This is not a remake of Gene Wilder's \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" which was a classic in it's own right.  This is a much truer adaptation of the classic Roald Dahl story.  It is not a musical which was one rumor.  The only reason the song was in the trailer is that it was a teaser trailer and they didn't want to give too much away.  The characters is this adaptation actually look much more like the book describes them than in the original \\"Willy Wanka\\", even Johnny Depp as the man himself looks more true to the character.  I really liked the trailer and I am a huge Tim Burton and Johnny Depp fan, but they too can make mistakes (i.e. Planet of the Apes, The AStronaut's Wife, From Hell) but these two seem to work well together.  Also the little boy playing Charlie (who played Peter in \\"Finding Neverland\\") also clicks very well with Depp.  I really hope this turns out to be a good movie.
B00006RINF|4.0|I don't know how anyone could choose that stupid rip-off band Evanesence over this! Lacuna Coil are, indeed, a band who are very much in need of wider attention. Cristina Scabbia has got a voice that could give even some of rock's most famous female vocalists a run for their money! Heard 'Heaven's A Lie'? Then you'll would've already known, and even when collided in with male-vocalist Andrea Ferro on tracks like 'Swamped', 'Daylight Dancer', & 'Humane' it'll always be Cristina who will reign supreme and come out on top.  But if anyone here is looking for melody, then not to worry, because unlike many radio friendly wannabe-heavy-bands nowadays, there's melodic touches to ALL 13 songs and will definitely please people who are very much in favour of accessible 'non-threatening' rock music.  'Comalies' is unlikely an album that'll have your parents knocking on your bedroom door thinking you've just sold your soul to the man down stairs, but if your looking for something a little heavy with a hint harmonic singing and meaningful lyrics then look no further.
0316286850|5.0|This book is well written and easy to understand. It offers lots of useful tips. This book is not geared toward the beginner who does not understand what concealer, foundation, and powder are used for or how they are different. Instead the focus of this book is for the person who already knows the everyday use of different products and would like to understand how they can better utilize them.     Individuality is an emphasis that the author gives, which I felt is a good thing. Sometimes you come across a woman who is truly cool toned but looks wonderful with a warm eye shadow. The only way to find these things is to step outside the general \\"rules\\" of make up artistry. Kevyn will help guide you there.     For the beginner I would recommend reading BEAUTY: THE NEW BASICS By Rona Berg. Then you can read this book and fully grasp what Kevyn's telling you.
0316779237|2.0|Being a huge fan of Sedaris' laugh-out loud work, I must admit that I was a bit disappointed with Holidays on Ice. Although this collection of short stories, some fictional, some not, starts out on a great note with \\"The Santa Land diaries,\\" the humor quickly dries out with \\"Season's Greetings,\\" and \\"Christmas Means Giving.\\" Overall, his autobiographical work is much more entertaining than the far-fetched humor he tries to convey in his fictional work.  <br /> <br />Overall, I found this book good only as a travel companion and as a light read to get you in the mood for the holiday season. Aside from \\"Santa Land diaries,\\" don't expect to be rolling with laughter, for the humor in the other stories reeks of Saturday Night Live or MadTV. However, do not be discouraged by this book if this is your first encounter with Sedaris; his other material is much more original and manifest much more shock value than can ever be found here. I would recommend starting with \\"Naked,\\" or \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" to avoid getting a bad first impression from his work.  <br />
B00005IC2H|5.0|The first comment I wanted to make was that the review written by Maude Randwais \\"my opinion is more important than yours!\\" (NJ) above (with a one-star rating) should probably be ignored simply because of her comment about the lead singer \\"uttering nonsense\\"...I would have to say that these are some of the most heartfelt vocals I have ever heard (from someone who is obviously speaking a language other than English!!). I think this album particularly reinforces my appreciation for music from other countries and must be experienced by everyone atleast once. Very moving and uniquely beautiful--definitely respectable and by far worth more than a $1 sell-off at your used record store.
6305603847|3.0|The Wall album is probably one of rock and rolls finest masterpieces.  However, The Wall as a film isn't as wonderful.  All of the actors in the film, one of them being the very talented Bob Hoskins, could have done a great job if given actual lines to say.  The film focused more on creating a collection of music videos to all of the wall songs instead of developing characters and a clear plot.  There are times when Bob Geldof's portrayal of Pink is rather haunting and effective, especially when he transforms himself into the leader of the surrogate band.  I am not sure what director Alan Parker intended for this film, but his concept just didn't work.  For example, the film lapses into strange and wonderfully powerful animation sequences, courtesy of the awesome Gerald Scarfe, and then makes an awkward transition back into the real time story.  The animation sequences are entertaining to watch, but they don't serve to solidify the plot or develop the characters.  However, the DVD has some really cool special features including a making of featurette and some music videos as well as easter eggs.  Enjoy!
1592400876|4.0|Apparently this book was some sort of runaway bestseller in England (and from what I've heard, it isn't doing too bad here either), though this surprises me. I wouldn't have thought this book would be interesting to anyone who wasn't an English student or teacher, writer, editor, or someone else in the field. It goes to show you, you never can tell what is going to catch on. The book is well-written and really delves into matters of punctuation. One warning, it was written in England, so some of the rules are a little different than what we have over here.
B000003TAR|5.0|I'll start this off without any words of respect for MTV, which I hate with every fiber of my being. If it wasn't for MTV, I (or anyone else for that matter) never would have been introduced to Nirvana. I insist on being ungrateful to the corporate machine that is MTV. I hate how MTV introduced the beautiful and heartwrenching \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" to me. I also hate how MTV introduced the revolutionary \\"Teen Spirit\\" music video to the world. I especially hate the hours upon hours of free programming and music videos they've given me over the past two decades. That especially bites. The reason why MTV is such corporate swine is because they sponsored, televised, and released the fabulous MTV Unplugged in New York Nirvana gig. That gig was the most awesome sight I've ever beheld, but since I hate MTV, so I'm angry Nirvana agreed to do it. Oh, how conflicted I am.
B000002A46|5.0|Mariah proves that she has the greatest voice ever with this album..I listened to the entire cd all the way through, and obviously the stand out tracks are O Holy Night, Joy to the World and All I Want For Christmas, but this is the classic Holiday Album hands down.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|This live album captured UFO at their collective musical heights. It also continues to be left in the closet which is a sad statement. If you are familiar with the guitarist Michael Schenker or are not. His playing alone on this record makes this opus a must own. Everything in the production was top caliber as well. Hear a double bass kick played in front of metalheads for one of the very first times a metal band utilized this invention of madness. Mogg's lyrical storytelling leaves etches in the mind that last for the rest of your life. If you dig 70's and 80's metal, this was as real as Ozzy's hangovers in those days. Buy it! You will not be let down.
B0006399FS|4.0|WOW! thats all i can really say, i mean WOW! this album blew me away from the first count in &quot;Vertigo&quot; to the last note in &quot;Yahweh&quot;. Honestly, next to Achtung Baby, this is U2's best album.<br />Especially love the song &quot;Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own&quot;. Bono puts the same emmotion into that song as he did for &quot;One&quot; or any of the acoustic versions of &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; i have seen them play. Defineately the best track on the album. <br />Lets not forget, U2 has given us 4 Immortal albums that will last forever, I would say this was the 5th. I only hope that the band can keep up with themselves in the future!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Please do not let the people you love watch this film!  You have been warned.  This movie made me so frustrated and annoyed.  I felt like I was trapped in somebody's nightmare and could not escape for an hour and a half... Please DO NOT watch this film if you're bored. It will make you feel like breaking your television, dvd, and throwing them all out the window.  What hell was the writers and directors thinking?  People should NOT be allowed to watch films like these.  It was so so so baddddddd...  why on earth would someone create such a boring, unhumerous, piece of crap like this film?  I hope this movie was supposed to be a terrible joke- because it wasn't even stoopid funny.  Good God why would anyone give these directors money to make this crap????      I gave it 5 stars, because i was hitting my head against the wall the whole time for renting this crappy movie. [...]
B00020HEG6|5.0|Harry Potter & The Prisoner of Azkaban is such a wonderful soundtrack for anyone that enjoys classical music. It has different varieties, such as swing, waltz, dramatic, energetic and all sorts. It really does tickle anyone's fancy. I received mine as a Christmas gift, and I love it so much. John Williams has once again composed another masterpiece. It fits the movie and the themes to a T. I would recommend this to ANYONE. Enjoy!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I've listened to a lot of green day in the past, and i did like them, but just passed them off as a band that i would listen to, but maybe not buy they're album. After \\"American Idiot\\" came out (the single), I really liked it, then \\"Blvd of broken dreams\\" was playing everywhere and i was so adddicted to the sound. So I went out and bought the album as soon as I could. I guess u can say i bought it for Blvd of broken dreams...but then i listened to every other song on the album, and they were just as awesome! The best song on there would be Jesus of suburbia and St. Jimmy. This album is kind of different from their other realeses, but its still got that vibe that green day's always had.  Now i guess you can say that i'm absolutley obsessed with them and listen to their album non-stop. If you have been living in a cave for the last year, then i guess u might not have heard of their new album, but if ur wanting really great music, this is the album to buy!!
B0002YLC24|1.0|I'm crazy about Richard Linklater's films except for this miniseries.   <br /> <br />Here are two people stumbling into a reunion after a one-night stand nine or ten years earlier.  It's Paris.  He's a writer; she works for an environmental organization.  Will they?  Won't they? <br /> <br />Sounds great! Sounds romantic!  Unfortunately these are two paper-thin, self-absorbed characters.  They just don't matter very much. The Paris they wander through is the Paris of paper postcards.  It won't, I promise, matter a whole lot whether they wind up together at the end except maybe they deserve each other! <br /> <br />High point:  a few seconds of Nina Simone singing \\"Just in Time\\" as the credits come up.
B00030590I|2.0|I liked Crouching Tiger a lot and thought that this movie might be along the same vein but was very disappointed. Although the action scenes were nice it gradually dawned on me that this movie is in fact a Chinese propaganda film. I am not sure whether it was the: <br /> <br />- Excessive use of red (which incidentally is the color of the Chinese flag and signifies the revolution) <br />- The various dialogs suggesting that assassins should desist since the emperor is trying to unite the country. Could this possibly suggest that the freedom fighters should desist so that the communist government can unite the country such that peace can prevail - I think so! I wonder what the people of Tibet think about the peace brought to them by the land grabbing activities of the People's Republic of China. Trust me, if you have lived in any country that has shared a border with China you know about the underhanded techniques the Chinese government uses to acquire as much land as it can.  <br />- The fact that the \\"Hero\\" was sacrificed in the end for the greater good of the empire; not unlike the many innocents that have been sacrificed along the way for the greater good of the modern day People's Republic of China <br /> <br />What is really sad however, is the fact that the makers of this film were able to market this film as a somewhat mainstream action film all the while feeding western audiences Chinese propaganda. The real icing for the producers of the film and the Chinese government is that people are paying to watch Chinese propaganda. Go ahead, be a sucker - I received my copy as gift and I will probably hawk it on eBay.  <br />
068987474X|5.0|This book basically throws in your face all the rotten stupid pathetic excuses we give for the jerks in our life and makes you realize that it's not \\"ok\\" to settle for crap and that it's better to alone then with someone and \\"lonely\\" ..The book hit home like no other and I recommend this book to any successful, talented, beautiful woman out there who is still asking herself why she keeps attracting losers and accepting less then what she deserves. You will realize that the excuses you've been given to these losers is a joke and that they aren't worth a second more of your time. Thanks Greg and Liz. I love Sex and the City and I LOVE your book! **I just found out that liz's cousin lives in my apt building in Brooklyn and sits next to me on the bus every day, how funny is that
0805066349|5.0|Its been over 30 years since _Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee_ was first published, yet it remains an authority on the history of the American West.<br /><br />Written from the Native People's perspective, Brown meticulously documents the conflicts and issues that eventually resulted in the forced settlement of Natives on reservations between 1860 and 1890.  In exploring the complexities of the issues, Brown does not fall into the trap of villifying \\"the white man\\" while \\"enobling\\" the Natives - while sympathetic to the Natives, punches are not pulled regarding actions by either side.  The history is much more complicated than a littany of broken promises and broken treaties.  The stories of such varied peoples as the Navajo, Apache, Ute, Cheyenne and Sioux, Kiowa and Puna have similar features in the conflicts these nations had with whites; yet the inter-generational conflicts within tribes and the unique circumstances between the federal government and Natives are also explored in detail.  The only criticism I have is its lack of maps to give readers a clearer idea of the areas discussed in detail in the text of the book.<br /><br />_Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee_ is an outstanding history that addresses many misconcpetions Americans have about the settlement of the West, while also serving as a reminder of the unpleasant nature and the costs involved in \\"winning the West.\\"
630575067X|1.0|This movie makes me sick to my stomach! Its horrible acting (Jake Lloyd is awful), rotten \\"cute\\" characters (that's you, Jar Jar), and the incredibly uninteresting story (what does the liberation of Naboo have to do with anything that happens in the original trilogy?) make me want to upchuck.<br /><br />First off is the acting. Who in the world saw any kind of potential in Jake Lloyd as the little Darth Vader?! He has got to be the worst actor in cinematic history. Some of the other actors also have a less than satisfactory and convincing way of getting their lines across on screen.<br /><br />Secondly I would like to mention Jar Jar. (Where in the world did George come up with the name Jar Jar anyway? It sounds like an unintelligible word an infant would mumble to himself.) He looks like a cross between a frog and a chicken. The way he talks is as stupid as (if not stupider than) he is, and every moment his ugly face comes on the screen I can't help but cringe.<br /><br />Lastly is the storyline. Wow, the Jedi go undercover to this beautiful planet called Naboo and free it from some weird, dopey droids. And during the fiasco they happen to have to land on Tatooine for repairs for their ship and meet Anakin Skywalker. What is the point of the entire Naboo story? Was it just put there because George Lucas couldn't think of anything better? I mean, come on. Couldn't they have done things a little better and more interestingly?<br /><br />This movie is NOT worth buying PERIOD. Heck, it's not even worth renting. Don't waste your time and money on it.
B000002J0B|5.0|With the House of the Holy album, Zeppelin pretty much abandoned their blues roots and went for a different sound with more keyboards than in the past.  Some would scorn them for this change of direction but I've always embraced this as being a great Zeppelin album.  To give you a better outlook on the album I'll review each song. <br /> <br />The Song Remains the Same- This song is full of energy but it gets a bit boring after you've heard it many times.  I still love it nonetheless though.  9/10 <br /> <br />The Rain Song- This has one of the most beautiful acoustic guitars I've ever heard in it.  This is a pretty long song and most of it is insturmental but I love every minute of it.  Very poetic lyrics.  9/10 <br /> <br />Over the Hills and Far Away-  The best acoustic riff ever. This is a great song and I never get tired of it.  Full of energy.  10/10 <br /> <br />The Crunge- I've heard this song bashed because it's so weird before but I personally like it.  It showed the Zeppelin had a funky side that liked to show in songs like this and the later \\"Trampled Underfoot\\".  8/10 <br /> <br />Dancing Days- This was one of the first Zeppelin songs I ever heard and it's still one of my favorites.  Awesome.  10/10 <br /> <br />D'Yer Mak'er- Zeppelin doing reggae! It's amazingly great.  This is my favorite song off the album definetely.  11/10 <br /> <br />No Quarter- This song has a really empty, creepy sort of feel to it but it's a really good song.  I'm not always in the mood to listen to it but when I do it's amazes me how good it is.  11/10 <br /> <br />The Ocean- This is a really great song...it always makes me want to sing along.  10/10
B00000K3CK|5.0|Many of us have seen Miracle on 34th Street many times (once a year), and for me it never wears out.  Just seeing Edmund Gwenn convince the sceptical, but adorable Natalie Wood that he's Santa is always both moving and hilarious.  The theme is that sometimes good (Gwenn) triumphs over evil (Sawyer) with a little luck and magic (unfortunately not this year though.)<br />  The way the plot is put into place is masterful and George Seaton's direction flawless.  Maureen O'Hara and John Payne (Gailey) do a great job and if you listen carefully you can hear O'Hara's Irish accent creep in.  Also great is the judge played by Gene Lockhart who gives his role just the right dash of comedy, as well as William Frawley (better known as Fred on I Love Lucy).<br />  The swipe it takes at psychiatry is too mild though.  It depicts Sawyer as a fake psychiatrist...not challenging the legitimacy of psychiatry itself.  However the message gets subtly through...there are those in the profession \\"with no humanity\\" as Kris Kringle puts it.<br />  Even though you know the outcome it's still great to watch the triumphant result of Gailey's efforts, as well as Kringle's winning over of everyone at the end.<br />  To me THIS is the quintessential Christmas film, not Wonderful Life or Christmas Carol which are too sentimental and dated.  Miracle is intelligent, human, and timeless.
B000002J03|5.0|This is probably my favorite Zeppelin album but instead of boring you with how much I like it I'm going to do one of those song by song reviews that I'm fond of. <br /> <br />Whole Lotta Love- This song is one of their most well-known ones and with good reason.  Everything about this track just screams awesome. 10/10 <br /> <br />What Is and What Should Never Be- This song is great.  The verses are so mellow and then you get that power packed chorus.  Robert Plant's vocals are outstanding. 9/10 <br /> <br />The Lemon Song- This song is actually sort of a rip-off of an old blues song but Zeppelin did that a lot so oh well.  I really love this song, it has a really cool guitar break in the middle of it too. 10/10 <br /> <br />Thank You- This is a sweet, acoustic love song...not much to say about it other than that.  It's good... 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Heartbreaker- This is my favorite Zeppelin riff of all time and my favorite song off this album.  The guitar solo in this is CRAZY! 11/10 <br /> <br />Living Loving Maid- This is sort of like the continuation of Heartbreaker only not quite as awesome.  It's classic though.  10/10 <br /> <br />Ramble On- Ah! I forgot about this one...this holds a flame up against Heartbreaker even.  They're pretty close for being my favorite off this album with this one in a slight 2nd I guess.  An awesome song...I like the Lord of the Rings theme in it.  11/10 <br /> <br />Moby Dick- All hail John Bonham! This is a great drum solo...RIP Bonzo 8/10 <br /> <br />Bring It On Home- This one starts out with Robert on the harmonica and then kicks in to a great guitar riff from Jimmy...it's a cool song and a great closer for one of the best albums of all time.  9/10
6305433909|1.0|The first Sister Act was great--You're supposed to see the movie, to get into the characters/storyline. I did that w/the first one. Not in this second--all I saw was the effort.<br /><br />The basic plot is the same as the first (\\"saving\\" the kids the way whoopi's character was \\"saved\\"; the mafia still chasing after whoopi's character).<br /><br />zzzzzzz.....<br /><br />Enjoy the first Sister Act and be happy. (btw--the kids don't sing. They do hiphop and rapping at the end of movie. Rapping, for those who don't know the difference, is not singing. Sorry folks!)
B00000HYXB|5.0|I can't even remember how I was first introduced to Blind Guardian but it was definetely an addiction from the first time I heard the epicness of their music and the weirdness of Hansi's vocals...Blind Guardian rocks, no questions about it.  So after hearing Blind Guardian for the first time I decided to go get Nightfall in Middle-Earth.  So what did I think of this album? That's easy, I thought exactly what any person in the right mind would...that this was one of the coolest things since sliced bread of course!  Anyone who is willing to deny Nightfall in Middle-Earth of it's greatness is a complete and utter idiot.  So for the rest of you sane people in the world go buy this CD and let Blind Guardian lead through the epic story of Tolkien's Simirillian (a book that I've tried to read in the past but got bored with even though Blind Guardian makes it so interesting that I might try to read it again).  You will not be disappointed by investing in this and if you are then someone needs to show you to the nearest asylum.   <br /> <br />My personal favorite tracks include- Into the Storm (an awesome, fast song), Nightfall (great chorus in this), Mirror Mirror (another fast one and very well done), Time Stands Still At the Iron Hill and Thorns (these were the songs that introduced me to Blind Guardian I think)...actually this whole album just rocks.  Trying to pick favorite songs is crazy.  Just buy it, dont question why, just buy it.
B00003CXXS|5.0|I know this movie wasn't directed by Spielberg but it is still just as good as the two prior to it. This is because it has amazing special effects that surpass the first two by far and also because it has a very gripping story line. This film is also helped by the great music composed by Don Davis.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I didn't really expect much when I got this DVD.  Led Zeppelin is my favorite band of all time though so I figured that this is the best I could get to actually seeing them live.  My low expectations where completely blown away by this however.  At first I was still skeptical as I popped in the 2nd disk first and instantly noticed the choppiness of the editing of Immigrant's Song but I was quickly proved wrong.  This is really a great DVD with around 5 hours of play.  Anyone who likes Led Zeppelin will be able to appreciate this and for those of you who dont' like Zeppelin, seeing the band perform on stage might be all you need to make you a fan.  Anyone who is ignorant and wants to tell me that Led Zeppelin only had one good song (Stairway to Heaven) and were a bunch of one hit wonders need to buy this DVD set and look at the giant audiences of excited fans.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|From the outside Elf looks like it could be another bizzare, possibly crude comedy (even though it is targeted towards a family audience).  The biggest reason being is that the lead star (Will Farrell) has in the past done crude raunchy comedies taht typically are for an adult audience.  Well Farrell places his comedic trade here and unleashes a destined classic.<br /><br />Elf is about Buddy, a young orphon who when very little snuck into Santa's sack one christmas.  From there he was taken to the North Pole where upon discovery Sana decided to let a high Elf (Bob Newhart) raise him.  Flash forward 30 years later and Buddy is now a grown adult.  Santa and the high elf decide that it is time for Buddy to go to the human world and find his real father (James Caan).  So Buddy sets off on a grand adventure to find his Father (who is less than thrilled to meet him).  Along the way he becomes a member of the family, falls in love, and spreads Christmas cheer to all of New York City.<br /><br />Overall this is a funny classic movie that while not necisarrily explores the depths of what Will Farrell can do, utilizes his talents in a nice clean family movie that is in no way offensive and sticks to what it wants to be, a family Christmas Movie.
0676974120|4.0|Yum, just got this for Christmas. Only two quibbles so far. One, unlike my edition of How to Eat and How to be a Domestic Goddess this one is all in weights. Bother. I wish they would either be bilingual so to speak, or be in volumes for the North American market. I lived in England for years and never could get to grips with weights. No. 2 gripe is that I wish she wasn't so dismissive of vegetarian food. I don't eat meat, and don't begrudge her her beast. I'd like to see her give it a go.<br />Other than that, her writing is great as always, comfy, yet to the point. Nigella is always relateable, and I like that. The recipes mostly look great, though a few more hmms than usual (sweet potatoes with marshmallow - eeewwww). Hopefully deep fried peanut butter and banana sandwiches are not forthcoming. Finally, it was good to see her have a few more Jewish recipes. She always seems deeply (and puzzlingly) closeted about this.
0486437507|5.0|HP Lovecraft was heavily inspired by Chambers' wierd tales from _The King in Yellow_.  (He stole the name and vague concept of Hastur from it.)  The frustrating thing about RW Chambers is that he COULD write very well, but for some reason he usually didn't.  At his best he could weave an atmosphere of terrifying hallucinatory brilliance.  At his worst he was hokey, sentimental, sappy, and tiresome.  Half of his original _The King in Yellow_ consists of dopey romance stories that will infuriate the wierd fiction fan.  Not so here.  This Dover collection has only the best tales from _The King in Yellow_, as well as a number of other chilling morsels picked from Chambers' large body of later (mostly forgettable) work. <br />You should get hold of this collection just for \\"The Repairer of Reputations,\\" which ranks as a superior masterpiece of surreal paranoid delirium.  It's one of the top 5 wierd stories of all time, and actually BETTER than anything by Lovecraft.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I would,, I got it, it's nerd madness... and I did not like it. But for some reason I watched it all the way to the crappy marrage sceen at the end,, I don't know why, I wouldn't watch it again though and thats how I rate movies. This is overated schlock. (if it's based in the 70s which set direction and feel make it feel then what the hell is with the internet and messaging a black woman that would in my opinion have nothing to do with this guy) Now if the lead actors is like that in real life it's even more schlock. If he is completely opposite he should get an oscar because completely boring films always win. Who wins this guy or Jamie Fox in Collateral!?.. this is sundance at it's finest,, Now blockbuster had a whole wall full of them and only 3 Stander DVDs which I found much more entertaining...!!!
B000005H40|5.0|John Coltrane's musical evolution was at a pivotal point when this recording was made. This music is more accessible and grounded in hard bop than what was to come and yet there are moments included of absolute brilliance. Coltrane and the group assembled for this session created something of lasting value. Lee Morgan is incredible and Kenny Drew can wander in and out of the blues smoothly as anyone. This is a fine CD that should not be missed. Coltrane was on his way to creating some musical masterpieces and this may not be on the same plane as some of his later more experimental recordings but it is nonetheless a significant and important record that belongs in your collection.
0380977788|5.0|I'm adding Coraline to my list of all time favorite books.  I loved it!  It was definitely weird but great fun.  I continue to think about it weeks after having read it.  I am a fourth grade teacher who knows some highly imaginative children who might also greatly enjoy it!
0793509602|2.0|I must say I've only been playing guitar for a little over two years. This book has not been helpful to me in any way. The other reviews about needing about 1 year of is experience are wrong, I could have pulled this off easily right away, because the book moves at such a slow pace anyway. This book will only teach you the basic pentatonic and minor scales, I wouldn't recommend it for a player with a lot of experience, but it would be a great book for beginners! *Note: Do not get this book if you have an acoustic guitar, and not an electric!*
B0002ZMJ5M|5.0|A blend of old and new songs....all recorded new for this album. I found myself loving eevry song. Ian's voice is really good and you can tell he cared to make this as strong a personal performance as possible. This is one of those \\"solo\\" Ian projects that had the rest of the band chip in later. No matter, as with any good Tull album, it starts and end with the quality of Mr. Anderson's voice, flute and accoustic guitar, and then gets the \\"warm wrapper\\" from Matin and Co. A must have Tull album - don't let the title turn you off - the theme is Christmas - and it'a a little better with JT.
B00005JNBQ|3.0|I liked this movie, because it is so realistic and different.  The main character, Napoleon Dynamite, is hilarious and so is his brother Kip (whose attitude is sexy). The only complaint that I had was the timing.  There were very large chunks of time that nothing really happened, and there really isn't a plot. The story seemed a bit drawn out and thin, too. On the other hand it stands out from other comedies in its originality and focus on detail.  Just looking at John Heder,(Napoleon)is enough to make you laugh.  My favorite scene, is the one where he is thirsty and sweaty from dancing in his room! Final say: You have to develop a taste for this one.
B00000K3D4|4.0|At first glance, Labyrinth is nothing but a cheesy kid film. Don't glance just once. There's more to it than that. Sarah represents everyone, getting forced to face their own maze of the mind to find peace, learning that growing up means more growing inward, letting go of pettiness than necessarily relinquishing what one loves.  The music, except for Chilly Down, is excellent. Even if you can't stand David Bowie music, Underground, As the World falls down, Magic Dance, and Within you will win your heart.  Memorable lines are all through it- What is your basis for comparison? Only forever, not long at all.  Such a pity. And it is- such a pity that the \\"romance'' is as doomed as the Phantom and Christine's. A second, equally important lesson is one that runs through all of GL's movies- help comes from the most unlikely sources- instead of hapless droids, Wookies, ewoks, etc, you have a dwarf, Don Quixote in canine form, and Ludo. But Hogwart, er Hoggle is much nicer than Jar Jar.
0385484518|4.0|Have you ever had that one person that changed your life?  Have you ever had a role model teacher to look up to?  Of course you have.  Mine was Mr. Bailey, my eleventh grade history teacher.  He put such power and emotion into his teaching.  I still have not forgotten him or the lessons he taught me. <br /> <br />Tuesdays with Morrie is a book of this nature.  It talks about the relationship between Mitch and his sociology professor Morrie.  Mitch and Morrie have always been close, ever since he started taking his classes at school.  Before long, Mitch graduates and moves on with his life and for a time forgets about his teacher.  Mitch made a promise to keep in touch, but understandably we all get busy in our lives.  Similar to the lot of us, we get wrapped up in our own person pursuits that we forget to stay in touch with those people that have helped us along life's journey. <br /> <br />Flipping though the channels one day, Mitch discovers that Ted Koppel is doing an interview with his old professor.  By now, Morrie has the dreaded a terminally ill disease and the newscaster is doing a segment on him.  This sparks Mitch's memory of his promise to keep in touch.  Mitch, after seeing the broadcast, immediately flies down to visit his sick friend. <br /> <br />Morrie is an interesting fellow.  He is very open with his emotions, prone to cry, and does not hold anything back from anyone.  He is really in touch with his sensitive side and is not afraid to show it.  He has a deep love for mankind.  He fights the disease to the very end, and Mitch will be there every Tuesday to engage in a meaningful conversation with him before he passes on.  Mitch and Morrie set up appointments every Tuesday to discuss a variety of topics ranging from forgiveness to money to the perfect day.  Morrie offers his insights and Mitch tapes the conversations.  Every week Morrie's condition gets worse and their last conversation is about passing on and dying. <br /> <br />I know this book did change a lot of lives and I know that Mitch Albom puts his heart into it.  As nonfiction goes, it isn't bad.  I didn't find it emotionally overwhelming.  It is not the best book ever written about the subject of death.  It has numerous clichs.  The writing style is fairly simple.  The story is borderline sappy and sentimental at times. <br /> <br />However, I would have to be a hard hearted grinch not to recommend this book.  It is not extremely profound, but it does serve as a good reminder that we need to care more about those in our lives, that we need to put forth the extra effort to make life worthwhile. <br /> <br />I know that Morrie would be a fascinating person to meet.  People like him do make the world a better place, as common as that phrase is used.  I liked this book, but I didn't love it.  At times, it creates emotion that runs through us and at times you almost laugh because it can be so sappy. <br /> <br />I recommend for you to give it a try and possibly it could have a more lasting effect on you than it did on me.  I don't regret reading Tuesdays with Morrie; it was a pleasant couple of hours well spent one evening.  Certainly better than turning on the T.V. or other mindless things we sometimes do.  It also helped serve as a gentle reminder that I also could do better in my own life. <br /> <br />Grade: B <br />
B0000067X1|5.0|This is one of the most psychedelic albums I've ever heard. These Germans knew how to mess with your head, they recorded this masterpiece in their own makeshift studio(an old abandoned movie theater)and with almost complete creative control and came up with one of the weirdest and most delightful progressive/psychedelic recordings ever. The songs vary from primal funky beat oriented cuts to long and creepy synth and guitar workouts that seem to frighten as much as amaze. Damo Suzuki's vocals are terrific, they range from soft cooing to raw chantings and evil ravings. The drumming is also nothing short of phenomenal, for once a psychedelic record totally utilizes the use of the drums, most albums of this genre opt for long soloing of the guitar and organ but Can also put their  magnificent drummer Jaki Liebezeit to work and the drums flow evenly with the rest of the instruments, sometimes over taking them enitrely and becoming the centerpiece of the song. Can are seeminly more influenced by classical composers than they are the Chuck Berry rock and roll pop song format. All manner of studio effects are heard, from guitar reverb to eerie synth lines that skitter and echo all around. \\"Aumgn\\" could easily be the score to a horror film. Anyways, if you want a great krautrock/psychedelic rock album than this is definitley it.
0385508417|3.0|The book and the new 2004 movie 'Christmas with the Kranks', a faithful portrayal of John Grisham's novel, are both recommended for all ages.<br /><br />Luther and Nora Krank's decision to skip Chritmas for one year, much to the chagrin of their local festive-spirited community and friends sets the scene for this light hearted short story where not all the cranks are called Krank.<br /><br />Is Luther the new Scrooge of Christmas or does that title belong to those who pressure him to spend on Christmas rather than take a Carribean cruise instead? Is there too much commercialism of Christmas? Can children expect too much of their parents? Is catering for a grown-up daughter's whim reason enough to change holiday plans or does that indicate what a family is all about? Are demanding neighbours wanting a community spirit beyond the pale or integral to what a community is all about?<br /><br />There are a number of questions to the subtle sub-plots of this novel and certainly the true spirit of Christmas -giving- is ultimately revealed by Luther's generous actions and his acceptance of family bonds.<br /><br />The movie of the book has some gorgeous snow scenes and shots of attractive suburban homes festooned with Christmas lights as well as some some humorous moments. Tim Allen (Luther) clearly enjoys making Christmas movies and is well supported by Jamie Lee Curtis(Nora).
B0006399FS|5.0|This is a CD worthy of U2, though not quite as ambitious or groundbreaking as their several prior works.  It may not be as good as their prior release, All That You Can't Leave Behind, for some reason it has spent a lot more time in my CD player than that acknowledged classic.  It's because of Edge's guitar playing and the production which brings it to life.  They sound like a rock band, like they do live, and that connects with any audience.      The sound of this record is mainstream U2.  The experimentation of the 1990's is largely absent, as is the folk/country/blues sounds of Joshua Tree and ATYCLB.  Here's a track by track review. I've included B-sides, because frankly they should've made the final cut.    Here are the tracks that are worth putting on your i-pod:    'Vertigo' (can you think of a better U2 rocker?)  Fast Cars (a hypnotic, flamenco influenced b-side that should've made the final cut).  This is more of the experimental side of U2 that should've made it to the final cut.  'Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own' (Edge's guitar playing makes this ballad go).  'All Because of You' (a great rocking tune).  Edge and Adam Clayton's ability to take a standard rock song and do interesting things with the bass and guitar sounds is what sets U2 and all the post-punk bands apart from mainstream contemporaries.    'Crumbs From Your Table' - very underrated.  Showcases the band's sound.  They should've repeated the 'cool down mama' part in the second verse, however.    'City of Blinding Lights' -  a crowd favorite that packs the emotion and sound of the old U2 with the writing, production and guitar playing of today.  A great track.  'Original of the Species' - hate the lyrics, and hate the version on this CD.  The live version that appears on a DVD and also appeared on an ipod ad however, rocks. Download that one.  'Love Peace or Else' - reminiscent of Bullet the Blue Sky (though not quite as good).  They created a great sound for Edge on this one.    'Yahweh' - reminscent of the Unforgettable Fire days.  A nice song to sing along to.  The live performances of this track are outstanding.  'Miracle Drug' - This one I initially liked but have grown tired of.  'Fast Cars' would've been a better choice.  'Neon Lights' - a b-side.  A mellow, piano driven track that reminds one of the October days.    I've omitted some tracks, but in short, it's a solid, though not great CD.  Yet, the sound of this record is fantastic and it makes you want to hear it more and more.
B00005JLKN|5.0|The BEST suspense thriller ever commited to celluloid, period. This has always been my personal favorite of the 'Lector' chronicles- mainly because the emphasis is not on the infamous doctor, but the far more terrifying and psychologically realistic character of Francis Dolarhyde, and the other side of that coin; the equally fascinating inspector Graham. Much has been made of the original adaptation; 'MANHUNTER'- while I agree that version (directed by the great Michael Mann) has a certain stylistic superiority, not to mention fine performances by William Peterson, Tom Noonan, and Brian Cox (actually a better Lector, in my humble opinion)- This version is much more faithful to the novel, with Dolarhyde's and Reba's relationship being the central issue, and the mythology and origion of 'THE DRAGON' intact. Emily Watson easily outshines Joan Allen, Norton is servicable, and Fiennes is a brillant Dolarhyde, inspiring both pity and terror, as we watch him struggle with the voices commanding him to kill for his 'becoming'. Don't see this without reading the book!!
B00003CX8I|5.0|Humanity is at a crossroads. Evolution has reared its head. There are human beings in the world today with extraordinary gifts and powers. These powerful beings are called \\"mutants.\\" And their existence scares some people.<br /><br />In the United States, Senator Robert Kelly has introduced legislation that will require all mutants to \\"register\\" as such. He feeds the fear by telling his peers, and the public, some of what he's heard these mutants can do.<br /><br />Two of the most powerful mutants, Professor Charles Xavier (Professor X), and his old friend, Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto), have different agendas of how best to deal with humanity's intolerance of mutants.<br /><br />The Professor believes that patience is a virtue in this case. Humanity will come around eventually, he believes. In the meantime, he has established a \\"School for the Gifted,\\" where he teaches his students how to control and master their powers for the good of humanity.<br /><br />Magneto, on the other hand, believes that a war between humans and mutants is inevitable. Instead of waiting for it to happen, however, he wants to go on the offensive. If it's a war humans want, it's a war they will get. One way or the other, Magneto will see to it that the mutant race is the only race that survives.<br /><br />That, in a nutshell, is all you need to know before going to see this movie, though you could really no nothing at all and not have to worry. \\"X-Men\\" does an excellent job of setting the stage for those viewers who no nothing of the world of mutants.<br /><br />The X-Men universe has been around for a very long time, with several incarnations in both the comic book and cartoon series world. Each incarnation has its own version of the struggle between humanity and mutants, as well as its own telling of the backgrounds of the characters. There is a very rich history to draw from, with a possible cast of hundreds of mutants to draw from.<br /><br />One of the reasons I liked this movie so much is that director Bryan Singer didn't try to introduce too many mutants all at once. Although long-time mutant lovers would have loved it, novice mutant viewers would have been too overwhelmed to follow the story. Instead, the main storyline was limited to just a handful of mutants (Professor X, Magneto, Rogue, Wolverine, Storm, Cyclops, Dr. Jean Grey, Sabertooth, Toad, and Mystique). However, he also treated long time X-Men fans to a glimpse of many other mutant favorites (including Iceman, Pyro, Jubilee, and Kitty to name a few).<br /><br />I also thought the casting of this movie was near perfection. Patrick Stewart (Star Trek: The Next Generation) made such a great Professor X that you almost begin to think that the comic book character was originally written with him in mind. Ian McKellan (Lord of the Rings) as Magneto was also a great choice. Fanke Janssen (Dr. Jean Grey), Anna Paquin (Rogue), and Rebecca Romijn (Mystique) were also very well choices.<br /><br />However, my favorite casting decision has got to be Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. I don't know who it was that saw the potential he had to play this part, but it was very much the right call. Of all the characters, the casting of Wolverine is the one that could have broken the entire movie for long time X-Men fans. Thankfully, Jackman was the perfect choice and we were treated to a great portrayal.<br /><br />I know some long time X-Men fans were disappointment that his or her favorite mutant did not make it into the movie. However, there is great potential for not only more X-Men movies (at the time of this review, X2: X-Men United has already been released and pre-production work is currently in progress for X-Men 3), but also for more specialized mutant movies focusing on one, two, or three mutants at a time (right now, rumors are circulating about a movie featuring Wolverine and one featuring Storm). If done correctly, this franchise can last for many, many years.<br /><br />The original VHS version alsocomes with three extras that are rare of videos: 8 deleted scenes, an interview with director Bryan Singer, and animated storyboards.<br /><br />Boiled down: \\"X-Men\\" has terrific action, great special effects, good casting, a solid plot, and is a lot of fun. I truly recommend that you add this to your movie collection.ginal VHS version also comes with three extras that are rare of videos: 8 deleted scenes, an interview with director Bryan Singer, and animated storyboards. <br /> <br />Boiled down: \\"X-Men\\" has terrific action, great special effects, good casting, a solid plot, and is a lot of fun.

1573228737|4.0|\\"Affinity\\" is a very good book, but not as much a tour de force as Waters' other two, \\"Tipping the Velvet\\" and \\"Fingersmith,\\" both of which are broader in plot development and richer in detail.  The two historical wells from which Waters draws material for \\"Affinity,\\" namely, the women's prison system in Victorian England and the Spiritualist movement of the same period, are by definition specific and limited.  Where \\"Tipping..\\" and \\"Fingersmith\\" are epic in scope as well as overflowing with strong characterizations, \\"Affinity\\" is a close, intimate, psychological portrait of a few individuals brought together in oppressive, stifling circumstances.  By definition, \\"Affinity\\" is not a book which fills the reader with large, grand emotions and ideas.  But it is, like its counterparts, an artfully written piece of English historical fiction, impeccably well-researched and sensitive to the issues of gender and class that inform all of Ms. Waters' work.  It also contains other elements that will be familiar to Ms. Waters' readers - lesbian themes, either overt or implied; plot twists (here, a particularly juicy and unexpected ending); the juxtaposition of dual narratives; explorations of good and evil; and the alienation of women in patriarchal society - all held together by evocative descriptions that nail the reader visually and viscerally to the spot and hold you there.  The descriptions of prison life are harrowing, tragic, gripping, brutal, and, unfortunately, based on hard research.  This alone makes for a devastating and intense read. <br /> <br />\\"Affinity\\" starts slowly, and tried my patience for about the first 100 pages.  I offer this comment to encourage the potential reader to stick with the book, because it will improve.  I ended up reading the last 250 pages in one sitting, having been completely taken in.  Once you fully enter the world of the two narrators, you will need to know how it turns out, and it will not be what you expected.  Given the fact thatMs. Waters is such an exceptionally fine writer, when I say that \\"Affinity\\" is not the best of her works, still, it is a first-class piece of fiction nonetheless.  (And, by the way, if you are expecting to be titillated by lesbian erotica or pornography, you have most definitely come to the wrong place.)  Recommended. <br />
B000002QWD|5.0|I'm a kinda old dude, I guess. I remember in '49 as a little boy when My mom & dad went Christmas shopping and bought the 10 inch LP version of this Crosby classic. I've played it every year since for all those decades, even though it is now worn out. <br /> <br />Every time I play the current cd version, I am stunned by the feelings and memories it conjures up of times that, in many ways, were much more wholesome and meaningful than they are now. Memories of the smell of a christmas tree, the sight of the bubble lights twinkling away and of a Santa soon to be here. And these songs just bring it all to life. Really indescribable, but oh, so wonderful! To this day, it's the one album that will rekindle that old Christmas spirit. <br /> <br />Bing was an absolute master of his craft back when this album was made and John Scott Trotter's orchestrations were to Bing what Nelson Riddle was to Sinatra - perfect! <br /> <br />There's no point in reiterating the performances of these superb songs. That's been done a million times already. I just wish they'd remaster the songs so that they are sonically what they were in '49 rather than the somewhat harsh electronic enhancements they have embellished them with for so many years now. <br /> <br />But ultimately, it makes no difference because it is the music that is important and, for my money, this is the finest Christmas album ever made and will be the best $5 investment you will ever make!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I must say, there is no special effects in this movie, no known actors, no real moral to the story or anything that would make you want to read a novel version of this plot.  That said, I must say this is my favorite movie of 2004, and quite possibly the best movie of 2004.  The beauty of this movie is the fact that it didn't have to rely on any special effects, turn in plots or points it was trying to make with the viewer.  This movie is pure genius.  My uncle hated this movie.  After many viewings and a lot of thought I can come to only one conclusion why.  He is shallow and close minded.  If you don't have a broud sense of humor, or appreciation for every little thing that make a movie great, then you better skip this one.  Jon Heder (the actor who played Napoleon) is not like this in real life, in fact he's married and quite down to earth.  In this movie you never once find him even close to out of character.  Yeah this isn't a drama, but the acting it incredible.  The whole cast is convincing to the point that you forget they are acting and in your mind you can't picture them any other way.  This is one of the most original films I have ever seen.  I love everything about it.  It's back to the basics film making with this movie, like when movies had to rely on acting and a great script, not like many of todays over priced CG reliant films that are so common these days.  Pick this dvd up, its full of great extras that fans of the movie will enjoy.  Bottom line, this movie will make you fit your nun chucks back in your locker.
B0002WZTOI|4.0|Who can deny the wonderful edition process and set up in this picture ? But seen in sincere perspective the film seems to be a video clip of long duration. The presence of the ever-smiling and inexpressive Tom Cruise with his partner Kelly Mc Gillis reveals an absolute presence of sexual chemistry . It is a film without dramatic structure and you feel the rest of the dialogue is forced to show the aerial gun fights and the overwhelming acrobatic scenes to satisfy a furious audience in that decade hunger for the magic of the Video Clips.<br />However Anthony Edwards stole the show  , Val Kilmer and Meg Ryan in their ascending careers .<br />Do not search a profound drama . It is absent . But it is a feast for your senses . Good entertainment for the family.
0792844890|5.0|Spaceballs, the Mel Brooks spoof of Star Wars and Star Trek, met all the expectations Mel Brooks set out for.  Spaceballs is humorous.  Sure, the plot wasn't great, but you quickly forget about that with sidesplitting notions such as John Candy in a dog suit and a giant hairdryer.  If you want a movie that involves a lot of thinking, Spaceballs isn't for you.  However, if you want a comedy that you can sit down and watch anytime, I recommend Spaceballs.
B00063EMJG|1.0|This won't take long. Just a few simple questions: What's the point Neil? Are these songs great? No question about it, like a hundred more you have written. So what? Is the remastering good? Yeah. I guess. So? Do you need the money? No. Everybody knows that recording companies go for the money and nothing else, but I guess that's pretty obvious. But that's also not the case here. As far as I'm concerned, Neil himself did the deal in this case. A bad deal. A dirty one. Shame on you. PS: WE STILL LOVE YOU AND ALWAYS WILL. Do your fans an act of love: Put your whole catalog (or great part of it) in the hands of Rhino Records. They'll do the rest. PS: If I missed the point Neil, please forgive me.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|Elf is a cute bit of fluff  about a human orphan (Buddy) who grows up as a the foster son of an elf at the North Pole. Will Ferrell  stars as the tights-wearing, permed elf, Buddy. Bob Newhart  stars as his foster father and James Caan stars as his biological father. When Buddy has difficulty making his quota of toys, he begins to question himself. Overhearing from some of the other workers that he's really a human and NOT an elf, he decides to go to the real city to find his biological father.<br /><br />I really liked most of Elf, with the exception of two things: there were a few 'sophomoric humor scenes such as when Buddy is eating used chewing gum off the rail in the subway in New York, and scenes where Buddy is eating spaghetti with maple syrup. (Gag). And the rather annoying message that: Biological fathers are somehow superior to adopted fathers. I was disappointed that after Buddy found his biological father he ditched his elf dad and and wanted to become human. Say what? I wish Hollywood wouldn't perpetuate this myth that biology is somehow better than adopted parents. (Sigh).<br /><br />Other than those minor peeves, this was a cute funny movie sure to please the kiddies or the kids at heart.
B000001G89|5.0|I received this from my father for Christmas. I was nervous at first because of all the albums I had sampled, Theresa Berganza was my LEAST favorite. However, having listened to this recording thoroughly, I quite enjoy the entire cast. Berganza's singing is quite lovely and passionate in most songs, although I found her Habanera a little lacking. Domingo, of course, is wonderful. Yvonne Kenny, Alicia Nafe, Gordon Sandison, and Geoffrey Pogson (the four smugglers) are BRILLIANT! The quintet is very well done, and the blend of their voices is very pleasant to the ear. I would highly suggest this album to anyone who's looking for a quality recording of the opera as Bizet originally intended it to be heard: With the original dialogue (not those wretched added in recitatives, etc) and with a quality cast and orchestra. Kudos to Claudio Abbado and the cast.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|Collateral stars Jamie Foxx as the meek dreamer cabby Max. Tom Cruise stars as a hitman named Victor. When Max gives a free cab ride to a beautiful woman, his next rider turns out to be Victor, the lovable but-oh-so-evil killer for hire. Can Max grow a spine and escape Victor or will he become just another of Victor's victims? I really enjoyed Collateral, despite some initial misgivings after seeing the trailer. Max was an endearing character and a loveable loser. Victor was funny, and despite being a killer had some spot-on advice for Victor. I particularly liked the scene where Max was forced to impersonate Victor at the club.<br /><br />There were a few minor peeves (such as the rather stupid chase scene at the end), in which the two lead characters failed to elude Victor (Yeah right), and a few scenes just showing them in the cab driving around town doing nothing which could've been edited out.<br /><br />Overall, a fast fun film sure to please action fans!
0679720200|5.0|The basic problem of The Stranger is  <br />alienation.  Meursalt kills a man, but <br />doesn't feel sorry for killing him.   <br />Why not?  Is it because his mother died  <br />a few days earlier?  Is it because of  <br />his refusal to believe in God?  May it  <br />just be that his life is utterly meaningless?  <br />Those who read the afterword in the Penguin  <br />edition of The Stranger (The Outsider)  <br />must consider the author's explanation -  <br />'So one wouldn't be far wrong in seeing  <br />the The Outsider as the story of a man who,  <br />without any heroic pretentions, agrees to  <br />die for the truth.' 'The Stranger doesn't  <br />mean anything' is a lie.  Why? Meursalt <br />doesn't think so.  Secondly, Albert Camus <br />doesn't think so.  And thirdly, the  <br />reviewer doesn't think so.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I thought this would be a good movie showing ALL the details of 911 not just from one stand point. As in any situation there are three sides of the story. Thiers, ours, and the full truth. I bought the DVD to watch and ended up burning it in the fire. Not because of the content more because of our men and women fighting over there. Like stated \\"This is another Vietnam\\" My father was in that war and I thank god every day that he came home to me only to have people calling him a baby killer. COME ON PEOPLE. we need to support our men and women in any way needed and let them know we stand behind them and give them out stength. Peace to all and prayers to brother and sisters of war may god walk with you.
B00023B1LC|5.0|This is suspense at its best . . . no gore, no over-the-top cursing, no silly easily-solved story line.  We watch this over and over, especially when we want to sit and be entertained by a suspense movie that doesn't try too hard to be something it's not . . . I especially loved the \\"heroine.\\"  I liked the fact that they cast someone who wasn't a known name.  She felt very real to me, and I could see why Bourne and she would hang onto each other.  The farmhouse scenes were lovely, too . . . made me want to go to France in winter.  Really good story.
B0000020C4|5.0|Although I am not really knowledgeable in the performances of different Eponines I thought that Lea Salonga did a fantastic job.  This is one of the best performances that I have heard.  The duets with Colm Wilkinson (Jean Valjean) and Philip Quast are absolutely stunning.  After their performances together I cannot even listen to another man try and sing the part of Javert.  I believe that Quast pulled it off with so much of the character in the song.  The song 'Stars' is my favorite and brings me to tears sometimes.  All in all I loved this soundtrack and would suggest to any who are interested in Les Miserables to check it out.
B000687M48|4.0|From [...]<br /><br />Break out band Evanscence have released their first live DVD entitled \\"Anywhere But Home\\". This piece follows up their award-winning release \\"Fallen\\". The lineup consists of Amy Lee (vocals) along with Rocky Gray (drums), John LeCompt & Terry Balsamo (guitars) and William Boyd (bass). From the initial recordings of Evanescence, Amy Lee is the only remaining member and principal songwriter. Guitarist/co-Founder Ben Moody left mid tour last year. The DVD comes with a companion CD of the same concert, given you a double shot for the dollar.<br /><br />Given the high costs of CD's these days, I feel it was a smart thing to include both the video of the concert and the audio in the same package. Releasing them on separate packages can risk the fan purchasing both. It also eliminates gimmicks by giving you a little more. Not two releases each with one different track on it like a popular \\"new punk\\" band just did. As a matter of fact this live concert features every track from the CD \\"Fallen\\" with the exception of \\"Hello\\". There is a new track entitled \\"Missing\\" which is quite good.<br /><br />Shot on tour in Paris, the footage is done very well and at times is very dramatic. The levels of the sound across all members of the band and the vocals are clean and nothing overpowers one another. I have heard this as a live criticism of the band from some folks who had attended shows in the recent past. None of that is an issue on the DVD. I did notice that the band is only shown in very brief shots as opposed to Miss Lee. Clearly she is running the show at this point, and they are just the band behind her. It is difficult to assume otherwise based on the shooting done. There are a lot of close-ups to Amy and she is dressed in her typical Gothic style. Seeing her in this attire when playing the piano acoustically adds to the dramatics of the show.<br /><br />The entire concert is well-done but of course the groups signature tracks of \\"Bring Me To Life\\", \\"My Immortal\\", and \\"Going Under\\" will be the fan favorites. I also enjoyed \\"Tourniquet\\" and \\"Missing\\" quite a bit. I felt it was a bit better than I had expected, since not all of the bands one hears on the radio sound very good live. Evanescence has proven that they can hold their own onstage. I do wish for the future that less of the tape loops are used, as there are a couple of pieces where you hear Amy singing and the recorded voice is not her doing it at that same second. There is not much of a booklet inside and only one band photo. That could have been done a little better.<br /><br />As is becoming more and more common, the band has added their videos to this portion of the release as well. On the DVD you will find the video for \\"My Immortal\\", \\"Everybody's Fool\\", \\"Bring Me To Life\\" and \\"Going Under\\". Personally I like when the bands do this, as it saves you from hunting the music channels for the videos, or downloading them.<br /><br />Given the demise of Creed, Evanescence holds the record labels banner on high and stands to replace them as their key moneymaker. Whether they will hold on to this is anyone's guess. Their second studio CD will need to expand upon the successful themes of their first record and also provide a level of hits that Creed was able to deliver on most occasions. This DVD/CD package is a good pick for any fan of the band, or someone who would like to watch a good concert shoot.Life\\", \\"My Immortal\\", and \\"Going Under\\" will be the fan favorites.

B00000G3PA|4.0|I'll tell you what he's talking about - great sci fi action, Baby!<br /><br />There's been a lot of \\"uh oh, the world is about to end\\" movies in the past decade, but this is the best one. Bruce Willis is great in the lead role and the rest of the cast are all great, too.<br /><br />The story and great action scenes had me on the edge of my seat. Also, even though I usually don't like love stories thrown into action movies, I enjoyed the one in this between Liv Tyler and Ben Stiller.<br /><br />All in all, this is a totally great movie. You're really missing out if you haven't seen it.

B0006284JQ|5.0|First of all, I am disgusted with all the reviews by those Britney haters. I mean, it's just ridiculous how they hate her so much, but have bought the cd and write an individual review on every single song...I'm also disturbed on how some people even want her to die...Don't you guys have a life? If you hate her so much, then stop spending time on her! For who are you writing those reviews anyways? Britney fans are not gonnna listen to you... <br /> <br />Anyways, I thought the cd was great even though I didn't think I was gonna buy it because what I really wanted was the dvd (which I don't have.) This is how I rate the songs: <br /> <br />MY PREROGATIVE: 4/5 - I  would've liked this song more if she actually sang more because it just seems as if she's talking throught the whole song, but the beat is awesome and it also sends a good message. I like it more than Bobby Brown's original. <br /> <br />TOXIC: 5/5 Awesome song. I liked it since the first time I heard it and I won't get tired of it. <br /> <br />I'M A SLAVE 4 U: 5/5 - Great song! First song that had a more hip-hop beat. <br /> <br />OOPS!...I DID IT AGAIN: 5/5 - This song is definitely a pop classic! <br /> <br />ME AGAINST THE MUSIC: 4/5 - I liked it the first time I heard it, but now it is the song I skip. <br /> <br />STRONGER: 5/5 - My favorite song from the Oops album <br /> <br />EVERYTIME: 5/5 - Great ballad. Not one of my favorites, but I love it. <br /> <br />...BABY ONE MORE TIME: 5/5 - Another classic! Loved it since the first time, will always love it. <br /> <br />(YOU DRIVE ME) CRAZY (THE STOP REMIX!): 5/5 - Really good pop song. Much better than the original version. <br /> <br />BOYS (CO-ED REMIX): 4/5 - I like this song. It's more hip-hop than the original, but I like it more. <br /> <br />SOMETIMES: 4/5 - Cute song, but it's a little too long. It would be perfect without the last chorus loops and fade out at the end. <br /> <br />OVERPROTECTED (DARKCHILD REMIX): 5/5 - Another more hip-hopsong. I like it a lot, but I can't decide if I like it better than the original version. <br /> <br />LUCKY: 5/5 - Really good song. Something I found intersting is that Lucky was the 7th video by Britney and song number 7 on the Oops album (7 is a lucky number)! <br /> <br />OUTRAGEOUS: 5/5 - Hated it the first time, love it now. <br /> <br />I'M NOT A GIRL, NOT YET A WOMAN: 4/5 - Really good ballad, she has others that are better. <br /> <br />I'VE JUST BEGUN (HAVING MY FUN): 5/5 - I agree that it sounds like No Doubt's \\"Hella Good\\" but I love it. She wrote this song! <br /> <br />DO SOMETHIN': 6/5 - Best song on the album! This is the song that made me buy the cd. I'm not sure when she recorded this song, but I love the way she sings in it. It would mke a great single and video. <br /> <br />The bonus remix songs are really good. I really like the Megmix, Outrageous, Toxic, and Everytime. Breathe On Me was a little too long and it had too much breathing in it. <br /> <br />Overall I give it 5 stars, although I am dissapointed that they didn't include my favorite ballad with is \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know.\\" I recomend all Britney fans to buy it, especially the limited edition one.
B00005U122|5.0|\\"It's a miracle!\\" By the the time you get to that song on this DVD that's what you'll be saying! First of all it's a miracle that this DVD only cost about 12 bucks! The CD of the same concert cost more than 22 bucks! Second it's a miracle that Roger Waters is creating music that is just as good if not better than Pink Foyd! In my opinion Pink Floyd should have been called \\"The Roger Waters Band.\\" His albums \\"Amused to Death\\" / \\"Pro's and Con's of Hitchhiking\\" and \\"Radio KAOS\\" could have easily been Pink Floyd classics if they had been created back in the day! I think the group must have been holding him back and it was only his determination that produced such gems as \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" / \\"The Wall\\" and \\"Final Cut.\\" Trust me on this: this DVD is worth much more than what they are asking for it. If this DVD was not available for 12 bucks, I would buy the CD for 22 bucks and still be very happy!!!
B000005RTQ|3.0|I'll give it 3 1/2 stars. Originally released in 1984, this was Saxon's seventh lp. I remember seeing them as support act for Motley Crue on their 'Shout At The Devil' tour. Yes, this really happened. While 'Crusader' may not be the band's best album, it's still very much worth having a copy of. While I've heard other fans comment that 'Crusader' was Saxon's last 'good' lp, that simply isn't the case. In this fan's humble opinion, Saxon to THIS very day, is still able to cut a good record. Tunes I do remember them doing live (their set was nearly as long as the Crue's) was probably the better tracks off the album, which were \\"Sailing To America\\", the title cut \\"Crusader\\", \\"Just Let Me Rock\\", \\"Bad Boys (Like Rock And Roll)\\" and maybe the 'sort of' metal anthem \\"Rock City\\". Rest assure, 'Crusader' holds Biff Byford's signature vocals and the crisp guitar sound of axe-men Paul Quinn and Graham Oliver fully intact. A decent find.
B0002CU2O0|5.0|The people of RUSCICO consider all the world, instead of Criterion because they only consider the people of the USA and they ignore everybody else who doesnt speak English. I recommend you to buy this DVD if you dont speak English and You will comprehend and enjoy better this beautiful spiritual masterpiece. <br /> <br />I HATE CRITERION!!!!!!!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|its just as good as Let go only not as kiddish more in depth and mature. my favorite songs on under my skin are take me away, together, nobodys home,+ fall to pieces. Freak out and How does it feel r pretty good 2. dont tell me and my happy ending are very catchy as well. The only ones that arent good are Who Knows and Slipped Away, but besides those its a great album i def recommend it!!!!
B000062YB1|5.0|I can not stress enough on how much I love this album! Slayer has created a masterpiece with the agression and speed of reign in blood and(for the stoners) the spooky tripped out guitar melodys of south of heaven. Jeff and Kerry realy shine here! The guitar bass and drum work on here are all FLAWLESS. They provide perfect harmony and they all keep up at the same pace. Dave Lambordo is amazing and what is even more amazing is how you here kerry and Jeff's guitars competing with eachother keeping the same pace as dave's drums! F**KING AWSOME! The songs can be fast like reign in blood but unlike reign in blood each track has there own identity and does not bore the listener(with an exception of \\"born of fire\\"that song sucks). This is a prime example of the perfect metal album. Great album to just jam to or just bang your head. It also contains the Slayer epic \\"seasons in the abyss\\",the perfect slayer song. But all the songs on here shine in there own right,that one just happens to be perfect. This whole album has everything a slayer fan or metal fan could want. To some it up,if you call yourself a metal fan and you don't own this,just kill yourself.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I read alot of the reviews on this site, and a lot of them made mention about the guys Legal problems, but all that aside focus on the music, music is a wonder to hold event the blind, sick, poor, and rich can appreciate what music has to offer.  We all may listen to different types of Music.  I have been a fan of MJ since the early days.  I play his earlier music around my kids(17,12, 4)  and no matter what,they all find something in it they love. My son who is a die hard hip-hop fan loves a lot of MJ hard booty shaking music, or most notable 2000 watts off of the invincable LP. People need to stop,think and appreciate that they are not MJ.  Because how many of you could have your every move, even the most intimate details told to the world, not just The US, but the whole world.  We tell our kids if you like something or feel strong about don't be afraid o tell the world. <br />\\"I am a MJ fan\\"  I hope one day his dream of love shall help Heal The World  The CD makes a great collection for the whole family
B000089RVX|2.0|I first borrowed this cd from a friend after hearing \\"Bring me to Life\\", which I admit, was a good song. But after listening to the whole cd I quickly realized that every song on this cd sounds the same. You have your ballads and you have all the other songs that sound somewhat like \\"Bring me to life\\". Its really not worth buying, and I'm glad I didn't spend any money to listen to this cd.

0060005424|5.0|Love all of Garth Nix's book and will forever.  Lirael is by far the best book out of the trilogy.  I think Garth Nix really went all out in creativity in this book and that was what I found captivated me the most.  I love this world that he has created (though I wouldn't want to live in it), and I love how Lirael enters the story.  Garth Nix definitely succeeded in bringing in the element of mystery and apocolytic-ness into the story that makes the story seem out of this world (which it is).  By the way, to all readers, if you liked the first two books, the third book is a must and is a great reward to read.  ( the ending almost made me cry and I felt that pang in my heart)
B0002OERI0|4.0|this cd is great but it does'nt sound like the old green day i know. they have good songs on there like american idiot,boulave of broken dreams,jeaus surburb(number 2)back to realety,but i've never heard green day like this i known green day for 6 or 7 years and they don't sound alike its like they got a new singer   but still green day is good.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|I'm quite sure what to make of Napoleon... <br /> <br />Napoleon Dynamite chronicles the life of a quirky teenager as he manages a unique home life, a budding romance, and a presidential campaign at his high school.  It is not the typical movie, and this is the strongest point.  In an era where most popular movies rely on special effects or gratuitous sex to entertain, Napoleon Dynamite employs neither. <br /> <br />However, other movie standards, like a moving plotline or even a story, are not present.  Despite, or maybe because of these shifts, the random and dry humor of the movie shines through.  The characters are unbelievably unique and at the same time familiar.  The acting is convincing, making these incredibly random characters completely believable. <br /> <br />I end this review with a warning; Napoleon Dynamite is not the typical blockbuster.  If you put the DVD in your player with those expectations, you are sure to be entertained by Napoleon Dynamite.
B000089CJI|5.0|my god. this cd is one of my favorites.i think its going to win the nomany of best cd. they have a great teckno rockish beat. <br />i heard that there is only two people?! when i heard that i was like wow!  i heard that one sings and the other one makes the bet on they internet! they are way way way way way way way way way way way better then green day and finger eleven even condbed <br />i think its a great cd i mean imean a good cd!!!!!!!!
B00005JMAH|4.0|ok: this movie is magical but not without its faults: apparantly the geography of the Hogwarts grounds has changed (for the better, IMO), it strays from the book SLIGHTLY but nothing major. When it does, it makes sense. a great example is Harry's Firebolt. Once you see the film you'll understand why it was a good move. My only complaint is that they didn't dwell on the Prongs, Padfoot, Moody and Wormtail story. Bottom line: best Potter film, however, to get the full expereince read the book AS WELL. Reading the first two books wasn't neccessary to 'get' the movies. I'm anxious for &quot;HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE&quot; due Nov. 18, 2005. I just hope that #4 follows the book, as it is BIG...
1572814349|5.0|This deck is a work of Art and was executed as such. It is not a bizarre mutation or some other attempt to push someone's personal agenda but is rather an tasteful expression of the blending of Art and Arte for its own purpose. The assembly of figures and symbols from different sources for collage is careful and well thought out. The blending of these images into seamless compositions is truly a treat for the eyes as well as for the Sight.
B0002BO0AS|4.0|there are heaps of metal bands at the moment that sound like each other bigtime,Unearth,killswith Engage,Lamb of God,Shadows Fall and God forbid,although all these bands rock they are nothing truly original,although I prefer these bands than most of the nu metal movement,at least the nu metal movement had a little more variety,all these bands sound heavily influenced by Slayer's Reign In Blood,although this is a good thing,I really think Metal fans will tire of this genre quite quickly,I would highly recommend most Swedish bands,At The Gates,Haunted,Dark Tranquility,Opeth,In Flames,Soilwork etc.and Children of Bodom who are Finnish.American Metal has really lost it's originality at the moment,here's hoping the next movement is very soon
B0006284JQ|1.0|That's probably the most painful statement I can make about any female on the planet.  No problems going to war on words here, her records don't sell so she's fading faster than her clothes.  And yeah, I'm soooooo jealous.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|The true revelation of \\"Troy\\" is David Benioff, the author of a tough, demystifying screenplay, which is also able to give coherence to a scattered, contradictory  mythical tradition. Benioff eliminates the gods, lifeless ghosts of an ancestral religion, who already in Homer appeared to be only vain, even ridicolous puppets. Achilles cuts the head of Apollon off, but on the other hand Hector openly contests the useless superstitions of some grotesque Trojan priests. But the main target of Benioff's polemic script is the thirst for power of Agamemnon and Menelaus, the Homeric \\"hateful sons of Atreus\\"; the Trojan war itself is condemned as a prototype of every  ancient (or modern) imperialistic war.  <br />But if the movie blames the war, by presenting it as a dreadful myth of the past (but, unfortunately, of the present too), on the contrary it shows a deep respect towards Homer and his poetry. Entire sequences of the Iliad are carefully translated into images of flawless, suggestive spectacularity.  If one knows rhe Iliad well, it is easy for him to identify keen references to single verses of the Homeric masterpiece: the Achaean \\"phalanx\\" which tightens itself, \\"man close to man, shield close to shield\\";  Achilles who \\"puts his hands on the chest of\\" the dead Patroclus, and stays awake near his friend's pyre for a whole night; the impeccable representation of the Greek camp, of the ships and of the tents. The so often criticized 'alterations' of the Homeric text represent a discussion of the myth, not of Homer's poetry. As a matter of fact, the most significant changes do not concern Homer, but the final part of the Trojan saga, which was originally narrated by some modest rhapsodes trying to imitate the great Homer. It is worthwhile to indicate that the final of Troy, with its precocious sentimental implications, is inspired to the Medieval tradition, especially to Benoit de Sainte Maure's \\"Roman de Troie\\"(very well known also to Dante), while the movie gives lessimportance to the incoherent, disordered tales of the late Epic tradition.  <br />Some more words about the acting. Brad Pitt is incredibly able to identify himself with the melancholic (although lethal)Achilles; but also Eric Bana is convincing in his interpretation of Hector, and Orlando Bloom manages well the anti-heroic character for excellence, that is to say Paris. Only the women are a disappointment, excepting Rose Byrne/Briseis.  <br />
B00005JKGZ|5.0|When MGM's real lion Louis B. Mayer was approached with the idea of bringing Sally Benson's serialized New Yorker magazine stories of the sweet life in turn-of-the-century St. Louis, he balked: \\"Nothing happens!\\"  And he was right.  Luckily, he was convinced otherwise by his favorite studio reader.  \\"It's FAMILY,\\" she said, all that was needed to change his mind.  Purchased as a vehicle for the studio's premier musical performer Judy Garland, it also contained a plum role for uber-moppet Margaret O'Brien.  Leon Ames, June Lockhart, Mary Astor, Tom Drake and Marjorie Main round out the perfectly cast ensemble.  Lucille Bremer, a personal favorite and protegee of producer Arthur Freed, was cast as Judy's sister.  Lucille Who you ask?  It reminds us that you can have looks, talent and even connections, but only the   public can make a star.    Vincente Minnelli, arguably the greatest director of film musicals during the Golden Age, or any age, deserves 100% of the credit for turning St. Louis into a living, breathing, breathtaking postcard.  A famous contemporary review of the film called it \\"a musical even the deaf will enjoy.\\"  Minnelli painstakingly chose and matched the rich colors of the sets and costumes, designed the innovative lighting and somehow turned Garland- no raving beauty - into a raving beauty.      He gets flawless performances out of Garland and Bremer as St. Louis lovelies on the cusp of their first romances, and a delightful portrayal from little Miss O'Brien, a performer so canny that, like Shirley Temple, she was sometimes accused of secretly being an adult midget.  The DVD is worth the price of purchase if only for O'Brien's Halloween sequence, which is pure Minnelli- as visually rich as you can get without going over the top.    Garland is at her World War Two peak and at the height of her broad appeal.  As her career progressed and well-publicized problems added layers to her personality, she cast a narrower net for her audiences.  In \\"St. Louis,\\" however, we can enjoy a more innocent Judy portraying an innocent girl at a most innocent time, in the most innocent and pure of locales- the MGM soundstage.  So lushly mounted is the film that the music (after all, it is a musical) seems an afterthought.  It is a joyous collection of tunes that fit the story and move the plot along.  \\"The Boy Next Door\\" and \\"The Trolley Song\\" showcase both the bitter and the sweet sides of Garland.  \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" is a holiday delight, seldom sung anymore because after Judy sings a song, it becomes... well, a \\"Judy song.\\"  On every level, \\"Meet Me in St. Louis\\" is as perfect a film musical as one could hope to see year after year.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|Buddy has always been a little different.  As one of Santa's elves, Buddy (Will Ferrell) grew to well over six feet tall and never seemed to display the usual elfin preternatural gift for toy craftsmanship (while other elves knocked out a thousand Etch-a-Sketches per day, Buddy couldn't top one hundred).    His confusion ends one day when Buddy learns the residents of The North Pole adopted him many years ago.  With that new information, the full-grown adult with a perpetual child-like disposition sets out toward New York City in search of the father he never knew existed. <br /> <br />Buddy's \\"fish-out-of-water\\" adventures in New York and his search for love and acceptance from his father (James Caan) make up most of the action of \\"Elf\\".  In NYC, Buddy discovers gum on the street isn't free candy and signs that read \\"world's best cup of coffee\\" aren't necessarily true.   The filmmakers make a bold and wise decision by refraining from having Buddy change (to grow up and lose his nave, trusting demeanor).  He remains the sincere, wide-eyed elf throughout the entire film, never forgetting to take time to enjoy himself by consuming copious amounts of syrup and making himself sick by going round and around in revolving doors. <br /> <br />Not only does \\"Elf\\" refrain from re-cycling the same tired stories usually seen during the holiday season, it takes jabs at Christmas specials of the past.  The opening act is filled with witty, clever incidents that arise when elves raise a human and when the child grows up and returns to society.    The early comic set-ups seem to come from people who know and love the Rudolph/Frosty specials but still can't resist lampooning them a bit. <br /> <br />As with most light-hearted comedies, the first half of the film provides more entertainment than the last half.  Most of the funny incidents help establish the character of Buddy and the conflict of his life in New York.  Thus, once that is established, the film becomes more about a clichd plot where Buddy's father needs to learn about the true spirit of Christmas and blah blah blah.      <br /> <br />Even with an obvious and predictable ending, viewing \\"Elf\\" must be described as a wholly enjoyable experience.  Will Ferrell once again allows himself to play a character that audiences will want to laugh at (not with).  He is simple, ignorant, illogical...and utterly irresistible.    The film's appeal tethers itself to Ferrell's Buddy and is the result of clever, witty people (Ferrell, Director Favreu and writer Berenbaum) who have learned that \\"silly\\" and \\"smart\\" are not mutually exclusive traits. <br />
B00005N53P|4.0|Media hype follows the Strokes like a hungry dog. But with its classic punk-inspired uptown-grit rock, it's undeniable that while they aren't exactly the saviors of rock'n'roll, they are a solid and enjoyable chunk of it. \\"Is This It\\" offers the answer to its own drawled question.<br /><br />A pounding rhythm and several variations of the question \\"Is this it?\\" kick off the title track, a swaying rock melody. Following it are a catchy, gritty collection of lo-fi rockers. The uniquely-named Julian Casablancas drones in a delicious monotone through the fast-moving \\"Barely Legal,\\" the uneasy \\"Leave Me Alone,\\" the deceptively simple-sounding \\"Last Night,\\" and the skipping percussion of \\"Hard to Explain.\\"<br /><br />Due to the lavish praise heaped on the Strokes, they've become a love-'em-or-hate-'em phenomena. They're obviously influenced by the legendary Velvet Underground, Stooges and Television, but with a twenty-first century twist of New Yorker ennui and art-rock underpinnings.<br /><br />Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond's complex guitar riffs are the gems of this album -- they drone, they skip, they reverberate, and they sear. Nikolai Fraiture's bass is a good dark edge, and Fabrizo Moretti's drumming sounds like little strikes of lighting -- fast, sharp and out of the blue. They have plenty of energy and fire, never letting their instrumentation lag.<br /><br />Julian Casablancas has now become the reference point for male singers who sing in a bored monotone, as if they are too jaded to show emotion in a song. The only time he breaks out of it is in \\"Barely Legal,\\" where he almost sounds excited at times. \\"I wanna steal your innocence/To me my life it don't make sense,\\" he says, and sounds like he means it.<br /><br />This much you can see: The Strokes are far from being the saviors of rock'n'roll. But their punk-tinged New Yawker rock is still some pretty good music, and \\"Is This It\\" remains a likable if spotty debut.
0553269631|1.0|\\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\" is simply a compilation of character sketches loosely strung together.  If you are a student of literary characterization and the methods authors use to bring a character to life, you might enjoy this book. The charcters are indeed animated.  However, if you are searching for a book that combines vivid characters with any sort of plot, this book is not for you.  By the time I was half-way through the book I was seriously wondering when a coherant plot would develop.  One never materialized.  This book does not adhere to the standard beginning-middle-end, protagonist-antagonist-plot-resolution formula by which most novels abide.   <br />As I was reading this book as a book club assignment, I trudged through to its completion.  Now all I wish is that I could recapture the hours of life wasted on its pages.
B00065GX64|3.0|I currently own both DVD versions of M.  The new special edition is a victim of WAAAAAAY too much edge enhancement in the remastering process in an effort to create the illusion of a sharper picture.  Everything about the new edition exhibites jaggy lines which ends up being a real distraction.  The video transfer was supposed to be better on the new version, but the reality is that its not.  If you want to witness a proper restoration, see the restored authorized edition of \\"Metropolis\\"...also view the special feature about the \\"Metropolis\\" restoration to see how restoration is done properly.  The other problem issue is the new subtitle translation.  In some cases its more accurate, in other cases, its less.  For instance at the end during the kangaroo court proceedings, there is no reference to the 'paragraph 51' defense, which is the German equivelant (at the time)to pleeding insanity today.  Its in the earlier Criterion edition, but not the new one.  If it wasn't for the added special features, I'd score it a 1 out of 5.  This is an insulting special edition for such an important piece of cinema.
B0001VWP8I|3.0|Anastacia is the female version of Robbie Williams--huge everywhere except America.  What makes it humorous is that ... she's American.  In the past, there's been some effort here to raise her profile, most notably the 2002 VH1 \\"Divas\\" show, but she still remains far in the background behind the Britneys and Hilarys and Ashlees, which is a shame.  Her self-titled third album, while far from perfect, nonetheless spotlights her distinctive voice and makes you wonder why Epic isn't giving her more of a push in the States. <br /> <br />While her first two records are basically dance pop, \\"Anastacia\\" takes on a distinctly rock feel, helped along no doubt by Glenn Ballard, who knows his chick singers (Wilson Phillips, Alanis Morissette, et al) and wrote some of the songs on the record.  By far the standout is the terrific \\"Left Outside Alone,\\" which starts out with Anastacia channeling Kate Bush and turns into a catchier, less bombastic version of \\"You Oughta Know.\\"  Unfortunately, with the exception of the pounding \\"I Do,\\" most of the songs kind of blend together into a guitar-edged blur--however, compared to the current teeny queens it's a good-sounding mess.  Like Robbie, Anastacia seems to have given up on breaking in the States--which, again like Robbie she doesn't need to do because her records sell in the millions everywhere else--but those needing a break from the pablum fed to the masses by Clear Channel but still like good pop might want to check 'Stacia out.
055357342X|5.0|A great read. I went through the first four books so very fast. I would have paced myself better if I knew that the Storm of Swords would end at such a cliffhanger. Infact, if any, that would be my only criticism; it is so good, you want to finish it at one go. I wonder if there are many other readers out there, who like me, are waiting with bated breaths for the next installment.  <br />What do I like about this series? The scope, the tight pace and the magnificent cast of characters. There is a strange molding of characters; so bloody realistic for the fantasy genre, where you don't know if you should be rooting for the villains or the heroes. Bloody and marvellously violent, yet it remains true to its heart, and you feel quite acutely the pain felt by your 'heroes'. I love the villains and the so called heroes keep dying, so my allegiances keep changing. <br />All in all, its my favourite fantasy read this year, and I'm waiting impatiently for the Feast fo Crows to hit my shores.
B000687M48|5.0|Evanescence is one of the, if not, best bands in the mainstream right now, and this cd is a nice testament that it's well deserved.  Many come to conclude that it's too early in Evanescence's career to make a live cd, but those also don't realize that Evanescence has been out for quite some time, and Fallen is just their debut album on a major record label, so my opinion is it's about time.<br /><br />I must admit, Amy Lee does sound the same live, but that is not to suggest she doesn't sing good.  I personally feel it's the fact that people are used to hearing the board edited music instead of live music, so it throws people off and causes them to believe that she is a horrible singer.  But if you listen to previous music not released on Fallen such as \\"Breathe No More\\", you can hear her haunting yet pretty and elegant vocal style.  And also, songs like \\"My Immortal\\", \\"Bring Me To Life\\", \\"Tourniquet\\", and \\"Imaginary\\" remain really good performances.  There's only a few songs it rather lacks in such as \\"Haunted\\", \\"Going Under\\", and \\"Whisper\\".  But it really hits gold with songs like \\"Breathe No More\\", \\"Thoughtless\\", \\"Father Away\\", \\"Taking Over Me\\", and \\"Everybody's Fool\\" and the terrific studio recording of \\"Missing\\".<br /><br />But the album does not end, it also is packed with a bonus DVD that includes their entire concert as well as all 4 of their music videos (Bring Me To Life, Going Under, My Immortal, and Everybody's Fool) and hilarious behind the scenes footage.<br /><br />This is definitely a gift for anyone who is a fan of Evanescence.  It's nearly flawless, and any flaws it does have, it's quickly masked by all it's extra features.  This is just proof that Evanescence has the power to stay around.
1401200605|2.0|No change or progress in Lee's art style.  Unfortunately a lot of fanboys/girls as well as editors feel this is the style that should be used for superhero comics.  Save your money and instead purchase Batman interpretations by Frank Miller, David Mazzuchelli, and Matt Wagner.  Storywise, it was alright.
B0000C6K09|5.0|A stunning compelation of the best and most popular work of John Williams. From the epics of his music for George Lucas's Star Wars films ('The Imperial March' and 'Anikin's Theme'stand out). As well as the heart-breaking 'Schindler's List' main theme. It's all here. If you like great music then buy this NOW!
B0002OERI0|5.0|Yes you read correct. This is my favorite album of the year and I feel that this CD is the best of this year. This is one of the only CD's that I can say I can listien to any time of the year and go through every single track without skipping any song. I don't know what song is the best. They are all amazing. Green Day just proves why they are one of the best punks bands of all time and one of the best bands around today. People will say what they want about them but they are music gods. This CD is political if you couldn't tell by the title \\"American Idiot\\". Don't let that push you away from this album. You will regret it if you don't get this album because of that. <br /> <br />American Idiot is the worst song on this album. That is saying a lot since American Idiot is a good song. Right now they have 4 songs that are being played by radio stations all at once. This album has been on the Top 10 of the charts since its release date of September 21. That is about 3 months. That is pretty solid. <br /> <br />Most Green Day fans know that this CD is a maturing growth. No way does this sound identical to Dookie. Not at all. This would be bad if the sound was for the worst. This change was great. They gained so many fans because of this. People tend to stay away from \\"punk\\" music because they think that means that you have a low level of maturity. Well now people have no excuse to lisiten to Green Day. They took a major step forward here. This is easily the best CD of the year. 7 Grammy Nominations prove that.  <br />
B0002MB7QW|4.0|Sure it's unbelievable, sure the characters are cardboard stock and the dialog trite and comical ('I'm warming you with my body heat,' says cute geek chick to cute geek guy who is Dennis Quaid's son.)  Nobody seems to get what's going on BIG time in this movie (especially the bureaucrats and politicians whose fault this all appears to be) until the last second, which is why so many people get drowned and swept into tornadoes and frozen to death.  Folks just stare like they can't figure out everything's gone crazy, and then run away screaming from spectacular awesome special effects ~ okay the effects ARE the film.  It's great fun all around, loads of entertainment.  And it's so cute how Dennis Quaid rescues his son holed up in the public library burning all the great literary volumes of the world.  Neither snow nor sleet nor hail nor ....
B0001UL7RY|5.0|1. Take Me Away -As the title says, a song about feeling scared and alone, wanting to be taken away. I thought it was pretty good.     2. Together -Prolly my favorite song on here. The beat is  just gorgeous, the lyrics are great, and her voice is filled with emotion.     3. Don't Tell Me -A song about not letting guys control you. Thats something you gotta appreciate. Terrific song, I liked it right away.     4. He Wasn't -A song with simple lyrics, but i think that might have been the point. The beat is spunky and energetic, and its a good song to jump around to.    5. How Does It Feel -Not bad at all. Its a dreamy, mellow  sort of song with thought provoking lyrics.     6. My Happy Ending -Overplayed on the radio, but overall the song is good. A sarcastic, angry letdown of a relationship gone wrong.     7. Nobody's Home -One of my favorites on here. Good beat, lyrics, and vocals. Something i can totally relate to.          8. Forgotten -Another good song, about feeling forgotten about your needs not being met, and the music has an angry beat to it.      9. Who Knows -This is a happy song with a good message and optimisitc lyrics. I like this song, but its not one for my bad days.     10. Fall to Pieces -Softer guitar on this track. Although the lyrics are done beautifully, and the beat grows on you.  It expresses the feel of the song quite well.      11. Freak Out -Really good song, filled with energy and confidence. The ability to live your life and not care what other people think of you.      12. Slipped Away -A song about her grandpa. A sad song, but a beautiful emotional ballad where she sings her heart out.    Overall, i gave it 5 stars because i like all of the songs. I do like her first album better, but i just seem to like this one in a different way. It just seems to show a different side of her on here, revealing her true colors.
B000002KOQ|5.0|The first time I heard this record was during winter vacation of my junior year at Vassar, in 1967.  When it was recorded a few years later, I retired my worn-out non-existent copy for a tangible, vinyl release.  What's so special about this album is that it serves as an excellent documentation of the idealistic young woman's transition from an idealistic young woman into a less idealistic woman who is not as young.  She's still young and idealistic here, but not as much as on her two previous releases, and moreso than on the releases to follow.  I think it's interesting to note, when looking at her discography, that the OLDER the album (her oldest being released in 1968 I believe), the YOUNGER and MORE IDEALISTIC we find our Joni.  Maybe we can all learn from Joni to become a little more idealistic as we grow older, or to grow younger especially in times such as these.
B0006399FS|5.0|I can't believe some people have turned down this album so easily...  folks, DO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO THOSE EMPTY CRITICISMS... this album is like any other music album; its music will grow on you every time you listen to it.  Tracks such as \\"Sometimes you can't make it on your own\\", \\"Miracle Drug\\" and \\"Crumbs from your Table\\" will be remembered among the best acts from these guys since their earlier times of glory.   <br /> <br />I remember that some 13 years ago, I paid attention to what some dude said in the radio about Achtung Baby:  It called the album a \\"ridiculous attempt\\" gave it three stars and, instead, praised Genesis' last coherent effort, \\"We Can't Dance\\".  I was goofy enough to prefer the latter and spend 13 $ on it.  Today, I think my dog is playing frisbee with the Genesis' album and, guess what?, my wonderful Achtung Baby gets played at least every week! <br /> <br />So give the \\"Bomb\\" a try for a while... it will capture your heart and soul.  Trust us.
0345363132|3.0|I know a lot of people are going to be mad at me. Perhaps this book just isn't for me. Other reviewers commented on the storyline, so I'll just add the things that struck me while I was reading it.    Not only is the subject matter complex, but history requires that the story contain an excessive number of characters. Furthermore, they're referred to not only by their given names, but by their titles or the geographic locations they're \\"Earl of\\", or \\"Duke of\\". So \\"Edmond\\" is also \\"Rutland\\", and \\"Richard Neville\\" is also \\"Warwick\\" and so forth. Too many people have two or more names, including nicknames, or names that are very similar. This may be historically accurate, but it makes for confusion anyway. If you can't sit down and focus for extended periods of time, you're going to get lost each time you're interrupted. Perhaps it was the fact that my life is busy that made this a difficult book to get into. This is not to say that I prefer a beach read or a shorter book. I just think complex subject matter and a large number of characters can sometimes be managed to make the reading flow more easily, and to make picking up where you left off less of a chore. I would have begun by taking literary license and referring to characters consistently, and by their given names only. I might also have elimimated some of the minor characters to simplify the structure.    So this is merely a warning to someone who doesn't have hours at a stretch to sit down with this book. It's a lot of work, if your attention is frequently pulled elsewhere.    The author makes repeated grammatical errors as well; incomplete sentences and comma splices are everywhere. These can be used VERY sparingly to set the tone. However, in this book I found myself not only trying to settle back in after an interruption and gather up all my thoughts, but getting stopped short by incorrect sentence structure in nearly every paragraph. As a result, I kept rereading sentences because I thought that surely I must have misread them the first time. It bogged me down and distracted me from the story. An editor should have addressed that, in my opinion.     Though admittedly most of the reviewers neither recognized or noticed the writing technicalities, nor did they care, so for most people this shouldn't a problem. Ignore this observation if you know you're one of those and focus on the story, which is great!     The author is a fantastic storyteller - and it's certainly a fascinating story - but the technical issues were distracting to me. I feel that, out of a five-star rating, writing technicalities comprise two of the stars. That is why I opted for a three-star rating. I give her full credit for storytelling!
B00062J00S|5.0|Readers, you most likely do not know me personally at all, but if you're doubting that this movie is one of the most magical movies Hollywood ever made, there's only one thing you need to know: That I was actually smiling by the end of this movie. My normally cynical heart usually balks at these kinds of uplifting movies with its feel-good endings that either seem tacked on or just plain false (heck, I'm one of the few that disliked the recent FINDING NEVERLAND, with its cheesy \\"just believe\\" philosophy; oh, and I'm not too keen on the engineered \\"Christmas spirit\\" either). But maybe I'm just a sucker for movies in which ordinary men like George Bailey find themselves so disappointed in their lives that they must be reminded---as indeed he is, in genuinely heartwarming fashion---how much of a difference they truly made in the ordinary world. Akira Kurosawa's IKIRU had a similar theme, and I was moved to tears by parts of that movie too (although some of it was admittedly sentimental and slick). And remember the ending of Alexander Payne's ABOUT SCHMIDT, with Jack Nicholson's character feeling worthless until he picks up a letter from a little kid in another part of the world? That final shot of Nicholson welling up with tears is comparable to the final scene of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, in which nearly an entire town congregates in George Bailey's house to remind him of what  an important man he truly is in the small town of Bedford Falls. Who doesn't want to feel important in some way? And that final quote from Clarence: \\"no man is a failure who has friends.\\" Truly a maxim to live by, if you ever feel down about yourself and your place in the world!    As you can probably tell, then, I love this movie. Director Frank Capra never seems to be pushing for audience goodwill the way he did towards the end of his 1938 Oscar-winning YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU; this is probably Capra's masterpiece. And James Stewart, as the American Everyman George Bailey, gives a performancethat is stunning in its wide emotional range. You can see why people would like him, and yet you can feel the disappointment he feels in himself. Okay, so the movie is a little long, and the opening shot of the stars talking to each other is laughably cheesy. In the face of the sheer magic this movie conjures forth, those are mere nits. IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is a wonderful movie. Highly recommended.
B000005GYI|5.0|What motivated me to purchase this album was Milton Nascimento's magnificent voice and his soulful and expressive style.  Nascimento is one of the forerunners in the movement of Brazilian Popular Music.  (Musica Popular do Brasil)  This is best described as a fusion of sounds (Brazilian combined with jazz and pop, as an example).  Also, the lyrics are quite take on the tone of social consciousness and go beyond the typical subject matter of popular music (i.e: love and heartbreak).<br /><br />Some of the strongest pieces on this album are \\"Saidas E Bandeiras No 1\\" (a great piece that features raw acoustic instruments like the guitar and the drum),  \\"San Vicente\\" (a song with a beautiful sound that I would best describe as The Beatles in Portuguese--both thoughtful, introspective and full of poignance), and \\"Lilia\\" (Milton's falsetto is greatly showcased at its best on this cut).<br /><br />This CD also features the songs of another famous Brazilian singer, Lo Borges.  Both men add their strengths as vocalists and songwriters on this album.  Though, I don't speak Portuguese, it didn't really matter because the universal language of music really comes through in, both, the more upbeat pieces and the quieter, more low key songs.
B00005JN0T|5.0|Rip roaring fun and an interesting premise.<br /><br />Will Smith plays LA detective Del Spooner in 2035 faced with a what appears to be at first a suicide at USR - the main robotics manufacturer on the eve of the introduction of a new revolutionary robot model the NS-5. During the investigation Smith starts to believe the a robot, one of the new ones murdered the dead scientist and mad eit only appear to be a suicide.  Spooner has \\"issues\\" with robots in general, and wants to charge the robot with murder.<br /><br />I'll leave the rest of the plot for those of you who have not seen the movie yet, but I have to say that this film doesn't let up for a minute. Will Smith solidifies his bone-fides as a credible action star (and has been obviously spending a lot of time in the gym lately) and really makes the movie.<br /><br />Smith was an excellent casting choice as was Bruce Greenwood - always one of my favorite bad-guys when he does bad guys, few do it better. I won't elaborate for this movie whether or not he was bad guy - they'll be no spoilers in this review.<br /><br />I really liked the way they gave the robot intelligence and emotions. I haven't watched the bonus tracks yet to see exactly how it was done but they somehow merged the CGI with the acting of Alan Tudyk ( Firefly ) for great blend of HAL seriousnes and Mr Data's (STNG) quest to understand himself. (<br /><br /> for ther record  I am not a STNG fan, but I recognize that it was good in certain areas, nonsense in others. Mr Data was one of the better points of the series)<br /><br />I wish there had been more of this exploration of philosphy. For example my favorite lines from the filme were during a conversation between Spooner and Sonny:<br /><br />Spooner: You are a clever imitation of life... Can a robot write a symphony? Can a robot take a blank canvas and turn it into a masterpiece?<br /><br />Sonny: Can you?<br /><br />This line summed up the conflict between Spooners idea of what a robot should be ( a toaster , It's just lights and clockwork.\\") against his inner conflicts and prejudices. How do you charge a microwave oven with murder?<br /><br />Direction was tight and focused on the story and the characters. I was pleased to see Bridget Moynahan although the part underutilized her talents. Special effects were as expected, and I guess that says a lot about the state of visual effects today. They were as real as real gets and I guess thats we expect these days. Imagine though this movie being shown even 10 years ago, but say in 1975. What would the movie-goer think? I submit that the movie goer would believe that we will have intelligent robots acting in movies in 2004.<br /><br />I loved the cars too. Audi did an excellent job of conceptualizing cars 30 years from now. Not that I expect they will actually look like that in 2035 but I believe they could look like that - which is what a movie requires.<br /><br />Overall I highly recommend this movie. It's science fiction no denyng that, but what real sci-fi should be. Thoughtful, believable stories about characters you can care about set in a futuristic backdrop with amazing gadgets yet still playing mainly on the human element - even the robot's human element.<br /><br />These are the sci-fi concepts invented by Jules Verne and perfected by geniuses like Isaac Asimov and A.C. Clarke. I am sure Asimov would have been proud at what they did with his concept and story. I've been reading Asimov for 40 years and felt right at home with this story. Too bad he is not alove to enjoy this wonderful variation of his original story.<br /><br />This is a not miss. I bought this one an expect to enjoy it many more times.what a robot should be ( a toaster , It's just lights and clockwork.\\") against his inner conflicts and prejudices.

B00005JN2Z|5.0|Director Michael Mann does what he does best with \\"Collateral\\", a well-written (by Stuart Beattie), entertaining thriller that knows just when to be intense and when to be mellow. \\"Collateral\\" takes place overnight in Los Angeles. Max (Jamie Foxx), a veteran cab driver who dreams of owning a limousine service, picks up Vincent (Tom Cruise), a slick, talkative fare who offers him $600 for a night's work: 5 stops and get him to the airport by 6 a.m. Sounds good, but when a bloody corpse lands on his windshield, Max comes to the abrupt realization that Vincent is an assassin. He becomes an unwilling accomplice in a murder spree, as Vincent attempts to fulfill his professional obligations and Max tries to walk the line between thwarting a killer and saving himself.<br /><br />Much of \\"Collateral\\" is distinctly mellow in tone. Low-key conversations play out over the classical music in Max's cab. This makes the bursts of action more intense and surprising. No one could call \\"Collateral\\" realistic, but the attention to detail in the characters' speech makes it seem so. I have to admire Tom Cruise for embracing villain roles at this point in his career, where other stars have shunned them or insisted on watered-down scripts. Cruise has nothing to lose by playing unlikable characters, and they will among his most memorable work. Vincent's self-possession lends him great presence and charm, while his moral bankruptcy makes him revolting. Cruise is perfect for the role. Jamie Foxx plays the film's \\"everyman\\" who rises to the occasion when circumstances demand it. He's stressed, put-upon, and trapped, and he acts it. Jada Pinkett Smith does a nice job in a supporting role as a prosecutor, Annie, who takes a ride in Max's cab, as does Mark Ruffalo as Police Detective Fanning, who suspects trouble in Max's cab after one of his informants is murdered. Great cast, great dialogue, and perfect pacing make \\"Collateral\\" an engaging, character-driven thriller that almost everyone will enjoy.l enjoy.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|Tom Cruise never ceases to amaze. Just when you thought he found his niche he breaks away from it to do something really different.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx was the real treat in this movie however. His portrayal of the taxi driver Max, dreamer and frustrated limo service operator in my opinion rockets him to the big time in character acting.<br /><br />I actually have always enjoyed Micheal Mann's movies. Part music video and part intense action drama noone blends the two concepts together like Mann does. It's not necessary to like the blend but you have to admit that he does it well.<br /><br />No sense rehashing the premise here but briefly Foxx is a taxi driver who picks up a fare ( Cruise ) and gets hired for the whole night to bring \\"Vincent\\" to visit a host of \\"friends\\" (well they're somebody's friends) throught the night and deliver him to the airport in the morning.<br /><br />The first \\"visit\\" results in a little unexpected turn and Foxx is now in for the game whether he likes it or not.<br /><br />There are parts that are intense and some things that are comic along with quite a few memorable lines like my favorite:<br /><br />  Max: Hey! Hey, he fell on the cab! I think he's dead.<br />  Vincent: Good guess.<br />  Max: You... you killed him?<br />  Vincent: No, I shot him. The bullets and the fall killed him.<br /><br />Anyway - I didn't buy this DVD. I don't see myself watching it over and over again but for a one time view I recommend this as a \\"don't miss\\".<br /><br />Casting was terrific, Cruise was great but Foxx was better.<br />I was thrilled to see Irma Hall again (LadyKillers) and Jada Pinkett Smith was as always a welcome addition to the cast of any movie I am watching.<br /><br />Good watch for a Saturday night. Well worth the 2 hours invested.<br /><br />I guess this movie isn't for everyone, but if you liked Phone Booth you should like this. I didn't like Phone Booth but liked this.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|Seing as two of my great loves are Seth Green and Mini Coopers, this movie was perfect! Seth has a hilarious role of the computer genius (the Napster) and my only dissapointment was that he didn't get to be in a Mini Cooper. &#60;br /&#62; Other than that, It was just a wonderful movie.
B00004WLXZ|5.0|One nice feature about this DVD is that the optional English subtitles are in yellow text.  Earlier editions had them in white, which made them hard to read in a classroom situation.  These are very easy to follow for students who don't understand German.
0399110925|5.0|Like a couple of other readers here I have to say that appreciating this particular Heyer is best done after you have had a taste of the other books..but it is well worth it.  <br /> <br />If you started reading Georgette Heyer at 13 or 14 like I did, your early favourites might be the more swashbucking tales like These Old Shades (which still remains in my top 10 favourite Heyers).  <br /> <br />I picked up Cotillion first from a second hand pile of books while on holiday in Bath, and it has never left my book shelf ever since. The subtlety of the telling, the comedy and the characterisations let you know that you are in in the realms of art. <br /> <br />Anyway, will some publisher please get a reprint out very very soon, and this well-loved copy of mine is threatening to fall into a fine powder from my periodic re-readings over the years. For some reason, Cotillion seems to be a neglected masterpiece, but honestly, any fan must get a copy of this one and see for yourself.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Love this movie! Its very original, very funny.  At first you are kind of laughing at Napolean and his pals, but by the end of the movie you laugh not at him so much as with him.  You realize that yes, he's a really big dork but thats ok.  Its just so funny!
0064407667|5.0|I wanted to read it before the movie because usually the book is better than the movie if you have read the book. I found it to be excellent.It is so unique and different.I highly recommend it.  <br />

B000059Z8M|5.0|My 4 year old son loves Toy Story 2 and rented it every opportunity we had, however that was getting expensive so my search began to find it on DVD.  For months I was unable to locate this movie on DVD or VHS and gave up until prior to Christmas.  I finally found it on the Amazon.com website as used and purchased it right away. My son loves this movie and will watch every chance he gets.  The family also enjoyed the movie and will most likely purchase this movie for their own kids and enjoyment.
6305949980|5.0|I love this film.  Great animation, great story and great music as well.  We have to bear in mind that this masterwork of animation is previous to Pixar's computer animation films.  I think is important to watch also the making of this movie that the same DVD brings in this special edition.  By watching the behind scenes of this film you appreciate it much better. By the way my little 5-years old nephew loves this film too so it fits to any age.
B0006399FS|1.0|This cd release sounds way to rushed and to me sounds like a rushed release to cash in on the holidays, after two listens gave it to my niece, go out and pick up Green Day American Idiot or Velvet Revolver Contraband if you want some decent rock music for the holidays.
B00004WG2F|3.0|Legends of the Fall can be summed up in four words: Brad Pitt's flowing hair. Every time the violins play and the camera goes hazy we see Brads hair and you know that there will either be a love scene or a killing.     The story is melodramatic and so many ridiculous things  happen that it's hard not to laugh. When young Samuel brings his fiancee home from the East it starts a chain of trouble that goes on for the rest of the movie.     Susanah, played by the always dreary Julia Ormond,  takes one look at Brad's hair and is smitten. He also falls for her and so does Alfred, the oldest brother. Why these men all fall in love with a character who is  weepy and doesn't seem to do much but be decorative isn't explained but there it is. Susanah marries Samuel who promptly gets himself killed in WWI in a scene that is so predictable that it's almost funny. Brad's character unties his hair, paints his face and flips out killing a passel of Germans in the process.    Time passes. We hear the lush soundtrack, watch the pretty scenery and Brad comes home to his dad, his land and his brother's widow. This time both Brad and Julia's hair blows in the wind and they jump into bed. Alfred, the sensible brother takes the hint and goes to town to get rich on his own.     So, we're about to get the happy ending right? Nope. Brad stares into space a lot and mourns his brother and has to GO FIND HIMSELF. He takes several years (but doesn't age a bit)to do it and while he's gone Susanah who apparently wants to be a part of this family no matter what, marries poor Alfred even though she doesn't love him.      We see scenery, hear the pretty music and jumping jiminy there's ole Brad again. His hair flows in the wind and now he looks happy. He's home to stay and will take care of his old dad, his land, his friends, and discovers that the cute little daughter of the housekeeper, Isabelle has grown up. He marries and gets himself a family. Happy ending now? Nope. Take a deep breath because we still have what feels like hours to go.      His good, uncomplicated wife is killed by crooked cops (I'm not even going to get into that part of the plot) and Brad does the same thing he did when Samuel snuffed it. He paints the face, lets the hair go wild, gets a thousand yard stare and starts killing everyone who was involved.     Susanah realizes that she's never going to have Brad all to herself and blows her head off, probably becuase there are no more brothers to marry. Alfred makes up with his brother and his father, played by the always great Anthony Hopkins.  Life goes on. Brad outlives the whole family excpet for the narrator who must be about 100 himself and gets eaten by a bear. The end. I'm exhausted.
0783225857|5.0|\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is, in my opinion, absolutely the finest film ever made.  Filmed in timeless black and white and perfectly cast, this motion picture is a work of art.  As for the \\"politically correct\\" reviewer who panned the film because of perceived \\"black stereotyping\\", and suggested it not be shown to anyone under 21 years of age, all I can say is sad.....very sad.  \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" should be required viewing for every child in public school in America, it might actually help to counter the influences of Darwinism and Secular Humanism that are destroying American culture and civility. <br /> <br />The performance of Robert Duvall as \\"Boo\\" Radley is, alone, worth the price of admission, but John Megna, as young \\"Dill\\" Harris, steals the film as far as I'm concerned.  Megna, the brother of actress Connie Stevens, passed away in 1995 but will always be remembered for his role as \\"Dill\\". <br /> <br />Everyone should, in my opinion, own a copy of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\".  And if you watch it.....and aren't moved by it.....well, maybe you should have a close family member call the undertaker.
0451191153|1.0|One of the most famous scenes in this \\"novel\\" glorifies rape. The villainess-cum-heroine, Dominique Francon, has been taunting handsome super-hero Howard Roark. But the beast gets tamed. One night, Roark shows up at her Connecticut mansion and silently violates her. <br />   And, dear readers, she loves it! Next morning she walks around town, chirping merrily to herself, \\"I've been raped. I've been raped.\\" <br />   I wonder how it is that so many strong-minded women can claim to like this book and all the other balderdash that goes with it. <br />   For a thorough unmasking of La Rand and her religious acolytes, I highly recommend Jeff Walker's \\"The Ayn Rand Cult.\\" <br />   For a satire of Rand, see my own \\"The Pianist Who Liked AyndRand: A Novella & 13 Stories.\\" In preparation for the title piece, I read through all of awful Ayn's oeuvre, raided it for qotes, and then proceeded to place them on the lips of my characters. It was my way of depicting and dramatizing the seductive lure of Randism on susceptible American youths. <br />    See also my essay, \\"Who Was Ayn Rand?\\" in SALMAGUNDI, Fall-Winter 2004.
B0001GL3K4|4.0|A prologue: I am not into romantic comedies...at all. Having said that, let me say this: I really enjoyed this movie. A sort of three ring circus, it follows a number of relationships from unrequited love ( a man who loves a friend's wife), puppy love (an absolutely charming depiction of a schoolboy crush), lost love ( a woman who can't follow through on her attraction to the office hunk), found love ( a housekeeper who doesn't speak his language), and the love of a true friend ( A burned out rock star who discovers his real love). There's more, and done really surprisingly well given all that's going on. Hugh Grant does what is perhaps his best smaller part as the Prime Minister who realizes his love for an unlikely staffer.  <br /> <br />I realize that this is a cliche, but this is a movie destined to become a Christmas standard. Every year you'll see it, and enjoy it.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Muse. A truly awe inspiring 3 piece band. They are absolutely HUGE over in Europe, and are catchin on fast in the US there second time around. I knew people in America, would misunderstand Muse's music. And all of a sudden I heard more Radiohead comparisons. They are british yes. They are both HIGHLY influenced by Jeff Buckley. Matt has been quoted as saying Jeff is his main influence vocally, as well as Thom. Saying Matt sounds like the singer of the darkness is utterly ridiculous. Muse came before the darkness, so its hard to copy the sound of something that hasnt come yet. The darkness sound like every crappy 70's rock band. Plus, Matt has said he freaking hates the darkness, and so do i, they are terrible. Saying Matt sounds like Thom, isint too off the mark since they both draw inspiration from the same person, Buckley. So if you think Matt's copying Thom's falsetto, search a little deeper and you'll find Thom's copying Jeff's falsetto, and so is Matt. Radiohead didnt invent everything in music, which may offend some American Radiohead fans. Muse's main inspiration includes full classical music such as Sergey Rachmaninov. As well as San Diego rockers Rage Against The Machine. If people would do a little research about there topic before writing a review before saying well
B000002AT6|4.0|Legends of the Fall is a sclocky movie but it had one saving grace: the music. This is a gorgeous soundtrack and the Ludlow, Wedding, and Samuel's death tracks are particularly moving.
B00007AJF9|2.0|When I bought this DVD I knew that it would be somewhat historically inaccurate. I was prepared for that because most historical movies are off in some aspects. I popped it into my computer and at first felt okay with everything that was going on. That was until about fifteen or twenty minutes into the movie after Elizabeth was crowned queen. Everything went straight down hill from there.     The first thing that bothered me a bit was when they showed a sex scene between Elizabeth and Robert Dudley. It could have very well happened but there was never any proof that it did. It would have been more interesting if they let it happen the way it really did, where nobody knew exactly if they were having sex or not. For example, showing Elizabeth and Robert spending a lot of time together and maybe have a seen where one of Elizabeth's ladies stumbles in on them together when Elizabeth is only in her nightgown early in the morning. It leaves you thinking in the end because you never actually saw them getting intimate. Still, I didn't let that scene ruin the movie for me.    After that scene the movie just heads down confusion lane. I tried forgetting everything I knew about Elizabeth's life in hopes that I would understand the plot but I just couldn't. Then I tried using the knowledge I obtained from reading several books about Elizabeth and I still didn't comprehend what was happing. Not only was the plot jumping about at a hyperactive pace but some scenes were just so absurd I couldn't help but laugh even though the moment was supposed to be serious. Such as one scene where this cloaked assassin is walking down the hallway towards Elizabeth. All she does is stand there and watch him approach with this confused look on her face. Since when is she left totally alone in a hallway with some masked stranger coming towards her and she doesn't even do anything? There was also another scene where one of Elizabeth's suitors comes to woe her into marriage. He stays for a bit and is hanging out in a room with scantly clad men and women when Elizabeth bursts in to find him dressed as a girl and wearing make-up. How hilarious is that? It's true that Elizabeth was offered a husband who did cross-dress but it was his brother that visited her. Besides, you think he would have enough sense not to cross-dress in a foreign ruler's palace, right? Seesh. What an embarrassment on the director's part.    I'm being completely honest when I say that I'm not being an overly harsh critic of this movie. I love reading about history and watching historical movies and television shows but this movie was a huge disappointment. I'm okay with getting some facts wrong but getting practically every single thing wrong and turning it into a huge jumbled up mess? No, I don't think so. This movie doesn't even show how great of a ruler Elizabeth was at all. Anything political that was attempted was always deluded with some silly scene that blew the whole mood into something strange -probably some sexual matter. To me this movie is nothing but a confusing lie.     The only good things about this movie was that it was somewhat beautiful with its nice costumes and the acting was well done. Those are the only reasons why I give 'Elizabeth' an extra star.
068987474X|1.0|This book did have some humorous veins, but I did not find it to be the insightful, eye-opening revalation that some claim.  Little of the information in this book was new to me.  And I am no relationship expert.  It seems quite obvious to me that if a man stands me up, beats me, or doesn't call, he is not interested. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a quick read, this is a good choice.  The large print and varying fonts make it easy to breeze through.  I read through the book in about 2 hours. <br /> <br />I would NOT recommend this book for someone who has common sense or standards for how she would like to be treated.
1400032717|5.0|This is a sort of blurb for The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time.  A blurb is a short evaluation of a book and it often is printed right on the cover of the book or on the first inside pages of the book.  There are twenty-nine blurbs for this book.  Twenty-five are on the inside and four are on the outside on the red paperback cover, which has a cut-out of an upside-down dog on the front and a small black-and-white picture of a young man in a tee-shirt with short hair and an ear-ring on the back.  The longest blurb is twenty-four words.  The shortest is four words long.  I don't have to fit my blurb on a small book with other blurbs and my blurb is already 123 words long, counting up to and including \\"already.\\" <br /> <br />The blurb near the man's picture is from Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times.  It compares this book to The Sound and the Fury and The Catcher in the Rye. <br /> <br />I once started reading The Sound and the Fury and stopped after three pages.  This was in 1970, when I was twenty-one years, two months and twelve days old.  I was less patient then than I am now, but I was also more tolerant of intellectualism.  Intellectuals love William Faulkner, who is the author of The Sound and the Fury.  Shortly after this time I read an essay by Clifton Fadiman (an essay is like a very long blurb), in which he said that he found Mr. Faulkner to be more difficult to read than he needed to be.  I find this to be a very clever comment.  Mr. Fadiman said that Immanuel Kant was difficult, but the philosophy he was writing about NEEDED to be difficult.  Mr. Faulkner did not need to be so difficult!  This made me smile.  I was reading quite a lot of Kant at this time.   Four days after I tried Mr. Faulkner I started Ulysses by James Joyce, and I also found that this needed to be difficult, which it was, and I enjoyed it very very much.  So it isn't that a novel can never be difficult. <br /> <br />The novel The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time is not difficult. <br /> <br />The Sound and the Fury is told in five parts and the first part is told by Benjy, who is very unintelligent.  Christopher Boone in The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time is VERY intelligent, although he is unusual in many ways.  This is the end of my comparison with The Sound and the Fury. <br /> <br />I am far more knowledgeable about The Catcher in the Rye.  I have read it seven times, beginning in August of 1963 when I was fourteen years and three months old.  I love this book.  I have taught it to tenth grade boys in British Columbia (twice, in 1973 and 1977) and to college students in Iowa (once, in 1979).  This comparison is better.  Both books are completely told by a fifteen year-old boy who has some difficulties in one location that is in the countryside, and decides to take a train trip to a very big city (New York for Holden Caulfield, London for Christopher).  He looks forward to seeing a female relation.  (Holden's sister, Phoebe; Christopher's mother.)  He doesn't go directly there but various things happen on the way.  Each boy likes to say exactly what he is thinking.  Nothing filters the words, and grown-ups sometimes have trouble with each boy.  Christopher doesn't like to be touched, and Holden has an upsetting incident when a former teacher named Mr. Antolini strokes his hair.  Both books are not difficult to read. <br /> <br />I disagree with many of the blurbs about The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time.  You may read reviews which say that Christopher is very literal-minded.  He says this himself, but where have you ever read something so creative as \\"then there was a sound like people fighting with swords\\" to describe an underground train approaching (p. 176)?  You may read reviews that say this is a mystery story about the murder of a dog.  There is not too much about the dog here.  That mystery is solved on page 120.  It just gets Christopher going.  Other blurbs compare Christopher to David Copperfield and Huck Finn.  The best comparison is to Paul Erdos, the Hungarian mathematician and subject of The Man Who Loved Only Numbers.  He and Christopher both love numbers and they have great difficulties with other parts of life, such as trains.  The comparison with Holden Caulfield is okay, but neither Mr. Erdos's story nor Mr. Caulfield's made me cry tears of joy all of a sudden with the last fifteen words.  I do agree with the blurbs when they report that this is an excellent book. <br /> <br />If you think you would like to read 221 pages that are written in approximately the style I have been writing in, and with some mathematical and logical puzzles as part of the story, you should read this book.
B000002INJ|1.0|Manowar its whitout doubt, the worst \\"metal\\" band in the world, Yeah, just take a look at the postings of their fans, retarded guys just like them that gave 5 stars to this garbage, man, those guys seriously need a psichotherapy or to have more sexual life, theyve got everything so tiny, yeah including \\"that\\", that they see BIG, EPIC and MONUMENTAL all around them (just a little bigger), including little pieces of s**t like this 1, i am sure they still believe that Quiet Riot is metal; REAL METAL FANS listen to JUDAS PRIEST, not this s**t, and if they listen manowar too its just to realize (and laugh about it) how pretty and ridicously bad a pretentious band like manowar can be; i usually dont write reviews, i used to read only, but this guy down here (a music (haha!) fan TN) really made me angry, how u dare to call a REAL MONUMENTAL BIG AND EPIC LEGEND like The Beatles a garbage u piece of [...]? i pass U2, Bob Dylan and Nirvana, ok, theyre nothing and i dont care if somebody talks about them, !!but The Beatles!!?? theyre infinitely BIGGER than your pathetic little band and of course... YOU!!! you [...] call manowar even bigger than God??!!!!, how could someone found helpful this?, is manowar your god u [...]? youre insane without doubt, you went sooo far; next time watch you write \\"little man\\" cause you are the only one here, just do something youve never done before... THINK!
0451526384|5.0|You know it's very difficult to choose which of Jane Austen's books it the greatest but I can say that this is one I re-read every couple of years.  This, the last of Miss Austen's fabulous set of novels, is of the woman who was forced to give up her love and then never loved another.  The heroine is more mature than those of her others books, not quite so insentive to others, nor as judgemental.  Maybe the most exasperating aspect of this book is that you can see that once reunited, the two still love each other, but obey those deeply instilled lessons in behavior to the point that I find myself almost saying 'for goodness sake, just tell him you love him still'!  But that wouldn't be a Jane Austen novel, for you'ld miss the ongoing narrative of families who behave even as families do today, and all of the love knots would not be tied only as neatly as this queen of the early novel could do.  Oh, if only she had lived longer, but at least we still, almost 200 years later still have her masterpieces to read over and over!
B00004T8RK|5.0|the other reviewers are right about the headphones/ its a better listen that way for sure/ i listen to this album on a long drive with my son who loves pearl jam last summer/ and safe to say it blew me away/ later i listened to it with headphones/ it was even better/ great job pearl jam you're awesome!
B0002858YS|5.0|All of the British bands that American Anglophiles worship (New Order, the Smiths, Happy Mondays) hailed from Manchester, the dreariest, working-classiest major city in England. Accordingly, the Killers--the U.S.'s best stab yet at slickly alluring Anglo electropop--are a bunch of white-bread boys from Las Vegas, who, on sure-shot party starters \\"Mr Brightside\\" and \\"Somebody Told Me,\\" make hedonism sound almost holy. Full of sweaty, ambisexual snogs and sweeping John Hughes-worthy ballads, Hot Fuss is like doing a semester abroad without ever having to leave your suburb.
0156027321|4.0|Life of Pi -- the book by Yann Martel is the story of a boy, Pi Patel who is stranded on a lifeboat along with a Royal Bengal tiger, a hyena, a zebra and an orangutan. He was travelling to Canada with his family, when their illfated ship goes down leaving him in this predicament. How he survives from being eaten by the tiger and survives death on his fascinating voyage across the Pacific Ocean is the story. However, there is another thread under the story that only the reader can discover in his mind.<br /><br />The prose though pretty long drawn at the beginning gets interesting after the adventure on the sea starts. The survival of Pi on the seas with the tiger (Richard Parker) is well fleshed out. Pi's Crusoesque voyage and survival forms an interesting tale. But at the end, the narrator (Pi himself) presents an alternate look at the story and gives you the option to choose the one you want. That's when I realized that the story is not really a story at all! It can be seen at many levels with many meanings. And that is when I really liked LoP.
B0006399FS|5.0|The album is excellent.  After being immersed in (mostly rock) music through college, I haven't listened to a lot of new stuff in the past 15 years.  U2's sound on this album reminds me of the Joshua Tree, one of my all-time favorites.  There really are no throwaway songs IMO.  Bono's voice still grips me, and the chords and lyrics are outstanding.   <br /> <br />As a Christian, I never have been able to really figure out Bono, who I believe claims to be a Christian, yet supports some ecumenical, world-oriented causes.  I am struck that 17 years after Joshua Tree, he is still asking some of the same philosophical questions, and expressing a yearning for something beyond this existence. <br /> <br />As I approach my 40s, rarely am I taken with any new album, TV, movie or other media.  But I have literally played this CD five times in two days.  It is exceptional.
B000002AZ8|5.0|as first i didnt get songs such as bugs/ foxy mop/ etc.. but you have to listen to this album as a whole/ then it makes perfect sense/ vitalogy is awesome/ eddie vedder wrote some of the best lyrics of his career and truly moved me to tears many times when i finally gave this cd the proper chance/ bravo pearl jam/ brilliance
B0000TLA9G|3.0|Axl and Slash had nothing to do with this release. In fact Axl went to court to try to stop the release of this. But corporate music will not be stopped and the greed of the record company strikes again.<br /><br />We already have all these songs, we've listened to them for years. You would have to have a lobotomy to purchase 'Welcome to the Jungle' again. My all-time favorite Guns n Roses song was 'Mr. Brownstone' which is not on this CD, but why would I buy it again and put money in the pocket of some schmuck in a suit?<br /><br />There is one song on here that's not new but was previously unreleased, a cover of the ROlling Stones 'Sympathy for the Devil'. If you feel you need to buy this whole CD for that song, I guess that's your decision, but why not just download it like the rest of the world did?
B00005YW4H|5.0|I just got this today as a Christmas gift. I love every song!!! She is a wonderful artist and has the most relaxing voice!! This is an album you listen to on stressful days!!! Curl up by the fireplace with a good book and blanket with this CD playing and you will forget all your troubles!!
B00005JNJT|5.0|I was only a child when the first Batman came out, and I was immediatley obsessed with it. Now that I'm older I still think it's the only one in the series that is worth seeing. Part two was ok, but still not nearly as \\"believeable\\" as 1. (Who could top a Jack Nicholson performance?) Thank goodness that this is a new Batman series. The world could have never survived another George Clooney head-wobble accompanied by the infamous Bat-nipples. Thanks for the memories, Shumacher. Bale does an excellent job, as does Neeson, (always great) Katie Holmes (which I loathe) actually does a good job in this movie. I could live without seeing her in the next one. The one-liners were at a minimum, but still there. But it was 1,000,000% better than \\"4ever\\" and \\"B&R\\", which was one-liners from begining to end. Is it possible to have a super-hero movie w/o the one-liners? A promising start to a new series. I look forward to the next film.
B000669GAI|5.0|never has a greatest hits collection captured a bands catalog as well as this does/ its divided in 2 sides that shows how diverse pearl jam is/ i bought this for my friends and it made them all fans/ rock on pearl jam!
B00067BBQE|4.0|Now don't get me wrong, I'm a HUGE Evanescence fan and I LOVED the DVD. It's great that they made the videos available on the DVD, Amy Lee's voice is amazing and the concert is great to watch, and the Behind-The-Scenes parts really show you how real Amy Lee really is; it's great to see her goof around.<br /><br />The only problem I had with the DVD is that the footage and compilation aren't done the best. (I do video production myself...) With the short duration between cuts, it's sometimes hard to see and a little too fast-paced to soak in. BUT I did still enjoy it very much, it's not THAT bad, and most people (especially if you're a die-hard fan) probably will not notice or care about the footage cuts.
B00000HYXB|5.0|This is probably my favorite Blind Guardian release, but that's only a matter of opinion and most of them could be argued as the best because they are all so great.  <br />This is a concept album about JRR Tolken's the Silmarillion. The lyrics are very confusing, but what little I understand (I haven't even read the regular LOTR books) I like. The music is wonderful and the fantasy subject matter works perfectly with it. <br />Every member of this band is top-knotch. Hansi Kursch is one of my favorite power metal singers, his voice is unique and excellent. Andre Olbrich is a great guitarist, his solos are impressive and intriguing without making technical prowess the central aspect of the music (while it is definitely present.) Marcus Siepen is an excellent rhythm guitarist, and the harmonies in Blind Guardian demonstrate that this is a great guitar tandem. Thomas Stauch is one of my favorite drummers. You'll just have to see his work for yourself. He is perfect for the band, and highly talented. His creative use of the double bass is great. <br /> <br />Every song here is excellent, and I like the interludes of voice acting and folk things. Don't stop here though, buy all their albums! The following album, A Night at the Opera, is wonderful and highly symphonic. The 5 previous albums (Imaginations From the Other Side, Somewhere Far Beyond, Tales from the Twilight World, Follow the Blind, and Batallions of Fear) are excellent as well. FtB and BoF are speed metal with power elements, and the following three are traditional power metal similar to Helloween's style.
B000002LIM|5.0|There are 3 factors that made this gem of a movie into a classic. Michael Keaton as the only believeable Batman thusfar, I shouldn't even have to mention Jack Nicholson's scene-stealing performance, and this immaculate score. This is emotionally charged, heart-pounding, musical accompaniment at its finest. There are some good movies out there with terrible scores, and turned them into mediocre movies. I don't know who is doing the score for the new movie, but he's got his work cut out for him.
B00006M183|5.0|i was losing hope in albums around this time period/ but riot act really saved my hopes here/ pj proved that theyre still relevant and have given something for old school music lovers like me to cherish, bravo pearl jam/ songs are better live though
B00005JNEI|1.0|If you watch this you should atleast give the other side a chance by reading some of the criticisms of the movie. Moore is notorious for lying and misstating; this movie is no exception.    \\"Hoorah\\" for trying to bring the man down. [...] for being shadey while doing it.
6305364648|4.0|Schwrzenegger laughs at Schwarzenegger (and Jamie Lee Curtis laughs at Rambo). It is surprising when you look at the paralelism with this movie and \\"Demolition Man\\". Stallone laughs at Stallone and Sandra Bullock laughs at Schwarzenegger. I'm refering to two scenes of both pictures: in the first, Jamie Lee Curtis says she is married to Rambo and in the second Sandra Bullock tells Spartan Arnold is the President of the United States. <br /> <br />Besides this, the film is a acidous criticism of all action movies. How can you do this? By abusing of action scenes. The summum is when Helen (J.L. Curtis) throws a gun down the stairs and it begins to roll and shoot killing more than 20. It is deliciously ridiculous! <br /> <br />More than the plot, which is really enjoyable, the gags are in every part of the film but one of the best is the scene in which Harry (A. Schwarzenegger) dances with Helen. Sorry, he doesn't dance: he intends to move his body in a way he almost follows the rhythm of music. <br /> <br />Arnold and Jamie make a good acting part. Not considering Schwarzenegger an actor, in this movie he makes his best performance ever, which reminds me at \\"Kindergarten Cop\\". Personally it is more enjoyable to watch him in comedy films (\\"Twins\\", \\"Junior\\"), than in pure action films (\\"Predator\\", \\"Terminator\\"). But in this one you get the best of both. <br /> <br />It is a good way to spend the afternoon. Go for it.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|The sequel is not as good as the original, but it has a lot of action and brings you up to date. Is there going to be another? Could be, but not clearly so. The acting is decent, the filming is good, the car chases are classic old school. Good filler film.
B000002BYD|5.0|this is one of my fav pj albums for lots of reasons/ they really showed both a youthful and mature side to them/ and their songs felt very epic and classic as they usually do/ i listened to this on a roadtrip/ and for a title such as yield/ it certainly didnt/ i had it on repeat almost the whole time
B00005JMAH|3.0|While I do have complaints on the film, this DVD's most annoying feature is the lack of consistancy with the last two. While this is merely technical, I am not fond of the new packaging, and am highly dissapointed that it has strayed from the box-set versions presented with the last two. <br /> <br />As for the film, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a wonderfully entertainign film, but if you are a fan of the books, you wil be too obsorbed by the text, with fair reason, to be able to enjoy the work done. JK rowling wrote a book,a dnyou must decide weather you find see it fit to change that story the way this film has. I personally am on the fence. <br /> <br />All together, it is a must have for any hard-core potter fan, even if you find yourself at a bridge of dissapointment ont he films focus. For those \\"not-so-harry\\" fans, you will enjoy this film with great pleasure, but the story may be at a loss to you have you not read the books. Even if you have seen the other two films, both were overly focused on following the text, and hard for the non-harry readers to follow at times.
0156027321|5.0|Life of Pi is a novel about a boy who is stranded at sea for over two hundred days.  It starts with some background about the boy's past that may bore some readers, but I found it very interesting, especially his religious fiascos.  I have a few friends that found the first fifty or so pages too boring to get through, but do not let that discourage you... the books plot unfolds soon after, and you will not be able to put it down!  This novel is uplifting and Pi's strength and courage is amazing to see.  This is a truly well-written book that is good for a variety of people!
B000002HRE|4.0|well this isn't master of puppets or ride the lightning or any of those great albums of theirs from the 80's but its a lot more than i expected when i bought this. maybe better than load or even the black album, which I'm not too big a fan of. very strong album and good except maybe for low mans lyric. i suggest buying this one, if you like metallica, at least their 90s music.
B000002BFZ|5.0|pearl jam really surprised me when they released this one/ i shelfed it like alot of people did but shouldnt of done/ 2 years later i gave it another chance and fell in love with its weirdness/ bravo pearl jam
B0001YRVN4|1.0|5 Stars for the originals....<br /><br />I join with the other purists in the opinion that these movies should not have been updated to fit in with 'episodes I, II, and III' The most recent movies....ahem...cartoons.<br /><br />I still love these movies, though.  Just a bit disappointed in this boxed set.<br /><br />I watched these movies on a 36\\" screen.  I think that Lucas must have had them edited on small screens or something.  Jabba looks like a cartoon which is being played on a screen in the background, and that scene with Greedo just looks like amateur editing.  They couldn't have possibly looked at this on a decent sized screen when it was finished.<br /><br />I PREDICT;<br /><br />1)  There will be further meddling as Lucas combines ALL of the movies (including the upcoming Episode III) into one big 16 hour movie.<br /><br />2)  The ORIGINAL movies (in this boxed set) will be released in their original form as yet another DVD boxed set (I know that Lucas himself wrote that they will never again be released, but money drives this series now)<br /><br />3) Someday, there will be a 7th movie.<br /><br />4) There will be a remake of one or all of the original three movies.<br /><br />5) There will one day, be about 50 releases of these movies out there.  Not 50 versions of the movies, but different releases.  Platinum edition,  original re-release, original release platinum edition, etc...)<br /><br />6) Star Wars, the musical....
B000001ELR|1.0|Goodness, gracious.  If this music didn't come from the darkest pits of hell, then I don't know what else did.  This music is from KISS, a band that praises Satan and blasphemes our Lord.  Music like this makes me agree with Tipper Gore. [...] Please avoid and buy Britney's \\"Greatest Hits\\" instead.

B0002ZDVEU|1.0|While watching the first minutes of the movie, I began counting seconds between cuts.  The consistent rhythm of the movie is one cut every three seconds, more if there is anything actually happening.  Bourne could be sitting on a beach.  There's a cut of his profile, the seascape, the unwashed travellers parading the strand, back to Bourne, lets get an X-Ray of him so we can look at him from inside as well.  Ok, so the director is a total piece of rubbish, I say to myself.  So I have to \\"watch\\" the movie by looking away from the screen.  So  the fight scenes are covered in such a disjointed way as to make it impossible to tell who is doing what to whom at any point in time (\\"he's... he's got his leg... no, wait, that's not Bourne... he's... its some kind of joint lock... no, that's a lamp...) so the movie is unwatchable trash, in other words... so what? Weeeeel, it also turns out that the writing is utter drivel.  The CIA is apparently an organization with no chain of command whatsoever.  In any \\"meeting\\" - which is a loosely constituted group of three or more employees, everyone just mouths off and says the first thing that comes to mind, regardless of rank.  Nobody is in charge.  It is just a free-for-all of self-expression, with people basically just getting hot with eachother and getting emotional, saying things like, \\"You act like you're reading this out of a book!\\" and then stalking off.  I guess liberals think the entire world operates like they do.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|wheres crazy mary and angel?/ still/ even without those/ you need to add this doubledisc to your collection no matter how big of a pearl jam fan you are/ the 2nd side is better than the first/ but the whole thing is great really/ a little weird at times/ but what pearl jam album isnt? bravo pearl jam
B00005JNEI|5.0|Michael Moore is no doubt a total idiot.  If you listen to anything he says I feel sorry for you.  It is sad to see people watch this movie and believe it.  It is also sad to see this movie get the acclaim it did.  The media is liberal and so are people who aren't very educated.  Have you ever noticed that people who complain a lot, or who act like they are victims in this world are democratic and love Moore.  Michael Moore's movie is certainly not a documentary because it is tons of lies and opinions. If you liked this movie see \\"Farenhype 9/11\\".  See both sides of the argument and you will see who the right one in this battle.  Mike's an idiot, and so are you if you like this anti-american, lying, dirtbag.
B0000028UK|5.0|vs. doesnt quite measure up to their next album/ vitalogy/ but its energy is unmatched/ people think ten was their masterpiece? naw/ vs is/ what band came out with an album that has more energy than this? no one/ rearviewmirror is heartbreakingly brilliant/ bravo pearl jam
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|MAKE no mistake, this is one hell of a movie! Gritty, realistic, creative and so fast moving it will leave you gasping for breath. Matt Damon excels as Jason Bourne, ex-Company officer and covert terminator with a sixth sense for danger and almost superhuman powers of observation and recall. The fight scene with another officer from the defunct \\"Treadstone Project\\" is gut wrenching in its intensity and realism as the two adversaries fight to the death like modern gladiators..but here there is no Colosseum. Using improvised weapons from rolled up magazines to telephone wires and kitchen knives, the garotting scene may leave some sick to the stomach but the undeniable realism and superb acting is really outstanding. The way Bourne blows up the house with a newspaper and bread toaster as an improvised time bomb is very impressive, although the explosion is over dramatised a la Hollywood. Note that when bullets hit metal in real life, no sparks are emitted; that too is pure Hollywood. Bourne is the clean cut straight American Eagle scout, who in serving his country in the back alleys of the world has become almost Frankenstein's monster, and in many scenes the anguish of the tortured character comes through. His two hand grip of the handguns he uses in the Weaver stance is very professional, and the icy coldness as he carries out his daunting task to avenge his wife and clear his name is very true to life. When it comes to life and death, emotions have no place and only serve to distract one from the task ahead. Bourne's multi-lingual capabilities also help him to survive as he travels all over Europe with a mulititude of false passports and identities. As in all good spy thrillers, nothing is what it seems, so be prepared for the twists and turns of the convoluted plot. The on location scenes in Germany are excellent and the acting of the supporting actors and actresses are well directed. Not since Steve MacQueen's Bullit have I seen such a good no hold barred car chase through the streets of Moscow. The funky music is not all that great but it is not too bad either. The somewhat alcoholic Russian FSB assassin not only needs a shave but is very grumpy and bad tempered. No wonder he got killed. Such lack of control can only lead to failure. German actress Franka Potente of \\"Run, Lola Run\\" fame is killed off early and so Bourne is left with no love interest for the rest of the movie. Her death leaves him so sad that no tears are shed but his grief shows in his steely determination to exact retribution and get justice for both of them. This espionage movie has no love angle to get in the way or distract from the fast paced action. Please catch this movie when you feel your life is boring. It will put some excitement back into your life. The best part is all the bad guys get to die...horribly. Well, as they say, God will always give us Justice, one way or another. Enjoy!

B0000085N4|5.0|\\"This is where it all ends..\\"  what a great line to start such a great album!  The cult have produced a number of really great albums but this stands as the high water mark in my opinion.  It has been described as gothic/psychedelic by some and this probably makes sense.  It combines the big guitar riffs of the `Electric' album with the psychedelic tweaks of the `Love' album and throws in full-on vocal intensity and memorable lyrics.  Put simply, this is just an album of great rock anthems, with fantastic scratchy psychedelic guitar riffs.  You just have to hear `Sun King', `Fire Woman', `American Horse' and the rest, to believe them.  Nobody makes music in quite this way, other than the cult.  Overall, this is simply one of the best rock albums I've gotten into.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|If deadpan humor goes over your head, you should stay away from Napolean Dynamite.  The comedy is brilliant.  The writing is great.  It is understated, dry humor though.  Think of Wes Anderson movies like Rushmore and Royal Tennenbaums - it's in that genre of comedy.  If you want prat falls and sight gags, you are better off with any Jim Carrey movie.   <br /> <br />In short - you'll either love this movie or hate it.  No middle ground for this one.  I personally love it.

B000063DFN|5.0|<br />Fans of Iron Maiden already own this masterpiece so this review is for the uninitiated. <br /> <br />If you are only going to buy one Iron Maiden album (not a good idea, btw) buy Powerslave.  I bought this on LP when it was released and loved it.  I was only 14 at the time so my musical tastes were in the developmental stage.  But I knew what I liked and what gave me chills.  Doubled up lead guitars, operatic vocals, heavy and melodic bass, thundering drums, well-written lyrics about mysticism, sword fighting, etc., is what gave me chills.  It still does now at 34.  Let's look at the tracks. <br /> <br />Aces High - Classic Dave Murray guitar part here, along with Bruce wailing away about dogighting pilots.  A solid intro song but the best comes later. <br /> <br />2 Minutes to Midnight - This was played a ton on the radio back when the album was released so I got a bit sick of it.  But not anymore.  Fantastic guitar work here, though subtle compared to other tracks. <br /> <br />Losfer Words (Big 'Orra) - Listen closely to the bass on this instrumental.  Steve Harris knows his business.  Being a guitarist I didn't pay much attention to the bass as a kid.  I do now and Harris' playing on this track is amazingly solid. <br /> <br />Flash of the Blade - Great riff, great vocals, and it's about sword fighitng.  Tell me there is anything wrong with that. :) <br /> <br />The Duelists - More sword fighting!  Enough said. <br /> <br />Back in the Village - I love this track.  The guitar intro is absolutely incredible.  Great vocal melody, as well. <br /> <br />Powerslave - The title track is not my favorite but is still considered great epic style Maiden.  I'll admit to skipping this track from time to time though.   <br /> <br />Rime of the Ancient Mariner - This song alone is enough reason to buy the CD.  It is a tale told to music and that is what I love about heavy metal in the first place.  It is very long so listen carefully and enjoy the whole piece.  If youdon't like it then you probably won't like anything by Iron Maiden so move on.   <br /> <br />Take care and rock well.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I have spent the last year analyzing this album. It has been in my car and on my computer almost everyday since i first picked it up in January 2004. I saw them on tour twice post album-release and even talked to them backstage at Universaly Amp. in Sept. My conclusion: <br /> <br />This album is beyond brilliant. Many people have argued that the solos are repetitive and that the lyrics fall short of expectations. At first I agreed with these views. The first couple times I listened to the album, I proclaimed that Dream Theater had missed. I even refered to it as their \\"St. Anger\\". <br /> <br />Then, after listening to it more and more, it finally clicked. I began hearing things I had never heard the during the first listening sessions. ALL DT fans have gone through this routine - of picking up new things and uncovering meanings within the songs with each new listen - like a Tarantino film. <br /> <br />Skeptics: STOP COMPARING THIS TO OTHER DT ALBUMS AND SIDE PROJECTS. STOP IT NOW. Any REAL Dream Theater fan knows that these 5 extraordinary musicians have the ability to explore multitudes of musical styles, and the fact that DT is able to successfully write a dark/heavy album such as this after releasing a concept album (SFAM) and a more jazz/fusion album (6DOIT) is testimony that this band KNOWS HOW TO DO THINGS.  <br /> <br />The key to enjoying this album is TIME. It may take up to 10 listening sessions to finally appreciate it, but believe me - when you do you will not want to stop listening. Although I personally do not think this album is DT's best (In my opinion that's a tossup between Images and Words and Scenes from a Memory), Train of Thought is an enjoyable whirlwind of musical virtuosity and exploration.  <br /> <br />I am so glad that in a dark age in musical history, where bands such as the White Stripes are rewarded for their \\"talent\\", that bands such as Dream Theater stay dedicated to progress and musical development. <br /> <br />This album belongsin the cd players of any true music fan.

We will also, meet those who knew too much about them and carried their secrets to their graves.<br /><br />However at the source of this book is Cathy Ames who will be responsible for their good or bad future in an indirect way.<br />A page-turner that will keep you up all night.  If you haven't read any other of John Steinbeck's books, please get your hands on The Grapes Of Wrath after this one.  It is something to write home about.<br />Rewiiewed by Heather Marshall Negahdar(SUGAR-CANE 26/12/04)
B000021XS0|5.0|Words cannot describe this album. Not only do they write beauitful songs, but Dream Theater has inspired so many artists to reach for a higher level, and in my opinion, that is the mark of a great band. After listening to this I practiced guitar for days on end.  <br /> <br />When I say that words cannot describe this album, I'm being serious - I really don't know what else to say about it. All I can say is that it's one of those albums that changes your perspective on music forever.
B0001XAPX8|5.0|This movie does a good job of showing the dangers of ignorance & racism. This movie exposes how much havoc such narrow minded folk can cause.  For this reason alone, I recommend this movie.  I also recommend it because it's a good story and the acting is top notch!  Enjoy!
B0002OERI0|1.0|Although this album is a change in direction and style for Green Day, it is testimony that they will NEVER mature or progress as musicians. My sister made me listen to this album, and I agreed, having been very familiar with previous Green Day work. I was thoroughly dissapointed, and the fact that this release has attracted so much praise and airplay highlights the pathetic state of our musical mainstream. <br /> <br />This album claims to be a \\"conceptual rock opera\\" boasting 9+ minute songs. However these 9+ minute songs are nothing more than extended versions of their 3 minute, power chord driven songs. <br /> <br />There are no intricate harmonies or melodies anywhere on the album. The guitar hardly ventrues beyond the power chord. The bass just mirrors the guitar. The drums are boring and predictable. The lyrics, although radio-friendly, are abominable. Billy Joe simply creates vocal lines by making stupid words rhyme in an immature fashion. If you don't believe me just read the lyrics in the cd booklet.  <br /> <br />How people continue to listen to this band is beyond me. They lack the ability to progress with their musical skill, despite having played their respective instruments for 2 decades. They sell records only because they hide behind their \\"punk\\" image that has deteriorated into more of a 14-yr old girl \\"pop\\" following. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of music, please look elsewhere. Try picking up an album from the progressive scene or from an emerging hard rock band.   <br /> <br />If you are a senseless 12-yr old with no desire to explore more tastefull and inspiring music, by all means purchase this pathetic excuse for noise.  <br />
B000687M48|5.0|For starters, I would like to make sure everyone is aware that the unreleased track \\"Missing\\" is actually a previously released track from their first CD Origin, and will possibly be re-released on their next cd. <br /> <br />I rate this DVD/CD with 5 stars unabashadly, even though I did find some slight problems with the editing of the concert. Evanescence is an amazing performer on their own- there was absolutely no need for so much editing. <br /> <br />The cover of \\"Thoughtless\\" by KORN from their beloved Untouchables album is to die for. They did quite a few covers on their tours in the past year and a half that would have been great to hear on this DVD, but it was still worth it. <br /> <br />Being an avid concert goer, I was able to see Evanescence here in Washington, D.C. all three times they came- so this DVD hit home for me to see Behind the Scenes coverage of a couple \\"mishaps\\" that happened while they were at DAR Constitution Hall (namely the guy who jumped on the stage from a side balcony during \\"Bring Me to Life\\"). <br /> <br />If you are a true fan of Evanescence, you'll love this DVD/CD for it's true Amy Lee value, and will cherish it as a collectible.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|It could be called a habit, it could be called an obsession...I call it love.   <br /> <br />I had heard about \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" about a year ago.   <br />And, as always with ANY film dealing with the Living Dead, the anticiapation grew.  Over the years, since George Romero's \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" drew my attention, I had used Romero's films as a basis for what a 'good' zombie film should look like, feel like...(taste like?)... <br /> <br />Normally, when it comes to horror mixing with comedy in films, most viewers are disappointed.  There's a 'recipe' for integrating these two genres, and most outcomes are disasterous.  I must admit that I prefer straight-up horror; I love the feeling of my adrenaline racing, the feel of encompasing darkness surrounding me in a theatre as I watch the story unfold.  But, occasionally, a film will slip through that cover and hit me because of it's unique style, with such force, that I have to admit that, yes, the two genres can work off of one another...It just takes a director with great timing, actors who can deliver the lines with superb authority and a pace that draws me in as a viewer. <br /> <br />With \\"Shaun of the Dead\\", I found all of that...And more! <br /> <br />As a parody of Zombie films, and playing off George Romero's \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" title, \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" introduced us to the title character, Shaun.  Following a typical day in Shaun's life as a retail clerk, the audience is introduced to a cast of lively characters (well, in the beginning they are alive).  The director uses a number of quirky relationships to play off one another as the world starts to fall apart, and the dead begin to walk.  A number of times, I sat there, feeling that, maybe, just maybe, Shaun was starting to catch on to what was going on in the world around him, but, no, Shaun just...well, he just didn't get it.  With this, it was the timing that worked, the delivery of the lines and, all in all, the reactions of the actors to the environment and situation that made the scenes work.   <br /> <br />Peter Jackson brought us \\"Dead Alive\\" a few years back.  A film about the Living Dead, splashed with comedy, \\"Dead Alive\\" succeeded in following the 'recipe' for combining the horror and comedy genres.  With \\"Shaun of the Dead\\", we have seen success again.  Sure, there are moments of horrific violence, but it's done in such a light-hearted way that you can't help but smile as a girl falls back on a metal pipe which pierces a hole several inches wide in her stomach.  The blood is gratuitous at some points, but neither the horror aspects, nor the comedy aspects, distract from one another. <br /> <br />This past week I picked up a copy of \\"Shaun of the Dead\\", brought it home and watched it...and watched it again...In five days, I had watched the film eight times.  In fact, writing this review has gotten me so fired up over the film again, that I'm going to pop it in and watch it again... <br /> <br />Hold on... <br /> <br />There we go.  Anyways, I need to go make some popcorn.  I have an EXCELLENT film to watch...Again.
B00004Y6NV|5.0|\\"On Every Street\\" is distinguished by mellow country sounds. \\"On Every Street\\", \\"When it Comes to You\\", \\"You and Your Friend\\" and \\"How Long\\" feature wonderful interplays between Mark Knopfler's guitar and Paul Franklin's pedal steel.  This is the kind of atmospheric music you might enjoy over a snifter of good brandy on a cold night while contemplating the problems of the world.           The up-beat rock tunes, \\"Heavy Fuel,\\" \\"Calling Elvis,\\" and \\"The Bug\\" are good, but not exceptional and I quickly tired of listening to them. \\"Iron Hand\\" is dramatic, and some of the other songs on the CD are cocktail-lounge blues -- intimate, smoky, and augmenting the melancholy atmosphere of DS's last studio album.  \\"On Every Street\\" didn't sell as well as the megahit \\"Brothers in Arms\\" but the music is just as good.

B000244EMO|3.0|I was so excited when i heard that they were re-releasing the Predator dvd. But boy was i upset after finally seeing the finished product.<br /><br />The original movie is still superb and is one of the greatest cult hits in the last 10 years, but whats up with the dvd?<br /><br />I was hardly impressed by the low grainy quality of the dvds picture and the extra bonus material is hardly worth noting.<br /><br />The deleted scene and out-takes were terrible and arent even worth watching.<br /><br />Oh well, it is still worth it for the main feature.<br /><br />And maybe they will finally release a dvd worthy of this movie for the 20th anniversary...
B000002L5P|5.0|there is a certain freshness - or rawness to the first smiths record that i really love.. Morrissey's lyrics chart new territory into ambiguous, homoerotic(?can we really be sure though?), and poetic art music (i can't think of any other way to describe it than art).. This album is full of youth (and i do not mean that in the traditional condescending way people view youth).. It is reminiscent of the ambiguity and angst of James dean (one of morrissey's favorites).. There is, above all, a tremendous longing present here - a longing for love and acceptance.. This album contains about 4 of the smiths best songs (in my opinion) - Still ill (perhaps the best), this charming man, what difference does it make, and reel around the fountain.. Personally i would add suffer little children (which normally is not included as one of the band's best - but one of my favorites)... It does not get much better than this..
B0002OERI0|2.0|Well, it appears that this three-chord wonder group has put out yet another unnecessary album. This time, they've done well for themselves to capitalize on the anti-bush, pro-liberal sentiment, pumped into the minds of their fans via the pitifully liberal music video corporation. They've chosen to make anti-pop music that is anything but anti-pop.  Here is another example of a dwindling pop band hanging on for that last cash-in.  People, true punk rock is long gone.  Neither Green Day, nor their fans have anything to whine about these days.  It's just a shame.
B000002LOM|4.0|This album is not bad at all! 'Sing Your Life' is a classic, 'Driving Your Girlfriend Home' is pretty good, and the controversial(?!) 'Asian Boy' is one of my favorites. All in all this is a pretty good album - with one of Morrissey's best album covers (Maladjusted and Southpaw suffer from bad covers). I like this one - while it surely is not his best or his most career defining album.
B00065JTBA|4.0|Bon Jovi is an amazing band, one of the best of the last two decades. With all this time in the road, the band must improve and innovate for continue interesting and at the top. And Bon Jovi do that!! <br />First was the album This Left Feels Right, all the hits with new arranges, an other way to listen the number ones. <br />Now the band release 100,000,000 Bon Jovi fans can't be wrong, a box set includes 4 cds with 50 songs: new stuff, demo versions, b-sides and different versions. A quality material, that only a band with this reputation can make.  <br /> <br />Essential for fans of the band and everyone who loves rock and roll, with good lyrics and musics. After this release, the band will increase the number of fans, that's for sure!!!
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is one of my alltime favorite books!  It is a sci-fi adventure about an 8-year-old millitaristic genius who is being trained to save the world against a race of aliens called \\"buggers.\\" This may sound really lame, or juvenile, but it is NOT! It is a witty story, not for children, but for young adults and adults of all ages as well.  This book is not your run of the mill kill--the--aliens--save--the--world book: it is original, funny and serious at the same time, and great for anyone who likes science fiction or is an intelligent person who wants to read an exciting book.  If you like this book, I recommend the rest of the Speaker for the Dead series, but I especially recommend the book's companion series, which begins with Ender's Shadow.  I am an Orson Scott Card fan, and I have read lots of his books and short stories, but I think that the Ender's books are the best of them all.  READ THIS BOOK!
B00005LQ04|5.0|Dario Argento uses the camera lense like a prism. He focuses on familiar things and then tilts the prism, revealing hidden, unexpected facets. Despite the occasional gore, Argento films are tantalizing. Suspiria is as much a mystery as it is horror. It's fascinating to screen it for people who \\"don't like horror films.\\" Almost invariably, they end up watching it all the way through. Within the first few minutes, they get drawn into the prism, hijacked, and then mesmerized by Argento's imagery.    Suspiria's visuals are brutally poetic. The hydraulic door mechanism at an airport becomes as disturbing as a stabbing knife; an overflowing storm drain inspires dread; austere architecture and interior design become sinister.    When Suzy explores the Ballet school, following the footsteps of her teachers, she passes through a hallway of wood-slat walls and brass light fixtures before she comes to a black door. Behind the door's semi-opaque glass, a  blood-red light begins to pulse. Unlike the benign hallway, the door is done in a sort of French metro style. It's extremely organic - reminiscent of the biomechanical style of H.R. Giger.     Note the M.C. Escher wallpaper in the bathroom of the apartment where the first victim takes refuge. It's an interlocking design of identical, black and white figures - much like the dual reality in Suspiria. Escher's intricate designs are so intricate and harmonious that one has to wonder - did Escher create them, or did he simply reveal them? Much like Argento's style with Suspiria. Did he create the mythology, or just reveal it? Or maybe both?    Suspiria is full of symbolism. When we enter the inner sanctum of the coven, symbols abound. Magical letters and phrases in latin, english, and hebrew are written on the walls that lead deeper into the sanctum, along with a long vine and leaves. Above the bed of the mother hangs an all-seeing-eye in a pyramid. On a table sits an illuminated peacock, which provides Suzy with her only weapon against the evil of the black queen.    At the end of the film, when Suzy flees the school in the storm, her demeanor changes from distraught to an elated smile. Perhaps this is a normal reaction for someone in her situation, but to me it seems a little abrupt. Just for fun, I like to think that maybe this sudden change in demeanor represents Suzy removing a mask. Maybe Suzy wasn't exactly what we thought she was... If Argento ever finishes the trilogy, here's how I'd like to see this film tied into it:    Maybe Suzy was drawn (or purposely went) to the ballet school for the specific purpose of destroying the Mother there. Perhaps Suzy is linked by birth and descendance to the whole mess. Using the film's rules - which state that a black queen is 100 times more powerful than the members of her coven (and is also the source of most of their power) - it might be reasonable to suppose that if a rival black queen were to destroy another black queen (or Mother), maybe she would inherit her power? Perhaps Suzy is herself the Mother of Tears? The question then could be - Is she good or evil? Or something in between? Will she succeed in gaining the power of all three houses? If so, what are her plans? I don't know why Argento hasn't finished this trilogy yet. It is so full of possibilities!
0345298349|5.0|Gorky Park made me do something I've never done before: Go out and read every Martin Cruz Smith book with Arkady Renko. Gorky Park is still the best, but they're all good because Renko has breathed life into such a compelling character. Smith just hooked me like I've never been hooked before. They're well written and I'd put him in the ranks of Hammett's Contintental Op, another lost figure who finds redemption in the mysteries he is paid to solve. If it helps, I'd rank them in this order: #1, Gorky Park. #2, Red Square, #3 a tie between Havana Bay and Polar Star. Enjoy!!!
B00065GX64|5.0|The original Criterion Collection DVD release of M was somewhat of a letdown, the one title Criterion released that I would have wanted them to improve upon. It's picture and audio quality was somewhat sketchy and there were absolutely no special features. However, the new edition of M is a delightful surprise in every way. This masterpiece is now given the digital treatment it deserves, with minimal scratches and tears that existed before. In the previous edition the picture was blurry and it was difficult to appreciate the dazzling camera work this film exhibits, but now the image is crisp and clear as it should be. Audio is also improved as well. Now as far as special features are concerned, I was happy to hear that it was getting a audio commentary, but now it has a great range of features that help the viewer appriciate the film even more. So don't even think twice in buying this edition over the previous one.
B0006284JQ|5.0|Comparisons to Madonna's Immaculate Collection are inevitable.  Where Madonna epitomized 80s pop culture, Britney led the teen pop revival during the late 90s.  She may not be the ruthless trailblaizer Madonna was, but her impression on pop culture is undeniable.  Her biggest hits are all here so even the casual Britney fan can have it all.  Hearing the older tunes recall simpler days when teen sensations of yesterday sang about virginal love.  As Britney grew up, so did her tendency to experiment, trying on different outfits to see which one suited her best.  Perhaps the Britney album and its accompanying singles signaled this transition (the almost sleazy yet infectious Slave 4 U, I'm not a Girl, and Overprotected).  She rebounded with her eponymous 4th solo disc, In the Zone.  Once again, America was in love with her again, thanks in large part to the monstrous Toxic single.  The followup was equally impressive, her finest singing moment that is Everytime.  The main attraction for this set are her early hits with the staple Baby one More time (considered by most as her career high point), drive me crazy (remixed sounding as hip as ever), sometimes, Ops I Did it again (easily one of her catchiest songs), lucky, and stronger.  Three unreleased tracks round out the set with My Prerogative, Do Something, and I've Just Begun.  All are well produced tracks in the same vein as Toxic.  All in all, an impressive, if not premature, collection of singles spanning her 6 year career.
B0006FO9J2|5.0|This DVD of Iron Maiden is a must have for any true Maiden fan!  If you really enjoy the early Maiden with Paul DiAnno, and the first two albums with Bruce Dickinson, you will be impressed!! Great live videos, concerts, promos, and more!!  One thing though....I have purchased many items from Amazon.com, but the price they are asking for this DVD in brand new condition is way too much!!!  I bought this DVD from Hastings for $15.99 and then I got 10% off that price as well.  ( Hope you are reading this Amazon.com.)  Anyway, whichever source you choose to purchase this Irom Maiden DVD from, it is good entertainment!!!
B0001UL7RY|4.0|This is the obvious work of a talented singer and songwriter in a sophomore slump.  The album is so deep into Lavigne's inner conflicts that when the final third of the album changes perspective it fails to deliver us from her despair.  Angst and pain ultimately drives Lavigne's musical ambitions, and when the music and lyrics meet in harmony the end result is rather beautiful. Unfortunately, this doesn't happen too often. My Happy Ending is her most accomplished song to date.  He wasn't, much like Sk8er boy, is the set's liveliest moment.  Sometimes, her angst comes across as mechanical: take me away, together, don't tell me, and nobody's home.  Despite the emotionless delivery of each song, Ms. Lavigne's capable of tapping into the mass' discomfort and delivering a radio smash.  Her knack for crafting pop tunes will keep her singing about inadequate sk8er bois for years to come.
B00003CXAA|1.0|My video of the Godfather is a much better product than this dvd.  I can barely make out the what the characters are saying, but first and foremost, I expected the non-cut version of the movie.  I feel like I have been ripped off.
B00004SCX6|5.0|This is Spears' finest musical moment.  Filled with hooks, monstrous choruses, and enough virginal sensuality thrown in, this album solidified her image and identity as the 90s quintessential teen phenomenon.  Forget the fact that this album lacks any real insight into Spears inner drama since Max Martin and Rami prove that they can craft fine pop tunes, from the brilliantly silly title track to teary eyed Lucky.  Lucky may sound like an embarrasingly vulnerable moment for her but her genuine sentiment towards the tune wins both fans and haters.  The third single, Stronger, proves to be another classic tune with monstrous choruses that shape Spears' thin voice into robotic, fem bot perfection.  Other strong tracks abound, with don't go knockin, don't let me be the last to know, what you see is what you get, and can't make you love me.  Sure there are embarassing moments here from I can't get no satisfaction to Dear Diary.  But the highlights truly shine, solidifying her status as the teen sensation with the most promise to shock pop culture for decades to come.
0553573403|4.0|I picked up this book because it was compared favorably with Steven Erikson's Malazan books. Many reviews (most of the ones i've read, in fact) talk about how similar the books are to one another. I would have to disagree with those comparisons.<br /><br />Here's my analogy: books are food and the sci-fi/fantasy genre (i know, i know, it's really two genres, but that's another debate for another time) is cake. Just hear me out. Now i'll take it a step further and say that Erikson and Martin bake different kinds of chocolate cakes. I'm calling very long, very complex, character-packed stories that take place in well though-out worlds full of conflicts chocolate cake. Forgive me. So one might assume if they liked one kind of chocolate cake, that they would like every kind of chocolate. I liked Erikson's cake, but i didn't like Martin's. Erikson's is devil's food cake, we'll say, which i love. Martin's is German chocolate cake, which i don't really like.<br /><br />Why did i give this book four stars then? Because i still recognize that this is a GOOD book. It is well written, the characters are finely constructed and fleshed out and the plot is very intelligent. This book is full of complicated court intrigues, old grudges, good guys, bad guys and danger around every corner. So if that's your thing, pick up this book! I bet you'll love it.  For me, i can only stand so many bad guys in one book and only so many betrayals and feelings of hatred born from mistunderstandings. So this wasn't really the book for me.<br /><br />Enjoy what you read,<br /><br />j
006441034X|5.0|Howl's Moving Castle has been my favorite book for quite some time.  The book is a delightful combination of memorable characters, convoluted plot, and sharp humor.  Younger children should have no trouble keeping up, and adult readers will catch new details at every turn.  Diana Wynne Jones is among my best-loved authors, and this book is largely responsible.<br /><br />Howl's Moving Castle casts Sophie, the meek hatter's daughter, as our unlikely heroine.  Sophie goes through a bit of a transformation, and stumps off into the heather of Ingary to seek her fortune.  She encounters all kinds of characters, every one believably written and amusing.  The plotline of Sophie's adventure is much more complicated than it seems.  There are numerous references to characters that we may have discounted earlier, and subtle passages that warrant a second or third read.  Howl's Moving Castle remains the book that I have read more times than any other, and that's not without good reason.  I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone willing to give it a chance.
B000002UYZ|5.0|I noticed some reviewers here are moaning that EMI aren't making this a singles disc. After all, put all the tracks on one cd, rather than 2 and the CD will be half price right? WRONG! <br />Bear in mind that whether this is 1 CD or 2 CD's the number of tracks will be the same therefore the same amount of royalties will still have to be paid for. The only savings that will be made will be in the casing and if you want to cut out the artwork and make it more simple, the result would be about a 10p saving for the record buyers and a less attractive looking package. So, to all the moaners, please LET IT BE and accept the fact this album is going to cost more than other CD's regardless if it's a double disc, or on a less spectacular packaged single disc. <br />Ok, now into the musical content. <br />The Beatles are quite simply music's greatest. No other band before or since can live up to them. The only pop-rock act that rivalled what they did was Elvis before them and the only music to remain as famous is that of classical composers such as Bach and Beethoven. <br />However, back in 1962, this was all yet to come and if you told someone that The Beatles would be more popular in 2005 than they were in 1962, they'd think you were crazy! <br />The Beatles first hit in the UK (after scoring success on the touring circuit in Germany & backing rocker Tony Sheridan on some of his early records) was \\"Love Me do\\", a song in the vein of county-pop duo's such as The Loovin Brothers and/or The Everly Brothers. <br />This of course was the 1st of many, many hit's the world over and by mid-1964 The Beatles had cracked American and sold more than 40 million records, this of course, was just the very, very beginning. <br />But why after 40odd years is Beatlemania still about. The Legacy and the music still live on. Noone could answer than question in the 1960s and noone can now. The Beatles were jus one-offs, a collective group with great advisers (Brian Epstien, Neil Aspanall...) and a great producer (George Martin), with a good drummer (Ringo Starr), a fab lead guitarist (George Harrison) and fronted by two geniuses of song (The hugely talented Paul McCartney and fellow songwriter & the founder of the group John Lennon). <br />A combination of all people involved working together, the influences of fine music before them and their own magic talent and the public appreciation (or in some cases, protest) made Beatlemania what it is and what it continues to be. With each new generation comes a new generation of Beatles fans.  <br />All this (& more) is captured on this CD set and it's sister collection \\"The Beatles 1967-1970\\".
B0000B1OFN|4.0|While this is not even close to being one of my favorite movies it was decent.  I was a little skeptical of it because it seemed like it was going to be just another remake of tired themes.  However I was surprised.  The action and chase scenes are well done.  The characters are realistic and well developed and the special effects are adequate.  Overall this is a fairly well done film.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|I saw this film for the first time on DVD about eight months ago and I was completely stunned by it. He was making such sense to me because he was the first person in his position to say in effect that you must accept the consequences of your actions, but at the same time there are moments where he tries to excuse himself from some of his actions and decisions during the WW2 and Vietnam. <br /> <br />He understands the roads that led him to those decisions. Know, with that knowledge and experience, he's offering guidance. <br /> <br />His lessons actually make sense. There's been so many people saying that the White House and the Pentagon should watch this film, and I wholeheartedly agree. I've always believed that if you understand history, you understand what led people in similiar positions to the outcomes. I think the lesson that The White House should be taking notes while watching is \\"Be prepared to rexamine your reasoning.\\" I don't need or want to explain why. <br /> <br />Brilliantly edited for clarity and understanding, and not for flash. In other words it's not MTV editing, editing because you want to. Excellent score that does what all great scores do, it hightens the emotion and accentutates the drama. <br /> <br />One of the best doc's in any genre.
B000000OQF|5.0|First of all, how come most of the people who slate Guns 'N Roses, or any other rock band to come out of the eighties for that matter, are Limp Bizkit or Vanilla Ice fans?! I just don't understand! For all those posers who think Gun's suck, let me tell you something! All the more mainstream bands that you guys think are 'cool' or (God forbid...) 'metal' such as: Linkin Park, Good Charlotte, Simple Plan, Staind etc. wouldn't even BE around in the music industry if it weren't for the influence of Guns 'N Roses! You still might not like their music, but you SHOULD show some respect and honor for the artists you seem to like and proudly praise like the so-called \\"metal Gods\\" Limp Bizkrap!  Anyway, on to the review of this fantastic album. Without ever letting success or popularity get to their heads, 'Appetite For Destruction' was Gun's 'N Roses most essential album ever made!   When songs like 'Welcome To The Jungle', 'Mr. Brownstone', 'Paradise City', & 'Sweet Child O' Mine' are known by even the most uncommon of people you just know how much of an impact this album had!  Slash, although shown talent through many of Gun's songs, has incredible solo's all over this record! 'You're Crazy' would satisfy the more metal-based fans due to it's fast, energetic side. And 'Rocket Queen' is a stunning closing track!  Definitely an album adding to your collection!    Please for all the intelligent CD purchasers out there reading my review, ignore the posers and their MTV world. It's annoying enough with THOSE people actually bothering to put this masterpiece down!    Laters.
B0002Z9HT8|3.0|First off, this is by far the least expensive 4-disc anything i have ever purchased.  The set includes the videos for both We Are the World and Do They Know its Christmas as well as many of the concert performances.  Sadly, many of the performances were not included due to technical problems (Geldof yanked the wire out of his mic) or a simple lack of materials.  Apparently Bob Geldof did not want the concert to be rebroadcast or preserved in any way, and the American contingent took him at his word.  The only record of the Philadelphia shows were found in a closet somewhere at MTV.  The sound quality of the London shows is pretty good, the Philadelphia shows not so much.  Even with the problems, this set is defintly worth the price, and there won't be a better version surfacing anytime soon.  Also, all the profit from DVD sales goes back to the Band-Aid foundation, which has raised 144 million for famine relief at the time the DVD set was released.
B000002UUX|5.0|I cannot believe how amazing this album is! The guitar work is amazing! Read on for my track-by-track rating:<br /><br />1. Holy Wars...The Punishment Due-5/5-Best Megadeth song ever. The final solo alone is worth buying this album!<br /><br />2. Hangar 18-5/5-3rd favorite song by Megadeth. 11 f**king solos!!!<br /><br />3. Take No Prisoners-5/5-Very heavy intro.

Buy it for the final  solo in \\"Holy Wars\\" for that reason ALONE!!
B0002KVUL6|5.0|Campy does not necessarily mean bad. Yes, there is satire and special effects. They are not what dominates the film. For me, the high point is the writing, the story. What I really like is the way three classic horror creatures have been implemented into one cohesive story. The addition of the other three movies makes this an excellent addition to my horror library. If you don't like the movie maybe you should get off your high horse and remember what entertainment was supposed to be about.
B00067ZONA|5.0|What Genesis' single disc greatest hits, Turn It On Again: The Hits, accomplishes for passive Genesis fans, this massive 3-CD set, The Platinum Collection, achieves for the true Genesis enthuasist. Culling material from 1970's Trespass through 1997's Calling All Stations, this 40-song retrospective is as thorough as almost any fan could want.<br /><br />All tracks featured are the original studio album versions with the exception of the single edit version of \\"Tonight, Tonight, Tonight.\\" In some cases, some tracks have been newly remixed for this collection by long-time Genesis Engineer/Producer Nick Davis and sound incredible! To be honest, I've been an avid Genesis fan for 25 years, and I find it difficult to find a bad word to say about this set. Yes, it is missing a few songs I would have included like \\"In The Cage\\", \\"Watcher of The Skies\\", \\"Deep In The Motherlode\\", \\"Man on The Corner\\" and \\"No Reply At All,\\" but the group's back catalog is so extensive, that there really isn't anything I would cut from this set to makes those songs fit if I could (with the possible exception of \\"Undertow\\" from And Then There Were Three). In fact, I think most people who would consider themselves \\"fans\\" would probably ditch most of their old Genesis CDs after buying this one. It's just that good! It's fairly comprehensive, sounds great, and is filler-less! This one is a MUST OWN for any serious Genesis fan!
0792846443|3.0|When I saw the Bravo's \\"100 Scariest Movie Moments\\" and saw the little clip about Misery, it intrigued me.  I went to my local library and checked out the book.  After I finished reading it, I absolutely loved it.  I figured I should go back and see what originally interested me into reading the book.  I took a trip to the Hollywood Video and picked up the movie right away.   <br /> <br />After watching it, I felt a little cheated.  Kathy Bates' performance in the movie was nothing short of outstanding, but that isn't what disappointed me.  The movie's plot was changed pretty awkwardly.  I can understand changes made to shorten the length of the movie, but some changes were rather drastic and crucial to the storyline.  For one thing, several characters have been added.  <br /> <br />A sheriff named Buster and his wife along with Paul's literary agent were added to the mix for the movie adaptation.  The three characters partially make up for incredibly minor characters in the book (though the literary agent is mentioned).   <br /> <br />Overall the movie is a fairly average adaptation.  A lot of things have changed while keeping the basic story the same.  I suggest seeing the movie before reading the book because you might be disappointed it didn't live up to the book.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Found on [...] <br /> <br /> This CD may have been released last year, but it is worth revisiting again. Since the 2001 release of Josh Groban's self-titled debut album, featuring the global hit \\"To Where You Are,\\" Josh Groban has become a musical phenomenon, selling over five million albums worldwide. He has made numerous television appearances and his duet with Charlotte Church at the closing ceremonies of the Salt Lake City Olympics was seen by over a billion people.

His fan base has grown to international levels and they have affectionately dubbed themselves \\"Grobanites.\\"  <br /> <br />With his 2003 album Closer, his vocal range continues to soar to unprecedented heights. From the sweeping melodic opener, \\"Oceano,\\" the heart-wrenching \\"Broken Vow\\", evolving to his second hit single, \\"You Raise Me Up,\\" his vocal aptitude and talent is unmistakable. His passion applied to the lyrics \\"When You Say You Love Me,\\" is a tender ballad, a perfect song for a newly married couple to share their first dance. \\"~My Confession,\\" and \\"Remember When It Rained,\\" are two melancholic songs about lost relationships that he brings amazing depth and feeling. Even when singing in a foreign tongue, \\"All 'improvviso,\\" and \\"Hymme a l'amour,\\" Josh Groban has no problem translating the emotion of the song through the music. Listeners will be enchanted by his sensual voice and music. Though many artists have a difficult time matching the success of their first album, Josh Groban does not disappoint fans but solidifies his standing as one of the premier singers of our time.  <br /> <br />Josh Groban has also lent his voice to the movie soundtrack of \\"Troy,\\" and has a new song \\"Believe\\" featured on the Polar Express Soundtrack. His new CD/DVD, \\"Live at the Greek\\" will be released November 30,2004.  <br /> <br />At the tender age of 23, Josh Groban has years ahead of him with a voice ahead of his time. Whether you are lucky enough to see him in concert or just relaxing to his music at home, Josh Groban's music resonates in the hearts and minds of everyone who hears it.  <br /> <br />To learn more about Josh Groban, his music, tour dates, or contact information; go to [...] and sample his music directly from his website.  <br /> <br />
0330485385|4.0|I read several different types of books, but this one was different.  It grabbed my attention with the first line, and was never able to put it down.  This was the first book that I read that had the climax in the first 3 pages.   <br />Lovely Bones gives an incredible view of what someone may see from heaven.  I began to look forward to what Susie saw on earth and how she viewed her heaven. <br />This is a great novel to those who are just looking to fall into a book.
B000002HH2|4.0|I have purchased three of other Bjorks releases (Vespertine, Greatest Hits, Medulla) and this is sadly the worst (not to say It's bad, I did give it 4 stars) but this just seems too simplistic for Bjork, although I do like her dance/club songs from her debut.<br /><br />The standouts are Army of Me (4/5), It's Oh So Quiet (4.5/5 - my favourite), Enjoy (4/5), I Miss You (4/5), and Headphones (4/5) and I don't really like tracks 8 and 10.<br /><br />Some sales information for you:: Sold 3 million copies w/w, and peaked at #2 in Australia, #32 in USA and also went platinum there. It's Oh So Quiet was Bjork's greatest hit in Sales and it won numerous awards.<br /><br />79%
B000065VB0|5.0|Peter Gabriel 3 is an astonishingly creative, intelligent and emotional collection of songs and atmospheres that has continued to inspire me for over twenty years. It could well be my favourite album of all time, and that includes ALL artists and ALL genres of music. From the dark and sinister opening of \\"Intruder\\" to the chant of \\"Biko\\" on the last track, every song on this album has substance, power and quality.<br /><br />Musically, a wide range of styles are embraced with a number of contributions from other musical creative giants such as Paul Weller (punky thrashing guitar on \\"And Through The Wire\\"), Kate Bush (distinctive atmospheric backing vocals) and Phil Collins (crashing \\"gated snare\\" drum sound that was highly original at the time and an influence on much eighties music afterwards). PG 3 was recorded before Gabriel developed his \\"world music\\" sound. It has an incredible range of musical, emotional and lyrical dynamics not present in some of his later, more commercially successful (still excellent), albums.<br /><br />Lyrically, Gabriel's haunting voice covers a massive range of basic human emotions here, many of them dark. Several tracks on this album can still make me cry even though I know them inside out. Other tracks have me bopping around like an idiot! Absolutely brilliant.
B000089RVX|5.0|The first song from Evanescence that I heard was (of course) \\"Bring Me To Life\\" on the radio. So I bought the CD and listed to \\"Bring Me To Life\\" just like most people that get a new CD they list to the song that they heard from the radio or a friend. After a month or so every single song on the CD became my favorite and I never got tired of listing to them over and over again. This has been the best CD I have ever bought. Even my mom is getting tired of the CD but not me. Get this CD and enjoy Amy Lee's strong and unique voice and the music's hunting melody. Hope you enjoy!
0714843377|5.0|\\"The world's best-selling book\\" (the tongue-in-cheek subtitle), is a great little collection of ideas, suggestions and practical advice from a man responsible for many successful British advertising campaigns over the last 25 years. Although there is a practical bias towards the business world of advertising and media, this book is likely to appeal to any individual who is interested in creativity and thinking for themselves. It is beautifully designed and very entertaining.<br /><br />In the first few pages, Paul Arden encourages you to set your goals high and aim beyond what you believe you are capable of. Then there are \\"The Fundamentals\\" such as \\"Do not seek praise. Seek criticism\\", \\"Give away everything you know, and more will come back to you\\", \\"Don't promise what you can't deliver\\". My favourite is \\"It's right to be wrong\\", where Arden points out how anything is possible when you're not trying to be right. The risk is greater, you are in the unknown, but \\"there's more chance of it being amazing\\".<br /><br />A combination of \\"common sense\\", awareness, business advice, communication skills, positive thinking, a few presentation tricks and some quirky strokes of genius. Great stuff.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|Got this for Christmas, as I'd given my old copy to a buddy in the military for the irony. It's a good remaster. The songs sound much clearer on this version. Plus, it's got \\"When the Tigers Broke Free\\" on it now. Truthfully, it belonged on a future remaster of THE WALL, but it's a nice enough song, so I'm okay with it. It would have been much nicer to have \\"The Hero's Return, Part 2\\" included also. I've always liked the single version better than the album version. Oh well, I guess that's what MP3s are for. <br /> <br />If you alread have an older copy of this, and have someone who'd like a copy, give it to them and buy this new version. Otherwise, you may want to just stick with the old copy. Excellent album either way.
B0002XDODU|4.0|You have to understand that bands do not keep the same sound for every album they release.  If that was the case, there would be no variability.   <br />\\"Reise Reise\\" of course, is of a different tone than we experienced with the previous album \\"Mutter\\".  In my opinion, because of this, it only makes me like Rammstein even more.  Sure, this album may not be as GOOD as \\"Mutter\\", but it's still great.  The reason I'm giving this album four stars and not five stars is not because it's not as heavy as the previous album, but because there could be more variation between songs. <br />Still, great album and I'll rank every track individually: <br /> <br />1.  reise reise -- IMO the best track on the album.  This song has everything.  The chorus and ending brings chills to my spine. 5/5 <br /> <br />2. mein teil -- this feels and sounds more like previous rammstien.  It makes me want to go out and kill someone.  5/5  <br /> <br />3. Dalai Lama -- great song which gets stronger towards the end. It'll grow on you. 5/5 <br /> <br />4.  Keine Lust -- This is Catchy.  Very catchy.  5/5 <br /> <br />5. Los -- Probably my least favorite song on the album.  It just hasn't grown on me.  The use of acoustic guitar is awesome, however.  3/5 <br /> <br />6.  Amerika -- Catchy Mofo.  The bridge is amazing in this song.  5/5 <br /> <br />7.  Moskau -- Different.  This is what rammstein is about.  It reminds me of \\"Engel\\" in a sense.  Russian is incorporated into this song.  5/5 <br /> <br />8.  Morgernstern -- The choir is great.  I like the way Till sings all over the place in this song.  4/5 <br /> <br />9.  Stein um stein -- An eerie song.  Nothing spectacular however.  3/5 <br /> <br />10.  Ohne dich -- amazing.  This is the newest single for a reason.  5/5 <br /> <br />11.  Amour -- this song is equally as good as Ohne dich.  The verses are so damn catchy and the guitar rocks.  5/5 <br /> <br />All in all, this album is very good.  It would be a 5/5 if there wasn't any doubt in mymind about some of the tracks.  For it to be 5/5, every track would have to be strong, and the album wouldn't rely on 9/11 the tracks to stay strong. <br />Buy this album.  You can't not buy it if you're a rammstein fan, and if you're not, buy it anyway. How often do you hear singing in german?
B00005JKCH|5.0|There is good reason that Spider-Man is one of the most popular characters in the Marvel Comics universe.  Unlike many of his \\"peers,\\" Spider-Man is a fully developed character with depth and background... both of which (in the proper context) make him a believable, relatable character.   <br /> <br />As is appropriate for this movie (the first movie in what will hopefully be a long franchise), Director Sam Raimi takes the first quarter of the picture to create the core character of Peter Parker, and document his transformation into Spider-Man.  Updated for today's society, Peter is introduced as the prototypical high school geek, torn down by the \\"popular\\" students while at the same time pining away for the girl next door who is, for all practical purposes, out of his reach. <br /> <br />Fate steps in during a school field trip, changing his life forever.  While Peter initially is buoyed by his new-found abilities and what they can do for him against those who have bullied him in the past, he quickly learns the painful consequences of their misuse.  It's a lesson that Raimi successfully interweaves through the rest of the picture (and one that will continue into the second movie, Spider-Man 2). <br /> <br />Raimi has done an unparalled job of bringing the comic universe Spidey inhabits into the real world streets of New York City.  He has created a visual environment that allows you to believe such characters could, indeed, exist just around the next block.  Tobey Maguire is perfectly cast as Peter Parker/Spider-Man; he nails the essence of the conflicted soul of the character.  Kirsten Dunst and Willem Dafoe are also well cast, although I fear that Dunst was reduced to the obligatory screaming siren in more scenes than were necessary.  (As a side note, she is allowed to explore the character of Mary Jane much more fully in the second movie -- thank goodness!) <br /> <br />Overall, this movie was every bit as good as its extraordinary movie gross would indicate.  This DVD version of the film includes many bonus features and behind-the-scenes tidbits that are fascinating but sadly too short.  Commentary by Raimi, Dunst and others is extremely interesting and fun to hear; the unique pop-up commentary contains unusual tidbits that are also worth exploring.  If you watch the film on a PC, the pop-ups can also link to the excellent Spider-Man website for additional background information. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of Spider-Man, you'll love this film.  If you've never heard of him, this is a great way to gently ease into the mythos of this extremely popular character.
B000001FDI|4.0|I love this album, the but the fifteen minute last track, \\"Do What You Like,\\" is wayyy too long, and features an especially boring drum solo by Ginger Baker.  This may be the track that turned the phrase \\"five minute drum solo\\" into a joke, as in \\"How was the concert?\\"  \\"They did a five minute drum solo.\\"  Right. But aside from that, it's a really good track, and the album is a classic with great music.  Others here have described the songs, so I'll limit this review to telling you how to fix that last track.  This applies to people who upload their music onto a computer hard disc, as I do with all my CDs and LPs.  You'll need a music editing program, such the excellent Adobe Audition, which comes in very handy for fixing up lots near-great tracks, getting rid of excess applause and talking, and for removing scratches from vinyl recordings.  Load the song file of \\"Do What You Like\\" into the editor and mark the very beginning of the bass solo.  This comes at about 5:35.8 (five minutes, 35.8 seconds) into the song; the exact time may vary slightly depending on your copy.  Then mark the very end of the drum solo, where the band comes in again.  This is at 12:55.3.  Then cut out all of the music between these two points, and bingo!  You've got a really good 7 minute track.  The splice isn't noticeable between these points, and the drum and bass solos are definitely not missed.  The album rating goes up to five starts after the edit.  I hope this helps some of you.
B000021YQV|5.0|In the '80s and '90s Anthrax made metal fun to listen to.  Nothing deep, nothing too philosophical, just fun music with a great tune.  Now we've got System of a Down, after a raft of depressing crap, and the fun is back.  I mean, seriously, how can you not love a song that tells you to \\"pull the tapeworm out of your a$$\\"?   <br /> <br />Besides that, they're awesome musicians.  Metal and melody don't usually go well together, but System makes the tansition smoothly and well in each song, especially in \\"Toxicity\\". <br /> <br />Great band, great music, real talent here.  Listen, enjoy, and try not to take it too seriously.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I've always loved the LET IT BE film but felt the LET IT BE album never gave you that raw, intimate feeling the songs gave you in the documentary. The songs just sounded choppy and the overdubbed, orchestra parts either just didn't seem to fit with the songs or made them sound dated..  But, NOW we have been finally given LET IT BE the way it should have sounded...The White Album has always been my favorite Beatles album, but LET IT BE NAKED is very close. This album sounds like it was recently recorded.  It's a true great rock record.  The clarity of the songs are AMAZING!!! The band sounded so tight on this cd...Ringo's drums sound unbelievable on this cd...this is THE BEST REMASTERED CD I've ever purchased...You really feel like your in the room with the band jamming out these songs... I always hated all those strings and dated sounding brass parts on THE LONG AND WINDING ROAD--Now, I have a true, classic version of this song to listen to..Get Back sounds AWESOME and not old and cloudy like the live outside version we've been given.  I got a feeling sounds very much like the version in the LET IT BE film...Leaving out Maggie Mea and Dig it and putting it on the bonus disc and instead included a superb version of Don't Let me down was a great choice in reworking the disc...Like many, I thought the Let it be songs were great, but they just didn't shine on the album, but LET IT BE NAKED brings the world how this album really should have been like...a great last listen to the beatles as matured musicians giving it one last try before parting ways as the most influential rock bands in history...
6305971935|4.0|This is the 3rd or 4th time I have watched this movie and I still anjoy it. <br />Sit back, relax and be entertained. <br />It is still as good an entertainment now as when I first saw it. <br />It would be hard to go threw a life disruption as they did and still keep sane. <br />It is not bad for when it was made -- whether the experiment was actual or not does not affect the enjoyment. <br />
B00005JLH3|5.0|... black people were in control behind-the-scenes, in front of the camera & everywhere in between, and I didn't hear the MF word, or the dreaded \\"N-word,\\" one single time.  And, because of that, I actually liked (for a change) watching a mostly-black movie that didn't perpetuate the usual disgusting & idiotic sterotypes.  Hollywood take note: Black people can make a movie that \\"doesn't do it your way\\" and still make some HUGE money!!  Now THIS is the type of movie that I want to see!!   <br /> <br />And just what is this movie about?  It's about a young man named Devon, who comes from \\"the wrong side of the tracks,\\" that manages to use his wits & musical talent to get into Atlanta A&T University on a musical scholarship.  Eventually, though, he finds out that if he doesn't use his brain, and check his attitude at the door, he won't really get anywhere, and probably will be kicked out of this university.  Of course, he has to deal with all this while trying to fit into the musical program's militaristic-like band culture & keep a burgeoning relationship with a brainy, hot woman (who, for some reason, puts up with his \\"game\\") going strong.  In short, this film is a great piece of artwork!!  Great writing, kick-ass performances ... there isn't anything I don't like about this movie!!
B00003RQNJ|4.0|Great movie and great actors in Redford and Newman. <br />Thoroughly enjoyable  - I didn't like the stills but it just enhanced the story in its own way. <br />I like to know the why's and how's of the movie I watch and enjoyed the making of BUTCH CASSIDY feature except for the wussie language of the commentator - guess he doesn't know how to express himself with good english. <br />The locations and color enhanced the vibrancy of the movie along with the subtle humor - I just wonder what the real characters were like - fascinating.
B00064VR0W|3.0|There is a moment in this DVD, during \\"Reason to Believe\\" when Rod Stewart takes the mic and growls \\"Knowing that you lied--straight faced while I cried!\\"     What make it special is that the singer uses that great death howl that you can feel right in your very soul. It is what has made Rod Stewart a huge star and one of many things that has made him a tremendously exciting live performer. The problem is, that after his throat surgery four years ago, that growl is rarely heard in concert anymore. Ever since the surgery, Rod sings all uptempo numbers from Maggie to Hot Legs as if he's afraid to cut loose, like he may do further damage to the pipes. He still has it --you can hear it on certain numbers but more often than not, Stewart has adopted a \\"wimpy\\" style of singing that disappoints those of us who remember the pre-surgery live Rod. One does not notice it on the ballads as much (though some of them sound weak as well when he wimps out.) so he can still get away with the Great American Songbook. <br /> <br />However, that major complaint aside, those of us who have made ROD STEWART a second religon, are willing to forgive the old boy almost anything--after all, he's entertained us so long and so well, how could we not?-- and the Stewart charm is so prevelant throughout this concert, that it's STILL enjoyable. It's almost like ROD STEWART ON ICE--A CELEBRATION of a career, not quite a rock concert in the sense of what Rod could do just five or six years ago, but still a rock-like spectacle produced by a lovable rogue who has survived so much that I would imagine anyone willing to give Rod the benefit of the doubt, will give into the irrepressible wit and charisma and enjoy this show. ALSO--Rod has once again, as he has for the past 20 years or so, surrounded himself with fantastic musicians--and all of them are showcased here. They are not the Faces of course, but they aren't meant to be.  (Plus you get to see his current way-too-young-for-him blonde--Penny Lancaster--prance around in a Scottish plaid mini skirt, threatening to play the bagpipes. At 6'1 and drop dead gorgeous, it's worth the price of the DVD alone. wink wink.) <br /> <br />SO--Rod fans will love it, it is currently the best Rod live DVD available (much better than the bloodless, joyless Songbook DVD and more complete than the great Storytellers show) but this will not gain Rod any new converts. For that we will need a multi-disc set that chronicles Rod Stewart at his peak as a live performer, from his days with the Faces in the early 70s to 1998's great \\"New Boys\\" tour.

1592400876|5.0|Twenty-five or so years and many miles ago I noticed a brand new sign on a high school gym. The sign read, not \\"Presidents\\" as would indicate the name given the school's sports teams, but \\"President's.\\" I waited patiently for an embarrassed sign painter to arrive to correct the grammatical atrocity. Instead, the sign remained, indicating, I suppose, that the building was owned by Jimmy Carter or, later, Ronald Reagan.  <br />Thus I say, \\"Thank you, Lynne Truss, for helping me vent twenty-five years of frustration. And thank you for coming to the defense of our abused and battered mutual language.\\"
B0002XDODU|5.0|I first heard of Rammstein when they released their second album, Sehnsucht. After that I bought their first one and gradually became a fan. In my opinion, they keep getting better and better. I can only wonder how theyr 5th album will be. Anyway, about the tracks on Reise, Reise: <br />1. Reise, Reise - Reminds me of Mein Herz Brennt, the opener of Mutter. Good song, good lyrics. <br />2. Mein Teil - Eerie song, I listened to it for days and days when the video was released (before the album hit the stands). Nice lyrics. <br />3. Dalai Lama - Longest song on the album, it's more like a story with musical background. Excellent lyrics. <br />4. Keine Lust - The \\"perviest\\" and hardest song on the album, said to become the next single.  <br />5. Los - A necessary song, to chill off the hard riffs that appear on the album. Probably the \\"quietest\\" song ever made by Rammstein. <br />6. Amerika - Political song, \\"not a love song\\", like the lyrics say. A bit superficial, it reduces America to Coca-Cola and wonderbras, but it's pretty catchy. A must-be single. <br />7. Moskau - This one has a very good instrumental part and a bit of a rave feel to it. <br />8. Morgenstern - What I like in this song are the drums, they have this oriental feel to them that's one of a kind. <br />9. Stein Um Stein - Good song, good lyrics with a morbid touch.  <br />10. Ohne Dich - The most beautiful ballad ever made by Rammstein (better than Nebel or Adios). Probably my favorite song on the whole album. Beautiful. <br />11. Amour - Another ballad, with especially nice lyrics. <br /> <br />My opinion: You've gotta get this album, even if you have or don't have the other three. It's the best so far. Every song could be a single. As its title says, the songs take you through a journey.. Each one is different.. It's like circling the globe in 50 minutes. And you can do it as many times as you want, in your own stereo.
B000003S09|5.0|Anger not Crim brethren!! These people with their &#34;one star&#34; reviews do not even have sufficient insight to listen to anything with such depth,intensity, eloquence, and savagery as the King Crimson.&#62;&#62;&#62; &#34;They don't rock&#34;?&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60; Such a simple and shallow remark. As if that somehow negates the breathtaking musicianship of any of the King Crimson eras or players?  Go home young one and mosh to your kitchen blender. Walk not through the valley of the Crim until you have the legs to stand on.
B000003RCY|5.0|I first got introduced to Rammstein through Du Hast like many other people, however it wasn't until this year that I actually gave them a chance...and boy do I regret not doing this sooner.At the beginning when I first heard Du Hast played I liked it for how different it was, but I never really thought it was something I would like to buy because of the German language and me not knowing what it all meant.Over summer I had watched CKY2K and had once again been re-introduced to Du Hast and liked it a lot, myself being more mature and more about music. So I bought Sehnsucht. Only I wasn't quite ready to handle the whole cd and only repeatedly listened to Du Hast...call me crazy. But, my friend lent his Mutter cd to my sister over the past summer and when I first heard it in the car on the way to my step mothers work, I was blown away. The beginning of Mein Herz Brennt just totally surprised me and I was just so amazed. It was to me, just so beautiful. I had to give Sehnsucht a full on chance. And when I did, I found that I really loved this album as well. Even in its electronic glory, Sehnsucht was just as good and beautiful as Mutter. I was instantly hooked and now listen to nothing but Rammstein. Reise Reise, just coming out, really was a shock...the year I decide to become a hardcore fan, they have a new cd out...and to me that was a treat because I just got blown away by all of their music at once instead of waiting three years for a new release. Reise Reise is a great album, and many say that it is the best or that they were dissappointed. I agree with neither really. I was a tiny bit dissappointed in the fact that it wasn't as unique as the other albums, however, I really love the album. Dalai Lama, Keine Lust, Los, and Stein um Stein, however were not appealing to me at first. But as a matter of fact they are some of my favorites of the album now. But don't mistake, this album is no better than Mutter or Sehnsucht was, though it is an excellent album.  <br /> <br />   Shortly after I  bought Reise Reise, I got Lichtspielhaus, and fell in love with it. I watch it everyday, seeing as it provides me confort when I am depressed and angry. The shows, the videos, the documentary stuff, its all just so amazing, they are just so frigin awesome. I heard Du Reichst so gut, and instantly loved it. Then in the live shows I fell in love with Heirate Mich, Asche zu Asche, Rammstein, Seemann and Herzeleid. I have heard about 7 songs of the 11 on Herzeleid and now know that I MUST get this cd...not only were they just as amazing at the beginning, but they managed to be able to have the same initial sound yet very different albums all the way through their 10 year career! They are geniuses and I can't wait to see what else they have coming. To me they are the best band that exists! If you don't already have the albums and dvds then you should DEFINATELY check them out!!! And like someone else who posted, if I could I would give them 10 or more stars!!!!
B000002J6F|4.0|This is some of the best music that STEPHEN STILLS has ever recorded, along with the second MANASSAS album DOWN THE ROAD, after the breakup of CROSBY STILLS NASH AND YOUNG.  I played these 2 cds and STEPHEN STILLS LIVE for a friend (almost 20 years older than me) several years ago.  He told me that listening to these albums brought back a lot of college memories and how he saw this group play all of this album in its entirely in concert, featuring STEPHEN playing a bango on BLUES MAN.  Half of this album has excellent tunes; however, the remainder sounds like a STEPHEN STILLS solo album instead of a group recording.  Most of THE RAVEN is an excellent beginning segment.  First of all, SONG OF LOVE is a outstanding beginner with the FENDER RHODES PIANO, HAMMOND organ and guitar riffs (the high-pitch solo sounds like BAD COMPANY guitarist MICK RALPHS, or perhaps ERIC CLAPTON during the CREAM era) and the ROCK AND ROLL CRAZIES/CUBAN BLUEGRASS melody with excellent harmony vocals by STEPHEN and JOE LALA, guitar and piano riffs, ENGLISH AND SPANISH singing is a great sequel.  On the other hand, JET SET (SIGH) is my least favorite from this segment despite the excellent guitar riffs (STEPHEN on lead and AL on steel) and harmonica; however, this song sounds a whole lot better on STEPHEN STILLS LIVE album.  ANYWAY is a great rock tune with STEPHEN singing a duet with JOE LALA who plays congos and BOTH OF US(BOUND TO LOSE) is an excellent country/folk/rock/ballad that features excellent piano playing, lead, acoustic and pedal steel guitar, percussion (drums and congos); however, CHRIS HILLMAN (ex BYRDS singer and bass guitarist) should have sung the whole song himself instead of a duet with STEPHEN, especially since this is the only song that CHRIS has a lead vocal spotlight.  The ROCK AND ROLL IS HERE TO STAY segment is also excellent.  RIGHT NOW with the excellent harmony vocals, guitar and keyboard riffs is an outstanding and killer rock tune, and THE TREASURE with the harmony vocals, keyboards, lead and pedal steel guitar riffs is cool.  WHAT TO DO and the acoustical BLUES MAN are good tunes, but not my favorites.  Most of CONSIDER, along with JET SET (SIGH) from THE RAVEN, is my least favorite part of this album because it sounds like a solo album.  STEPHEN should have allowed the other musicians to make their contributions like the piano, mandolin, and pedal steel guitar, or even a banjo on BOUND TO FALL.  The acoustic ballad JOHNNY'S GARDEN is very similar to COLORADO, and MOVE AROUND that features a moog synthesizer(a mellotron would have sound a whole lot better) played by STEPHEN reminds me of THE WHO'S SEA AND A SAND from the double album QUADROPHENIA.  IT DOESN'T MATTER is an excellent tune with the harmony vocals, although hearing the HAMMOND organ and pedal steel guitar on the same song (like on THE TREASURE), was very strange to me.  However, I remember seeing the video to IT DOESN'T MATTER on MTV CLOSET CLASSICS in 1987.  I also read in DALLAS TAYLOR PRISONER OF WOODSTOCK that THE ROLLING STONES' BILL WYMAN played bass guitar on THE LOVE GANGSTER (a good song).  Most importantly, the highlight of this album is country folk rock bluegrass segment THE WILDERNESS.  THE FALLEN EAGLE, , HIDE IT SO DEEP, AND DON'T LOOK AT MY SHADOW are excellent songs with the harmony vocals, madolin, violin, pedal steel guitar and the crystal clear sounding MARTIN acoustic guitar.  I also love the sound of the electric guitar that reminds me of THE BYRDS on SO BEGINS THE TASK, along with the high-pitch harmony vocals of CHRIS and the pedal steel guitar.  My 2 most favorite songs from this segment, and probably the whole album, are JESUS GAVE LOVE AWAY FOR FREE (featuring a pyschodelic sounding pedal steel guitar by AL PERKINS, piano riffs by PAUL HARRIS, and the acoustic guitars and vocals by STEPHEN AND CHRIS) and COLORADO with the same features that just played at a faster pace with more harmony vocals.  One more statement, I also love to play these 2 songs on my 12-string acoustic guitar, and I sometimes I feel like I can fall asleep while doing so.  Then again, I have also played SONG OF LOVE, ROCK AND ROLL CRAZIES, IT DOESN'T MATTER, and others on my black and white FENDER strat guitar.  I was also thankful to find the original poster with lyrics on the back that originally came with this album.  DALLAS TAYLOR from CROSBY STILLS NASH AND YOUNG plays excellent drums thoughout this album as keyboardist PAUL HARRIS, congo player JOE LALA, and bass guitarist CALVIN &#34;FUZZY&#34; SAMUELS provide an excellent rhythm section to the band.
B0006399FS|1.0|Girl, I don't know what the big deal is about U2.  To me they're just a bunch of old white men who think they're American but they're not.  I just can't get into this music.  It doesn't sound sexy.  And sexy is what gets my attention.  This is boring.  THUMBS DOWN.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|I have started this review several times now because I can't really explain why I like this movie so much.  It is extremely funny and keeps the humor throughout the entire movie.  Even when the movie takes a dramatic turn, it always is brought back to center with a great laugh. If you like a good comedy, this movie is for you.<br /><br />The entire cast is terrific and Simon Pegg is perfect as the lovable but quite imperfect Shaun.  The disc comes with a lot of nice extras, including two commentaries.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|Ok, when I first heard of a Cinderella retelling starring Hollywood's favorite bad-girl-gone-good, Drew Barrymore, I basically lost interest. Needless to say, she is not in my top-5 favorite actress list. However, my thoughts were changed forever when I was bored one day and rented the DVD. This movie is even better than the original fairy tale told to us as impressionable kids. First off, its good that they went and told it as \\"the actual events\\" and not the same Grimm brothers load of crap that just disappoints cause you later learn there is no fairy godmother out there or magic pumpkins. Drew Barrymore's Cinderella is anything but a ditzy blonde who sings with mice and having vapid dreams of wishes coming true. THIS Cinderella actually has a mind... and uses it, too, even in the face of the prince, whose renowned charm is replaced with a rebelliousness and refusal of running a country. THIS Cinderella is way better... I especially like the fact that the role wasn't given to some unrealistically drop-dead gorgeous gal as Hollywood likes to do. Barrymore is beautiful in her own way, but not so much that it blinds us from her very well-rounded personality. The whole cast does a good job, the quarrels between Danielle and Henry are irrestible, but Barrymore's acting comes out on top here. My only beef is perhaps the narrator, Danielle's aging great-great-granddaughter, her voice is just so grating and painful to endure. But thankfully for us, we really only hear her 3 times.
B00003CXCT|5.0|i got this set trying to block out bad ratings but this set is still the best lucas arts did nothing wrong if any one is reading the reviews under me just try to block them out its worth the buy even though seeing vaders face still is a disapointment go get this
B00005YU1O|4.0|Richard Linklater uses innovative animation eye-candy where everything moves in some way and different philosophical viewpoints to create \\"Waking Life\\" and the outcome is somewhat charming and nicely done. It is basically about a young vagabond who wanders a nameless town listening to the different ideals of various strangers. Most of the cast may seem unfamiliar, as it did to me, but Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy make an appearance from an earlier film also directed by Linklater. The original shoot took about a month or less to complete while the animation was a languid nine months. But it pays off--in a world of 2D Disney animation and CG in the video game and movie category (and there is practically no gray area in between the 2) it is nice to see a unique sort of animation that is fluid and just overall nice to look at. However, \\"Waking Life\\" isn't for everyone... if you have a short attention span, you can basically wave goodbye. The characters' monologues are long and can confuse easily if you turn your back for even a second. By the end of the first twenty minutes, you will probably wish for some action to be seen instead of just talk. I also was disappointed with the ending, Linklater could do better than that. His goal is make you think but if nothing else, \\"Waking Life\\" just makes you ponder of what the whole thing was about in the first place instead of delving into the various dialogues. But, really, who could blame you?
B00005T30L|5.0|Thora Birch and Scarlett Johanson shines as recent high school graduates who are undergoing a transition to the \\"adult\\" or grown-up world.  Scarlett Johanson has moved onto working at a coffee shop (like Starbucks???) and getting her own apartment.  Meanwhile, Thora Birch as Enid is still playing pranks on unsuspecting strangers and stuck in art class she must repeat in summer school.  A case in character study, Enid, a lost ghost in this world, who view others as \\"losers\\" ultimately gets a dose of her own medicine and finds out her cynical, critical views had made her one of the biggest losers of all.  Wonderfully told film of a story that appears dark and cynical itself, but is really a morality lesson.
B0002S94OS|5.0|I won't bore you with Rolling Stone'esque passages like\\" These guys flaunt their musicianship in a way that would make Metallica weep\\" bullcrap, nor will I give you a migraine with bad spelling and punctuation while trying to bash them like \\"DooD, deeZ GuYZ suXoRZ!!1111!11\\", no, instead I'll give you a straightforward review... I love this album. Straight up, I love it. not the best band in the world, but still outstanding. Buy and enjoy. <br /> <br />For the newbies, check out Ministry, Cradle of Filth, DevilDriver, Opeth, Meshuggah, 3 Inches of Blood, Pantera, King Diamond, and a handful of others to start out. Trust me. :)
B000092T6M|3.0|\\"Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves\\" came out during the glory days of the Kevin Costner era. Of course many will say this was the beginning of his twilight years film-wise. After acting in Oliver Stone's masterful \\"JFK\\" Costner decided to take on a much less controversial role here, the results are half and half. Some have gone as far as to blame the movie's weak points on Costner's lame English accent, but that's not really the main flaw of the movie. \\"Robin Hood\\" suffers from weak screenwriting, some bad editing, photography choices and yes, there is some bad acting here. The movie is essentially a realistic take on the Robin Hood legend, much like \\"First Knight\\" would do with King Arthur some three, four years later. Director Kevin Reynolds tries to go for gritty tastes, gross close-ups and violent realism to make a \\"different\\" kind of movie. Sometimes it plays like a bad version of \\"Braveheart.\\" The writing is thin and rushes forward without giving any characters or plot points space to breath. The best films stand the test of time even in their visual quality. Here the movie is split. There are some wonderful visuals such as the myst-enhanced scene where Robin bids farewell to his beloved or when Celtic riders storm Robin's lair and he saves a woman and her baby from a flaming tree. The arrow-shooting shots are still exciting and fun and the scenes where the forest gang build their fortress and weapons are full of detail. The flip side are sequences that are edited in a choppy, almost uncomfortable style with close-ups of characters that feel either weird or out of sync. Do we really need to be PUSHED INTO the face of the nasty old witch lady? The sequence where the sheriff tries to mary Miriam is badly done again with poor close-ups, dumb action and really poor dialogue. The entire logic of all a lot of sequence involving the villains is lame. However the movie still has some merits. The scenes among Robin and his men are the best, especially when the Arab playedby Morgan Freeman helps a woman in labor give birth. Michael Kamen's score is grand and exhilarating and is still widely used. \\"Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves\\" is a curious little blunder. A movie with good intentions that doesn't quite make the mark but still has some stuff to deliver that helps it pull through.

B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Michael Jackson...what a legend. A career spanning 5 decades from the Jackson 5, to The Jacksons, to becoming the most popular artist on the planet and the King Of Pop! I recently bought this CD/DVD box set and I was overwhelmed. This is the best music collection from the 'Biggest Selling Artist of All Time' can't get much better than that! A lot of our younger generation have missed the chance to properly listen to and witness Michael's music and videos which is a shame, because I'm sure all people would marvel at his songs without the result from the negative media attention. One thing I really love is most of the songs on this collaboration are No.1 hit singles (from the ballads to the groovy dance songs.) I'm only 14 and I love all the classic dance tracks from 'Beat It', 'The Way You Make Me Feel', 'Smooth Criminal', the disco flavoured 'Don't Stop Til You Get Enough' to my favourite song 'Billie Jean.' Some of the ballads included in the set are very touching from the his child hit 'Ben' to the emotional 'She's Out of My Life.' But it doesn't stop there, there's an extra 13 unreleased songs and demos that fans will love, other classic tracks, rarities and even a live concert DVD from the Dangerous Tour. The set comes with a 64 page booklet of song/artist information with a timeline of rare photos from the Jackson archive. I must say that the concert is AMAZING!! I am a loyal Jackson fan and even I was gasping at his dance moves!! Anyway I recommend this box set for all music lovers alike because it has something for everyone. This man truly captivates the true art of music and in all it's integrity!
B00005JMAH|1.0|This movie was too long that left me wanting it to end so I could turn it off. This doesn't have anything of the first 2 movies and that was a huge disappointment. Hogwarts no longer looks like a school but a gothic castle. I lost interest in the mystery and found the characters lacked depth. Maybe the director should read the books and watch the previous films before making this one.
B000002AZ8|5.0|While Soundgardens 'Superunknown', & AIC's 'Dirt' were both extremely dark, aswell as 'In Utero'.. & NIN's 'The Downward Spiral'.. <br /> <br />I would say that this is the darkest album of the 90's... it contains a certain insanity that those other albums don't, & theres just something about the sound of the album thats haunting, like a Joy Division record <br /> <br />get it if you love dark music
B00062ZE3U|3.0|European metal always have their very own style, and Within Temptation is not an exception, and this style is indeed keep rising over the globe...  you might notice their influence on Evanescence's Fallen album, so if you like Fallen, you might want to listen to them, since they are just similiar outfit, metal riff, catchy melodies, and operatic vocal... but the fact that both the melodies and instrumentation are quite weak on \\"Silent Force\\", thru out the ablum is some typical Euro-metal riff and arrangement, a taste of greats like Therion and Lacrimosa. the vocal performance of Sharon sound very nice on this record, really show her talent and her opera and celtic influence as well..  I'd recommend \\"See Who I Am\\", \\"Stand My Ground\\", \\"Forsaken\\" will be some of the tunes that worth listening to.
B000002BFZ|5.0|What an incredible album. <br /> <br />That's the only thing I could say that would due this album justice... never have I heard an album with this much diversity.. ever.. <br /> <br />It's brilliance sums up the 90's in a whole, only pushes it to a further extreme, every area of great song writing is covered here, without any mistakes.
0446672653|2.0|Brian Weiss says that he cannot reveal the true identity of 'Elizabeth' and 'Pedro' because of patient confidentiality.   Fair enough.  But what is stopping them from revealing themselves?   What about the fame and fortune and celebrity status that would go with such an amazing story?   People would kill to get on the Oprah show for a lot less.
B0000027RL|5.0|Never has a debut album been as legendary as this album is, not even 'Led Zeppelin's first album has proven to be as legendary & impactful as this album is <br /> <br />A lot of people like to compare this album to another Seattle album made at the same time (I dont have to mention who), but while that album was like a great Pixies tribute album.. this album was simply ahead of its time <br /> <br />The greatest & most legendary band of the 90's, release their first album... that alone, is why you should get it
B00005JMUL|4.0|A young boy who has begun to doubt the existence of Santa Claus is invited to board the Polar Express, a magical train that takes children such as him to the North Pole to see Santa at work with their own eyes.  The power of this film resides in its visuals.  A process called \\"performance capture\\" was used to wed the performances of real actors to computer simulated characters and environments based on the artwork of children's author Chris Van Allsburg.  There are many magical and innovative sequences, such as the one in which we follow a lost ticket as it flutters through the air, going through a series of adventures of its own before ending up back on the train where it started.  Santa's village, which looks like a deserted Eastern European village, is quite creepy.  Christmas carols echo from loudspeakers, but they always seem to be somewhere off in the distance.     Concerning the story, there's not much going on.  The original book is quite slim, so the movie pumps up the story to feature length with lots of action-filled misadventures.  It ends up telling the story of a journey without really having much to say about it.  Furthermore, I'm not a religious person, but even I was struck by the irony of a secular Christmas story being about a crisis of faith.  In addition, this film is really not a musical, so it's quite jarring when the characters break into song at one point.  Having said all that, I feel that the visual style of the film elevates it and grants it a power and resonance that is not present in the script./
B0000028UK|5.0|This was the fastest selling album ever, without music videos... pretty amazing <br /> <br />The greatest & most legendary band of the 90's releases this intense & raw follow up to 'Ten', it has more diversity & emotion than any other album made by another other band at the time... <br /> <br />A masterpiece.
B000002G8J|5.0|All concepts of \\"Backless\\" are expressed in the \\"Brown\\" cover design. EC's vocal tone is kept \\"flat.\\" All of the songs are \\"whispered\\" by EC who sits on the sofa under the lamp. My personal favorite EC's album is \\"No Reason To Cry\\" because I can listen to his best vocal performance. In \\"Backless\\", there aren't EC's some special performances but I never feel tired of listening to \\"Backless\\" though I have already listened over 100 times. This is magic of \\"Backless.\\"
B000669GAI|5.0|This puzzles me, but I'm sure it will be 5 stars someday... <br />Pearl Jam is the most amazing band in the world, they're the gods of music, & this collection is a great representation of their work for beginners <br /> <br />absolutely awesome, can't wait for their next legendary album
B0000DYJM6|5.0|The b-sides collection from the world's greatest legendary band <br /> <br />It has some of their greatest songs, including 'Yellow Ledbetter', 'Otherside', 'Footsteps', 'Strangest Tribe', 'Fatal', 'Sad', 'Dead Man' - amongst many others <br /> <br />Couldn't recommend it enough, but if you're new to Pearl Jam, get the greatest hits first, this... should be second
B00006M183|5.0|Since 2000... <br />The music is very interesting, although lyrically & vocally, it's not one of Eddie's best.. the band is still experimenting, & now they even have a organ player.. <br />Takes a while to get into this one, wouldnt recommend it if you're new to Pearl Jam, get greatest hits first
B00004T8RK|5.0|Before this album, I wouldve called 'Dark Side of the Moon' the best space-rock album... not anymore, 'Binaural' is, it's absolutely brilliant, & very unappreciated... <br /> <br />Easy to get into? no... <br />but boy, is it worth it <br /> <br />listen with headphones
B000002BYD|5.0|How this album isn't 5 stars yet, is beyond me... <br /> <br />This album contains no flaws at all, it's a masterpiece... & proves why.. when every other band of their generation (except Radiohead) broke up out of either lack of ideas or inspiration, Pearl Jam release (amongst many hardcore fans) the greatest album of their career, & one of the greatest albums of the 90s <br /> <br />THIS album, released in the LATE 1990's, proves why they were the best band of the 90's
0385507755|5.0|Having known all too many people like Frey, this book really hit me like a hammer.  I mean, it really is a harrowing piece of work.  Like the drugs catalogued within, this book squirts you between highs and lows so fast that it's really hard to handle at times.   <br /> <br />First, one reviewer calls the tone \\"sentimental\\" at times, as though it were a bad thing.  Granted, usually it is.  But here, it works.  the book draws on Humanity (with a capital H) on the micro level.  People going beyond these horrible things they've done, the horrible things they've had done to them, the rotten lives they've led, to basically find each other's humanness.  That really sounds stupid and new-agey, but the book is swimming in this kind of stuff and there isn't one time when it seems contrived or is ineffective.  (And it may be the most convincing book about Men I've read.)  <br /> <br />And Frey's attitude toward addiction is something out of the ordinary too.  in his recovery, i loved his rejection of the group mind in favor of the solipsistic vision he follows.  he may be the only guy this works for, but it really seemed like he knew himself and knew how to recover. <br /> <br />Read this book.
B00008OWZC|5.0|Start of a 70s concert recording revival ? <br /> <br />It's always been something of a puzzle that only The Who (Live at Leeds) from among British rock bands of the late 60s/early 70s produced a contemporary live recording which really did justice to their stellar on-stage reputation. Until now. <br /> <br />Salute Zeppelin's manager, the late Peter Grant, for having the wherewithall to setup venue recording on this 1972 USA concert tour, and Jimmy Page for taking the time to remaster and organise this audio material as a tangential project to the Led Zeppelin DVD (also released in 2003). <br /> <br />No need to repeat what many other comments have already stated. It's a great sounding package. Indeed my only quibble is the near-CD worth of unrecorded space (approx 75mins) spread across the 3 audio CDs. Due to the long length of some individual tracks, the LA Forum/Long Beach concert montage would not quite squeeze on a double CD, without substantial editorial and track listing alteration.  <br /> <br />But - unless I've missed some diabolically embedded \\"bonus\\" material - given this is not a single \\"in concert\\" recording, but a digital meshing of separate concerts (the presence of bass AND mandolin, plus guitar and drums on tracks like That's The Way suggest some additional mixing handiwork), is it being greedy (given the very reasonable pricing) to expect live recordings of Physical Grafitti material featured on the DVD from 1975 Earls Court performances ? (yes, probably) <br /> <br />That said, with the critical and commercial success of this release, no doubt the executives at EMI and Virgin have been sending their archivists and lawyers away to trawl the masters vaults for Pink Floyd and Rolling Stones 70s live recordings. Could be the start of something of a trend. Garage sale Bootleggers beware.
B00005JLEU|3.0|Spirited away is a very cute fanatical film.  I did not like tho how spoiled Chihiro is in the beginning, but i guess that is what this movie is kinda based around...changing her from a weak crybaby into a stronger more independant one...which does happen...the beginning just annoys me.  I also did not like how slow the beginning is....i remember how i was sitting there watching it and going...\\"would you please hurry it up?!?\\"  All this movie had going for it really is it's comedy...when it's funny...it's funny...end of story.  I believ this film to be more suited to children around the age of 12 and under i suppose. It is very cute, but i dont think people who are older and a bit more suphisticated will like it too much....the story is just plain weird.  So..it will make a nice gift for your kids..but not for yourself.
B0000E1ALR|4.0|not much to say except that i love this set. i can't believe that there are people that say this set is no good. alot of people talk about how it doesn't have this song or that song, but not everyone is going to like every song on it. i know i dont like every song, but that doesn't mean i dont think its a good set. there are about 25 songs that i think is really good, which is pretty good out of 42. i only started to really listen to his music when i was 13 & now i'm 22, he is my favourite artist. i use to have alot of friends who never really liked him but since they heard some of his songs i play,they love him to. my favourite song is dancing in the dark.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I ordered this on Dec. 16th. It mailed out on Dec.21st and that is the last time UPS shows any tracking for it. As of today, Dec. 26th, it still shows an ON TIME DELIVERY for DEC. 23 or 24, 2004! This was my son's biggest Christmas present from us. I knew by Thursday something was wrong when the tracking had stopped. An email to Amazon assured me that it was one time - yeah right. If someone had looked at the UPS tracking for it, maybe they would have noticed that the package seemed to vanish. Calls to UPS - no good either.  <br /> <br />I wish I could get a phone number for Amazon to talk to customer service. I can only find email contact - that has not helped me yet. <br /> <br />Last purchase here.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Looking for workout music? study music? music to pick you up? This is the cd. I love this cd because it is the only cd I can listen to while studying and not get distracted. But that doesn't mean it's boring music. Quite the contrary. This music has so much movement and power that it automatically energizes you. My favorite tracks are numbers five and ten, because I can feel the power and the tension that the music creates. It's absolutely fabulous. I even used the first minute and a half for my gymnastics floor routine. If you enjoyed Pirates and you're looking for the cd that will make you feel good, this is the one.
B00009RDGA|5.0|Say what you want, but if Ryan O'Neal had never convinced director Peter Bogdanovich to cast eight-year old daughter Tatum O'Neal in the role of Addie Pray, then film history may have been irrevocably altered.    And so would have my own childhood. When Paramount released \\"Paper Moon\\" in 1973, I was likewise eight years old, and saw this great movie one Saturday afternoon. It was the first time I can recall falling in love with a screen siren, I was so smitten with Tatum's tomboy onscreen persona. She stole the show, the best supporting actress Oscar, and I'm sure my little boy's heart was not the only one she stole, either.    Although \\"Paper Moon\\" is self-consciously a \\"period\\" film, it is so without getting overly pulled into the trappings of the era in which it took place. Bogdanovich tells his story in a straightforward manner, and the only abrasive affectation I could catch was Ryan O'Neal repeatedly telling Addie to eat her Coney Island.    The story is a fun con game, which follows crooked Bible salesman Moses Pray (Ryan) and his charge, Addie Loggins (Tatum), whom Moses is delivering to St. Joseph, Mo, after the death of Addie's mother.    Early on, the audience can surmise that Moses is actually Addie's illegitimate father. It is a delight watching the two grow closer together as father and (adoptive) daughter, as the two plan cons to pull over on the marks from bill changing scams, to searching the obituaries for recent deaths, then selling the widows Bibles \\"pre-ordered\\" by the deceased at highly inflated prices, to selling a bootlegger his own moonshine that was stolen from under his nose.    Along the way, they meet a lot of suckers, a crooked bootlegger and his vengeful sheriff brother and a gaggle of hillbillies (including a young Randy Quaid). Most hilariously, they pick up exotic dancer (and sometimes lady of evening leisure) Miss Trixie Delight, played with bounce and sass by the late great comedienne Madeline Kahn.    Director of Photography Laszlo Kovacs invests the movie with gorgeous black and white cinematography that recalls John Ford's movie version of \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" in the portrayal of the dustbowl Midwest, of Walker Evans' photographs in capturing the Victorian architecture of the movie's few well-to-do and of Edward Hopper's paintings of roadside America of that bygone era.  Bogdanovich used actual locations in Kansas and St. Joseph, Mo., which had hardly changed in the 40 years since the Great Depression.    Set to a soundtrack of 1930s jazz records, \\"Paper Moon\\" gives the viewer an uncanny feel for the era, a device later borrowed by Woody Allen for many of his own movies, including \\"The Purple Rose of Cairo\\" and \\"Radio Days.\\"    This one is Bogdanovich's best directorial effort and a fun movie to sit down, munch on popcorn to and have a lot of laughs.
B0006399FS|2.0|I've been a U2 fan since the age of 11 (1983) and I really was looking forward to the new album.... There are a few well-written songs on here but overall the album leaves me cold.   Overall I think this is the lyrically weakest U2 album ever.  In addition, out of all their albums, this one has the strongest vibe of being commercially calculated - it's like the underlying spirit of their music has been sucked out.  I have listened to the whole album 3 times so far and sadly my impression hasn't improved.  For newcomers to U2 (are there such people?) - more of the songs may be seem fresh, but to me they are just musical retreads of lyrically superior songs on other albums.  Borrow this from a friend first (or listen to the songs streamed on the band's website) - and then buy Franz Ferdinand's debut album instead.
B00008J4P5|3.0|I just bought this CD today, so this review is basically a first impression. Some have been saying the White Stripes are the most amazing thing ever, while others hate them to no end. I side with neither of those two groups. I will give them more credit than some will, because they can play instruments, and there is nothing wrong with Jack's vocals.  <br /> <br />The kind of music I normally listen to includes bands like Marilyn Manson, Korn and Slipknot, so this Album is a different style and mood than I usually listen to, but I still like it. Hopefully that means something. Basically I'll listen to this if I'm in the mood. <br /> <br />Of the 14 tracks on this album the ones that stood out the most to me were \\"Hypnotize\\", \\"Little Acorns\\" and of course, \\"Seven Nation Army\\". <br /> <br />I understand why some people love this band, and I can see how others hate them, but this is a pretty good album. Not for everyone, but the same thing goes for any band out there. <br />For some reason the fact that so many people hated this band attracted me to them.. <br /> <br />(I probably would have given this album 3.5 /5 but that wasn't an option)
B0000VCZKM|5.0|i saw annie in the theatre way way back when i was 5 years old and it is imprinted on my memory forever. i managed to watch a few minutes of the new disney adaptation and i ran screaming from the room. the 1982 film version of Annie is without doubt the best version that has ever or will ever be made of this story.
B00005A46T|2.0|First of all, I am a huge fan of slipknot.  Secondly, their self-titled debut is definitely a better choice than \\"Iowa\\".  \\"Iowa\\" is heavy, just not in an original and well-organized way.  There's not much change in any of the songs as the album progresses, and the whole album just seems very linear.  While \\"Slipknot\\" was unique in that it's vocals, melodies, and riffs varied throughtout the album, \\"Iowa\\" doesn't deliver as much personality and color.  It's just all thrash - all the way through, and not much more.
B000000WZ4|5.0|being this particular release by depeche mode, the first cd i bought at the tender age of 11, which basically introduced me to electronic music and the band itself, ultra holds a special place in my heart. Without it, i would probably be listening to eminem or 50 cent right now or worse: believing that madonna and britney spears were actually talented artists. <br />when i bought the album i didn't know the story of of dm, the departure of alan wilder, the drugs, the never-ending tour of 93/95 that almost destroyed the band, i was oblivious to all of that.. <br />now for the album itself, the purpose of this review: it's a wonderful piece of art, dm ditched the rock bombast of \\"songs of faith and devotion\\" and concentrated on mood and lyrically, martin gore has some of his best moments. Album opener \\"barrel of a gun\\" with its punishing beat, processed vocals, scrath and amazing lyrics is one of the two moments were they \\"rock\\" hard (the other is \\"useless\\"). With a song like that as an opener it's with great surprise that \\"love thieves\\" comes, it's a really gentle song which displays the new vocal chops of recovered lead singer dave gahan, but it's the next song that steals the show: \\"home\\", sung by gore is a wonderfull ballad that marries orchestra strings with electronica to great effect, it's easily one the best ballads ever right up there with faith no more's \\"evidence\\" (actually they're the only ones i like). i'm not going to give you a song by song review, cause other people already did that.. so i end the review here..bye..      <br />
B0006A9FKA|5.0|When I think of people that watch zombie movies like \\"Night of the Living Dead\\", and are actually fans, I think of would-be film maker types that use words like \\"poignant\\" and \\"glorious\\" and \\"genius\\" a lot when describing obscure films that are about as interesting as my big toe.     The movie trailer initially intrigued me because unlike most movies, it doesn't show you the best parts of the movie and make you feel cheated once you watch it. However, this movie seemed sort of forgotten and I did not run across it again until yesterday I rented it on a whim.     It tells the story of Shaun (Simon Pegg) as he begins possibly the worst 24 hours of his life. His girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield) has dumped him, and you can't blame her as they never spend quality time together.  Why?  Because Shaun's roomie and childhood friend Ed (Nick Frost), is in the way. All the two pals want to do seemingly is to hang out at The Winchester Pub getting drunk. Also, Shaun's other room mate, Peter (Peter Serafinowicz)is getting fed up with Ed because he is a slacker, brings in no money, contributes nothing toward cleaning up, and is generally an irresponsible, farting slob.     So, after Liz dumps Shaun, he and Ed go to the Winchester, and pretty much close it down, unaware as they trudge through their hangovers that zombies have been roaming the streets.     From the point at which they realize what is happening, Shaun, who is fed up with being a loser, takes the initiative to get himself and loved ones out of this mess. Naturally, they hole up at the Winchester.    What sets this movie apart is that it is hilarious. The absurdity in the humor goes places that this type of movie never goes, and yet, it manages somehow to seem very natural. After all, what would you do in that situation?!    The characters are lovable, funny, and have a realness to them that generally doesn't exist in any horror movie, and certainly  not a comedy-horror. They all play off one another so well that you truly feel like they are these characters, and not just actors playing them. They have some depth to them, and while I am not claiming that they are at the level of characters in some \\"serious\\" movie, they go beyond the norm of this genre in making the heroes come to life...or death.    Even if you aren't some film maker wannabe, this is a zombie movie everyone can enjoy. This isn't a B-movie, though it pokes fun at them without losing itself in the satire as \\"Scary Movie\\" type movies have done. Neither does it lose itself in the trite formulas of horror movies. While some of it is predictable, the characters and story line show that a little more effort was put forth.    This is definitely in the Top Five Horror Movies of all time, and probably one of the Top Ten Comedies of all time for me.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|The movie Big Fish is an elaborate tall tale woven into a clasic father and son story.  Edward Bloom (Albert Finnely) is dying and his son William (Billy Crudup) wants to make peace with his father before he passes away.  What results is the story of an average man's life portrayed through a series of mythical tales.  Bloom's stories, which were often a bother for his son, depict a man whose life is often exaggerated, yet full of adventure and zest.  At the movie's end, William finally realizes the importance of his father's stories and cherishes them instead of condeming them as being foolish. <br /> <br />This movie is common of movies directed by Tim Burton in terms of its somewhat numerous and sometimes unusual visual effects, but has more heart than any other of his movies that I have seen and only has very small hints of horror (moving trees, a werewolf, etc) that are meant more to amuse than to frighten.  I would liken the effects to be of the same caliber to those in Burton's Beetlejuice, but far less scarier.  The special effects in this movie are great and make it a very lively and enjoyable story.  The acting in Big Fish is also pretty good.  Ewan McGregor does a superior job playing the young Edward Bloom and Finnely and Crudup make a good father and son pair. <br /> <br />I would recommend this movie if you are interested in a touching story about father and son relationships, life and death, family, the South, and above of course tall tales.  It is a good movie to watch with your family but even if you watch it alone, I'll bet that the end of the movie will still tug at your heartstrings.  I'd strongly recommend this one, and I doubt that you will be disappointed.   <br /> <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|People complain about Green Day not being the same as they were during Dookie or Kerplunk! They say that they didn't talk about politics then why should they now. They've grown!! they're not little boys anymore! everybody grows up and starts to become interested in other things so why shouldn't they're music reflect it? It's stupid for people to complain about Green Day changing and then to also add that they havn't matured... it doesn't make sense... <br /> <br />and as for the person who said that 99% of the media is liberal, I don't know what you're watching but here in Massachusetts (you don't get much more liberal than that) the media is INCREDIBLY conservative and pro Bush. so SHHHHH you don't know what you're talking about. <br /> <br /> Green Day kick ass, end of story. If you don't like it don't listen to them. I don't think they'll care that much.
B000002W9Q|5.0|This is album really rocks! Maybe just the first song \\"The Time of My Life\\" pays the whole value! Although you never saw \\"Dirty Dancing\\" I'm sure you'll recognize that song anywhere. The second song is \\"Be My Baby\\" (The Ronettes) an oldie song that makes people wanna dance with that special person... a nice feeling (and memories, of course!) <br />A Patrick Swayze contribution comes with \\"She's Like a Wind\\" a soft ballad not so much diffused but a nice one. Te album is completed by a mixture of very nice rhytmhs, which can be for both: listening and dancing. <br />In summary, a great album to be part of a collection, great music that will remind you \\"the time of your life\\"
B00005JKJA|5.0|This artfilm shares to my mind  the honorable place of being one of the most intelligent , sublime artworks in this raising Century .<br /><br />Lynch made his sublime masterpiece : a glorious and tastefully film with smart ellipsis , sinuous illusions , double cross , visual riddles  and circular dreams . With this superb movie Lynch reached the artistic peak of Alain Resnais (The last year in Mariembad) and Raoul Ruiz (Three cornets for a sailor).<br /><br />According to Jorge Luis Borges : \\"The night imposes us its magic task : to unweave the universe\\" so we will be the ineffable witnesses  of this memorable picture and extraordinary puzzle ; a tale of disillusions , jealous , betray , infidelity , absurdity and laceration of self esteem.<br /><br />A troubled Canadian girl (Naomi Watts) loaded with the illusion to be an actress in Hollywood will experiment a chain of  bitter misfortunes and disappointments . In this magic shining universe her light was not enough intense to shine like a crazy diamond.. She will be displaced from her maxim dream and her only love : In other words Dante 's hell  paradigm revived in Mulholland Drive.<br /><br />The revenge will be the next step which will lead to an awful climax .<br /><br />What will the undecipherable future dream?  It will dream the forgetfulness and the memory can be voluntary acts , and not random aggressions.
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|This is truly a great CD to have in your collection. So many great artists with the Great Ray Charles. A must for any music lover today. I would like to see it get the Granny this year for best CD .The Two tracks that I enjoyed the most was Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word With Sir Elton John because it brought tears to me so beautifully done and also Fever with Natalie Cole make me think only if her father Nat King Cole could have done a track with Ray on this CD. It would made my day
B000696PWC|5.0|Ultimate Kylie is a great cd with her more popular hits, as not all singles are included on here(Finer feelings, Word is out, Where is the feeling?,If you were with me now,Some kind of bliss, Cowboy Style, and Your disco needs you were some of the singles left off.) But even though it doesn't have all the singles it is still worth buying.I believe in you and giving you up are great songs and are great addtions to the cd. And it's great for US fans to finally be able to hear Where the wild roses grow. Buy this cd!

B00028HBKM|1.0|Wow, such fervent devotion to a Hollywood picture.  Of course Jesus spoke to Mel Gibson and gave his script writers enough material to fill a long movie.  Hmmm.  My Bible certainly doesn't have all those details.  But I'm NOT Mel Gibson!  I can't sucker hoards of people to worship at the alter of the big screen.  Did you ever ask yourself the question, \\"What would Jesus do if he saw this?\\"  Good question, since he was there and Mel Gibson wasn't.  For those of us who really are devoted to Jesus and READ THE BIBLE, this movie is an atrocity.  Oh well, go out and buy the DVD if you think it represents our Lord.  And while you're at it, buy the \\"Passion Stationary Kit\\" too.  It's being sold at Walmart.  No rock has been left unturned for the profit mongers.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|An actor or actress are sometimes born with a lifetime title role. Errol Flynn is the real Robin Hood VS. any contemporary versions with poor scripts, poor acting and boring special effects. The original Adventures of Robin Hood movie was fabulous especially with Korngold's music custom folded into this classaic. The only critique I could offer is they should have eliminated Flynn's beard(mustache kept alone) and had a better looking long hair wig for him. The DVD's colors and sharpness are superior to any VHS version I've owned.  <br />A must for any serious collector.
B000002JOH|5.0|When Pantera crashed onto the metal scene, with Cowboys From Hell, they expanded the bounds of heaviness, power and awesome riffage. Here they refined their groove thrash sound and made it rougher, less melodic and eliminated what was left of the cheesy hair metal singing. The result was their best album and one truly powerful record.     Every song has an abundance of great riffs and solos. All dynamic ranges are covered. In a split of the second, the late Dimebag Darrel's riffs could go from acoustic and mind crushingly heavy. Listen to the riffs in Walk, after the second chorus in This Love and Regular People. Thats something you don't hear anymore.Rex and Vinnie were also able musicians who could keep up well. Phil's vocals, cover all territory from singing, shouts, and screams.     The highlights are Mouth for War, A New Level, Walk, F---ing Hostile, This Love, Hollow and Rise. All the tracks are great though.   R.I.P Dimebag Darrel

0345457684|4.0|In this inventive fantasy the human body is used as a metaphor, used to hold and play the human personality like a DVD player holds a disc.  Life becomes no more than the passing shape of an ocean wave.  Human mortality is turned upside down for those who have the big bucks to afford it.  ALTERED CARBON must be complimented for attempting a new portrayal of reincarnation.  One can be reborn into another body (sleeve) or, if one is rich enough, into one's updated clone.  There is no hard science here.  There is no discussion of the carbon \\"stack\\" technology, no hint of how the data storage was accomplished.  Why not design the stack from more sturdy diamond crystals? <br /> <br /> To suspend your disbelief of this tale the reader must discard a whole library of thought on the human consciousness and soul.  One must discard any notion of God.  God is dissolved in this carbon stack.  Several writers, for example, Shaw and Silverberg, have dealt with the consequences of a prolonged human life.  In ALTERED CARBON the downside of living to be Methuselah's  969 years is barely touched on.  Why?  Because his characters do not share the essence of being human - mortality. <br /> <br /> The shortcomings of this novel is that the paper cut out characters could not be identified with.  In such a story it doesn't matter who wins or loses.  Who cares?  Here the end of one's life meant only getting on to the next screen.  No reader is apt to return from the dead with a new body to inhabit.  If you enjoy reading of characters used as snuff fodder to satiate bizarre sexual appetites, characters who consider humans as worth no more than cancerous cells, then this may be your best read.  For this writer the tale was prolonged unnecessarily for at least 100 pages. <br />
B00026W82U|3.0|as the Kings of Convenience sound nothing like him. This is a good record, but not the place to start with Kings of Convenience. \\"Quiet is the New Loud\\" would be an adequate starting point. I read a lot of reviews on Amazon and rarely post anything myself, but I had to after reading the John Mayer comparison. Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, Cat Stevens, Nick Drake...these are staples for which to compare modern singer songwriter types, not John Mayer. That is like comparing a great early nineties songwriter, such as E or even Chris Isaak, to Bryan Adams, Huey Lewis or Daryl Hall & John Oates. John Mayer has obtained acknowledgement from sounding exactly like an extremely less talented Dave Matthews, and really, Matthews has only put out one truly great album himself. Kings of Convenience deserve comparison to Simon & Garfunkel, Nick Drake, Fairport Convention from the past, and comparison to Ben & Jason, Trembling Blue Stars and Iron & Wine in the present.
0767834739|5.0|This movie is really excellent, I am not just another fan who gives it a good rating just because of the action and the gore, I actually look at the whole picture.  The acting was quite good, and so were visual effects.  I think that the movie lacked slightly in the story, and it wasn't as hard hitting as I expected, but it still was entertaining, made you think, and was never boring.  Excluding maybe 15 minutes in the middle, this is not as much as a horror movie as the first one.  This one has a lot more action, and a lot less tension, so if your looking for a horror movie to scare you, this would not be your best option.  If you enjoy martial arts, action, and all around coolness however, you will enjoy this movie.  Another great aspect to this movie was the soundtrack, it contained many adrenaline boosting songs, and really added to the movie.  If you are into action, rock music, big guns, an interesting story, and you don't mind violence/gore, then you will definately enjoy this movie.  A real must-see.
6300267997|5.0|I love, love, love this movie having seen it in high school when it first came out in the movie theatres!  I bought and wore out the Album (still have it) and now have it on CD.

B000002JNJ|5.0|Pantera can be described as the titans of heavy metal. After \\"Cowboys From Hell\\" was released a new era of greatness followed. The Texan quartet came out with one of the best music records in history that in my opinion would compare to Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\". Whether it is Anselmo's growling or the late Dimebag's Guitar solos, this music record should be worth a fortune because heavy metal will never be the same after listening to one track, any track for that matter, off this CD. The best place to start is the song \\"Cemetary Gates\\" even before the song \\"Cowboys From Hell\\", because the first offers so much from acoustic to guitar riffs and of course Anselmo's growling which will all resonate with your ears and help you tune into another realm of metal greatness never heard before not even metallica came close. After listening to that song moving on to all others you will notice that all these other songs back up \\"Cemetary Gates\\" with their heaviness and straight-metal qualities that makes this CD worth every penny.
B00007KWHP|5.0|As many should know by now, many classic albums in the Yes catalogue are remastered, yet again. First, we got the remasters on the Atlantic label, and as of present, the Rhino label is dishing out the remastered treatment. The Atlantic remasters didn't feature bonus tracks, but the Rhino versions do, although for the most part, the bonus tracks are disposable...or at least, they work for small curiosities.<br /><br />1972's _Fragile_ should always be considered a classic in the progressive rock genre, not just because the musicianship is virtuosic, tasteful and unique, but because the majority of it is catchy and accessible as well - something that's very rare in progressive rock as a whole.<br /><br />Jon Anderson's distinctly artistic upper-register, Chris Squire's crunchy basslines, Steve Howe's floating guitar leads, Bill Bruford's tasteful drumming and Rick Wakeman's versatile keyboard work here come together to make a unique, tantalizing brand of music. The album starts off with \\"Roundabout,\\" which exemplifies what I was saying in the opening paragraph. This track is ultra-catchy and addictive. The grooves on here (mostly exemplified by Bill's drums and Chris' bass) are hard to resist. Definitely a classic that has aged, and will seemingly continue to age nicely.<br /><br />Next comes the first of five solo pieces: The first two of the five being my absolute favorites. \\"Cans And Brahms\\" is Rick Wakeman's impressive arrangement of bits found in the Allegro giocoso (third movement) of Brahms' 4th symphony. He did an excellent job on this (and for the record, Brahms is a favorite of mine amongst many classical composers, and I've heard and own his 4th symphony.) Next comes Jon Anderson's \\"We Have Heaven,\\" which is a cerebral piece showcasing his vocal artistry. If you listen carefully, you'll find seven separate (but overdubbed) vocal parts by Jon on here. On the seventh one, he is heard saying \\"yes.\\" The following track called \\"South Side of The Sky\\" seems to be a standout amongst Yes' many epic-length tracks. There seems to be a bluesy, down-home atmosphere to it, especially in Steve Howe's fluid guitar licks. While it's indeed spacy, it's not as otherworldly as most of their other epics, and seems to maintain a bit of earthiness that some of the other epics didn't.<br /><br />\\"Five Per Cent For Nothing\\" is a short track showcasing Bruford's drumming ability, but, don't expect it to be a virtuoso display, as it seems more like a steady groove-oriented workout. \\"Long Distance Runaround\\" seems to showcase a slight country influence, mostly heard in Steve's guitar. Other than that, the track is a short little ditty. \\"The Fish\\" is Chris Squire's bassline workout, which plays out in something of a 7/4 rhythm, while several overdubbed bass samples are exemplified. Quite a nice track. Catchy and addictive as well. \\"Mood For A Day\\" is Steve's acoustic workout. Quite virtuosic, atmospheric and tasteful. The last track called \\"Heart of The Sunrise\\" starts out with what may have been Yes' most heavy and aggressive moment up until _Relayer_. The crushing attack borders on classic metal. That theme plays out quite a few times within the 3 1/2 minutes of the instrumental opening, which then gives way to a host of trippy atmospherics and Jon Anderson's faraway-sounding vocals.<br /><br />There isn't much more that I can say. This is definitely a classic in Yes' catalog. There isn't another album quite like this one in their catalog. Highly recommended.to be a standout amongst Yes' many epic-length tracks.

0192838679|5.0|This novel was one of the most witty and cynical that I have ever read. De Laclos has a gift for capturing the voices of his depraved characters. His voice was especially strong with the Marquise De Merteuil.  <br /> <br />The basic story-line was a pair of depraved aristocrats plot against a young innocent convent girl and a righteous woman and find that their plot has deadly consequences. It is like nothing I had never read before, since it was completely in letter format. I must admit that I normally use to the typical prose format that most novels are in. But reading the letters was wonderful and it made it feel intimate; as if you were really getting into the minds of the characters. Valmont and Merteil were both so vicious but strangely charming and your heart does go out to Tourvel and Danceny; the only figures in the book that truly do believe in love. <br /> <br />Overall, this book was such a pleasure to read and I highly recommend reading it with dark chocolates around.
B0000075WM|2.0|From [...]<br /><br />It seems as thought EMI wanted to take advantage of the VH1 Program \\"Bands Reunited\\" when it thought to re-issue the two albums by the all-girl \\"Metal\\" band Vixen. The sophomore effort by the band really was nothing all that special, and simply contained more of the same thing that the band featured on their self-titled release. Granted the girls knew how to play, but it was simply just \\"nice rock\\" if you needed a title. This record suffers from sounding a little too much like the manner of music that Heart had been playing for a couple of years so it loses a little based on that. Also when you held them up against the Pat Benatar or Lita Ford's and Joan Jett's, it simply did not cut the mustard.<br /><br />There are a couple of numbers that do stand out such as \\"Love Is A Killer\\" and \\"Hard 16\\", yet nothing that is the hit material of the \\"Edge Of A Broken Heart\\" which broke some ground for these young ladies. While it was a nice blast from the past to hear them again, I really think only their die-hard followers from way back when would look to pick this up. Maybe to replace a worn out vinyl copy of the same piece. New fans from the show might be best served by a hits piece as I know one is around.<br /><br />As mentioned, the band was recently featured on the VH1 show, and they got together for one night and performed. The show really only shows one song and not the rest of any music that is played which is a shame since they should really showcase the whole thing for some of these bands might never do this again. I am thinking some bands from the 80's are better left to the fond memories. Vixen - while a rocking group of girls is probably one of those bands. The music sounds too dated after the years.
B000021YQV|5.0|But I say this in a positive sense.  This is the album that broke System of a Down into mainstream, and they deserve every radio play given thus far.  As always, never does this CD become boring.  'System' seems to produce the type of music that tends to grow onto you more and more as time progresses, no matter how many times you listen to it.  The more you listen, the more you discover how much talent is really behind each track, all of which ending just as explosivly as they begin.  To sum it all up, I recommend this to anyone who has enjoyed what they've heard from System of a Down to this point.  There's much more behind this band than just what you've heard on your local rock station.
B000002JPA|1.0|I am a goth and i cantnot see why anyone wuld want to by this. I mean, this band isntnot on mtv, and only good bands are on mtv. someone said that they were on mtv but that is impossible because they only play bands with good talent like good charlotte. That John Petrucci guy thinks he is so great, but have you seen the newest guitare trick that all the mtv bands r doing? the guitareist jumps up and down while playing the same note, that is so much better than playing 128th notes that lasst for like, .01 seconds. that Avril Lavigne fan who wrote a review further down is a genius. i'm sure that she is at the top of her class at junior college. I heard a dumb theater (i are so funny hahaha) fan once say that u know that Petrucci is better because he can easily play all of avrils songs but she could never play any of his guitare parts and my response to that is...uh....i have to...um...go....and uh...do something
B000002L99|5.0|So, with David Lee Roth out of Van Halen and Sammy Hagar in, which Van Halen proves there still on top of the world. But lets face it Roth was Van Halen period, there's no one that will ever replace him but Hagar was the best choice to fill the vacancy for Van Halen. The whole 5150 album is great and is one of my favorites including 1984 and their debut album. From my interpretation this is what I got out of all the nine songs on 5150.    1. Good Enough- the title says it all with opening guitar riffs by Eddie Van Halen truly proves that Van Halen is back plus the awesome guitar cut at the end. The songs about food I believe how it has to be the best. Rate: 8.5/10    2. Why Can't This Be Love?- total 80's retro songs with a nice beat done by the keyboards ranking this song #3 on the Billboards Hot 100. It's about finding love and why can't it be true something that everyone could relate to. Rate: 9.5/10    3. Get Up- Awesome hard song about fighting for yourself and never quiting, truly a fast- paced song that keeps you moving.  Rate: 9/10    4. Dreams- One of the best songs on this album, I believe it was an even bigger song for graduation. It's about taking your dreams, turning them into reality, and being more than you really are. Fantastic. Rate: 10/10    5. Summer Nights- Nice summer songs thats about summer vacation, having fun, and getting away from the cold, also of coarse we cannot forget our radio too. Rate: 9/10    6. Best of Both Worlds- A very nice upbeat song about having the best and enjoying like no matter what, a really great song that'll keep your foot tapping. Rate: 9.5/10    7. Love Walks In- This one is about aliens which is really wierd in my opinion because the song is all romantic- like and is talking about alien abductions. How is that romantic? Anyway its a nice song with pretty cool guitar solos attached. Rate: 8/10    8. 5150- Great song about running from the law and one person feeling that they can't keep running while the other personfeels that its fun and lets keep doing it. Quite possibly might be about girls too. Anyway, a real kick @$$ awesome song and one of Van Halen's best with a really cool guitar solo and drumming done by Alex. Rate: 10/10    9. Inside- Wierd, but funny with a nice guitar solo inbetween. This song was an absolute joke from start to finish but who cares its not bad and if anyone is going to fool around and put it on a CD, it might as well be Van Halen. Rate: 8/10    So, to sum up 5150 is that its fantastic and proves that Van Halen can and will go on. Plus this is the first Van Halen album to hit number one without any music videos which is amazing. All and all its a 6x platnium album that is worthy of its triumph.
B00005JMUA|5.0|The smart money is to wait until a deluxe edition of the two films is released, BUT there is a terrific extra on this one I doubt will be included in the next and that is the performance footage of CHINGON performing \\"Malaguena Salerosa\\" at the premiere. It is AWESOME. I knew Robert Rodriguez composed music for KB2 but check out his guitar playing chops onstage and be blown away by the vocal work of Alex Ruiz.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|This CD is just great. From the hard rocking songs like \\"Unchained\\", and \\"Sinners Swing\\" to the almost disco sounding \\"So Push Comes To Shove\\" to the upbeat \\"So Is This Love?\\" this cd doesen't dissapoint. Not to mention Dave using the \\"F\\" word in Sinners Swing, adds to the power of the song, and album. Each Early Van Halen CD has its own unique overall sound to it. Every cd is a classic and a fan favorite. A must for all VH fans.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|this is one of the best movies. as a college student, my friends and i often sit around and joke about this hilarious movie. arnold has some classic lines, and i am in complete awe of his body. the most classic parts are when we talks about cuming, and then smokes a joint at the end of the movie. that alone is worth 15 dollars.
B0002OOUP0|1.0|be careful who you buy this CD from - at least some versions come on a CD which has been \\"copy protected\\" in some way that makes it hard or impossible to use on your computer, convert for use on your mp3 player, and may not even work with your ordinary CD player according to some of the web sites I've seen.
0375507256|5.0|To read Cloud Atlas is to re-read it. One reading is not enough, and you will find yourself starting it over at the beginning once you've turned the last page. It is one of the best books I've ever read. Cloud Atlas is unique in scope and depth. It's a profound look at our world today even though the interwoven stories span centuries, from the mid-1800s to the distant future. A challenging read but well worth every moment.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I just got this CD for Christmas. I love it. It has a couple re-mixes which really spice up the album. If you are a Shania Twain or a Country/Pop Fan I definitly recomend this album
B000002ADT|5.0|Of all of  Miles Davis' 120+ releases between his debut release, Kind of Blue remains, to this day, the jazz album of all time. The album's lineup is one of the most astonishing of all. Featuring greats as John Coltrane, Bill Evans and Cannonball Adderley, they all work well together despite their own unique improvisational styles.   <br /> <br />The remasterd release of this landmark album includeds new and original liner notes, session photos, and marvelous sound quality.  When the songs were recorded, they were recorded slightly at the wrong speed, but with the new technology the songs have been restored to their origianal speed. <br /> <br /> <br />
0141301074|4.0|Roald Dahl was anti beards. The Twits originated from an idea jotted down in his notebook. It simply read 'do something against beards'. Thus the character of Mr Twit was born. He had a big, dirty hairy beard that bits of food would stick to. Whenever he was hungry he would stick out his tongue and lap up the morsels of food stuck in the hairs on his face. See Quentin Blake's graphic illustration of this. Truly Mr Twit was a disgusting man.<br /><br />His wife, Mrs Twit was also disgusting, both physically and emotionally. The Twits play all sorts of ghastly tricks on each other involving glass eyes, worms, frogs and other nasty things. The tricks the Twits play on each other are very entertaining. Halfway through the book, Roald Dahl writes 'But that's enough of that. We can't go on forever watching these two disgusting people doing disgusting things to each other'. A shame. I could go on and on reading about their beastly plans they have in store for each other.<br /><br />Justice is done though. The Twits come to, quite literally, a very sticky end courtesy of the Roly-Poly Bird and the Muggle-Wump monkeys. Their scheme to bring down the Twits is ingenious. Read it for yourself to find out...
0679759328|5.0|A slow-moving, low-key narrative of a season in a woman's life packs a surprising punch. I have had this book for years and just never got around to reading it. Why, I do not know. I am very glad I finally read it! <br /> <br />Edith Hope is a quiet, late 30ish writer of romance novels who is spending some time at the Hotel Du Lac in Switzerland. She has been \\"banished\\" there after backing out of her wedding at the time of the ceremony and causing so much embarrassment to her friends, not to mention the expectant groom.  <br /> <br />While at the hotel, she meets a number of women and the descriptions of their lives adds to the aimlessness and seeming futility of her existence. She writes to her secret lover, David, describing them and the life at the hotel and speaks of her love and passion for him. He, needless to say, is married and their relationship is sporadic and quite one-sided. Then, seemingly, rescue comes when a wealthy, successful man staying at the hotel, Philip Neville, proposes to her and offers her a very businesslike, loveless marriage.  <br /> <br />Through these avenues, Edith comes to some profound understanding about not only her life but the lives and needs of women. <br /> <br />There are so many undercurrents in this story and the writing is marvelous, wry, witty and multi-layered.  <br />
0793518326|5.0|This book is one of the most extraordinary contributions to the world of music and musicians in the past decade. The intricacy of some of these recordings is simply fantastic. From the astounding breakdown of \\"Revolution 9\\" (which includes indications of the beginning and end of every throwaway noise sample used) to the perfect transcription of their early pop masterpieces, every song is here with every note represented. <br /> <br />The only drawback --- and it's a small one --- is that the type is rather small. If you're using this to play along to (as I do), I recommend doing so in a well-lit room. Enjoy!!
B0002XDODU|3.0|<br /> <br />Some good songs... but way slower paced than other albums. waaay slower. and boring.  Mein Hertz Brent is a slow song, but rocks... most the songs on this album that are slow, are just plain boring.  Oh well everyone has to make a bad album eventually.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This is, simply put, the best movie ever made.  As a huge fan of zombie movies, when I saw the preview for 'Shaun of the Dead,' I knew I had to see it; it completely lived up to my expectations.  This movie, unlike some other horror parodies, perfectly blends humor with gore.  Also, not only are there plenty of subtle horror movie references for the hardcore horror fan, it's a movie with enough jokes and gore for the average citizen.  As if this killer movie wasn't enough to make me go out and buy the DVD the day it came out, the DVD also includes lots of hilarious bonus features.  Personally, the extended scene of Coldplay promoting Zombaid, a play off of Liveaid, is the funniest thing I've ever seen.  Also, the commentary is not only informative, but unlike most commentary on DVDs, it is interesting to listen to.  To sum this up, anyone who doesn't want to immediately go out and buy this DVD, must have already had their brains eaten by zombies because, again, this is the best movie ever made!
B000058BGZ|5.0|A little perspective: I am a 21-year old pianist who has made it his obligation in the past couple of years to thoroughly internalize Schoenberg's Op. 11 and 19, both of which are found on this CD.  I am a stickler for following every little marking Schoenberg wrote, but I see a lot of room for creativity, too.  My reference recordings have been those of Charles Rosen and Maurizio Pollini, both of which I hold in high esteem for their clean precision and abstract imagery.  For the Berg sonata, I am partial to Maria Yudina's exuberant (and hard to find) recording.  For the Webern variations, Richter's live performance in Vienna is my favorite.  The Concerto is new to me, but I pulled out some recordings from the library to compare it to - Gould, Brendel, Ax, Peter Serkin.    Besides this disc, I have also heard Uchida albums of Schubert, Debussy, Mozart, and Chopin.  I find that her playing tends to be dark-hued, dimly lit and compellingly non-intuitive, with an amazing command of passages calling for gossamer textures.  She can also use impossibly slow tempi at times, coming up with conceptions so expansive that you can stick your head in between the notes.  Both of those qualities make her Schoenberg Op. 19 quite different from the others I've heard, but the concept of space is the more striking and memorable.  Uchida seems to be convinced that it is the silences in these tiny pieces that gives them their meaning, and long ritards to silence mark almost every bar.  Yet the pieces never fall apart, because this is entirely in their character.  It's a free interpretation, to be sure, and not one which is 100% faithful, but it's highly sympathetic and quite effective.    Her Op. 11 is more conventionally beautiful, and it's also easily the best I've heard.  Never mind the fact that Uchida's hands could never actually span the gigantic chords in the third piece - the editing job is seamless and the musical content is what's important.  These readings are far more humane than those of the ferocious Pollini, and the Romantic warmth bleeds through even though the sound is not plush.  The influence of Brahms on Schoenberg can clearly be heard through this truly stellar reading.    The Berg Sonata is merely good.  There are some beautiful moments and there is some real tension here, but Uchida seems to see this as a conventional sonata-allegro movement packing a few extra pounds around the middle, and that's exactly how it comes off.  The Mahlerian drama is muted - I think it takes someone as incandescantly insane as Maria Yudina to really do it justice.  Uchida certainly follows Berg's markings more closely than Yudina does, but they're not well enough internalized and so they don't have the effect that they should have.    The Webern is a welcome addition.  Too many recordings of Webern have an excessive cleanliness to them which makes them alienating and creepy.  This, on the other hand, is warm in the same way that Uchida's Schoenberg Op. 11 is, imbuing this fragmentary, elusive music with a real soul.    The Concerto is the most complex piece on the album, and this performance, by Uchida at the piano with Boulez conducting the Cleveland Orchestra, is the hardest for me to judge.  No doubt that it is fearsomely difficult to play, and she does a fantastic job.  Every page bristles with new and different difficulties, but these are not merely pianistic bells and whistles like you hear in Rachmaninoff or Prokofiev.  The importance Schoenberg puts on each awkwardly placed note makes this piece doubly difficult to execute.  Uchida's overall conception is smooth and highly intelligible, with a fantastic sound.  The only thing it really lacks is style.  The Haydn-esque finale is rather flat compared with any of the other major recordings, such as Gould or Brendel just to name a couple.  Although the form is there, the spark of life is a bit weak.  Nonetheless this is a high-quality recording.    There is much to recommend this CD, and there is more than enough original contribution here to merit a listen by anyone interested in the Second Viennese School.  Go pick it up!
B0000E65V9|4.0|Although not comprehensive, this 3-disc set is a very good introduction to the magic of Springsteen, one of the few timeless and authentic rock legends of the last three decades. Springsteen rarely disappoints musically but I suppose his image of blue-collar champion is a bit tainted after his involvement in partisan politics in 2004.<br /><br />Disc One takes the listener from his promising early excursions like 1973s Blinded By The Light and 4th Of July through 1975s brilliant rock anthem Born To Run and 1978s awesome rocker Badlands, the gloomy ballad Darkness On The Edge Of Town and the defiant Promised Land through to 1980s majestic song The River (I really miss Wreck On The Highway here) and 1982s melancholy and brooding Nebraska.<br /><br />Highlights on Disc Two include the powerful rockers Born In The USA and Glory Days, great hits like Dancing In The Dark, Tunnel Of Love and Brilliant Disguise. For me the most impressive songs here are the introspective numbers like Streets Of Philadelphia and The Ghost Of Tom Joad. Lonesome Day with its country feel, Mary's Place with its horns, and The Rising are beautiful and moving too.<br /><br />On Disc Three, the live tracks include Held Up Without A Gun, a stirring uptempo rocker and Trapped, a grand brooding ballad. None But The Brave is also grand and beautiful, whilst Lift Me Up is a sensitive ballad with Bruce in falsetto mood. His version of Viva Las Vegas proves he's no Elvis but County Fair is one of those sad ballads that he does so well. This disc concludes with Counting On A Miracle, a beautiful acoustic ballad in folk style.<br /><br />The chronological sequence was a good idea as one can follow the development of Springsteen's career through the changing sound, the varying themes and the ever more serious approach. Obviously not compiled for completists who will have all the albums and box sets anyway, The Essential Bruce Springsteen is perfect for those who wish to have the most of his best in one place. It's a winner through and through.one place. It's a winner through and through.  <br />
B000031WI8|5.0|If you like Wham, George Michael and Andrew Ridgely this is the Best of the Best Gold Album.  <br /> <br />My favorite tracks include ... Bad Boys, Wake Me Up Before You Go, Carless Whisper (oh genius), Last Christmas (definitely a must have), others are great also ...
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This brilliantly funny and romance/zombie/comedy is everything an older horror fan could ask for.  Shaun of the Dead, the brainchild of star/co-writer Simon Pegg and director/co-writer Edgar Wright provides loads of laughs while piling on buckets of blood and gore along the way.  Pegg plays Shaun, a late-20's electronics salesman who soon realizes his life is going nowhere.  His girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) has just dumped him, which soon follows his attempt to drown his sorrows at the local pub with his slacker pal Ed (Nick Frost).  All the while, all of Britain is under siege by a fast spreading zombie plague, and soon enough, Shaun and Ed are bashing heads and spilling brains in an effort to save Liz, Shaun's mother and stepfather, and a few other friends while trying to make way to the pub.  Paying homage to the original Dawn of the Dead as well as other films in the genre (\\"we're coming to get you Barbara!\\"), Shaun of the Dead is a joy from beginning to end.  There's plenty of quirky British humor, and plenty of gory zombie horror as well.  It's singlehandedly the best zombie movie to come along in a long time, and while it's horror elements aren't original in the least, it doesn't try to be.  Shaun of the Dead is what Peter Jackson's Dead Alive was over ten years ago: a hilarious and horrifying thrill ride that is an absolute instant classic.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This movie is a brutal portrayal of the force of addiction wreaking havoc in th elives of four people.  As the director says in his liner notes, it is because they choose to live their dreams rather than their lives.  The extra feature interview of Hubert Selby by Ellen Burstyn could be worth the price alone.  This man is wise and very strong!
B00005JLEX|5.0|There is no way you can like the later seasons of seinfeld and not like the first two seasons.I mean this is where it all began, you can see how each character develops from early on. I love all the episodes of seinfeld and friends, and I cant wait until the rest of seinfeld seasons are released.  Definetly not the best quality picture but I think kramer is even funnier in these early seasons than in the later ones.  Go out and get the first 3 seasons soon.
B0000028M7|4.0|Im writing reviews in search of broadening my musical horizons so to speak. its time to ditch the blink and killswitch and move on to the wide world of music. I grew up in Washington so i do love the alternative music. I hope i don't end up in the same category either. <br /> <br />the visual equivalent of listening to this album is watching a toy soldier being melted through a magnifying glass. its ugly and unnatural and distorted. what can i say about this album that has not already been said except that it is all true. if someone says that this music wants to make them puke their guts out then it is true. if they say this music gives them an outer body experience then it is true. in all cases 'dirt' is the definition of poignant. I have never heard a band play with distortion so much. some of the songs it feels like they dont even play chords and they just mess the distortion up until everything sounds jumbled. ofcourse jerry cantrell's solos are very skilled when everything does not sound so muddy. and ofcourse there is staley. Layne's voice is like double vision for the ears at first. They are so mechanical but tormented at the same time. the album itself i believe is seperated into three phases. tracks 1-6, 7-9,10-13. from the beginning the band explodes with \\"Them Bones\\" muddy guitars and violent stabbings of layne. the solos spike up here and there but get back into mudd. cymbal splashes just spice things up. then it leads onto Alice in chains style Americana music that is \\"Dam that river\\". \\"Rain when i die\\" and \\"Down in a Hole\\" stops the attack and goes on defensive not really ballads but depressing and introspective nonetheless. i see pictures of a life living like a machine that just wants to stop. maybe not the best but the most interesting song on the album is \\"sickman\\" it really vividly shows maybe a life drugs. \\"what the hell am i?\\" he asks and all he can think of is why am i here always meaningless to the world, who cares ill die sick anyway. the screams are truly haunting and there is voices all around. just classic.  ofcourse the only ballad on this album is \\"Rooster\\" which bears Layne singing about the blue collar man who fights a war in vietnam and comes back to nothing. the next three might turn off some listeners because they do seem to drag on, the band seems to like only one tempo. but all three deal with three monumental issues. drugs, hating oneself, and religion. the last three tracks are like the first three. \\"Would?\\" being their biggest single and most mysterious of the album. all in all this is the album that makes them the most influential band of the '90s. the chord changes during choruses and voice changes and the style of singing is now driven down to a formula. which really ticks people off. but there is not band that can truly copy this piece of art which is still misunderstood.
B0000C1733|5.0|Right from the sensitive, soulful opening track, 'Under The Bridge' to the raw energy and squealing guitar riffs of 'Suck My Kiss', this is an album that celebrates the illustrious career of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Although it has a definite focus on the second half of the Chili's career, it will not disappoint, be you a fan of the band's funkier songs ('Give It Away') or more inclined towards the quieter ballads ('Californication'). Highlights, for me, include 'My Friends' (the only song on this compilation from the 'One Hot Minute' album), 'Californication', 'By The Way' and 'Universally Faded'. The two new tracks, 'Fortune Faded' and 'Save The Population', are songs that just go to show that the Chilis are definitely not over the best part of their career. In fact, if anything, it's just beginning for them.
0345452577|3.0|This is not your typical Jonathan Kellerman novel, no Alex Delaware, the police harrass instead of help the protaganist, and as I stated earlier, it is not a fast moving, action packed tale which is Kellermans usual style. Nonetheless, I liked it.<br /><br />  The story centers around Dr. Jeremy Carrier, and the unsolved murder of his girl friend Jocelyn Banks. Jeremy is still grieving her death when he is approached by a mysterious pathologist by the name of Arthur Chess, while he is alone, having lunch in the hospital dining room. Although Jeremy has little desire for friendship at this time, Dr. Chess is persistent, and an odd relationship between the two doctors develops. Meanwhile, Angela,  an attractive intern subtly flirts with Jeremy and finally suceeds in obtaining a date with him. Just as Jeremy's life begins to feel \\"normal\\" once again, he accepts an invitation from Arthur Chess to a dinner with some of Arthur's friends. Subsequently,Jeremy's life begins to become very strange. Anonymous mail is delivered to him at his office, his girl friend begins to spend less time with him, and his new-found friend Arthur disappears. As Jeremy attempts to figure out where his friend has gone, and solve the mystery of the anonymous mail deliverys, as well as come to terms with his relationship with Angela, he starts to wonder whom he can trust, and who the enigmatic members of Arthur's little club really are.<br /><br />  I gave this story only three stars because it seemed to drag at times.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|what can i say about this film?...i'm not quite sure.    but i will say this:  after all the hype of this movie...i was not impressed.     i was bored and knew exactly where the story was going all the way through...    although i liked the fact that there was no need for sexual display and they had their own chemistry blend going, nonetheless, it was all in all quite ridiculous.(we all have that in people we come across though -whether it being strangers or not and this was not an extraordinary event of happenings.  ohhhhh, but since coppola wrote it and produced it...but of course it MUST be original (???)--miss coppola, even the 'little people' make these moments happen in a much more exciting and fun way than your little 'lost' movie did. (without sex too).  yawwwwwn.   miss coppola's love letter to japan?   how demeaning for the japanese!    want to rent something grand?  go for 'son of the bride' (in spanish with english subtitles)...now that's a moving story worth tuning into.  you'll feel each character.
0060589272|5.0|This is an absolutely fantastic book.Unfortunately, this book captures the economic realities of a county with few opportunities and a poor educational system-that is Brazil.

B0001GL3K4|2.0|oh boy, this is a doozey of a flick. <br />the only couple i was drawn to was that of the guy who hooks up with the portugese cleaning gal.   sweet. <br />the rest was garbage.
B00025ETIW|5.0|For not knowing who these guys were like a few weeks ago, I completely like fell in love with them since I got this CD. The fact that the majority of the CD is fast paced and has such a raw sound goes far with me. It seems like they just don't hold anything back here. The vocals are unlike anything I've ever heard before in an album and go perfectly with the music in my opinion. One of their songs I believe is on MTV (I'm Not Okay), since it has a playfully almost poppy beat to it. None of the other songs are like that though, which makes the CD keep it's collectively ferocious sound. The lyrics, seem to be kind of meaningful to them and not empty, or at least that's how they come across. One of the songs near the end is sort of similar in the opening to Yellowcard's \\"View From Heaven\\". Some of my more favorite songs are \\"Helena\\", \\"Give em Hell Kid\\", and \\"Thanks For The Venom\\". There's about only one song I skip on this CD, because it just doesn't have that same attack mode as the majority of the other songs do, but that doesn't take away from the fact that this ultimately is a very fast paced album and a breath of fresh air to the music scene. I'm glad I caught on to what I've been missin'!
B00000JS1M|5.0|With out a doubt in my mind the best record Saxon ever released, POWER AND THE GLORY is HeavyMetal Thunder Saxon style! I saw the music video for the title track and i thought it was the best Saxon song i ever heard! I really think that this was the last true Saxon album before they went iffy, i mean CRUSADER was good(for the title track), but it had some questionable parts that would rear it's ugly head on the album after INNOCENCE IS NO EXCUSE.I digress, this is the definative saxon album along with WHEELS OF STEEL, solid classic english metal not heard today.
B00005JMUL|5.0|I LIKE THE MOVIE TOM HANKS DID AWESOME PERFORMENCE GO SEE IT I CAN'T WAIT TO COME ON DVD OR PAY PAPER VIEW
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I got this film for Christmas and watched it after company left. I've since watched it two more times.  I was in a good mood and feeling relaxed .  I thought it was an extremely funny movie with great moments throughout. However when I watched it again I didn't laugh as much.  I guess with this it all depends on the mood you're in.  I could defanitly see myself watching this move more than 20 times in my lifetime.  It was well directed and had a unique story.  I loved it,,, \\"if you think it was dumb you are obviously in a bad mood and you are trying not to laugh.\\"   <br /> <br />Napoleon is so goofy and He talks really cool.My favorite parts were when Uncle Rico was flexing in the resturant. lol,,,   When Napoleon was pushed into the locker,, and I loved the Kip reflexes thing. and the way Napoleon exagerates.  This movie was Perfect, Awsome and Extremely Funny.
B00004U9MS|5.0|This CD is moody.  If you want really uplifting music, this isn't the best album to pick up.  The musical talent displayed in this CD is amazing.  They have great guitarists, an amazing drummer, especially on the track Trouble, and great vocals and piano, both done by Martin.  Great CD.
B00005JM0B|4.0|To start off, this is a high octane supercharged action thriller. It has all the bells and the whistles. But, when it comes to the storyline, that's where it fails. T3 suffers from what I would call a lack of storyline or \\"substance\\" what the previous 2 Terminator movies have. This movie also lack the human emotion and/or journey that made Terminator 2:Judgment Day a flagship movie, even till this day. Don't get me wrong, Jonathan Mostow did a great job with this movie but the thing is, he played it safe by not explaining too much on the abovementioned. On the bright side, this movie gives us something that the previous 2 movies didn't: a face off with a female terminator(that ought to keep the temperature up a little). The trailer sequence was impressive. And when the story ends, there are possibilities for a fourth sequel cause this movie has not done a good job of \\"closing\\" the story for good. One more thing, the running time is a little too short for a Terminator movie, compared to T2, which is 2 hours over. To wrap this up, this movie is great for viewing on a lazy Saturday afternoon. For the Terminator purists out there, you might be a little disappointed for this movie is not to be taken seriously, in the whole Terminator trilogy.
B0001AP12G|4.0|This album was good, but it could have been amazing.  The beats are hot, and so are MOST of the lyrics.  The tracks that took away from an almost flawless album were The New Workout Plan, and Breathe in Breahte Out.  I thought The New Workout Plan was funny at first, but after a while, its just annoying.  Breathe in Breathe out messed up the nice storytelling, and conciousness.  He better apologize to Mos and Kweli.  Now Mos Def's CD The New Danger is sooo good.  Check that out.  This CD is still good.  You should pick it up.  The track Slow Jamz isn't exactly the same as the single.  It's better.
B00004RF8J|5.0|Little Shop of Horrors is one of my all time favorite movies.  It's one of those oddball flicks that just kind of sticks with you, year after year.  The music is great, the story is hilarious, and the casting is perfect (I'm not a real big Rick Moranis fan, but I can't imagine anyone else playing the part of Seymour Krelborn).  There are some great cameos, including Christopher Guest as one of the customers in the flower shop.
B00005T5YK|5.0|If you were around in the late 70's and were within earshot of rock and pop radio, you heard the Eagles' 'Hotel California' and if you've listened to classic rock radio since then and till today, you are familiar with this album many times over, possibly even sick of it (as you might be with Fleetwood Mac's 'Rumours', Pink Floyd's 'The Dark Side of the Moon' and most of Led Zeppelin), as you might be sick of Eagles music in general.  However, just this Christmas day, I was with family, and the household happened to have a superb DVD/Dolby surround setup and the man of the house received the DVD-A of 'Hotel California' as a gift.  He put it on, and I was there to experience this already time-honored album in glorious multi-channel surround sound.  If you thought you've heard enough of the Eagles' best album, you ought to give this a chance -- the classic title track alone makes it worth the purchase.  You will hear cymbal swells, guitar parts separated and panned, vocals and all that is the musical brilliance of this album as you never have before.  \\"Wasted Time\\" sounds so good it will make you weep (this was always one of my favorite Eagles album tracks, as is \\"The Last Resort\\", also benefitting from the DVD-A treatment) ... highly recommended for Eagles, classic rock, and music fans in general needing to hear how good either the DVD-A or SACD format can be.
B0001AVZA8|3.0|I got hold of this movie by chance and kept on my shelf for about 2-3 months when I finally decided to watch it for the sake of  habit. I was in it for the simple fact that Nicholson was the main actor and having seen other of his movies, I can say he's a great actor and a funny guy. Diane Keaton (plays the role of Erica Barry), on the other hand, is a stiff playwright, hasn't had male company in some time now, but in the end falls in love with Nicholson's character, Harry Sanborn, a successful businessman and playboy, despite Julian Mercer's (Keanu Reeves) desperate efforts to win over Erica (!?). Having seen this movie, I definitely think it's not meant for the younger audience, but mostly for middle-aged women. The film has a few funny quotes but it's nothing special. As I said, Nicholson is the star of this movie.
B00006879E|5.0|it took me a long time to like them.... i did buy the cd when they had the song 'harder to breathe' as the single but i did not really listen to the album until 'this love' was getting annoying and 'she will be loved' was jammin'.. <br /> <br />'she will be loved' is just a overall beautiful song... the way adam sings is just so passionate.... he reminds me of freddie mercury of queen.... i just love the way he sings.... <br /> <br />i love 'sunday morning'..... 'this love' was great until they played it over and over and ove again..... it gets annoy after the millionth time they play it in ONE DAY!!!!! <br /> <br />but a great debut album one of the best in the late 2003 through 2004.... buy it NOW
B00003CXCT|3.0|I love the Star Wars trilogy, but I won't be buying this set given Lucas' decision to release only the miserably botched \\"special edition\\" versions on DVD - on grounds of \\"artistic integrity\\", no less. This from the creator of Jar Jar Binks! His recent claims that \\"these are the movies I really wanted to make\\" and \\"the originals were only about 25-30% of what I wanted them to be\\" wouldn't ring so hollow if the special editions were 70-75% better. But tell me, does planting a ludicrously unrealistic digital Jabba into Docking Bay 94, or fiddling with the colour of the sky on Bespin, or re-scoring the Ewok finale add 75% more quality or enjoyment to these films? Apparently George thinks it does, which actually goes a long way towards explaining why the CGI-heavy prequels are so appallingly inane. The truth behind the Special Editions, I suspect, is more commercial: in 1997 they were a marvelous opportunity for Lucasfilm to capture a new generation of child consumers, and promote the prequels by whetting our appetite for the potentials of CGI, not to mention collecting a couple of hundred million for their trouble. Now, once again, alternate versions are being used to empty the pockets of \\"completists\\" who have to own everything in the Star Wars product range. Even if you buy George's argument, surely DVD compression technology is on the brink of being able to offer a kind of dynamic editing whereby you can choose to watch a movie with the \\"special\\" sequences OR the original sequences, all on a single disc? Why not wait until, say, 2006 when we can do this, and release a ten-disc set with Episodes I-VI plus bonus materials? Why not give the fans the chance to enjoy the movies they grew up with, rather than the politically-correct (Greedo shot first, yeah right), digitally enhanced embarrassments forced on them twenty years later? It obviously isn't enough for Lucas that he's ruined our dreams for Episodes I, II - and presumably III - with abysmal writing, ham acting, and a CGI obsession bordering on clinical insanity. He's had to go back and put his ruinous stamp on Episodes IV, V and VI as well. Of course, this might not always be the case. Never one to shy away from an opportunity to cash in on the greatest cinema franchise in history, you can bet your lightsaber Lucas will eventually release the original editions on DVD - just as soon as 99% of the fans have wasted their money on this set.

0062502182|5.0|The fable revolves around the life of a young boy named Santiago. It deals with the incidents that happen to him and the lessons that he learns on his way to achieve his goal. <br /> The whole story is set in a world which is much like our world in its outlook but very different in its attitude and expression. There are many characters like the old man, the Arab, the Englishman, the lover girl Fatima and so on. All the characters are well handled and leave their significance in the readers mind. <br /> The characters themselves and the words they utter make one feel that we indeed live in a world full of miracles. It is not a love story but has the element of love in right proportions.  <br /> A simple pragmatist may dismiss the novel as a ordinary fairy tale ,but a meticulous one, will find spiritual and philosophical connotations in it. On the whole, it emphasizes that one gets what one has to get and that one should hold on to his/her dreams. It is a book worth reading and a must-have in a reader's library. <br />
B00008H2LB|5.0|linkin park is one of my favourite band of all time... they can sure rock a house when they perform.... this cd METEORA is just brilliant but they do need t get us something new.....i think this is the millineum rock version of michael jackson's THRILLER... they are just riding off the songs on the cd and releasing them... no lie each song on this album is a potenital number one hit.... <br /> <br />my favourite song is 'faint' i love the beat to the song and i was the only one on earth that thinks britney took the elements from this song to make 'toxic'.... <br /> <br />'somewhere i belong', 'breakin the habit', 'numb' are great singles..... LP has came a long way..... <br /> <br /> <br />i just wish they would kind of hurry withnew music because we could only listen to the same for awhile....
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I listened to this album and it completely consumed me. It pulled me in, chewed me up and then spit me out, and I absolutely loved it. It's there best yet. THIS IS NOT RADIOHEAD REHASHED. Of course there are similarities to draw upon, but Muse is definitely on a level that is removed from anyone else.  It is like they were making this album as if the the hope of the world hinged upon it. The music is a fusion of hope and despair. Beautiful!
1400032717|5.0|\\"Curious Incident...\\" could be the most original book I've read in a long while.  The narrative is incredibly fresh and I couldn't have loved the main character more and it's mainly because of this that keeps you as the reader doing what you are supposed to be doing...reading.      The book is a lesson in empathy and a great one to say the least.  \\"Curious Incident...\\" is kind of a \\"slice-of-life/day-in-the-life\\" type of book.  Haddon has an extremely observant eye that translates well on paper.  He's obviously done he's research regarding the psyche of Christopher.  Being somewhat O.C.D myself, he couldn't have gotten it more right from the 4 Red cars in a row to the excessive counting, to the mapping out everything, it's all very true.      You can't always guess what's going to happen next because you're in the mind of this O.C.D-autistic like personality which was such an engaging and insightful perspective to read from.  And it's also takes you on a somewhat emotional ride.  I found it somewhat sad when YOU (as the reader) understand what's going on, but it's still confusing to Christopher and you sympathesize for him.  This is a real achievement for the writer.  The book has it's share of (I wouldn't say twists really), plot curves is probably more deserving and they are good ones and make the \\"mystery\\" that much better.  But I found the book to be at it's best when it's just Christopher in a room thinking.  To me, this was more riveting and interesting.  And the ending.  Great ending.  It doesn't cop out and go for the \\"hollywood\\" type of ending.  It's not sappy or contrived, it's realistic.    All in all, great book to read when you are in ANY mood.  I don't want to overhype it or anything, but clever, insightful, smart, and original are just a few words to describe this book.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|In the beginning of this movie we find our star Van Helsing fighting evil. Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman)has no memory, yet he knows he has a destiny that will answer all his questions. We find him working for the Vatican; the man they use to destroy evil throughout the world. Not a job that is easy, but one he seems equipted for.  I loved the begininning when he faces,Mr. Hyde and wins.That was a great 'catcher' of your attention right from the start.<br /><br />Now, he must fight Dracula,who has been helping Dr. Frankenstein create life, but Dracula had his own reasons for being so 'kind,' and they are quite chilling.<br /><br />  Van Helsing also has to save the souls of a family that has been fighting Dracula for centuries. We meet Anna, she is a lovely women and now the last of that family to be alive, she must win the battle against Dracula so her family may find eternal peace and Van Helsing is directed to help her. My favorite character is Carl, a Friar who travels with Van Helsing and  comes up with all the needed equiptment Van Helsing uses to conquer evil. His humor brings a freshness to this movie that is almost like the icing on a cake. Nice touch!<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie, it was quite entertaining and moved along quickly.  The acting was great and the special effects were very good.  Recommended.

B0006419J6|5.0|I knew that any movie with Will Smith in it had to be a winner, and I was not disappointed. Set in the future, robots have been given many jobs and are being used to help humans.<br /><br />Will Smith, who plays Detective Spooner, dislikes robots for personal reasons and is not surprised when trouble erupts between humans and robots, after the death of their creator.<br /><br />The movie becomes quite intense as he finds out the robots are planning to take over mankind, for their own good of course!<br /><br />This is a great movie full of suspense and adventure and a really good storyline that holds your interest through the entire movie.  I recommend this one for the entire family.
B0002SROT0|4.0|The sleeve notes tell the story everyone already knows, so quietly that you'd hardly notice it: \\"Final production by Elliott's family and friends./ Thank you.\\" And knowing that story ourselves, we're listening out for it in the music. It's not hard to find. In fact, it's almost pushed too hard in the haunted-house feedback and schizophrenically babbling fadeout on the first track, \\"Coast to Coast\\", the crunchy distortion of \\"Don't Go Down\\", the lyrics of \\"Fond Farewell\\": \\"This is not my life/it's just a fond farewell to a friend\\". It comes mainly from the production, and once the first shock is over we can't help feeling that Elliot's family and friends have pushed the sound a bit too much in the direction of the obvious and exploitative. <br /> <br />On further listening, though, the original strengths of the music begin to assert themselves. The album relies on its production more than any of his others, and some of the melodies are a bit perfunctory, but in other places -- such as \\"Pretty (Ugly Before)\\" -- his gift for writing songs that are simultaneously delicate and anthemic comes through as strongly as ever. \\"Fond Farewell\\" will be best remembered for the lyric quoted above, but listen to the way it falls over itself to start the verse at the absolute earliest possible point, moves on to the chorus a line too early, and then abruptly allows the singing to break off a line before the chorus would ordinarily end, as if he's trying to pack absolutely as much as possible into a shorter time than he would otherwise have. On \\"Don't Go Down\\", which sustains its lyrical inventiveness better than any other song on the album, the striking thing turns out not to be the distorted production but the contrast between it and the amused-yet-caring observational tone of the singing voice. <br /> <br />It's maybe not the strongest Elliott Smith album to start with, but it has depths, richness, and a personality all of its own. One to treasure.
B0000X61UU|5.0|As is normally the case for new aerobic workouts, you have to give yourself time to master all of the moves, but this workout is very rewarding and motivating.   <br /> <br />Cindy Crawford has made a too-tall body that would normally considered freakish into a work of art. Normally, \\"super stars\\" are major geeks in high school and its brutal sorting of personalities but then they learn to value themselves. <br /> <br />Britney Spears failed to do so and the result is that terrifying emptiness we see in her eyes in Mike Moore's Fahrenheit 911, where she says we must obey the President in a dazed fashion, but generally speaking, \\"stars\\" who actually participate in the creation of these workout tapes have to contribute a modicum of real presence...as did the pioneer of these workouts, Jane Fonda. <br /> <br />Of course, many people merely want the appearance and not the reality; there is something nasty about Britney's body which Cindy's doesn't share, because the former's regimen probably includes drugs to both keep pounds off, and numb her to the reality of her situation as a commodity. <br /> <br />It might be thought that an aerobics tape of what Foucault called *technique de soi* is indeed a thin rail to support such ponderous (and lecherous) speculation. But meaning is in the differences, and the difference inherent in aerobics tape is that they, like cigarettes, are audience participatory.
068483605X|5.0|When I went off for my first semester of college my father gave me $100 with which to buy textbooks, which certainly dates me.  After buying everything for my classes I had enough money left over to buy a hard cover copy of \\"Watership Down\\" by Richard Adams for $6.95, which for people who love books is certainly a great way of representing the ravages of inflation over the years.  I decided to read a chapter of \\"Watership Down\\" each night before going to bed, thereby marking the beginning of my obsession with reading a chapter of something each day that has nothing to do with school.  When my dorm roommate became as hooked on the story as much as I was he and I would read chapters aloud.  Fifty days I got to the book's epilogue with the same sort of sadness that it was all over that I experienced getting to the end of the \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy.<br /><br />Living in the Sandleford Warren with its Chief Rabbit and Owsla maintaining a comfortable social order, Hazel and his little brother Fiver are content enough.  But Fiver has the gift of prophecy, and when he warns that the warren has to be abandoned right away or they are all going to die, Hazel and a small circle of friends believe him and leave despite the fact that have no idea where they are going.  Fiver envisions a great high place where they can be happy and safe, but there are a series of imposing obstacles to overcome, from not only humans and predators, but other wild rabbits as well.  Consequently the basic story of \\"Watership Down\\" is the ancient quest for home, although in this case it is a new home that represents a wild rabbit's idea of utopia.<br /><br />The greatness of \\"Watership Down\\" rests on the sense of realism that Adams brings to his story wild rabbits.  Adams studied Lapine life in R. M. Lockley's \\"The Private Life of the Rabbit\\" in order to keep his rabbits real.  But beyond the way rabbits live in nature Adams provides them with a history and a culture, represented not only in the stories they tell of El-ahrairah (the Prince with a Thousand Enemies), but their beliefs in Frith the lord sun, and their simple games such as bob-stones.  When confronted with sticky situations they are able to use their ingenuity to come up with surprising solutions that are still within the realm of possibility for real rabbits.  I always liked the way Hazel, Blackberry and the others have to work out these puzzles, straining for a leap of intuition and cognitive insight that seems just beyond the reach of their relatively simple minds.  So while these rabbits are capable of doing more than others of their kind, Adams keeps their efforts remarkable rather than magical.<br /><br />We also pick up a few choice words from the language of the rabbits (e.g., \\"silflay\\" is to go above ground to feed, \\"homba is a fox), which ends up paying off with one of my favorite moments in the book when Bigway utters a simple but effective curse.  The lesson of the story is clearly that bigger does not mean better, for Hazel is neither the strongest nor the smartest of the rabbits that he leads, but he had the best qualities of leadership.  Each of the rabbits that join Hazel on the quest to find Watership Down and build a new life there offers something to the ground, and the distinctive personalities that Adams creates for each of them adds to the novel as well.<br /><br />Of all the books that I have that I like to pick up from time to time and read again my favorite parts, \\"Watership Down\\" is the oldest.  As a children's story is it simply one that is too good for most children, but without the deep allegorical elements that afflict so many other great children's stories.  Perhaps that is why this novel has become so beloved, because it speaks to the child in all of us and the simple virtues that we all want the world to embody.  Having read the book again from start to finish, I was not surprised to find that it is still as good as I thought it was when I first read it manyyears ago.d it many years ago.
B0000AI45P|5.0|I really wouldn't classify Television as a punk band. They are too precise, too tight, and too jazzy to be a punk band (even though they were part of the CBGB scene in New York around 1977, which included some other artists worthy of mention like the Ramones, and the Talking Heads). I would classify them more in the vein of Pink Floyd's soaring progressive rock or The Velvet Underground's free-form improvisational rock. But that's beside the point. The point is that this album (Marquee Moon, 1977, Elektra) is a masterpiece of guitar rock, bar none.    I would go so far as to consider Tom Verlaine (vocals, lead guitar) and Richard Lloyd (guitar) to be the greatest guitar duo ever. Listen to their solo-swapping duties on the title track and see what I mean! I would also give credit to the funky bass playing of Fred Smith (who I rank 3rd greatest bassist of all time, just below John Entwistle of The Who, and John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin), and the tight, reverb-free drumming style of Billy Ficca, who has more than a few impressive moments on the album.    Also, unlike punk music, most, if not all, of the guitars played on this album are clean. No distortion, just clean as a bell. I can't imagine how this album would sound if it was played any different.    All of the songs on the album have all become classics in thier own right, and this album can lay claim to having absolutely no weak tracks. See No Evil (a upbeat rocker, and a great way to open the album), Friction (which has the funkiest guitar line I have ever heard, and a tremendous job by Fred Smith), the title track (an improvisational guitar masterpiece, and the best of the best) and Prove It (another upbeat song, with some more fantastic guitar playing, and the drums are also worthy of mention) are probably the best songs on the album, but that doesn't mean that Venus or Elevation, or even Torn Curtain aren't worthy of praise.    This is a remastered version of the original album, and since I have heard theoriginal, I can safely say that the sound is overall a little brighter and clean-sounding than the original CD issue. There are also new bonus tracks, but they are more of a  nuisance than a blessing (with the exception of Little Johnny Jewel [Parts 1 & 2] which many fans have been dying to have on CD).    Overall, this is a masterpiece of art-punk/improvisational rock and should be part of any serious music collection.    If you like this album, try Television's next album Adventure (which is as good a follow up to Marquee Moon should sound, despite some minor flaws), or seek out more bands from the CBGB scene. The Velvet Underground is also a good bet.
B00005KFUM|5.0|While British rock band Muse are big in the UK, the US is only just starting to get acquainted with these original, entrancing musicians. And their second album, \\"Origin of Symmetry,\\" they accomplish the almost impossible -- every song is epic and thrilling.<br /><br />The first two songs open with delicate rippling piano intros that suddenly blossom into rock riffs. Feedback kicks off into sizzling basslines and riffs in \\"Plug In Baby\\" and \\"Citizen Erased,\\" while wind chimes and an acoustic melody are at the heart of \\"Screenager.\\" \\"Hyper Music\\" is the only dud. It's a discordant clatter that becomes a discordant rock song -- nuff zed.<br /><br />But as good as most of the album is, Muse save the best for absolute last. The penultimate song \\"Feeling Good\\" is perhaps the best -- fuzzy chopsticks start the song, followed by a stretch of epic rock and soaring vocals. The finale is no less entrancing, a slowly stately wave of sound that slowly transitions into an equally rich rock song.<br /><br />Americans really got to know Muse through their latest album, \\"Absolution.\\" But it's not the only album they have done, nor is it the best. \\"Origin of Symmetry\\" may well take that honor, or at least tie with their debut \\"Showbiz.\\" Relatively few people know about these earlier albums, or about the rich apocalyptic quality of Muse at their best.<br /><br />Muse is definitely a band for Radiohead fans -- it has the same rich spaciness and art-rock quality, but it's more grounded and gritty. The most entrancing instrumentation is done on piano -- it can be delicate, dark, fuzzy, or outright epic. The piano is accompanied by smashing percussion, sinuous riffs and basslines, and sweeps of spellbinding electronics.<br /><br />Matt Bellamy puts his good vocals to use in every song, and he's as versatile as his piano. Much of the time he opts for the smooth, low sound. But he also gets to howl, and occasionally sounds like he's been huffing helium. And the songwriting is also pretty solid, often focusing on betrayal and a lover who \\"was so beautiful.\\"<br /><br />Muse deftly dodged the sophomore slump in \\"Origin of Symmetry,\\" a soaring rock epic that won't be fast forgotten.so pretty solid, often focusing on betrayal and a lover who \\"was so beautiful.\\"  <br /> <br />Muse deftly dodged the sophomore slump in \\"Origin of Symmetry,\\" a soaring rock epic that won't be fast forgotten.
0553712837|1.0|My family has a great, dry, sarcastic sense of humor, but we found this CD to be incredibly boring and a waste of 4 hours. We didn't care about the characters, understand where Grisham was going with the story, or feel at all satisfied by the ending. A basic problem is this: Why would the neighbors care if you decided to skip Christmas? Mine wouldn't. And why would a couple not be able to explain to their grown daughter their change of holiday plans? We will go back to true classics, such as A Christmas Story and A Christmas Carol. No wonder the film adaptation of this clunker tanked at the box office.
0060930349|4.0|I get a kick out of all this 'objectivity' nonsense when people talk about history.  I have yet to read anything, much less a history book that does not have a bias in it.  All writings are written by people and since all people have preconceived notions and ideas about everything, it will show through in the writing.  Johnson is a conservative and clearly favors democracy and free trade and is clearly anti-socialism and government interference (he seems thoroughly familiar with economics and the tragedies wrought on humanity by those who are not).  Throughout this book, he presents a powerful arguement to back these ideas.  However, his stance on Nixon is unacceptable.  The idea that was Nixon did in Watergate was okay because other politicians have done it, or still do it, is no excuse for the abuses of power Nixon was responsible for.    Johnson, also, finds historical people much more fascinating than historical events and ideas.  With an elegant style, he brings to life personalities that have been dead for centuries and is able to shed light on how they influenced events.  Also, he talks about how people were and not just about the ideologies they put forth.  This provides for a remarkable look at some of America's most influential mothers and fathers.  Johnson discusses what he sees as flaws in a person's character and balances this with what he sees as virtues, leaving no doubt as to whether or not he views a person as fundamentally virtuous or flawed.      In addition to this human view of history, he takes the time to discuss cultural history in addition to political and economic history.  He mentioned many works of art and literature, as well as artists and writers, providing me with a nice reference of American art and literature.     Like many of his other books, his writing style is superb.  And he provides a very human touch to history.      I highly recommend this book.
B000002UAI|5.0|...and one that rocks alright -- especially considering the tight schedule the group kept from June through November 1964, and how the songwriting efforts here followed so closely after the massive creative output of \\"A Hard Day's Night,\\" just six months before.  An interesting thing to do is to find the footage of their Paris concert in early 1965.  \\"Beatles for Sale\\" was topping the charts around the world at the time.  In that concert, one of their best ever filmed, the group plays several of the important songs from this album.  The Parisians rock along with them, not simply screaming and ignoring the music, as other audiences tended to do.  The French kids certainly understood what the Beatles were trying to do with this album!  \\"Beatles for Sale\\" only suffers in anticipation of greater work to come in later years.  And (of course), true fans will need to find an old, good condition, STEREO British album to hear it as it was released.  What on earth can EMI be thinking, putting the first four out in MONO?
B00005614M|5.0|This is one those records that on hearing the first time, one might wonder \\"What is going on here?\\" Even now, it has a unique , fresh sound, with some very interesting harmonics and solos, not to mention rhythms that don't swing, but may be like a mellow bop. You can tell all the players are right on target thruout. It may seem a bit dissonent on first hearing, but no doubt this CD deserves its reputation as innovative and timeless.Some very nice listening once you've gotten the feel for it!
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|That is my reaction when I heard this album for the first time. This was a amazing CD! Franz has a unique style like no one else. They just are just great indie rock. Franz's goal was to create music that people could dance to. Every single song on here is worth dancing to.  <br /> <br />The lyrics here are truley amazing. They are so catching that you will be singing the same line over and over agian.  <br /> <br />The best song on this CD is The Dark of the Matinee. It is a haunting song that will have you tapping your feet and begging for more. These songs are nothing that you have heard before. Noting has ever sounded as cool as what Franz Ferdinand provides. These catchy pop melodys will change your day. Go pick this up.
B00000IN5G|5.0|Children of Bodom has to become a legend and a household name for all music lovers. Alexi has this \\"skills to pay the bills\\" on this album and all other Bodom Albums. CoB's musicians ship is incredible! <br /> <br />Warheart 9/10 <br />Insane bass intro, crazy guitar work, awsome song! <br /> <br />Silent Night Bodom Night 8/9 <br />Very Cool Song, heavy, and fast! <br /> <br />Hatebreeder 10/10 <br />Probably the best song on the album with a very imperesive guitar/keyboard solo! <br /> <br />Bed of Razors 9/10 <br />Also a favorite on this album! Love the intro! <br /> <br />Torwards Dead End 10/10 <br />Also a great song! What can I say, IT ROCKS!!! <br /> <br />Black Widow 8/10 <br />A good song. The beggining lacks quality work like other Bodom songs. This is a strait out raw as hell song, takes no prisioners and could kick Canible Coarpse's gay A** any day! <br /> <br />Wrath Within 8/10 <br />If you just get past the beggining you'll really like this song. I'd give it lower but it has a sick Alexi solo and some cool riffage. And its pretty short, at least its not a long crapy song (like all Cradle of Filth songs). <br /> <br />Children Of Bodom 10/10 <br />Another favorite on this album! Pure CoB and loving every second of it!!! <br /> <br />Downfall 9/10  <br />Great closer! Makes me want to start all over again!!! <br /> <br />This band is great.  It has the raw vocals of all Death Metal, the riffs are thrashy, the solos are pure Rock 'n Roll. All these ingredients make for an experiance that blows me away!!! <br /> <br />WOW!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002MP2|5.0|This CD was Green Day's first major record. Boy was it a hit. It was a best seller not only in the United States, but also internationally. This is just a fun punk rock album that with a unique sound of thier own had just absolute success. Thus, Green Day's careers took off.  <br /> <br />There are so many hits that everyone knows such as Longview, Welcome to Paridise, Basket Case, When I Come Around and She. This CD brought a whole new era of music. Now bands such as Blink-182, and Sum 41 exist. They don't even compete with the greatness of Green Day but because of Green Day they are playing the music that they play. <br /> <br />The lyrics talk to everyone here. They talk about everyday life problems, and instead of saying everything is ok, it tells you how it really is. Which I liked. This is a classic of the 90's. Nothing sounded anything like this. Green day revoluntionized music for us. Which we all should thank them for. Great record. A classic for us all.
B00004SCX6|4.0|Let's face it. Without music like that of Miss Spears, other \\"serious\\" outfits would nary sound half as good as they do. Don't tell me that you can resist boucing along to \\"One Kiss from You\\" or singing along with the soul-searching, hearfelt lyrics in \\"Lucky\\". <br /> For quick-buck pop-dreck, this is awfully catchy. Save your caustic criticisms for more worhty opponents and give in to sweet musical temptation.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|I started to listening to Avenged sevenfold back at te begging of 2003 and have loved them ever since... this album is just so good. Brilliant melodic songs with a mix between screaming and a more clean voice. Avenged sevenfold remind me of a mixture between Give up the ghost, Misfits and metalica.  <br />And yes! Avenged Sevenfold are hardcore punk/ metal core. <br />Love it!
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|I hate to give an album fewer stars just because it makes me feel rotten, but \\"Thirteenth Step\\" also bores me. It's repetitive and more than a little pretentious. The addiction concept becomes tiresome near the end. Download \\"Weak and Powerless\\", \\"The Outsider\\" and \\"Pet\\" and save your hard earned bread.  <br />Liked the cover art and music vids though. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005J6T1|5.0|This album came out in August of 1983 and no one knew about it. But it took a January 1984 performance of Dick Clark's American Bandstand doing Holiday and some videos on MTV for people to catch up with Madonna!  This is such a fun dance album with lots of rhythms and enough to keep you entertained for eight songs.  That single radio version of Holiday is no contest to the six minutes of the album version.  Same with the five minutes of Borderline.  Physical Attraction I still love--it sounds so good in South Carolina as well as the other album's songs! And Everybody, a club hit before this album came out, sounds very dynamic for this album. Even I Know It sounds good on here. Madonna was ready for world denomination, and this album went on to sell over 3 million and stay on the album chart for almost 3 years or so! Excellent on all counts!
B00005JN2Z|5.0|\\"Collateral\\" is one of the best films of 2004, a visually sumptuous masterpiece that may eclipse \\"Heat\\" as the definitive modern Los Angeles crime picture. Michael Mann directed both, and, using digital technology here, photographs the city so initimately LA seems almost foreign: Gone is the balmy, commercial gleam of Beemers and cell phones; in its wake, a spare, working metropolis pocked with desert wilderness. It recalls the Raymond Chandler days: Men live and work here. The white noise has been dialed all the way down. The plot to \\"Collateral,\\" from Stuart Beattie's screenplay, is mere potboiler, but Mann's style so informs the story that it acheives a kind of elegance, a fuzzy sheen not unlike the halos surrounding the street lights in the movie.  <br />  <br />The same can be said of the comfortable subtle performances from two noted extroverts, Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Cruise is Vincent, nihilist first, hitman second, more brutally than silently efficient, who hires cab driver Max (Foxx) to usher him around to six targets throughout the city. The first hit is a failure: Vincent's target falls out the window and onto Max's cab.  <br />  <br />\\"Plan B,\\" Vincent says.  <br />  <br />A conflict emerges: The Foxx character is smart, angry and moral enough to size up his captor's plan - Max might as well be on the ferry going across the river. It becomes a question of impulse, and the cautious, plodding Max is not initially up to it until Vincent rigs a daunting, if unlikely, scenario inside a night club. Other preordained complications - foreseen, frankly, as these movies exist to have curveballs - emerge; Vincent is fond of jazz, and likens the rest of the evening to improvisation, \\"between the notes.\\"  <br />  <br />Visually the movie is precisely imperfectly so, as Mann mixes his patented jam-in-your-face close-up with overhead shots, staged medium compositions, documentary snippets, as when a coyote gallops across the street in the dead of night. The epic cool of \\"Heat\\" is gone, replaced by blue-collar sweat and that dense grain of Mann's \\"Ali\\" - it seemed cinematically ambivalent at the time, but it's making more sense now.  <br />  <br />The look of \\"Collateral\\" is disturbing and beautiful, distancing and timeless. The apex comes when Cruise is framed by a subway window, outside which the sun has begun to rise, the curved palms beginning to get distinguish themselves against the sky. It is a Mann Moment, one that escaped him in \\"Ali,\\" and was simply too contrived and arch in \\"Heat\\" when Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro clutched hands.  Here it is exotic and lush, both contained within the car and infinite out the window, with a view stretching for miles toward the desert or ocean. It is a shot the city, and cinema, deserves.  <br />
B00005JMUL|5.0|This has been the most moving holiday movie that we have seen in a long time.  Even as adults, we decided to see this film a second time on Christmas Eve and I foresee this being a tradition for many more Christmas Eves, but likely on DVD, or so I hope.  In my opinion, anyone who thinks the story line is weak or thin, doesn't \\"believe.\\"
6305513406|4.0|\\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\" was actually the second pilot episode and the first featuring Captain Kirk (William Shatner).  In it, a mysterious energy barrier at the edge of the galaxy transforms two crewmembers (Gary Lockwood and Sally Kellerman) into dangerous beings with god-like powers.  Here we see series creator Gene Roddenberry's fascination (obsession?) with omnipotent beings that caused Harlan Ellison to lament that Roddenberry had only one idea-that God is mad.   <br /> <br />In \\"The Corbomite Maneuver,\\" the Enterprise resorts to a bluff in order to escape destruction by a more powerful alien craft.  More TOS regulars, such as McCoy (DeForest Kelly), Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), and Sulu (George Takei), make their first appearances.  There is some good interaction between the crewmembers regarding the enormous pressures that accompany space exploration. <br /> <br />A couple of good, solid Trek episodes. <br />
630170648X|5.0|A witty and entertaining comedy that sophisticatedly satirizes Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party. Filmed early during World War II, the movie was probably several generations before its time. It was bold enough to focus on and belittle the Nazi Party when they possessed considerable power and their ultimate role in history was as of yet undefined.  Fascism is attacked throughout by exaggerating its flawed logic into comedic situations. Great cast including Jack Benny, Carole Lomard, Robert Stack, Lionel Atwill and Tom Dugan among others. Jack Benny's facial expressions alone are worth watching this great film.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I've been listening to Green Day since I was a little kid (my dad is a fan and he'd play their stuff in the car), and this is my favorite album by them. It shows how much they've grown since \\"1,039 Smoothed Out Slappy Hours\\". You have to listen to the whole cd in one sitting to fully understand it because the cd tells the story of characters such as the Jesus of suburbia, Whatsername, and St. Jimmy. Each song stands out on its own, no song sounds the same. The one that stands out the most is probably \\"Extraordinary Girl\\" because it has a very indian feel to it. \\"St. Jimmy\\" has a very punk feel to it, and I like how it goes from that song straight into \\"Give Me Novacaine\\" which more of a poppy song. This cd is very political (anti-Bush), so if you're not into that I wouldn't suggest buying it. But this is a cd that no Green Day fan should be without.
B00000JCOV|1.0|Since when is rap-rock called metal. I just downloaded this album to see what's so \\"cool\\" about slipknot and just found a superficial , comercial , boring piece of \\"material\\" (material!?...yeah,right! more like garbage).I am sad to see that such kind of band is called metal today. If you compare it with the old metallica (1981-'91) you'll see my point. <br /> This band is right up there with jessica simpson , britney spears , eminem , n'stync in the MTV hall of fame. <br />
0679805273|2.0|Don't get me wrong- Dr. Suess is king of children's books. But I have had this book read to me so many times: at the end of 3rd grade, 4th grade, summer camp, sixth grade, etc, that I am completely sick of it.<br /><br />If you are planning on reading this to someone in a crossroads situation, don't. It's kind of like a good Top 40s song. You love it at first, but when it is repeated and repeated, you start to resent it. Don't do this to someone you care about!
B000002H97|4.0|great album, metallica shows they aren't afraid to make a soft song(unforgiven) and some harder stuff (holier than thou, enter sandman, wherever i may roam) all on the same album. the first time i bought this album i lost it in a poker match with my best friend and maybe 4 months later i went out to get it again <br /> <br />best songs are: enter sandman, unforgiven, wherever i may roam, sad but true, holier than thou, and the god that failed
B00030590I|1.0|When I saw first saw hero, It was an import version the one of my friends had brought back from china in early 2004.  I really wanted to see this movie, but after I watched it, I felt disappointment and irritation over the over written script, and the poorly delivered outcome.  The movie had too much going on at times, and not enough going on at other times.  At least in crouching tiger, hidden dragon, it never had too much going on.  I also disliked the message of the movie, it seems forced upon the audience.  While I wont give away the ending for anyone who wants to see this movie, I will say this: it seems like propaganda, like a movie that the chinese government wants you to see.  But that is just what I thought.  Oh, and by the way, my friend didnt like the movie eather.
B0001906O0|5.0|The Cure. Join the Dots: B-Sides & Rarities, 1978-2001<br /><br /> I give this boxed set of the Cures B-Sides and rarities five stars because it collects all together another side of this amazing band for Cure fanatics in a very attractive and informative package. I owned some of these B-sides, but a lot of it I didn't have and some of it wasn't released until now so as a huge Cure fan I was really happy to receive this as a Christmas present. The quality of the music is at times uneven, but that's virtually a given considering this is a collection of B-Sides and rare tracks. If you have the first collection of the Cure's videos, the VHS tape Staring at the Sea, then you will recognize many of these tracks as the music they used for the background soundtrack during the footage they showed between each video. Robert Smith's occasionally spiteful humor is hilariously showcased by the faux German on \\"Do the Hansa\\" which was a pisstake against their first label who wanted to turn them into a cute boy cover band. Similarly, to fulfill their contract with Electra in the U.S., they turned in a eleven second (!!!) version of their cover of the Doors \\"Hello I love You\\". (They later turned in a proper, more conventional version. All three versions they recorded are included.) I originally thought that the boxed set was indeed a box, but instead like other box sets it is a sturdy book with the four CDs on the inside of the covers with a 78 page booklet in the middle of the spine detailing how these tracks fit into the history of the Cure. The text of the booklet (which is printed on very heavy paper) is placed over numerous photos of the band (some of which I had never seen before now) and of the single jackets, ala how Ten Imaginary Years was produced. In fact, in some ways the booklet could be seen as a sequel to TIY, at least until a longer version is hopefully released. If you're a dedicated Cure fan then this collection is a must have.
B0000029DD|5.0|Grace, Jeff Buckley's sole album to be released before his tragic death, is absolutely stunning and grows stronger upon each listen.  Buckley's voice is instantly captivating with his amazing vocal range, going from entirely angelic to powerful and demanding.  The album starts off with \\"Mojo Pin,\\" with its slow, quiet fade in blowing up into a moment of sustained musical bliss as Buckley shows what a gift his voice was.  This is followed by the sensational \\"Grace\\" and \\"Last Goodbye\\" which are every bit as amazing as the intro.  \\"Grace\\" contains the single most amazing display of Buckley's vocal prowess as he holds out his notes for what seems like an eternity.  \\"Eternal Life\\" and \\"Dream Brother\\" close out the album with a one-two punch, the lyrics of the former becoming incredibly ironic after Buckley's unfortunate drowning in the Mississipi.  The rest of the album is equally amazing and though there may be a few hints of prentention as Buckley tries to impress perhaps beyond his abilities, they are fleeting criticisms as the music on this disc is down-right beautiful.  Sensual, heavenly, and sexy throughout the course of the disc (and sometimes simultaneously), Grace is quite possibly the greatest musical triumph of the 90s and Jeff Buckley will not soon be forgotten.
B00005JKN9|3.0|Or impressively disgusting, take your pick.  After watching this movie you grow to despise Bill the butcher so much that its jarring to realize while watching Daniel Day Lewis in the bonus features that it really was all an act.  Adding to the intense realism of the storytelling is the incredible movie set built in Rome's Cine Cita movie lot in only 5 months.   <br />Scorcese's storytelling is revolting but then you think this(or something close to it) really is part of American history. And as corrupt as politicians are now, as bleak as life today may seem, it's nowhere near as horrible as life in this NYC slum during the mid 19th century. <br />It is a monumental cinematic achievement.  Daniel Day Lewis gives an amazing performance.  But the overall effect is just overwhelming in a bad way.  The violence is over the top.
B000002H33|5.0|this album is probably the best speed metal album i've ever heard. its too bad that metallica lost cliff burton right after this album though. kirk and james put in a lot of good guitar solos too, and lars ulrich is simply an amazing drummer, most possibly metallicas best stuff (check out ride the lightning though) <br /> <br />best songs are: battery, master of puppets,welcome home, and leper messiah
B00005JNBQ|5.0|We bought this DVD for our son for Christmas. When he started watching it, I was in the room and had no intention of sitting through it. However, I was sucked into it immediately. I sat through the entire movie and laughed out loud many times. Disregard the people who say this is not a good/funny movie. Obviously, they just didn't \\"get it\\". It stands on its own as a comedy. \\"Over-rated\\"? Hardly. I know I'll be watching this movie again ... and laughing out loud!
B00001NFCY|4.0|I love it! I love the fact that it is very different form \\"My Own Prison\\" (which is very good, yet kind of depressing) \\"Human Clay\\" is upbeat & it Rocks! I LOVE \\"What If\\"?  and of course \\"Higher\\" \\"Beautiful\\" \\"Say I\\" \\"Faceless Man\\"  my question is WHY do they put \\"With Arms Wide Open\\" TWICE on the CD? I hate,hate,hate that song! Especially the eerie heartbeat, ew! lol <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|First I want to thank Green Day for coming to Monterrey, the show was totally fantastic and I have to say that I was totally surprised with the good musicians and people they are, the concert was just perfect. Now talking about the CD I have to say that it's has a new green day sound that I totally love. It can be a more \\"mature\\" sound but it stills has a lot of rythm and kicks ass. My favorite songs on this Cd are \\"Holydays\\" and \\"Boulevard of broken dreams\\", and believe me that they play them very good live! <br />Excelent green day album
B0001NBMBC|5.0|this is an awesome and crazy album, just because slipknot made 2 or so accoustic songs (and they're both actually good) doesnt mean that they are gonna do that all the time. and all the hard stuff is really good too. so dont let other people tell you that slipknot has lost their touch, corey has a great voice and jim,mick, and paul make this album very heavy, and dont forget joey jordison is one of the most amazing drummers ever.<br /><br />best songs are: duality,opium of the people, vermillion (pt.1/2) circle, pulse of the maggots, and before i forget<br /><br />buy this cd now
0767834739|4.0|I enjoyed this movie from beginning to I think the end or was it the beginning.  This film was terrific and I loved it except the end was not really the end, instead it positioned itself as chapeter two of ?? don't know how many more, but I hope it will be released soon. Don't like paying for a whole movie and finding out it is not the whole one. The Movie was done well, and lots of the same and more from the fist flick.  Yep, it is worth buying.
B000002VMD|5.0|This is simply a Wonderful soundtrack.  I still play this CD today,it just simply embraces the movie.  The artist that are featured , Kenny G, Lisa Stansfield, Cole & Civilles and the Star  of this film Whitney  are Simply The Best,   <br />I Love the following songs, . <br />1 I Will Always Love You - She (whitney) IS REGAL AND AND EMBRACING.   <br />2.

AWESOME <br /> <br />
B000003TA4|5.0|Limp Bizkit, Hoobastank, and all the other studio bands need to just give up. Its insulting to your intelligence. Nirvana was real--this is the best album of the past 25 years (Rolling Stone Magazine). You dont have to like Kurt Kobain or grunge but if you cant appriciate him and this album then dont bother puting on the radio.
0525457585|5.0|This book is pure magic, and it is a feast for the imagination.  In The Neverending Story, Michael Ende has created a magical world in the Neverending Story that is a joyful journey to depart upon.  Wonderful fantasy and characters, and also meaning and life lessons.<br /><br />Bastien is a small picked-on boy with a lifesize imagination, who picks up a book called the NEVERENDING STORY, that takes him on a magical adventure. Written in a book within a book format, Bastien soon becomes part of the Neverending Story.  Fantastical characters abound (this is Fantastica after all), Falkor, the luckdragon, Atreyu, the hero Greenskin.  They are all special.  There are even some scary beings in Fantastica, because Fantastica is the land of the imagination, and all beings are special within the imagination, all are equal because they exist.<br /><br />Bastien is chosen for a mission to provide the Childlike Empress with a new name.  With her the fate of Fantastica rests. Bastien is a human, and humans and Fantasticans have always had a precarious relationship.  They need each other, but humans tend to take Fantastica for granted, and deny its existence, making room for lies and delusions in the human world.  Fantastica needs and relies upon the human world, and is taken over by the NOTHING if humans stop believing.<br /><br />Come along with Bastien on his adventures.  You will get sucked in, trust me.  And maybe you will come away a little bit braver, and a little more loving, and more apt to discover the adventures of everyday life, as a human, and also find the way to FANTASTICA!
B00028HBKM|5.0|I have just read a few of the reviews and I am amazed that some people just don't get it, but I guess some never got it then either! I thought Mel, did a great job at this film, I'm impressed. I am a Catholic and thought it was something that I needed to see regardless of what the reviews were. I am so glad I did... I was overwhelmed. I've advised all who have a faith in Christ or are curious about Him should see it, with gore and all. As for the subtitles, I'm used to them, so I can understand if people have a hard time reading the story as they are trying to watch the movie.  But I am fimiliar with the story of the passion too. But as a general guide give it a chance... I want to see it again, and it left me wanting to know more about what happened next....
B00004W510|5.0|In 1968, The Band wrote the manifesto for a revolution of simplicity with MUSIC FROM BIG PINK. The self-titled second album, however, was the revolution itself. Ignoring the excesses of psychedelia, The Band based their lyrics around the America of the late-1800s that I passed a Social Studies class about in the early 90s. Many of the themes of that course I took in school are even more present here than on the first album, either explicitly (\\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\\", \\"King Harvest\\") or implicitly (\\"Across The Great Divide\\", \\"Rag Mama Rag\\"). Overall, this album is essential for any fan of rootsy rock & roll, as well as for anyone who had a \\"B\\" average or higher in U.S. History, whether in high school or college.
B00005Y1Y3|3.0|Here I will insert my detailed review of this album which is taken from the comments section over at MarkPrindle.com   I can be reached at cddude24@yahoo.com for any questions or comments.  ----------------------  I'll start this off by saying that I'm a huge fan of The Doors. I have all six of their albums with Jimbo, Other Voices, Full Circle, In Concert, I've heard their box set, and I attended one of their concerts this year under the name \\"The Doors Of The 21st Century.\\" It was with a live bassist and drummer that was actually better then John Densmore, singing for them was Ian Astbury, {yeah the 80s Cult singer who belted out 'Fire Woman,' to Mtv,} who was absolutely astonishing. Whether you actively despise the Cult or not...this man could sing those songs margins BETTER than the untrained Morrison and the soul and the energy that night was unbelievable. You can purchase Doors Of The 21st Century live albums at [...] ...it'll blow your mind. And you're wallet if you're not careful.    Anyway, Live In America to me is another document of Mr. Manzarek, Mr. Krieger, and Johnny \\"Appleseed\\" Densmore being in their signature psychedelic trance that made everything the Doors ever did so enjoyable, {it's as Ray once said, \\"people say this is Jim's music. It's not. Jim never made music, he wrote words,\\"} with an often unenthusiastic [and uninspired] Morrison on top. His commentary is often philosophically brilliant however, as stated, moments like \\"Bellowing,\\" are god-awful and it often doesn't get a whole lot better. Always interesting but now in the 21st century when the Doors have an extensive catalogue of official material, bootlegs [of better quality], and a touring band that features the key original members, songs, and a singer who is alive and can really keep up, Live In America I find is merely inferior.     --- Jon Blanton 2004 (C) cddude24@yahoo.com
0316666343|3.0|I must admit:  I am all about endings and as great as this book was from the very first paragraph, the ending ruined it for me.  I won't give anything away of course but in comparison to the rest of the book I was very surprised.  The writing is beautiful.  Seeing the world from this little girl's eyes is so touching and heart-wrenching all at the same time.  Was it worth the read despite the end....yes.
0553712837|1.0|The only reason this horribly written, dull and pointless story was published is because of John Grisham's name. I like him as an author, but this book (CD, in my case) is unbelievably bad. Even after listening for four torturous hours, I'm not sure what the point of the story is --- skip Christmas because it's too commercial, or don't skip it because of tradition. Just bad, bad, bad, all the way around.
B00003CWL6|5.0|A satire about middle-class modern American life, American Beauty is a cut above other satires because it has heart and a complex understanding of its characters. Kevin Spacey, who plays a disaffected, cynical father alienated from his wife and daughter, wins our sympathy even as he tries to reclaim his youth by listening to Led Zeppelin, smoking pot, and flipping burgers at a fast-food joint. His character growth in the film makes American Beauty transcend another nihilistic exploration so that the film's analysis of the American Dream ranks up there with Midnight Cowboy and The Graduate as a masterfully articulated rebuke of our blind pride and infatuation with our middle-class trappings. If you like American Beauty, you might check a less celebrated satirical film that came out the same year and that tackles similar themes, Election. For an even more depressing look at middle-class America, check out the 1997 film starring Julianne Moore called Safe.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|We all know the movie was great, but after watching the dvd, i noticed one of the best features on it was a section that filled the holes in the storyline up in a comic style form. With voice overs from the actors and comic drawings onscreen. They filled in a few plot holes that many other movies fail to do. <br /> <br />One of the best uses in dvd since motion menus
B00007ELEL|5.0|The whole thing is worthy of constant reference and is infinitely quotable...this is a brilliant, perfect movie. It's exponentially funnier with each viewing. The Dude is a Jesus like figure who exemplifies modern slackdom. He's a lackadaisical, cannabis-smoking anti-hero, whose ambition is limited to bowling and drinking White Russians. <br /> <br />THE DUDE: That's just like, your opinion, man.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|I like to comment on the statement regarding the Armenians and our instrument. Many of us have watched this amazing film thinking in our heads how amazing this instrument known as duduk is with such powerful movie. We are handful of people born and raised in a little country which many people dont even know that it exsists. Armenia the former Russian republic lies right in between the Red and the Black Sea also on top of a hated country due to our history Turky. For this film its a must see and the score truly amazing. At first I though this had to been the work of Hanz Zimmer but I was ver suprised it was Gabriel.  It does hurt a little knowing he didn't give any credit or even mention the man behind the original score Mr Gasbarian who had played that piece with the duduk to long ago before this piece. But, I guess we dont need any recognition in writing. We know this was our musical instrument and piece which was chosen in such great movie and we also know we are the first christians to practice christianity in the world. You can only listen then realise how amazing this piece is. Hikaz Boston USA
6305508550|5.0|What's amazing about this satire of office life--its cubicle-enclosed dehumanization, its absurd rules, its malignant memoes, its dysfunctional employees--is that everyone who has an office job and has seen the film bears witness to the fact that the grotesqueries in Office Space bear a realistic reflection to their real job. If anything, people at the office have anecdotes and employee profiles that are even more insane than those rendered in the film, which has become a sort of manifesto for those who are disenchanted with their office jobs. If you are a fan of this film, you might want to pick up a nonfiction memoir by Ian Levison called A Working Stiff's Manifesto.
B000000OQF|5.0|I love all the songs on here they're great. I am 18 years old and most of my friends are listening to things like Limp Bizkit,and Linkin'Park, and they think those bands sound good. I heard \\"sweet child o' mind\\" and \\"welcome to the jungle\\" and I bought the CD right after and learned all of there music was GREAT. I was only one when they came out and 17 years later I'm listening to there music saying it's great, better than any rock band I have ever heard, that should tell you this kind of Rock N'Roll doesn't die. I find modernized rock dying before Guns N'Roses rock ever does.
B00003CWTI|5.0|Characters in completely different situations are connected through the feeling of loneliness, despair, or hope happening at the same moment in time. A masterpiece movie that gets under one's skin and grows in retrospect. At over three hours, Magnolia may seem rambling, but every little piece of the film means something and is there for a reason. This is the only movie with Tom Cruise that I could ever recommend. I think you have to be able to relate to this one to have any appreciation for it though, but I could be wrong.  <br /> <br />This is one of my all time favorite soundtracks. Aimee Mann, who incidentally was the inspiration for a few of the story lines, singing \\"Save Me\\", \\"Wise Up\\" and covering Harry Nilsson is a thing of beauty.  <br /> <br /> <br />CLAUDIA: Now that I've met you would you object to never seeing me again?
B000268QB2|5.0|With all the new bands striving to get the 1980's new wave/post-punk/romanticism down just as it used to be, Keane comes along and actually gets it right. Although I've enjoyed the other bands--Coldplay, Snow Patrol, Interpol, The Music, The Killers, White Stripes, Jet, The Strokes, etc. Keane managed to make a great album this year--and their debut no less!<br /><br />Opening with the moving \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" the band follow through song after song with \\"This Is The Last Time\\", \\"Bend and Break\\", \\"Everybody's Changing\\", \\"Sunshine\\", \\"Untitled 1\\" and \\"Bedshaped\\". A thoroughly consistent and emotionally rewarding album, \\"Hopes & Fears\\" shows great promise for the future.<br /><br />It is certainly true that Keane resemble Coldplay and Snow Patrol, but there's something unearthly about lead singer Tom Chaplin's vocals and his ability to emote and tap certain feelings through his talented voice. Tim Rice-Oxley's keyboard arrangements are some of the most inspiring in pop today--Elton John would be proud! For me, \\"Hopes & Fears\\" is the perfect melancholic album, and certainly ranks closely with The Cure's \\"Disintegration\\" and anything by The Smiths or Morrissey.<br /><br />I embrace and welcome all the bands who are bringing new wave back for a second wave and Keane just happens to be one of the finest.
0345347951|5.0|There is a consensus regarding Clarke being one of the best sci-fi authors of the time. This book is one of Clarke's best works. Different than the 2001 and Rama series, which comprise 3 or 4 volumes, this is a one book wonder. Thus, it is a must. <br />Childhood's End brings us a sublime and visionary story. As in many of Clarke's works, its linked somehow to myths and beliefs of humankind. And its provocative thesis will make you question some of this beliefs. <br />I might add that, as in the Rama series, you will find (more at the end of the story) fascinating descriptions of events and situations that only Clarke's restless mind could think of.  <br />Get this book. Even if you're not into sci-fi, I venture to say you will enjoy it. And, expect the unexpected. <br />
078062999X|5.0|Hamlet was meant to be performed in this way; with amazing costumes and scenery, the play in its entirety, and of course, an excellent cast. I can't much stress how good the cast is, as they all look and sound and characterize their parts perfectly, from the main stars to the minor roles. I could not pick out one actor or actress who does not fit the role they were given to perfection, including the people one doesn't normally imagine doing Shakespeare--Williams and Crystal, for instance, were very good. It's a star-studded cast, yes, but that's not the important thing; the important thing is that they put on the best version of Hamlet, the entire Hamlet, in the best way possible, the way Shakespeare would have ordered it. In that goal the makers of this movie succeeded most admirably and they should all be given mad props and big hugs.<br /><br />Well, the ONLY actor who was NOT what I imagined for the character was Yorick, but luckily he was only glimpsed for a short time. I liked the image I had of Yorick the jester, and the Yorick in the movie was decidedly scary-looking. Still, it's nice that they included a flashback of him at all, to enrich the scene. And much of the movie is very funny, including the way Hamlet says the third \\"words\\" and \\"except my life\\" to Polonius, and moments when people get slapped.<br /><br />Of course, if you've got no understanding or appreciation for Shakespeare you won't enjoy sitting through four hours of it. I find it surprisingly fun to watch all the way through despite its length, but then, not everyone is like me. Take my advice, though, and don't try to have kids thirteen or younger watch it! I tried and it didn't work well at all. My mistake. However, it is, in my humble opinion, the best Shakespeare movie. And after having read all the reviews, I noted one that made me laugh; Kate Winslet was a great Ophelia, it's true (her madness was awesome and believable), but someone complained her name was last in the cast list on the cover. It would be wise to note...that the list is in alphabetical order by last name. I kinda figured that out the first time I looked at the box. But, that's just me. And though the film itself makes great use of mirrors for major scenes, it ultimately works quite well and creates an odd sense of, \\"Am I really looking in a mirror? It seems like I could be just looking at them.\\"<br /><br />All in all, a fabulous, passionate movie. It's THE definitive Hamlet because it's got ALL of Hamlet because it's all supposed to be in there; it's all important. Now all it needs is to be put on DVD, perhaps?cover.

B00005LQ04|5.0|When Suspiria came out in 1977, the American tagline that played on the radio and on TV stated, \\"The only thing scarier than the last 10 minutes of 'Suspiria' is the first 92!\\"  Or something like that.  This is very true.  The end of this film is very anti-climatic and sort of unsatisfying, but the rest?  Pure fear, anticipation, suspense, and beautiful imagery. <br /> <br />The first 15 or so minutes of this movie are simply incredible.  The first time I watched \\"Suspiria,\\" I was alone in my apartment with the lights off.  The credits start with a menacing soundtrack by Goblin, and a narrator (who we never hear from again, perhaps only added in the English version) states that Suzy Bannion traveled to Germany to attend a prestigous dance academy.  The music crescendos to a fury, then all is silent as we open on Suzy at an airport.  As the automatic doors open and shut, the music effectively cuts in and out, and Suzy walks out into a violent rainstorm.  From this point on, Suspiria grabs a hold of you and doesn't let go. <br /> <br />For those of you used to newer, slick horror movies such as the \\"Scream\\" trilogy or the new \\"Dawn of the Dead,\\" \\"Suspiria\\" will be hard to take (rent, don't buy).  After the initial murder scene, the movie slows down a little for exposition, but is still full of creepy imagery:  Suzy walks through a hallway and sees the cook and a little boy sitting and watching her.  The cook flashes a knife reflection across Suzy's face, and we see the dust particles in the light as the soundtrack builds menacingly; the auditorium full of sleeping students is drenched in red as Suzy hears about the mysterious directoress (sleeping behind them, behind a hung sheet) from a friend. <br /> <br />Many people will have problems with the dubbing:  Italian movies (at that time, at least) were filmed without voice recording - the lines were dubbed post-production.  Jessica Harper, who played Suzy, has commented that she would have scenes with women who were speaking Italian and German as she spoke her lines in English.  In the scene with the professor, she commented that he spoke entirely in German, and had to tug on her skirt to give her the cue for her next line.  It's a testament to Jessica Harper that she was still able to emote with all the confusion. <br /> <br />\\"Suspiria\\" is a masterpiece of brilliant colors and lighting (it was filmed using a Technicolor process, one of the last films to do so).  Once you accept the dubbing and the fact that \\"Suspiria\\" is somewhat dated (especially the special effects), you can enjoy it.  There is much suspense and anticipation, and the murder scenes are innovative.  Like I said, if you're hesitant about any of it, rent the movie before buying it (seriously - you should always preview before you purchase).
B00005JMJ4|2.0|I get the feeling the reason many people like this film is for the cinematography, which is admittedly artfully done, because they are Johansson and/or Murray fans, or because they have the same condescending, dry, humor this movie has.<br /><br />I saw the two main characters as snobs, who couldn't be bothered to respectfully engage with Japanese people, because they have \\"funny accents\\". And besides their own problems were just so huge. Please...Spare me, the insignificant depressions of the characters in this film.<br /><br />Married to the wrong man?<br /><br />GET A DIVORCE.<br /><br />Don't like your TEMPORARY job, but getting paid lots of money for it?<br /><br />SUCK IT UP AND WORK LIKE A PROFFESSIONAL UNTIL YOU'RE DONE.<br /><br />Lonely?<br /><br />STOP ACTING LIKE A SNOB and maybe people will like you. OR maybe you'll meet another snob, like Johansson's character did. :-)<br /><br />For those who sit back and laugh sarcasticly, rather than engage on any real level, I think any alienation they feel is their own fault. Therefore, I couldn't relate to the main characters' \\"dilemma\\" in this film.<br /><br />This film is supposedly Coppola's \\"love-letter\\" to Japan. I guess to some, expressing love means treating the people and aspects of their culture as funny props rather than fully, realized, human beings.<br /><br />I found this film dull and offensive. I think this film is for those who are amused by the same things the main characters in this film are: Laughing derisively at \\"funny accents\\" and the \\"funny people\\" they never bother to get to know.
B00005B0PU|5.0|I don't understand why The Zombies aren't up there with The Beatles and The Beach Boys.  I love listening to them for the same reasons I love listening to The Zombies: First of all, the music is just fantastic with no explanation needed at all - it's just fantastic.  And Second of all, for the fun, clever, beautiful melodies and masterful harmonies.  The Zombies are still uniquely original with there smooth cool vocals, jazz influenced style, there own version of production perfection, they've got Rod Argent on the keyboards, I don't know, the album speaks for itself.  I've put the CD on for different people and because it's so timeless they thought it was some new band that was bringing a new sound or something.  I think that timelessness is possibly the best trait a piece of music can have.  And this totally has it.    This version of the album is the best I've found.  Or the Zombie Heaven box set.  But if you're not into the whole demo version thing, this CD and Begin Here with the German bonus tracks is a great combo and gets all the released tracks pretty much covered.  That's a fantastic CD too.  Both are musts, but Odessey & Oracle is a must more.  No.  Wait.  Get both.  But get Odessey & Oracle first.  A greatest hits won't do.  You would really miss out if you just got one greatest hits CD.  Each song is truly great.  That's something that's really rare.  The album itself is a masterpiece and the bonus tracks are a must have.  You'll understand when you get the CD.  The more you listen to The Zombies, the more you fall in love with their music.  Eventually you'll run out of Zombies songs to individually obsess over and you will be sad.  But then you'll remember that you have both Begin Here and Odessey & Oracle with all these bonus tracks and you will be happy once again.  The end.
B00025ETIW|5.0|I first learned of My Chemical Romance on Purevolume.com, a site that is just great if you're looking for up and coming bands.  Anyways, I downloaded some of theire stuff and liked what I heard.  After hearing \\"I'm Not Okay\\" on Burnout 3 I was obsessed with the song.  Soon after I bought Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge.  It was the best 12.99 I've ever spent.   <br /> <br />Sure the lead singer doesn't have a \\"good\\" voice for most people's standards but I love it.  Every song has certain lines you'll just start singing out of nowhere (In quotations).  You know, I'm going to save myself some time:  Every song has a great pace and amzing lyrics. There.  <br /> <br />I really dont have \\"A Favorite\\" since they're all SO good!  The only thing I don't like about these guys gaining popularity is that people like me, who liked them before they were popular get mad when others start singing \\"I'm not okay\\" like they're hardcore fans. <br /> <br />1. HELENA- (9):  Great opener. \\"So long and goodnight!\\" <br /> <br />2. GIVE EM HELL KID- (8.5): I love the opening!: \\"I Took a train out of New Orleans.\\" <br /> <br />3. TO THE END- (9):  Great lyrics.  \\"Say goodbye!...\\" <br /> <br />4. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DO TO GUYS LIKE US IN PRISON- (8):  This song gets the longest title award.  \\"I wont go down by myself!\\" <br /> <br />5. I'M NOT OKAY- (10): Such an amazing song.  This was their first big hit. There are so many great lines in this song but my favorite is: \\"Remeber when you broke your foot from jumping out the second story\\" <br /> <br />6. THE GHOST OF YOU- (9): Slower song but still great. \\"And all the things that you never ever told me\\" <br /> <br />7. THE JETSET LIFE IS GONNA KILL YOU- (7):  This is still a pretty good song but when you're spoiled with 11 other great songs, this one seems a little bland.  I still listen to it frequently.  \\"Check into the Hotel Bella Muerte\\" <br /> <br />8. INTERLUDE- (NA):  Not much to say here.  It does it's job and is short. <br /> <br />9. THANK YOU FOR THE VENOM- (8.5):  Opening guitar is sweet! \\"So give me all your poison.\\" <br /> <br />10. HANG EM HIGH- (9.5):  One of my favorites.  Has really grown on me.  \\"Call her black Mariah, would I lie to you.\\" <br /> <br />11. IT'S NOT A STATEMENT, IT'S A DEATHWISH- (8.5):  The opening line is great: \\"For what you did to me, and what I'll do to you, <br />you get, what everyone else gets, you get a lifetime!\\" <br /> <br />12. CEMETARY DRIVE- (8)- Intruiging lyrics with a great guitar. \\"Well now I miss you.\\" <br /> <br />13. I NEVER TOLD YOU WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING- (7.5) A good song, just not one of my personal favorites. \\"They gave us two shots to the back of the head\\" <br /> <br />All in all, Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge is a CD you'll be glad you bought.  I honestly would've paid $30 for this.  Do yourself a favor and grab this.  Best Buy certainly has been advertising the heck out of it!
B000005JA8|5.0|That is, IF you're already familiar with the context in which it was made. It's really not that hard to grasp. There are tonal parts, parts in 4/4, and familiar repetition. Then there are atonal, polyrhythmic/arhythmic, perhaps confusing parts for contrast. Composers have been using that technique for decades. And hell everything follows basic blues structure. It doesn't get simpler than that.  <br /> <br />Basically, I think this album gets a lot of unfair criticism because it's tied into the pop world in which all of the aforementioned properties are no-no's, and labeled as pretentious. But when you hold it up to the twelvetone movement or the free jazz movement, this album is pretty accessible. Even the rambling, sometimes nonsensical lyrics support the album's feel. <br /> <br />When approaching this album, a lot of people describe it as \\"noise\\" which probably leads a lot of people to expect a variation of a Sonic Youth or a Velvet Underground. But those albums are still pop at their heart. To make an incomplete and understated description: This album is hard, classic blues mangled by mid-twentieth century compositional techniques and further influenced/distorted in the spirit of free jazz. Its rock influence gained it noteriety at the tail of a downward spiral that was 60's drug culture, when in fact no one was on drugs while making this album (Just like Zappa, Vliet never tolerated drugs in the Magic Band.) <br /> <br />So will you enjoy Beefheart or TMR? A survey of hardcore Beefheart fans on the main Beefheart website revealed they listened most to the following artists (abridged by me): Zappa/Mothers (obviously), Miles, Tom Waits, Coltrane, Grateful Dead, Can, Peter Ubu, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Igor Stravinsky, The Fall, Robyn Hitchcock, Daevid Allen, Ornette Coleman. If these names have you scratchingv your head, then it might not be a great idea to just jump into Capitan Beefheart. Or  maybe it is, if you have the right outlook. Just remember you learned to swim in the shallow water before jumping off the high dive. To finish with a quote: <br /> <br />\\"Come mothers and fathers throughout all the land <br />And don't criticize what you can't understand\\" <br />-Bob Dylan

B000660UN0|5.0|I've been disappointed in Clapton's material like Pilgrim and Reptile as too pop and uninspiring. But when he goes back to where his heart lies, he shines. This DVD/CD set is great. The DVD blew me away. It's so intimate, so personal, you feel as though you're in the room when the band is playing. The sounds is great. Clapton shows his passion for the blues and gives us a fascinating portrait of a musician working at his craft. This is the work that every Clapton fan waits for and why he's one of the greatest. Put it up there with Layla, Cradle to the Grave and Unplugged.

B000750OEA|5.0|This dvd was released here in Kylie's birthplace, Melbourne at a local gay pub some weeks ago. Unfortunately I missed the event but I bought the dvd for Xmas for my partner. It was actually cheaper than buying the CD, so it was a great deal. <br /> <br />The 2 menus are stunning and the songs are in chronological order starting with 'I should be so lucky' and ending with 'Chocolate' and 2 bonus videos. You can watch all songs with the lyrics if you choose. <br /> <br />It is great to see how Kylie progresses from the innocent young girl who has \\"Got to be certain\\" of a boy's intentions before she gets intimate, to the woman who surrounds herself with sexy male bodies writhing in speedos by the pool in 'Slow'. <br /> <br />From a recent interview it appears that Kylie still has major goals to achieve. It seems that her modesty, hard work, respect for and willingness to learn from others brings her continued success. <br /> <br />Of course her brilliant career may have come at the expense of relationships and starting a family, but her power to inspire and entertain is a great gift to the world. <br /> <br />Also watch her sparkle in short scenes in 'Moulin Rouge' and the third series of 'Kath and Kim'.
B000687M48|5.0|This is one of the best live recordings I've ever seen and heard.  The DVD is superbly edited, the videos are fun, and the quality of both the CD and the concert are outstanding.  Singing live is the true test for a vocalist and Lee proves herself incomparable.
B00004YRQA|5.0|This is a memory card, if you don't know WHAT that is, it's this small square shaped card that you slip into your Playstation 2 right above where the control plugs in, the PS2 has two slots so if you wanted to get two you can easily use them both at the same time. Because it's made for PlayStation2 it will only be compatible for Playstation 2. <br /> <br />Why you need it? If you are playing a video game and you  unlock something new inside the video game, or get to a new place you can save your progress on the memory card so you can resume where you left off instead of having to start all over again. <br /> <br />How much will it hold? The memory card in question holds 8 megabytes, which is more then enough to hold tons of saves, if you want you can delete your save files for space. <br /> <br />How trusty is it? Because this memory card is made by Sony, the same company that makes the Playstation2 consoles, you can trust that it will fit in perfectly with your PS2 and will last as long as you own the system, I've known people that've been using this thing for over three years. <br /> <br />Overall it's an extremly usefull tool that you will be using constantly and will last as long as you own the system.

B00005MP58|5.0|I ususally don't care for romances, preferring action, adventure, and wildlife shows to the touchy-feeliness of Jane Austen.<br /><br />But...Pride and Prejudice is a remarkable piece of work.<br /><br />From the breathtaking beauty of the English countryside, to the dramatic tension of the story-line, to the exquisite acting, I found myself hanging on every word and hooting and hollering as Lizzie gives stuffed-britches Darcy what-for.<br /><br />Distinctions of class, royalty, social status and wealth separate the characters and pit them against each other. You can almost see the hand of time sweeping away the puny efforts of man and his pride and privelage. But the passions remain, in full force, in this beauty of a story.<br /><br />An elegant drama - enjoyable in every respect!
B000063V8R|4.0|Season 3 of TNG is the best season of the entire series. Some of my favorites from season 3 include: \\"The Defector\\", \\"The Hunted\\", \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\" and \\"The Best Of Both Worlds\\". This is a must have for any star trek fan.
B0002OXVFU|3.0|This was a great deal and I'm glad that I picked them up, the big problem though came with the packaging.  The two movies were shrink wrapped together and in the shrink wrap there was a stick hold the two together.  It was impossible to get the sticker off without ripping the covers of the two cases!!! BIG THUMBS DOWN TO THAT.  The movies are great though.
B00005A46T|1.0|We've all heard of people dismissing Slipknot just because they're popular and a \\"nu-metal\\" band, but it struck me that until this album I had never really heard anything from this infamous band, other than that Vermilion song while channel-hopping. That didn't strike me as a particularly good song, but I still decided to check this out and make sure once and for all that I either liked or hated Slipknot, and after listening to this album carefully, it really isn't anything special at all. On first listen I stopped the CD at the beginning of Skin Ticket, realising that there were still a few songs left to bear, and I just couldn't take any more. It's clear that there is some talent in the members of Slipknot. If nothing else, Joey Jordison is a talented drummer, but the songs Slipknot are producing are the usual \\"nu-metal\\" garbage. The songs on here all seem to sound the same, there is no real variation, nothing that really grabs me, no well-thought out riffs that stick in your head, and this really gets irritating after a while listening to it. The guitarists never really show off what they can do, they're just stuck in the background playing some boring riff. <br /> <br />If there is an alright song here it's Gently, for once on the CD the music slows and there is some good acoustic guitar work. The lyrics are also better than the usual \\"F*CK EVERYTHING!!!\\" that seems to be present on a lot of the songs (the lyrics on most of the songs are amazingly poor), and more importantly, the song isn't dependent on Corey's voice, there are long bits with just the music, and we're spared from the irritating half-rapping half-screaming that he churns out relentlessly for the rest of the album. My Plague is also less annoying than some of the other tracks. Some songs are just a complete waste of time, Skin Ticket is far too long and boring when nothing really happens, I Am Hated is just your standard badly written nu-metal song, and the long ending track Iowa is another too long and boring track. At least I finally know for sure that I don't like Slipknot. If you're a fan of the band you should already have this, but if you're not a fan this doesn't deserve your attention. I feel like giving this 2 stars, but there just wasn't enough here that interested me. <br /> <br />Sort of stand-out: Gently  <br />
B0000DBJDM|5.0|For those who are fans of Floyd - or rock and roll in general, this is a must see. The footage and sound is fantastic and the behind the scenes look at them recording \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is downright priceless.  <br /> <br />Be warned however. After watching through the video I was really upset with the new additions that were made to it - with all the cheesy computer animations of space and Pompeii. Do yourself a favor and watch the \\"Original Theatrical Release\\" version of it. It's in the menu there somewhere, and it's MUCH much better.  <br /> <br />By the way - for those unaware, the Beastie Boys riffed on this video in their \\"Gratitude\\" video. Check it out.
B0002IQHY8|4.0|For Alan Parson's fans, the first cut is as good as he's done in ages. \\"Return to Tunguska\\" would have been good without David Gilmore's guitar, but Gilmore boosts it up to really exceptional status. As a classic Alan Parsons instrumental, you don't have to worry about lame lyrics, either.<br /><br />The rest of the album is listenable, but nothing else rises to the same level. Unlike some other reviewers, I liked the quirky second cut, \\"More Lost Without You\\". It doesn't sound like Parsons at all. But if you've ever had the \\"storm in your head\\" described in the lyrics, you'll be nodding along with the singer.<br /><br />The remix/redo of Mammagamma was OK, but I prefer the original, which is one of my all time favorite Parsons instrumentals. The new one is passable as a techno-electronica alternative, though I was surprised with the new intro, which has a section that sounds uncomfortably close to the Macarena (really).<br /><br />The rest is typical Parsons, with a heavier dash than usual of electronic stuff. Most of the drums seem to be electronic, for example. Some of the usual Parsons musicians are apparently replaced by machines, and I particularly miss Ian Bairnson's guitar. I didn't recoil from any of it, and it got better on successive listens. As other reviewers have noted, the remix of the first two songs on \\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\\" (combined into one song) is not an improvement over the original. I thought it was pretty pointless.<br /><br />Of the remaining songs, I thought \\"L'Arc en Ciel\\" was closest to a typical Parsons work - it's another good instrumental. I didn't care for the atonal stuff in \\"Tijuaniac\\" or the distorted voices that appear at various places in the second half of the album, but those sections are mercifully brief. \\"You Can Run\\" was OK - typical Parsons plus a dash of electronica. The album finishes off with the instrumental \\"Chromolungma\\" - not terrible, but too much techno for my taste.<br /><br />Alan Parsons continues to experiment, and while the results are not all good, this will do, as long as you can take turning the techno up another notch from his previous stuff.s continues to experiment, and while the results are not all good, this will do, as long as you can take turning the techno up another notch from his previous stuff.
B0000041CZ|5.0|I am the owner of many versions of the Well-Tempered Clavier, both volumes.  Gulda's, which I have just recently discovered, is now one of my favorites, to me equaling Glenn Gould's and Rosalind Tureck's incredible performances.  Gulda's, like Gould's, is eccentric and as dry as can be imagined; stacatto, minimal rubatto, no pedal -- often hard, sharp, even harsh. But what clarity; the lines of counterpoint stand out perfectly.  Each interlocking melody is clearly and beatufilly defined.  I'm not a big fan of \\"mushy\\" Bach playing (though some of it, like Andras Schiff's, is very fine indeed).  Here is a nice, arid rendition of Bach's keyboard masterpiece.  At a bargain price, how can you go wrong?
B00012L786|5.0|After watching Sam Fuller's 1964 classic \\"The Naked Kiss,\\" I cast my eyes in the direction of another of his memorable films. No, it wasn't \\"Shock Corridor,\\" although I plan on watching that one in the next few months. I decided to go with his 1953 picture \\"Pickup on South Street\\" for a number of reasons. One, Fuller cast Richard Widmark in the lead role. I'm familiar with this actor thanks to many of his later films, Irwin Allen's schlock masterpiece \\"The Swarm\\" among them, and I wanted to see what he could do in the earlier phases of his career. Two, I liked the idea of watching a film dealing with communism in the United States during the 1950s. With the Red Scare and McCarthyism in full bloom, I wanted to see how Fuller would fashion a film describing the government's methods for tracking down the reds. Three, and finally, an online friend who initially turned me on to Fuller had nothing but great praise for \\"Pickup on South Street.\\" Her extensive knowledge of foreign films, coupled with as good an eye for older American films, left me feeling confident that this Fuller movie would be an entertaining experience.<br /><br />\\"Pickup on South Street\\" begins with an irresistible hook that draws the viewer into the film. A pickpocket on a train in New York City lifts the contents of an attractive woman's purse while a couple of tough looking men pay close attention to what is going on. Why are these two men so interested in what the criminal is doing? Are they citizens? Police officers? Or are they far more sinister figures? Right from the start Fuller has us asking questions that we hope will find resolution later on. Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark), the criminal committing the crime, just walked out of prison after serving a few years for picking pockets. His latest crime is about to plunge him into a situation that could well result in a much, much longer sentence. The woman he robbed, Candy (Jean Peters), is actually a messenger for a guy named Joey (Richard Kiley). She carries items that he wants transported to various individuals around town, but she pays more attention to the money he gives her than the item in question. Bad mistake. It turns out that Joey is a communist stooge and spy for the Soviet Union. Candy carried in her purse a piece of microfilm containing important American secrets, and Skip walked right into the middle of the ongoing investigation to break up the spy cell. Now he's in the middle of the feds, the police, and the communists, all of whom want that microfilm.<br /><br />The guys on the train don't know the name of the pickpocket, so they go to the local police station hoping the criminal has a record. The cops bring in Moe (Thelma Ritter), a stool pigeon of some renown in the city, to help identify and track down the perpetrator. After a hilarious scene in which Moe negotiates a price for her assistance, she helps the authorities identify and track down Skip. He lives on the river in a decrepit little shack, keeps his beer cold by dunking it in the water at the end of a rope, and has no interest whatsoever in helping the authorities. Why should he? These are the same guys who sent him to the stir, and he'll go back there for some serious time if he admits he lifted Candy's purse. Appeals to McCoy on a patriotic level fail spectacularly; he's the sort of guy whose loyalty revolves around money and his few friends. Meanwhile, Joey is going ballistic.

He sends Candy out to track down Skip and retrieve the microfilm, which backfires when the two strike up a grudging respect for one another.

B0006399FS|5.0|Once again, U2 has managed to produce work that has beautiful rhythm, some great lyrics, and enough heart to make you pause.<br /><br />There wasn't a single song that I felt inclined to \\"disable\\" on my Media player.
B00004RF9I|5.0|Paddy Chayefsky's 1976 blockbuster hit \\"Network\\" is, I truly believe, the best film satire ever made. It might well be the best film regardless of genre ever made in the United States, better than \\"Citizen Kane,\\" better than \\"The Godfather,\\" better than any of the other numerous contenders. The first time I saw \\"Network\\" was on television about ten years ago, a supreme irony that became more and more amusing as the film progressed, and the powerhouse dialogue, performances, and set pieces captured my imagination unlike any other film. I have since watched this film so many times that at one point I could quote large chunks of dialogue verbatim with the greatest of ease. Over the past several years, however, I haven't seen Chayefsky's masterpiece as often as I would like. When I decided I would finally tackle the daunting prospect of writing a review for this movie, I rented the DVD version and resubmerged myself into the dark world of Howard Beale, Max Schumacher, Diana Christensen, and Frank Hackett. And I rediscovered something I always realize every time I watch this magnificent piece of cinema: \\"Network\\" is as great a movie as it was the first time I saw it, and it's prescience to our modern world continues to astonish.<br /><br />\\"Network\\" takes the viewer inside of a major television network, UBS, during the 1970s. Their prime time newscaster, Howard Beale (Peter Finch), has just received word from his boss Max Schumacher (William Holden) that the network is terminating his contract due to low ratings. Perturbed about leaving his position, and with nothing else in life to live for, Beale breaks down on television and promises his audience that he will kill himself on live television the following evening. Not surprisingly, this revelation causes quite a stir amongst the suits on the upper floors. Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall), the new overseer of the network since its acquisition by a larger corporation called CCA, threatens once again to clean house. Schumacher convinces Hackett and the other executives to hold off because Howard is essentially insane, and he even manages to get Beale back on the air the following evening in order to issue a public apology. Max has his own reasons for supporting Beale: the network is threatening to cut the budget of the news division in order to decrease the debt load, a decision they failed to notify Schumacher about beforehand. When Howard goes off on a rant about the sicknesses of American society the following evening, Max refuses to cut the live feed as a protest against the network's unfair treatment.<br /><br />Hackett hits the roof, but when entertainment division chief Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) convinces him that Beale's rants brought in a record number of viewers, a new idea quickly forms. What if the network encouraged Howard's irrational behavior? What if they made a program based solely on his prophecies about the state of modern America? That's exactly what Christensen and Hackett accomplish when \\"The Howard Beale Show\\" debuts on UBS. In front of a roaring crowd, the former newsman raves about the evils of corporatism, the corrosive effects of television, and public corruption. At the end of each tirade, Beale collapses in a faint in front of the cameras. Audiences eat these histrionics up, and ratings for the show go through the roof. UBS is well on its way to turning a profit. Meanwhile, a subplot about Max and Diana plays out. The two embark on a tempestuous love affair despite their professional quibbling about Howard and Max's longtime marriage. While Christensen sets about creating new programs highlighting left-wing revolutionary activities, programs like \\"The Mao Tse-Tung Hour,\\" Max leaves his wife and moves into Diana's apartment. Their relationship resembles a television program, and as Howard's ratings slip after he receives a readjustment to his worldview from CCA chairman Arthur Jensen (Ned Beatty), Max and Diana's union also falters. The film's conclusion is as cruel as it is darkly hilarious.<br /><br />I've never seen, nor do I expect to ever see again, a film like \\"Network.\\" Each element of the film fires on every cylinder. Time stops while watching this picture. The performances from major and minor characters are sublime, but it's Peter Finch who grabs the spotlight with both hands and refuses to let go. His Howard Beale raves, rants, gesticulates, and issues statements on the world that spellbind with their power and elegance. His monologue to Max about his mental state, his lecture to audiences about the illusion of television, and his take on corporate buyouts brings me to my feet every time I hear them. Just as memorable is Arthur Jensen's mind-blowing analysis of the true nature of the corporate universe and the ultimate fate of mankind if the citizens of the world allow his ilk to have their way. The film ends with Max Schumacher labeling Diana Christensen \\"television incarnate\\" because of her total inability to form meaningful emotional connections. In fact, the mindlessness and callousness of television, how it reduces every aspect of human sentiment and interaction to one-dimensional superficialities, ultimately destroys every character in this film.<br /><br />I could keep going ad infinitum, explaining how Max represents the common man faced with the daunting task of giving in to his cravings for television (re: Diana) or simply turning it off for good by returning to the wholesomeness of family life. I could also examine how Chayefsky shows us television destroying not only those who watch it but also those who fill the medium with images, i.e. the decision Hackett and Christensen feel they must make concerning Beale's plummeting ratings. What I really want to do is fill this review with line after line of the brilliant dialogue uttered in this film. I won't though; you need to see this tour de force motion picture for yourself. And realize how much of it pertains to our society today. Mad as hell, indeed!clusion is as cruel as it is darkly hilarious. <br /> <br />I've never seen, nor do I expect to ever see again, a film like \\"Network.\\" Each element of the film fires on every cylinder.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|I thought this movie was breathtaking, The acting was top-notch and the dialogue was incredible, adn Bill Murray was suprinsingly great in a dramatic role. One of the best movies over the past 5 years and definetly worth owning to your DVD collection. Hey Spiridian----you need a hug, :)
B00003CXBH|4.0|This is a highly enjoyable epic film.  DeNiro is his usual captivating self only this time instead of being an Italian gangster or wise guy in the 20th century, his character lives in 18th century South America. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this film because I am a DeNiro fan and I enjoy his style of acting.  It was pleasing to see him attempt a different type of role. <br /> <br />If you're a DeNiro fan, check this one out
B000001FA4|1.0|There most overrated album. Pick up Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby if you want happier music. :)
B000002JSN|4.0|Although Zepp's \\"Physical Graffiti\\" might not be as great or artistic as other double albums such as the Beatles' \\"White Album\\", Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\", or Bob Dylan's \\"Blonde on Blonde\\", this hard rock album represents a great time period for music, and Zeppelin.  \\"Custard Pie\\" and \\"Rover\\" are okay, but the first disc's best tracks are the 11-minute \\"In My Time of Dying\\", \\"Houses of the Holy\\", and the mysterious \\"Kashmir\\". <br />\\"Kashmir\\", in my opinion, is one of their best songs, and possibly their very best in Zeppelin's 1975-1980 period. <br />On their second disc, \\"In the Light\\" is good, but I'm a bit dissapointed at Graffiti's version of \\"Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\\".  It is an acoustic only, with no vocals by Plant.  I guess you'll have to buy \\"Led Zeppelin 3\\" or \\"How the West was Won\\" for the song with vocals.  All in all, this is a must for every rock fan.  I mysekf bought it for \\"Kashmir\\", \\"Houses of the Holy\\", and \\"Wanton Song\\".
0156027321|3.0|As a former English major and current busy person I was interested in this Booker Prize winning title, but (okay, I'll confess) I found the book slow.  So many times I wanted to quit as I found parts simply meandering, but part of me pressed on, and the end makes it worth-the-while.  In the end, the book fulfills its promises.  Read it, yes, but don't be alarmed if you don't exactly find it to be a page turner for the middle 200+ pages.
B000002UAU|5.0|First, to the guy who said Limp Bizkit was better than The Beatles: you suck and everyone probably thinks you're a stupid moron. I know I do. And none of the bands you listed are classic rock. <br /> <br />Anyway, this album is tied for the position of favorite album ever with Quadrophenia by The Who. The whole album is incredible! The first song opens up with great guitars and excellent vocals, and the next track, With A Little Help From My Friends, is my favorite track. On it, Ringo sings lead vocals, and he blew me away. This was no Yellow Submarine. I consider it the best track on the CD. <br /> <br />Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds is a trippy image filled journey, sung in a haunting voice by John. I love the three drum beats before the chorus. Gettign Better, the next track, is great as well. <br /> <br />When I'm Sixty Four is a great song, I love the way Paul sings it. The reprise of Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is great, and A Day In The Life is a great finale to a great album. <br /> <br />I skipped some songs, but all the songs on this album are great. Within You Without You is a little bit weird, I find it hard to listen to, but it's growing on me. <br /> <br />I reccommend that any fans of good music go out and buy this right away!!!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|OK, first of all...the alienation bit I got, but c'mon, you travel abroad to make tons of money in a foreigh land, how can you not expect loneliness...are you kidding me??? Little wife feels alone because she's traveling with her working husband. Boohoo...get a life, go for a walk or something, are we supposed to feel sorry for her cuz she's a stranger in a strange land??? As for Bill Murray`s all star performance, give me a break. The dialogue is weak, the plot is weak, the movie left me with wonder. The wonder of how a movie this \\"thin\\" and void of any substance could win anything at all.....If you don't like your life then change it and quit whinning already....stop playing the \\"poor me\\" and change what you don't like...this movie sucks...
B00000633U|1.0|The sophomore effort from the late eighties \\"Mullet King\\" (a title currently held by Scott Stap, who seized it from Billy Ray Cyrus), \\"Repeat Offender\\" more lives up to its promise:  it repeatedly offends the sensibilities of anyone with taste in music.
B00023B1LC|5.0|This movie is not like other suspense stories, because you dont get tired of it.  It is made out to be a spy movie but its so much more that that.  It is really an action movie that is like james bond except theres no ga-y english people, no fake accents, no stupid gadgets that would never work in real life, but there is a girl, and she was hot.  I thought that a movie with matt damon would suck, but hes a pretty good actor in his own genre, action- where you dont need a lot, just to look cool when you kill people.  This movie is also good because it is not dirty.  You know fromthe start that they are going to fall in love, but they never do anything bad, which is another great quality of this movie.  The only part of this movie i didnt like was when the professor dies, and when Concklin dies.  Those are the sadest parts of the movie.
B00005LOUP|3.0|How the Grinch Stole Christmas is a holiday classic, but some people may not appreciate Ron Howard's Hollywood remake with this film. It follows basically the same plot as the traditional television program, with a few added segments to make the movie a little longer.<br /><br />The best thing about this movie has to be the excellent make- up by Rick Baker. He won an Oscar for his work, and it was well- deserved. Jim Carrey (one of the other highlights of the film) looks just like the Grinch should look- with the same smile, the same face, and the same mannerisms of the original Grinch.<br /><br />The overall plot includes some added segments about the Grinch and his childhood, showing how he same to dislike Christmas so much. Ron Howard was the target of much criticism for doing this, but I feel it was undeserved criticism. He needed to make the movie a little longer and he probably wanted to make it more his own work rather than just a complete rehashing of the original. I think he does a decent job here, although I can agree that some of the scenes are a little silly.<br /><br />Overall, this is still a good film for the holiday season. Jim Carrey's goofiness and his nasty Grinch- like nature, along with the great make- up and the eye- catching set, make for a pleasant movie watching experience. It's not exactly like the original, but it's close enough that traditionalists shouldn't be too alarmed.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|I thought it was an good sequel, but by itself it was a pretty lousy movie.  There was none of the suspense of the first one where he is confused and learning what he really is.  Plus the first one has a girl...  In this one she dies like five minutes into the movie.  And they make him out to be some sort of a machine, there should have been more plot twists.  The only thing i didnt see coming was when he gets shot!!!  And that only stopped him a little bit.  I didnt like this one, but the first Bourne movie was so good, that i cant force myself to give its sequel a bad rating no matter how hard i try.
B00062J00S|5.0|It's a Wonderful Life is a movie that is synonymous with the Christmas season. This classic film from director Frank Capra is still as heartwarming today as it was decades ago when it was first released and it continues to charm more and more generations each and every holiday season.<br /><br />This movie works on every level, thanks to the story line, the directing, and the actors and actresses involved. Actor Jimmy Stewart plays the likable yet frustrated George Bailey, showing how one man can have it all and almost let it all slip away. Henry Travers plays the role of Clarence, George's guardian angel, and his appearance fits the part perfectly. The same is true of actor Lionel Barrymore in the role as the nasty Mr. Potter. With his evil smile and mean- spirited demeanor, Barrymore fits the role of the greedy CEO to a tee.<br /><br />Capra's directing is the key to making this movie work and it's doubtful that many others would have been able to duplicate his work. The plot of this movie would seem a little silly at first: man works hard, starts to feel down and out, loses track of a large sum of money, feels he is no longer appreciated, tries to commit suicide, and is rescued by a man who claims to be his guardian angel and takes him back in time to see what life would have been like if he had never been born. But Capra pulls all the elements together and creates a cinematic masterpiece.<br /><br />This movie is considered by many to be one of the greatest of all time. It certainly is a movie worth watching, during Christmas or anytime of the year. It's message is timeless, and it will continue to win over more and more fans with each passing year.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|A new strain of stronger, more virulant vampirism has developed and its carrier doesn't differentiate between human and vampire victims.  The Vampire Nation offer Blade a truce and ask him to lead their Blood Pack (a group originally in training to hunt him) in a search and destroy mission. <br /> <br />This film is dark, comedic, stylized (based on the comic book of the same name) action, and has some nice character moments, especially as the line between enemy and friend becomes blurred between Blade and Nyssa, the leader of the Blood Pack and daughter of the Vampire overlord and Blade and his newly rescued/vampire detoxed mentor Whistler.   <br /> <br />Wesley Snipes, as Blade, has cool down to a science.  Watching his fight scenes is like watching music in motion.  Luke Goss, who plays the threat and new strain of vampirism, a Reaper, although looked and dressed like hell, carried himself with elegance, definitely an aristocratic heir/son (which his character is). Ron Perlman \\"sucks\\" in the best possible way as the vampire Reinhardt. He's a nice mix of blood stopping toughness, undead cool and black humor (a vampire who chews gum? And blows bubbles during an autopsy? Thankfully it wasn't his own).  <br /> <br />The DVD has great in depth behind the scenes footage and a commentary by writer David Goyer and star Wesley Snipes and a commentary by producer Peter Frankfurt and director Guillermo Del Toro (who should get a special Academy Award for Best Movie Commentaries).
B00005JN4O|5.0|Never Say Never is the over-arching theme emerging from the film, Finding Neverland. While Depp is known for doing some of his his best work in twisted tales of insanity, drugs and violence, he is spectacular in his role of James Barrie, creator of Peter Pan.  His ability to think and act like a kid  who never wants to grow up is truly believable in this production.  His performance here will be as remarkable and--never forgotten--as his performance in Pirates of the Carribean.    Because there are grave differences in the characters that he plays in these two movies, Depp should never be described, as only an out of control actor--a director's nightmare as in Pirates of the Carribean. The control that he exhibits in Finding Neverland is ever apparent.  Here, he is astute, reflective, and all-attending to the mother, the children and his film director.    Finding Neverland also has implications for all--children and adults, alike.   Depp's professional growth as an up and coming lead actor signifies that the pursuit of our own personal neverlands should not be limited to some far-off aspect in our lives--some unknown and distant future.   Instead, we should believe in ourselves, and never give up on our dreams, only to discover that finding Neverland is all in how we define it.     Depp's redefinition of himself as a leading actor, father and significant other is bringing about new rewards.   His performance in Finding Neverland is outstanding and overwhelmingly believable.  It is apparent that Depp and James Barrie shared parallel real life experiences--creative wellsprings in a world where everything must fit nicely in a square box.  Because of the shared experience of sometimes being misunderstood as a creative genius, the role is very natural for Depp.  So, natural, that Finding Neverland should achieve Oscar rankings in a variety of areas i.e. acting, directing, filming, costuming etc.
055321263X|5.0|I became interested in Collins' novel due to it being the basis for Andrew Lloyd Webber's latest musical.  I was a bit apprehensive at first, fearing that it, like many 19th century novels, would plod along ponderously under the weight of the flowery and overly descriptive prose of the period.  I am happy to report that this is NOT the case with Collins.  Though the language is much more formal than modern novels, it flows wonderfully and he weaves a very intricate and compelling story.  At the same time, he gives the reader a wonderful view into the world of 19th century society life.  This is an outstanding piece of literature that I would highly recommend to anyone interested in mystery and adventure novels.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I think that the reasons behind some of the recent negative reviews is that the album is getting over-hyped.  I actually appreciate the hype - because without it, I would have never bought this great album.   <br />I had never heard of the band until the last week or so, when all the top albums of 2004 lists started flooding the internet.  This one was consistently in the top 3 in just about every list I looked at.  So, when I had a gift certificate that I wanted to put to good use, and found it in a small CD/DVD store for $10, I figured I'd give it a shot.   <br />I listened to it while wrapping gifts, and couldn't believe that the hype was pretty much right on.  Not everything on here is instantly accessable, and maybe that's part of why some people are dissatisfied.  I noticed a reviewer mentioning that they traded this back in the next day for 1/2 price.  Listeners with that short of an attention span aren't going to like this at all.  If you need your music to all sound the same, and be instantly likeable and familiar - get something else.   <br />If you want something that will grow on you slowly, giving you soemthing new on each listen, give this a shot.

B00005NGAK|3.0|I just recieved this as a Christmas Present in the GOld collection, and it's not bad but...when it first started playing it, I thought that I had accidently put on Lord of the Dance and they had upgraded it, and when I realized that it was in fact feet of flames i was a little disappointed.  Michael Flatley obviously can't be as creative as he and others claim for him to be.  Instead of revamping LOTD, he started a new show and added in a couple more segments.  Not really worth your money.  While as one mother from Tennesse has stated there is a bit more sex appeal in this one then the other one.  Not vulgarly so as she may have exaggerated, but tighter outfits and shorter hemlines and slight gestures.  If you would like to see both and do not previously own any of them, your better off buying the gold collection.  If not, most libraries have LOTD, so you could just buy this one, its got everything plus some.  While it's not all together horrible, but it does seem that they might be loosing sight of what they are doing.
0793518326|5.0|This is by far, hands down, the best book you can get to play the music of the Beatles.  For this price, you can't go wrong, it's literally a bible to the Beatles catalog.  It's all right there in one book, amazing.
B00006V9A0|4.0|This is a great album, but one song short from Nirvana's greatest hits. It is missing the song \\"where did you sleep last night\\" (a cover of leadbelly) from the unplugged performance.  It has many of nirvana radio hits. If you buy the foreign version of this cd, it will have the song, \\"where did you sleep last night. It also has a great unreleased song \\"You Know You're Right.\\" This cd is great for the hardcore nirvana fans or for people who want a taste of Nirvana's music. This songs on this cd volume is louder than the orginal albums.
1591840562|3.0|After reading the glowing reviews from the likes of Geoffrey Moore and Clayton Christensen I assumed that this book really had something to say to beginners as well as serial entrepreneurs.  If you've been down the entrepreneurship road before and you don't know 85% of the material in this book, you missed a lot the first time around.  Although I was reminded of a few points as I read the book, it was more of an Entrepreneurship 100 book.  The basic steps of starting out, bootstrapping, aligning actions with achievable and productive objectives and other points were valuable if a reader has not been there before.  Guy also writes as if his California/post-bubble-oriented view is The Way and readers need to take some of his pronouncements with a grain of salt (e.g., VCs are not going to want to know about the details of your business in the first meeting).  That aside, it's probably worth reading for new entrepreneurs who are starting out in a new business and have not read another of the many similar books that are out there.  For that, I gave it 3 stars.
0553275976|3.0|This formulaic novel is fast-moving (except for Chapter 15.) It also provides insights on human nature and the sociology of New York City, circa 1987.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the plot breaks down near the end, in Chapter 31. The riot scene in the courtroom seems unrealistic, as does Sherman McCoy's too sudden transformation from petrified Wall Street elite to a guy ready to take on everyone in the Bronx. <br />The story, which progresses steadily and surely through the first 30 chapters, comes to a too easily wrought end with the equivalent of a roaring car chase rather than by bringing all of the strands of the story together at trial.  <br /> <br />At the risk of seeming vain, and although still following the formulaic structure, I believe Wolfe would have been better served by the following outline for an ending: <br /> <br />The case goes to trial ... Kramer argues the State's case ...  Maria Ruskin testifies against McCoy ... Roland Auburn testifies against McCoy ... Killian plays the tapes ... Judge Kovitsky discovers that Killian and McCoy have tried to get a crucial tape of a conversation between Ruskin and McCoy into evidence despite knowing it was illegally made ... Peter Fallow makes headline news of all of this and Reverend Bacon states that vindication is at hand ... just when all seems lost for McCoy,  <br />Henry Lamb awakens from his coma, and being the honest, college-bound kid he is, testifies that Ruskin and Auburn lied about how he got hurt ... the rest of the newspapers and TV stations     <br />in NYC jump on this news, crucifying Fallow's reporting, Bacon's posturing, and Kramer's baseless prosecution ... now comes the verdict: not guilty ... Maria Ruskin is convicted of perjury and perhaps it looks like she'll lose her fortune gained from marrying the geriatric and now-deceased Arthur Ruskin ... Auburn is also convicted of perjury, his plea deal is cooked and he is sent to Rikers for all of his prior offenses ... Fallow is fired and finished in journalism: he returns to England to rot in his alcoholic stew ... Kramer keeps the job he so hated before taking on the McCoy case, never again the star in the D.A.'s office and with even less of a chance of getting a job like the high-paying kind in a Wall Street firm he so envies; Kramer's nascent affair isn't discovered, but the girl with brown lipstick won't have anything more to do with him ... McCoy no longer must fear being thrown into Rikers, but his marriage is destroyed; McCoy's ability to regain his former stature on Wall Street and look at life from the point-of-view of an American aristocrat is irreparably compromised; McCoy's 8-year-old daughter is really the only one who still believes in him just as much as in the days when he thought himself a Master of the Universe ... can there really be any winners after The Bonfire of the Vanities? <br /> <br />As it is, Wolfe's novel is surely more than passable entertainment, but misses the mark as one of the greatest novels of the 20th Century because of its formulaic structure and subpar ending.

I guess they don't realize \\"American Idiot\\" is about them and their followers. That's why they're idiots.
1573301051|1.0|I watched this when it first aired and needless to say I was disgusted. I was a fan of Gloria Estefan, Celine Dion and Mariah Carey and had hopes the three of them would be on a stage together. When it finally happened the results sickened me. My first complaint was that Mariah Carey added that hideous remix to her song My All that RUINS it.  <br /> <br />My second complaint was with the finale. Aretha Franklin, Celine Dion and Mariah Carey were trying to outscream each other while Gloria and Shania Twain were left in the dust. It was childish behavior by three grown women who should have known better.
B0002Z1EG2|2.0|I love Shania. I've seen her twice in concert. I listen to her all the time. She's one of my favorite artists. But I have to say she's releasing a greatest hits album way too early in her career. She only has 3 albums. I don't count her self titled as an album because it...well it sucked. I think money would be better spent buying the 3 albums that are featured on this greatest hits album than actually buying it. There are a few new songs. All of which are terrible. I'm sorry, but Shania can do much better. \\"I'm Having a Party\\" is a horrible song. I can't believe Shania and Mutt wrote that trash. That's even below Britney's standard. But all the old songs are solid gold. Buy the albums they came off of.
B000002HMH|5.0|people will tell you this is terrible just because its not master of puppets or ride the lightning. true, its not, but that doesnt mean its a terrible album just because it doesnt sound like their old stuff. assh*les who claim to be metallica fans will down them just because now alot more people like them because of black album and load. the truth is, if metallica had tried to redo master of puppets, it probly would have turned out pretty sad. metallica are a great band because they can play anything from thrash metal to heavy metal to hard rock, and sound great in it all. people hate this album because its metallica and they expect metallica to do everything to please their fans, but what they dont realize is, bands need to change, otherwise they slowly fade away and are never as great as they once were, and we're left with those few good albums. the only time i ever disagreed with metallica is st anger, which i wont go into now. anyway, its true this album isnt as good as master of puppets, but the one way in which it triumphs over puppets is in the lyrics. puppets contained many teen-angst deep thrash lyrics, which is fine. black album and load contain heartfelt, truly amazing lyrics, shown very well in songs such as until it sleeps and hero of the day. the beats are also spectacular, aint my bitch being the best rocker on the album. king nothing is another great song, cool tune in the chorus. mama said is probably the last song you would expect metallica to do, but they still pull it off as good as they possibly could have. songs i dislike are bleeding me, the outlaw torn, and thorn within. bottom line, if you like metallica, pick this album up because its great in its own way.
B00025ETIW|5.0|Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge is such an unbelievable cd.  It is   <br />amazing.  I love it. I'm usually into a lot harder stuff like dimmu Borgir and this cd is one of my favorite. There is nothing to say that is negative about it.  The only song i didnt rate 5 out of 5 was, The Jetset Life is Gonna Kill You.And even though it wasn't 5 out of 5, it was still 4's.  To wrap it up, this is definetly a buyer, and if you do get it (Which you should) you will not be unsatisfied.
B00005JMAH|3.0|The third installment in the Harry movies is by far the worst movie of them all. Alfonso Cuaron needs to be sacked.  Where did it all go? The Squid? Cho-Chang? I mean you have to make these movies as parallel to the books as possible and at that Alfonso Sucks! He's lucky I even gave him 3 stars for trying. If you are a fan of Harry Potter do not get this movie because you won't be a fan anymore and if you never liked Harry you'll hate Harry even more. If you are trying Harry Potter for the first time you will ask, \\"whats the big fuss about Harry?\\" Read the books instead I have nothing against them besides they are way better. Trust me.
0375760024|5.0|Who can say more about Sherlock Homes?  Except that he still remains one of the most fascinating characters in the annals of fiction (with the possible exception of \\"The Sea Wolf\\" by Jack London).  And his latest portrayer, Jeremy Brett, in the PBS series, is just dead-on.  He is a joy to watch after you've read the real thing.  Why Watson is as old as he is is a mystery, however, as in Doyle's stories he is quite a young man, being at most no more than thirty-five, and in most of the tales, married, and living apart from Holmes.  My book had 612 pages, and a page-turner til the last.  Especially great to read over the holidays when time is at a premium, and no story is very long.  Easy to pick up and put down.  The stories are not in the least dated, and if you think that, you are sorely mistaken.  A good mystery is a good mystery, in any century.  No serious reader should be without Holmes in his collection.
0440419514|5.0|After reading the reviews by Leigh A. Hubbard and Kim A. Johnson, I am DEFINITELY buying this book. Any book that promotes the idea that, \\"The worse thing you can ever do, the series implies, is to keep the truth from people.\\" and that can show the bankruptcy in religion sounds AWESOME. AND it's like Harry Potter??? Too good to be true!!!
1878574590|5.0|I don't mean to categorize Frank Miller's \\"Sin City\\" by saying it is \\"noir perfected,\\" but I feel that what this book does, it does perfectly.  It's a dark, gritty, intense drama about a crime through the eyes of a murderer who is not guilty of the murder he is accused of.  In real life, Marv, Goldie, Nancy, and the rest of Miller's \\"Sin City\\" cast would be the individuals most of us tend to stay away from.  They live in the grossest most beaten down parts of a town that is famed for its gross beaten down borroughs.  Yet, the cast of characters Miller assembles around Marv make his character, and more importantly this story, one of the most oddly likable in comics.   <br /> <br />Marv is not an antihero.  He's not a recluse like Spawn who is locked in some eternal denial of his reality yet constantly wants to change it.  Marv loves and accepts the fact that he lives outside the lines, 'caise afterall, doesn't somebody always?   <br /> <br />This late in the \\"Sin City\\" game, I can only guess that those of you who pick this up are interested because of the Robert Rodriguez film that comes out April 1, 2005.  For those of you, I highly recommend this book, because while the \\"Sin City\\" movie contains more \\"Sin City\\" story than this TPB alone, you can instantly realize how well adapted this movie will be when you read the first 20 pages and then watch the preview.  Rodriguez was wise to allow Miller to co-direct the \\"Sin City\\" film because it appears as though it will be the truest comic book film of all time.  If you think the movie looks intriguing, please read this book first because it'll not only give you a deeper idea on the character of Marv, but'll change the way a lot of you look at comics simply because of how Frank Miller works. <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|3.0|\\"uneven\\" would be the way to describe this album for me. i think this album has some inspired moments on it, as well as some insipid moments, at times even within the same song - re:\\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\". <br /> <br />this album probably won't make a lot of new fans. but if you're not familiar with U2 by this point, then i don't know where you've been living. <br /> <br />i'm a pretty big U2 fan, i think \\"All That You Leave Behind\\" was a really great album. this album was okay, but kinda leaves you wanting a little more.
0156027321|3.0|This book might as well have been published in two volumes: the religious awakening of the beginning, and the subsuquent survival at sea.  My problem with the book is that the two are essentially unconnnected.  Occasional refereneces to God and prayer were made during Pi's journey, but they were felt like an afterthought.  Personally, I felt nothing spiritual while reading the book.<br /><br />Having said that, the descriptive and visceral prose describing Pi's adventure is captivating.  It shows that abhorrent acts can become second nature to a person who is desperate.  I just don't think that this message, which has been done before, is important enough to garner the level of praise that this book has received.
B00063MBU8|1.0|This CD sucks so bad. This is the type of music that sixth and seventh grade girls listen to because \\"the lead singer is hot!\\". Simple Plan has no talent. They are 100% pop, you cannot even call this punk-pop. All of the songs sound the same, and they all sound like every other band out there. They started out as a \\"funny\\" band, and now that it is the \\"cool\\" thing to do to go all dark and moody as a band, they jump on the bandwagon and all of a sudden they're supposedly dark. And the song \\"Welcome to My Life\\" is the biggest load of bulldookie I have ever heard. They are all a bunch of rich snots who don't know how much they have, so they complain that they don't have enough. Kind of like Good Charlotte's song the \\"rich and the famous\\". Well, look who's rich and famous now. If you want real pop-punk then check out Bowling for Soup.
B000002J0B|5.0|The year was 1973. Led Zepellin finally spoke to me. And I wasn't even born yet. But, the time would come would I would be introduced to Led Zepellin's strongest album, \\"Houses of the Holy\\". I had bought Pink Floyd, The Doors, Boston, Jimi Hendrix, mostly just because classic rock was \\"cool.\\" not because i really loved it. This album stopped me from being a faker. I truly love it. Robert Plant's beautiful, hard melodies, Jimmy Page's insane guitar work. and some of the most soft and lovely songs this side of Nick Drake. This is not a rock album, it fits in the category of eclectic, most similar to the Ben Harpers of today. But, it is the pride of classic rock.
B0006IIKS0|5.0|Excellent Movie!!!  It'll make you laugh, it will make you cry... <br />Whether you are a metallica fan or not it will show you a side of the band that most didnt know up till now...
B00005K9LN|5.0|I agree with one particular reviewer before me that said Rob Halford has a more 'tough guy' vocal approach on this album than on most. To be honest with the rest of you, I can't really describe in words how good 'British Steel' is! 'Breaking The Law' has recently been used on a T.V commercial back here in Britain, to me, that shows how popular it STILL is here in the UK! <br />As my title says, THIS was my first Judas Priest album given to me as a Birthday gift, and it was the best thing I could've hoped to recieve!
1400032717|4.0|As many of the other reviews will indicate, this book is told from the perspective of a 15 year old autistic boy named Christopher.  Christoper is blamed for the murder of his neighbor's dog and he sets out to find the real killer. Thus the story begins... The readers learn about Christoper from his own perspective and they learn about his family.  The story is full of emotion.  The plot movement is a bit choppy but I am pretty sure that was intentional on the part of the author.  Overall this was an interesting read.  It's a good travel book in lieu of the inflight movie and if for nothing else it will at least educate you a bit about autism.
B000002KET|5.0|After hearing 'Killing Yourself To Live' on a personal compilation CD at a friends house once, I had thought to myself \\"Why haven't I heard THIS Sabbath record yet?\\" I mean I love Black Sabbath! I own five of their albums and love 'em all! Ozzy's vocals are great! I'm not sure if 'Fluff' really does deserve a place as I find it's a very boring track, but the rest of the album I've fallen in love with! I have no regrets purchasing this CD from the Kings of Heavy Metal. <br />Another one in the collection then!
0393035158|5.0|I found this book to be a very interesting.  Sam Harris makes some clearly thought out arguments for why religions that are fundamentalist and evangelical are dangerous. He makes a good argument for mysticism as an alternative to emotional fundamentalist religion. Thinking is an obstacle to meditation but irrational thinking is the root cause of emotional difficulties to include social emotions such as hatred, greed, envy and jealousy. I would recommend that readers look into Albert Ellis' work \\"Reason and Emotion in Psychotherapy\\". Here readers will  get a glimpse of how learning to think about one's own thinking by using Ellis' ABCD technique of thought identification can break automatic thinking.  As Harris rightly states learning to step back from thought/images in the first person is essential for moving toward a less automatic state of consciousness. Ellis' work teaches one how and can include meditation.  For another work addressing the importance of people having compassion and love as central to their consciousness I would recommend Maurice Nicoll's \\"Commentaries on Gurdieff and Ouspensky\\".  For a good description of how consciousness is rooted in biology I recommend A. Damasio's \\"The Feeling of What Happens\\" plus Gerald Edelman's \\"Bright Air, Brillant Fire\\" in addition to their works listed by Harris.
B00018D44U|5.0|If you read my review of Come Away with Me then you know I have a slight affection for Norah Jones. I ended with: she is not a one-hit wonder who will disappear into the sunset once the media frenzy dies down. You can expect to see more releases as she spreads her wings.<br /><br />Norah Jones has spread her wings with her second release, Feels Like Home. This whole CD has a different feel. It isn't the ballad symphony of the last album and it has less of a jazzy flair with a bit of country pop.<br /><br />Feels Like Home showcases 13 new songs, seven written or co-written by Norah Jones. Norah is accompanied by the Handsome Band: Lee Alexander (bass), Kevin Breit (guitar), Andrew Borger (drums), Adam Levy (guitar) and Daru Oda (background vocals, keyboards). There are also special guest appearances by Dolly Parton, Levon Helm and Garth Hudson. From the first album she brought back Jesse Harris, Tony Scherr, Brian Blade and Rob Burger.<br /><br />SUNRISE is the first single released off Feels Like Home. It is an upbeat number with a distinctive slit drum keeping rhythm in the back.<br /><br />A little blues is shared with IN THE MORNING but what is most notable about this number is the Wurlitzer piano solo before the last chorus.<br /><br />A little country flavour is served with CREEPIN' IN, a duet with Dolly Parton. I was surprised when I heard Dolly would accompany Norah but this isn't the first time. They performed together at the 2003 Country Music Awards. Parton doesn't overshadow Jones like I thought she might. Compared to her regular performances Dolly is toned down for this song. Even her endearing signature laugh at the end of the track was toned down. You can't help but smile when you hear Dolly laugh. She has a contagious glow about her. They complement one another in this upbeat bluegrass performance. This isn't the only country sounding number THE LONG WAY HOME, also carries a bit of twang albeit more subtle.<br /><br />Two of my favourite songs are TOES and HUMBLE ME both reminiscent of Norah's love of ballads. HUMBLE ME is very simple with Norah on vocals and pump organ accompanied by guitar and bass.<br /><br />DON\\"T MISS YOU AT ALL was written by Norah a couple years ago to Duke Ellington's instrumental \\"Melancholia\\". She has actually been performing it in concerts long before it reached this CD and is a beautiful ending. Like her first album, Norah ends with just her vocals and piano. Sweet.<br /><br />My only complaint about this CD is the new Copy Control Technology the record label decided to incorporate. While I can understand where they are coming from, I don't appreciate not being able to play my CD on any player. It took a couple plays before my player finally stopped skipping. Annoyed is something you don't want to be when listening to an album for the first time. So be warned, you may have issues playing the CD and may have to try a couple of players to get it to play through without skipping.<br /><br />I love every song on this CD. If you are a Norah Jones fan I don't think you will be disappointed and if Norah is new to you, I think you will be delighted.<br /><br />Review Originally Posted at [...]urite songs are TOES and HUMBLE ME both reminiscent of Norah's love of ballads.

Of course it remains ranked higher than most other music, but it has since slipped in my personal ranking of Frusciante's catalog.  This may sound odd, but, overall, the songs on SCWP that aren't completely weirded out are some of JF's most normal-sounding songs.  (Please note that I say MOST.)  What I mean is they sound the like they could almost fit in with other decent alt-rock music.  But the weird ones...MAN.  Those without lyrics are mainly the crazy(est) tracks.  The intro to \\"Carvel,\\" \\"-00Ghost27\\" (the exact title), \\"Failure33Object,\\" and \\"23 go in to end\\" are specifically what I refer to.  Also, for some reason, the songs on SCWP always seem to get stuck in my head, especially \\"Wednesday's Song\\" and \\"Water\\" and ...heck, all of them!  The more I think about it, the more I remember that JF's \\"older\\" music is just as good as his new stuff, and I need to take a break from the more recent Record Collection recordings and revisit the old.  (FYI: Even though it was released this year in late spring, John has released 5 CD's since on this \\"6 Albums in 6 Months\\" thing.)  This is a good JF disc for diehards and beginners alike.
0385302320|5.0|This was her best book ever. Outlander comes in second. This was the best set I have ever read in my 46 years of life! This is NOT A ROMANCE NOVEL! It's often mistaken for one, possibly cause of the cover art. It is as good or better than any Ken Follet or Robert Ludlum novel. The action, the blood and guts, the adventure is an adrenaline rush and everyone I've passed the book on to also thinks so. It's been 10 years since I've read her first two books and there's not a week that goes by that I don't think about it. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.
B00065U08Q|5.0|I have loved Frusciante's solo work since the days of To Record Only Water for Ten Days, and A Sphere In The Heart Of Silence is no different in regards to ...my regard for Frusciante's music.  But I like techno.  If you don't like heavily synthesized music, much of JF's work is not for you, and that especially applies to ASITHOS.  If you don't like synth, try Frusciante's Inside of Emptiness.  Heck, if you DO like synth try Inside of Emptiness.  I would argue it is his best yet.  But...yeah, ASITHOS is spacey and strange, and has some songs that you can really feel.  I particularly like track 6, Surrogate People, but I'm a freak for weird stuff!
0765309408|5.0|As has been mentioned already, the similarities to the masterworks of Heinlein and to Haldeman's Forever War are vividly present, and in a good way.  But there's more.  Unfortunately, and as a devout Heinlein fan it pains me to say this, I actually think Scalzi does it better.  His gracefully engaging first-person style so completely bonds the reader to the main character that it's quite possible that we would enjoy reading about them just going shopping at a grocery store.  The depth and realism of his main character is what you might expect from literature of the highest calibre, the likes of which is quite uncommon in science fiction. <br /> <br />It's a compelling read, with action and philosophical contemplations worthy of Haldeman and Heinlein, but also with a simple, stirring humanity that's all Scalzi.
B00005JMJG|4.0|Eternal Sunshine is a great movie.  I don't understand the people that are giving it one star, and passing it off as incoherent and boring.  I'm sorry Eternal Sunshine doesn't have the usual Hollywood blockbuster formula, and it's not starring your typical bottle blonde and muscular freak of nature. <br /> <br /> <br />Anyway, I went to pick up the DVD at Best Buy and they were out, but what I found odd was that it was in the Comedy section.  I'm not saying it's not funny, because it has it's great moments, but I think the movie is more of a drama.  It's heartfelt and it expresses to what extent someone will go to for love. <br /> <br />The story is set in Long Island with Clementine (Winslet) and Joel (Jim) meeting on the train, an extremely quirky relationship then blossoms.  Joel and Clementine's relationship isn't perfect, but what relationship is?  They argue and fight, with one or the other getting blamed for being overdramatic or having no feelings.   <br /> <br />Joel then finds out that Clementine has had every single memory of him erased from her mind.  He decides to do the same, and while he's receiving the treatment he realizes how much he really does love her despite the differences they have had.   <br /> <br />The movie is very fast paced from then on, and it just goes to show what lengths some people will go to for love, whether it be trying to get over the pain of a breakup, or trying to keep the love alive. <br /> <br /> <br />So ignore all the one star voters and keep in mind that if someone thinks that a movie doesn't make sense, they're most likely not intelligent enough to grasp ideas that aren't spoon fed to them.

B0000AQS6R|5.0|This movie is a classic.  I have watched Christmas Vacation every year for as long as I can remember.  Chevy Chase and the rest of the cast give a hilarious performance that makes this the best movie in the Vacation series.  Everyone can relate to this movie in some capacity as it shows the story of the Griswold Family Christmas.  You might even start to compare some of your own relatives and neighbors to members of the Griswold family.  This film is a must have for every holiday season.
B00004Z459|5.0|Considering that this is Linkin Park's debut album, it is excellent. There is an amazing amount of maturity in the lyrics and the instrumentals are incredible. However, their second album, Meteora, is ten times better (that's saying something!). So for those who have not heard Linkin Park; first, what is wrong with you, second, buy this album first. I only say this because this album is very good by itself, and when you become a diehard LP fan, Meteora will seem like a godly album, which it is. And if you think that this album is terrible, you must have very bad hearing, earwax buildup, or a CD player with Whitney Houston in it in your ears. LP ROCKS!
B000001FI7|4.0|This is a great trip-hop CD by english group \\"Portishead\\" (named after thier home town)\\".<br /><br />This CD has some very odvious classics such as 'Roads',  and my favourite song of all time, and the third single to come of the album 'Glory Box' - the first and second being 'Numb' and 'Sour Times' respectively. Whilest 'It Could Be Sweet' and 'Wandering Star' are a bit bland, most of these songs offer trip-hop at it's best with good beats and Beth Gibbons' angelic vocals.<br /><br />88%
B00005JKES|3.0|This series was made for DVD-- but for God's sake stop releasing it in dribs and drabs. <br /> <br />The entire Twin Peaks series has been available on the Gnutella network for years, and if they want us to pay for it, they need to finally make the whole show available, preferably in one boxed set with a lot of extras, for around 60-80 dollars.   <br /> <br />Do these guys REALLY expect me to spend good money to watch Twin Peaks up to the point where Agent Cooper is mysteriously shot by an unknown hand, with Laura's killer yet to be discovered... with no more episodes available?  Get a clue.
B000084T18|5.0|I know everybody hates 50 and saying he can't rhyme and stuff 'cuz Ja Rule doesn't like him at all. y'know he's been having a hard time with his relationship with 50. But those that didn't believe him or whateva, you shouldn't have not been a fan or you would've got into some Prime Minister, B.B. Jay or Lil' Raskull or T-Bone which I'm into right now which talks about rapping for the Lord and everything.    The difference about 50 is that he isn't afraid to show his face or whateva 'cause he can rap about anything he believes on his songs. Problem is I don't have no hate on 50 but I have faith in him just as long as I pray that he'll keep his spirits up to God and move on with his life and stuff.     Lemme get this down, we know that he's been shot 9 times, and why he was dropped from his 1st and former label Columbia Records. I haven't bought his 1st album which entitles Power of the Dollar EP maybe 'cuz it'll be interesting to check out.  Like I said there's no need of being criticized or judge by 50. I love him. I respect him. I have trust and beliefs in him. And let him go on with his life.    I look forward of trying out his new movie, his memoir, his upcoming album he's 'bout 2 drop out next year 'cuz the song that's playing on the radio now is \\"Disco Inferno\\" . Y'know that is really bangin, knahmsayin. Ya'll should pray and wait until he have 'nother album on the way pretty soon. 'cuz make sure it is more Christian enuff or mainstream enuff like Kanye's and Mase's.    Long period short, like to say I love the entire album but there were a few songs I dislike or the other which I'm not feelin'at this moment but every song I picked which is crazy or off da chain or whateva is makin me going to pick this album or else just listen to if 4 a minute.    Yeah 50 is my inspiration to follow w/ 2Pac, Biggie and Eminem.
0393035158|5.0|Sam Harris argues that religious faith is at the root of most of what is currently wrong with the world.  He's got a point - if someone suggested that Zippy the Pinhead's ineffable and oblique sayings constituted a canon of revealed truth, that person would be thought odd, and perhaps institutionalized.  However, accepting as revealed truth the multitranslated (and often poorly translated) writings of ancient middle eastern desert tribes (or eastern mystics, or what-have-you) is generally viewed with a certain amount of approbation.  If we fight over what we can't prove, we're going to exterminate ourselves as a species.   <br /> <br />The fly in the ointment in Harris' argument, at the end of the book, is his focus on meditative techniques and consequent selflessness as a means to circumvent the dangers inherent in true belief and overinvestment in untestable ideas.  While an interesting postulate, it fails to persuade.  Why? Ultimately, the end of [religious] faith must be accompanied by education to enable people to reason the world for themselves and make sense of its ambiguity.  Harris' argument suggests that it is possible to relyon altered states of consciousness as a means.  Certainly, he's right - in SOME cases.  Altered consciousness through mediation may well work as a means for some people.  For others, merely opening their eyes and seeing the world as it is may evidence understandings of causality and the rigor of evidence.   To say otherwise is casuistry.  <br /> <br />In spite of its flaws, the book could not have arrived at a better time.  We live in a world full of religious zealots - Christian, Islamic, Hindu, who knows what else.  All of them believe they subscribe to the one true creed and that all other creeds and belief systems are false.  And none of them can offer a shred of testable evidence to validate their belief that unseen deity (or deities) smile on their beliefs more than others.  It's like a bad recipe - take a variety of religious zealots, mix together, add WMD, and see if the dish survives... <br /> <br />Thank you for taking the time to read this review.
B000002LJA|5.0|BACK ON THE BLOCK (1989) is one the best albums that Quincy Jones put out in the late '80s. It shows a new direction in the black culture and black music we're talking 'bout right now. <br /> <br />I think everybody should own this CD even tho it's out-of-print cuz you can go online and get it like spun.com, djangos.com, wherehouse.com, cduniverse.com or gemm.com (where I go where they have all the LPs, cassettes, books, CDs, all of that used and never owned before). <br /> <br />Yeah Quincy put out an album that is so amazing and it still lives from this day forward. This CD has everyone craving about- Jazz, R&B, Funk, Jazz-Rock, Fusion, Rap, Hip-Hop, Soul, Pop, etc.- It's full of a variety of different artists from Barry White (whom I recently loved and lost from last year), Ray Charles (we all know who passed this year but still lives on), Ella Fitzgerald, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, James Ingram, Tevin Campbell, Ice-T, Big Daddy Kane, Chaka Kahn, Patti Austin of course, The Seawind Horns feat. Jerry Hey and all of 'em, y'know all of the above you can name. <br /> <br />I love this man to death even tho he puts out real stuff like the artists we listen too right is Alicia Keys, Musiq, Mary J. Blige, Grover Washington, Jr., Miles Davis, George Benson, Usher, Brian McKnight, Boyz II Men (two of my favorite R&B gurus of all-time), OutKast, Nelly, Steely Dan, Barry White, Marvin Gaye, Kirk Franklin, Donnie McClurkin, Fred Hammond, Yolonda Adams, Mase, LL Cool J, Common, The Roots, Guru & Gang Starr, etc. <br /> <br />This is a must-have. Also check out Q's Jook Joint too 'cuz it's a classic.
B000069HK2|5.0|This CD is a really good CD in my opinion. It has some really cool songs on it with alot of feeling in them e.g. \\"Noise and Kisses\\" and \\"The taste of Ink\\". I would reccomend this CD to anyone who is into hard rock or emo or whatever. <br /> <br />To P. Haukas, fair enough if you have your opinion about the CD but I found your review offensive (it seemed like a stab at mormons) and I have reported it to amazon so hopefully people wont have to read your crap on here anymore.
B0002OERI0|5.0|this cd is great!!!!  i didnt think this would be 5 stars but it is    favorite songs:  -American idiot  -jesus of surburbia  -Holiday  -Boulivard of Brokan Dreams  -And all the songs on this album    if u dont have it buy this immedietly  this is my 1st green day album and it is terrific!!
B00005MP58|5.0|Everyone knows the plot - so I won't go over that again. But I must write about how ardently I admire and love the BBC/A&E production.    The key for any production of P&P is that the reader (or in this case, the viewer) should fall in love with Elizabeth within minutes, otherwise it will never work. She's a fabulous character - smart, witty, a good friend and sister, aware of her limitations (well, at least her musical ones), and confident enough to challenge the deserving Mr. Darcy. Jennifer Ehle is a perfect Elizabeth. And Colin Firth as Darcy - oh........ Loved him! Excellent supporting cast as well, especially Allison Steadman as a hilarious Mrs. Bennet and whoever played Catherine De Bourgh (her scene with Elizabeth in the garden is a highlight), and wonderful production design.     Watching P&P also demonstrates that the only way to do Austen justice is by adapting her novels into miniseries. Nothing is left out, and we can get to know and love the characters - or not love them, depending on what they deserve!     P&P should be required reading for everyone (especially romance writers!), and the miniseries should be required viewing for everyone. It's a joy.    Also Recommended: Sense and Sensibility, though it's not as good; and P&P the novel.
B00008L3U1|3.0|Don't expect a classic when you see this, because if you expect that then you're not going to like it, the movie is okay. It's just a heartwarming story that is more for the family then anything else, good though, Robin Williams displays good acting here.
B00005JMAH|2.0|Alfonso Cuaron has made a drab and disappointing film. Here is a classic example of a director mucking up a perfectly fine story. While of course it isn't possible to put every nuance of these books onscreen, Chris Columbus did a fine job with the first two. In this one, Cuaron reshuffled the Hogwarts grounds layout for no reason, ignored most of the secondary storylines even when they were extremely important to the story as a whole, failed to develop the new characters, and apparently told the actors to walk through their parts. After the first two wonderful Harry Potter movies, this was a big let-down.
B00005JM0B|5.0|I was really expecting something stupid when i went to theaters for this, well its been over a decade since 2, you kind of get that feeling it is going to suck. I was surprised, the beginning is a little sick with the male stripper but everything runs smoothly, the action does seem over the top at times, but hey, it's Terminator. Pretty Lengthy too, some scenes are really not needed but the movie still does well either way. I have to say, for a franchise that hasn't been around for a decade, it is pretty damn good.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|And as a doctor, there's not a lot I can guarantee in general.     But this...oh I envy you if you have not seen this yet. I most certainly envy your upcoming joyous movie-going moment of discovery.    If this movie is not a five star film, then none are.    There are so many perfect things about \\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\\"...so many things the filmmakers got absolutely right...that not only is it the best cinematic telling of the Robin Hood legend, it's one of the best cinematic tellings of anything.    Errol Flynn inhabits this role such that you're sure this is what Robin Hood must have really been like...you don't even bother with the question of whether or not he really did exist. Of course he did, and he looked and spoke and fought just like Errol Flynn.    Claude Rains, as the oily Prince John and Basil Rathbone, as the principal nemesis Guy of Gisbourne, are sheer perfection as well. Every line delivery, arched eyebrow...they have the parts nailed.    The Band of Merry Men are terrific as well. You will instantly become fond of Much, Little John, Friar Tuck...only Will Scarlett seems to be an add-on.    Olivia deHavilland is something to behold as Maid Marian. She's initially repulsed by Robin, yet as we all know will fall in love with him by the end. Just using her eyes, she tells her side of the story...she doesn't even need to read her lines.     The direction is brisk, the screenplay literate, the banter witty and the plot has nice surprises sprinkled throughout. Two things stand out above all.  One: The lush cinematography to this day is an example of how colorful film can be.  To this day. It was made in 1938, but it looks gorgeous.  Two: Korngold's justly lauded score. It's the model for pretty much every epic action adventure filmed since. It's never intrusive, but from beginning to end it feels as if it's of a piece....a whole...it's not \\"just\\" a soundtrack.    Now let's get to the DVD. Again, it's perfect. The transfer sparkles.  The extras arealmost overwhelming, and to be honest, I haven't made it through them all yet. There are great documentaries on the film, on Technicolor itself...home movies, Korngold's score on an isolated track, a nice commentary bu Rudy Behlmer (who hosts most of the extras) and that neat \\"night at the movies\\" feature where you can recreate the moviegoing experience of 1938 by watching a trailer, a newsreel, a a short and a cartoon all before the main feature.    I purchased this as part of Warner Legends box set, and if this is any indicator, I'm in for many long, delightful hours of entertainment this new year.
B00005221M|5.0|I've always loved this movie, despite its errors, and I actually like it more since it doesn't follow the book.  I've always been a huge fan of 19th Century American writers and their works, but I really didn't enjoy the book \\"Last of the Mohicans\\".  I had seen some of the making-of documentaries about this movie and saw some scenes that didn't make it into the movie, so when they were re-edited in I certainly was thrilled with that.  I also appreciated the removal of the dialogue that was clearly 20th Century and wouldn't have fit in back then.  I'm not saying that this film is history (or even the book, for that matter), but as a serious student of that time period, my stomach turned more at some of the discourses between the characters than the historical errors. <br />All in all I liked the re-cut version better than the original, and they are both better than the book, but I suppose any number of items are up for personal subjectivity.
0684847817|5.0|I paid the original $30 for this at a book store and have NEVER regretted it. If you're an in depth Froud fan,or just a kid that likes fairies,this book is guaranteed to absolutely amaze you. It has wonderful descriptions of each creature and the most beautiful drawings ever,it's a really cool coffee table book too.
B00005JLRT|2.0|Well, the \\"even\\" numbered grace finally failed. First Contact is exciting, warm, humorous, and best of all, captured Rodenberry's vision of the future with near perfection. And while it had action, it was a Star Trek production, not just some action film. This one is not only is bereft of any kind of meaningful plot, but after the big action \\"highlight\\" - crashing ships in space, we then have Data needlessly killing himself (did they not recall those transporter bracelets from the TNG series? \\"Timescapes\\" was the episode, in case they wish to wiggle out of this one in any number of ways. I suggest that we have Data accidentally activate his dream program in the Holodeck, and thereby account for this mess, as he walks out shaken. After all, even he would bore himself to sleep with the plot!) Seriously, to end the Trek future with a deliberate and quite unecessary suicide would be absolutely anathema to Gene Roddenberry and all for which he stood. Suicide is never a \\"sacrifice\\" (especially when there are alternatives), and knowing that action films appeal to teen boys, is irresponsible in a way that Star Trek would never be. So it's just not a Star Trek film; it's someone's dull fantasy. And it is cruel to those fans who have adored \\"Data\\" for all the years. It is simply out of character for him to have resolved the situation this way, because Data's kind heart (which he ALWAYS had - this was always the in-joke that only he did not get) would never cause such pain to his friends, his family when all he had to do was grab a transporter bracelet (or similar device), set a phaser on overload, and return. I know, the actor was getting antsy, and hates the make-up, but minds can always be changed (as Nimoy knows) even in the worst of plot errors. The TNG characters are all too superb to just vanish in this distressing and violent way.<br /><br />Let's face it: the only way for the TNG cast to make an exit is to bring back Q (and maybe a few others), have some fun, and leave the future to the audience's imagination. I would venture that they go to a cable mini-series for a proper send-off -thereby avoiding the \\"odd-number jinx,\\" and have a reunion of many dear characters. Is this not the time, when science fact and fiction are blurring at a blinding rate? And I am sure that with Frakes or even Nimoy himself directing -- either would do, the Trek family can move on to the future with heads held high and with Data's future still a wonderful stew of endless possibility. (And aw heck, if it's that important to the actor, we can have Dr. Crusher improve his skin color and free Spiner of that dread make-up!) Oh, and remember from the series, he does have an appearance aging program - that was the episode with his \\"mom.\\" Heck, Patrick Stewart seems ready for some sort of sequel, and Spiner himself clearly is realizing what a bad idea this was, and well, it's time.<br /><br />All the best to the future, real and imagined,<br /><br />RM<br />P.S. -- UPDATE: AFTER THE JJ REBOOTS. I gave Nemesis an extra star! Now, it has two. Because it may be a bad Star Trek film, but it was a Star Trek film, unlike the recent faux-Trek fantasy-action films.
6305537321|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  I've seen it about 5 times.  The story is pretty simple.  I didn't know that this movie deviated so far from the book, so my next step is checking out the book. <br /> <br />I can see where those calling the movie simple and dated are coming from.  B/c it really is.  But on the good side, at least a remake wouldn't work. I practically loathe remakes.  There's no way that this story can really be \\"updated\\" without turning it into a Hollywood yuckfest. <br /> <br />All in all, check it out. Worth several viewings.  But read the book also.
6305127638|4.0|I have come to expect, after a bunch of great Trek double DVD's with awesome features and bonus material and Okuda's hilarious and respectful commentary (and a million other both entertaining and educational pieces), to see perhaps the greatest Trek film of all with all the great features. I realize there is no need for a director's cut since the film really is perfect as is, but I would like to see how Frakes worked in putting it together - this movie has several threads, woven together with the skill of a master and the love of the Star Trek dream. (And anyone who is tired of Data's search for humanity can just watch the Kirk crew forever, without a thought to what Rodenberry wanted: a increasingly brighter future wrought from the struggle and suffering of our beloved characters. Kirk struggled to his proper end admirably, and with significant fan input.) They are taking too long between films, which suggests that perhaps film itself is the wrong venue for the TNG crew to continue into the 21st century. This one may be the last of that type to really work because the next two just didn't cut it and the \\"last\\" one was not even in the Trek spirit and actually ended with a suicide! Ugh! I would suggest an HBO mini-series (or several-part \\"film\\") for the smaller screen since the small screen are getting bigger and better and concessions do not have to be made for young teens (unless they, too, are true trekkers, who want a good production such as this). The \\"action\\" in \\"First Contact\\" makes sense, and does not draw attention to itself, but simply works to make a better picture. I agree, maybe these actors do not want to get so old that they \\"outlive their usefulness\\" and perhaps \\"First Contact\\" might be a great send-off itself, but since it was not, we need first, a good, goodie-filled double-DVD of \\"First Contact\\" packed with extras, and then a grand finale worthy of Rodenberry's vision (as is \\"First Contact,\\" of course).<br /><br />Once this is released with two full DVD's packed with bonus goodies, it gets five stars!<br /><br />All the best to the future!<br /><br />RM
B00006CXXU|5.0|I have every Christina Aguilera cd in english and spanish, and this is her best cd yet.  Never has she had so many good songs with great beats, and she has learned how to control her voice so that she isn't belting every single note of every single song.  She has matured so much since her first album and I can't wait to see how she's going to top this album.
B00000JR29|5.0|Artistically and commercially brilliant. An album for my all-time Top Ten, including ALL artists and ALL genres of music. Over the last 25 years, few artists with substantial emotional depth and intelligence have managed to achieve mainstream international success. Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith did just that with \\"Songs From The Big Chair\\".<br /><br />From the cathartic chant of heavy opener \\"Shout\\" (still great for leaping around to at home!), to the ridiculously catchy massive hit \\"Everybody Wants To Rule The World\\", to the jazz crooning of \\"I Believe\\", every track has quality and substance. The standard of musicianship is exceptional, and a wide range of styles are embraced. Raw emotional power, lyrics that dig deep into psychological suffering but which are still somehow uplifting (even if it's not always clear what they are actually about), and great tunes. The sheer craftmanship shines throughout.<br /><br />Tears For Fears made some excellent music both before and after this album, but it was with this one that all the ingredients really came together as a whole. Masterful. Thank you Roland and Curt.
B00005JN0T|2.0|Let me put it plainly: this movie gave as much of a hard time as Swordfish and A.I. combined, two of my least favorite movies in recent times. It feels like a waste of a good story and some great acting (Will Smith's) on a poor screenplay where the effects are (sometimes) the only interesting thing in the movie (the reason I don't give it 1 star only). Never mind the product placement which becomes fairly annoying after a few minutes... The movie goes into unbelievable mode far too quick, plus it has a tough time retaining your attention.<br /><br />For the record, I am not an outright critic of SciFi. I am a fan of the genre, but movies such as Bladerunner and more recently, Minority Report, really do it justice. And I LOVED Alex Proyas' work with \\"The Crow\\" and \\"Dark City\\", but \\"I, Robot\\" instead felt more like \\"Oops, Robot\\". Do yourself a favor and skip it altogether.
0446530891|5.0|A great set of fresh new characters! I am eagerly awaiting the release of the Hour Game. Once again Baldacci rivets you into the plot from start to finish. Sean King and Michelle Maxwell are likeable and complex. I have not yet read a Baldacci novel that I didn't like. This was no exception.
B00006M183|5.0|Anyone who turns on their radio in this century and thinks music stinks, should pick up this PJ album. Pearl Jam Rocks, as always, as they pay tribute to the nine people who died at a Pearl Jam concert. This album is a somber, yet AWESOME pearl jam that everyone should own and listen to! Love Boat Captain, Thumbing My Way, and All or None are just a few to name that scream that YES Pearl Jam is still out there and Rockin! Some of these songs will bring a tear to your eye. A+ <br /> <br /> <br />Buy it, You won't regret it, I promise!
B00023B1A8|5.0|I'VE SEEN MANY C,S & N PERFORMANCES, BUT THIS IS THE BEST, THEY DON'T NEED A BIG PARAFRENALLIA, JUST THEIR VOICES, CROSBY AND NASH SOUND LIKE ANGELS, AND STEPHEN'S GUITAR ROARS LIKE A WILD LION. <br />THIS GUYS ARE REALLY AMAZING, THE BEAUTIFUL HARMONIES SHOW THAT TIME IS NOT AN ENEMY,AND THE EXPERIENCE'S NOT AN ACCIDENT. <br />ALTOUGH THE CONCERT IS NOT COMPLETELLY ACOUSTIC,IT'S A REAL DREAM CAME TRUE TO HEAR THEM SINGIN' WITHOUT A BACKUP BAND AND I THINK THAT IS THE BEST WAY TO ENJOY THEIR TALENTS.
0800141660|5.0|I must admit, being a forty-two year old man, I love to watch football and basketball as much as the next guy. But, when my wife watches this movie, I am right there beside her. Thompson, Rickman and Grant are meant to act with each other. They are brilliant and this story is perfect for them. If you have the opportunity to watch or even buy this movie, you will not be disappointed. The only thing missing is Kenneth Branagh. <br />I also recommend \\"Much ado about nothing\\" with Thompson and Branagh.
B000005ALN|5.0|George Michael has always been a rather deep singer, emotional wise anyway. His lyrics all have a bit of something personal added to them and he makes his mark as an artist intead of a simple superstar. \\"Older\\" could be hailed as his best ballad work to date. \\"Jesus to A Child\\" is one of the saddest, yet at the same time, uplifting songs I've ever heard and his soft vocal treatment only adds to this particular songs sweet allure. The rest of this album is done up in the same fashion, including the upbeat numbers which are always pleasant to hear. I personally like the message of the anti-monogomous spreading disease with \\"Spinning Wheel\\" which is accampanied by lush, brazilian sounding percussion. All in all, Older is my favorite album he has done and I hope he sticks to this formula. As he gets older, hopefully, his style will do the same with grace.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Simply put, Napoleon Dynamite is a very odd movie.  A conventional plot involving a student election and a prom sub-plot, never really materialize in a decent climax (albeit, the wedding scene could be construed as such, though it does not even appear until after the movie credits).  But this misgiving in some measure is balanced by the bizarre performances, for Napoleon and his cronies are quite remarkable and memorable.  Napoleon is a character who appears to be in a perpetual state of angst and/or oblivion, and is very hilarious in his own right (not to mention the stoned expression on his face which he wears throughout the whole movie). At times Napoleon Dynamite feels like it was made in the late seventies or early eighties, there is a definite retro quality to it that is difficult to articulate.  One should take heed, however, if one is bored by the film after half an hour of viewing it.  The pace remains very slow, and character development is basically established and finalized within the first quarter or so.  But the comedic elements are very curious and subtle, and, at times, unrelenting which makes for Napoleon Dynamite's unique stature as a film that effectively synthesizes drama and irony.
B00030590I|5.0|I saw only the american dvd version of this movie.  I'm interested in finding an import version, based on some reviews here which say the quality there is superior, but this review doesnt include those.  I thought the cinematography was beautiful.  i also may have a new favorite movie director.  this fact is noted in other reviews, but i'd like to clarify that the visual beauty is in no way gratuitous, but is integral to shape of the movie, much like in the movie Amelie, and a few other foreign films.  the way all the seperate elements in this movie were so meaningful to the shape of the whole is most impressive, and is seen in an american movie maybe once a decade.    the storyline, being the attempt on the first chinese emperor's life, is based in history, and there are in fact many chinese movies that deal with this.  however, the story is not (of course) to be taken literally, but is a vehicle for the authors inquiry into what constitutes nobility, what is the essence of virtue, what is loyalty, and the truly difficult and complex task of determining where your loyalty ultimately lies.  There's an interview with Jet Li on the dvd in which he states that he's been waiting for a roll like this for a very long time.  All the main characters are heroes in a sense, and the director lets none of them off the hook in the decisions they must make.  this is not remotely similar to the american definition of hero, which is basically just a \\"good\\" guy who kills all the \\"bad\\" guys and gets to fornicate with a invariably beautiful damsel in distress along the way a la the american version of a \\"love\\" story.  this is relatively heavy moral stuff.  luckily, due to the skill of all those involved in making this movie, it is not a burden, but a joy to watch.  once it starts, you wont be able to turn away from the screen.    there is some action, (the most visually stunning scenes by far,) but it is neither gratuitous nor overly abundant.  it resides in the mythical realm of spirit and dream, and deepens the impact of the whole movie.  if you want a whole package experience, i definitely recommend this.  if you want to watch an ultra-cool, ultra-macho comic book hero (minus the depth of character present in a comic book,) mindlessly slash nameless villians to a meaningless dance track, while single-handedly keeping the leather industry in buisness, watch a Blade mov
0783222475|4.0|Brief outline of plot: USGS finds evidence that a volcano in Washington State might be about to wake up, so sends in 007 (whoops, sorry, volcanologist Harry Dalton played by Pierce Brosnan) to investigate. He finds a nice little town and heightened activity in the form of gas emissions and acidity in the freshwater lake: also a couple of parboiled bodies in a hot spring. On the strength of this he predicts an imminent major eruption. He also starts to fall in love with the interesting lady mayor (single mum, successful cafe owner), and she with him. His boss arrives, calms things down, takes some more readings and concludes there won't be an eruption, at least not immediately. Boss is about to leave when Harry D notices something funny in the water (sulphur!), an observation which unfortunately interrupts a promising stayover with the mayor. So it's a true bill after all. Volcano erupts using quite gripping special effects, Harry D shepherds new love and her family through the ensuing chaos, finally ending up sheltering from a pyroclastic flow of Armageddon proportions (the best of the special effects and very thrilling) in a disused mine. Harry and family rescued so all ends happily ever after (at least for them, though one wonders about the rest of the inhabitants...) <br />     Contrary to many reviewers, I find the relationship between Hugh Dalton (Pierce Brosnan) and Mayor Wando (Linda Hamilton) to be the most interesting thing about this film - it's almost a shame the volcano interrupts them. Interesting because the characters come across as natural and everyday (despite the male lead's glamorous occupation): if you watch  you might come away thinking that, well, 'romance could happen to me just like this', even if not under these precise circumstances of course. The children are good also, as is the slightly tiresome mother-in-law: you get the real feel of a decent, ordinary family sustained by a hardworking breadwinner. (As the mayor says in reply to Dalton's wondering if she ever relaxes: 'Fun. What's that, fun? Oh, I know, it's when you don't have a business, a town and a family to run...'). I find it wholesome in the best (ie not holier-than-thou, priggish or preachy) sense of that word. As for the special effects, they are good and do get the pulse racing: however having seen a number of real volcanoes(albeit not erupting on this scale!), I find that even good special effects pale beside witnessing the real thing. So I find I tend to note them and then pass on to other things in the film.  <br />       I give 'Dante's Peak' 4 stars rather than 5 partly because I think there are missed opportunities and partly because some of it is rather implausible. I think it highly unlikely that anyone could predict an eruption with confidence having made the number of observations 'Harry Dalton' did early on in the film. Some reviewers found Harry's boss curmudgeonly: I think myself he was being very properly cautious when you consider the amount of harm a false alarm can cause. Also, the timescale building up to a major catastrophe is usually far longer than the fortnight or so allowed by 'Dante's Peak'. Mount St Helens for instance woke up in March 1980 with the cataclysm not coming till May. Krakatau (1883) woke up in May and exploded at the end of August, about nine weeks later. Finally, could not more have been made of the potential rivalry between the business investor (Elliot Blair of 'Blair Industries') and the volcanologist for the hand of the feisty lady mayor? Blair was clearly interested in her, and a conflict between him and the relatively impecunious but more glamorous volcanologist might have made for a lot more interest. I also don't think a truck (even 4WD) could have survived that long on top of semi-molten lava at probably 900+ or even 1100 Centigrade - he might just have got away with it if he'd not stalled, but not otherwise: his fuel tank would surely have blown up! <br />      It's not profound or art-house cinema (grounds on which some of my acquaintances would criticise it), but then it doesn't pretend to be. If you want some pleasant relaxation including a highly plausible love story and spectacular special effects then buy this film, and give it a go after a hard day at the workplace.

Mark Haddon's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is a story of discovery and a brillant look into the mind of an autistic child.  <br /> <br />Late one night, while wandering through the streets of his neighborhood, Christopher stumbles across the dead carcass of his neighbor's dog, Wellington. Christopher becomes determined to find Wellington's murderer. He instead stumbles across a much bigger mystery. It appears his mother isn't dead at all. In fact, she's living in London. Now, Christopher must find her. <br /> <br />Haddon does a brillant job bringing Christopher to life. By writing the novel as though the fact obsessed Christopher is writing it, Haddon captures Christopher's soul and view of the world. Short chapters are devoted to various anecdotes that don't necessarily explain the plot but allow glimpses into Christopher's structured life. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time ius a wonderfully moving, yet improbable story that touches the heart.
0064407667|5.0|This series is really high on my list. It's almost even with Harry Potter(that's saying something). In the first book of the series, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny find out that their parents have died in a very mystereous fire that desroyed their home and everything in it. If that's not enough to ruin someone's life they are sent to live with a terrible man called Count (shudder) Olaf. He makes them do HORRIBLE chores and doesn't care if he hurts them or not. Oh, and one last thing . He will stop at NOTHING to get the Baudelaire fortune. Nice, huh? <br /> If you want to read about something fun and happy ,like maybe a happy little elf, you would be better off reading something else.Besides that, I would recommend this to anyone (adults included) that likes Harry Potter, Pendragon, or Charlie Bone.

B00005JLEX|5.0|I am so glad to finally see these shows being released on DVD. This first box set includes seasons one and two, in which the show and characters were still evolving. Perhaps these episodes aren't the best of the series run as some reviewers have suggested but they are still absolutely hilarious. My personal favorite of the set is Season 2, Episode 11, \\"The Heart Attack,\\" for the absolutely sublime scene with the holistic healer, which also spawned some wonderful outtakes.<br /><br />The set comes with many extras including interviews and commentary, and a feature called \\"notes about nothing\\" which puts interesting facts about the individual episodes on the screen in the style of \\"Pop Up Video.\\" I recommend watching the episode without this feature first as the notes are distracting unless you are already familiar with the plotpoints. There are also numerous alternate scenes, deleted scenes, and outtakes, all of which are very entertaining.<br /><br />I love \\"Seinfeld\\" and this set is so well done that it makes all the waiting worthwhile. This is the best possible way to spend your comedic entertainment dollar.
B0000DBJDM|4.0|Ya know, if this disc were in 5.1 Stereo, I would give it a '5 Star' rating, easily. This is Pink Floyd at their finest. This is before they became the 'Rock Gods' they now are. Not that their 'Rock God' status is a bad thing. <br /> <br />I really love the interviews and everything they recorded at the studio. As much fun as they have there, it's really too bad they had to end in a feud with Roger Waters. <br /> <br />But the real feature can be found in the 'Bonus section.' The 'Original Concert Film' is the main reason to buy this disc. Amazing performances of terrific songs are all around. I really like the versions of all the songs here. \\"Echoes\\" would almost beat the studio version if they hadn't split it in half. The version of \\"Careful With That Axe, Eugene\\" is the best I've heard. Plus, \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\" is really good here, and this is coming from a guy who is NOT a fan of the studio version. <br /> <br />Buy this disc. Even though it's only in 2.0 stereo, it's one of the best concert discs out there. If only they'd release PULSE or a concert from the ANIMALS tour on DVD.
B0002KVUL6|4.0|This is a great movie. However, it may only appeal to youth and us oldsters who cut our teeth on dozens of horror genre films in the 50s and 60s. You never get bored. The story is clever and so \\"campish.\\" For example, Anna (Kate Beckinsale), the heroine of the film, never has mussed hair or disheveled clothing, and her makeup is always fresh.  Plus, she wears one basic outfit during the whole film and it is never tattered or torn even though she is slapped repeatedly by the same vampire, falls off several edifices, etc. <br /> <br />The special effects are outstanding.  There's never a dull moment and the ending, unlike most of the story, is not predictable.  It's a fantasy adventure sure to be loved forever by fans of the \\"horror\\" genre.
B00008BRBG|5.0|I became a Police fan upon many nights cruising with pals cranking their greatest hits album. Upon hearing all those songs, I decided that this was a band that I needed to look more into. So, I quickly bought all their albums, as I'd already done with Pink Floyd. Seeing as how The Police have around 1/3 the number of albums that Pink Floyd have released, this was much easier on the wallet. <br /> <br />OUTLANDOS d'AMOUR is an excellent album, and I think it just might be The Police's finest. There's really not one bad song on it. \\"Next to You\\" is a great rocker. I think \\"Born in the 50's\\" might be my favorite one on the album. It should've been released as a single, along with \\"Roxanne\\" and \\"Can't Stand Losing You.\\" \\"Roxanne,\\" by the way, is one of the greatest rock songs ever, even with its vehement overexposure. Just avoid the MOULIN ROUGE version. <br /> <br />Buy this album, quick-like.
B00003CY6M|1.0|With its strained references to the ancient Greeks and its self-conscious, self-congratulatory (\\"listen to how smart this line is!\\") script (which may have read better on paper than it did out loud and on screen), this movie aspired to offer more depth than the typical romantic comedy. And in its overreaching lies the seeds of its tragedy.     Not that its insights, for all their fanfare, were even novel. Sleepless in Seattle has made a similarly sappy (but better written, better acted, and way funnier) pitch for destined love and soulmates, which at least steered clear of pretentious classical allusions and confined itself to appropriately shallow pop culture references. Tackling the same topic but doing a better job at sounding smart and educated is the Before Sunrise/Before Sunset series. Perhaps Serendipity was attempting a high-wire act by combining the commercial appeal of Sleepless in Seattle with the depth and intelligence of Before Sunrise/Before Sunset - to have its cake and eat it, too, in effect - but falls flat on its face. Miserably.
B000066C8G|3.0|If you are a dedicated follower of fashion, Zoolander might be of special interest to you.  Die Hard Ben Stiller fans might appreciate this as well.  However, the rest of us will find this as a middle of the road comedy that plays off the joke that models are self absorbed and quite stupid.<br /><br />I will admit that Ben Stiller's facial expressions and speech patterns are quite comical.  The pacing is pretty decent and the gasoline fight scene is totally off the wall.  However the cyber effects get a bit annoying after a while.<br /><br />Try something else by Ben Stiller as the laugh appeal is limited.
B000003TA4|4.0|Well I grew up right when \\"Grunge\\" came about to the mainstream in 1990(I was 13) When Facelift from AIC came out. So in 1991 when the rest of the Fab 4 hit the mainstream(Nirvana, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam) The only Thing MTV would play or should I say overplay was anything by Nirvana. Don't get me wrong its a decent CD but the damn thing was overplayed. I personally think the reason why MTV played so much of Nirvana because it was further away from a Rock band in a traditional sense. If you look at the other 3 thier sound was a little more traditional in a sense of pure musicianship. I mean the jump from the Hair metal of the late Eighties to Nirvana was astounding. You can definitely see the change in sound and the look and that is why I think MTV really keyed in on Nirvana. You only had 3 in the group and at the time and thier sound was so Uninhibited with a raw hard kind of punkesque feel which made it kind of unique. I guess I am one of the few who when they saw Nirvana for the first time that their jaw didn't drop to the floor in amazement. They were a solid band at the time. <br /> <br />My Fav Tracks: Polly, Drain You, Come as you are, Breed. <br /> <br />Their best cd was Unplugged. Kurt really show cased his talent with that Disc. It showed that he could play guitar well and sing well too. JMHO
0375432302|5.0|I'd heard a lot about this book and seeing it sitting on my brother's desk obviously meant that I HAD to pick it up. 9 hours later, at 2am in the morning I finally finished the Da Vinci Code and it was good to the last word.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code brilliantly collects together many facets of art, historical, theological and modern day symbolism and weaves them into the mysterious European setting. Many beliefs, 'facts' and theories that have been floating around for years crop up in here - from the mischieviousness of Leonardo Da Vinci manifesting in his famous paintings like the Last Supper, Madonna on the Rocks and the Mona Lisa to the multitudes of Grail Quests, origins of words like the Roman sub rosa... and even to symbolism in the Little Mermaid!!<br /><br />I felt that though quite a few of the little factoids Brown throws together in his book ought to be taken with a grain of salt, they're nevertheless intriguing enough to have the curious and skeptical scrounging the depths of the internet and literature to uncover their truths (and un-truths).<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code is ingenuous in that it is a work of fiction that for the often SEEMS to be written with the intent of being a non-fiction. Being raised a Catholic myself it's obvious that it was inevitable that the book would cause some degree of outrage and 'scandal'; but I don't doubt that Brown wrote it knowingly (perhaps a parallel to Langdon?). This book is definitely one of the best I've read and it's pages are rich with depth and knowledge, woven through with hints of the intangibal supernatural and mystique - enough to keep your mind occupied and constantly searching every time you re-read it.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Slayer Are the reigning gods of metal and thats all I got to say so to everyone and I hope that everybody gets that. Thanks for listening. Satan Rules. SLAYER is Awesome remember that.
6305949980|5.0|Tim Burton's THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS is a masterpiece.  There's simply no other way to describe it.  The story, the music and the animation combine to present probably the most original and unique Christmas tale since the original animated HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS.<br /><br />The movie nicely showcases the vocal talents of Chris Sarandon (THE PRINCESS BRIDE), Catherine O'Hara (HOME ALONE I and II) and, of course Danny Elfman.  Elfman's score for the movie is also masterful.<br /><br />THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS is a terrific tie that connects the fall seasons, from Halloween to Christmas and promises to be a holiday standard for decades to come. You will also enjoy the many special features, including FRANKENWEENIE and VINCENT, two Tim Burton shorts, that are included on this DVD.<br /><br />THE HORSEMAN
B0002XDODU|4.0|Rammstein fans: like mine, your initial reaction to this album may be somewhat negative, or just thrown off. For me this is because Rammstein have taken another creative jump, going further from Mutter than Mutter went from Sehnsucht. For a while, I felt that Mutter was simply superior to R,R, but I have come to fully embrace the new sounds. Artists are only so because their art is dynamic. Conversely, static art serves no function. And to quote another favorite, Type O Negative, \\"Functionless art is simply tolerated vandalism.\\" Pay no heed to the 2 accordion appearances and the mentioning of \\"Micky Maus,\\" Rammstein can still be as hard as ever; on the other hand, later tracks show their aptitude at slow, (mostly) soft love songs. Sadly, there are a few tracks I would leave out. Keep in mind that I give this album a 4 only because of that Mutter was my favorite album of all time; I find it perfect in every sense: compositional, musical, etc. Anything else is a step down. <br /> <br /> <br />Reise, Reise -5/5- This one has what I can only call an \\"Epic\\" feel to it. I can't explain that, but it has something to do with the synthesis of the guitars and choral sections. What little vocal experimentation therein is superb. Ahoi!  <br /> <br />Mein Teil -3/5- Vocal experimentation on Mein Teil, however, is somewhat annoying. Till sounds like an old man with a sinus infection (listen, you'll know the part). Synth is lacking, but near the end, hits the \\"creepy\\" nail right on the head. Guitars are good, but lack the necessary oomph because of the weak drums. <br /> <br />Dalai Lama -5/5- Incredible. Just hearing the song gives me an image of a lone plane being buffeted by the jealous heavens, and certain sections (interludes? I know little about the name for it) bring to mind perfectly a scene of turbulence, torn apart with the thunder wrought from Rammstein's dual guitars. This may be the longest song on the CD, but I still can't get enough of it. <br /> <br />Keine Lust -4/5- Great intro, synth and guitars alike. Vocal rhythm (nearly iambic) just isn't my cup of tea. Perfect song for driving, but I would tweak the outro. <br /> <br />Los -3/5- I like the adventurous spirit of the idea behind the song, but it just doesn't do a lot for me. Wordplay is a plus. I don't mind the acoustic guitars, and even the quirky, almost country-sounding solo hits a good note.  <br /> <br />Amerika -2/5- Ugh. It's sad how much I like the lyrics, and how much I abhor Till's inept English crooning. It wasn't good the English version of Du Hast or Engel, which should be cautionary tales to Till. But If any song calls for English, I suppose this is the one. Overall, just... no. <br /> <br />Moskau -1/5- This hurt me. For years I had faith in Rammstein. Faith that they wouldn't go and sell out. But whoever it was that set this up- Jakob Hellner, or the members themselves- was tragically misguided. A lot of things can be made better by the addition of a couple of young Russian lesbians, but this song is not on of them. I first heard about the matchup and immediately thought of Kira Lindemann's cameos, a positive prospect. But TATU chant in styles that are much better left to Till. This collaboration could have been so much more.  <br /> <br />Morgenstern -5/5- Personally, I think this song makes up for Amerika and Moskau. This one gives me that same \\"Epic\\" feel Reise, Reise gave me. A major aspect I love is the drumming. It sounds somehow exotic in its rhythm, somewhat Latin. Choirs are the cherry on the top, solidifying even more that connection to Reise, Reise. It's a relief, as it ends that mid-album slump.  <br /> <br />Stein um Stein -3/5- Not bad, but not great. I'm okay with this song, but the vocals aren't the best. They did a great job in making the song give forth a laborious feel to it, as if one could see a man lugging great stones over to a wall in progress. <br /> <br />Ohne dich -5/5- I love this song. As soon as I heard it, I set out to learnhow to play it. This, along with Amour, beats Seemann as Rammstein's best love song yet. Guitars are beautiful and mellow.  <br /> <br />Amour -5/5- One gripe I do have about Rammstein's love songs is that they always go heavy. For once I'd like to hear how they do without power chords; I'm confident the result would be incredible. In Rammstein's characteristic ironic, contrary, and very tongue-in-cheek (enough to be overlooked) sense of humor, it ends heavily, with Till begging for poison. Ah, L'amour.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Executive produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks for HBO, Band of Brothers is a ten-part miniseries based on the book Band of Brothers: E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne From Normandy to Hitler's Eagle's Nest by Stephen E. Ambrose. The series dramatically re-creates the path of Easy Company, an elite paratrooper unit, from their basic training at Camp Toccoa in Georgia in 1942, to D-Day, to their critical involvement in the Battle of the Bulge, through their triumph at the close of the war. The unit was one of the best trained and most productive in American military history, but it also suffered immense casualties. The series is an ensemble piece, involving dozens of characters, and cast with relative unknowns. To the extent that there is a central character, it is Dick Winters (Damian Lewis), who went to Toccoa as a lieutenant and was promoted, over the course of the war, to battalion commander. Each episode includes brief excerpts from present-day interviews with some of the surviving members of the company. While the series is not a hagiography, Winters is depicted as a brave, resourceful, and humane leader. It's clear that the men revered him, and that he genuinely respected and cared about them. There are a few other members of the unit that make a strong impression. Sobel (David Schwimmer of Friends), their C.O. at Toccoa, is depicted as a petty tyrant whose men bond together in their hatred of him. Nixon (Ron Livingston of Office Space) is Winters' fellow officer and best friend, and an alcoholic. Carwood Lipton (Donnie Wahlberg) is a decent, hard-working man, and a tremendous soldier who earns a battlefield commission for his exemplary leadership. Bill Guarnere (Frank John Hughes) fears nothing, and is known for his wise-guy attitude and hot temper. The series dramatizes the courage and fortitude of many others, but it's clear that Winters sets the tone for his men, and plays a pivotal role in the unit's success. The project involved several screenwriters, including Graham Yost (Speed) and E. Max Frye (Something Wild). Eight different directors were called upon for the ten installments, including Hanks, David Frankel (Miami Rhapsody), Mikael Salomon (Hard Rain), and Phil Alden Robinson (Field of Dreams). Still, the tone and style of the series remains fairly consistent. While the story of Easy Company has been condensed and altered in some minor ways for dramatic purposes, and much of the dialogue was, by necessity, invented, the producers placed a strong emphasis on accurately depicting the conditions under which these men lived, fought, and died. Several survivors from the company consulted on the project, and an enormous amount of money was spent on sets, costumes, and special effects in order to re-create their experience.
0790751216|4.0|Although Pale Rider is one of my favourite Clint Eastwood movies, I have to admit that it could have been much better.  As in The Outlaw Josey Wales and High Plains Drifter, for example, we have a protagonist who is haunted by a past injustice, an injustice which he strives to rectify through the barrell of a gun.  Unfortunately, in Pale Rider, the score between Stockburn and Preacher is much too vague, and so instead of adding to mystery, the viewer is left somewhat baffled.  Over all, though, the movie is still very good, and definitely entertaining.
B0000027I6|4.0|I hate to say it, but this sounds much more like Pink Floyd than THE DIVISION BELL did. I wish that Roger had gotten with the boys left in the band and they had teamed up to bring us AMUSED TO DEATH. It would've been better than DARK SIDE, I'll venture to say. <br /> <br />As is, this is his best solo effort. It's nearly perfect. If it were trimmed a bit, it would be. None of the songs are bad, but the album feels a bit stretched at around 72 minutes. Another detraction is his voice. It's gone here. If he'd gotten with the Floyd, Dave could've sung most, if not all, of the songs, and they'd sound so much better. But the lyrics and music more than make up for his voice, so it's not too horrible. Plus, Don Henley <br />makes an appearance in one of the songs, so it helps out. Don's a good deal better than ol' Paul Carrack, on KAOS. <br /> <br />Jeff Beck's guitar is fantastic here, and the music is uniformly excellent, unlike Roger's two earlier solo efforts, which were a bit hit and miss. <br /> <br />Buy this album immediately. This is what THE DIVISION BELL should've been.
1592400876|5.0|A book about punctuation?  Who would have thought a book with such a topic could be so readable, and even may I say, enjoyable?  In Eats, Shoots and Leaves, Lynne Truss has broached a topic that many only thought would excite high school English teachers.  However, as I continued to read, I realized how right she is.  Commaphilia is extremely prevalent in today's society.  Many times, I have read papers or notes that have included way too many commas.  Hey, I may have even included too many in this review.  Lynne makes grammar comedic, and her antics caused me to laugh at how pitiful we all are in our use of the English language.  So the moral is to pay attention in high school English, right?  Or, it is to not take it too personal when you see the poor use of grammar on the side of a bus or on local billboards.  Lynne gives great examples and may make you a better writer, or at least a better spotter of bad grammar, by the end of this enjoyable read.
B0000CEB4V|4.0|The first I'd heard of this was a commercial on TV. I saw Sir Paul and Eric Clapton singing \\"Something\\" and decided then and there that soon this disc would be mine. I quickly bought it and have never regretted it. <br /> <br />It's a great concert and a very sweet tribute to George Harrison. Seeing all these fantastic musicians onstage at once really showed how important George Harrison was to music and what a terrific guy he must've been. <br /> <br />All the music is good. It even made some of the songs I originally disliked, like \\"Horse to the Water,\\" listenable. I even enjoyed the Indian music section, and I am not typically a fan of such music. <br /> <br />For $23 or so, you'd can't afford not to pick this up. It's a fantastic buy.
0312263120|5.0|Ok Im sorry. But Dan Brown writes fictional stories. He doesnt make clames that everything is a fact. What the hell is wrong with u people! If you want to read about something and learn something grab an encyclopedia. I dont care if he tries to convince the world the there is evidence that the sun gets hotter and hotter and we will all be dead in a year. Ahhh you will never get it!
B0000025ZF|4.0|Okay, so technically THE BODY with Ron Geesin was Roger Waters's first solo album, but we won't count that, will we? <br /> <br />Anyway, this is a good album; very underrated in many of the reviews I've read for it. Sure, 90% of it sounds like \\"In The Flesh\\" from THE WALL, but it's still good. The lyrics are very good, and much of the music is terrific. Clapton sounds great here. <br /> <br />\\"Running Shoes\\" and \\"Every Stranger's Eyes\\" are the best bits. If the entire album had the energy and emotion these two have, this would've been a five star album. As is, four is fair for it. It's better than THE DIVISION BELL, at least.
B0001YRVN4|2.0|I am still surprised that Geroge Lucas changed so many things in the film! And most notably, the ending of Return of the Jedi. I couldn't belive it! Instead of the having the original actor, they replaced him with Hayden Christean ( sp? )! I don't have anything against him, but come on! He probably didn't even know what star wars was when return of the jedi came out. So, instead of this, please stick with the VHS verison which haven't been messed with. Even though the picture quality on the film is GREAT actually. The VHS is much more better simply because you can get to see the original trioglys without anything being changed.  <br />
B000002UB3|5.0|As much as I would've loved for the Beatles to keep going, at least they broke up on one of the greatest albums ever produced. This is one of the few albums that I can sit through two or three times in a row and not get tired of. <br /> <br />It starts with a fantastic one-two punch. \\"Come Together\\" followed by \\"Something.\\" There is not a finer start to an album out there. Sure, \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" is a slight drop in quality from those two, but it's still nigh-fantastic. <br /> <br />Of course, the real reason to get this album is \\"Here Comes the Sun.\\" That is, by far, the greatest Beatles song they ever recorded. I bet you thought I'd say the reason to get the album was the big medley on the second half. Well, that's a good second reason to get it. It's neat. Not as great as people make it out to be, but almost. It's a better concept than Sgt. Pepper, and, if it were a bit longer, would've been a fantastic album unto itself. I dig \\"Polythene Pam.\\" <br /> <br />Get this album. You won't regret it. I mean, it's the greatest album by the greatest Pop/Rock/Boy Band ever.
B0002JJBZY|4.0|I couldn't give Star Trek any less than 4 stars simply because it's Star Trek, a show that I've been watching since I was a baby, and has had an immense influence on my life.  The Original Series is an important show, and finally being able to get it in an all-in-one package for a (fairly) reasonable price has taken too long.  There was no way I as a rabid Star Trek fan wasn't going to beg for this for Xmas.  I'm glad I have it in my collection.<br /><br />But if I could give a separate rating to the quality of the transfer, I'd give it 2 stars.  How ironic that a show that deals with humans using technology to achieve and explore has been released by humans witholding technology to maximize profit.  Despite a new, cleaned up digital mix of the audio, the video portion of the DVD's still contains the little scratches and video noise that my original videotapes possessed when I bought them in the 80's.  There have been too many old movies and TV shows digitally remastered and beautified for me to believe that they couldn't clean these episodes up and give us better picture quality. It's a crime that Paramount continues to milk the original Trek dynasty like this.<br /><br />It's quite obvious that there will be yet another re-release of the series down the road, but I can't see waiting any longer.  The Harry Mudds have won again.
B00008BRDX|4.0|If only The Police had stayed together. Maybe I'd still be a fan of Sting. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate Sting's music, I'm just not a fan of his newer stuff. But, I'm getting ahead of myself. This is another excellent album by Sting and the boys. Of course, it's only their second together, so it's a good thing that this one's as good as their first. How can an album that starts with \\"Message in a Bottle\\" be bad? Apparently, it can't. <br /> <br />There's not a bad song here, and I think my favorite is the slightly insane \\"On Any Other Day.\\" It's filled with rather nice non-sequitirs that eventually add up into an excellent song. <br /> <br />If you're a Police fan, this is a no-brainer: Get this album immediately. If you're not a fan, I'm sorry.
B0006A9FMI|5.0|This movie lives up to its predecessor in every way; in terms of animation and artwork, it far surpasses it.    And if you think that SquareSoft animation is good, then you're in for a rude awakening because this movie proves what you would have little doubt left of if you have seen Dead Leaves - Production I.G. is a force to be reckoned with.    ...    But the DVD is a real dogpile. There is a surprising lack of special features, and there are no proper English subtitles; you have to get used to watching it with captions for the hearing impaired. It's also a little disappointing that there is no English language dub, but that's not such a big deal.
078061755X|3.0|Shine is a movie that definitely took a great deal of thought and planning.  The premise is the realtionship of a classical piano playing son prodigy with his passionate yet abusive father.  When the father refuses to allow his son to pursue his talents in London, our hero runs away to rebel against his father.<br /><br />Later on he suffers a nervous breakdown and stammers terribly throughout the course of his adult life.  He finds a love interest and is able to find eventual success in his musical pursuits.<br /><br />There is some excellent cinematography particularly of the sheer expression of our hero's piano playing ability.  Somehow the repetitive scenes of our hero standing in the rain or throwing his eye glasses off gets a bit wearisome.  Nonetheless, our hero perserveres in the end so the sense of triumph does extend this rating to about 3 1/2 stars.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I think the reason this movie was so hilarious to me is because I LOVE silly humor.  I GET silly humor!  If you don't get silly stupid humor don't see this movie... if you do YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE!!!  I'm 35 years old and I went and saw it with a couple of my friends and a lot of the younger kids that are in our area were there for the 4th time.  I was skeptical at first but then the movie got started and then I laughed harder than I have ever laughed in my life!!!!
B000056HE9|4.0|Christmas is now complete. I've again seen The Bishop's Wife.  David Niven is the Bishop with a hot poker up his butt. Loretta Young is his simple-minded wife, Julia, who puts up with him. Then there is the angel, St. Dudley aka Cary Grant. The bishop prays for an angel for help & gets Dudley.  Not exactly what he was hoping for. Dudley starts by giving Julia the attention she's been missing, squiring her around town showing her a good time, things she no longer does with the obcessed bishop. Julia falls in love with Dudley. Dudley can't fall in love with Julia because he's an angel. Or can he? The bishop is the only person that knows Dudley's an angel, feels jealous & wishes he would go back to where ever he came from.     But the bishop has lost his way in his lust for a new cathedral. Dudley gently guides him back to doing the right thing. The end is bittersweet. I always hope that when Dudley gets ever so close to Julia in an intimate moment that they will kiss. They can't of course. They saved that for off camera when the movie was over
6302510414|5.0|Fay Wray is remembered not just because she played opposite King Kong but also because as Ann Darrow she was both sexy and vulnerable. Plus she had the big ape's lung capacity beat six ways to Sunday as the greatest screamer in movie history. Granted, the special effects by Willis O'Brien are enough to make this a classic film, the cinematic forefather of \\"Jaws,\\" \\"Jurassic Park\\" and other celluloid monster movies that involve something other than an actor in makeup. But every time you want to reduce \\"King Kong\\" to pure technical achievement, you hear Fay Wray screaming her head off.<br /><br />The story was pretty much a clich&eacute; the moment it was set down on paper. Movie director Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) has heard the legend of Kong and hires a ship to find Skull Island. Ann Darrow is starving and destitute, but photogenic and he hires her to be the beauty part of the equation in the film he has planned. Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot), the first mate of the tub they are traveling on takes an interest in the young girl's safety, and she responds with guarded affection. Then they get to the island and he discovers that he is indeed involved in a love triangle, but the third party is not Denham, but a giant ape.<br /><br />One thing you have to give directors Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack credit for in this film is that they give Kong a big build up and then they deliver. On the way to the island Denham was making a film test with Ann and had her scream. Then she sees Kong for the first time and takes it to a whole new level. At that point the film becomes a series of action sequences as Kong takes the girl into the jungle, Driscoll leads a rescue party after her only to have Kong follow them back to the native village (the look of terror on Wray's face as she runs for her life through the jungle is equally memorable), which Kong proceeds to destroy before being captured. Then there is the final act of the drama as King Kong, the 8th Wonder of the World is put on display in New York City, only to break free, once again capture Ann, and take her to top of the Empire State Building (whose lights will be dimmed tomorrow night in Wray's honor).<br /><br />I think the T-Rex attack sequence in \\"Jurassic Park\\" is one of the greatest in any monster movie ever made, and I have argued that in addition to the special effects and the masterful cutting of the scene, the sound of the T-Rex is an integral part of what makes the scene work so well. Tonight I am going to make the same argument for Kong's first appearance in \\"King Kong.\\" After all, we are talking about mixing stop motion animation with a giant mechanical head, but such \\"primitive\\" special effects are forgiven because Fay Wray's screams convince you it is really happening. She was not remembered just because she was the girl in \\"King Kong\\" (quick, name the actresses who had the female lead roles in \\"Dracula\\" and \\"Frankenstein\\"). She was remembered because she was an integral part of the film's success (To save you the trouble of looking up the previous trivia point: Helen Chandler and Mae Clarke).<br /><br />You might have heard that Peter Jackson, as his next project after \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" is doing a remake of King Kong for 2005. The cast has Jack Black as Carl Denham, Adrien Brody as Jack Discoll, Andy Serkis as both King Kong and Lumpy the Cook (?), and Naomi Watts as Ann Darrow. Watts is a fine actress, but can she scream like Fay Wray? I don't think so. But then Jessica Lange was not exactly a great screamer and her career turned out okay.<br /><br />Final Notes: This is the \\"restored\\" version of the film, but it still does not include the legendary scene when four crewmen who are shaken off the log by Kong fall into a ravine where they are eaten alive by giant spiders. When first previewed the scene stopped the movie cold and Cooper pulled it from the film. The scenes that were cut in the late 1930s and not restored until the 1970s were (a) whereKong pulls Ann's clothes off; (b) the shots of the Apatosaurus (nee Brontosaurus) biting the sailors; (c) Kong eating natives when he breaks through the gate; (d) Kong stepping on a native; (e) Kong biting a New Yorker after escaping from the theater; and (f) Kong grabbing the wrong woman from the hotel and throwing her to her death.

0767834739|3.0|Sheesh, some of the reviewers for this movie must've thought they were gonna get The Godfather Part II or The Shawshank Redemption. I mean, come on...unless you've had your head in the sand, you oughta know Resident Evil: Apocalypse is nothing more than an action-horror popcorn flick based on the popular videogame. If THAT doesn't keep your expectations in check, then you must set yourself up for disappointment wayyyy too much in life. Anyway, I liked this sequel slightly more than the original, and I think it was because most of the action took place above ground...at times, I thought the original RE felt somewhat constricted, not fully capturing how large the underground facility really was. But this time, the effect is not just limited to (mostly) Umbrella employees in closed quarters, but the \\"common folk\\" of the entire Raccoon City perimeter as well, so you get a better perspective of just how out-of-hand things have gotten. The zombies, lickers, and devil dogs are back, and there's also a new troublemaker in town (the Nemesis). In addition to some of the characters, RE purists will recognize some locations and/or screen shots that pay homage to the game. Bottom line: good mindless fun, and a couple of sexy [...]-kicking heroines (Milla Jovovich & Sienna Guillory) never hurt either...there's always a time & place for movies like this. (FYI: The extra features are enormous & also worth checking out, my favorite being the commentary featuring a HILARIOUS Milla...BTW, even SHE knows it ain't Shakespeare) 3-3.5 stars.
0679735909|5.0|\\"Possession\\" is far above and beyond the kind of books usually labelled \\"romance.\\" It's lushly written, with exquisite characters, great poetry and interweavings of legend and myth. It's almost chastely erotic, mysterious and dripping over with Victorian-era romance. It's hard not to be drawn in.<br /><br />A young scholar, Roland, stumbles accidently on an old letter from acclaimed poet Randolph Ash. He soon has reason to believe that the letter was to Christabel La Monte, a lesser-known \\"fairy\\" poet -- except Ash was happily married, and La Monte was single all her life. Roland and the chilly fellow scholar Maud investigate caches of hidden letters, poems, and diaries by the lovers, wife, friends and relatives.<br /><br />In the past, the cordial letters of Christabel and Randolph blossomed into love and passion. They vanished for a short, blissful time together. But what happened to Christabel and Randolph's love, and why did Christabel leave England, while her companion Blanche committed suicide? And how do these events somehow involve Roland and Maude's own growing attachment?<br /><br />They say the pen is mightier than the sword, and in \\"Possession\\" it's a valuable historical tool. When words are hidden or read, it can change perceptions and even lives. Byatt's own words are wonderfully lush, dreamy and vivid. Given the rather formal language and writing, it almost seems like a nineteenth-century novel, as if Byatt got so swept up in the characters that she started writing like them.<br /><br />Byatt has an excellent eye for the language of the era. The letters, poetry and fiction of Christabel and Randolph have a very authentic feel. Especially since Byatt manages to change tones for different people's writing (Christabel's  poetry was a bit reminiscent of Emily Dickenson's). The only problem is when the book veers into long tangents; Byatt seems to get a little off-track there. But most of the time, the richness of Breton legend adds depth and mystery to an already beautiful novel. The sunken city of Is, the legend of Melusina, and many others are here.<br /><br />Byatt gives us an amazing look at the ill-fated lovers, Christabel and Randolph; you can feel their passion and love. They aren't just attracted to each other, but drawn together in the mind and spirit. The supporting characters, such as the artist Blanche and devoted, wistful Ellen Ash, are equally well-drawn; you can't dislike any of them. Roland and Maud seem a little anemic by comparison, but they are still compelling characters, caught up in a love affair from over a hundred years ago.<br /><br />After taking the recommendation of a good friend, I found that \\"Possession\\" is the kind of genuine, heartwrenching romance that you don't see much of -- meetings of minds, genuine passion and love. It's a beautiful thing, and something to be deeply treasured.ery to an already beautiful novel.

My favorites are \\"Used to Love U\\", \\"She Don't Have to Know\\" and \\"Refuge\\". The track \\"So High\\" was the best in concert - it gave me goosebumps!  GET THIS ALBUM!  I'm already anxious for his next one!  It's such a welcome change to the ordinary stuff we hear on the radio.
0385473788|3.0|While reading over these reviews, I'm surprised no one mentioned the fact that this was the \\"Definitive\\" edition. And make no mistake, that's not just another fluffy adjective affixed on the end to sell more books - it serves a purpose! This is not the original Anne Frank that sold so many books over the past decades. The \\"Definitive Edition\\" includes entries originally omitted in the original book - passages on sex, hatred for other family member, her side comments on entries, etc. Apparently it constitutes 30% more material, so even if you've read the original book before, you'll find new stuff here.<br /><br />As for the book - what can you say? It's a girl's diary, so how can you criticize? You can't call it too \\"boring\\" because it was her life. And you can't really call it excessive because it's the \\"Definitive Edition\\".. so it's SUPPOSED to include everything.<br /><br />I did find myself frequently getting bored with the book, though. What can you expect? She spends 2+ years of her life in an attic. The true interest of the Holocaust happened in the concentration camps, not while in hiding.  Yes, it's a tragedy that she died - but that shouldn't automatically assume 5 stars. In fact, I think had she lived, this book would not be regarded as highly as it is.<br /><br />Even as a \\"holocaust\\" book, it's fairly weak. There's not as much historical influence as we'd like. The book doesn't have much of a logical flow, either. It starts off very slow (and very dull), but all of the sudden jumps into the topic of Peter out of nowhere. Not to mention, there are two Peters in her life, which she doesn't separate until later in the book. Quite ridiculous (and quite confusing)!<br /><br />I appreciate the fact that they released these withheld passages, as they do help to shape Anne as more of an \\"imperfect\\" person. I think, though, given the audience they're trying to reach, they could have cut a lot of unnecessary stuff out. For the die hard fans, there will always be the \\"Critical\\" Edition.. and I think this one tried too hard to be a companion.<br /><br />Nevertheless, at the very core, this book represents the optimistic attitude of so many people during the war. It's worth a read, at least once, even to realize you don't like it. Historically, it makes us realize just how similar we truly are, despite nationality and time periods.the \\"Critical\\" Edition.. and I think this one tried too hard to be a companion.<br /><br />Nevertheless, at the very core, this book represents the optimistic attitude of so many people during the war.

B0002Y4T92|5.0|This was an excellent set of DVD's for any avid guitar player. The highlight of the set has got to be the performance of JJ Cale on the first disc. from that performance we learn some interesting things about Eric Clapton, the most notably being the way Cale phrases his guitar solos which are quite remenicent of the \\"Slowhand\\" Clapton style. <br /> <br />The only downside is there isn't a version that has ALL of the festival on it. A great purchase and a true piece of future guitar history.
0140277447|3.0|This was truly eye-opening b/c of the lack of awareness that this event ever occured.  That is the point and the double-tragedy of what happened.  Much like the Nazi atrocities of WW2, it is hard to believe that man could act in such a way to others.  The book is informative yet somewhat repetitive.  A couple of times I swear I was reading word for word what I had already read.  Otherwise, it was very interesting.
B00000ADG2|5.0|To be honest, the only reason I got this cd was because I got an iPod, and decided that I needed to buy as many albums that were considered to be \\"great\\" as possible (I'm very eccletic).  I knew that Lauryn's album had to be at least decent because of all the attention it got when I was younger, but after listening to it, I can't believe it has taken me so long to actually go out and buy it.  At the same time, I'm glad it did, because I probably wouldn't have had the appreciation for it when I was younger that I do now.  I'm actually listening to it right now,  every song just flows and touches you.  I can't stop listening to it.  I'm not going to go through every song and rate it, because every song adds something different to the album, and it would be a dishonor to rate each individually.  If you haven't bought this cd yet, I definitely recommened doing it immediately.  It's amazing, it's touching, and it's addicting.
B000050HTO|1.0|Oh I do despise these 'the essential' collections.  A taste of a genius? Not even close! Can these 'compilations' seriously claim to do justice to anyone whom they target? Dylan and Cash are perhaps the main victims of these atrocities...  Why should iconic, prolific artists have their superb albums, which are supposed to be listened to in context, culled into the average 'joe indifferent's idea of an 'essential', but one which the record company will even admit is a shameless capitalist venture! Please don't do it! Why can't it be accepted that this is not something which can be achieved sympathetically? As the Amazon Review lays bare, how can 4 decades of genius be condensed into 1 cd? My bitter tirade aside; some constructive comments: I discovered Bob Dylan's genius not listening to the cliched 'best' - I'm talking about 'Lay Lady Lay or Blowin'...; but listening to 'Love And Theft' (2001).  I then looked into the classic 'Highway...', 'Blood...', 'Blonde...' and, my favourite EP, 'Shot Of Love'.  There won't be any more like Dylan. His influences? No. He is the influence. He is my influence in life, too.
B000002HHB|4.0|I've certainly heard 10,000 Maniacs, but Natalie Merchant's solo work is significantly better. Her lyrics reach deeper while creating people and places that you can feel. \\"My Beloved Wife\\" is perhaps the saddest song I've ever heard and she handles it beautifully with strong lyrics and simple accompaniment. \\"River\\" takes an angry look at the death of River Phoenix. I continue to enjoy this album in different ways the more that I listen to it.
B00005JN0T|4.0|Grab your popcorn, sit back and enjoy this action packed sci-fi thriller. \\"I, Robot\\" delivers big budget special effects with strategic product placement and Will Smith's backside. Those are true, time-tested marketing ploys to get some free press. Yes they worked.<br /><br />\\"I, Robot\\" begins with an apparent suicide of an engineer pioneer for U.S. Robotics.  Detective Spooner (Will Smith) is sent to investigate.  Spooner has a reason to be suspicious of labor robots. Is that why he was chosen as the lead investigator? Someone is trying to leave him clues to a classic robot mystery. (Who operates the robots?)<br /><br /> The NS4 robots are about to replaced with the newer updated model NS5s. Everyone wants and gets one.  Hold your flux capacitor, those pesky NS5 models have a secret. One NS5 model (Sonny) is the prime suspect. What. A robot.<br /><br />The NS4 robots have three rules: Rule #1,Obey humans, Rule #2, Protect humans from harm! Rule #3, everything else not covered by Rule #1 and 2.<br /><br /> Of course human nature must tend its ugly hand. Detective Spooner and Director of Robot Relations Susan (Bridget Moynahan) join forces to destroy (Not kill) the NS5s.<br /><br />Is this film a premonition of the future of our society?  The labor robots do everything from cooking, cleaning and pleasure dealing for humans. Who cares! Can I get one now!<br /><br />This film utilized mostly green screen acting. Not even noticeable with the actors. The \\"Making of\\" is interesting and divulges the green men. The bonus features include upcoming movie trailers of \\"Electra\\" and \\"Robots.\\"

0060989157|5.0|Although I have not finished reading it, it is already the best book I have ever taken the time to read. I cannot put the book down. I am a huge fan of Motley Crue, so I'd probably enjoy it if it sucked, but even if you don't like the band, it is a very powerful and entertaining book. It follows the complete history of the band, told by the four members and a few others. It tells their comlete story including Vince Neil's accident that killed one of his best freinds, Nikki's troubled childhood, and the drug binges and partying that ensued. Overall, it is a great book that every heavy metal fan should read.
B0000DC13U|5.0|I personally love The Stones and I also think that Godard is one of a handful of great directors. Godard has always been somewhat of a revolutionary, artistically and politcally. <br />Everybody who sees a Godard film walks away with something different. His films are complicated and not linear or straightforward. <br />I'm not going to get into the details because that would take too long. But, what I saw, was a sharp, biting social and political commentary of a film that was wrapped around one of the greatest songs (a song that had everything to do with what Godard was trying to get at) of all time. The song is the film and the film is the song. The song provided the film with an unusually emotionally charged atmosphere for Godard. One that, for the most part, he avoids in most of his work. This resulted, in my opinion, as one of his most watchable and entertaining works. <br />...and yes, the Stones developing their art, taken on its own, was ALSO quite fascinating.
B0002858YS|5.0|I bought this album thinking it will be so-so but I was wrong. I really enjoyed this album I still listen to it after a couple of months yet i'm wearing it out. There's no song on this album that I don't like I can't say theres many albums I feel the same about either.

B000005Z0E|4.0|I am deep into old-school and underground Hiphop, and I churned every time I heard 2Pac's name or mention as the greatest rapper of all time. Finally, I had to see what the hype is all about, I just went out and started with his first album here. 2Pac's a lot easier to understand if you have a taste for Real Hiphop(old-school/underground), but if you like commercial rap, you will probably only recognize the thug/gangsta/playa side of Pac instead of the conscious/poetic/afrocentric Pac. <br />Yes, I can say that there are a few moments that I really enjoyed in this cd. Powerful songs like \\"Words of Wisdom\\" showcase his socially conscious and political concerns, which hold up there with those like Public Enemy and KRS-One, who he suprisingly shouts out to at the end of the track. \\"Trapped\\" is an excellent song about trying to escape the confines of the ghetto, at least in attitude. However, it seems to contradict his music in the mid-90's where he delved heavily into materialism, fame, and gangsta involvement. Elsewhere, he weaves dark stories on \\"Brenda's Got A Baby\\" and \\"Part-Time Mutha\\" that hit home. \\"Brenda's\\" beat and chorus almost sounds like a crossover attempt at first, but Pac's verse definitely doesn't! There are some other decent moments, and then some that you are forced to simply look the other way, basically when he devotes whole songs to threatening, guns, and violence. 2Pac's filler songs on his albums are so evident, and such a falloff from his substantial material. <br />The best tracks off this album are: \\"Trapped,\\" \\"Words of Wisdom,\\" \\"Brenda's Got A Baby,\\" and \\"Rebel of the Underground\\"(just a classic old-school track, just smooth and enjoyable)! <br />The decent tracks are: \\"Soulja's Story,\\" \\"Violent,\\" \\"If My Homie Calls,\\"(kinda sappy and almost corny, but nice to hear from him) and \\"Part Time Mutha.\\" \\"Something Wicked\\" was okay, pretty catchy, but really short and unfulfilling lyric-wise. <br />I understand and respect 2Pac a lot more now. WhileI can't approve of his antics in the public spotlight his last couple of years, there was another side of him that was never really shown on TV: a softer, concerned, intelligent side. I don't think I will ever idolize Tupac the man, but definitely some of his music I enjoy and revere. There are so many followers out there claiming that Pac is the best rap artist ever, and now I see some evidence of that argument. At least he had some substance unlike those fake gangstas that we hear on the radio today. I'm not hating, I just wanted to point out some reasons why I believe he's NOT the best artist ever. His flow was pretty bad, real choppy, although he did the best he could with it. Pac never really used intricate rhyme schemes(like a Rakim or a Pharoahe Monch for example) and his vocabulary was pretty much just as simple as his rhyme scheme. He may have used a big word every now and then, but for the most part the vocab was rather simple. Also, he cursed a lot, A LOT! I know a lot of rap has cussing and I don't mind it, but Pac cussed like the words had no meaning at all, and c'mon, as much as you can defend it, you still have to dock him a little bit for cussing so much. Some songs literally every other word was a curse!  <br />Despite all these flaws, Tupac still made some compelling, intelligent, and even coherent music. I think it's a case of the sum being greater than the parts. One of the few from the West Coast who actually had something significant to say. I think he can be considered one of the best political emcees, and his concern for his people's welfare was eye-opening. The sad thing is, most these rappers since Pac's death revere the gangsta/playa side of him rather than the alternative. You can say that he propelled and influenced both conscious and gangsta rappers alike, just like KRS-One is credited with doing back in the late-80's. 2Pac was an above-average, maybe even top-tier rapper who was comfortable with numerous subject matters, but the few that were and are focused on by the media have increased his legacy for sure, yet have overshadowed what he was really about, or at least initially about.

B0002DRDBE|5.0|For me \\"Clerks\\" has always been the essential Kevin Smith movie. I mean it started it all. \\"Clerks\\" was the first Kevin Smith movie I ever saw, and I guess it still holds a special place in my heart. The script is by the funniest thing Smith has written, we meet our heros Jay and Silent Bob for the first time, Dante and Randal are hilarious, and the situations the characters are put in are just out and out funny. Only Smith's experience working at a Quick Stop in New Jersey could have helped him write such a funny movie (which if you read the booklet with the DVD Smith says himself.) <br /> <br />The tenth anniversary addition is well worth owning, even if you already have the movie. The bonuses are a great buy for the price. Disc one is of course the full theatrical version of \\"Clerks\\", Disc two is the first cut of the movie which is fun to watch if you've already seen it to see what's left out or changed, and disc three is all about the story of \\"Clerks\\". If you don't already own the movie, you now have even more motavation to buy the anniversary addition. For those who haven't seen the movie, \\"Clerks\\" is a story about a guy named Dante. Dante works at a convience store called, oddly enough, Quick Stop. The movie follows his odd encounters of working behind the counter dealing with troublesome customers and annoying bosses. His buddy Randal works at the video store next door to the Quick Stop (both owned by the same owner) and frequently comes in to stir some things up. The ideas and situations in the movie are just so funny, and so true to life, that everyone can appreciate what Dante is going through. The hilariously funny dou of Jay and Silent Bob only add to the laughs even more.  <br /> <br />I strongly encourage you to buy this DVD. Even if you already own it, the bonuses are just too good to pass up. And with a price tag of around $20 (considering that you buy it from somewhere like Wal-mart or Target) is well worth the price of admission. If you love KevinSmith movies, or Jay and Silent Bob, and somehow all the years you've just managed to elude \\"Clerks\\", then what are you doing still reading this? You should be out buying this right now. Hilarious is the only word I can use to describe this movie. You should definitely own it.

B00012QM8G|5.0|You have a spectacular masterpiece . It will seem you exaggerated from my position , but never before in Hollywood you could watch a peaceful , artistic and extraordinary well made film , with detailed minuteness , intelligence and good taste .<br /><br />The cast is simply superb . Liam Neeson gave the performance of his life as Schindler the man who broke in his business but helped more than one thousand Poland Jews from being exterminated  Ben Kingsley is the conciliate factor and obviously what else can you add to this actor who actually is one of the twelve giants actors in the world . And finally Ralph Fiennes who grew up one thousand steps with this role as an abominable and hated Nazi all along the film without falling in overacting .<br /><br />The locations in Poland are first rate , the sinister atmosphere, the ravishing handle camera , the splendid photography and a fine script make of this film to my mind the Best American Film of the Nineties , one of the three most ambitious and compelling films which dealt with this theme  and the supreme masterpiece of Steven Spielberg .<br /><br />And this happens only when the camera is an eye in the mind of a poet .<br /><br />Spielberg followed his bliss and won for ever . You can forget all his previous works , because with Saving Private Ryan , Spielberg has been one of the few directors capable to give a tragic and epic vision of the War in less than a decade among both films.  .<br /><br />Pitifully these giants films are not the rule but the exception .<br /><br />.
B0006A9FMI|1.0|Do not purchase this DVD.  It is absolute trash.  The only subtitles they have are closed-captioned for the hearing impaired, so you get captions like \\"person walking, someone singing in japanese, etc....\\"  This is completely inexcuseable, and ruins the film.  It is beyond annoying.  I recommend staying as far away as possible from this release.  Hopefully a proper version will be put out in the future, as such as terrific film definitely warrants one.

B0002ZDVEU|5.0|I'm a big fan of spy thrillers.  I saw the Bourne Identity in the theater and it didn't thrill me too much.  So when Supremacy came out I passed.  But I rented the DVD just on a whim and liked it so much I watched it 3 times and returned it late.  Good action, sensible plot, likable heroes and despicable villains, and an overall message about the importance of fighting for the truth.  A classic film.  I highly recommend it.
B000003S0F|5.0|This is a very unique album right here. I have heard no other album with this unique style.

It's truley brilliant and beautiful.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|I am 36 and loved this movie. Why 4 stars and not 5? Well, its not a masterpiece, but it delivers a lot of laughs with unknown actors, with good acting and poking fun at elements of American society that are never touched in most movies. The critiques some reviewers give are true: it has no plot, and the characters are all dimwits. But that doesn't mean it isn't hilarious. I won't badmouth the people who hated it, because my wife is one of them. This movie requires a certain sense of humor. If you have my wife's sense of humor, and think Shrek is really funny (I watched the entire Shrek 2 movie plus the DVD extras, and I think I laughed twice), then you won't appreciate this film. If you like silly/quirky humor like me, you will probably laugh a lot with this film. I like comedies that are silly, quirky and relatively clean. Some that come to mind are Airplane!, Three Amigos! and The Emperor's New Groove. If ridiculousness makes you laugh, there is plenty here. Rent it first, then if you like it, buy it to encourage the filmmakers to produce more. As for the acting, those who say these guys can't act somehow don't seem to realize that these actors are not the dopey people they seem to be in the movie. It takes talent to pull this off. These are not over-the-top Jim Carrey performances. These characters are completely believable, and I don't laugh at them, as one reviewer suggests, out of any sense of superiority, but because the things they do and say are so ridiculous and at the same time believable. I would eat lunch with Napoleon and Pedro any day, and I was never a nerd. Classic moments include Pedro shaving his head one afternoon when he realizes that his hair is making him hot, then realizing that his chances of winning the student body president spot will be hurt by his bald dome, so he gets a girl at school to find him a wig. The way these characters approach the whole ridiculous situation in a totally matter-of-fact, deadpan way is what makes it funny. Theydon't appear to see anything funny here. They're just reacting the best they know how to their circumstances. Most comedies, on TV and in the movies, are very predictable, with cute jokes and lots of grinning at the camera. If that's American comedy, this is the anti-comedy, about awkward people dealing with awkward circumstances in what seems to them a very logical way. I still love my wife, and she still loves me. Different people find different kinds of things funny. It's good to know there are a lot of others out there who enjoy this kind of more subtle but much more hilarious comedy.

B0001I55OC|4.0|The movie is very different from the book.  However, I'm fascinated by the concept of time travel (which the book stressed this wasn't, but for simplicity's sake...).  I liked that no matter what the main characters did which might screw up history as they knew it, everything worked out the way it was supposed to.  A certain sense of destiny and fate.   <br /> <br />It's an action movie.  Take it for what it is and enjoy it.  Plus, Gerard Butler and Paul Walker aren't hard to look at... :)
B0002BO0AS|5.0|This is one of the best cd's I have gotten in a long time.  Theses are some of the best musicians i have ever heard, with the wailing guitar solos, earth shaking drumming and the singer has one of the best screams I have ever heard.  All the songs on here are great but the best songs are \\"Black Hearts Now Reign\\" \\"Zombie Autopilot\\" \\"Predetermined Skies\\" \\"Endless\\" and \\"Bloodlust for the Human Condition.\\" Here the ratings for all the songs. <br /> <br />from 1-5 stars <br /> <br />1. The Great Dividers-*****-great opening track <br />2. Failure-****-pretty good song...hard to remember though <br />3. This Lying World-*****-awesome begginning the whole song is great <br />4. Black Hearts Now Reign-*****-best song on here...the drum solo is AMAZING. <br />5. Zombie Autopilot-*****-awsome song best part is near the end. <br />6. Bloodlust of the Human Condition-*****-prob. their heaviest song. great guitar solo. <br />7. Lie to Purify-***-kind of a boring song. <br />8. Endless-*****- this song never gets old...its awesome <br />9. Aries-****-softest song on the record...its pretty good. <br />10. Predertimen Sky-*****-great song...the drumming is amazing in this song and he does double bass for the longest time..its crazy. <br />11. False Idols-****-good song...not much say aout it its just a good song. <br /> <br />buy this cd now...this is one of the most talented hordcore bands out there right now and plus the cd is only 10 bucks.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I was so let down with this film. Was this supposed to be funny? Oh look at me I'm so nerdy I'm almost funny. Almost. Let's make it look like a cross between the 70's and the 80's but it actually isn't the 70's or the 80's. This will completly distract about 3 morons from seeing to how lame this movie is. <br />Watch Rushmore instead of this waste of time.
B00005JMYI|4.0|Will Ferrell shines in this movie about the old boy's club at a 1970's TV news show being threatened like anything when--of all things--a WOMAN is hired to join the crew. Will Ferrell plays Ron Burgundy; Cristina Applegate plays Veronica Corningstone, the newcomer on the block with a strong willed desire to be an anchor herself. Farrell, especially being the male chauvinist as he is, sees Corningstone's arrival as yet another chance to have himself a conquest. Corningstone, predictably in this type of plot, wants no part in an office romance. Worse yet for Ron Burgundy and his male buddies on the news show: newcomer Veronica Corningstone actually knows something about journalism!<br /><br />There are numerous funny moments in this movie here on DVD. There's of course the gang warfare between five (count 'em, five) separate news channels that's really well done. Another scene worth mention is the scene with Ron's dog that despite being a bit troubling is actually hysterical. There's Steve Carrell as the weatherman with a questionable IQ level who refers to the state of Iowa as \\"the Middle East.\\"  Moreover, there are some great cameos by such pros as Tim Robbins, Danny Trejo and Ben Stiller.<br /><br />While watching this movie you get the sense that the actors really wanted to do it to showcase their talents and just plain have fun making a fun movie. My advice is not to go into this comedy expecting it to be literally flawless. Instead, this comedy flick is perfect for the person who wants to enjoy some laughs and funny situations while relaxing their brain and not worrying about following a complicated plot. Yes, I know, there's the subplot theme of the 70's feminist movement, but without any doubt this takes a back seat to the comedy.<br /><br />The DVD comes with great extras that increase its value. Extras include the \\"Making of Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,\\" bloopers and deleted scenes, and (of course) the \\"Ron Burgundy A&E Biography.\\" Sound and picture quality are very good.<br /><br />I would encourage you to get this DVD: the movie itself is very good for a fun time! Fans of Farrell and the Saturday Night Live style of comedy are going to be especially pleased with the way they made this DVD! The extras make it all the more worthwhile.d picture quality are very good. <br /> <br />I would encourage you to get this DVD: the movie itself is very good for a fun time!

B000063DFQ|5.0|Iron maiden has made some music during thier career that you simply never outgrow or get tired of.No matter what bands you come across in your metal journy that make you think,\\"sick\\" or \\"brutal\\"or \\"holy Sh*t this kicks A$$!\\",you will always come back to Maiden,they simply never get old. Some of the best metal ever recorded is found on this disc and the fact that there are 2 week songs still don't hold this back from getting less than 5 stars! If you don't like this you probably don't like metal. That is realy all thier is needed to be said about this album.
B00003CXSM|1.0|I couldn't believe how bad this movie was.  What's bad about it?  Ok, the acting for one.  Mathew MacConaughy is by far the worst actor in the business.  J-Lo's father has the worst Italian accent ever portrayed.  The script: recycled humor, idiotic situations, ridiculous stereotypes, lame dialog, and complete predictability.  This movie was a chore to sit through, worse than any movie I have ever seen except \\"Cecil B. Demented.\\"
B0002KVUKM|1.0|I will admit right off the bat that I didn't make it through the first half hour. Normally, I will not even bother to write a review if I see so little of a movie. However, with this movie, I was so repulsed by the set up that I feel a civic duty to warn everyone off this joke.    Van Helsing works for the Vatican and is off to help out a family of Transylvanian vampire killers. Had it been left at that, it would have probably worked. Even with the ridiculous Q type friar that comes up with all of these gadgets in the most blasphemous 007 \\"satire\\" ever, it might have been one of those charming action-adventure-comedy type movies like \\"The Mummy\\".     But no, all the movie monsters are in this one. Frankenstein's monster, Dracula, Wolfman, and even Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde make an appearance.     Maybe I've missed this grand \\"point\\" that these other reviews seem to want to insist makes this movie more than the showing off of special effects. Maybe I am too much of a purist to appreciate these monsters crossing over from their stories into a common story line, like the old \\"Godzilla vs. King Kong\\" type movies that stank, too. I couldn't get past that, and don't feel that the special effects are worth sitting through something so downright stupid! Why is it that when people are making movies nowadays, that they sacrifice storyline for special effects and vice versa. You can have both!    If you want overkill on movie monsters, take a trip to California or Florida and go to Universal Studios. The cheesiness is not going to be worse than this movie, which on my Cheese Scale, rates as Moldy American Cheese That Is Stuck To the Cellophane. If you want a real monster movie, and you want it to be injected with some humor, get \\"Shaun of the Dead\\". If you want straight up horror, then avoid this like its contagious.
B000059T00|5.0|Most people know that after Cream broke up, Eric Clapton diddled around a little in a few side groups before settling into his long solo career.  Derek and the Dominos is the best known, and they probably should be, the \\"Layla\\" album is great, and it contains some of the last studio momens from Duane Allman.  However, the Blind Faith album may be the best album ever by a band that only made one album.  If you think Winwood and Clapton just bask in the spotlight, you are wrong.  This is Ginger Baker's album--just a fantastic drummers album straight through.  \\"Can't find my way home\\" is a classic, as is the sound that resonates through most of this beauty.  Most have heard of Blind Faith and paid little attention simply because there was little fanfare regarding this effort (possibly because most were pissed at the breaking up of Cream and Traffic--ow!)  Sure to please, this album has it all.
B000002KIT|5.0|I've owned this CD for forever and am here to pick up a new copy. You see, I slammed my car into a tree at 60 mph (they estimate) and now my CD will not eject from my player! Oh, well, it's a pleasure to buy it again. I just wish my ten bucks was going to one of the greatest rock poets of all time-miss ya Phil.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised. I expected to dislike the movie..the trailers looked absurd and the idea of this overgrown \\"elf\\" in the costume...I thought the movie would be a real dud. <br />Instead I was glued to my seat, it was funny and sweet and tender. I even shed a few tears during the caroling at the end.
B00005JK8K|1.0|For those who don't know FUBAR is something, well, ahem...shall we say messed Up Beyond All Recognition.  This film fits the description. A travesty.  Let's just say that if the USMC actually fought the way Nick Cage and John Woo would have us believe, sushi would have become popular in this country 45 years sooner.  John Woo appears to think pyrotechnics make a movie.  To be honest I have not yet been able to sit through one of his movies without loosing interest in the first 20 minutes of non stop gunfire. <br />This one makes a pretense of character development, but fails.  Better he stick to making bubble gum for the eye for today's attention challenged generation of video game players and leave making historically accurate films to others.  Yes, we owe a debt to the gallant Navahoe braves who fought and died in the war without any recognition till late, but they deserved better than to be trotted out for PR stints to promote this abortion.  I mean I thought Saving Private Ryan set new standards for realizm even with it's flaws.  But Mr Woo must have been sleeping during the period and learned his realism by watching reruns of \\"The A' Team. His combat scenes are reminicent of the 1950's where the bad guys can'ts shoot straight enough to hit someone 30 feet away and guns never ran out of ammunition, and an empty ration box would stop a .50 caliber bullet.  I openly laughed as I watched the Marines march in convoy formation within full view of enemy occupied heights just asking for an artillery barrage to make their day.  This film was rubbish and an embarassment to the USMC.  Better rent Sands of Iwo Jima with the Duke, or the Halls of Montezuma with Richard Widmark.
B0006A9FMI|1.0|The movie is worth the money alone, an amazing sequel from another amazing movie. definitely the best anime movie i've ever seen.<br /><br />However, the dvd sucks. sucks alot.<br /><br />Dreamworks put no effort at all into this. let me list the cons<br /><br />-bland, boring artwork<br /><br />-no real special features, simply imported from the jap. dvd release<br /><br />-no english track (how stupid can you be?)<br /><br />-the subtitle option is quite annoying, implying that the audience must all be deaf because they feel the need to subtitle every little sound you hear...<br /><br />its clear that dreamworks simply wanted to put this out as fast as they possiby could to cash in on the hype. it shows simply from the fact that the japanese got their dvd in november.. now how often does an anime come out here 1 month after the japanese release? usually it takes a year.<br /><br />i bought this because i love the movie, but i wish someone else would have gotten the rights to it. if dreamworks acquires another good anime.. i will cry.<br /><br />there is no doubt in my mind that within a year or two from now there will be a \\"special\\" version that will have REAL special features, better artwork and packaging, and OH MY GOD an english track.<br /><br />Basically it will be the version that should have been from the get-go.<br /><br />Screw you dreamworks, you don't know what the fans want. you're anime distrubiting ways sicken me. why couldn't you just let bandai/manga get the rights to this seeing how THEY HAVE THE REST OF THE FRANCHISE UNDER THEIR BELT. bandai would have made this the way it should have been.
0553573403|4.0|I thought that this book was very well-written and worth reading. However I was very disapointed with some of the things that were refererenced and scenes that were very detailed having to do with sex. I thought that these were not needed. I personally do not think that these scenes needed to be in there, but for people it may be okay. I wouldd really like to give this book a 3.5 star counting. I wasn't overly impressed with the plot itself and for me it was really hard for me to stay focused. This took me a week and half to finish, but then you also have to understand I just read a 518 pg. book in a day and a half. If those scenes were not in there I'd give the book a 4.5 star rating. The book is very well- written just not a book I would not go out and buy.
0780020685|5.0|Kurosawa's \\"Seven Samurai\\" is a breathtaking film experience. It is a stunning film that is filled with grand performances and breathtaking battle sequences. Every one who watches will felt like they have journeyed with these seven men through the film as they prepare to save a small village from bandits. The final forty-five minute battle sequence will have you on the edge of your seat until the very end. Though the film is over three hours long, the film's amazing cast, the breathtaking battle scenes, and the outstanding cinematography will grab you, and you will forget about the length. So prepare for battle with the \\"Seven Samurai!\\" Movie/DVD Grade: A+
B000067J1H|5.0|Based on the novel, Fight Club is a true cinematic masterpiece! One of the best movies I've ever seen... There's fighting, drama, philosiphy, sex, an intricate storyline, and the power to bring hordes of people together... While the critics hated it, this is one of the greatest movies ever made!
B00006AG5N|5.0|Why do the music packagers have to say that?  Trust me, if you don't already know, a number of these tunes were never #1.  Some never APPROACHED #1.  The fact that they are all good tunes by the King is this package's saving grace.  Joe Dowell had a bigger hit of \\"Wooden Heart\\" in 1961 than Elvis' album cut from the \\"G.I. Blues\\" soundtrack, a variation of a German tune in old German, \\"Muss i Den\\".  1962's \\"She's Not You\\" never hit #1 though I loved the song. \\"Hard Headed Woman\\" is an example of early Elvis; I contest the claim it was #1.  Along the way Elvis would do cover songs of others' hits like Hank Snow's (\\"Now and Then) There's A Fool Such as I\\" and Ray Peterson's \\"The Wonder of You\\"; #1s? the former, maybe, the latter, probably not. \\"One Night\\" that became a virtual Elvis signature song after his 1968 \\"comeback\\" special might have been #1 then or when it first came out, but the original 1955 Smiley Lewis version (one night of sin is what I'm now paying for) had better lyrics. During his generic period, Elvis also had a cover of the Orioles' \\"Crying in the Chapel\\"; it got up there but #1?  Not sure. 1959's \\"Big Hunk of Love\\" (backed with the exceptional \\"My Wish Came True\\",not on this package) may have been #1.  \\"Are you Lonesome Tonight?\\" that dated back originally to 1926 and which was recorded as a favor to the illegal immigrant, \\"Colonel\\" Tom Parker, was likely (an unexpected) #1.  Am I picky?  Yes.  The packagers come off like country music compilers calling a 1970s country hit \\"#1\\" when it was actually #82 on the more meaningful pop music survey where the money is. (This, before country music became what it is today).  It is unnecessary when you have this many great tunes that did rise to places high on the charts to label them falsely.  They don't need such unnecessary hype; must have been the bogus colonel's idea.  That would be just like the man who plundered Elvis' assets and held him back, not raised him to the highest level.  Enjoy this music, #1or not.  It's worth it despite the misrepresentation.
6305165912|5.0|This is a cinematic masterpiece on so many levels... The \\"Fight Club\\" of 1998, there's not only a story that seems simple and is amazingly complex, but there is blunt truth about society and philosiphy on life... Great acting jobs, amazing script (extremely quotable) and one of the best \\"Buddy\\" movies I've ever seen... In the style of a Raymond Chandler novel...
B00006LLLN|5.0|I've always been very discriminating in music.  Few country artists could ever impress me, Marty Robbins, Jim Reeves, singers like that maybe.  And bluegrass performers?   Forget it!  I grew up in Tennessee but I dug R&B, soul, blues, things like that in general.  I still do.  For a long time, it seemed all the country music people could do for bluegrass was to trot out Bill Monroe (who always seemed to a hundred years old). With apologies to Ricky Skaggs, was bluegrass gone?  So what if it was?  Then came Alison.  Where had she been?  How could she be so talented, so,uh, eclectic (ahem) with that resume of experience, so sexy? And where did she get that soulful, crystalline voice that conveys so much emotion that you cannot help but be touched?  Never mind that she's dynamite with her fiddle too.  I sit limp and listen to the music in this package, humbled by the sheer beauty and the broad range of emotions.  Nothing else quite compares to the songs herein as a whole.  I feel like a sinner brought home in shame to repent.  My apologies to Bill Monroe, Ralph Stanley and the High Priestess of Bluegrass, Alison Krauss.  And if you already LIKE bluegrass, this is your meat.
B00003CXCD|5.0|You know why Audrey Hepburn was well-loved when you watch her in Roman Holiday as the innocent, suffocated princess who gets a chance to spread her wings and fall in love during an exciting trip in Rome.      This classic film introduced the world to a bright-eye young Audrey whose films tops the charts in the most beloved romantic films of all time.  See the film to understand why the vespa is a symbol of romantic freedom.  If you have ever visited Rome or would like to visit Rome, this is one of the best films to see to truly appreciate Rome, gelato, and the Spanish steps.      DVD highlights - the special features which include interviews with Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn's audition tape.     Putting a Best Word Forward.
B00004Z459|1.0|a lot of screaming, no sence for creativity (they all sound THE SAME), Get rid of all the distortion and messed up voice effects and they aren't even under a label.  GARBAGE IN, GARBAGE OUT.  I almost feel bad for giving it a single star...way too much credit.  Musicians????  BAH!
B00004ZAV3|3.0|remember that this is a compilation of songs #1 on the billboards, so it comes across as a randomly chosen compilation, which I admit, it's kind of a bad idea, considering that it leaves out a lot of great songs, and ignores the fact that the beatles made some very artistic albums that rose above the likes of \\"I wanna hold your hand\\".  For example, \\"Rubber Soul\\" was the birth of art-rock and revolutionized music, but couldn't provide a song \\"good\\" enough for 1. \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" has been numourusly been called the greatest album of all time and represented the Beatles at a creative peek, but has no cuts on this album.  Aww cool, just reached a new hackey sack record...4. The White Album has 30 songs, all of which are great but not worth the track time on this album.  my suggestion is to get \\"Rubber Soul\\", \\"Revolver\\", Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\", \\"The Beatles (White Album)\\", \\"Abbey Road\\" and maybe \\"Let it Be\\". but if your low on cash flow or not patient enough to buy all those albums \\"1967-1970\\" is a much better compilation. I guess u could get this one after you've bought all the above albums because it has some great songs not on an album like \\"Paperback Writer\\", \\"Lady Maddona\\", and \\"Hey Jude\\" and has some of the good early stuff that appear on albums just not worth buying like \\"Help!\\" \\"Yesterday\\" and \\"Penny Lane\\", i guess the only thing wrong with that system is nowhere do you get my favorite Beatles song \\"I Am the Walrus\\". Peace out
B0006A9FMI|2.0|Firstly, this DVD has NO ENGLISH VOICE TRACK. That is a major negative. I personally hate subtitles as they distract you from what is going on onscreen. I prefer english voice actors, and would have preferred the same actors from the Stand Alone Complex series (and the original movie) to reprise their role, but obviously no love (and money) were given to this movie to be able to put it out in the best possible format. I would have gladly waited another 6 months to a year to have that version, and I suppose I will be waiting and shelling (pun intended) another 20 bucks out for the next version. <br />The movie itself is good with the most breathtaking animation I've ever seen, it's mix of traditional and CG animation is nearly flawless and beautiful. <br />Buy this DVD if you can tolerate subtitles (and subtitles that let you know ever sound effect as well as words), but if you can't, wait for the money-making better edition that will, sooner or later be made.
0743454529|5.0|This was one of the best books I've read in a long time.  I'm not referring to how the author wrote it, the plot development or characters - I'm talking about the book - the story - itself.  It was just a great book - I have recommended it to all my friends - and I will go back and read some of Picoult's other books.  Enjoy!
6305907145|3.0|The cast is very good. Jonny Lee Miller is a perfect Edmund. BUT, if you expect it to follow the book, you'll be disappointed. There are some dramatic differences. Fanny is less reserved here, for one. She reminds me a little of Catherine from Northanger Abbey.     I like the movie now, but I was too surprised the first time I saw it. If you're looking for a faithful portrayal of a Jane Austen novel, try Pride and Prejudice (Special Edition)(1996) with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth.

B0002Y4TTC|4.0|The DVD concert is great, the audio is amazing, and the picture is even better !!! All the best songs are on there (except for Twilight Hall, but thats in the bonus DVD)They dont show much of the bassist or the keyboardist very much at all, and at times theres a serious lack of enthusiasm from the band, but the crowd loves every second of it !!!<BR>The problem I had with it is that it has a subtitle option for the concert DVD and all it shows is the name of each song.. In between songs he talks a lot and its all in german, and I was hoping/expecting that the subtitles were of what hes saying, not just the name of the songs...<BR>All in all a great first Blind Guardian DVD, I just hope the next one has subtitles of what hes saying !!!!
1592400876|5.0|The book is great except for one thing...the ampersand in the title!  I thought that this little squiggle was only intended for proper names such as John Smith & Sons, Inc.  I was under the impression that it was not to be used as a \\"shortcut\\" in general text. <br /> <br />Am I wrong?
B00007K02F|5.0|I absolutely loved this very warm, loving,tear jerking movie. <br />It was everything you could want in a love story. The first time I saw it on cable I knew I had to have it.  I really really enjoyed this movie, I thought it was perfected love.
0780628551|2.0|I knew \\"The Outer Limits,\\" and this, \\"Virginia\\", ain't no \\"Outer Limits\\".<br /><br />Two astronauts lose two minutes during a routine space walk and we, the viewers, must endure one hundred and nine minutes of pure movie-watching HELL.<br /><br />It's not that the stars aren't doing the best with what they've got.  Depp makes an effective is-he-or-isn't-he husband of Charlize Theron, appropriately unnerved by the creepy goings on around her.  Sadly, the duo is saddled with a less-than-thrilling script and an inexperienced director.<br /><br />While it's great to see character actors Blair Brown, Donna Murphy, and Joe Morton, they, too, are wasted.  Brown, an actress whose film career hasn't grown like her weight, has very little to do as the wife of Depp's new employer.  Murphy, a well-respected stage actress, has about as much screen time here as she did in last summer's blockbuster, \\"Spiderman 2.\\"<br /><br />Morton is basically playing the same character, though slightly unhinged, that he played in \\"Terminator 2\\"...or was it on TV's Smallville,\\"...or was it \\"What Lies Beneath\\"?  Either way, he doesn't have to stretch his acting chops on this one.<br /><br />This is one time when the appetizer (the trailer) is more filling than the main entree (the film, itself).
0743455967|2.0|I generally enjoy reading Stephen King although it's my opinion that his earlier offerings were more fear inspiring then some of his later novels.  \\"Salem's Lot\\", the first of his stories I remember reading, scared the be-Jesus out of me.  From the middle to the end of the book I wouldn't pick it up unless it was a bright sunshine filled afternoon.  Because I really liked reading his stuff, and because I am an aspiring author, I looked forward to reading \\"On Writing\\".<br /><br />  Most those who like to read Mr. King's work will probably enjoy reading \\"On writing\\" as it offers insights into his life and gives glimpses of how his outlook on everyday events was shaped into the horror stories he is so well known for.  I enjoyed reading it.<br /><br />  Unfortunately those who are expecting a primer on writing will be somewhat disappointed.  While there is the occasional \\"gem\\" of advice for aspiring writers within the pages of this book they are well hidden and too infrequent to make this a really helpful read for writer wannabes.  Someone interested in learning the writer's art might be better off reading \\"The Marshall Plan for Novel Writing\\" by Evan Marshall or taking one of the on-line \\"Writeriffic\\" courses offered by Dr. Eva Shaw.<br /><br />  \\"Readers Digest\\" could do a good job in condensing the available advice in the 300 pages of this paperback into a two and a half page article with plenty of space left over for a bio of Mr. King.<br /><br />  Who am I, I hear you ask, to criticize this book?  A mere unpublished writer wannabe with the chutzpa to critique a famous, successful author, that's who.  Is this a great country or what?<br /><br />  I liked this book, it just wasn't what I was anticipating or expected.  For someone looking for help in pursuing a writing career I leave you with one overused phrase from \\"On Writing\\", \\"fuhgeddaboudit\\".<br /><br />Al Fleming
0201485672|5.0|Although this book has been around for a few years now, the technique that Fowler names \\"Refactoring\\" is as old as programming.  I've been doing refactoring for the twelve years I've been a professional programmer, often to the chagrin of my supervisors; they often seemed to subscribe to the \\"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\\" mentality.  Yet I could always tell that the code *was* broken, even if it didn't appear that way when the product was used.  I was beginning to suspect that I was the only one who saw this, and then I read this book - written by an eminent researcher in the field and one of the brightest people to ever put pen to paper. <br /> <br />By giving a name to the technique, it can be talked about in planning/design meetings, discussed as a best practice, measured, and demonstrated.  But Fowler takes it much further - he gives names to common refactoring techniques as well as what he calls \\"bad smells\\", or signs that you need to refactor.  (\\"Speculative generality\\", for example - a perfect name for an annoying tendency of the 10,000-foot architects). <br /> <br />This book is well-researched and well thought out, and is a must-read for anybody who's serious about software development.  It's principal value is in providing common terminology for common actions, in addition to good justifications for each refactoring.
B00004RJEG|5.0|I've waited for 3 years before it can be for region 1, it is one of the best DVD's from The Corrs, if you are a fan, you must have this.
B0002X314C|5.0|I love this cd. The lyrics and his vocals are great. Unfortunately I have had this cd burnt for about 3 months before the cd was released and this is one reason why I am upset that there is no promotion for this cd. This was heavily bootlegged and he even metioned it in several of his interviews and I was hoping that he would have waited and re-released all new material. But overall this cd is excellent so definately go out and support this Shining Star!!
B0006A9FKA|2.0|Ok first let me say I love Zombie/horror/gore movies, I just freaking love them. <br />So when I heard they where making a comedy about zombie movies I was like this is going to be great, and then the reviews started coming in and it sounded really good, the hype was high...so what happened? Did they all see a different movie then I did? Cause the movie I saw was your typical zombie movie with a TINY bit (and I mean tiny bit) of humor in it. That's it, nothing new, nothing original, nothing great. Below average at best. <br />I've seen the good zombie comedies, Dead Alive, Evil Dead 2, Army of Darkness...this one falls short of all of them by miles. <br />Where's the humor...I mean every now and then we have a scene that should be funny...but the humor never comes out, I don't understand it? Why are there so many good reviews for this bad movie? <br />Unless you are starved for a zombie flick don't pick this one up, don't make the same mistake I did.
0743455967|3.0|As a writing manual, this book doesn't offer much that's new, but the 100-page \\"On Writing\\" section is a useful summary. Stephen King's a fine story-teller and the memoir part of this book gives us some insight into the oft-twisted mind that came up with great page-turners like \\"The Dead Zone\\" and \\"The Stand.\\" The description of his days of hard labor at writing before his breakthrough should inspire anyone who's plugging away at any kind of writing.
B00005JMUL|5.0|wow this movie was so cool.the animation looked so real.definitely a perfect childrens movie.tom hanks is the best.i hope they make a toy story 3.when this movie comes out it should be two-disc.that would make it so cool.
B0001L3MI0|5.0|I actually saw Independence Day on its opening day in the theater on July 2nd, 1996 (it opened a day ahead of schedule), and it was a total blast. After its opening day, the hype for the movie mounted, and there were lines of people stretching for blocks waiting to get a ticket. Independence Day definitely kept with the tradition of top-notch summer Hollywood blockbusters, which started in 1993 with Jurassic Park, and ended in 1997 with Men in Black. I've noticed a string of one-star reviews from people here and a the IMDB. Apparently, there are some very angry, overly-PC people out there who like to bash Independence Day because they claim it promotes Unites States nationalism. To each his own. They can think what they want, but I'm sure they never had the rush of seeing a presumed-dead alien popping out of its spaceship while Will Smith's character shouts \\"Welcome to earth\\" and proceeds to knock the bugger out cold. For those out there who like to politicize Independence Day: Notice how he did *not* say \\"Welcome to the U.S.\\"    After having seen Independence Day once in the theater and countless other times on video, I will admit that this is one of those movies where you obviously have to suspend belief, but it is one hell of a ride if you just let the movie immerse you. The special effects are still better than what you see in movies nowadays, plus the cast is excellent (Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and Bill Pullman!). Simply put: If you want a movie that includes aliens, a possible apocalypse, and lots of guns (whether it be laser or the traditional pistol), you will definitely get your money's worth.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|This 2 DVD set features some of the greatest living guitarists.  It would certainly be improved if there were more of some of them, like Buddy Guy, who's performances are always smokin' hot, or Steve Vai, or even John Mayer, who shows he can really play.  By the same token, some folks who appreared at the festival or who jammed together are absent, like Jeff Beck, and, I believe, Pat Metheny.  Anything from the aforementioned folks would be better than J.J. Cale, whose performance is so subdued its almost painful, and I personally could do without a solo performance from Robert Cray in favor of the others I mentioned.  BUT--there's so much good stuff on here:  the blues jam with Buddy Guy, BB King, EC, and Robert Cray, a hot performance of Have You Ever Loved a Woman from EC, an amazing display of blistering speed by John McLaughlin, and good stuff from just about every other performer.   <br />In spite of the fact that this package could be better, it's way too good to pass up, especially for all the guitarists out there, like me!
B0000A0DRY|5.0|What more could one want? I especially liked the addition of the two mono versions. I wish there was also a vinyl scratching effect to get more nostalgic!
B00003CWLF|3.0|The acting and story in this were very good, but it was lacking something for me. Maybe I'm just too used to the musical version (it's called The King And I.) I've seen the movie countless times and even saw the play at my local theater. It was the touring company of the Broadway play. Jimmie Walker starred as the King and he was brilliant!<br /><br />Getting back to this movie, like I said, it was good. It's worth seeing. Of course, anything starring Jodie Foster is worth seeing. I've been a fan of hers ever since she was in Zapped with Scott Baio.
B000002952|5.0|I can't say anything more about this CD, it's perfect and everybody should know that by now. Perfect, perfect, perfect! <br /> <br />Don't think twice, just get it!!!
044024157X|5.0|I have been very disenchanted with ol' John lately - every novel seems to be very heavy-handed anti-corporations, etc (King of Torts and Runaway Jury immediately come to mind).  THIS IS HIS BEST BOOK since The Firm.  LOVED LOVED LOVED it and I am recommending it to everyone (including you amazon readers)!
B0006A9FKA|4.0|Great Zombie movie, great comedy.  Hindsight is always 20/20, but if I had to go back in time I would have skipped the Dawn of the Dead remake and just watched this one.  It manages to keep some of the thematic elements of the Romero trilogy while adding a bit of smart humor.  Zombification in this film has a physiological reason (which is hidden thanks to some well-timed channel-flipping) but on a subtle note zombification is a result of everyday routine -- societal norms that are pushed upon us and to which we conform.  The \\"zombie\\" by itself is slow, dumb, predictable and thus easy to kill.  They are only dangerous in large groups.  The same is true with any ideal to which one is tempted to conform.  One person usually cannot sway another individual, but a massive number of people doing one thing or thinking one thing may easily convince the nonconforming individual.  The so-called \\"Dawn of the Dead remake\\" completely misses this element of the zombie ethos by making fast zombies.  Shaun of the Dead, on the other hand, delivers on all levels: theme, gore, action and plot.  This is a wonderful British homage to Romero that just happens to be pretty funny.  <br /> <br />As for the DVD, the commentaries and interviews are some of the best out there.  The DVD is almost worth buying for the extras alone.  It is always fun when the director and/or writer is willing to open himself as such to the viewer.
0060005688|4.0|This book is a fast paced read, that starts out with a blizzard of examples concerning the bounty that modern society enjoys.  Despite that we live with this astounding abundance of material riches, we still feel unfulfilled.     The author then delves into the psychology behind why we feel discontent. Some interesting concepts are introduced.  I found that the idea of adaptation,  whereby we soon take for granted what was a highly desired entity before we possessed it,  and the way to counteract it, particularly fascinating.  His discussion of satisficers and maximizers resonated with me, too. Although on this type of personality difference,  I don't think the author could offer an easy remedy.  It's hard to start accepting something that's just 'good enough', when your the kind of person that prides yourself on knowing all about the very best things. But the author succeeds in developing a new perspective for us.  Then it's up to us individually to build on that perspective and figure out what it would take to make each of ours life more meaningful.  The book is enlightening and entertaining.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I saw this movie last year and fell in love with it.  It is a great movie for Christmas, with warm fuzzies, Christmas carols and doing things \\"just because its Christmas.\\" <br /> <br />The movie follows a few different relationships as they progress around the Christmas holidays.  First loves, newly-weds, older married couple, new loves, friendships, loves lost, and doomed loves are all in the story line.  It is a little complicated at some points, jumping from character to character, but watch it a second time and you'll catch  more things.  I love the fact that you can watch it over and over and each time find some new angle or idea that you overlooked the first time around.  There is some nudity and profanity which explains the R-rating it was given.  Hence, it is not a movie for young children.  The soundtrack picked out is perfect for this movie and follows beautifully with the storyline.  The large array of highly talented actors and actresses makes this a top-rate movie. <br /> <br />What I really love about this movie is that not everyone \\"gets the girl\\" in the end.  Everyone does not get their happily ever after, but this is what makes the movie more believable and more applicable to the title.  \\"Love Actually\\" is all around us.
B00005JN0T|4.0|I have to admit I didn't expect much from \\"I, Robot.\\" <br /> <br />The film is inspired by a collection of short stories written by Isaac Asimov, one of the literary giants of the Science Fiction genre.   Anyone who has read Asimov's work, knows that these tales were thought provoking, intelligent, and literate.    However, whenever the latest would-be blockbuster hits cineplexes trumpeting the phrase \\"starring Will Smith,\\" the words  \\"thought-provoking\\", \\"intelligent,\\" and \\"literate\\" don't exactly spring to mind. <br /> <br />Smith has, after all, built his career on starring in  movies that downplay the science in their fiction.    Judging from the pre-release trailers shown in theaters this summer, \\"I, Robot\\" looked to me like your typical big, dumb, loud Will Smith action movie.  Boy was I pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br />Yes, \\"I, Robot\\" features its fair share of chases, explosions, and big action set pieces but it never asks it viewers to park their brains at the door.  And, believe it or not, the movie IS thought provoking, intelligent, and literate.   At the same time, it also kicks ass. <br /> <br />Smith gives one of his best performances ever as Robophobic cop Del Spooner who patrols the not so mean streets of Chicago circa mid-21st Century. Yes, he is still basically playing the same cool brother who saved the world in \\"Independence Day,\\" the MIB movies, and the \\"Wild, Wild West\\" but here his swagger are tempered with an underlying sadness and bitterness that makes for a well-rounded character. <br /> <br />The movie also savors the delicious irony of an African-American cop who engages in a form of racial profiling against androids.   In one hilarious scene, he jumps what he takes to be a purse-snatching robot running down a street.   Turns out the robot had just fetched the item for his master. <br /> <br />The movie also boasts an exceptional supporting cast in Bruce Greenwood, who plays the head of  USR world's largest robot manufacturing firm, James Cromwell, a leading robotics professor whose apparent murder at the hands of a robot kicks off the story,  and Chi McBride as Spooner's commanding officer. <br /> <br />Also notable, is Bridget Moynahan, as Dr. Susan Calvin, another USR prof who winds up assisting Spooner in his investigation.   My only regret here is that the movie doesn't go all the way and let Spooner and Calvin wind up a couple.    By the end of the movie, she's giving him so many longing glances that you just know that had the Spooner role been played by say Colin Farrell or Ben Affleck, these two would wind up in bed before the credits roll.   But alas,  mainstream Hollywood movies still seem uncomfortable with the idea of interracial romance. <br /> <br />Also deserving a shout out is director Alex Proyas, a  who always brings a unique visual flair to his films.   Proyas previously directed \\"The Crow\\" and the underrated  \\"Dark City.\\"   Though last year's rock comedy \\"Garage Days\\" was something of a stylistic departure, \\"I, Robot\\" sees him back in the realm of the fantastic. <br /> <br />Though the film doesn't have quite the \\"wow factor\\" of his earlier work,   it's still good-looking enough to maintain his reputation as a visual genius. <br /> <br />\\"I, Robot\\"  probably won't appeal to die-hard Asimov purists,  many of  whom will likely view it as a bastardization of the great man's work.   But there's no getting around the fact that this is a fun movie that is smarter than the average blockbuster. <br /> <br />
B00000F5KH|4.0|From it's intriguing premise of a letter writer working in the main transit station in Rio who callously plays God with the hopes and aspirations of the illiterte working migrants she pens and pretends to send letters for, Walter Salles film starts as all journeys do - at the station. Such an unappealing character has probably not been seen since Ebenezer Scrooge graced Dickens' A Christmas Carol and like that story redemption comes ,not in the form of ghosts, but in the even more terrible apparition of an orphaned ten year old boy. This film is brilliantly told with a confidence and ease which is truly refreshing. The acting is uniformly superb and i would recommend this for anyone looking to try and understand that the gratest poverty in life is often that of the human spirit.
0767834739|3.0|Wow!  This is one case where I definitely wish that Amazon gave reviewers the option of rating both the film itself and the extras. <br /> <br />This is because while \\"Resident Evil: Apocalypse\\" is just a slightly above average sequel, the extras on this DVD offer hours of entertainment and are worthy of four stars on their own and maybe even five. <br /> <br />Let's start with the movie and some background on its history. <br /> <br />First, with the possible exception of snuff films, there is no film genre that commands less respect than that of the video-game based-movie.  <br /> <br />It's not without good reason either. If you think of the video game based movies you've seen, odds are they all s@#$ed majorly. \\"Super Mario Brothers\\"? Awful. Van Damme's \\"Streetfighter\\"? Mediocre at best. \\"House of the Dead\\"? Dumb.  <br /> <br />Which is why when \\"Resident Evil\\" appeared in theaters in 2002 it was something of a small miracle. Not only was the film not bad it was actually very good. Smart, sexy, stylish, \\"Resident Evil\\" was the rare video game film that transcended its roots to become a highly enjoyable movie-going experience for both diehard gamers and regular viewers.  <br /> <br />It also helped to revitalize the zombie movie genre, kicking off a resurgence of zombie and zombie-esqe films that began with \\"28 Days Later,\\" the new \\"Dawn of the Dead,\\" and the Brit comedy \\"Shaun of the Dead.\\"  <br /> <br />That trend continues now with \\"Resident Evil: Apocalypse,\\" which picks up right where the first film ended.  <br /> <br />The bad news? RE2 is not as good as it's predecessor. The good news? It's still pretty good.  <br /> <br />Returning for this installment is Milla Jovovich as Alice, sole survivor of the first film's series of events. Also, along for the ride is the luscious Sienna Guillory as S.T.A.R.S. officer, Jill Valentine, a name that will be familiar to fans of the \\"Resident Evil\\" video games. It's worth noting also that Guillory's resemblance to her videogame counterpart is so striking it's almost scary.  <br /> <br />Other game characters also make their appearances here although some fans may be dissappointed that they are not featured as prominently.  <br /> <br />Part of what made the first film work so well was the sure and inventive direction of Paul W.S. Anderson(\\"Mortal Kombat\\", \\"Aliens Vs. Predator\\"). Anderson's obvious love of video games seems to result in better than average film adaptations of them when he directs.  <br /> <br />Anderson didn't helm this installment but new director Alexander Witt still manages to pull of some solid and occasionally stunning action sequences in this film. The church standoff, involving Alice and a trio of Lickers is especially memorable. Ditto Alice's run down the side of a skyscraper near the film's climax.  <br /> <br />I'm only giving this film three stars though because it's flaws keep it from rising to masterpiece or even superb levels. Those flaws include:  <br /> <br />Poor attention to characters - Though \\"Resident Evil\\" also boasted an ensemble cast, the writing and direction there were sharp enough to ensure that certain characters emerged as standouts. This is not the case here, where the ensemble just isn't balanced properly. Even Jovovich and Guillory don't get enough screen time and they are supposed to be the stars.  <br /> <br />Not enough zombies - For a film that is supposed to be, at it's core, a zombie film, this movie offers far too few shots of the undead. When we do seem them they are often shot in shadowed, blurred slow motion.  <br /> <br />Mike Epps - Mike, I loved you in the \\"Friday\\" sequels but if you're not careful you're destined to wind up as the Trimspa version of fellow Black comedian-actor Anthony Anderson i.e. the go to guy when a movie requires an annoying Black comic sidekick. Note to Hollywood: If you want to include Black characters in mainstream films try to make sure that they're well-rounded and have depth instead of the sametired, loudmouthed stereotypes we've been seeing for generations.  <br /> <br />At least the movie explains why slim-framed Alice is able to pull off increasingly amazing feats of strength. Seems her exposure to the T-Virus is slowly evolving her to the point where she manifests superhuman powers. Where this storyline will take us, I have no idea.  <br /> <br />Now for the extras.  Simply put, this DVD offers an impressive array of special features that will keep viewers busy long into the night.  You get, three, count 'em three commentaries, 20 deleted scenes, a six-part making of feature, and host of other goodies that amount to everything AND the kitchen sink. <br /> <br />Most interesting is the feature on real-world corporate malfeasance.   Rarely does schlock entertainment actually try to make you think. <br /> <br />I also love the fact, that this DVD release contains both widescreen and full screen versions of the movie.  The ongoing trend of many studios releasing two different formats on separate discs fails to acknowledge many fans do like to have both versions and can't afford to shell out for the same DVD twice in order to have them. <br /> <br />While this is a great package there's no getting around the fact that the movie its wrapping is just a bit above okay.  In the end, I feel that movies like \\"28 Days Later\\" and the new \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" have raised the bar for zombie and zombie-like movies.  Anything coming afterward has really gotta step up its game.  \\"Resident Evil:Apocalyse\\" just didn't quite meet that challenge. <br /> <br />One thing I can say is that this film left me curious to see what happens in \\"Resident Evil 3.\\" And if Sienna Guillory comes back for that one, consider my advance ticket already bought.  <br /> <br />
0385513755|1.0|I got bored after 1/4 of the book. I learned a little about symbolism and it raised some question. But - the plot is like a script for a bad B-film.
B0006284JQ|1.0|She was cute and a novelty when she was young.  But Britney has aged very fast.  Her lack of a real singing voice has been apparent for some years now.  Like Britney Spears could even come close to Bobby Brown's rendition of My Prerogative.  If it weren't for tech/synch/amps and a great band she wouldn't be able to eek out the alphabet.
B00062ZE3U|5.0|As opposed to downloading it. We want this band to continue making music. I didn't think it was possible to top Mother Earth but I think they may have done it. There are very few bands in any genre that can produce music with such memorable melodies. Production is top-notch. This will be in my playlist for at least the next year.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I saw this movie just before I decided to move to the West Coast after breaking things off with my lover and quitting my job. I was fleeing from painful memories I was sure I could not handle. The movie haunted my every step. I decided to get on a flight back home and pleaded for my old position back and made up with my lover. It is two months later and we're very happy and this is turning out to be the best decision I have ever made. From what I read on this BBS, Oprah should do a show on how this movie has effected people in such a profoud way.

B00005JN0T|5.0|The movie `I, Robot' takes its cue from Asimov's collection of short stories by the same name.  It is not based on any one of the stories from the collection, choosing instead of add a newer tale still firmly establishing itself in the premise of the book:  The three Laws of Robotics.<br /><br />The three laws are: 1) A robot may not injure a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm. 2) A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.<br /><br />In this new visual tale, Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) has a deeply seated, personal prejudice against robots, saying himself that they are nothing but wires and lights.  When Dr. Alfred Lanning (the wonderful James Cromwell) unbelievably commits suicide, Spooner finds himself in an investigation that is not only tangled with conflicts against the laws of robotics, but also places his life in danger.<br /><br />Susan Calvin (expertly played by Bridget Moynahan) is a robot psychologist who finds Spooner's story ridiculous but detrimental to the impending release of the new NS5 robot series.  Together they capture Sonny, an NS5 that was present at the time of Dr. Lanning's death, and discover that he not only behaves in a manner peculiar to robots, but that he has dreams; something robots are not capable of.<br /><br />The plot takes off, with Spooner and Calvin searching for the meaning and the menace behind this aberrant behavior emerging in the new NS5's.  All Lanning left behind him was a \\"trail of bread crumbs\\", clues that Spooner must decipher, beginning with a copy of the Hansel And Gretal book left behind at the scene of his death.<br /><br />The special effects in this movie are stunning, sometimes going over the top but still blending in nicely with the futuristic theme.  What I found surprisingly unique and pleasing is that they used slow motion effects even in the CGI scenes, filming the robot fights in a way that has been done only with live actors before.  That was cool.  The buildings, the modes of transportation, the robots, the explosions, all were spectacular effects but did not overpower the theme of the movie or the talent of the cast.<br /><br />Will Smith brings his toughness and humor to the screen with his usual finesse, but to me it was Sonny the robot who captured the screen.  There was a great deal of chemistry between Spooner, Sonny, and Calvin, that balanced out the FX with human interaction and fine performances.  Adrian Ricard deserves a mention here for her role as Granny also, properly chastising the cocky Spooner in a way neither his Captain or Calvin could do.<br /><br />This is a great sci-fi thriller, and in my opinion, a great addition to one of the most classic books in science fiction to date.

B000002JOH|5.0|What other critics said about this C.D.:<br /><br />--Blender magazine included this in their \\"The 50 Greatest Rawk Albums of All Time\\" article and said it's \\"a brooding exercise in listener-as-punching bag, with Phil Anselmo's vocals a savage roar up against Dimebag Darrell's spiteful riffing.\\"<br />--Entertainment Weekly gave it an \\"A\\" grade, and said it's \\"undoubtedly one of the most satisfying heavy-metal records since Metallica's early-'80s cult days.\\"<br />--Q magazine: One of the \\"50 heaviest albums of all time.\\"<br />--Yahoo music: \\"With songs as catchy as they are powerful, Vulgar Display may be the group's all-around best album.\\"<br />--Napster (I couldn't agree more with this description): \\"A raw, pulverizing, insanely intense depiction of naked rage and hostility that drains its listeners and pounds them into submission.\\"<br />--Hit Parader magazine has several times listed \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\" in their \\"Top 100 Metal C.D.'s of All Time\\" list.<br /><br />Now, my review...:<br /><br />Pantera albums in order, from best to least best:<br />1. Vulgar Display of Power<br />2. Far Beyond Driven<br />3. Cowboys From Hell<br />4. Reinventing the Steel<br />5. The Great Southern Trendkill (it's still a good album, though.)<br /><br />Like Metallica, Pantera's sophomore effort was slower than their debut, 1990's \\"Cowboys from Hell,\\" but it was also much heavier and more mature. Pantera continued to release albums (which were increasingly heavy) over the next eight years, and every one of their albums is an epic, but this band shines brightest on 1992's landmark, \\"Vulgar Display of Power.\\" This album didn't completely abandon the band's thrash roots (it still showed thrash influence), so it should please \\"Cowboys from Hell\\" fans, but it will also definitely please fans of Pantera's newer, heavier, and somewhat slower metal. The guitar playing is just perfect; the riffs fly, but unlike some bands (i.e. Slayer), Dimebag plays slowly enough so you can absorb and enjoy one riff before another one comes.<br /><br />Calling \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\" the best metal album of the 1990's isn't an insult to Pantera's \\"Far Beyond Driven,\\" Metallica's \\"Black Album,\\" or Megadeth's \\"Rust in Peace,\\" but I truly believe this is as good as heavy music-- or any type of music-- gets. A lot of great metal came out of the 1990's, and \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\" is still, hands down, the best album of that decade. I don't understand how anyone, especially metalheads, can give it less than five stars. Even 4 or 4.5 stars is an injustice. It is at least a five star album. If you don't like this album, you don't like heavy metal! This C.D. is why I need a C.D. player. (As of July 2005) I have 350 compact discs, and \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\" is like the crown jewel of my collection. I almost consider it one of my prized possessions.<br /><br />If I could give only one or two albums five stars, \\"Vulgar\\" is one of those albums that would still get five. Mark my words, because I don't say this often, this album actually deserves more than five stars. It is a very catchy, brilliantly written, perfectly executed, and very heavy album that rivals \\"Master of Puppets\\" for the best metal album of all time. Every song on this album is a classic, timeless, very memorable hit, and every song is essential listening. Not one song (or a single second of a song) on this album is less than top-notch. You will find absolutely no filler (or anything close to it) here.<br /><br />Dimebag Darrel (R.I.P.) is, in my opinion, a modern day Jimmy Hendrix. He lays one big, talented riff after riff and one excellent, acrobatic solo after solo. Dimebag is, obviously, as good as or better than every other modern guitarist, but sometimes on this album (i.e. the song \\"Rise\\") it seems like he's even trying to out do himself. Plus, drummer Vinnie Paul's catchy, often complex drumming is always great and bassist Rex Brown is also at the top of his game, here. Finally, Phil Anselmo may not go down as one of the all time greatest singers, but no one can yell or snarl better than he, and his wailing voice is outstanding against the background wall of instruments. Plus, Phil actually does some real singing on here (i.e. \\"This Love\\" and \\"Hollow.\\")<br /><br />Pantera were a modern day Black Sabbath. They were a brutal,  no frills band with a sound all their own. They never made the same album twice, they were never trendy, never flavor of the month, and never a band to go with the flow or care what other people think. They weren't doom metal, thrash metal, or death metal.  Pantera didn't make any type of music except straight up, anti-pop, heavy as heavy gets metal that stops just short of death metal. But their music stopped just short of doom, thrash, and death metal, so fans of those genres should be pleased with Pantera, as well. Actually, fans of any type of metal--except melodic or nu-metal--should be in love with this band.<br /><br />Dimebag Darrel, \\"Vulgar Display of Power,\\" and Pantera (in general) were as original, influential and innovative as anything else in music the 1990's. They might not have been the creators of heavy metal, but, in addition to being the pioneers of 1990's metal (and giving birth to modern metal bands like Lamb of God and Shadows Fall), Pantera also helped to keep metal alive. In the early '90's, when grunge rock was dominating the charts, heavy metal seemed to be dead; but bands like Pantera (and Prong and Megadeth) kept it alive.<br /><br />If you've ever wondered what it was like experiencing metal for the first time back in the 1970's, and if you wonder what it was like listening to Black Sabbath for the first time, do yourself a favor and get some Pantera. Next, if you believe every metal band goes through a sophomore slump, or if you've never heard a 100% perfect album (and truly grade-A metal), and you wonder what it sounds like, proceed directly to \\"Vulgar Display of Power.\\" Finally, I cannot recommend this C.D. to you more if you don't like modern music and have nostalgia for older metal.<br /><br />Highlights include:<br /><br />Everything! Every song song is a stand out!<br /><br />1. \\"Mouth for War\\" (3:56), the first single, includes a great opening riff which speeds up as the song goes along--as do the drums-- before falling into a surging groove. The vocals and guitars meld perfectly on this song (as they always do on this C.D.). \\"Mouth for War,\\" which debuted at number one on the Billboard music videos charts and also has some rhythmic drumming, is a good headbanger and VERY catchy. Rating: 20/10.<br />2. \\"A New Level\\" (2:57) opens with sound of glass shattering, then it Rex lays down some good bass riffs, but Dimebag again dominates the show, with more great, bludgeoning guitar licks and a four part guitar solo. Phil's vocals are harmoic, too; he repeats some heavy yells in the chorus. The only problem with this song is it's rather short. Rating: 10/10.<br />3. \\"Walk\\" (5:15) is one of Pantera's most famous songs, mostly due to the staccatto riff that runs through the whole song. This toe tapping riff is about as catchy as you'll ever hear, and the drum beat is mighty catchy too. (Drummer Vinnie Paul fills the space in between the riffs and makes the rhythm have that thumping sound.) The riffs stop only briefly, for a speaker shredding guitar solo (a solo that Guitar World magazine named one of the all time best.) And you'd be hard pressed not to shout along to the chorus (\\"RE!SPECT! WALK!\\") You're just not metal if you don't know this song. Rating: 19/10.<br />4. \\"F'in' Hostile\\" (2:49) is an amazingly fast and brutal song that you can almost feel exploding out of your headphones. It's a shame this song wasn't included on Pantera's Greatest Hits album, because it's another fan favorite and one of Pantera's most famous tunes. Rating: 20/10.<br />5. \\"This Love\\" (6:32) gives the listener the first bit of relief. It's actually a semi-ballad, with almost \\"haunting\\"riffs and clean vocals in the beginning and verses. The lunging shout-along choruses, which have buzzsaw riffs, are still brutal, though, and they make this song another classic. Lyrically, this song is about a relationship gone awry. Rating: 15/10.<br />6. \\"Rise\\" (4:36) begins with guitar playing that's even more fast and brutal than \\"F'in' Hostile.\\" Plus, after like the first ten seconds, it shifts to an even higher, faster gear. Guitarists everywhere must be driving themselves crazy, trying to match Dimebag's insane, piledriving, blistering, scorching guitar work, on this song. And when Phil's vocals begin, the song becomes extremely catchy. The beat almost bobs in places, and you'll have this chorus--which is mosh worthy--running through your mind all day. The real highlight here, though, is the guitar solo. It's one of my favorite guitar solos of all time, and is definitely my favorite Dimebag solo. It builds like a skyscraper (it just builds and builds, then builds some more.) This moment and this moment alone made me want to pick up and learn the guitar. (Though I don't know why I'd even bother trying, because no one can top Dimebag.) Rating: 20/10.<br />7. \\"No Good\\" (4:50) has a riff which builds and gains speed like a snowball going downhill. Phil's vocals again go from supple growling (in the beginning) to yelling (in the unforgettable chorus). Another wailing guitar solo is included, as well as a killer ending of thumping riffs which echo Sepultura. Rating: 13/10.<br />8. \\"Live in a Hole\\" (4:59) has a guitar solo that's so close to the start, this song almost begins with it. Dimebag then turns the riff into a riff that goes up and down throughout the whole song. A shorter guitar solo is included (Pantera always had great solos) and the song ends with Anselmo whispering. Rating: 10/10.<br />9. \\"Regular People\\" (5:27) is another great and unforgettable anthem. The guitars and drums begin by pounding the same beat (\\"boom boom boom boom\\"), which builds as if it's running up a hill, then levels out. What really makes this song catchy, though, is the chorus. Every time I listen to this part of the song, I have it running through my mind all day. Rating: 15/10.<br />10. \\"By Demons be Driven\\" (4:39) might be my favorite song on here (and that's saying a lot!) It begins slowly with (what sounds like) the amplifiers turning on. My air guitar fingers itch again, all throughout this song. When I hear the part where Phil whales \\"by demons be driven\\" (over the great riffs), I pause the C.D. and think one of two things: either \\"Oh yeah!\\" or \\"God, I love metal!\\" Another high point of this song is the ending. Most of the songs on here usually end about the same time that the vocals are done, but here the guys keep playing (for like a minute another minute.) More excellent, choppy riffs and almost machine gun hand drums, here. Every band member plays power chords/notes. Rating: 20/10.<br />11. \\"Hollow\\" (5:45) is the other semi-ballad. The first half of this song adds good melody and texture to the C.D.; but the second half of the song is still metal (which no one does better than Pantera.) Shortly after the second half of this song begins, it turns to an irresistible bobbing beat. Phil's howl rides this beat well, too. If, when you hear this part of the song, you don't bang your head and stomp your foot, there's something wrong with you. Rating: 13/10.<br /><br />Total running time and length: 11 tracks, 52 minutes and 50 seconds.<br />Total rating: 175/110. An A++++++.<br /><br />Fastest/heaviest song: \\"Rise\\"<br />Slowest/lightest song: \\"Hollow\\"<br />Best song: \\"By Demons Be Driven\\"<br />Worst song: Ha! EVERY SONG IS A HIT!<br /><br />I just can't say enough good things about this album! No album is more deserving of five stars, and \\"Vulgar\\" is one of those few albums that I would truly give more than five stars, if I could. I have listened to it a countless number of times over the five years that I have owned it, and I still can'tget enough of it. All metal bands strive to make an album as masterful as this, but to no avail!<br /><br />Pantera were a great band, so they (of course) always made great C.D.'s. But this is great even for them! \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\" is definitely the sound of Pantera (and heavy metal in general) in tip-top form, and it's like a greatest hits album in itself! If I ever start to cool down on heavy metal or Pantera, or if I ever want to listen to any other genre besides metal, I just plop this C.D. in and I instantly remember all of the reasons why I love heavy metal. If you ever liked Pantera (or heavy music--death metal, thrash/speed metal, extreme metal, etc.), you owe it to yourself to buy this album. In fact, buy two copies, just in case you wear the first one out.<br /><br />It's well over a decade old now, so the sound quality has dipped slightly, but (other than that) everything is perfect and rates at least a 10 out of 10:<br /><br />--Songwriting: 20/10.<br />The music is (obviously) no less than brilliant, but the lyrics are also very good. Sometimes in metal, the lyrics can be a bit cheesy and contrived. That isn't the case, here. These lyrics are fit for heavy metal, but they are also not overly evil or tough.<br />--Sound quality: 9/10.<br />As previously mentioned, the sound quality has dipped slightly because it is over a decade old. I'd like to see this album re-released in a few years, but as of now, \\"Vulgar\\" still sounds great and is still mighty loud.<br />--Mixing: 10/10.<br />It wouldn't make me cry if the basslines were a tad bit more audible, but when the final product sounds like this album, you can't complain. But it isn't all just guitars and vocals; the drum work is still very audible.<br />--Musicianship: 20/10.<br />What can I say that I haven't already said? \\"Vulgar\\" has musicianship which is nothing short of mindblowing (and some of the best ever guitar work). if you're a young guitarist looking for some inspiration, you need to get this album,) and very deft, nimble, and catchy drumming. If you want to make a C.D. of songs with the best riffs/solos/music, don't bother making a mix C.D.; just buy this C.D.!<br />--Vocals: 15/10.<br />As aforementioned, Phil's voice goes perfect with the instruments. His voice is very catchy and he nails every hook and Phil is at just the right volume on this album (loud, but not too loud--he doesn't over dominate). He can wail, yell gutturally, switch to staccato barks, growl, and even whisper.<br />--Listenability/consistency and repeated listenability: 20/10.<br />Since this C.D. is all killer and no filler, it is completely listenable if you like heavy music. And the guitar solos alone make it worthy of repeated listens. I've listened to this C.D. a countless number of times, and I will listen to it countless more.<br />--Originality: 20/10.<br />On this album, you will find traces of Black Sabbath, Slayer, and even a little bit of Helmet. But every band has influences. Pantera took those influences and really turbo-charged them (they, as Vinnie Paul says, \\"added a Texas-sized twist.\\") That twist made all the difference; the result is one of the most original sounds you'll ever hear in heavy metal. If this C.D. sounds a little familiar now, it's only because a lot of bands have tried to copy it. Pantera made this sound first, and this sound was one of the most influential of all time.<br />--Album length: 10/10.<br />It's only eleven tracks deep, but it's 51 minutes long, and that's just the right length. Long, but not so long that you get tired of it or you have to listen to it in more than one sitting. \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\" is very addictive and I always feel like listening to it, but it's long enough that you don't have to savor it and you'll be satisfied for a long while after listening it, so you won't have to press the 'PLAY' button as soon as the C.D. is over.<br />--Production: 10/10.<br />Terry Date is famous for a reason. He is an excellentproducer. He has produced everything from Soundgarden to White Zombie and Deftones. This album is anything but overproduced, but it's not under produced, either. It never sounds muddy, it is always crystal clear. Every chord Dimebag plays is as brisk as the last. It's not just the musicianship--the production helps \\"Vulgar\\" to have the impact that it does. The production has also helped make this album stand the test of time. Even over a dozen years after its initial release date, this album doesn't sound at all stale. 10/10.<br />--Order of the songs/mastering: 10/10.<br />Mastered by Howie Weinberg, this track listing is in just the right order. It starts out with a killer song like \\"Mouth for War,\\" and it continues to gain momentum for the rest of the 10 songs. Some songs like \\"This Love\\" are thrown in at just the right place to make sure this album doesn't become monotonous, but there the very next song (\\"Rise\\") is an onslaught that tears your head off and makes sure that \\"Vulgar\\" keeps you on your toes and isn't at all predictable.<br />--Cover art: 10/10.<br />The cover art (a picture of a man being punched in the face) is worth mentioning because it's a truth in advertising (it describes this C.D. well).<br /><br />Pros: Everything<br />Cons: Like all good things, this C.D. eventually has to come to an end.<br /><br />You might think I'm over hyping this C.D. You might be thinking \\"it can't possibly be that good.\\" Well, my friend, it is! If I am sure about one thing in this life, it's that \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\" is as great as I'm saying it is--if not greater. If you don't take my word for it, let's look at the facts: Pantera have sold over 8 million records total, \\"VDP\\" debuted at number 44 on the charts and number 64 on the UK charts. Plus, as of 2004, \\"Vulgar\\" has sold over two million copies in the US alone. Can all those people be wrong about this album?<br /><br />Now, obviously, metal isn't everyone's favorite genre, so I can't really recommend this to anyone who loves music. But, if you're a metalhead, you should definitely already own this C.D., and if you're new to metal, make this one of your first purchases, because no metal collection is complete without all eleven of these songs. If you're a metalhead (or even a casual metal fan), I don't recommend you buy this album...I require it.<br /><br />Buy this album, if:<br />--Let me make this easy for you. If you like heavy metal--even a little bit--and if you've EVER liked metal, you owe it to yourself to buy this C.D..<br /><br />Don't buy this album, if:<br />--You like predictable, slow, boring, bloated radio songs.<br />--You're so broke, you can't even afford food (and if that's the case, then find someone who has this C.D. and burn it).<br />--You already have it.<br />--You're a Dave Matthews fan and/or you think Linkin Park is heavy.<br /><br />If you don't have a C.D. player, get one! And even if you don't like Pantera, you've got to give them props for making one of the most influential heavy metal albums of all time.<br /><br />--It's best to play this C.D. when:<br />You're trying to get pumped up<br />You want to know what a perfect album sounds like<br />You want something to renew your faith in metal<br />You're hanging with friends<br />Whenever!<br /><br />--Don't play this C.D. when:<br />You're trying to be romantic.<br /><br />If I could wrap all of this up and describe my love for this album in one sentence, it would be that IT IS MY FIRST OR SECOND FAVORITE C.D. OF ALL-TIME, IT IS DOUBTLESSLY PANTERA'S ALL-TIME BEST C.D., AND THE BEST METAL ALBUM OF THE 1990'S, AND IT HAS MY VOTE FOR THE BEST HEAVY METAL ALBUM EVER!<br /><br />Take my advice (you'll thank me later) and believe me when I say this: it is more than well worth the 15 bucks you'll pay for it. In fact, how can you even put a price tag on an album like this? The 15 bucks you spend here will be one of the most wise investments you will ever make. You will never regret buying \\"Vulgar Display of Power.\\" It is nothing short of genre bearing, career defining, standard setting, chart topping, era influencing, imitation inspiring, speaker shredding, ear pleasing, satisfying (actually \\"satisfying\\" is an understatement), virtuoso displaying, flattening, pummeling, blinding, jaw dropping, exciting, punishing yet highly rewarding, pulverizing, genuine, energetic, intense, powerful, deft, precise, brilliant, addictive, brutal, intense, exhilarating, memorable, super catchy, cathartic, caustic, contagious and infectious, consistent, innovative and original, timeless, essential, raw, crystal clear, mosh worthy, hostile, masterful, wonderful, phenomenal, an instant classic, 100% incredible, and completely and utterly flawless.<br /><br />It's the best album of the year (1992), the best album of the decade (the 1990's), the best album of the century...THE BEST ALBUM EVER!lay of Power\\" is definitely the sound of Pantera (and heavy metal in general) in tip-top form, and it's like a greatest hits album in itself!

B00005JNBQ|4.0|If you are looking for overt, laugh aloud humor, then you will be disappointed in Napoleon Dynamite.  Any real verbal or visual humor is very deadpan and subtle, and hard to miss if you are seeking out a belly laugh.<br /><br />The funniest part of the entire movie is the characters themselves, who go beyond nerd into the land of dweebs so inept that they are the ones that pass beyond the notice of society.  They are not handsome or beautiful, they are not smart, they have no talents, they are not social, and they are not even gifted with humor or likeable personalities.  They quite literally have absolutely nothing going for them except an exchange of oxygen and an ability to ambulate.<br /><br />There is Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) who is a skinny, slack open-mouth-breather with frizzy orange hair and pants worn so high they look like they are eating him.  He is sullen and caustic, making up ridiculous stories that make him seem more important.  He lives with his fast-living Grandmother (Sandy Martin) and his 32-year-old unemployed brother Kip (Aaron Ruell).  Kip is skinny, poorly dressed, distinctly stupid, and spends his entire day in chat rooms on his PC.<br /><br />Grandma gets injured while jumping her Quad over a sand dune, and sends Uncle Rico to watch the \\"boys\\".  Uncle Rico (played by Jon Gries) is an even older loser who lives in a hideous orange van, and constantly wishes he could time travel back to 1982 to change the outcome of a football game that he believes would have made him famous.  He makes his living doing door-to-door sales of everything from Tupperware to bust-enhancers.<br /><br />Don't forget to watch this movie all the way to the end of the credits.  After the final credits, there is another entire scene to watch that you won't want to miss.<br /><br />Napoleon Dynamite is well acted and well filmed, but is more a study in human ineptness rather than an outright comedy.  I would have liked to have seen more of Grandma in the movie, I believe she could have brought a little action and a few more laughs to the film.  Over all, not bad, but not good either.  My preference would have been to give it only 3.5 stars, but gave `Napoleon' the benefit of the doubt.  Recommendation: rent, don't buy.ction and a few more laughs to the film.  Over all, not bad, but not good either.  My preference would have been to give it only 3.5 stars, but gave `Napoleon' the benefit of the doubt.  Recommendation: rent, don't buy.
0596007124|5.0|As another reader said, GoF is the best book on patterns. Sure. It is THE book. And if you can pick it up off the shelf without knowing anything about patterns to begin with, and read more than a chapter without falling asleep, my hat's off to you. If you are a normal human being though, this is the book you want to start with. Head First will get you up and running, and understanding what patterns are, and actually get you excited about using them. When you finish this, GoF might not be so painful.
B00007LTIL|5.0|The point of the Dead, of course, is their live shows. When the band was on their game, there was nobody better on earth. I've been a Deadhead for twenty years, and although there are an awful low of sloppy shows out there, there are also lots of recordings available online, for free, of shows that will make you laugh out loud, they're so good. For example, if you're a newbie, go to archive.org and download the Barton Hall show from 1977. <br /> <br />The Dead were not, however, a studio band. Free-form jamming and stuff like learning to play the slide guitar onstage did not mix well with studio work. Except for here. This album contains some of their finest songs, carefully rehearsed, beautifully played, and stripped down. The music is deceptively simple, which you can only pull off if the songwriting is really strong. This is.  <br /> <br />And the music is haunting. If you ever had a dream, or were a child, or spent any time alone, or remember, this music will enter you and will not leave, ever.
B00005JMJG|5.0|This film is simply amazing. Please ignore any review of less than four stars. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are superbly cast in this brilliant love story. Director Michel Gondry is nothing less than a genuis in his treatment of this story by the great Charlie Kaufman. Even though the premise is about a new technique to erase memories the film resonates with reality. You will identify with the complexity of Joel (Carrey) and Clementine's (Winslet) relationship. The actors have a wonderful chemistry and convey their deep emotional attachment without alot of sappy dialogue. Jim Carrey has never been better. I realize that his hyperactive (sometimes maniacal) personality is what first garnered him fame but he really shines when he forces himself to reach inside for a quieter performance. There has been glimmers of this ability in alot of his films -- this man needs to do more serious, dramatic work! This film is hard to categorize -- comedy, drama, dramedy? I just prefer to call it REAL. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry but best of all it will make you think. If you enjoy intelligent, well-crafted cinema run, don't walk, and purchase this DVD. I will treasure my copy and I will recommend it to everyone!
B00005JN0T|4.0|First of all, I haven't read Isaac Asimov's \\"I, Robot,\\" so I don't have any basis on which to compare the book to the film.  However, I have watched many science fiction flicks.  I enjoy adventures such as the original \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy, action flicks like the recent \\"Resident Evil:  Apocalypse,\\" and the type of sci-fi that leaves you in a reflective mood, such as \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\\"<br /><br />I expected \\"I, Robot\\" to lean towards the \\"Resident Evil\\" genre of sci-fi.  Plenty of shoot'em up action and brainless explosions that are good for a Sunday afternoon, but won't expect you to think too much.  Add to the fact that Will Smith is in the starring role, and I expected the action to be hopped up on streetwise, smarty-pants humor.  Imagine my surprise when, after viewing the film, I was amazed at how really good this flick is.<br /><br />Granted, it is full of fast-paced action that any Playstation fan would jump with glee for, but it also has a really great murder mystery aspect to it that leaves you questioning just who the bad guy really is.  Also, Smith's token smart mouth is toned down a little, and I actually enjoyed watching him on the screen.  He seems to have finally matured into an adult, and his face is finally showing a little age, which makes it easier to believe in him as a toughened cop.<br /><br />The story starts out with Smith's character, Spooner, investigating the murder of a brilliant scientist responsible for introducing personal robots into society.  These robots provide companionship, do manual labor, and serve as all-around go-to's when needed.  Of course, Spooner believes this reliance on robots is only the beginning of something horrible down the road.  He immediately suspects one of the newest robotic creations to be the murderer of the good doctor.  He, along with a fellow employee of the deceased doctor, goes out to find who or what did the deed and why they did it.  What follows is a quickly paced action film that has plenty of intelligence for the viewer with an I.Q. above the average moviegoer.<br /><br />The story does start out somewhat slow, but it picks up about thirty-minutes in on both the action and intellectual levels.  Don't worry, you can still watch this as a brainless flick, but its story is so good that you'll be hard pressed not to follow it.<br /><br />The special effects are fun to watch.  It is amazing how life-like the robots are.  Sonny, the murder suspect, manages to win over even the toughest critics with his human emotions and actions.  I forgot that he wasn't real while watching the movie, making this story that much easier to digest.<br /><br />The DVD itself is sparse on extras.  There is a little \\"making of\\" documentary and a stills gallery.  There's also a commentary provided for those folks who have nothing better to do.  Honestly, I glance at some extras on DVDs, but I hardly look at them more than once.  If you're like me, you won't miss the movie trailers, cast filmographies, or other fluff that is sometimes put on these discs.  I buy these things for the films on them, not to learn why certain scenes are left on the cutting room floor.<br /><br />In closing, buy this flick if you like intelligent murder mysteries with a twist.  If you like sci-fi flicks in general, this movie won't let you down.  If you're an action fan, this motion picture has plenty of that, too.<br /><br />Highly recommended.m that has plenty of intelligence for the viewer with an I.Q. above the average moviegoer. <br /> <br />The story does start out somewhat slow, but it picks up about thirty-minutes in on both the action and intellectual levels.

B00006LI26|5.0|The first thing i got from this band was the JUDAS EP cassette with the songs JUDAS, VICTIM OF FATE, CRY FOR FREEDOM on side one and RIDE THE SKY and GARDIANS on side two (for some odd reason the songs listings on the cassette got revearsed) and i thought it was f*cking awesome. Not too soon after i got KOTSK part 1 and 2 and almost puked at the thought that this was Helloween, from going to thrash to cheesie, almost Queensryche(i hate that band)-like power metal, my interest in this band nearly died and i only listed too and treasured that E.P., hoping to find it and WALLS of JERICHO on cd somewhere. Well, i can tell you that WOJ is pure metal and not the stupid retard cartoon metal that this band would later become with KOTSK 1&2 and even worse on later efforts. This just rapes anyother Helloween album blindfolded because of it's agresivness and shred power, and on top of that you have Kai Hansen singing,  he has the freaking coolest, scaryiest, most ragged metal voice i have ever heard,so much better then Micheal Kiske, who is basically a metal version of Steve Perry (Journey), man, that guys singing is horrible!anyway, this album is freaking awesome to put it bluntly, not one bad track, you would never think that this was a debut album because it is so wwell done. make it one of the few metal albums you own.
B000002LSV|4.0|If you're like me and you enjoy hearing the hits on the radio but you only want to purchase one cd from ZZ Top, then Greatest Hits is your best bet. <br /> <br />It does omit some of their 70's material but at least \\"Tush\\" and \\"Cheap Sunglasses\\" made the cut. It focuses mainly on the 80's. You get all the MTV era hits such as \\"Gimme All Your Lovin\\", \\"Sharp Dressed Man\\", \\"Rough Boy\\" and a dance remix of \\"Legs\\" which i don't like as much as the original but I guess it will have to do. <br /> <br />And for you fanatics, this set does include 2 new songs, one of which being a remake of \\"Viva Las Vegas\\" which is actually pretty enjoyable. <br /> <br />The only complaints I have is they didn't include \\"TV Dinners\\" and \\"Burger Man\\" which are both very underrated tunes. <br /> <br />Don't hesitate to pick up this collection today at your local record store.
B00011F5DK|5.0|We play this game as a family from 6yrs to 40 yrs. It is one of my 6yr old's favorite games to play. She caught on real quick how to play it. My 8 year old always wins.One of the best games in a long time.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|This was an enjoyable family film. Between the gum eating scene, \\"For that Special Someone\\" and Buddy with his elf father, this movie is hilarious. I bought it when it first came out, and this is the kind of Christmas movie that you can watch anytime of the year.  <br /> <br />The only problem with this movie is the \\"love story.\\" Though sweet, it's a little sappy.  <br /> <br />But the relationship between Buddy and his biological family is sweet. The father, who isn't exactly accepting, the \\"mother\\" who loves the idea (though I wouldn't be happy if I found that my husband had fathered a son out of wedlock) and the little brother who is able to have fun once in his life. <br /> <br />If you enjoy great comedy, then you should give this movie a try. (The special features are great, also!)
B000002JSP|5.0|I have a lot of friends that listen to Led Zeppelin. They're used to Page doing ridiculous guitar solos and Plant singing blues and hard rock. But any REAL Zeppelin fan can see that this is a great album. Most people would take one listen to this and throw it down because of the keyboard, synth, and experimentational styles of music, such as Tex-Mex and Rockabilly. A REAL Zeppelin fan would learn to appreciate this album and not 'judge a book by its cover.'  <br /> <br />IN THE EVENING-An awesome opener with a minute long introduction. The hard guitar and vocals send your head to banging. Page uses an effect system called the 'Gizmotron' which makes his guitar sound like a crash of thunder or a loud slamming noise. 5 stars! <br /> <br />SOUTH BOUND SAUREZ-A finger-lickin' piano intro begins a Tex-Mex style song with great drums and guitar. It evens sounds like something you'd hear down in New Orleans. Page's guitar solo is erratic, yet awesome and Bonham has a great drum break at 3:25 into the song. 4 stars! <br /> <br />FOOL IN THE RAIN-A highly syncopated rhythm driven by the piano forces of John Paul Jones shows Zep could play any style of music. It finally gives way to a Samba rhythm with Bonham playing awesome drum riffs. Plant's vocals never sounded so good. One of the best on the album! 5 stars! <br /> <br />HOT DOG-A highly underrated song! Page begins a fast riff that sends the band into a toe-tappin' Rockabilly song that sounds like it comes off of an old-timey Country album. This is Led Zeppelin playing like a bar room band led by an itchy-fingered piano player. 4 stars! <br /> <br />CAROUSELAMBRA-A synth riff leads way to a 10-minute epic that shows no sign of stopping. Bonham plays very rapidly to a song that is very pre-80s rock. Could this be what Led Zeppelin would have sounded through the 80s? The lyrics are strange and incomprehensible and Page rolls out the Gizmotron to play some haunting guitar licks near the middle of the piece. Absolutely great! 5 stars! <br /> <br />ALL MY LOVE-A catchy pop piece that is not my most favorite but good all the same. Jones has an excellent synth solo and Plant uses great lyrics. 3 1/2 stars. <br /> <br />I'M GONNA CRAWL-Page drives this piece that is a 60s soul-blues ballad. Page's solo is that of a cocktail bar-type performance. One of the best vocal performances is given by Plant. This song proved to be Zep's Swan Song! 4 stars! <br /> <br />
B000006045|3.0|The vocals on \\"Rising Son\\", Mezzanine\\" and \\"Inertia Creeps\\" are absolutley atrocious. It amazes me that Massive Attack can reach such heights : \\"Angel\\", \\"Man Next Door\\" (both Horace Andy remakes from the 1970's) and \\"Teardrop\\" to the afore mentioned 3 disasters on one album. Obviously ego and yes-men allowed Del Naja to attempt to sing. The three triumphant racks nullify the disasterous vocals of the three tracks mentioned in the first sentance. Horace Andy is a master, Del Naja is a disaster.
B000062YB1|5.0|If you say slayer, most people think reign in blood. reign in blood was a masterpiece, but this, quite possibly in many ways beats it, as well as their other albums.In fact, it is well up there will the greatest metal albums of all time! <br /> <br />War Ensemble, the best slayer song ever is just as thrashy as raining blood, if not more, and has killer riffs and amazing lyrics. Then there's the title track, seasons in the abyss, and shows slayer can play both fast and slow,yet still have brutal drums from dave, with tom araya going from insane growls to medlodic singing. The other songs are great as well, with dead skin mask sounding very south of heaven like and expendable youth having a shown no mercy sound. <br /> <br />This is kind of like a compilation album from slayer, although featuring new material!It shows all their styles and skills, and that they are kings of metal!
B000021XS0|3.0|Ladies and Gentlemen, if you thirst for a true masterpiece in concept albums, may I suggest \\"Brave\\" by Marillion...that unbelievably resembles this CD.  Actually, I would venture to say that Marillion has grounds to sue on theft of intellectual property!!!! Trewavas and Portnoy have collaborated in the past...that would perhaps explain the exchange of ideas.  However, Scenes doesn't come close to Brave in its portrayal of pain and absolution.  Listen to Brave..and then you'll laugh at Scenes.  That is not to say that these guys are some of the most talented musical freaks on the planet!!!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|It is interesting to note that most reviews for Napoleon Dynamite are either fully positive or fully negative. I think this can be easily accounted for. The people who don't enjoy the movie don't seem to understand it, and aren't able to appreciate what makes this movie special. It's creative, goofy and flat out unique! You never know what to expect! <br />Hint: This movie is much better when watched with others! It adds to the fun!
B00009TB5G|5.0|I must say that I'm totally partial to all of the extended versions of LOTR when compared to the widescreen versions.  We can say it's all a marketing ploy and that it's not fair to the consumer in the way that they staggered the extended version releases but, even if that's true, the palatinum series are a must own.  In The Two Towers the extra scenes are outstanding.  We witness Merry and Pippen discovering Saruman's food stores which explains how they got to be sitting atop the wreck of Isengard eating and smoking at the start of the next movie.  The Stewards of Gondor scene where Boromir is being cheered by his men over the capture of Osgiliath is excellent and the rift between Denethor and Faromir is fleshed out deftly for the audience.  Furthermore, the viewer finds out, in this version, Aragorn's age and the special blood and people from which he descends.  The documentaries about Tolkien are superb and this installment on disc three is no exception; although, I will say that all the \\"making of\\" stuff holds little interest for me.
B0006213WG|5.0|After the release of Sum 41's record \\"Does this look infected?\\", released in 2002, people started to wonder how they're third record would be like. Being a fan myself, I feel the two long years wait were absolutely worth it. Sum 41's third album, \\"CHUCK\\", has everything you could demand music to be: good guitars, various melodies, energic drums and much more. Although they claim they are still the same, you can sense they've matured a lot not only as persons since they're lyrics reach issues by far more complex than the other albums, but also as artists experimenting with different melodies and instruments. If you like this band, you will definitively not want to miss this record; it's a 'must have' for all the Sum 41 fans and people who like this kind of music.
0380778556|3.0|Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca is narrated by a timid young lady, barely an adult, who is left alone in the world after the death of her parents.  Through fortuitous circumstances she meets Maxim de Winter, a wealthy widower and master of Manderley, a grand country house on England's coast.  When this young lady - we never learn her name - enters de Winter's world, she is inevitably compared to Rebecca, de Winter's former wife.  These comparisons, and the social demands placed on her in de Winter's world, accentuate her natural anxiety to the point that she begins to consider suicide.  At the same time, a maritime accident reveals much about de Winter, Rebecca, and Manderley itself.<br /><br />This novel explores some popular themes, like the troubles of fabulously wealthy people.  But popularity does not in this case imply mediocrity.  Du Maurier has created some wonderful characters, including the nameless protagonist, who is surely the heroine of shy people everywhere.  She also offers some pretty good plot surprises.  Finally, and very importantly for me, she offers some nice scenes of English domesticity (shaking off the water after a walk in the rain, reading the papers in front of the fire, having tea in the library, and so on).  Rebecca might be summer reading, but it is good summer reading.
B00003TL18|5.0|Every note is great whether it's sung or played by Roy and this wonderful cast.
0765310015|4.0|Steven Erikson, Gardens of the Moon (Bantam, 1999)<br /><br />Steven Erikson began his massive, seemingly unending Malazan Book of the Fallen series with Gardens of the Moon, a nine-hundred-plus page monstrosity published to some acclaim in Britain, but not on this side of the pond until 2004. This created almost a Cult of Erikson in the States, where its devotees, who often paid insane prices for imported mass-market paperbacks, watched us getting all het up over George R. R. Martin, Terry Goodkind, Robert Jordan, et. al., and gloated to themselves, knowing they had the real goods. Then came June 2004, and for the first time, Steven Erikson's Malazan books started being released domestically.<br /><br />In all honesty, while Gardens of the Moon doesn't have the stature (or resultant epic feel) of George R. R. Martin's truly never-ending A Song of Ice and Fire, it certainly does the trick well enough with this opening shot. To try and recount the many pieces of plot in a thousand-word review would be to demean the complexity and richness of the book. Just get it and read it for yourself.<br /><br />Erikson's characters are sometimes shallower than I'd like, but allowances must be made for this being, in essence, a book of setup; the characters do need room to expand. That said, he fills in a good deal on major and minor characters alike, and the novel does have enough characterization that the whole massive tome isn't just advancing the subplot that drives this first novel.<br /><br />The second book, Deadhouse Gates, is slated to be released in America in February 2005. Read this one before then so you don't get behind. *** ½
B000099T2L|4.0|Beyonce 1st solo efforts gives us a glimpse of what she is capable. This CD balances Upbeats, Mid-Tempos, and Ballads. <br />--Crazy In Love= The beat is crazy...very very energetic...the chorus is catchy...What made this song as hot as it was was the video <br />--Naughty Girl= Its sexy...the lyrics are lacking a little..but the vibe of this song is what makes it good. I get a Middle Eastern R&B feel <br />--Babyboy= The song is good..except for Sean Paul...the melody is different from anything Destinys Child had done..its hot tho <br />--Hip Hop Star= Its a weird song...its something that i play sometimes...but not all the time...kinda boring. <br />--Be With You= Love this song...its very suductive...it gives a 70s R&B A La 2003. <br />--Me, Myself & I=Best song on the CD. Its catchy the beat is hypnotic, the lyrics are tight...Its a type of song that really works for Beyonce. <br />--Yes= Wish this song woulda been a single, but it wasnt..its kinda like Me, Myself & I...catchy and ect.. but not as good. <br />--Signs= Boring...You'd think if she worked with Missy they'd come up with something Hot...but nope. <br />--Speechless= Suductive bedroom song...to long tho <br />--Thats How You Like It= Lyrics kinda corny...kind of a boring song. <br />--The Closer I Get 2 U= A Classic...good rendition. <br />--Dangerously In Love= beautiful song...but it was on Survivor.. she shoulda done something to it to make it her own. <br />--A Gift From Virgo= Its a sweet song...but the way the beat and the way its sung makes it boring <br />--Daddy= Nice tribute to her Daddy <br /> <br />This album is just a sneak peak of what shes capable of doing...her next project will be huge....but she needs to take some time out of the spotlight and take time making the next album...cuz the reason Destiny Fulfilled wasnt good was because it came to soon and not enough work was put on it..If she makes the same mistake again shes done.
B00000DHRX|5.0|George Michael is one of Pop's most versatile Artists and a true Survivor. It's no suprise then that \\"Ladies & Gentleman: The Best of George Michael\\" is an Annual Best Seller at Amazon the world over! The opening track on the \\"for the heart\\" CD1, \\"Jesus to a Child\\", is nothing short of stunning: \\"Sadness in my eyes; no one guessed, well no one tried; you smiled at me; like Jesus to a Child; loveless and cold; with your last breath you saved my soul; you smiled at me; like Jesus to a Child.\\" George does just a competent take of \\"I Can't Make You Love Me\\"; Bonnie Raitt's version is definitive. But he more than makes up for it with his own \\"Praying for Time\\", a song with a timeless message. CD2 \\"for the feet\\" contains all the mid and uptempo Dance/Pop Hits. Highlights include \\"Freedom 90\\" and \\"Faith\\". George's fans should also check out the new release from Pop/Rock Artist Amber - \\"My Kind of World\\". Amber's CD is an eclectic Collection of Pop, Rock, Jazz, and Dance Tracks. Though not a Greatest Hits Collection like George's CD, \\"My Kind of World\\" may as well be. It contains enough potential Singles to keep it in the Charts for the next 2 years! Billboard in it's glowing review of the CD said that \\"Amber deserves a spot in the Mainstream!\\". Right beside George! My advice? Get BOTH The Best of George Michael and Amber - My Kind of World.
B0002TT0NW|5.0|5 stars for the real Harry Potter on film. <br />Believe it or not, I have just seen it and I'm really excited that the Rowlingsque nature of the book saga appeared beautifully for the first time on screen. That was Hogwarts as it must have been in a cinematic edition. Subtle, mysterious, not superficial. Enjoyable stuff; the EXPECTO PATRONUM found its answer in Alfonso's directing
B00026WU3M|4.0|Somehow I had always overlooked this cd until I read Dylan's Chronicles book. In it he describes the sessions in New Orleans that resulted in this recording and I was intrigued since I could tell that Dylan was clearly pleased with this work. Well, the cd does not disappoint. Dylan's songs are solid with a couple of real standouts including Man in the Long Black Coat , Most Of The Time and What Good Am I. The sound mix is really something with the really moody echo/phaser effect on the guitars and when Dylan blows his harmonica,though sparingly, it cuts like a knife. This may not be on the same plane as some of his masterpieces lyrically but man the sound just knocks me out.
B00009P1O2|5.0|Being a Queen fan, I have most of the existing recorded concerts on DVD, such as We Will Rock You. Unlike in We Will Rock You, Freddie Mercury seems to have better voice control and doesn't just do the essence of the song, but more of the studio version. Not only does this recording have great songs that are rare and somewhat unknown, such as In The Lap of the Gods and Is This the World We Created, but many of the songs are from past generations and Queen's #1 hits. The second disk has detailed interviews with Roger Taylor and Brian May which are interesting to watch. A great buy for a new Queen fan, and of course the Queen collector.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|Got this for Christmas from family (upon my request).  Ever since DVDs were invented, I've hoped and prayed that this concert would be released.  And its finally here!    Yeah, yeah...its incomplete, the sound and picture aren't perfect, no Zeppelin, yadda yadda...    You know what?  I don't care!  I'm just thrilled to the bone to finally have a DVD copy of this show in my possession.  This was one of the most important music events in recent history (ever, actually), and it deserves to be remembered for what it was: a monstrous concert that occurred on 2 continents, that was logistically impossible to pull off (yet they did it!), and that raised money to feed people.  Rock on.    The Wembley concert is absolutely amazing.  In the first half, you see some great bands who never really got much exposure in America.  In the second half, you get Living Legend followed by Living Legend, giving some truly inspired and empassioned performances.  The portion of this show from U2 on seems timeless.      On the other hand, the JFK concert is a bit less solid, and definitely more dated.  Where the Brit show was pretty much a rock/pop concert with some timeless acts participating, the JFK show is a rock/pop/rap/dance/surf/soul/heavy metal/r&b concert with a lot of acts that failed to sustained a significant career.  The audience doesn't seem too 'into' everything either, whereas the Brits embrace every act that walks onto the Wembley stage like a lover.  Plus, some of the JFK acts seem completely out-of-place.  Like Kenny Loggins....huh????  And Patti Labelle....her performance is absolutely riveting, and I've always thought that she had one of the most incredible voices on the planet, but how did she get billed so high in the order?  And Madonna, doing the only two fully coreographed dance pieces, just looks silly.  However, I'm totally thrilled that they kept Bette Midler's introduction for her intact!    There are some clunkers in this, for sure.  I've always hated the Thomson Twins' version of \\"Revolution\\" because it sounded lifeless and Tom always sang it horribly flat.  But to see it here with Steve Stevens and Madonna...wtf?      I knew that the package was going to be truncated a bit, but for me personally, as long as the Queen and Bowie sets were intact, I'd be happy.  And fortunately, they are.  In fact, I'd completely forgotten that Queen did \\"Hammer to Fall\\", so its actually 'more complete' than I remembered!  On the other hand, I am terribly sad that the Hooters weren't included, for whatever reason.  I was a huge fan of them at that time.    Here are my highlights (arranged with the best at the end):    *Paul Young - always a terrific performer, and what a voice!  His songs....eh!  But I could listen to him sing about breakfast cereal and be happy.    *Patti Labelle - This woman's voice is awe-inspiring.  We only get her Lennon and Dylan covers here, but she makes them her own, injecting them with a passion and soul that is genuine and full of power    *Sade - what a sultry performer. Wish more of her set had been included on the DVD, but what we get is wonderful.    *Teddy Pendergrass - his first public appearance since the accident that left him a quadraplegic; an incredibly moving moment    *Dire Straits - The performance with Sting of \\"Money for Nothing\\" is terrific, as is their excellent \\"Sultans of Swing\\"    *The Pretenders - a terrific, feiry set from the American upstarts.  \\"Middle of the Road\\" rocks    *Mick and Tina - Mick's set was okay, but Tina joining him to perform \\"State of Shock\\" was a classic moment.  When they segued into \\"Only R&R\\", I was about over it.  And then there was that unecessary costume change.      *Eric Clapton - Okay, I'm not much of a Clapton fan, but his set at Live Aid was absolutely stellar!  I've watched it over and over again, and I simply can't get enough of it.  His performances of \\"White Room\\" and \\"She's Waiting\\" are extremely good, but the fire and energy of \\"Layla\\" is absolutely inspiring.    *Elton - \\"Rocket Man\\" absolutely soars; plus having Kiki Dee and George Michael singing with him was cool.  I remember the original broadcast; when they showed shots of his band, I kept thinking 'gosh, that sure looks like Kiki Dee singing back-up!'    *U2 - Their Live Aid appearance was on the cusp of U2 becoming global superstars, and I feel certain that this performance played a big part that transformation.  Bono certainly showed the world what a charismatic personality he is.  He seemed larger than life.    *BOWIE - This is Bowie in his leisure suit era, but the performance is high-energy, and its clear that the members of his hastily-assembled band are enjoying themselves immensely. Its fun to see Thomas Dolby as the keyboardist in the band.  And I'd forgotten how hot the percussionist is!  The songs are great (*very* fast tempos!), especially \\"Heroes\\", which is magnificent and inspiring, and the perfect inclusion.  It sends a chill up my spine everytime I watch it.  To me, this song sums up the entire Live Aid experience.  An absolutely 'heroic' performance.     *QUEEN - every minute is perfect.  I don't think there are very many times that you could say that a rock band held the entire world in its hands...but for 20 or so minutes, Queen did just that.  They literally walked out on stage owning the entire world and walked off stage having left it exhausted, exhilerated, and uplifted.  God Save the Queen.  \\"We Are the Champions\\" takes on new meaning.    *The Band Aid finale - Brings me to tears everytime I see it.      A hearty 'thank you' to all the folks who were involved in creating this DVD, and to those who made the concerts and the original broadcast possible.      [UPDATE: Its now been three months since I originally wrote this review (at the end of December). In that time, I've watched these DVDs at least once each week, sometimes two or three times.  Its THAT good.  I simply cannot get enough of it.  If you've not bought it, please do.  Feed the world.]

B00005B36H|2.0|I think AEnima is a really terrific album, five stars all the way, and I really like the first Perfect Circle CD, but this disc I just did not like. I know that's not a popular position, but this disc just lacks the great wicked hooks and action of earlier Tool/APC stuff.  I like my rock albums to, you know, actually ROCK. And this album simply does not. <br /> <br />It's like Tool started to read and buy into their press clippings; it's contemplative, self-indulgent art rock, almost totally edgeless. Because I liked AEnima so much, my expectations were high and this disc just completely disappointed me.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|Lost in Translation is best viewed without preconceptions or expectations: indeed, i first became aware of this film upon entering the cinema in which it was showing, and my experience benefited from that fact immensely. <br />it is not a humorous film. it is not even nearly funny, and especially not so on the rare occasions when it tries to be. <br />the devil of this film is all in the details. the cinematography is beautiful, and sophia coppolla conveys the minutiae of the film's core emotional content wonderfully. a special mention is also deserved for the fantastic 'soundtrack' provided by 'that guy from My Bloody Valentine'', which accentuates the ethereal and dreamlike states of Bill and Scarlett's characters.  <br />what i found to be particularly intriguing was the concept of a 'small romance' that this film centres around. the two main characters both know on some level that nothing can really become of their relationship and that, were it not for the necessity imparted by their situation in tokyo, they almost certainly would never have occasion to explore one-another so profoundly as they do during their stay: lethargy has gripped the pair far too much for them to find anything but a temporary, though incredibly meaningful, meeting of souls. the film conveys an unconventional - yet very real, very heartfelt and thought-provoking modern romance.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|This film could possibly go down as the greatest film on teenage detachment ever made. If Hollywood could ever get their act together and make an adaptation of [[ASIN:0316769177 The Catcher in the Rye]], we might actually have another contender, but as it stands currently, and barring all the false starts and problems the aforementioned project seems to be cursed by, Donnie Darko may just be the last word. At best, this really is a genre splitting debut feature about time travel, alternate dimensions, [[ASIN:B000PGC4TO Castanedian]] Philosophy and even an introspection into the true nature and place of those would-be personalities, the Smurfs. At worst, it's the greatest contribution the Emo sub-culture to date, out-stripping The Cure.<br /><br />I've seen this movie a few hundred times now, and if you knew me you'd probably understand that it's not that strange of a boast at all for me to say it. I currently own three different versions of this and have sifted the contents and commentaries of all of them. The Original Theatrical Release, The Director's Cut (White Box) and the Region 2, UK Release (Black Box with hologram). So far, my favorite is the Original Theatrical release and for the following reasons.<br /><br />1. Richard Kelly tells the viewer in both versions of the Director's Commentary that he could never get clearance or the money for the songs he wanted to do the film with originally and was `forced' to change some of the music after he toured the film with festival rights. Well ... in all honestly, it was probably for the better that he didn't have the money. I can't bear to watch the film start with the alternate music. Echo and The Bunnymen's `The Killing Moon' is a perfect and very haunting opus-like opening to the film that should have never been messed with in retrospect, regardless of whatever came before it. Tampering with it in such a way is like taking `As time goes by' out of Casablanca, which Michael Curtiz and Jack Warner would've done had Ingrid Bergman not cut her hair and been unavailable to do reshoots and pick-ups.<br /><br />2. The fireworks at the end is superfluous and a bad choice of visual effects to have man-handled inappropriately into the film. It comes off as a thuggish way to treat the original, without doubt. The eyeball visual and the ocean waves are interesting and seem to fit the tone, but anything after that is just grasping at amateur theatrics.<br /><br />3. While I do appreciate the additional scenes and the on-screen text of `The Philosophy of Time Travel', it does add to the film, but with the other two mentioned points and the shifting of key music, it negates whatever is gained by the on-screen text.<br /><br />I remember when Donnie Darko was released and was being advertised with the ad campaign posters all over Hollywood. They were able to secure the large billboard on the corner of Fairfax and Hollywood Blvd and I remember thinking: `Wow, what an odd looking poster. What the hell is that all about?\\" But I never saw a trailer once.<br /><br />The ad campaign this film received was atrocious to say the least and it was no fault at all of the filmmakers or flower films, but a direct failure of 20th Century Fox executives who didn't really know what to do with this, even though teen horror was the biggest grossing money-makers in the business at the time. All they needed to do was just advertise it and let the masses decide to go see it. Typically though, almost every modern classic has been panned or mishandled and sometimes this just adds to the beauty and the lore that follows the film ever after.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the film hit theatres in limited release (LA, NY) just a week and half before 9-11, and much like David Fincher's [[ASIN:B000069HZP The Game]], which was sunk by the death of Princess Diana, Donnie Darko suffered an equal fate and quietly slipped out of theatres robbing Kelly of the immediate notoriety he should have garnered and does deserve. To be fair though, Kelly does have a pretty unstable reputation as a filmmaker and a Howard Hughes ala [[ASIN:B0002MHE1O Hell's Angels]] type of aura regarding his movies. [[ASIN:B0011VIO3W Southland Tales]] took much longer for Kelly to get out and into theatres than was ever needed, and he pretty much spent the 00's working on one film, where his peers put out 3,4 and 5 films, even with Tony Scott taking him under his wing. Work ethic is probably not the problem, but writing and post-production tinkering seems to be his Achilles heel.<br /><br />Donnie Darko will surely be remembered as his masterpiece. For several years the film had successfully supplanted and pushed out midnight viewings of [[ASIN:B00004U8P9 The Rocky Horror Picture Show]] and their antic driven followers, for the much more morose Donnie Darko and the coffee-clatching style of discussion that often followed afterwards. Having attended both of those in my life, I do not elevate one over the other but enjoyed both equally.<br /><br />Everything about the Theatrical Release of Donnie Darko is pure magic and the stuff of great filmmaking. Kelly's writing here leaves just enough for the viewers imagination without spoon-feeding and raises enough questions to cause a prolonged dilemma.<br /><br />... ...n as a filmmaker and a Howard Hughes ala [[ASIN:B0002MHE1O Hell's Angels]] type of aura regarding his movies.

B00013RC8O|5.0|I first saw this movie at a drive-in back in 1971 playing along w/ The French Connection. From that moment on, I was a Vanishing Point and Dodge Challenger fan.     In quick summary, the movie details a contract car driver named Kowalski (no first name given) who makes a bet that he can drive his 'hopped up to over 160' 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T from Denver to San Francisco in 15 hours.    We find through flashbacks that Kowalski was once a motorcycle and auto racer, an ex-cop as well as in the military. We also learn that His wife drowned while surfing.    Along the way of being chased by cops on motorcylces as well in other MOPARS, he is challenged to a hi-speed race with a jaguar, gets some much needed gasoline from some 'Jesus people' in the desert, is aided by a blind disc-jockey named 'supersoul' (Cleavon Little) and others along the way to avoid the police, all leading to the climatic ending.    The UK version which is on the 'B' side of the DVD has an extra scene with Charlotte Rampling.    Since Dodge has started producing the Challenger again, I wonder if a 'reboot' of the movie will soon follow.
B00003CXCT|5.0|It's amazing. I have both sets now (VHS and DVD-4dcWS) and each holds it's own attraction. As I stood in line, so long ago (and in a galaxy far, far away) I still remember how awe-struck I was in just being there. It felt as if I knew that this was something extremely special. And that it was going to be one of those things that live forever. Yes, I still have the pin that was given out upon entrance (May the Force Be With You). And it still shines in it lovely black and silver. However, I digress. I have cherished the VHS trilogy and now, I savor in the DVD-4dcWS. Contrary to what has been said about zapping the memory and affection of the \\"real\\" movie... I found that George Lucas, et al, gave the hardcore Warer's a little extra present. Keep your VHS, by all means, but for added pleasure, a little more story and, in my own personal opinion, a better ending (because it now ties into the pre-quel) the DVD-4dcWS is a must have.
B000068CNX|5.0|Hello! <br /> <br />I live in Hungary, and I bought the DVD in Hungarian. I love Friends, so i love the dvd. But I have a problem. In Hungary there are no extras on the dvd, and I found on the Internet that on the American DVD I can watch the Smelly Cat Video Clip, but it is NOT on my DVD. Can anybody help me and send me the video or its soundtrack? Or do you know any places to download it from? <br /> <br />PLEASE help me!! <br /> <br />PS: my email is hann@citromail.hu
B0000057C5|5.0|Ok. I got this album as a christmas gift, and I just can't get over  it. This is actually my third album from rammstein, with reise, reise and herzeleid being my first two. From the beginning to the end of this album, its like im in another world. <br /> <br />Sehnsucht - 10/10 - Awsome riff. <br /> <br />Engel - 10/10 - Nice and slow. <br /> <br />Tier - 100/10 - My favorite song on the album. <br /> <br />Bestrafe Mich - 9.5/10 - Not bad. Theres room for improvement though. <br /> <br />Du Hast - 8/10 - Most people adore this song. I dont see whats so special about it. Its still a very good song, just not as much as the others.(it would be alot better if people werent trying to translate it all the time...) <br /> <br />Bck Dich - 9.5/10 - I seem to appreciate this song more when its live. <br /> <br />Spiel Mit Mir - 10/10 - What can I say... <br /> <br />Klavier - 10/10 - Again, nice and slow. This song reminds me of seemann. <br /> <br />Alter Mann - 10/10 - This is a real standout song. Its got that funky beat I just can't get enough of. <br /> <br />Eifersucht - 10/10 - This song couldnt have a better topic. It also reminds me alot of laichzeit. <br /> <br />Kss Mich - 9/10 - Kind of a weird song for my taste. Its got an alright chorus though. <br /> <br />Stripped - 10/10 - This is a cover of depeche mode. Its very good. The english lyrics, the awsome guitar riff, its vertually flawless. <br /> <br />Album overall - 9.66/10-10/10 - Very nice album. Heavy, soft, funky, you name it. You cant go wrong with this one.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I grew up with the original Star Wars, so you can spare me the \\"purist\\" drama. I loved these films then, and I love them now. (I can't blame Lucas for updating his films. Heck, I've edited this review three times now.)   Watching it on DVD for the first time was like watching the FILMS for the first time. The colors almost jump out at you. C-3PO and Darth Vader shine like never before. I see things in the DVD that I didn't notice the first dozens of times I've seen the films in their various other forms. The sound on my home theater made me feel as if I were there.     A New Hope:  I knew about some of the changes, but I didn't know there were an additional few seconds of scenes. You have to have watched the original films several times to catch there new extended scenes. The Greedo-Han scene has been cleaned up from the '97 Special Edition. There's no longer a \\"jerking\\" Han, but Greedo still fires first. (That's about my only quibble.) The Han-Jabba scene is fixed a bit from the '97 version.     The Empire Strikes Back:  When Darth speaks to the Emperor, it's a different looking Emperor from the original version. It's more like the one in Episode VI. The dialogue has also changed slightly. (I won't ruin it for those who haven't seen it yet.)  Boba Fett's voice has been dubbed by the person who is in episodes I and II. I bet most people won't even notice.  Those are about the only changes. In every way, the quality is superior to anything out there.     I will hang onto the original version on VHS, but will only watch the DVD's.    Unless Lucas ever gets hard up for cash, I seriously doubt that you will ever see the original versions on DVD. If his vision for the films hadn't changed, he never would have tinkered with the films in the first place. I personally like most of the updates. (Though I wish they would clean up the speeder bike scenes in Ep. VI. It's so obvious the actors are sitting on a prop in front of a blue screen. The scene with the Rancor DOES look sharper.)    (BTW, do some of you even read the reviews or just check \\"yes\\" that it was helpful if the person gave less than 3 stars and a \\"no\\" that it was not helpful if the person gave more than 4 stars? There seems to be a pattern, no matter how poorly a review is written.)    One question for everyone that is whining about the changes: If you had seen these versions first, on DVD, would you even care that some things were altered from the original? Think of it this way, the films were edited and cut just like all other films are. The only differences are that they were released once and it took 27 years to get a finished product.
B000268QB2|5.0|What  refreshing CD of the year!  If you like coldplay, youll like this!  Very good CD
0393035158|5.0|Almost a century ago, in an era very similar to our own, H.L. Mencken observed that one has a duty to respect one's neighbor's religious belief only to the same extent that one is required to respect his belief that his wife is beautiful and his children smart.  Sam Harris might have agreed with Mencken on the condition that nobody tries to make national policy out of Mrs. Neighbor's comeliness. <br /> <br />Sam Harris has written a book with a premise that should be wholly non-controversial:  Beliefs for which there is no evidence should not be the basis for governmental policy.  This includes religious belief since religion by definition is faith based.  People who believe that Noah's ark was a literal historical event should not be jailed but neither should they be in charge of public school curricula.  Furthermore, nobody has a duty to pretend that such a belief is rational; the same First Amendment that protects belief in Biblical inerrancy also protects the snickers that such a belief invites. <br /> <br />That such a premise is controversial speaks volumes about the world in which we live and, as Harris points out, poses the gravest of threats to human safety and happiness.  As Harris documents, religious faith has in the main produced a long parade of human misery and has more often than not obstructed any real progress toward curing social ills.  Harris also thoroughly debunks the claim made by religious adherents that religion is necessary to a system of morality, which claim actually requires a huge amount of chutzpah given the evil morality most religions have fostered. <br /> <br />Harris has a scientific background (he is completing a doctorate in neuro biology) and a thoroughly readable style of writing that together make this book an intellectual treat.  I didn't agree with all of his arguments - I believe in free will and he doesn't, and his suggestion that world government might offer solutions to some of our problems is belied by the graft, corruption and incompetence on a global scale that emanate from One United Nations Plaza - but overall I found him lucid and making direct hits. <br /> <br />It is only possible to do so much in one short book, but there are subjects he didn't touch on that I would have liked to have seen included.  For example, there has been recent publicity given to the so-called God gene - do humans believe in religion because they are genetically hard-wired to do so?  Also, most humans seem to have a deep psychological need for both ritual and adoration; is this genetic, and if so, what will replace religion as the primary means to fulfill those needs?  And finally, there are some questions not suitable for a scientific answer; people who believe in science need to be candid that there are questions that science can't answer, and may never be able to answer; religionists will be only too happy to point this out if we don't.  So I would like to have seen a discussion about non-empirical tools of cognition.  But as I said, there is only so much that can be covered in one book. <br /> <br />Overall, this book is definitely worth the read.   <br />
0761536434|5.0|Excellent book about how video games started.  I highly recommend this book (and anything else Steve Kent has written for that matter) to anyone remotely interested in how video games developed to their position today.  Thanks STEVE!!
B000000H4V|5.0|This was my first Sepultura album, and probably the first 'extreme metal' album I ever bought, if memory serves me right.  So I guess it has a bit of sentimental attachment, but this is definitely a great metal album, and a highly influential one. (even if most of what it influenced turned out to be crap) Personally, I prefer the previous three Sepultura albums, but, of course, thrash is my favorite metal subgenre, and Sepultura was probably the second best band that the subgenre had to offer.  So, your slower, more straight forward groove metal album is unlikely to top those classics, but 'Chaos A.D.' is about as good as that sorta album is gonna get.<br /><br />People like to say that Sepultura 'sold out' with this album.  Of all the times I've heard that a band 'sold out' this is probably the most ridiculous accusation of all.  This album was and is devastatingly heavy, and as heavy as anything they released up to this point.  Simply put, nothing this heavy could ever be considered a sell-out album.  That, and there was nothing like this that was at all popular at the time.  This was frickin 1993, not 1999.  Still, if you're looking for a thrashing, you're gonna be disappointed.  However, they can groove like nobody's business, and Igor lays out some really innovative and interesting rhythms, considering the era when it was made.  Andreas goes pretty weird on us with the lead guitar, with lots of shrieking and wailing, but he actually makes it work for once, and the style really fits the whole mood of the album.  Max's vocals, which were already quite insane on 'Arise' up the ante here, further justifying his position as perhaps my favorite roarer/howler/shrieker/growler.<br /><br />Everything on here is at least fairly interesting, and it's got more than it's share of classics.  'Refuse/Resist' really blew me away the first time I heard it years ago on a metal radio show, and it never fails to impress.  It's got just about the most devastating chorus ever recorded.  Remarkably 'Territory' manages to top it, though the studio version isn't quite as crushing as some live versions I've heard.  There's not all that much to 'Kaiowas' but I think it really works.  Sadly, it stops right about when it really gets going, but it's still a very enjoyable track.  'Nomad' and 'We Who Are Not as Others' are both slow moving, atmospheric pieces which I wasn't all that fond of initially, but have really grown on me over the years.  Surprisingly, the cover song, 'The Hunt' is probably my favorite track on the album.  It's got such a great, heavy groove, and Max gives perhaps his best vocal performance on the album. (The highlight is when he says, 'We can spend our whole lives waiting for some thunderbird to come/ We can spend our whole lives waiting for some justice to be done.  Simply devastating.)<br /><br />Yeah.  Fans of old-school Sepultura may or may not like this, but it definitely deserves a shot.recorded.

1400032717|5.0|Before I read this book, I did not know much about autism. However, the book with a beautifully narrated plot, allowed me to feel, experience, and live the life of the child who suffers from autism. The book was complete enjoyment, one of the few I couldn't put down for an entire day. You truly gain a great feeling for Christopher ( the protagonist's life), while also feeling so much compassion for this child. It is definetely more than a book, it's an experience.
B0002X314C|5.0|I have been a fan of John Legend since the early part of this year.  I saw him performing \\"Through The Wire\\" w/ Kanye West, and I fell in love with his voice then.  I went to his website and ordered all of his independent Albums.  i have been waiting for this album for a while, and he did not dissapoint.  I have heard many of these songs live and it is great to hear the studio versions.  My favorite song is \\"So High\\"  I love that song.  This is a cd that can play all the way through without skipping songs.
B0002X314C|5.0|I love Prince's Musicology, but its Prince you know its going to be good.  Usher: everyone's heard Confessions and loves it.  But J.L. provided this years greatest surprise.  A talented brother with a refreshing take on r&b music and he definitely turning the game out.  With influence ranging from Donny Hathaway to the purple one himself, he also has a little hip-hop background which is apparent on ths hit, \\"Used to Love You.\\"  And yes J.L holds it down on the uptempos but it is on the hit \\"Ordianry People\\" \\"So High\\" and \\"I Can Change w/Snoop\\" that he shines.  His gospel trained voices swoops and cries and belts its way through hip hops tough/soulful beats (provided by none other than Kanye) and through soulful beats that could have been on been on Donny Hathaway's \\"Everything is Everything\\" album or Stevie's \\"Superstitition.\\"  He is doing big things and his talent does not stop there.  He plays a multitude of instruments with the piano being his favorite.  It is now official:  J.L and Fantasia are the best new artists of 2004 hands down.  Do yo thanG!!!
B00006RU5B|5.0|Like lotsa people out there, I was fairly disappointed in 'Audioslave' when I first got it.  But, it's really grown on me since then, and I really think this is a pretty great album, even if it is a bit too laid back and slow for an album of it's length.  Still, I like everything here, and it's a good listen, and far better than what you'd usually hear on the radio.  Still, I'm demanding bigger, more exciting things from Audioslave in the future.<br /><br />When I first heard about this band, I was a little concerned.  Sure, Chris Cornell is an absolutely great singer, and the RATM boys are a great band, but they didn't seem like they'd fit all that well.  And, it would seem that they agreed, as they greatly changed their style.  Though it's got pleny of distorted guitars, this is a very leisurely, laid back album, for the most part, and  'Cochise' is pretty much an anomaly.  This was a little bit upsetting, at first, but once I got used to it I was really able to appreciate the album on it's own terms, and really get in to the subdued, melacholic atmosphere of the whole thing.<br /><br />RATM always had one of the best rhythm sections around, and they adapted nicely here. Wilk's drumming was always plenty unobtrusive, but he knew how to groove, and still does.  Tim C. has always been one of my favorite bassists, and he continues to write consistently interesting and memorable basslines, and always has a great tone.  Morello proves just how good he is by extending his range, adding in lots of haunting and atmospheric work, and some very sorrowful, bluesy leadwork.  And, he can still play the epic, crushing riff with the best of them (See 'What You Are'), and makes his odd, squealing leads fit into the new soundscape.  That, and they all just play and fit together like no one else in the hard rock or metal genres.  Some people appreciate, some don't, it's tough to say why.  You've got to have heard Cornell's vox at some point, so you've already got your opinion.  If you thought he sucked, you'll still think he sucks, if you thought he was great you'll still like him.  I lean towards the latter, naturally, though he's not quite as good as he has been.  His lyrics are well above average, and are actually worth listening too.  They aren't as good here as they have been, however, but I don't care about lyrics too much.<br /><br />As I said before, nothing here is even close to bad, but it really seem like maybe 2 tracks shoulda been cut for momentum's sake.  But, frankly, I'd have a pretty tough time picking two for the chopping block.  Strangely enough, I like the softest work best, for the most part.  Still, the best song would have to be 'What You Are'.  The whole soft-sung verse, loud-screaming chorus thing is old hat by know, but it's done as well here as it ever was.  'Like a Stone' and 'I Am the Highway' are both excellent slow, atmospheric songs, with flawless, memorable vox from Cornell, eerie, reverberating guitars and a great solo a piece.  'Shadow on the Sun' is another particularly creepy piece, with some more awesome vox from Cornell.(particularly the 'every drop of flame' part).  'Hypnotize' is a weird one, with an odd techno feel to it.  Still, once you get used to it it's great, very catchy and groovy.  A great song, and a great contrast to the rest of the album.  I didn't used to be much of a fan of 'Getaway Car', specifically because of the 'get yourself a car' part, but it's really grown on me.  The first chorus is really sweet, at least, and it's just got a great feel to it, to be very vague.  'The Last Remaining Light' is another particularly eerie and sorrowful piece, with perhaps Cornell's best vocal performance on the album.  More good lyrics too.  Most of the song's I didn't mention are of the softer verses, louder chorus variety, and they all work, even if they aren't necessarily all that distinct from one another.<br /><br />If you didn't like this album much initially, you should give it another look.And, if you're a Soundgarden or Rage fan who actually hasn't got this yet, well, come on.  You ought to give them a shot, at least.or Rage fan who actually hasn't got this yet, well, come on.  You ought to give them a shot, at least.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Napoleon Dynamite has been one of the better films of 2004. Then again, 2004 was a pretty lousy year for movies (seeing the only REAL good ones were Dodgeball, Harold and Kumar, Anchorman and Napoleon Dynamite). The film is a bunch of one liners, which is good in this movies case. The movie has virtually no plot- Not true. There is a tiny subplot to the plot that does not exist. Napoleon's friend, Pedro (only kid in school with a 'stache') is running for school president. Anyway, it is also good that there is a lack of plot because if you were to walk in on it 10 minutes before it ended, you would know as much about it as the people who have been watching from the beginning. One last thought; moonboots.
B000056NX5|4.0|Jerome Pradon's Judas may not be the best choice for singing, but for raw emotion I have not seen his equal.  I get completely drawn into his story.  Jerome Pradon's voice may shake, but it does so with passion.  He is amazing.  You may not choose this version for audio, but for vidio, it's amazing.  Sadly, the guy playing Jesus doesn't seem to be able to act his way out of a wet paper bag until  the very end of the movie, when Christ is dragging the cross and is then cruxified.  At that point he seems to realize he's supposed to be acting and actually does a good job.  The rest of the time, he wanders around the stage trying to look cute (I get the image of a puppy).  I love the movie as a whole, and it's much more timeless than the 1973 version.  Ultimately I WOULD recommend this to anyone interested in the story, and not just the music.
B0002ZDVEU|2.0|After seeing the first movie wich I think was one of the best actions flics in a long time I was waiting to see what the did to top it in the sequel.  <br /> <br />Bid disapointment. The camerawork and constant cuts even make a nice place like Goa India not look nice. It much darker. At one point Jason Bourne walks down a stair to a subway. I could not even see him in this shot for 2 seconds. Like your father in law is following you with his handycam to the basement of you house an there is not enough light. <br /> <br />I think the movie takes a tip down the hill right at the beginning when Jasons girlfriend gets killed. She was a big contribution in the first movie and taken that away there is less left.  <br /> <br />I could tell my wife what the sorry was and who would kill who just befor almost any scene.  <br /> <br />So This movie is by for not as good as the first one and not worth buying. <br /> <br />Sorry.
B000094DUP|1.0|When i first listen to \\"Born To Try\\" my heart told me to buy her CD. I Buy it and at first i found it interesting. But after hear it for a second time, i found that almost all of the song had a same tune and melody. It became boring after you kept listen to it. the only good song in this CD is \\"Innocent Eyes\\". I wonder how australian can said that this CD is more good than Kylie \\"BL\\".
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Napoleon Dynamite is one of the funniest movies I've seen in the last few years.  Its very deadpan humor might rub some people the wrong way -- but for me and for many, the humor hits the bullseye.  Napoleon is a nerd who hits the pinnacle of nerdiness and yet seems to exude a common sense sadly lacking in his brother and his uncle.  His classmates are all easily recognizable for us all because they bear such a close resemblance to reality.  I think just about everyone has had a Pedro, a Napoleon, and a Summer in their past.  The film is funny because the characters are real.  The barebones and almost plotless story is hilarious because it, too, is real. <br />In a tongue and cheek sort of way, Napoleon and his friends are elevated, in a certain sense, to a new level of respectability.  Without giving away the plot, we are are rooting for Pedro and happy for Napoleon.  Nerdy beyond nerdiness, ordinary beyond ordinariness, both characters win our hearts because they don't seem to be actors in the latest comedy film.  They seem to be real people. <br />Best of all, the film keeps any crude humor to the bare minimum.  Instead, it finds its humor in the bizarre happenings of everyday life.  It is genuinely funny in its own right -- a rarity these days. <br />Those who are looking for arthouse cinema, as some other reviewers have, are looking in the wrong place.  I'm a big fan of some great filmmakers, including Ozu, Kurosawa, and Satyjit Ray, but this film is not meant to be high art.  Instead, it is a comedy piece that is fresh, original, and sure to be a cult classic.  Enjoy
0812548094|4.0|The second book in the Sword of Truth series has pretty much the same strengths and weaknesses as its predecessor, so if you liked 'Wizard`s First Rule', you should enjoy this one. <br /> <br />The story starts within days of Richard's victory over Darken Rahl, when monsters from the underworld attack in the People's Palace in D'Hara and the Mud People village where Richard and Kahlan have gone.  It's soon discovered that Darken Rahl's use of the magic of Orden in Book 1 has weakened the Veil between the worlds of the living and the dead, and Richard and Kahlan are off once again to prevent apocalypse. The angle this time is that prophecy shows that the apocalypse can be prevented only if Kahlan dies.  <br /> <br />This time they are mostly separated, Kahlan traveling through the Midlands while Richard leaves with the Sisters of Light to seek to learn mastery over his powers.  Once again, there is no shortage of action, but the writing isn't the best, too many fantasy cliches are invoked, and the characters don't show any further development.  New characters and locations are introduced, especially in Richard's travels. <br /> <br />Once again, there is a somewhat morbid element running through the book.  Along with the battles, there is a good deal of rape, torture, and mutilation.  Unlike the prior book, it takes place mostly offstage and we generally get elaborate and excessive desriptions of the results more than the acts.
B00005OATM|5.0|When I think about what the best classical music's production is, I surely choose this one. I mean, of course, all of the four titles of \\"Der Ring Des Nibelungen.\\" A few years ago, I got them packaged into one box. Why can't we get it now? This \\"Ring\\" should be sold as a box set because this is truly \\"Art\\" production which is created by the great artists, Boulez, Chereau, and Orchester Der Bayreuther Festspiele. What a crystal clear sound and what an intellectual direction it is! Although Manfred Jung(Siegfried) is a miscast in this great production, it becomes a \\"considerable\\" concept magically. A great art is always like that. I highly recommend this one as one of the box set.
B0002X314C|5.0|John Legend's highly anticipated debut CD is phenomenal.  Legend is a gifted musican, singer and song writer.  The song arrangements are great and his voice is the perfect touch to complete the songs.  This is the best R&B album of the year.  I'm hoping that he will put out a live version of this cd and include some of the songs he's done over the past years. <br /> <br />Best Tracks of the Album (very difficult to pick the best b/c they are all very good) <br />Number One <br />Ordinary People <br />Stay With You <br />So High <br />Live It Up
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|I discovered Gilmore Girls(GG) back in 2000. I didn't know what to expect from this fast-talking series. Little that I know,I got sucked into the well-scripted,humourous yet heart warming show. I love the tiny down named &quot;Stars Hollow&quot;,where everyone loves their community living. The actors/actresses weren't well known back then,but with their true to life acting and the always fast-talking actors/actresses make this show so fun to watch.I strongly recommend this show to anyone who is tired of the current reality driven shows. Please give this series a try and I assure you will like it,I mean like it a lot. <BR>Gilmore Girls is into its 5th season now and I just can't wait for the DVDs to come out soon. But hey,good things always happen to the people who can wait a little longer, Right?
B00005JMJG|5.0|This movie is unlike any other you have ever seen. I saw it before getting on a plane to leave my lover and leave painful memories behind. I returned the next day and asked for my old job and my old life back. I think Oprah should do a show on the effect this movie has made in the lives of many couples. We're very happy now two months later.
0385513755|5.0|Amazing author writes amazing thing. Dan Brown is a fantastic writer who came in light after \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". This book has all the hidden talent of the author that makes the story fabulous to read. Each line of the story increases your craze about the forthcoming lines and you can only end-up with the last line of the novel.
B000001GX8|5.0|As a person who loves classical, I've listened to many recordings of The Marriage... being this one of the best I've heard. The singing is clear, crisp and brilliant. Although sometimes the all-german cast mispronounce some words or emphazise the R a whole lot. <br />Bohm style is soft and mellow, not thundering or fast such as Gardiner -another Mozartian conductor- and believe me, it's nicer to listen a slow Mozartian piece rather than a thundering one.  <br />Hermann Prey is at the top of his singing. Fischer-Dieskau sings a dark, potent Count and Janowitz's Countess is without match. All the other characters are very well sang. <br />This set includes two arias often cut off stage performances: Basilio and Marcellina's arias of the Fourth act. Those two are worth the price of the set, aside from the Sull' aria duettino of the third act.
B0002J4X1Q|4.0|Ok, what horror movie has a good script??? This is one of the \\"good\\" horror game-based movies I've seen, yet this falls short on revealing game antics. For those that have fans of the game for more than 6 years, will be dissapointed, yet will respect it for being Resident Evil, itself. The game series is \\"perfect\\" compared to the movie. This fairly deserves a 3.8/5. Recommended for any Resident Evil fan.
0930289234|5.0|A few reviews down, you'll find a man calling himself 'Oscar Wilde' from Athens, Georgia (home of R.E.M. and the B-52s for the musicphiles in the audience...)  I would like to inform him, firstly, that as a teenager and a devotee of Joyce, Steinbeck, Kerouac, etc. etc., I am certainly not unread, and secondly that I hope he doesn't teach at the U of Georgia in Athens becuase the man is a stonecold, government certefied idiot.  For one thing, he calls comic books, (which I prefer to the pretentious term, Graphic Novels,) a 'Child's medium'.  Now I'm not sure if I should consider that prejudice or ignorence, but either way it's wrong.  I have a feeling he may actually have a thing against comics, seeing as he also gave the Pulitizer winning Maus, (which I also highly recommend,) a one star review.  Perhaps his review of Watchmen is merely another means to sustain his prejudice by slamming the very work that best shows how not just comics, but superhero comics can reveal things to us about ourselves and society.  Oh well, on to the book then...<br /><br />I really don't want to talk about the plot since that can be gathered from other reviewers' articles, instead I'd rather discuss some literary aspects of Watchmen instead.  A good companion to this book is another mini-series released at almost the exact same time as this, Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns.  Where Miller builds upon the Batman mythos to create a redefinition of what a superhero can be, Moore totally deconstructs the superhero genre from the inside out, dealing with the darker side of our facination with superheros.  Another concept central to the book is the consequences of what happens when regular people have godlike control over events and make godlike decisions that affect everyone, (a comment on Nuclear War, another key theme of Watchmen?  Interestingly, this analogy applies even better to the terrorists of the present...)  Moore provides us with excellant characters here who provide differant insights into the morality of making such decisions, (the most famous and memorable probably being Rorshach, who is scarily magnetic.)  But one thing that sets this apart from other tales of morality is Moore's complete lack of jugement of the characters; you can actually tell alot about a person by which characters they believe did the right thing.  However, what keeps bringing me back to Watchmen is the insane amount of detail.  In the span of twelve chapters, Moore creates a completely believeable world with more than 50 years of history and he's managed to cram in so many small things into the corners that say miles about some characters, that it'll take several readings to completely understand the whole book, (I've read it upward of 8 times and I'm still finding new things.)<br /><br />All in all, I can't recommend Watchmen more.  It's the Citizen Kane of mainstream comics and should not be missed.  More has remained a very prolific writer since Watchmen, but I doubt he (or anyone for that matter,) will ever reach the level he achived here ever again.  It's a masterpiece, plain and simple.  Buy it and prepare to have your head exploded.<br /><br />(P.s. If you want to read more about Superheros as symbols for society, go to ign.com, then find the filmforce section, and from there click on the \\"Comics in Context\\" section.  This guy has a degree in literature from Harvard and writes amazing articles about the comic book medium.)
B000669GAI|5.0|Pearl Jam is by far the best band to come out of the 90's. They didnt give in to the corporate nature of modern music in the MTV era and are still relevant today...and making great albums and playing to sold out shows around the world... <br />This is one of the best greatest hits released...i would change very little about it, except maybe have better liner notes....but that is another matter <br /> <br />The new remixes of Once, Black, and Alive are very good. makes me wish they would re-release Ten remixed in its entirety... <br />Plus a lot of the tracks on the collection have been remastered/ or alternate versions. <br />The booklet has some very cool pictures of the guys from all eras of their career <br />-The two cds are divided into the Upside, disc 1, and the Downside, disc 2 <br />
B0006399FS|2.0|I liked some of the songs, but they sounded a like. Not as much power as I am used to hearing from U2, so I was disappointed when I bought the CD. I gave it to My brother in law, thats how much I disliked it.
0345457684|5.0|Part hard science fiction, part pulp action flick, a little noir mystery, laced generously with outrageous violence and sexual imagery, Altered Carbon reads like a rocket ride in a whirlpool of electrons and blood. Unlike Neuromancer and others of the line, Altered Carbon is scribbled to the margins with fast-paced action drama (and is indeed, for better or for worse, being written as a screenplay by the same person whose prior credits include Rollerball) as Takeshi Kovacs, the reluctant protagonist pries the stacked (pardon the pun) clues to an unlikely homicide from those that bar his way with detached ultraviolence.    Morgan writes with a visceral and calculated style that is partly reflected in the almost gleeful descriptions of violence, gore, sex, not to mention the imaginative implements of war. It keeps the pages turning and helps the plot and characters to \\"get to the next screen\\", to quote a euphemism from the book. Hidden among the pages, Kovacs and Morgan also draw interspersed indictments against elements in contemporary human society (especially those that denouce resleeving and thus progress, and the Sharya software, a reference to a very real practice that bears an almost identical name).    As deliciously bruising gunslinger saga and as telescopic snapshots of the human condition in a deathless and soulless age, Altered Carbon doesn't fail to please.
B000000645|5.0|This album has haunetd me for 35 years. If your mind is open you will be rejoicing..if its not been opened do not pass this offering.
B0002OERI0|3.0|Green Day has mellowed considerably, though that's not necessarily a bad thing. \\"Good Riddance\\" and \\"Waiting\\" are pretty mellow, but awesome anyway. The reason I give this CD a rating of three is the lack of a standout song[s]. My favorite Green Day CD is still Insomniac, when they were at their punkest, but they've matured throughout their careers, releasing some pretty great, though totally different, albums in Nimrod and Warning. American Idiot aside, I think this whole CD is just one song with obligatory breaks interspersed at random intervels. And you know what, they do it well. The two 9+ minute songs are excellent (Jesus of Suburbia and Homecoming). The two very slow songs are quite good as well (Boulevard of Broken Dreams and Wake me Up When September Ends). My favorite part of the CD is the first two minutes of St. Jimmy, where they return to their vintage punk sound. If they had inserted a song break after those two minutes, I may have given it four stars, but an unecessarily mellow ending really detracts from an excellent ending. Not to say that the mellowness is always bad, they just do it badly in a couple places, the ending of that song and \\"Give me Novocane.\\" I also don't like \\"Extraordinary Girl,\\" it's different, others may like it. Green Day's gotten much less punk, so this CD would appeal more to mainstream listeners. If all you like is their punk stuff, DO NOT buy this album. If you think Warning was different, yet still good, you'll probably like this, at least most of it. If you didn't like Warning (and liked Dookie or Insomniac), you'll probably hate it. If only they hadn't mangled the end of St. Jimmy, this would have standout song. As it is, it is a CD of lots of good songs but no great ones.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|(...) This is the best album since That great K-Os album. My favorite songs are COLD HARD BITCH, ROLLOVER DJ and LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE. IT really reminds me of ACDC
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Alicia Keys is breathing life back into the whole R&B genre. This woman is everything a genuine artist should be. Afterall, she can actually sing, and not just in the studio, she plays the piano, she oozes sex appeal, and yet she's still classy. Alicia should be an inspiration to those other flashy female artists who seem to think that sex appeal means looking and acting \\"slutty\\". You don't have to be practically naked to make a great song. I know sex sells, so I'm not judging, but I do think that's what Alicia Keys represents. It's very rare that you buy a CD these days, and you like every single song on it, but I'm glad I couldn't say that about this one. This is how R&B should be (NOT POP!).
B00067BBQE|1.0|This band is very talented and it would have been a great DVD if only who ever produced this DVD tried to watch it himself. The cuts are very short and before you can focus on one scene it is gone. If this is your favorite band you don't get to see it!  Compare it to falling down from a window trying to make out the people in the windows you are passing by.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This album turned out to be soooo much more that I originally expected. It's just so rare that you can actually get an album these days, and you really like every single song on it. I hate buying CD's, and with the exception of 1 or 2 songs the whole entire thing sounds like crap. I'm glad this one didn't turn out that way. Christina's voice has changed so much from her first album that it is clear that none of the other pop singers [...] can touch her. [...] Whether you love Christina, or you hate her, you still have to give credit where credit is due, and the fact is, the woman can sing her @ss off. I think there are very few artists in the business now that can compete with her powerful vocal range. I don't understand why she gets so much crap and negativity. Then again, I guess some people just need something to complain about. It could be the \\"Dirrty\\" videos or the \\"[...]\\" image, but whichever one it is, I don't know. However, I do know that I don't have a problem with her being a very sexual woman. Especially, when men get to talk about, make fun of, and sexually exploit women all the time. It's O.K for them to have half-naked women prance, dance, and parade around the T.V screen. However, the \\"double standard\\" comes into play when it's a woman, and then she gets labeled (mainly by other women) as a \\"[...]\\" or \\"[...]\\". I absolutely love Christina, and that includes all her \\"Dirtiness\\". If she has the body and stamina to strip, dance, get dirty, or take it all off more power to her. I am not as judgemental as some people I guess.
B0001ZMWQO|3.0|I think Franz Ferdinand is one of those bands that have one or two hits and then will totally dissapear. So I will say that this is just an average album that will be forgotten in some time. Their debut \\"Take me out\\" is pretty good also some songs on the album 2 or 3, but after you start hearing the album a lot of times it starts to get boring and in some point you will stop listening to it. If you want to have some fun for some days this is ok, but if you are looking for a CD for your Cd collection or for a masterpiece this isn't for you.
B00004W50T|5.0|MUSIC FROM BIG PINK, the debut album from The Band, was the manifesto for the revolution in simplicity wrought with their second album. The songs are based on the Memphis-Chicago-Texas-St. Louis-Muscle Shoals-Detroit-New Orleans-Kansas City blues/R&B/soul/rock & roll axis, as well as country, folk, ragtime, vintage jazz, Cajun, and jug-band styles, and totally eschew the musical excesses of psychedelia for a sound and lyrics steeped in American history. Although things start off a bit slow with \\"Tears Of Rage\\", the album as a whole cannot be denied. The three best songs here are \\"Chest Fever\\", an organ workout far superior to anything Procol Harum or ELP ever did; \\"The Weight\\"; and \\"Long Black Veil\\", a tale sung from beyond the grave by a man executed by hanging for a murder he didn't commit. Like the self-titled second album, this one is also highly recommended for anyone with a \\"B\\" average or better in American History class, whether it was in high school or college.
B000268QB2|4.0|First I want to say that this CD has really great songs like their first single \\"somewhere only we know\\", \\"she has no time\\" and \\"bedshaped\\" (wich is my personal favorite). Keane has a good music style that has been strongly compared to bands like coldplay and travis and I certainly sounds a bit like them, but if them sound like these good bands, who cares? if they sound like them is because they make good music. I highly recommend this CD to all the people that enjoy good British bands.
B00008LOS1|5.0|If you've made it this far on the page then just buy the CD.  You will not be disappointed.  \\"Who's Next\\" is one of my favorite albums of all time despite \\"classic rock\\" radio killing \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\".  \\"Bargain\\", \\"Song Is Over\\" and \\"Getting In Tune\\" are great songs and I've rediscovered what a great song Love Ain't For Keeping is.   <br /> <br />The live disc is a beautifully chaotic representation of the band at the peak of its powers.  The live \\"Bargain\\" is not to be missed.   <br /> <br />This is a great companion to Live At Leeds in showcasing the Who as they would never be heard again.  Please, please, please, keep digging into the Who vaults.  We need some more beauties like this.
B0000DJZA0|4.0|First I want to say that when I say \\"some of their best songs\\" I'm refering to some of my favorite coldplay songs like \\"Green Eyes\\", \\"Warning Sign\\", \\"Brothers and sisters\\", \\"Easy to please\\", \\"Spies\\" and \\"We never change\\". But don't worry all Coldplay hits are in here like \\"Clocks\\", \\"Yellow\\", \\"The scientist\\", \\"in my place\\",etc.The performance of Coldplay on stage is totally awesome and the documentary is interesting. This DVD is very close to be PERFECT but the fact that some of my favorite coldplay songs are missing makes me stay waiting for another coldplay DVD.  <br />Check out the new songs theyre really good <br />If you like Parachutes and a Rush of blood to the head go buy it <br />Also listen to some travis wich is with coldplay my two favorite British bands. <br />
B000002H6C|5.0|This was probably Metallica's last good work before they went MTv pop-culture on us and completely sold-out (and cut their hair!!!) Each song is a well-written and executed example of what James and the boys were able to do.  The songs are all fresh and interesting, and are probably where Opeth got their inspiration for varying the riffs several times in each of the songs.  James' lyrics are all well-written and thought provoking.  Get this album if you listen to any type of metal.
044024157X|1.0|I am surprised to see so many positive reviews here.  The books started off wonderfully, with an interesting protagonist and fabulous details of life in a small town in the 70s.  The murder and subsequent trial was also great, and the suspense that this all set up was good too. <br /> <br />Then, the story pretty much stopped moving.  Grisham got into painful details - scenes that had almost nothing (and I'm being generous) to do with moving the plot.  I kept reading because I couldn't imagine he could do this... it had to pick up again somewhere, didn't it? <br /> <br />Sadly, no.  The last few pages got back into the drama, but the story ended with a neat excuse for real closure.  Too simple, too convenient.   <br /> <br />Someone described this book as \\"literary.\\"  I don't see it, sorry.  Grisham is one hell of a story-teller.  He's got a great imagination.  I imagine this is one of those books that \\"by contract\\" had to be finished according to some publisher's schedule.  Too bad.
B000000H5J|5.0|This is by far the best Fear Factory cd I have ever heard!  It is incredibly heavy and a seamless mix of industrial and death metal.  The musicianship is untouchable and incredibly fast.  Its amazing.  listen to Pisschrist (what a great title!) The drummer is just blazing away, and the guitarists are keeping up with his blasts perfectly.  I can't think of many other bands that can do this.  Another point that needs addressing is the fact that Burton C. Bell is a metal God!  His ability to go from a hate-filled skullcracking roar to a seemless clean voice is amazing.  He is one of the best vocalists out there.  My favorite tracks are Demanufacture, Zero Signal, A Therapy for Pain, and Pisschrist (where is your Savour now?)  If you like your metal fast and heavy, then get this excellent cd.  Also check out Remanufacture, the techno-industrial remix version of Demanufacture.  Its predominantly instrumental, but pretty cool, especially if your familiar with Demanufacture.  The remix for A Therapy for Pain is pretty alien and creepy.
B00005JKGO|5.0|What can be said about La Dolce Vita that has not already been said? Nothing left to say. It's all been said thousands of times and by better writers than myself. So I will approach my review from the historical significance of \\"La Dolce Vita\\"><br />  Some think that \\"8 ½\\" is Fellini's masterpiece; some think his later works such as \\"Amarcord\\" are his best and most accessible. Yet others lean toward \\"La Strada\\" or \\"Nights of Cabiria.\\" But for me \\"La Dolce Vita\\" is the Maestro's masterpiece.<br />  It was made at the end of his more realistic period on the verge of his dreamier concoctions. Yet in this film you feel the effects of dreams and the drifting segmented form of dreams<br /> . The film is set in the most exciting period of the history of cinema. The early 1960's when Rome played host to the film word and was know as \\"Hollywood On The Tiber\\" a time when big American bucks were pumped into such studios as Rome's Cinecitta to produce films like \\"Ben-Hur\\" and \\"Cleopatra\\" and Vincent Minnelli's rip off of \\"La Dolce Vita, \\"Two Weeks in Another Town\\".<br /> At the same time such wonders of the Italian cinema as this gem, and works by De Sica, Antonioni and Visconti were being made. All of this in the midst of the birth of the paparazzi press of Rome. Here in Fellini's film you are shown that world in an inwardly turned and self-loathing lens. A glamorous and hollow world that is not so different from our world today. And in many ways gave birth to the media frenzy we find ourselves encircled by just as Anita Ekberg's Silvia is upon her arrival in Rome.
B00006SFBD|5.0|Well folks, its Opeth, isn't it?  So of course it is the absolute best death metal money can buy.  This is definitely Opeth's heaviest work, with a bigger influence placed on heavy roaring electric guitar chords.  As such, this cd is best if thrown into your cd changer with Damnation. These songs all exhibit the usual Opeth brilliance.  Incredibly heavy but very melodic at the same time, Opeth should be required listening for all of humanity.  While this cd isn't quite as good as Blackwater Park or Still Life (what could be?) if your a fan of Opeth you will still love every minute of this disc.  Get it, you won't be disappointed.  Another interesting thing I've noticed about heavy Opeth cd's like this is that they turn rap fans into little puddles of human effluence, which means it does double-duty for humanity...
6301966562|5.0|A friend and I saw this when we were both in the military back in 85. To this day he still calls me \\"Moles\\". We fell in love with the movie. It was funny, heart felt and light-hearted. I would love to see this in DVD form. I've tried to find this movie other stores with no avail. This is the first time I've seen it available, but at such a high price. Hopefully they will release it in DVD soon.
B0002XDODU|4.0|This is my 3rd Rammstein album.  I bought Live aus Berlin, and then Mutter before this.  And i have got to say, Mutter is one of the best albums I have ever heard.  Ever.  Every word, every note superb.  It was the reason I am taking German classes now.  So I had high hopes for this cd.  but I feel let down.  Most of these songs are very slow and soft, nothing like Mutter.  Mutter was much heavier, and the few slow songs on the disc were still absolute masterpieces (Mein Herz Brennt!) This cd had some good songs, like Reise,Reise, Mein Teil, and Amour, but overall I would recommend buying it first.  Play the hell out of it, and then get Mutter.  That way it won't be tarnished by the perfection of Mutter.
B00008OLYN|3.0|Well, I would like to start off by saying that this CD is fairly interesting to listen to, although it is not only not death-metal, but it's not even metal at all.  This is a very, very soft CD.  It is not exactly my cup of tea, and considering that Opeth is a progressive Death metal band, I'm not sure what to make of this.  He has a wonderful voice, and that is probably what saves it from being totally horrible.  The melodies are interesting, but the songs are shorter, and this CD seems very un-Opeth. <br /> <br />Its an ok listen, but if you're a big death-metal fan, with little taste for anything else, don't even bother buying this.  It shouldn't even be considered metal.  I think one CD like this is plenty, so hopefully Opeth is done with this vien.
0553583182|5.0|I have read a little over half this book and believe me its one of the best books I've ever read. This book is about faith in the divine order of the universe and how you can use it to your advantage. I've only started practicing some of the techniques in this book around late december of this year but I already have seen results! It quotes alot of bible scriptures which many religious types have misinterpreted and gives you the true meaning behind them. Erase all negative thinking from your conscious mind and surrender to the good and limitless resources of your subconscious. This is the most important book you'll ever read in your life!!
B00006ZXSK|5.0|Drew Barrymore in not slight, nor is she a pushover as Daniella, the real Cinderella.  In this twist of the fairy tale as we have come to know, Ever After has made the fairy tale more realistic without the fairy godmother and the magic.  Instead, this girl uses her smarts and courage to win the heart of the prince.  I was not a Drew Barrymore fan until I watched this film, and although she had received criticism for the accent used in the film, soon you forget and accept the accent as part of Daniella.  This is now part of my chick films and lit library.  What else is in this library?  Roman Holiday, Prince and Me, Bridget Jones Diary, Princess Diaries, Diary of a Discount Donna, A Cinderella Story, and Pretty Woman.
B00005JNEI|2.0|Yes, Moore has certainly exercised his First Amendmant rights in making this movie. It is interesting to note, though, that he has a stable of lawyers at the ready to set upon anyone who speaks out against this  entertaining film. Ironic? <br /> <br />This was an enjoyable piece of fiction, but calling it a documentary is a stretch. Some sources are misquoted, some facts are misstated, some are patched together in a misleading fashion, and I'm sure that some would argue that some are falsified. But falsified is too strong a word -- the fact is that Moore has taken some creative liberties to support his viewpoints, as he has mentioned in the press and on his web site.  <br /> <br />That doesn't take away from its entertainment value. Watch it, enjoy it, but do your own research instead of accepting what's being thrown at you without question. And don't be incensed when you learn that the film is misleading -- it is just a movie after all. Moore takes the pseudo-documentary craft to a new level. The film itself deserves four stars, but I can't in good conscience rate it that highly as it is sorely mislabeled.
6305949980|5.0|Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas is imaginative and sweet.  Not too frightening so that children under 5 will not be able to enjoy this movie, but exciting enough to keep the attention of all ages.  The cgi artists did an excellent job creating the entire style and look to the story.  It is like watching a storybook come alive in 3D.  A real treat for this Halloween piece is the music and voice of Danny Elfman as the well-intentioned, but innocent Jack.  Enjoy this film anytime you want a treat and add it to your collection of children's films like James and the Giant Peach, Toy Story, and A Bug's Life.
B0002858YS|4.0|After hearing the single \\"Somebody told me\\" I wasn't all that impressed with the Killers.  I just received the cd for Christmas, and I'm thrilled!  Every single song tops their first single, and I have a new found respect for \\"Somebody told me\\".  This cd is great all the way around, and puts a refreshing spin on a few genres of the past.  I was thinking of forming a band that combined the sounds of the Cure, Duran Duran, and Depeche Mode, but the Killers beat me to it!  Pick this up, and love it.
0792164903|5.0|The color of the film, the mood, and acting of Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, and the legendary Christopher Walken adds to the stylish rendition of Washington Irving's short story.  Although there were more added to the original story such as the backstory on Miranda Richardson and the romance between Christina Ricci's character with Johnny Depp, this is one version of Sleepy Hollow that sends chills down your spine and still manage to entertain both genders.  A date film?  Yes, definitely.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I remember the live aid event very well and how special that entire day felt.  Received (and gave) this DVD set as a Christmas Gift and have had so much fun watching and remembering that special day.  Some of the omissions were noticed but the booklet's explaination makes it clear that we are very fortunate for what was captured.  Some amazing standout performances and everybody did it live folks!  No sign of the plastic fake popular musicians that have become the norm today, in this DVD we see it all...mistakes made live, musicians with big noses, bad teeth, goofy clothes and everybody plays their hearts out, for real!  Stand out performances for me were Style Council, U2 (who literally jumped on the rocket to superstardom during their performance!), Queen (nobody like Queen, it felt so good watching them perform again), Bowie, Paul Young, ok, ok....I love them all!     <br /> <br />The bottom line is, if you are passionate about the music...you need this DVD in your collection.  Hang on to your old VCR tapes to document the day as it was and make this small investment.  I know that the DVD quality sure was better than my old tapes!  The fact that it goes for a great cause is a bonus, the price very reasonable considering 4 DVDs, and the overall quality is fine.  Put it on and turn it up LOUD....and DANCE...and SING....and REMEMBER the day! <br /> <br />

B0000028RR|5.0|Rage Against the Machine were, are, and will always be one of the most popular rock bands of the 1990's, and perhaps the last true punk band to be heard.  Yes, you read that right: punk.  I wholly think of RATM as a punk band, because they made a huge stand to voice the voiceless and alert the public as to how corrupt and vile the system of the United States of America is, and all at once creating some awesome and powerful music. <br /> <br />A majority of musical fans dislike RATM to varying degrees.  Some debate as to whether or not RATM were actually metal, or the first rap-metal band, or other such irrelevant arguments.  Many others are quick to point an accusatory finger at them as being hypocrites, due to their being signed with Epic/Immortal Records, which is run by Sony (an obvious corporate \\"machine\\").  As good a point as this is, it should be painfully obvious that RATM were fully aware of what they were doing when they signed.  It doesn't take a politically-aware person to realize that RATM were *using the machine against itself*.  Because RATM created awesome music which raked in millions of dollars, Sony wouldn't have ever wanted to lose them.  And because Sony is so powerful, RATM made their voices heard to the max.  This is a pretty \\"punk\\" thing to do, I think; the U.S. government and the media have never faced a more resourceful rebellion within the world of music since Bob Dylan, the Clash, the Ramones, and other true punk bands; thus, I include RATM in what I consider to be the punk rock genre.  Not enough of a reason in itself?  Okay, there's plenty more to talk about with RATM. <br /> <br />First off, the band is, in itself, simply awesome.  Brad Wilk's simplistic yet powerful and propulsive drumming helps carry the beefy rhythms and riffs which are so distinct to RATM's sound.  Tim Commerford never fails to impress me as a bassist; like Brad, his style is simple, yet highly effective in that he often is going off on a vastly different (yet harmonized) melody parallel to the guitars...and speaking of which... <br /> <br />Tom Morello is perhaps the most creative metal guitarist from the past twelve years.  With a whole score of effect pedals and a knack for originality, he creates some of the weirdest, most *non*-guitar like sounds ever heard from that famous instrument.  Just listen to the bridges of \\"Fistful of Steel\\" or \\"Killing in the Name.\\"  It's not all effects, either - sometimes he'll unplug his guitar and tap the end of the plug on the bridge of the guitar, creating weird feedback squeals that could turn Jimi Hendrix's head. <br /> <br />And then there's Zack de la Rocha.  You either like Zack's voice, or you hate it.  I have yet to meet or know anyone who has an opinion which falls between those.  I, personally, like his voice, a lot.  It is the raw, unrehearsed voice of billions of fed-up people, in its purest, most astonishing rage.  And his rapping?  It's just his style; it's part of what makes RATM so distinctly unique, if not wholly original. <br /> <br />This, their 1992 debut, works very well as a whole, and each song is extremely well-written in themselves.  It's refreshing to hear a band that isn't spending all their time whining about bad childhoods or bullies at school; although RATM have plenty of anger and angst in their music, it's for much broader reasons.  I often have real difficulty dissecting a whole RATM song's lyrics, but often small sections of songs are complete enough that they have powerful and true meanings.  Take, for instance, \\"Wake Up.\\"  During the second verse, Zack raps, \\"You know they went after King/ When he spoke out on Vietnam/ He gave the power to the have-nots/ And then came the shot.\\"  How much more true can that get? <br /> <br />However, as much as I praise RATM lyrically and thematically, their overall sound is what I like about them the most.  They are so distinct musically, blending various styles such as hip-hop (NOT rap - it doesn't take a music expertto know that), funk, metal, hard rock, and even classic rock. <br /> <br />On \\"Take the Power Back,\\" Tom plays an actual guitar solo here; this is probably his single most unusual performance on at least all of Rage's studio albums.  There's also a nice guitar melody (finely complemented by Brad's drumming) during the last verse, creating a dazzlingly peaceful feeling as Zack whispers, \\"We gotta take the power back,\\" and seconds later an eruption of instrumental heaviness and Zack screaming, \\"NO MORE LIES!\\" <br /> <br />\\"Know Your Enemy\\" features some great riffs and drumming.  There are some crazy guitar effects on here, as well.  Also, the great Maynard James Keenan of Tool and A Perfect Circle fame lends his amazing voice (including a terrific scream) in the bridge of this song. <br /> <br />I've heard somewhere that \\"Wake Up\\" is a rip-off of Led Zeppelin's \\"Kashmir.\\"  While there are similarities between the opening riffs of this song and Mr. Page's own, the resemblances between these songs stop there.  Besides, Zeppelin were one of RATM's biggest influences; of *course* there are similarities in their music!  Plus, \\"Wake Up\\" is more aggressive, has a completely different meaning, and has a much more varying structure.  Oh, and not to mention it's a great and powerful song, as well. <br /> <br />\\"Township Rebellion\\" has some funky drum beats, including what sounds like cow bells!  The guitar whirs and buzzes with strange, unnatural weirdness.  The solo is pretty catchy, if a bit tripped-out. <br /> <br />As to the recent band formed from the ashes of RATM (all of the original members, but with Chris Cornell, formerly of Soundgarden fame, in place of Zack), I have only to say that as much as I like them, they will never be better than RATM.  Granted, both bands are hugely different, musically and lyrically, but if I ever had to pick between the two, I would stick with RATM.  By keeping on the edge of their toes, RATM had something really special.  Audioslave aremore of a typical (albeit very talented and original) rock band.  This isn't to say I don't *like* them; I do, in fact, think they're quite good.  I only think that RATM and Audioslave should be viewed as two wholly different bands. <br /> <br />So there are all of my thoughts on Rage Against the Machine, at least with this album and of their general nature.  Agree or disagree, like it or not, they help remind me that although the U.S.A. can ruin many things and create endless laws and hatred, and enslave everyone living within with the money and media system, there will always be one freedom that nobody can ever take away.  That is the freedom of thought.  And with Rage Against the Machine, my thoughts are satisfied.
B000669GAI|5.0|If there was a really good band from 1991 to 2003 it was probably a rock band left over from the 80's or a band that was influenced by Pearl Jam. In the Oasis (pardon the pun) of crap that is out there today it is so very refreshing that this Greatest Hits CD comes out. My suggestion to record companies who are wondering why CD sales are pitiful, and are  looking to sue the next grandma or student, is to try to find a band with the talent of Pearl Jam and people will want to buy the CD. This CD is the best way to heal the Aiken or get out of the Real World and listen to something good. Then again you can go to an intimate concert of the lastest \\"big act\\" or wait in line to see a sixty year old icon sell out Madison Square Garden.     Vinnie Vin   [...]
B00005QIPH|5.0|I don't understand why so many people don't like this album. I think it's a lot better than their following album. I got the CD two years ago for Christmas and I still think it's a solid album. All the songs are really good. They're the kind of songs that you listen to with the volume up high while driving.  <br /> <br />Bear in mind, this isn't an album where you can analyze the lyrics to death. They're just good tunes that you can sing along too.
B00006LSM3|4.0|A very consistent and solid album. I found it to be warm and light-hearted, especially considering he was dying while recording it. Every song is good but what it lacks is one great song. It was finished by his son, Dhani and Jeff Lynne who thankfully didn't overproduce this one. Other musicians you know are Jon Lord and Jim Keltner. RIP George and thanks for one more album.
B000063DI8|5.0|Iron Maiden's 8th and arguably their most adventurous album to date puts replacement guitarist Janick Gers in the lineup to fill the shoes of absent guitarist Adrian 'H' Smith. Following their most prominent release so far 'Seventh son of a seventh son' wasn't always going to be an easy task, but Iron Maiden let rip from the get go. <br /> <br />From Tailgunner, an opening to follow suite of Aces High, the killer first track from Powerslave to Mother Russia, the epic that tells us about change from the totalitarian USSR to free Russia. Never missing a beat, and showing the fans that Iron Maiden just cannot go wrong, No Prayer for the Dying is a must for both Maiden fanatics and newcomers alike.
B00005JKZV|4.0|`Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' is the second of the Lord of the Rings trilogy directed by Peter Jackson. The DVD is the wide screen theatrical release edition featuring the theatrical release of the film and an additional disk with some special features. <br /> <br />It covers two discs with a running time of almost three hours; `Two Towers' is an incredible sequel to `Fellowship of the Ring.' For the first time, viewers get to see Gollum in the flesh so to speak. The animated character acted by Andy Serkis definitely steals the show with the awesome visual affects, dialogue, and contrary emotions this complicated character has. The film continues where `Fellowship' left off but propels the story forward at an amazing pace. <br /> <br />We are indulged in the scenery of Rohan and the immense Battle of Helm's Deep but also are exposed to the first appearance of the Ents who are living, sentient tree people. `Two Towers' also brings the characters of Merry and Pippin to the forefront allowing actors Billy Boyd and Dominic Monahan to shine. Of course, the story of Frodo and Sam's friendship entwined with the journey to destroy the Ring of Power plays a major role and continues to develop. <br /> <br />True fans of the novels and first film will especially enjoy this DVD. Retailing at $17.99 the DVD is a good buy but unfortunately falls short in the special features department. The special features gems include Sean Astin's short film, `The Long and Short of It' and the trailer for `Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.' <br /> <br />Although the film is a joy and the special features entertaining people may wish to wait and purchase the extended version of the film instead. If the extended version of `Fellowship' is any indicator, `Two Towers: Extended Version' will be a DVD everyone must add to their collection. Having scenes expanded and cut scenes integrated with the film and a plethora of special features will make the extended version more in demand thanthe theatrical release. <br /> <br />While we wait, `Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' theatrical release is a good buy with its fun special features, and DVD-ROM content. It includes English and Spanish subtitles but no available dubbing.
B0002ZDVEU|1.0|For those of us with Home Theater systems, Bourne Supremacy was more distraction than attraction.  <br />First, has Hollywood completely abandoned the use of the tripod and dolly altogether? Every single shot was handheld with dizzying motion. It was so bad, that was all we were thinking about throughout the film. \\"He's dialing a phone! Quick, move the camera to add tension!\\" \\"So why not have multiple fast zooms in and out with a big orchestral sting?\\" (-2 stars for 90s TV camerawork)  <br />I had to check this problem on my computer to make sure my projector wasn't out of alignment. My computer confirmed that this entire movie is predominately green. Oliver Wood seems to had forgetten his Tiffen FL-D fluorescent filter on the initial shoot. Did he do the entire film in green to avoid this embarrassing miscue?(-1 star for Star Trek I color lapse)  <br />The plot was excellent, but I thought the death of Franka was a typical Hollywood motivational formula worthy of a Simpsons spoof. If the motivation was to protect Franka, the movie would have been far better. (-1 star for Mask of Zorro motivation) <br />I am giving the movie one star for these glaring errors. Three stars lost for cinematography alone.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This is in the tradition of indie greats Kevin Smith's Clerks and Richard Linklater's Slackers. <br /> <br />I saw this film in the local community theatre when it first debuted and I received it today from my friend Paul for my birthday, in addition to Katamari Damacy for PS2, and this film completely blows my socks off. The film is Napoleon Dynamite, an indie film by brothers Jared and Jerusha Hess, both Mormons, that is constantly hilarious without resorting to \\"dick and fart jokes.\\" The film is also one for the kids as the closest to swearing is when a character, usually Napoleon, says \\"Gosh!\\" or \\"Dang!\\" Not only is the film hilarious but it tackles many important issues that lie just beneath the film's surface. The issue of economic wealth, racial harmony/disharmony, social and class harmony/disharmony, and rural American life. <br /> <br />My friends and I laughed throughout the entire film at the community theatre in a nonstop laughfest. Tonight was a repeat, albeit solo, laughfest. The film, lasting nearly 90 minutes, is a joy to watch and it is no wonder that it was a nominee for the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. <br /> <br />This ranks near the top of my list of favored films with 5 stars.

B0002OERI0|5.0|I'm sure many of you know of the band Green Day.  I've been following them since 1039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hour.  Many people think they hit their zenith when Dookie was revealed.  There's no doubting the lasting appeal and impact of Dookie nor the slide towards mediocrity that followed that album.  Insomniac and Nimrod were simply mediocre, despite Insomniac featuring Geek Stink Breath in my personal hour length film version of Bram Stoker's Dracula for 8th grade English in what can be called my Clerks. where I played a multitude of parts, and the albums that followed were horrid. <br /> <br />American Idiot thrusts the band both into the spotlight and towards heights they once trounced.  Several songs, such as St. Jimmy and She's A Rebel are classic Green Day but the overall album is a sampling of different genres.  The band that perhaps singlehandedly thrust punk into mainstream allowing bands sum 41, blink 182, new found glory and others to break out, takes one gigantic leap for audiophile-kind.  The overplayed American idiot and Boulevard of Broken Dreams are wonderfully politically charged ballads worthy of Rage Against the Machine while referencing rock gods Pink Floyd and The Beatles while also managing to infuse some Foo Fighters. <br /> <br />Even Wake Me Up When September Ends, yet another politically charged song, which sounds poppish like a Britney Spears/Jessica Simpson/Ashley Simpson/insert female half-n*ked soloist here is a huge change for the band that formerly blasted \\"taking all you down with me\\" with \\"Explosives duct taped to my spine\\" in a previous album. <br /> <br />Some may call this an album of politically clichd lyrics but I say Green Day has shaken off their slump, see Warning and Foot in Mouth and others, to fight back from their demise.
B00062ZE3U|3.0|This is a good album & worth buying, but after making an album as fantastic as their last one(Mother Earth),this comes as somewhat of a letdown! Im not a fan of Evanescence & feel they are mediocre at best and unfortunatley this album sort of sounds a little too much like Evanescence for my taste, as a matter of fact there are times when I couldnt tell I was listening to Within Temptation(even the lead singers voice sounds a little different on this album). The stand out track is \\"Memories\\". <br />I truly hope this album isnt the direction the band wants to go & on their next release they can get back to buisiness. Before you make up your mind about this band rush out and buy Mother Earth, Hell buy 2 copies.

B0002X314C|5.0|AMAZING album.  i've heard him live several times, and let me tell you, he's the real deal.  john is one of those performers that has that extra \\"something\\" that just can't be learned or fabricated.  his sound is so new yet so familiar, so smooth yet so edgy.  don't get caught sleeping on this album, b/c it's going to the top of the charts.
B00005JNLY|3.0|In 2004, Adam Sandler starred in two romantic comedies with a dark/bittersweet edge, playing opposite two leading ladies (Drew Barrymore in \\"50 First Dates,\\" Paz Vega in \\"Spanglish\\") with whom he had real chemistry; but both movies managed to fall short of the mark. The problem with \\"50 First Dates\\" was it couldn't decide whether it wanted to be \\"Groundhog Day\\" or more typical Sandler fare. The problem with \\"Spanglish,\\" on the other hand, is that it's like two movies in one--and one of them isn't very good.<br /><br />The movie that doesn't work is the one about John Clasky (Sandler) and his harridan of a wife Deb (T&eacute;a Leoni). As has been pointed out elsewhere, Leoni does a superb job of portraying one of the most unsympathetic characters ever committed to film, but this part of the story goes nowhere. In fact, at the end of the movie, we're left wondering just what the whole point of the relationship was.<br /><br />Maybe it was simply a plot device to get the second movie off the<br /><br />ground? The one that leads me to recommend \\"Spanglish\\" despite its flaws: the relationship between John and Flor (Paz Vega). In it, Sandler demonstrates that he can certainly play it straight, although, as in \\"Punch-Drunk Love,\\" he can't help letting his inner SNL player loose occasionally. He's getting better, and one of these days he'll make it, but as of yet he's no Jim Carrey in \\"Eternal Sunshine.\\" But bravo, anyway. As for Vega, in the first few scenes of the movie one fears for her, as much of the action appears overstaged and focuses too much on the language issue--but once those hurdles have been passed, she absolutely shines, in both languages.<br /><br />In \\"Spanglish,\\" both Sandler and Vega do what romantic leads must do--make the audience want the two of them to get together and feel fulfilled if they do and somewhat empty if they don't. It wins on that count. But Deb is a distaction and her mother is pleasant but non-essential. The Claskys' son is a cipher, and their daughter and Flor's, though played by fine actresses, seem to belong in yet a third movie. As with \\"50 First Dates,\\" had the filmmakers been able to settle on one major theme, this could have been great--as it is, it remains worth seeing, but is more a hopeful sign of better things to come than an enduring classic.their daughter and Flor's, though played by fine actresses, seem to belong in yet a third movie.

B0002Z9HT8|5.0|As someone who was too young to remember Live Aid, I can say I can appreciate the fact that Bob Geldof finally gave permission to release this DVD.<br /><br />The performances and the quality of sound for archives over 20 years old is amazing. This DVD was put together from aging archives that the BBC never threw out or destroyed from Wembley including the entire Queen performance that has become the talk of legends. MTV gave archive footage they had of the JFK/American portion of the concert. Bob Geldof wanted the footage destroyed and wanted this to only be shown as it happened that day in 1985, it seemed as if this magical event could have never been destroyed or hidden from future generations.<br /><br />The performances are breath taking. Queen, Phil Collins, Sting, The Boomtown Rats, Eric Clapton, Neil Young, Tom Petty, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Duran Duran, Status Quo, Paul McCartney, Ultravox, Adam Ant..<br /><br />You also get a good look at how the concert was put together, how Band Aid was put together, the situation of 1984-1985 Ethiopia, and a documentary of how the aid money was delivered and spent showing the effects of it on people they were able to give food and supplies to.<br /><br />So, for the price, this is a great way to remember this once in a lifetime event that moved people and brought people together to end the famine in Ethiopia. Nothing has ever matched this event, and no one has done what Bob Geldof has done and not even The Beastie Boys for Tibet.
B00003CXB2|5.0|I am embarrassed to admit I never watched David Lean's 1962 film \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" until quite recently. I never went out of my way to avoid the picture, and I'm definitely a fan of Peter O'Toole (a rather passive one, I admit), but this movie just never found its way onto my play list. A lot of my hesitation to sit down with this epic centered on its incredible run time. \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" clocks in at nearly four hours, or the amount of time it would take me to watch two or even three schlock pieces of junk. A friend at the university finally convinced me to rent the movie, although his claim that \\"you just gotta watch it\\" fell on deaf ears. I don't \\"gotta\\" do anything as far as I'm concerned, especially when it comes to motion pictures. My rental patterns operate on fairly obscure principles that even I don't understand, and it sometimes takes a lot of work for me to move a film to the top of my list. I conceded in this argument, however, and promised that I would green light \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" immediately. Of course, I couldn't believe I waited so long to see the movie after watching it.<br /><br />Lean's film begins with a very short introductory piece showing us the demise of T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) in a motorcycle accident followed by a rather prestigious looking funeral service. Several English elites make contradictory statements about the man, ranging from panegyric to barely disguised scorn. It's an intriguing way to start the film because it makes the viewer wonder what sort of chap could rub people in so many different ways. Then we learn the backstory. Lawrence works for the British as a map maker and reader in Cairo when he learns about a rare opportunity: the country needs men to visit with the Bedouins in order to secure their support for war against the Ottoman Turks. It's a tough job, one that requires brains as well as brawn, but Lawrence eagerly signs on despite very real doubts concerning his ability to accomplish the task. Off he goes, into the desert and to his destiny as a military genius. His adventures in the sands of Arabia soon attain the mark of legend, as he manages to unite various warring factions into a cohesive army that causes serious damage to the Turkish forces on the continent. He is less successful reconciling the strategic aims of the British and Arabs as the war draws to a close.<br /><br />I'm going to depart from my standard two-paragraph summary with \\"Lawrence of Arabia.\\" There is too much going on this film, too many plot twists and turns, to do justice in a short review. The first thing that strikes the viewer about this movie is the stunning cinematography. Lean wisely recognizes that to tell the story of T.E. Lawrence, he must include the desert as a major character. It is the harsh, sun blasted environment of the Middle East that informs every action taken in the film. Sand dunes and rocky crags stand in the background of the film with grim oppressiveness as well as stunning beauty, either pressing down on the small humans wandering among them or embracing them depending on the circumstances. Extraordinarily long tracking shots filmed with special lenses bring home the arduousness and danger of traveling through the desert. Just as important as the climate are the characters, and to fill these roles Lean chose his cast very wisely. The venerable Alec Guinness injects an air of gravitas mixed with incredible humor into his role as Prince Feisal, a central figure to the Bedouin tribes. Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif work wonders alongside O'Toole's Lawrence as Auda Abu Tayi and Sherif Ali respectively. Arthur Kennedy shows up as reporter Jackson Bentley, a man interested in Lawrence the warrior. Claude Rains, Jose Ferrer, and Jack Hawkins turn up in critical roles, too.<br /><br />But it's O'Toole's Lawrence who sits at the center of the film, and it's O'Toole whose subsequent career flowed from the promise he showed in this picture. By all accounts, T.E. Lawrence wasan incredibly enigmatic, complex individual impervious to definitive character study. Lean does as good a job as any trying to define the man. We see Lawrence as the quintessential Englishman, an Arab warrior, a preening narcissist, a diplomat, a learned scholar, a tyrant, and a man plagued by insecurity and doubts. He is, in other words, an everyman and an extraordinary man with the same strengths and foibles we all share to some degree. The memorable scenes involving O'Toole's depiction of the character would fill a book: He dances through the desert looking at his reflection in a knife blade after donning his Arab accoutrements, poses atop a train after a battle as though reveling in the understanding of his power and accomplishment, and he cowers with the fear of a man broken when the Turks torture him. What impressed me most about the film--a small thing, really--was the absence of a romantic subplot. No woman emerges to cast her charms on our lead character, which is incredible for any film. Then I realized that the love affair is there for all to see, namely the love Lawrence has for the desert and the Arab people.<br /><br />Check out the extras for the film. Four featurettes, a documentary, original newsreel footage, and a few other odds and ends will keep you glued to the television set long after the movie ends. An epic that Hollywood probably couldn't pull off today, \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" is an exceptional piece of cinema every fan of the medium should watch at least once. Actually, subsequent viewings reveal even more of its magic if you can find the time to watch it again. Lean and O'Toole went on to make many other films, but neither ever topped this one.ce was an incredibly enigmatic, complex individual impervious to definitive character study.
