B00005JOFQ|5.0|My comments here don't pertain so much to the film itself than to thoughts concerning the snub Hollywood gave \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" at the Oscars that year.  True, director Ang Lee won the coveted \\"Best Director\\" award that year that EVERYONE predicted he would win.  Even Spielberg, who was also nominated that year for \\"Munich\\", could only say: \\"Too Good\\".  But the biggest shocker was \\"Brokeback\\" losing the \\"Best Picture\\" Oscar that year to the underwhelming \\"Crash\\".  Could it have been H-Wood's way of a \\"Brokeback Backlash\\"?  Very well could have been.    Once in a while the Motion Picture Academy in Hollywood REALLY gets very self-important and high on its ARSE and blows it!  2006 was one of those years and instead awards the \\"Best Picture\\" to CRASH.  In terms of the story packing an emotional punch, \\"Brokeback\\" is right up there with \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" in giving the audience an unforgettable movie-going experience, especially as the film marches to its shattering conclusion.  As expected, \\"Million Dollar\\" won Best Picture Oscar the previous year for director/producer Clint Eastwood.  And then to have Hollywood award \\"Best Picture\\" to Martin Scorsese the following year for \\"The Departed\\", well, everybody knew that was a token for making up to the man for snubbing \\"Raging Bull\\" 25 years earlier.  I don't know if Ang Lee will ever get a second chance to win \\"Best Picture Oscar\\" that Hollywood has accorded Martin Scorsese, who has been nominated for several years running.  The are folks in the Asian community who speculate  Ang Lee (who is Chinese from Taiwan) was perhaps the victim of \\"Racism\\" in Hollywood.  That might hold true to some level, but when it comes to matters like \\"Racism\\" these speculaton cannot be substantiated or proven.    Movie critic Roger Ebert predicted in the final weeks of Oscar voting that \\"Crash\\" would win \\"Best Picture\\" based on his observations and conversations with members of the motion picture  academy.  He comes out to say \\"Brokeback\\" was suffering from a backlash of sorts in Hollywood.  To say it was Homophobia is a joke considering how many gays work in the film and entertainment industry.  What led to \\"Brokeback's\\" downfall during the final weeks of Academy voting?  We'll never know, but to say \\"Crash\\" is a superior film compared to \\"Brokeback\\" really perplexes me.  Once in a while Hollywood really gets it right and awards the best films and actors with a deserving Oscar.  But many times Hollywood really misses the mark, and sadly for \\"Brokeback\\" fans, 2006 was one of those years in giving the coveted \\"Best Picture Oscar\\" to the much-less deserving \\"Crash\\".  I'm sure Ang Lee has lost sleep many a nights wondering why he won all the major awards leading up to the Oscars and then to lose the BIG ONE on the biggest night in Hollywood.  That's a bitter pill to swallow.
B000002KDX|5.0|This maiden venture brought the brilliant rock band, \\"America\\" into the world  spotlight in the early 1970's. About that time, they won a Grammy for, \\"Best New Artists\\".   It's what hooked me to their music. It doesn't matter how  young or old one is. It's music that inspires the heart, mind, body and soul. This music   defines, classic Rock and Roll.

B001GCUO5M|1.0|Here is what I liked best about the film:  When the woman patient asks for a glass of water and in the shot of her drinking it she has an empty hand!  Then she puts the empty glass down on the table.  I spent the whole rest of the film wondering if that was supposed to be a clue to something!  Ugh.
B00000ING2|5.0|The Hudsucker Proxy(1994)was the Coen Brothers' first big budget movie. It was a December film that was released in May. As a result its theatrical release was not a financial success, but the film compares favorably with the Coen Brothers' most successful comedies. The screenplay, written by the Coen Brothers with Sam Raimi,is outstanding. The acting by Paul Newman, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Tim Robbins is totally over the top.<br />Tim Robbins plays a mailroom clerk from Muncie Business School who is hired to run the company after Paul Newman and company directors concoct a scheme to hire him as CEO to drive the stock price down so they can buy ownership of the company for pennies on the dollar. Does the plan work? Watch and you will not stop laughing.
1577314808|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read for personal growth.  IF you only read one book this would be it.
032147404X|2.0|I'm going to come straight out and admit it: I hate this book.    Sure, the photography advice is fine. If you're not interested in the theory and you just want to know the best way to shoot X or Y, this book can be quite helpful and would probably be a good one to tuck into your camera bag when you go on vacation.    Unfortunately Kelby's writing is so abrasive to me that despite owning this book and knowing it's on my shelf I will scour the internet and spend hours on trial and error before I resort to consulting it. The author likes to make jokes that I find incredibly condescending. He spends a paragraph spinning an elaborate false definition of the term \\"tack sharp\\" only to go \\"ha ha, just kidding, it just means it's really sharp, like a tack!\\" at the end. Anyone at all familiar with the term will see through it immediately. Anyone who isn't familiar with it will be pointlessly led on and potentially confused. I can't figure out what the point of these digressions is -- apparently some people find them funny but I found myself wondering if the book needed padding. I felt like the attempts at humor were a waste of paper and of my reading time.    It's also worth noting, although this isn't necessarily a problem with the book, that The Digital Photography Book does not cover the camera theory basics. You won't learn why the relationship between aperture, shutter speed, and ISO is how it is. You will learn specific ways to do specific things but you won't necessarily know why those things work. Personally I learn better when I understand the why as well as the how, so this doesn't really fit my style.    Four stars for the photography advice. Minus two stars for writing so irritating I can't use the advice.
0131103628|5.0|This is probably the best book I have ever bought.  I had to pick it up for an advanced Unix and C class.  I am an infant in the IT world, as I have only been taking computer classes for the last 4 years.  I have had to learn several languages though, and I can say without a doubt that this was the most clear, most logical book which I have learned from.    As you may have read from other reviewers, this book may be daunting if you are unfamiliar with programming or programming in an object-oriented language.  However, if you really want to master C, then this is the book to have.
B00164GDE6|5.0|This is the BEST one of the two Bad Boys movies.The Blu Ray picture quality and sound is AMAZING! Get this movie you will not regret it!
0545123283|5.0|\\"This is a love story. I never knew there were so many different kinds of love or that love could make people do so many different things.<br />I never knew there were so many different ways to say good-bye.\\"<br /><br />Finishing this book, the only words I could form in my brain were, \\"Damn, that was good.\\" And it was. From the goosebumps-inducing introduction to the dramatic conclusion, I was fully engrossed. Waiting for Forever will, indeed, feel like forever.<br /><br />There's no question that Maggie Stievater has a knack for writing. Even negative reviews of her books tend to comment on the fact that it is very well-written. There will be times when I re-read passages several times because she does such a great job of describing scenes in such great detail that the reader can't help but be sucked in. I'll be honest, if this book was written by anyone else, it wouldn't be half as good.<br /><br />This is a much darker installment than its predecessor. That's why I liked it a lot more. This isn't quite as focused on the love of Sam and Grace, but more the problems that their so-called cure has caused as time goes on. This is what makes Stievater's melancholic tone seem more fitting in this novel than in Shiver.<br /><br />Also, in the last book, it was said how similar Grace's and Sam's point of views are. I'll admit, they did sound almost the same. In this novel, however, we alternate between four points of view: Sam, Grace, Isabel, and Cole. The author does a slightly better job of differentiating between the four, so their narrative doesn't sound so similar. The POV does tend to change pretty rapidly (expect plenty of mid-conversation changes), but it works. I also liked how Cole was characterized, and how we got to learn more about Isabel, who was simply the \\"bitch\\" character is Shiver.<br /><br />Overall, Linger is a very worthy installment in the series. I can't wait to see where the story will go next. And did I mention how beautiful the actual book is? Scholastic did a really great job in producing it.oducing it.

0525423842|5.0|I bought this book for my 12 yr old nephew. I am happy to say he really liked it. Very exciting and kept his interest. It was nice to hear he enjoyed reading a book for a change! He recommends it especially for a good summer read.[[ASIN:1432743406 Smitty's Cave Adventures]]
159102594X|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this trilogy.  Excellent character development and a fine sense of humor throughout.  This series ranks up there as an all-time-favorite read for me!    One side note: I wouldn't recommend for readers too young.  The language is fairly 'adult' as is some of the content.
B002VPE1AW|3.0|I think the only real reason this movie was such a big hit was i assume for its 3d effects in the movies (i did not see it in 3d and dont entirely care too as i hate most 3d movies in that they always have stuff flying at your face).    For all of its effects it story is pretty basic and to be honest it seems to more like a childrens film in plot and depth but also in a \\"grown up way\\" by using in my opinion unnecessary swearing and such.   The story while interesting in places and the theme of fighting for your land is nice it lacks any real depth.  It does not feel as epic as the lord of the rings movies did.  The animation and scenery is nice but nothing i haven't seen in games like Final Fantasy 13!    I was kind of expecting a little more.  at least titanic had a bit of depth to it.  This movie just feels rather shallow (and by depth i dont mean 3d depth i mean plot / character wise)     I think to be honest it seems the 3d visuals must have taken center stage vs actual real depth to the movie itself which is kind of a shame.    Its a interesting watch through but i woudnt buy it to see it again.  Also because of the laungauge its not really appropriate for young children which is a shame. if they had cut out the unnecessary cursing it could have been a movie for the whole family.    as it ends up feeling more in the end like a kids movie with cursing instead of an epic movie for adults!    in the end i think i find the story scenes from Final Fantasy XIII much more interesting then this movie.
0143118420|1.0|Like many others, Eat, Pray, Love... or EPL as some folks refer to it as (we Americans sure love our acronyms), was a selection of the book club I am in. Half the group liked it and half did not. The biggest hurdle our group had with the book was overcoming the fact that the inspiration for Liz's year long trip was ultimately a result of the $200,000 advance she received. It made her journey seem contrived. I also wonder how much of her adventure was fabricated in an effort to make the book better? One confusing part I had was that she stressed the point right off the bat that all characters names in the book were changed with the exception of Richard from Texas. But... whe she arrives in Italy, she meets a man by the name of Luca Spaghetti whom she insists is his real name. Why tell us these names are fake and then 20 or so pages later, tell us one of them is in fact real?      Nobody should ever question another individuals heartache or suffering. I absolutley feel that Liz had every right to not want to be in marriage she was not happy with, for whatever reason. And I also can appreciate anyone who has dealt with, or is still dealing with depression. But from this reader's perspective, her turmoil did not evoke enough sympathy to truly be interested in her situation. Maybe it's because I have dealt with my own years of sorrow? I did not live the life Liz lived so I could not relate to her struggles. And I also did not have the sky open up and drop a couple hundred thousand bones in my lap with a note attached stating that I was now free to travel around the globe for a year. Am I jealous?... Sure I am! I also did I have the luxury of friends and family visiting me in another country while on a self discovery trip. Seriously, Liz was visited by her Sister, Aunt, Uncle and friend from Seattle all while she was in ITALY! However, Italy did have some moments. Liz is a very gifted writer and her commentary on the people and quizine was entertaining and very descriptive. The problem I had was her thoughts of LOVE never went much beyond the superficial. Men appeared to be objects of lust and not much else. With her marvelous ability to observe and articulate details of her surroundings, I would have hoped to see a more in depth analysis of human emotion. My conclusion is that she does not have a very well defined understanding of even her own emotions.      By the time I got 25 pages into INDIA, I simply did not have any interest in continuing. Yes I know... I am one of those who thinks they should be reviewing a book that I have no business reviewing because I did not finish the GD thing! What I conlcuded from our club conversation is that those who enjoyed Eat, Pray, Love fell into the same category. Inspiration derived from having been in a similar situation recently, that Liz found herslef in when she decided to pull up stakes and travel the world.   For me... it was just something about the author that I did not like. I still can not put my finger on it but even her smiling photo on the back cover of my paperback made my temper flare ever so slightly when glancing at it. And make no mistake about it... EPL is all Elizabeth Gilbert. Italy, India & Indonesia are merely a canvas for which she paints her personality on. Why so many people either loved or hated this book is what intrigues the most. It makes for interesting social commentary if conducted in the right forum with level headed people. So kudos to the little book club I am in for being able to dicuss our differences without slamming someone elses viewpoint. They even convinced me to host a viewing when the movie is released on DVD. Bless their little hearts!
B001PB3RU8|5.0|Lungs is an amazing album, and will surely be enjoyed by anyone who loves unique alternative music. The rhythms and melodies are sort of ethnic, and the lyrics are stunningly poetic and meaningful. Combined with Florence's powerful and unique voice, the music is really quite invigorating. 'Howl' is definitely my favorite track on the album, though I am also a big fan of 'Drumming Noise' and 'Dog Days Are Over' which I've noticed is featured in the the film 'Eat. Pray. Love.' starring Julia Roberts.
B003ODL004|3.0|\\"I'm not interested in the massive heroic tunes anymore. Now I'm interested in how I can take two, three, or four notes and make a really complex emotional structure. It's emotional as opposed to sentimental. It's not b-s heroic; it has dignity to it.\\"<br /><br />This quote from Hans Zimmer about his approach to scoring Inception reveals both its strengths and weaknesses.  The two-note motif ideal popularized in the Batman Begins score comes full circle here, and like in previous works is both effective yet overused.  Nearly every track is built around differing two-note motifs layered upon each other but as Zimmer states above, there's no identifying themes for the characters; it's all based upon the emotional impact of the scene itself.<br /><br />Empasizing this is an anecdote about how Nolan refused to grant Zimmer any spotting sessions (previewing a rough cut of the film); all the themes were formed from Zimmer's impressions of the characters from the script.  It was only in the post-sessions that the suites and cues were tailored to fit the sequences- some Radical Notions, indeed (Special thanks to Tuco for reminding me of this!).  At times it can be compelling, but also often ends up as background noise as there's not enough to hold your attention for long- mine drifted more than once while listening to this.  To be fair, this is one where you really should see the movie in order to fully appreciate it.  The atmospheric composition and overall ambient feel compliments the movie perfectly.<br /><br />Some highlights: *Potential Spoilers Alert*<br /><br />We Built Our Own World- Built upon a two-note pulsing rhythmic base underneath another two-note synth key, it captures Cobb's emotional arc while revisiting the dreamscape he and Mal fashioned together.  I especially liked the Portishead-style 'vinyl skip' beat at the end.<br /><br />Radical Notion- 'Vinyl skips' continue through the intro before flowing into a 'white noise' support.  Brad Fiedel-style synths carry you along before the electric cello two-noters overlap with some bottom from Batman Begins (Molossus) before rising to a nice up tempo beat that ends all too soon.<br /><br />Old Souls- Delving into Cobb and Mal's backstory, it begins with a sub-tonal electronic fluttering underneath solo piano notes before laying in four and six-note elements.  More Brad Fiedel synths appear before the cello rushes and accelerated tempo carried by a rising 8-note motif before ending on more 'Molossus' bottom.<br /><br />528491- Opens with electric cello that blends into typical Zimmer percussions driving the urgency.  Ends on the 'elephant blast' two-noter from the trailer.<br /><br />Mombasa- Full-tilt action as Cobb is pursued through the streets of Mombasa by his former employers.  Several 6-note synth motifs overlap the percussion and help fuel the rhythm.  Lots of fun, actually.<br /><br />Waiting For A Train- Clocks in at 9:28, the longest track on the cd.  Two-note motifs flood the composition, supported by a sub-harmonic rumble.  At 7:03 the Edith Piaf vocal sample (Non Je Ne Regrette Rien/I Regret Nothing At All) used for the 'sound kick' makes its lone appearance.<br /><br />Time- Used in the movie's finale to underscore the end of Cobb's character arc it opens with the most familiar of the two-note motifs- alternating the second note's rise and descent- first as solo piano notes before morphing into synth.  Alternates versions are layered into along with an emphasizing guitar pick.  At 3:37 it rises to its full potential before dipping into reflective solo piano keys and a tonal finale.  Zimmer achieved his ends by effecting emotional response very well here.  *End Spoilers*<br /><br />This is a hard one to rate.  While it more than does a soundtrack's job of enhancing the movie you're tempted to yield to its appeal as an ambient cd release, and it doesn't quite have enough to stand on its own legs.  But that doesn't mean you won't like it for its overall scope.  This is where Amazon could use a 10-star ratings system: it's better than 3 stars, but not quite a 4.<br /><br />Edit on 9/30: If you follow the link below to the Inception Official Site, you can enter your email address to receive two bonus tracks, 'Projections' and 'Don't Think About Elephants'- both of which are pretty much remixed suites but nice to have anyways.<br /><br />[...]but not quite a 4.

0307266303|5.0|My daughter first read this book and she was hooked completely.  Dad, you have to read this book, it is one of the best I have ever read.  And you know what, she was absolutely right!  As many of the reviewers have pointed out, not only is it a great suspense \\"novel\\" (loaded with mega eccentrics) building to the final race results, but also a terrific scientific \\"user-friendly\\" essay.  How Chris was able to link up with all these incredibly interesting folks around the world, all with a story to tell about why our ancestors ran and why we must continue to run, is beyond me and I don't really care.  Just a fantastic read and impossible to put down.  I can only hope that in the future Chris takes on another diverse subject with similar positive results.  One of the best.

B003LXM1RS|5.0|Its not often that a pop album is released wherein every tune is a hit.  Each song fits a different mood I might have during the day.  I can't decide which one I like the most.

B00005JKJA|5.0|When I first heard that David Lynch was turning his rejected television pilot into a movie, I was a little skeptical. I thought it would be like the pilot of Twin Peaks that they was shot for release in French movie theaters. Anyone who has seen it knows what I'm talking about. They take the greatest pilot of all time and try to wrap it all up in three scenes. It's pretty bad, but at least it got Lynch to create The Man From Another Place. David Lynch added the end scenes on Twin Peaks because of a deal that was written into his contract. Thankfully he wanted to finish Mulholland Drive properly. Instead of adding three scenes, he was given seven million dollars to flesh out the ninety-minute pilot into a two-and-a-half-hour movie. The result gave David Lynch some of his best reviews since Blue Velvet. Words like masterpiece and brilliant were being thrown around. Even Roger Ebert, who hates all of Lynch's films, gives it a four star rating. The critical acclaim was deserved; ten years later Mulholland Drive stands as Lynch's masterpiece.
B003U9TDII|2.0|First off,  Inception the film was absolutely stunning. Everything from story, plot, directing, visual effects were superbly done.  And, quite honestly, its one of the top movies I've ever seen.    Hans Zimmer, however, basically fails as a composer for the flick. The movie is something unique. His music, however, is not.     This score is mostly a mash-up between a few numbers from the Black Hawk Down soundtrack (\\"Synchrotone\\"), The Dark Knight soundtrack,  and \\"Journey to the Line\\" from the Thin Red Line.     To say its imaginative and unique would be an utter lie!     If you're looking for the awesome music from the trailers, check out Zach Hempsey \\"Mind Heist\\" - he's the one that made the trailer music!     I was overwhelmed by the movie. I was completely underwhelmed by his work. Guitar work in this score is worth a mention.
B0036WHM1E|5.0|This is up there with 19 by Adele. Good music that should be supported by more people.

Jonathan writes from a very good stand point and after I was done reading it, I was glad I made the choice I did to become vegetarian.<br />You really should read it if for nothing else, to learn where your food comes from, it is not a pretty picture and the animal suffering might make you think twice.I would highly recommend this book.

B003LXM1RS|5.0|I'm glad that I've waited to write this review, because my initial reaction to \\"Night Work\\" was ambivalent. I knew right away when listening to this recording that it was extraordinary, that the music was excellent, but I was troubled by its authenticity. Was this really Scissor Sisters coming through on this CD, or was it Scissor Sisters sounding too much like the musical influences that shaped them?<br /><br />This was quite a dilemma for me. With each of the group's previous releases, I knew I was listening to the group's authentic sound: it was clear, it was crisp, and was real. But with this release, I found myself thinking, \\"Gee, this sounds just like Devo,\\" or \\"This sounds like Elton John circa `Madman Across the Water.'\\"<br /><br />Even the last track, \\"Invisible Light,\\" carries the influence of Roger Waters so strongly that I had doubts as to whether I was listening to Pink Floyd or Scissor Sisters. Where is the Scissor Sisters sound? I heard it in the first, title track, and it was there in \\"Whole New Way.\\" But I felt their identity was lost in the rest of the album.<br /><br />Yet, I kept listening, and it grew on me. Yes, \\"Harder You Get\\" sounds like it could fit neatly onto Iggy Pop's \\"The Idiot,\\" a call back to the song \\"Nightclubbing.\\" And \\"Running Out\\" makes me think of Devo from the New Traditionalists era (\\"Skin this Cat\\" also contains an homage to Devo) with an overt nod to David Bowie's \\"Fame.\\" But I kept listening because, yes, there was something else there. The Scissor Sisters sound was indeed there, the musical signature was indelible and unmistakable. It just took me a while to hear it. And when I did hear it, I saw its genius.<br /><br />Much like Frank Zappa used to do, this band takes the musical signatures of its influences and weaves them into their own statement; but unlike Zappa's homage to doo-wop or other sounds that was often satirical and over the top, Scissor Sisters' homage to these influences are sincere and uniquely their own.<br /><br />It took me a while to hear it, but when I did, I recognized a great recording.t, but when I did, I recognized a great recording.
0446613444|5.0|I am a big fan of the way Connelly writes and so far I have not found one book of his that doesn't keep me interested.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|I admit, I only like Alien and Aliens, but even so this blu-ray set is absolutely great value. Both Alien and Aliens have been upgraded to blu-ray quality and not look absolutely phenomenal. It makes these already classic movies look new and fresh. In addition, the blu-ray comes loaded with special features, making of documentaries, etc., some of which weren't available on the DVD version. Overall, even if you only like the first two movies, this set is a must-have.
0743277465|3.0|Other reviewers have already articulated my exact thoughts on the matter, so I'll just second the assertion that the title is misleading because it's a more of an autobiography than anything else.
0307474712|5.0|I selected this book to review for the Vine program because the title had been bludgeoned into my brain by the publishers's non-stop marketing blitz.  Everywhere I turn, someone's touting One Day as the summer's must read.  A female coworker of mine (who has completely different tastes in books than I) even recommended it to me while I was already reading it.<br /><br />Thankfully, One Day is the real deal.  With Emma and Dexter, David Nicholls has not only managed to create a romance that even guys can relate to as well as two characters who are believable as any flesh-and-blood people you'll ever meet. Dexter's a lovable cad, whose laid-back hipness and natural good looks propel him to early fame as a TV persona and generate an endless queue of hot women to pick from, while Emma's a brilliant writer who's lack of self-confidence leaves her trapped in unfulfilling jobs and relationships.<br /><br />Sure it adhered to the basic structure of the modern romance -- two attracting-opposites can't seem to get past all of sorts of obstacles between them and become the romantic couple they were meant to be. But what made this novel more believable than most in this genre is that the obstacles didn't have the usual contrived feel about them.  Instead the author showed how a hook-up at the end of college ignited enough interest to create a friendship bond that was just strong enough to keep them in touch over a twenty year period, yet not strong enough to overcome the ways in which they grew apart from one another in their maturity into adulthood.  The one-day-a-year plot structure, a cheap storytelling gimmick in less-skilled hands, worked because it actually enhanced this story.  And I loved how the first day was skipped and only recounted at the end, heightening the emotional impact.<br /><br />Part of the marketing hype centers on the fact that the movie adaptation is already in production.  This is one romance I will let my wife drag me to see without the usual whining and complaining.<br /><br />-Kevin Joseph, author of The Champion MakerKevin Joseph, author of The Champion Maker
B002ZG980U|4.0|May contain spoiler.    Inception has one cute idea, just like Memento has one cute idea, not much else. The execution is decent but nothing earth shuttering. There are so many scenes reminiscent of Dark City and the Matrix. The last scene on the plane reminds me of the last of Donnie Darko, only less potent.     Most of the action scenes are pretty much run of the mills. And the big reveal (involving the heir and his father) is woefully anticlimactic. The characters lack the \\"cool\\" factor like in the Matrix. And what the hell was Ellen Page wearing?
B003NHRGSQ|5.0|Did not disappoint. Just as good as Shiver if not better. The addition of Isabel & Cole added depth to the characters.
B003HTPHSQ|5.0|I'm not going into detail about tracks, but this album is simply great. If you like Cyndi Lauper and the blues you will like this album. Her back-up band is great. I saw her do a cut from this album on David Letterman with Allen Toussaint and i had ordered it within 20 minutes after the show was over. I was not disappointed. She does a few vocal duets on it too. Her voice is fantastic. One cut has Allen Toussaint and B.B. King. It's at a great price too.

B002ZG997M|3.0|If you're a Denzel fan like I am, then add this to your collection. Basically, the \\"book of Eli\\" is the Holy Bible. It was the only one that was left after the \\"war\\". Well, he has it and a man wants it. Get the movie to see what else happens. The plot has some holes in it, but overall, another good Denzel movie.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I bought the 212 Plus after reading numerous reviews - including Maximum PC who gave it a perfect 10 and the \\"Kick Ass\\" award. The cooler is amazing. It's very quiet, and my idle temps dropped over 10c and my Intel i7 875k unlocked chip never goes above 38c running at 29 x 133 unlocked from a 26 multiplier.<br /><br />Keep in mind, the cooler is MASSIVE. Make sure you have the depth in your case, as many will not accommodate it. There is room on the socket side. The install is pain in the butt. I did it on my 775 socket board, and on my new EVGA P55 Classified. The documentation is terrible - essentially worthless. Take your time, don't force anything, and you will figure it out.<br /><br />P.S. All the reviews I've read rated the 212 Plus better than water coolers. Plus, it's cheap.<br />[...]
0143118420|4.0|So I guess the real question is, would I recommend Eat Pray Love?  The answer is yes.  Despite my main complaint, I did find the book to be quite fascinating.  The book is well written and the author is fairly likable.  As long as you can get past the fact that her journey towards self discovery was done in an \\"extravagant\\" fashion, then I think you'll enjoy it as much, if not more, than I did.

0802473156|5.0|An affair was threatening to break up my marriage. I read several relationship books, and this one proved to be the best. It was straight forward, easy to read and easy to adopt the ideas into real life.

B002QFYJF4|2.0|\\"Magnolia\\" was released in 1999 and has a star-studded cast (John C. Reilly, Julianne Moore, Tom Cruise, William H. Macy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Jason Robards and more....) that do their best to get this contrived story of random lives coming together for a strange, artificial climax.  It is a movie that only certain people will enjoy. It was unbelievable overall, and the plots contrived to fit the ending.  The movie has both comedy and poignant scenes as the vignettes strive to gain your interest.  The lives of several people in the San Fernando Valley hit a wall together and we watch the unbelievable blow up before our eyes-including frogs falling from the skies.<br /><br />Overall, it is hard to follow and the outrageous plots tire one's imagination.
B00012QM8G|5.0|I can watch this movie & cry every time. Guaranteed. In fact, I just sat & watched it, then blubbered like a baby. If you have any interest in cinema at all, you must watch this film. I'd honestly rank it at the same level as Citizen Kane & on the scale of movies that reach your every emotion? It'd be at my #1 spot. I've seen movies that make me cry, but this is almost the only film I've watched that gets me every time.<br /><br />Since there's so many reviews on here that give a synopsis, I'll not bother giving one. If you haven't guessed already, I love this movie. I can't watch it all the time though- it hits your emotions that hard & you need some time for the impact of the movie to hit you.<br /><br />I love that this movie is predominantly in black & white- it makes it feel more in tune with the era. Plus when you see some things in the movie (the infamous girl in the red coat), it makes you notice things more, pay closer attention. It made everything more real. I also love the choice of actors. Not only does this film feature Ben Kingsley (a man who could act in anything & be fantastic), but it also had Liam Neeson in what might be the best role he'll ever do in his life.<br /><br />I know I'm heaping praise upon praise, but this film deserves it. I was in high school when this film came out & it was almost required watching from all of my teachers & I'm glad for it. If you don't come out of this film feeling grateful for the life you have, then you are either in an intensely horrible lifestyle or you are taking your life for granted.<br /><br />Even if you have to rent this, watch this film.

B0000640SB|4.0|\\"Men in Black\\", featuring Will Smith both as lead actor and end credit singer, is a classic comedy. When I first watched it years ago, I laughed at almost every situation. My favourite? Smith and the other guy are going to meet an expert on intergalactic diplomacy. Everyone assumes it's the weirdo with the dog. Actually, it's...the dog! Had me fooled, too. Another old favourite is the claim that Sylvester Stallone is an alien. The tall guy from Twin Peaks makes a guest appearence (he's been on Star Trek as well).<br /><br />Since I was versed in the UFO subculture, \\"Men in Black\\" struck me as extra funny, since the secret agents don't exactly behave as MIBs are supposed to. Usually, they behave in the exact opposite way... And yes, they are more cool!<br /><br />When I watched the movie last night, I was stuck by two things. One, I wasn't laughing so much anymore. Why? No idea. Maybe I'm older, maybe I'm through with the \\"funny Black sidekick\\" angle, maybe I remember the only twist element in the plot (\\"The Galaxy is in Orion's belt\\"). Instead, I found myself analyzing the meaning of the scene where Will tries to fill in a form at MIB headquarters, together with a bunch of marines. Is there some deeper meaning hidden away in that scene? Or is just me getting Freudian?<br /><br />Two, despite this, the movie isn't bad, although I might yet draw that conclusion when I'm Tommy Lee Jones' age, waking up from a coma after 35 years. Or perhaps I'm just tired of the UFO subculture?<br /><br />Although I no longer get laughing tics out of Will's character in sunglasses, I nevertheless give \\"Men in Black\\" four stars. If you are 20+, don't miss this classic sci fi comic flic. And remember: the Galaxy is in Orion's belt!
B002QGUFWE|5.0|When I reviewed the original \\"The Fame\\" I was just gettin to know what Gaga was all about. I wasn't too impressed to be honest, because while I thought the lead singles were brilliant as far as pop music goes, the other half of the album was all over the place.<br /><br />At this point though, its clear that Gaga is not just a one trick pony, she knows what she's doing (for the most part) and pours out catchy dance hits with ease while being an excentric character on her own. And also while you would never notice listening to this album, she can actually sing and play the piano very well, talents you dont see on most pop stars and are very well appreciated.<br /><br />This is a 2 CD collection. It includes THE FAME which has all the tracks we first knew her for... Pokerface, Just Dance, Paparazzi... all the good stuff. Then THE FAME MONSTER, which is a solid 8 track addition that features much more epic songs, such as Bad Romance, Telephone and Alejandro. This re-release consolidates Gaga in a much more blatant confort zone. The aditional 8 tracks could have very well been their own album. (and it is, if you already had the original The Fame) It is one big pop/dance greatness that can't be missed.<br /><br />Buyer beware: I know most people on here are upset that this cd is censored. To tell you the truth this doesn't really affect much, but if you are still bothered by not hearing the occasional \\"b**ch\\" then you might wanna skip this.
1151097764|5.0|Sherman McCoy, a 39 year-old white Wall Street bond salesman, self described \\"Master of the Universe\\" lives on Park Avenue, he is married with a daughter and is a member of high society. He also has a hot chick on-the-side Maria. On their way home one Tuesday night they make a wrong turn and end up in an abandoned seedy side of the Bronx. Two black guys walking down the street offer their assistance \\"Hey buddy, you need some help?\\", Sherman and Maria sure they're being set-up, panic and end up bumping into one of them with Sherman's Mercedes and then speed away without reporting it. It all blows up when one of the black guys turns out to be severely injured and the press, police and the mayor get involved in political issues involving race and class. The writing is so great that even in 2010 a story that was written 20 years ago still seems fresh and relevant. Kudos big time!
B003GDYN24|4.0|When tracks of this album started leaking, I realized that Kelis was again going totally \\"left\\" of where I thought she'd go musically.  I'm a huge fan of this woman who marches to the beat of her own drum but during my first few listens I couldn't really sit and listen to the album all the way through.<br /><br />The songs bleed into each other making it seem like one long disco track and while I am a fan of disco music, I had to be in the mood to listen to this album in entirety.  My favorite tracks are: ACAPELLA, 4TH OF JULY, HOME, SCREAM, SONG FOR THE BABY & EMANCIPATE.<br /><br />I appreciate how she went \\"all in\\" with the dance/techno sound and think that Kelis & her producers were ahead of the current resurgence of dance music on the pop charts and without proper support from her label, the album didn't do much in the US.<br /><br />*On the superficial having nothing to do with the music, I found the photo of Kelis' head on a dog's body to be deeply disturbing to the point where I've taped that page together so I never have to see it again.*
B003IPC5UC|4.0|This latest work by Kylie offers some strongly appealing new material, such as Aphrodite, Get outta my way, Closer, and Cupid Boy. It has an overall cool and is worthwhile for any Kylie fan but don't expect Fever in a second incarnation, this isn't a career pinnacle release. I would recommend the regular version as the DVD is sadly lackluster compared to previous extra materials released with her albums. You won't be missing anything to skip it. If you feel compelled to get it anyway the photo book inside will make you feel better, good quality there. I await something with the impact of a really danceable, 2012, Impossible Princess level work in terms of a stand out.
1594489505|5.0|A comparison of The Kite Runner vs. A Thousand Splendid Suns:     I thought that I would like A Thousand Splendid Suns even more than The Kite Runner, since it was about women. I did think that it was an excellent book, just not quite as good as The Kite Runner.    I think for me, what was lacking was the complexity and depth. A Thousand Splendid Suns was moving, but a straightforward story. The good guys were good and the bad guys were bad. Whereas in The Kite Runner, decent people did bad things for complicated reasons, reasons that made us understand and forgive them. The characters were psychologically complex and had many layers to their personalities, and to the relationships and interactions between them. And the whole book was a complex study of morality and ethics: how and why do we betray people we love, what do we owe those we've betrayed, and especially, can we find a way to be good again? The Kite Runner really made me think, and A Thousand Splendid Suns was just an interesting read.    That being said, it WAS a very interesting read.  Whenever I put the book down, I couldn't wait to come back to it.  I liked the characters and cared about what would happen to them.  And both books created an exceptionally vivid picture of life in Afghanistan, and especially the homes of the main characters and some of the places they visited.  I don't usually pay enough attention to description, but in both of these books, I could see the settings as clearly as if I were there.     I recommend both books highly.  You will enjoy them most if you read A Thousand Splendid Suns first - save the best for last and you won't be disappointed in A Thousand Splendid Suns.
B002VPE1XY|4.0|This case is well-made and does not look cheap, although that doesn't mean it looks expensive either.  It's definitely a step up from the usual carry case you get with an electronic and definitely better than anything you'd buy on the streets of NYC.  The leather is soft and the stitching is well done and plentiful.  The nice thing about the belt loop is that because of the velcro, you don't have to slide the case onto your belt - it wraps around your belt and is held firmly by the leather/velcro strap.  The thing I like least about the case is that the 'Amazon Basics' brand is embossed on the little metal square on the front.  I'd prefer if it was just a clean little square.  Otherwise, if you need a case, this is a fine purchase.
B000E33W1W|4.0|There's a reason why this supernatural comedy was, and still is, highly successful. It's not only because of the memorable cast and creative story, but also the witty dialogue. The dialogue is probably the best thing about Ghostbusters. Much of the lines said by the main & supporting characters are comic gold. Murray's lines are especially memorable (who could forget \\"He SLIMED me?\\"). But it's not only the characters and dialogue that are brilliant: the special effects, the ghosts, the famous song by Ray Parker Jr. However, if there's one thing that's wrong with the movie, then I have to say that Murray seems to steal the show a bit too much. He has the meatiest dialogue, and I just wished the other characters had an equal amount of witty dialogue. But that's only one of my very few gripes with this movie (the others being more trivial). Ghostbusters is a wildly entertaining comedy, and it deserves to be popular.<br /><br />Grade: B+

0143118420|3.0|I was rather enjoying this book, self-indulgent or not, until the moment the author made disparaging remarks about George W. Bush.  Then, for me, she became no more than one of the hordes of KoolAid drinkers.  Why a woman on a journey of self-disclosure and \\"wisdom\\" succumbs to the pop culture compulsion to blame George Bush for everything from the disappearance of the DoDo Bird, through the VietNam Conflict all the way to Obama's current mess is a mystery.  Further, such stupid, ill-considered declarations reduce anyone, in my estimation, to the likes of Natalie Mains.  I put the book in my Goodwill bag.  I am just glad that I was given the book and didn't waste my own hard-earned, taxed-to-death-for-the-benefit-of-those-who-depend-on-Big-Government money on it.
030745455X|5.0|Wait until you have 2 days to devote to this book, if you try to read it in stages it will make you crazy and spoil everything else. One of the best writers and the best middle book of a triligy I have ever read!
0790742780|5.0|This is one of my favorites. It captures the horror of living and continuing to see annoying everyday things which begins to be like living in a nightmare. A divorced, ex-military man who has a tendency towards severe anger and violence suddenly snaps when waiting in the heat of the day in stand-still traffic. He leaves the car and walks home. This starts his journey spanning the entirety of the movie. He is empowered by this sudden refusal to obey the law and do something that only someone would think about and never do. He is unafraid, seeking justice and moves further into the land of no return with every harrowing situation he keeps finding himself in. He frightens away a group of muggers, and he holds up a fast food store just to have a heated conversation with the owner about wanting to be served breakfast three minutes after noon.   This character's anger towards the world is something which everyone has a little of, but probably doesn't express it to the extent Michael Douglas does. It is a beautiful, harrowing and sometimes hilarious movie. Too many movies are empty with nothing to leave the viewer to think about. This movie, while not in the mainstream popularity (which I gauge how I think I will like a movie) leaves you with a powerful aftershock for a week.
B0039TD826|5.0|The ubiquitous term for the Stones is the \\"Greatest Rock Band in the World\\". well, at the time I was initially exposed to the core members, I was playing songs like \\"Some Girls\\" or should that be song off that album, the biggest song with the line \\"I was walking in Central Park, singing after dark...\\".   So, the biggest album to hit me from the Stones at the Time was TATTOO YOU. I knew TUMBLIN DICE from the duet done with Linda Ronstadt, and also the song Shine a light. So, in the 70s, I was basically all hard edge ( for me) rock. I knew the effect that the Stones had on other bands ( directly and indirectly, wether it was by those band members copying Stones Rhythm and Leads, or by having the Faces back up certain artists bands).   Probably the most impression that a few bands from the 70s had on me was that a song could be played heavy ( at the arena level) or in a cosy bar, or just busking. The plain fact is that musiciansip behind this album is awesome. Whether you hear that by using a headset, or on a 5.1 system, the mix is great.Since I never knew that SOUL SURVIVOR was a missing song, its a bonus on this cd. Whether its the staggeringly great TATTOO YOU, the Awesome UNDER COVER OF THE NIGHT or the back to basics quality in this cd, Exile on Main Street is worth a buy for the musician, the person who appreciates very good music, or someone who wants to know, \\"Whats the fuss?\\".
B003W9I9JU|1.0|I bought last weeks episode through Amazon and had no problem but I couldn't continue to watch this.  The sound was terrible.

B000TM1CL0|5.0|Shark is a sharp, well written, brilliantly acted legal drama about the baddest fish in the sea, Sebastian Stark (Woods), otherwise knows as the Shark, who leaves his high profile defense-attorney-to-the-rich gig (think Johnnie Cochran) in favor of heading up a new division of the district attorney's office.  Now instead of helping to set bad guys free, he leads a team of young, up-and-coming lawyers that puts criminals behind bars.

B002ZG980U|4.0|If Chris Nolan is not the best director around I dont know who is. His movies cause you to feel emotions & other things especially for the characters he creates. While this movie is good you might have to watch it a second time to really understand it. It didn't remind me of any James Bond movie or The Matrix it's a movie that kinda stands on it's on & it's pretty deep. The ending leaves you thinking will there be a sequel to it. But when it was all said & done...It still ain't better than The Dark Knight.
0307346617|5.0|Here's why.  I read the Zombie Survival Guide (ZSG) and it was good.  Real good.  Although it is not necessary to read the ZSG to get the full effect of World War Z (WWZ), it definitely doesn't hurt.    But.  The ZSG was (and, as of this afternoon's trip to the bookstore, still is) in the \\"Humor\\" section of most bookstores.  Easy to see why.  1) It's a guide for how to survive a zombie outbreak (pretty funny idea) and 2) this is Mel Brooks' son.    So that sets me up for my apology to Max Brooks.  Here goes    \\"I, Anthony Rodriguez, do formally and profusely apologize to you Mr. Brooks for thinking WWZ was going to be `fluff' that capitalized off your success from the ZSG.  I particularly regret thinking that the zombies would be vanquished by Bill Pullman and John Candy using the Schwartz while coming down in their Winnebago.  Please accept this apology and know that I will never doubt you again.\\"    That having been said, my one sentence summary of WWZ was that it was a [...] knock out of the park!  Let me explain.  I read the ZSG as it was pigeonholed, as humor.  There are some humorous parts in it (like the different body type classifications), but it is not ONLY humor.  To put it there is to relegate it.  But, I have to admit that I, myself, am guilty of that mental relegation.  If anything, the ZSG is a straight work of horror fiction.  WWZ is categorized as horror but is a flat out work of art.    First, the format is a recording of oral narratives of individuals who survived the zombie wars.  It is a deceptively simple but incredibly effective medium and has the power similar to reading soldiers letters from the Civil War or WWII.  There is an emotional connection here that Brooks taps into in his choice of medium.  It instantly connects the reader with the character.  With a cast of dozens of characters this is crucial for a work of this magnitude (spanning literally the entire world across several years).  This is not an accident.  I've seen other, lesserwriters attempt this format and fail miserably.  Brooks achieves this emotional connection almost effortlessly.  This is just one of many talents that showcases his true writing ability which was muted in the ZSG.  (This muting was not due to any fault of Brooks but to the relegation of the ZSG to the \\"humor\\" section.)  There are several facets to this work that make it a truly outstanding piece of fiction.  For me, the one that stands out is Brooks' ability to create a convincingly real world.  As the narrator wished, Brooks TRULY captures the \\"human element.\\"  From Todd Wainio to Sensei Tomonaga Ijiro to, of course, Paul Redeker, Brooks creates devastatingly beautiful and real people, people who have all the nuances and depth of truly great literary figures.  I found myself hating them, loving them, pitying them, and celebrating them.  I found myself in the presence of a great writer creating a great work of fiction.  So, Mr. Brooks I apologize once again for my close mindedness and promise never to again commit that sin (ya, like I can keep that promise).  I eagerly look forward to any future work you have as you are not just a great horror writer, not just a great comic writer, but a great writer.  Period.

B000NSJ4Q0|4.0|I've had the CP-E4 for a couple years now, and use it every time I go out. It adds that extra bit of power to the 580EXII to get you through the day (or shoot, as the case may be)<br /><br />It's a neat little item - an external battery pack that you keep by your side (it has a belt-loop on the carrier) and plugs into the high-voltage socket on your 580EXII (the little part covered in rubber on the side of the flash). Neat idea and very helpful (it adds an extra 8 AA's worth of power!), especially when you don't have time to change batteries (or you run out right when you need them most).<br /><br />Usage is very straightforward (just plug it in!) but it can be a bit odd to work around, when you're holding a camera on a neckstrap with an off-camera flash cable connecting it to the 580EXII and then have another cable from your belt going to the flash, but it's never been too tough to deal with.<br /><br />The benefits to the CP-E4 are faster recycle times (time from when you shoot until it's ready again) and longer battery life. Both of which are considered very important. Weight of the unit isn't too bad (depends on your definition I guess) - keep in mind it's holding 8 AA Batteries though.<br /><br />In addition to the belt loop, you can take the CP-E4 out of its case and connect it to the tripod mount of the flash. I found this to be very odd as it's longer than most (all?) Canon DSLR Batteries. On the 40D it adds a noticeable bulge and hangs off the side (and makes the camera near impossible to use in portrait mode with a battery grip). Nice option for those who don't use a battery grip on their DSLR though.<br /><br />The CP-E4 uses a slide-out magazine tray. Unlock it, pop it out, and add/remove the batteries as needed. Easier said than done, and the clips inside the magazine are known to easily break off (tip: use the hole on the bottom of the magazine to pop the batteries out to prevent the clips from breaking). Canon sells spare magazine trays: [[ASIN:B0002YE6FO Canon CPM-E3 Battery Magazine]] , but at about 1/2 the price of the battery pack (just for a plastic tray!) it's a bit of a ripoff. If you're a pro though, it's probably worth it to have a spare tray ready to go at a moments notice.<br /><br />One thing to note (I made the mistake when ordering mine alongside a 580EXII) is that it still needs 4AA in the 580EXII to operate (so you need 4 + 8 batteries - 12 total. You can't run off 4 in the flash and 4 in the CP-E4, or just 8 in the CP-E4).<br /><br />As the review title suggests, this was a great option (and still is, actually) but in the years since it's release, other manufacturers have taken the idea and improved upon it (while keeping the price at about half (or as low as 1/3rd) what the Canon branded version comes in at. Versions like the PIXEL TD-381 allow you to use either 4 or 8 batteries in the adapter, and greatly speed up recycle times (even over the canon CP-E4). While reliability has yet to be proven on these yet, early tests show it to be an all-around improvement (both in price and design). If you're looking for a tested and proven product, the CP-E4 does a very good job.

If you're looking for a tested and proven product, the CP-E4 does a very good job. If you're willing to step outside of the canon-box, check out some of the alternatives for their improvements.
B0017V7GTY|4.0|Had I heard Sink Or Swim, The Gaslight Anthem's first album, when it came out, I doubt that I would have been impressed enough to follow the band any further.<br /><br />Fortunately, The '59 Sound was the first album that I heard by the band in question. I do not remember when I first heard the song of the same title. However, I do recall being awake in the wee hours and seeing the band perform it on a Conan O'Brien rerun. Though a bit sleepy, I was awake enough to be blown away. Although the downloading bug had recently bitten me, I felt that this was worth buying on CD.<br /><br />\\"The '59 Sound\\" made it abundantly obvious to me that The Gaslight Anthem was way into Bruce Springsteen. Thus, the protagonist named Mary in \\"Great Expectations\\", the opening track, was no big surprise. This song was also an assurance that the title track was not the only good song on the album. This song's references to the narrator's \\"first wife\\" provide an ironic bit of world-weary cred because the members of the band cannot be much older than their mid-20s. (In \\"Meet Me By the River's Edge\\", Brian Fallon sings, \\"I've been here for 28 years\\", which I reckon is a clue.)<br /><br />References to 1959 and one's first wife are not the only elements on the album that obscure the band's youth. The '59 Sound abounds with references to old cars, jazz, diners, and black & white movies, sometimes generally (\\"classic cars and movie screens\\"), sometimes specifically, such as the song titles \\"Old White Lincoln\\", \\"Film Noir\\" (which describes a girl with \\"Monroe hips\\"), \\"Miles Davis & the Cool\\", and \\"Here's Looking at You, Kid\\".<br /><br />The first and most obvious instance in which the band gives away how young its members are is the quoting of the Counting Crows in \\"High Lonesome\\", which upon first hearing this then-33-year-old writer had to remind himself that the song \\"'Round Here\\" was 15 years old.<br /><br />This is not the first instance in which a song's lyrics quote an older song. In \\"Great Expectations\\", Brian Fallon sings, \\"Funny how the night moves/Humming a song from 1962.\\" Springsteen references include \\"At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet\\" and most of the aforementioned song \\"Meet Me By the River's Edge\\", which lays the Springsteen influence on pretty thick (\\"No surrender my Bobby Jean\\"). Furthermore, \\"Casanova, Baby!\\" mentions \\"Quarter To Three\\", \\"The Midnight Hour\\", and \\"Mustang Sally\\". Finally, \\"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\\" sings the praises of \\"Tom Petty songs\\".<br /><br />Such song-quoting and name-dropping forces me to make the unfortunate comparison to The Hold Steady, who--with the exception of the album Boys and Girls In America and few other songs--is one of the worst bands of the new millennium (see my reviews of their albums for specifics). The Gaslight Anthem must think that they can get away with quoting others because The Hold Steady can. This makes me cringe. However, this is the only thing that bothers me about songs that I otherwise like by The Gaslight Anthem. Most songs by The Hold Steady are terrible for a multitude of reasons.<br /><br />The Gaslight Anthem is not an exceptionally good band, and The '59 Sound is not an exceptionally good album. Nonetheless, the album delivers far more than the band's debut promised, and made me look forward its next album--which has been out for one month as these words are written--much more than Sink Or Swim would have.Funny how the night moves/Humming a song from 1962.\\" Springsteen references include \\"At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet\\" and most of the aforementioned song \\"Meet Me By the River's Edge\\", which lays the Springsteen influence on pretty thick (\\"No surrender my Bobby Jean\\").

B0000A0DRY|4.0|It's a shame this album's two hit singles haven't dated well, since that conceals how much adventurous art germinates in these songs.  The Airplane's second album stands up remarkably well to the passage of time, packed with tracks that, individually, could have rewritten the future of folk rock music.  Together, they pack a punch that hasn't been much approached in over four decades.<br /><br />Those two singles, \\"Somebody to Love\\" and \\"White Rabbit,\\" haven't become bad with time.  Rather, they remain so iconic and epoch-making that the paths they broke have been trod time and again by numberless rockers since.  Imagine how pop culture could have been shaped if overlooked classics like \\"Plastic Fantastic Lover,\\" \\"Embryonic Journey,\\" or \\"3/5 of a Mile in 10 Seconds\\" had enjoyed the same exposure in the pivotal summer of 1967.<br /><br />Remarkable for a band closely associated with the Woodstock Era, this disc includes few electric rockers.  It has a surprisingly folky sound, like an edgier Byrds backed by Carlos Santana and John Fogerty.  With its acoustic-electric hybrid sound and Summer of Love ethos, listening to this album leaves me nostalgic for times before I was born.  And I know I'm not alone, since I hear hints of this album in acts as diverse as Gomez and Brooks & Dunn.<br /><br />Not that this album is perfect.  The reverb effects (which Jeff Tamarkin's booklet notes say divided the group) make some tracks sound like they were recorded at the far end of a Quonset hut.  \\"My Best Friend\\" and \\"How Do You Feel\\" sound like zygotes of songs that needed time to gestate.  And, no offense to reissue producer Bob Irwin, I hear too clearly why the band shelved the bonus tracks during post-production.<br /><br />But most of this album remains so crisp and precise, two generations later, that I can listen to it time and again without ever getting tired of it.  I like the Beatles and the Grateful Dead, but when I imagine how great it must have been to be young and full of life in 1967, this album forms the soundtrack to my daydreams.  Such an act of beauty we've heard too rarely in recent decades.rms the soundtrack to my daydreams.  Such an act of beauty we've heard too rarely in recent decades.
B002ZG997C|5.0|First of all, I am glad that the trailer doesn't give out too much. I know people are coming after that book. But the movie is a whole lot more than that. I first thought that this is another I Am Legend. No, it is not even close.  And when I am watching the movie, I thought that this is something like Mad Max. No, it is not either. This is a very good action adventure fairy tale flick. The surprise is at the end of the movie. It explains why the Sun is so gray and the world is so sandy. Jackie (*or* Solara if you must) is so cute in this movie. Denzel Washington is the same Denzel Washington from all his other movies. Gary Oldman is the same crazy Zorg from The Fifth Element; absolutely no Commissioner Gordon here.    I first thought this movie is a cheesy flick but it is not.  5 stars must see!
B00008J2PG|5.0|This movie was mentioned by our priest during  one of his homilies.  I immediately set out to  search for the \\"Scarlet and the Black\\" and found  it on the internet.

1573229725|4.0|Suspense thriller and love story; fair maidens and dastardly villains; country estate and insane asylum;  den of thieves and literary purists; murder and mayhem in Victorian London; Sarah Waters manages to blend it all and produce one whale of a story that had me gulping it ravenously into the night, coming up for air only when it was done.  One wild caper with more twists and turns than you can imagine.<br /><br />The protagonist, Susan Trinder is an orphan child whose only knowledge of her mother is the London gallows she can see from her window where, she is told, her mother was hung, not long after Susan's birth.  She is being raised by Mrs. Sucksby, matriarch of a den of thieves, or fingersmiths.  As a teenager, Sue agrees to help Mrs. Sucksby and her friend, the wily \\"Gentleman,\\" in a scheme that will leave all three of them wealthy.<br /><br />Maud Lilly lives with her uncle in the country at Briar Estate, where she spends hours assisting him in his library.  She may enjoy wealth, but she lives a miserable existence.<br /><br />It is the intersection of these two lives that provides the impetus that drives the narrative forward and enables the author to engage the reader in the tangled web that she so cleverly constructs.  And clever may be an understatement because just when you think you know where the plot is going, bam, it twists in a completely different direction.  Twists, turns, up, down, back around until you finally come to the conclusion.  Throughout the process, Waters describes the life and times of Victorian London in the starkest terms possible:<br /><br />\\"At last I wake and do not sleep again.  The dark has eased a little.  There has been a street-lamp burning, that has lit the threads of the bleached net scarf hung at the window; now it is put out.  The light turns filthy pink.  The pink gives way, in time, to a sickly yellow.  It creeps, and with it creeps sound--softly at first, then rising in a staggering crescendo: crowing cocks, whistlesand bells, dogs, shrieking babies, violent calling, coughing, spitting, the tramp of feet, the endless hollow beating of hooves and the grinding of wheels.  Up, up, up it comes, out of the throat of London.\\" (Page 367)<br /><br />Waters puts you right there in Dickens' London.  Wonderful read.  Very  highly recommended.

B003JSSPSY|5.0|When zapping through the sad German Sunday afternoon program, I accidently stumbled over the show. I think it was in the middle of the episode 'hunger' of season 2, when Cara was just kicking some evil b_tts. :) Having not seen the first season at all and the start of that episode, of course I didn't get it all. However I was immediately infected by the sympathetic actors and the acting. It's kind of like Xena and Hercules, but generally more serious and not so comedy-like. The nevertheless much available humor is situation comic without getting silly. (And no mistake, Xena and Hercules are real fun to watch!) - I sincerely hope that this show will get further seasons. It really would be a shame to throw this away ...
B003JYOFIW|5.0|Yes,...Yes!!!  This is what us Devo fans have been waiting for for a very long time.  This new Devo release has that sound of their earlier recordings which fall right in the catagories of \\"Freedom Of Choice\\", \\"New Traditionalists\\", and Oh, no! It's Devo!\\".  \\"Something For Everybody\\" could have been released in the early 80's and would have fit perfectly in that time era.  This music sounds fresh for 2010, and the world needs to hear, listen, and understand what Devo is all about.

B0037A4ILC|5.0|This was a great viewing experience. It tells the story of the race to summit a certain mountain in the late 1930s just as Germany began to reassert itself throughout the world. Several aspects made this movie great.  First, its very visceral - you really feel as if you're trekking up the mountain with these guys; you feel their fear, their pain and they hopes. The camerawork is great, and there's a few scenes where the downward view of the mountain is clearly portrayed in a, frankly, terrifying way. Second, the movie is a great peek into the social/nationalistic sentiments of pre-WWII Germany. The ascent of the mountain is viewed as an opportunity to demonstrate German pride as reporters swoon in to capture the story and laud the hopeful Germans as the conquerors. Its also a great period piece; strong work on recreating the feel (costumes, music, architecture, design, etc.).  Overall, very highly recommended.
B000068FXR|5.0|This is my favorite Supertramp album, probably because it leaves space for the instrumentals.  One of my favorite albums period.  I was hooked when I heard \\"Another Man's Woman\\" on the radio (I remember which block of which street it was) and was blown away by the series of developments that go on through the long second half of the song.    There is a great trick they pull with the song \\"All Things Bright and Beautiful\\" in \\"A Soapbox Opera\\"-- who would have thought you could make an old song that much prettier by coming in on the wrong beat?    I love the Dixieland-like clarinet and sax parts on the second, er, side of the album, it's always struck me that there's true love in the playing there.    I've never figured out whether we're supposed to laugh at the most pathetic lyrics or take them seriously.  But the music makes it totally worthwhile.
0143118420|1.0|You'd think I'd like this book, since it promises to be both a travelogue and a spiritual journal. I love traveling, and I've spent most of my life studying and exploring spirituality. But no. Ms. Gilbert spends her hundreds of pages complaining about her life -- hating the same things that I've always wanted and would give a lot to have: she takes it for granted. Spending a whole year abroad, on someone else's dime? It was stressful and confusing. Hot sexual relationships with not one, but two, attractive men? She felt \\"smothered.\\" She couldn't find her \\"voice,\\" even though she was already a published author before this story began, and the book itself is basically her travel blog. Insights about the countries she visited? None. Advice for anyone who wants to duplicate her experience? None. Spiritual insights? None. This book is a complete waste of time for anyone other than self-absorbed entitled whiners seeking for validation. Oh wait -- that's most middle class American voters. No wonder it was a bestseller. One of the worst books I've ever read.  If there's anybody out there who will pay me to travel the world for a year and write about it, I'd love to. I have three graduate degrees and I'm a good writer. I've traveled extensively, but it's all been at my expense. What do I have to do to get Gilbert's deal? Or her prejourney life, even?
B001S86J5S|3.0|This Blu-Ray disk is well worth the money for being under $10.00.  Decent enough extras; however, the \\"Wild Thing\\" edition means nothing.  The film is very good quality visually and it has great audio.  As long as it stays inexpensive, I would recommend.
B002ZG980U|5.0|I intentionally kept myself in the dark about most of the plot of this movie, and I am glad I did so.  Accordingly, I will not spoil the movie in this review.<br /><br />Anyone who has seen the trailers knows that the film involves people in dreams, and Christopher Nolan does a great job of not only providing the rules for how dreams work on the individuals in dreams, but finds very interesting ways of using those rules.<br /><br />The acting is very strong, and features a team of different specialists, each with a role to play in the dreams.<br /><br />Nolan keeps the action at the forefront, and at times, I lost track of trying to keep it all straight in my head.  Fortunately, the director sees the audience through, so just hod on and ride out the action scenes on top of action scenes.<br /><br />The effects are stunning.  I can't say enough about them.<br /><br />Most of all, in an era of moviemaking that seems to consist only of remakes and sequels, Inception brings some original ideas.  There are certainly elements of other films, notably the Matrix, Dreamscape, and the Thirteenth Floor to name a few. Nevertheless, this is a fresh and well-executed concept.<br /><br />There are a number of creative ideas which you will think about after leaving the theater.  I suspect that I may need to see it again to figure out exactly what intricacies I missed, but if you pay attention, this film is well worth the investment of time and energy.
0575081961|5.0|An exelent story, writen by a man fighting his own battle with age, one las hurrah for the last hero on the Disk, whom the gods have let grow old...
0393072231|4.0|Mike Burry began his professional career as a doctor -- brilliant and driven, yet unable to look anyone in the eye due to his own childhood loss of one -- but soon became disenchanted with the healing profession. He moved on to his next obsession: the bond market. After creating Scion Capital, a hedge fund, he quickly became involved with buying up a new product called credit default swaps or insurance on bonds created from sub-prime mortgages. Mike Burry is just one of the key players in Michael Lewis's chronicle of the Wall Street debacle that precipitated the US financial crisis of 2008/2009.<br /><br />For someone who began his career as a investment analyst at Salomon Bros., Lewis is a master story craftsman; and what a story he has here to tell. I barely understand a thing about Wall Street, and Stock Exchanges; not to mention derivatives, CDO's, credit default swaps, and AAA rated tranches, but Lewis really piqued my interest. Suddenly, I was enthralled with the stories of Steve Eisman, Greg Lippman, Vincent Daniel, and other bond traders, hedge fund analysts, et al. It is fascinating as Lewis reveals how everything converged into a perfect storm of doom for Wall Street and the US economy. How, among others, the rating agencies (Moody's, Standard and Poor\\"s) the fed chairman (Greenspan), and key investment banks (Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns, etc...) all contributed to the downfall of not only US but world markets.<br /><br />After reading The Big Short, I still do not purport to understand how everything in the financial world works, but I am a hell of a lot more informed; informed enough to stay away from Wall Street investments for now, and to highly recommend this or any other book by Michal Lewis. In the Epilogue, Lewis tells of his recent lunch with his old boss at Salomon Brothers, John Gutfreund. He hadn't seen him since he had quit Wall St years before and had been asked to explain to the CEO his exotic dealings in derivatives with a European hedge fund. When Liar's Poker, Lewis's first book which exposes Gutfreund and Salomon Brothers, came out, Gutfreund told the press he'd never met Michael Lewis. Gutfreund was later forced to resign as CEO of Salomon. At the lunch, after some formalities, the discussion turned nostalgic. Gutfreund says:<br /><br />  \\"'I think we can agree about this: your f***ing book destroyed my career and it made yours.' with that the former king of a former Wall Street lifted the plate that held his appetizer and asked, sweetly, 'would you like a deviled egg?'\\"<br /><br />And it is sweet, in this case, to hear the vanquished offering up to the victor, the spoils; even if it only is a deviled egg.<br /><br />~Book Jones~ 4 Starsd.

B001NLKWLW|3.0|while the book has an interesting premise,and promise of a lovely story, listening to the audio version of the book was confusing. Leaping years with each chapter,back and forth,took a toll on my interest and the novel was frilly with too many unnecessary words.  A bit of trimming here and there would have lightened the load without harm to character or story line.  If this is the style of this author, I won`t put myself through it again any time soon.
B0015DROBO|3.0|The reviews right on the book cover call it the very definition of a page-turner. Well, I kept turning the pages all right, mostly in hopes of getting to that breathless page-turning stuff. I suppose there were, finally, a few pages of suspense, but never for very long, and never of the real teeth-clenching variety.<br /><br />I agree with the reviewers who were left scratching their heads wondering what all the hype is about. It's a nice journeyman effort, featuring one unusual, semi-fleshed-out character and a lot of cardboard cutouts. For readers used to complex, post-modern literature dealing with big themes, deep characterizations, and some angst that actually registers in your gut, this little Swedish skit will seem naive, old-fashioned, unchallenging and quaintly Scandinavian (although hardly of an Igmar Bergman-existential variety). I was bothered by at least a few instances of sloppy logic created in apparent haste, and by the fact that revenge is wreaked by our heroes on their wicked foes to such facile, complete, 50's comic book satisfaction that one feels just a little bit embarrassed for the author's neat-and-tidy, obsessive-compulsive disorder. And at the back of the book, the preview of the next volume in the series suggests to me that Larsson may enjoy composing scenes of torture and sadism just a little too much.<br /><br />All-in-all, a modest achievement mostly indistinguishable from a million other pieces of mediocre fiction.

B000002IGV|4.0|Twisted Sister is often a touchstone for people who rip on classic `80's hair metal; the simplicity of sound, immaturity of the lyrics and the glam looks of the band. However before commercialism and MTV oversaturated the band on a fickle American fan base, the Sisters were a darn good hard rock band and worthy to stand alongside their contemporaries. The band's third album defined their career and remains a cherished memory from that era. `Stay Hungry' built on the momentum of a career saving two year sojourn in the UK to take advantage of the NWOBHM movement and it proved to be the catalyst that these long time veterans of the New York club scene needed to jump start a stagnant existence.  \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\" was easily a `80s classic with its iconic video and anthemic message of teenage rebellion. Follow up single \\"I Wanna Rock\\" almost did as well and the LP easily went multi-platinum and pushed garish but talented frontman Dee Snider into millions of living rooms across the country.  Snider may have looked like an utter buffoon but he was no joke and his charisma grabbed for attention. The rest of `Stay Hungry' is very good as well with \\"The Price\\", the title track, \\"SMF\\", \\"Burn in Hell\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Down\\".  If you love this era of music or are wondering what the fuss was all about then you could do a lot worse than `Stay Hungry'...call for Street Justice!

B002VPE1AW|2.0|I cannot belive how much hype this movie received when its core has been done so many times before and better.  They stole almost the entire plot from Dances With Wolves and then set it in space, added amazing special effects and expected us to eat it up.  Looks like more everyone did based on the boxoffice.  But then again, most of us are like sheep heading to the slaughter.  Great entertainment, with a very heavy dose of liberal morality.

GaGa streamed the same success with `Paparazzi' and `LoveGame' being released as further singles, which were close to hitting #1 as well, but settling for a Top 5 charting instead. What started out as The Fame re-release, turned out to be GaGa's sophomore serving with The Fame Monster, centered on the concepts of loneliness, love, death, fear, sex and alcohol, omitting her obvious themes of fame and money; hence the title of her first album.    GaGa partners with RedOne again for Monster, also adding Darkchild, to bring the uptempos in the same vein as her previous singles (the aforementioned) and despite the songs being great and indulging, they do not bring anything new to the table from GaGa but catchy hooks, partly unchanged electro beats at different tempos and of course, different lyrics.    The EP reaffirms a pattern in GaGa's writing style of stuttering the first syllable or letter from words or the title itself in the tracks choruses, manifested in `Just Dance', `Poker Face', `Eh Eh (Nothing Else I can Say)' and `Paparazzi', which is also major in most of the new 8 track album, such as `Monster', `Alejandro', `Telephone', `So Happy I Could Die' and `Bad Romance' (pretty much the whole track listing); the latter being extremely reminiscent of `Poker Face', even in the opening chant.    Beyoncé's feature is needless, and the persistent dashes of sex and fashion are okay to a point but then become overestimated. The production is intense and gigantic, but yet again do not contribute to anything new, which was what The Fame originally did when it was released in mid 2008.      Standouts are the vicious and boisterous first single `Bad Romance' for its frolic connotations, `Monster', the apparent odeto masturbation and club pulsating `So Happy I Could Die' and `Alejandro' for its tint of Ace of Base. It also has its hidden gems in `Speechless' and `Teeth'. `Speechless' is a piano rock-a-fied ballad dedicated to her father. It features great songwriting and in fact showcases GaGa's vocal talent at its best. She sounds raw and pours all her frustrated emotion over her piano and the listener, while `Teeth' finds GaGa trying out a pounding aggressive edgy sound, which is a breath of fresh air after the rampant re-do of The Fame.       GaGa's continual talent is unquestionable, her vocals are flawless and her piano playing exquisite, but The Fame Monster aside from being pleasant and addictive, shows no sign of growth. Putting `Teeth' aside, there is nothing which sets The Fame apart from the EP, which allegedly stands as a second album; it is too formulaic. The eight tracks could have easily been part of the first record or bonus tracks as a re-release instead of labeling it as her next piece of work. The only thing which obstructs people from noticing is the visual treatment given to both the singles and the artist itself, which involve a lot of input and `ceiling-less' budgets. Without doubt the album is fun, catchy with a slight alternate perception and GaGa's delivery is superb, but it emphasizes style more than substance.    C.Perez
B001OQCV2E|2.0|I like a good destruction film now and then.  I'm easy to please - I liked Dante's Peak.  So when I rented this film, my expectations were low.  I was just looking to be mindlessly entertained.  It had all the makings of a good disaster film: good actors, interesting sub-plots, and lots of special effects (or CG).  But I found this film to be rather disappointing.  According to the ratings, more people hated it than loved it.  In trying to figure out why it was such a disappointment to me and maybe others, I could say the makers of this film insulted our intelligence over and over again in order to supposedly create suspense.  There are too many examples to cite, but primarily the special effects were so over the top and unbelievable that I couldn't buy into it.  In order to entertain, the makers of a film have to make you believe that what you are seeing could actually happen, even for a second.  It wasn't the CG on the destruction that I didn't believe; that was pretty good.  It was how the main characters of the film just barely escaped demise every turn of the way.  Too unbelievable to be fully entertaining.  Bottom line: this film is watchable and mildly entertaining, but suffers from sappy sub-plots and over the top special effects that insult your intelligence.

B003IPC5SO|5.0|Aphrodite finds Kylie Minogue celebrating the dancefloor, addressing recurrent themes of love and sexuality as well as returning to form after the substantial experimentation present in 2007's X. It also marks Minogue's second attempt at cracking the North American market since 2001 with the release of Fever.    The album has a very fierce undertone (most blatant in the title track, which interpolates a rock tinge), but throws in subtlety in tracks like `Closer', `Everything is Beautiful' and `Illusion', which give a sense of vulnerability to the record, most shockingly in `Too Much', one of the album's club thumping moments as she conveys, \\"I don't know what we're going through...It's too much, the way I feel about you..\\". It holds the dichotomy of being fiery yet delicate, conveying ease but at the same time inviting the listener to move, accomplishing versatility yet cohesiveness. Albeit the album is mainly dance-pop, it somehow manages to reflect some sort of emotion without being shallow meaningless pop music but instead coming across as delightful and empowering to a certain extent. It even has an organic feel despite being consistently electro, and allows the piano, violin and cellos to shine in the midst of electrifying beats.    Some of the track breakdowns are quite experimental (i.e. Cupid Boy, Put your Hands Up, Can't Beat the Feeling), which before slowing down faintly, explode aggressively picking up the pace once more, transcending the tracks to another level. What Stuart Price did, record production wise, is just brilliant. Some of the tracks are growers, but this does not hold them from being astounding. `Get Outta My Way' can be considered the new `Love at First Sight' without being ripped off in the slightest, and is a classic in the making.    Surprisingly the skip button is not an option for Aphrodite as all the tracks are enjoyable. It is hard to pick a favorite; each track flows well and each stand on its own. None sound similar nor recycled,common when working with one producer, but on the contrary sound fresh, energetic, fun and `euphoric' (as Kylie described the album herself). The album is blissful to the core and maintains an indescribable vibe all throughout; it leaves the listener on a high and wanting more after the closing number.    Aphrodite is a cross between Light Years and Fever; it incorporates the heavy retro disco predominant in her 2000 release and the vivacity and flirt of its successor. The influence of two of her best works put into one just equals a certified smash.    The album is one whole unstoppable bouncy mix with impeccable production. The songwriting is neither deep nor poetical (though the clever innuendos between love and the dancefloor itself are worth mentioning), but it does the trick for a fun pop album filled with club stompers and `dancey' midtempos alongside soothing vocals. This is Kylie at her best.    C.Perez
B003FMTZOM|1.0|Why are people even mentioning Lady Gaga?  I suggest you listen to Gaga's music before you say that Christina is trying to copy her.  Gaga's music is danceble and funky, while this music defies logic.  Don't get me wrong, I like Cristina, but she really needs to get some positive input from producers and hre record company. This music is shrill and unlistenable.  Start over Xtina, please.
0393324818|3.0|This book argues that the Oakland A's, by hewing to a few simple principles based on statistics, were able to do very well in the early 2000s despite having less money to play with than other teams.  Like most reporting, it suffers from a lack of long-term perspective.  That is, even though it seems to explain why the A's did well at the time the book was written, it fails to explain why the A's declined in more recent years.  I'm sure that if Lewis were writing about the A's today, he would have written a more complex and accurate book (though I have no idea whether his conclusions would have differed).
B00005B364|5.0|This is an excellent cd. One that ant true rock and roll lover can appreciate and should have. Amazon was quick to get it to me. No complaints here.
B0010SKTRA|5.0|This is one of my favorite science books I have read in years.  Not only does Shubin go into the best possible explanation of the evolution of all species, but, perhaps more importantly, [i]how[/i] we know that.  I found the descriptions of finding fossils in the layers of the earth that the teams expected to be the most compelling case on the predictive powers of the theory of evolution.  The details of how parts of the human body formed weren't just informative, but fun, and enjoyable for someone who understands evolutionary theory or someone who is new to understanding it.    A few months after reading this book, I went to the zoo and felt like a kid again.  Instead of just looking at the differences and interesting things about animals, I was in awe at all the similarities.  Your Inner Fish gave me a whole new appreciation for science, evolutionary theory, and all of life on earth.
B000KJTC5A|2.0|I tried two different players, it wouldn't play on one and played poorly on the other. The quality on the one that would play it was very poor. A very poor reproduction. The video was dark and the audio was poor as well. It looked like a hijacked version. I sent it back and Amazon replaced it, but the problem was also in the second disk.  I returned the second disk as well and the Amazon credited my account for both disks. I was satisfied with Amazon's response, but disappointed with the product, because I'm a big John Wayne fan.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|This is my second favorite guitar rock album, and is my absolute favorite Progressive Rock guitar album.  Second only to Robin Trower's \\"Bridge of Sighs\\" album.<br /><br />\\"Telegraph Road\\" is a song about a lone drifter who set up camp and took advantage of the natural luxuries of the environment (water, natural vegetation, and climate), and as other drifter's passed by, they too, decided to set up camp and stay, and as the years went by, this small camp form into a small city where the population grew and a railroad track was to pass through to recognize the establishment of a new found city.  That's just the first track.  Nearly fifteen minutes worth.<br /><br />The next track, \\"Private Investigations\\" was to give you the dark ambiance of the mysterious, questionable, nuances of being a private detective.  You get the \\"black and white\\" feel of the old film noir of the silver screen era of the private detective.  The guitar work here is so awesome!<br /><br />Then you get \\"Industrial Disease\\", a low charted single from this album, but yet I have yet to see it added to a \\"best of\\" Dire Straits collection. It's kind of a \\"tongue in cheek\\" approach to your insignificance as an employee of a major factory or corporation.  I'm thinking that they keep avoiding to put this song on a greatest hits CD because they probably want you to buy this album directly instead.  And I agree that you should.  The remaining title track and \\"It Only Rains\\" is typical Dire Straits material.  But to me, the first three tracks are classic recordings!  There wasn't that much material this good in the eighties.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong.  I love eighties pop.  But this album qualifies as a late Progressive Rock album.  Progressive Rock is most recognized during the early seventies.  This album supports a dead, by-gone era that many of us old fossils still cherish as rock's better days.
B002VECLVY|5.0|It's an art to portray the subtlety of relationships and love, particularly when it is taboo.  I loved this movie for its dignity, intelligence and insightful message.  The acting was magnificent, the characters endearing, and the story unforgetable.  Thanks to everyone who brought this movie to life.
B0039SFKSW|4.0|Falsetto vocals.  The story of a tragic romance with a lesbian.  Children dancing barefoot in the moonlight.  Assurances that God is love and that love is the key to happiness.  Fast pop tempos and spacey, high-octave synthesizer riffs.  Promises of \\"semper fidelis\\" to one's beloved.  Sexual innuendo, but more cutesy than Kiss-like.  This is Asia?    My brother and I were fans from early on, but mostly lost interest after John Wetton left (although John Payne's Asia did put out a handful of interesting tunes).  So we were quite pleased to hear some years ago that the original Asia had reformed and was recording again.  We both enjoyed [[ASIN:B00154GEFU Phoenix]], although it was apparent that things had changed from the glory days.  With OMEGA, things have changed even more.  We were listening to Omega the other day, first time for my brother, when he said \\"I'm not sure what their marketing plan is for this\\".  Just who is the target audience?    After a while, it struck me.  This one is meant to interest women of any age above the Taylor Swift crowd.  Quite interesting - an aging supergroup whose former audience demographic, i.e. young men, have long abandoned Asia's bombastic, high-intensity prog/rock musical style.  You can't go home again.  But your lead singer still has an angelic voice, your keyboard man has a techno-pop heritage, and the guitar and drum guys have enough talent to adapt to anything.  So you try some different directions and write songs about love, devotion, loss, sensuality, spirituality and feelings.  You make sure the words will thank the someone-special in a man's life, or savor her memory.  Yes, I believe that's the marketing plan.      OK, Omega wasn't produced exclusively for guys who turned to Asia in 1982 when Yes and ELP had seemingly lost their creative muse. But it still offers us enough to make Omega worth a listen.  Actually, many of the songs are quite good; but they are not in the style that we will remember Asia for.  I could only imagine two songs that could have appeared on [[ASIN:B000000OMB Asia]] or [[ASIN:B000000OXH Alpha]].  Those would be Through My Veins and There Was a Time.  Finger on the Trigger is a standard rocking album-opener, and Ever Yours is a rehash of elements from Heroine and I Will Remember You from Phoenix (but I personally liked  those songs, so I don't really mind).      Holy War brings back the old anti-war message and socially-involved lyrics, but the music behind it is not the usual brooding, ELP-like dirge; it's more happy and snappy, making for an odd mix.  Listen Children and Light The Way continue the up-tempo pop trend.  End of the World seems to bring back the pompous contemplation of a world gone wrong (e.g. Rock and Roll Dream and Countdown to Zero from ASTRA), but then turns to love as the answer.  I Believe is part 2 to this theme.  I'm Still the Same could be used in one of those old \\"follow the bouncing ball\\" sing-along shows of long ago.  The mood behind the opening lines of Don't Wanna Lose You Now reminds me of  Starbuck's Moonlight Feels Right, but Asia still hasn't used a xylophone (although Moonlight's synthesizer refrains are similar to some of Geoff's work on Omega).     And then there's Emily, the story of the girlfriend who ultimately \\"bats for the other side\\".  Many reviewers don't like this tune, calling it \\"Beatles-esque\\"; probably from the bouncy piano intro.  And yet, Steve Howe later adds a nice guitar break, and the last 40 seconds or so sound like the fade-out from Open Your Eyes.  Thus, the music is just as confused and bittersweet as the relationship.    So this one is different from the old Asia groove, more \\"sensitive\\", more Barry Mantilow.   Phoenix was heading in that direction, but Omega seems to have crossed  the line.  And yet, many of the elements that made us prog guys love Asia in the first place are still there.  You still hear an occasional echo of the past, close your eyes and say . .  . Yes.   Omega, like Phoenix, isa John Wetton album.  But Geoff Downes comes in a close second; his keyboard work leads along new paths (new for Asia, anyway).  Steve Howe is third in overall influence, but the quality of his guitar work keeps this album from fermenting into cheese.  And Carl Palmer is there, drumming skillfully and vigorously but with few opportunities to show off his power, as in the old days.      I hope the new marketing strategy works, as it is good to have the original Asia team out there.  Omega is still worth a listen, even if you are a (sole) survivor of the old marketing strategy.
B0001I561E|2.0|The movie came in a timely manner and it will work for us.  I have two little kids and they dont care that it looks to be a copy and not a disney original.  The movie was shrunk wrapped but didn't have the tape type stuff on the inside that disney does nor did it have the same look.  The lable on the disk looks pigmented more than a real copy and I am pretty sure it is not really a disney copy but, it works for us and the movie plays fine.  It may have a little more red pigment than the original but I am unsure on that.  My son plays with our TV settings so when we watched it he may have just played with the buttons and my husband may have fixed it since.  Im not too concerned as you can tell.  Good enough for a 2 and 4 year old!
B000SQKZKG|5.0|Emerson Lake and Palmer were one of those bands who were more concerned about how they sell themselves \\"live\\" more so then what that sold on vinyl.  I saw ELP three times in my life.  Twice in 1977 in Detroit.  Once with the orchestra (Works Tour 1977), and then around Christmas the same years as the intended trio that they were.  I guess they nearly went broke when they toured with the orchestra and so Greg and Carl both blame Keith for the expensive touring concept.<br /><br />But, their tour was memorable.  I'm proud to say that I saw them, even though I'm not too impressed with the \\"Works Live\\" CD that came out a few years back.  And even the DVD of \\"Works Orchestral Tour\\" is nothing to get excited about (the video quality is quite horrid), but it still represents an important part of Progressive Rock history, and I was there!  Yeah Buddy!<br /><br />Anyway, this live performance was during their 1973 and 1974 World Tour.  They were obviously at their peak because this concert represents the best of their first five albums.  Their classic first albums.  Well, wait a minute.  I guess nothing from \\"Pictures at an Exhibition\\" was represented here, but they definitely covered their most important four studio albums quite well here.<br /><br />\\"Emerson, Lake, and Palmer\\" (\\"Take a Pebble\\", \\"Lucky Man\\"), Tarkus (\\"Tarkus\\", \\"Jeremy Bender\\"), \\"Trilogy\\" (\\"Hoedown\\", \\"The Sheriff\\") and especially the latest album at the time \\"Brain Salad Surgery (\\"Jerusalem\\", \\"Toccata\\", \\"Still...You Turn Me On\\", and all of \\"Karn Evil Nine\\").<br /><br />Out of all the concerts available on CD or DVD, or even performed in concert, I never heard a live performance of \\"Trilogy\\" (My favorite ELP track), \\"Abaddon's Bolero\\", \\"The Endless Enigma\\", or \\"The Only Way/Infinite Space\\".  These are very important songs to me, and yet I've never seen or heard them performed live.<br /><br />Oh well, the closest that you're going to get to hear or see this era of ELP \\"live\\" is to get the DVD of \\"Beyond The Beginning\\" where you'll get the see ELP live at the California Jam in 1974.<br /><br />I don't know if the Shout Factory made a better remastered recording of this CD.

B003N5VOUO|1.0|Karan Johar is one of the worse popular filmmakers in Indian cinema. I'm bewildered by his popularity. I guess casting SRK in every film helps since SRK fans go to see him in some of the worse films.         I don't know how to say how bad this film is.  How does someone take a serious subject and make a joke of it. There are so many WTF moments in this film.  1983 listed as the year when Hindu-Muslim riots took place in Mumbai? Huh? SRK's Rizwan ventures into a make-believe Georgia town in the South where the African-American folks act and behave in a manner that made me wonder if Rizwan had time-travelled as well! Straight out of a 50s film then, Mama Jennie (stereotypically Big Momma) and her son Funny Hair Joel (oh, come on) offer Rizwan shelter and women's dressing. In return, he mouths an eulogy that makes those present sing an acapella to the tune of Hum Honge Kamyaab! Rizwan is back on his journey following this WTF diversion. But there are plenty more WTFs in store, including one that causes him to return to Big Momma's ole town and rescue its people from a hurricane that is curiously dangerous enough for locals to be unable to get out of it but just enough for outsiders to get in! So there are no army choppers in sight to rescue, but enough choppers to cover the rescue operation engineered by Rizwan that puts his earlier bicycle use to greater effect! See how it all comes around! Ain't it a clever screenplay? As for the acting Kajol is so screechy its like she thought she was acting in an entirely different film.  SRK plays Rizwan like a caricature of a man with Asperger disease.     I can only recommend staying far away from this film.

B003H6Z0TU|3.0|Pilar Lorengar, one of the great singers to emerge after WW2 is seen and heard here in her absolute prime. She sounds glorious, flooding out a gleaming tone, her rapid vibrato adding a very sexy shimmer. She also looks young, beautiful if zaftig, radiates charm, sexuality, pathos in act two and is altogether wonderful.    Kertesz was one of the great conductors to emerge after that war. Sadly he died young in a strange swimming accident (thinking one of his children was drowning he plunged impulsively into the water, and himself drowned, the child was safe). All of his gifts are manifest here. Though he has the ripe, rich Vienna Philharmonic in the pit, he restrains the strings, allowing a wonderful balance of wood to string tone; he has buoyant rhythms, his tempos are infectious and both long finales are lovingly shaped with elegant phrases and superb line.    Lorengar and Kertesz both made many recordings but to experience them visually in a live performance, one where everything works perfectly for them is valuable.    As to the first review -- well -- opinions differ in opera. And I will write this for someone who isn't so much a specialist with decided opinions but would be interested in a good Magic Flute.    Contrary to that review, b&w is a problem. The sets are meant to show a riot of color, suggesting fairy tale locations. But in b&w with elevated lightening levels to facilitate TV, they are flattened out and look cheap and flimsy, entirely without atmosphere.    Schenk, the director, had a long career but was nothing special. He gets people on and off stage appropriately, solves 'problems' (how does Papageno get his mini feast, how do the three 'boys' save Pamina from suicide) neatly, and can handle a crowd -- sort of -- people do have a way of just standing around. But he has no point of view, hadn't worked interestingly with the singers and settles for obvious business. Maybe the first reviewer is suffering from arrested development, but I've NEVER seena Flute where animals (extras in zoo costume) didn't enter at that point and this is one of the least interesting uses of them I've ever seen. More of an issue is the easy way out with Papageno's birds (none) and bells (a doodad he waves). No imagination.    Kmentt, Kreppel and Berry were all singers from the Vienna State Opera and have very solid routine -- unfortunately -- that's it. They are business like and inoffensive. Kreppel, though respectable, has the least to offer (he does have the lowest notes though). Kmentt is a well schooled lyric tenor whose pleasant voice works attractively here -- to suggest he is anywhere near the spectacular Wunderlich is ridiculous. Both these men have conservative 1960's hair -- one might have expected figures in a fairy tale to look a little more exotic (and a director with imagination would have seen to it).    Berry was the only one of these three to have an international career, though he was more famous in bass roles like Barak and Baron Ochs, tried Wotan a few times and was a Leporello and usually Don Alfonso in Cosi. He starts off fine but dull, then relaxes in his scenes in act two with his Papagena (the delightful Renate Holm). He has to fight not to laugh in one. Still, compared to a famous international Papageno of this period like Hermann Prey or the older but still functioning Erich Kunz he is ordinary.    The first reviewer is a Roberta Peters fan, good for him. She does very well, though the 'first boy' in this production is the great Lucia Popp who in a year, would explode as a fantastic Queen of the Night and make a huge international career branching out from that role to many others. Peters does not compare. And I don't know what the nonsense is about her applause -- the longest applause I heard was for Berry and Holm after their second scene.    The first reviewer did manage to overlook a great singer though -- Paul Schöffler, who appears here as 'The Speaker', a short role in act one. He was 67 at this time and went on for almost another decade. He was famous from the thirties in Germany, and world famous after the war, especially for his Hans Sachs -- a role he was still singing at this time!!! He had a huge rep. He has a marvelous presence and performs with a genuine charisma that everyone but Lorengar lacks. He has a very touching take on the role as well.    The sound is good. There is more dialog than is often the case but VAI provides English subtitles for all of it.     Obviously if you know something about these singers and this period this will deliver much that is pleasant and if you have a special interest in the great Lorengar and Kertesz in a live video document it is self recommending (it's also a rare chance to see the renowned Schöffler). Otherwise one of the more recent Flutes is a better place to start.

0439023483|1.0|Sorry to disappoint those who come here to read positive reviews about the books they and their friends love, but I refuse to pander to the unwashed masses of Amazon book reviewers. The Hunger Games is a TRULY TERRIBLE story. Suzanne Collins has perfected hack writing to an art form. And I've read Twilight; I KNOW hack writing. Terribly written, terrible story, nothing short of sickening.  Speaking of Twilight, as an aside, I noticed on the first page of Catching Fire how an Amazon reviewer was quoted as saying, \\"When I saw that this book had recommendations from Stephanie Meyer and Stephen King I knew I just had to read it and was in for a great read, and I wasn't disappointed!\\" Well, let me just say that the fact that Stephanie Meyer enjoyed the book ought to have tipped me off from the beginning: the proper place for this work of fiction was not on my bookshelf but in the trash, right alongside the burned copies of Twilight I routinely collect from secondhand stores to set alight. And as far as Stephen King, I'm shocked and saddened to think I ever had the poor taste to believe that there was one author in the world who was beyond reproach. Stephen King writes great novels, EXCELLENT novels, but I'll never pick one up again. It is entirely unforgivable for him to have promoted, in ANY shape or form, the travesty which is Collin's series.  Not long ago at the insistence of several friends I read the first book, The Hunger Games. Let me first say that books about teenagers surviving in a dystopian future are not my favorite subject matter, but I will give anything a try. I found myself at the last page of the book, somewhat unimpressed with the plot but still interested to see how Collins would wrap things up on what was literally the last page. Mild interest turned to horror and rage as I turned the page to be greeted by \\"Be sure to read the next part of the series- coming soon!\\"  In the past I have been suckered into reading books which seem innocent enough but turn out to be \\"works in progress,\\" with the next installment slated to come out in a matter of months. I was similarly burned when I read \\"The Knife of Never Letting Go,\\" by Patrick Ness. In the future I will stop judging books by their covers and ALWAYS flip to the back page to make sure they aren't part of a conspiracy, intended to let the author get away with NOT ENDING THE ----ING BOOK. It is my belief that books which in ANY way play ANY part in some twisted author's series, those books should be clearly labeled with numbers on the front, spine, and perhaps a warning on the contents page (Warning: Immediate Gratification not available until well after the author decides what direction this story will take)  Part of my rage was surely because Collins had skipped out on writing what seems like the simplest of decisions: Does Katniss end up with Gale or Peeta? It infuriates me because I don't want to have to read a whole other book just to find out what I can effectively write myself in two sentences: \\"But Katniss came to her senses and ditched Peeta. Then ran into the waiting arms of Gale and was pretty happy for the rest of her life.\\" But what really grinds my gears is that the book itself is so PERFECTLY uninteresting, there was effectively no point in ever trying to obtain and read the next one. I was sullen and disgruntled and in general not happy with the mind games Collins had played on me. I swore off her juvenile fiction and decided to get on with my life.  However, curiosity killed the cat and the hope of satisfaction brought her back. At my mother's request (This one is SO much better than the first! I think you'll like it!) I started Catching Fire this morning at 10:00 am, and finished at roughly 3:00 pm, when I started this review. The fact that the two-part series has now become a trilogy-in-progress did not faze me, as I had opened to the last page to assure myself of the fact before I started reading. What I was greeted with was nothing short of unspeakable. Why do I care about these characters still? Katniss is a gutless flip-flopper who, despite her tough exterior, is utterly incapable of making decisions or experiencing emotions other than confusion, anger, and sadness. The other characters in the books, who act as supporting roles to the \\"star\\" Katniss, are two-dimensional and never explored enough to explain why Katniss \\"loves\\" them so much, despite this being a central plot point as far as every decision Katniss does or does not make. We are just told that we should love them because Katniss loves them, and are expected to go along merrily reading without any connections to any characters, as she throws dues ex machina and unbelievable coincidences in our face. How stupid do you think we are, Collins? Eventually every over-imaginative teen and young mother who has read these books will come to their senses and realize that when all the odds are against them, unlike in book world, things probably WON'T work out for them. But then again, that's in real life, and you don't make a living working in real life, do you? At least living in a fantasy fiction world has worked out for you. So congratulations.  To all the true and serious readers out there: I know how hard it is in this day and age to get your hands on reading material which actually makes a difference in people's lives. That is why I say in warning: Don't buy this book. Don't talk about this book. Don't even THINK about this book. And when the aforementioned masses hype this trash up to the point where it becomes a movie, I hope you'll do the right thing and further refuse to support the franchise. I know it's tough, but if we work together, much like Katniss and her playing-card cast of supporting characters, we CAN up the quality of fiction in the future.  To everyone else: I hope you choke to death on your mass-produced old-growth-forest-destroying nightmare-scenario GARBAGE. And I hope that Collins goes with you.

B0017T4IG0|5.0|As with the majority of those here I have also been waiting for a proper DVD release of this great film. My appreciation for classical music began with this movie and I always looked forward to seeing it come on TV back in the day. For those still waiting like myself there is hope. The film is in production to be remade. I know, your immediate initial response is probably \\"Oh, no\\", but wait. There's a positive side to this. First off, Virgina Madsen herself is producing the picture with her new production company \\"Title IX Productions\\" along with her partner Karly Meola. Ok, fair enough. The star of the original is making the retelling happen. That could be promising. What's even better is that she hired the original screenwriter, Rusty Lemorande, to pen the new script. So, Virginia is involved AND the person that was responsible for the original story is back to help recreate it. That adds up to a possible slice of awesome coming our ways if it happens.<br /><br />Now, what does that mean for the original? It gives it a real chance at being recognized and receiving its due credit as a great film from the 80's (which are the new 50's by the way), and having a remake in theaters usually tends to help a once forgotten film finally hit the DVD and now Blu-Ray shelves. Let's keep our fingers crossed and show our support for the new film and allow it to bring the original into the limelight for a whole new generation to enjoy.<br /><br />\\"That's tellin' him, Howard!\\"
B003EV6DBM|5.0|Most of the negative reviewers are just sour grapes because David Tennant isn't involved anymore. Ignore them!  Matt Smith is fantastic as Doctor Who.  The stories are creative, fantastic, complex...and fun!  It also has emotional punch.  Doctor Who is going to change from time to time...get used to it!
B000EHQ57Q|5.0|This review is for the Quad mix, not the music which has been reviewed several thousand times over the past 40 years. Having owned the original Quad reel tape of QOB, I go way back with surround sound. And today's DTS and SACD DVD surround sound releases are better than the Quad tape and (Quadradisc, SQ or QS) LP releases of the 70's. As far as I remember, this is the original 4.0 mix from the 70's when the Moodies released most of their albums on quad reel tape (a 5.1 setup is fine too but don't expect music from the center or subwoofer on this or any other original 70's Quad re-release). And, compared to other surround mixes I've heard over the years, this one rocks. It was great then and even better now. You'll hear instruments and vocals in the rear channels completely discrete from the fronts, in fact sometimes you get just a lone vocal complete with breath noises you could never hear in a 2 channel mix. The SACD format really sparkles on the highs, very clean, not over-emphasized or distorted, there's no tape hiss to be heard, no dropouts and as I said the separation is awesome. Listening to this great band in Quad in this format really does them justice.
B002JCSWV6|1.0|Initially I didn't want to see this movie but I changed my mind because I thought hey it deserves a chance. But man how wrong I was. I should have stuck to my first instinct because this movie is boring. Morgan Freeman for as terrific an actor as he is I thought struggled with the role of Nelson Mandela. Sometimes he did the South African accent and other times he sounded like himself. The inconsistency in his accent was really annoying. And this movie just didn't wow me like previous Morgan Freeman movies such as Glory, The Shawnshank Redemption, and Amistad. Matt Damon though did a good job in his role as The South African rugby player but his performance is overshadowed by the sluggish pace and the fact that this movie is just flat-out boring. If you want to see an even better Matt Damon movie than this, then check out The Informant! It's a hidden comedic gem. As far as directing, I can't believe the guy who directed this movie is the same guy who starred in the masterpiece known as Gran Torino. Yes I am talking about the one and only Clint Eastwood who also happened to direct Gran Torino. I won't be hard on Clint though because Gran Torino is a hard act to follow but damn the movie that follows Gran Torino in his directing career shouldn't be as bad as this movie. To anyone reading this, I advise that you don't make the same mistake I did seeing this movie. It's not worth 2 hours and 15 minutes of your life to see this colossal dreck!
B000OV0370|4.0|It does say on the posting that this is from the first edition library, which I just didn't attend to when making the purchase and didn't realize until I received the book that it was in fact published much later than I had initially expected. I noticed that some of the postings are similarly priced to the book I purchased, but do not clearly indicate that the book is not an actual first edition so be mindful of that. If you want an actual first edition book, make sure that it does NOT specify \\"library\\" or inquire about the copyright date.<br /><br />Otherwise, this book is lovely; it's  beautiful reproduction of the first edition. And the story is a true classic.
0312370849|4.0|I could not put the book down!   I thought the author's format of short, alternating past/present scenarios throughout most of the book would be annoying, but it was quite the opposite... The story piqued my intent to research the historical setting about which I am, admittedly, ignorant.    My only disappointment is that, after such a compelling and dynamic narrative, I found the ending somewhat weak - though I can't say how I think it should've ended...    Nevertheless, a FANTASTIC read!
B003E48AYC|5.0|Our entire family loved this movie - great for big kids, little kids (with hands over eyes at a few points!), and for adults.  Johnny Depp is his always awesome self, and the rest of the casting is perfect, even if it takes a minute to get used to Ann Hathaway in her role.  Having a daughter, I love that Alice is the character who rides to the princess' rescue (as opposed to some handsome prince), AND that she takes a stand against what's expected of her.  Fabulous subtext for the adventure!
0307346617|5.0|To simply call \\"World War Z\\" a zombie novel is a disservice to the literature itself, to the writer and the readers. \\"World War Z\\" is so much more than a zombie novel. Yes, there is some gore, but not much, and the focus is much more upon the human element than that of the horror and the walking dead.<br /><br />Told as a series of recorded tales, \\"World War Z\\" is the story of not only a zombie apocalypse, but more importantly the human will to survive such. To this extent, this book has a much more positive outcome than do most other books in the genre.<br /><br />If only more modern fiction were nearly this good.
B002YMWPUA|5.0|I suggest reading Bobby Sands: Writings from Prison before watching to get the full impact of this heartbreaking movie.  This story was very well told, and the extras on the DVD are great too, not just the filler that most DVDs have.
B003IPC5SO|5.0|While perhaps not the most ambitious album of Kylie's career, [[ASIN:B003IPC5SO Aphrodite]] holds a distinction that precious few albums in the Minogue oeuvre share - sonic and thematic cohesion. The concept is quite simple, really. First, take an album of euphoric love songs, christen it [[ASIN:B003IPC5SO Aphrodite]] after the Greek goddess of love, and put Kylie on the cover in a celestial, flowing blue gown in a dramatic goddess stance as becoming the deity she embodies. Second, create a video for the lead single, [[ASIN:B003R3JORW All the Lovers]], featuring Kylie at the apex of a mountain of \\"lovers\\" that she will then orchestrate; manipulating her adoring masses into echoing her every gesture and movement. Bulls-eye, baby. I tip my hat to Ms. Minogue for recognizing the power of deciding on a theme and blessedly sticking with it. It really contributes to the overall \\"completeness\\" of the [[ASIN:B003IPC5SO Aphrodite]] experience. The songs themselves coexist in a perfectly produced microcosm of sonic euphoria (producer Stuart Price's forte), making [[ASIN:B003IPC5SO Aphrodite]] easily the most concise Minogue album since 2000's much under-recognized masterpiece, [[ASIN:B00004YAHB Light Years]], and her most aesthetically satisfying piece since 1997's [[ASIN:B000007WF4 Impossible Princess]].<br /><br />In short, [[ASIN:B003IPC5SO Aphrodite]] joins ranks in what can now be called the \\"Holy Trinity\\" of Kylie Minogue albums (along with the aforementioned two), and we should all be so lucky that Pop's Princess will continue to bless us with such fully-realized collections in the future.<br /><br />A joyous triumph.
B002ZRPQ5K|1.0|I loved Keanes first two records and consider Under the Iron Sea one of the best the best records of the decade. This record however is an incredible disappointment.     At their best Keane was brilliantly derivative molding identifiable influences into something unique and original. You could feel the musical inspiration but you didn't care, the songs were great and they felt honest. This record feels self conscious, the songs are bad and Toms once soaring vocals now feel clawing and lugubrious. I hope the guys don't think they're finding themselves with this effort. If they are it will be the last Keane record I buy.

B002VKE1K2|5.0|The Camcorder Horror genre doesn't bother me at all, which allows me to watch the movie without thinking of it as another Blair Witch knockoff. Paranormal Activity is by far probably my favorite horror movie of recent years. We have so many garbage remakes in the horror genre today, it is good to see a new story that is actually scary. The way the film just gradually builds is great. I didn't see this in theaters, but I was watching this at home and there were scenes that put me on edge. The darkness of the film and the sound effects really work. You hear a lot but can see little and that makes the imagination run wild. Then the things you do see only adds to it. I loved it and wanted to see it again when it was over. Overall, it is a great horror movie
B002ZG980U|3.0|I'd give it 3 1/2 stars.  This film is worth going to the theater to see.    ***  spoilers below    What bothered me initially about the film was that the dreams just didn't seem very dream-like.  Most of the dreams were way too detailed and clear, and seemed too strict in following the logical patterns the film set for them.  Most of the dreams lacked the surreal touches, the dreamy fuzziness as portrayed in other much simpler films like \\"Dreamscape\\".  Because of this I just couldn't completely buy-in-to the story, I never 'lost' my self in the story.  And I think for me this made some of the more complex details of how the logic behind dreams operated seem somewhat distracting and annoying... for example, Having to figure out why some of the characters seemed to easily leave the lower 'Purgatory' dream level and others apparently could not.    Also some important rules followed by the 'induced' dreams of the film appear to only apply to those types of dreams and not to natural dreams...  I know this may seem obvious but I think the film unnecessarily blurred the line between the 'nature' of the  induced and natural dreams leading to some confusion.     For example: If I have a 'natural' dream about having a dream, i.e. the so-called layered dreams (I've actually had dreams like this),  My brain won't operate at some hyperactive level causing me to have days, months or even years worth of experiences while only sleeping for hours (as the movie said could happen in their induced layered dreams).    Another thing I had a lot of trouble buying into was that the characters involved in multi-layered dreams left some sort of 'ethereal' bodies asleep at the lower dream levels (while they are experiencing an upper level).     They have one (Just one) 'real' body in the real world, that's all.     e.g. I could go along with the idea that the 'Chemist' might experience the others as being in a drug induced sleep while he's driving the van during that wild chase scene.   Butwhy would the others have any connection/dependency-on the Chemist's perception of their sleeping bodies at the lower dream level?   For example, If one of the character's faux asleep-body was shot in the head while in the van, why should this have any effect on them (once they've passed on to and are experiencing another dream level)?     In other words, when their minds move on to another dream level I see no logical reason why they would be leaving behind some bizarre dream-sleep body(ies) at the lower levels.  They might DREAM that they are waking up from one level to the next but to say that they actually leave behind some sort of sleeping dream-bodies seems silly to me.    --------------- ------------    Perhaps the single most dream-like scene of the film was when Cobb was trying to escape from some pursuers and he gets stuck in an alley-way which narrows to an extraordinary extent.  In a nightmare it isn't uncommon to have something inexplicably slow your progress while trying to escape from pursuers.    The problem with this scene is that Cobb wasn't in a dream when this happened...  or was he? ;-)    That's one aspect of the film I liked a lot, there seemed to be hints now and then that we are still actually watching a dream when the characters were supposedly awake...     Didn't the Cobb character say there was a danger in composing a dream too close to your real-life because you could no longer distinguish between the two?
B00000IMTF|5.0|1976 was the year that \\"Rising\\" was released.  I was too young to know anything about Rainbow at the time...I was only 3 years old.  I heard this album for the first time when I was older during the mid-80's.  I remember I was at a friend's house looking through old albums he had and I saw this one mixed in with his Dio albums.  I asked him what it was because it was the first time I had seen this record.  I am a huge Ronnie James Dio fan so I really wanted to hear it.  Needless to say, I ran out as soon as I could to find the tape.  If you are into Dio then this is a must-have.  Ronnie James has always seemed to have the luck of working with some of the best guitar players in the business and Ritchie Blackmore is no slouch.  Probably more known for being in Deep Purple, Ritchie is a wizard at playing the electric gutar.  Especially whilst he was in his band, Rainbow.  I'm not too familiar with Deep Purple other than the hits.  However, I know a bit about Rainbow.  They had a more classical and melodic sound I think.  \\"Rising\\" is a short album but it has some really great metal songs on it.  \\"Tarot Woman\\" opens the album with a keyboard intro by Tony Carei which is a prelude to the awesome mix job by none other than Martin Birch who is best known for his work with Iron Maiden.  A powerful tune in which Dio and the rest of the band take you to a bright shining place.    \\"Run With the Wolf\\" is a solid rocker that keeps the feel and is a typical formula of Rainbow.  \\"Starstruck\\" was written about a woman who always followed Ritchie around and it a great song with a great solo.  \\"Do You Close Your Eyes\\" is kind of weird.  Doesn't fit the album too well but it's ok.  But, Now, we come to \\"Stargazer\\".  Possibly one of the best metal epics ever written!  Cozy Powell open this classic with a great drum intro while Ritchie slides in with one of the greatest guitar riffs of all time.  Jimmy Bain, the bass player who would later play in Dio's solo band and also known for his group, Wild Horses, is a tight player who keeps it in the pocket and plays just the right thing.  Tony Carei plays along with his soaring keyboards that mix very well with the guitar and Ronnie tells us the tale of slaves who try to build a tower to the stars.  Truly, \\"Stargazer\\" is just as much a classic as \\"War Pigs\\", \\"Smoke on the Water\\", and \\"Rock and Roll All Nite\\".  Then, the record closes with \\"A Light in the Black\\".  This track really showcases the talent of each of the great members of Rainbow at the time.  Again, this is another metal epic.  One of the greatest harmonies ever played during the middle of this song with a scathing guitar solo to boot.  \\"Rising\\" turns out to be a very solid album with a lot of strong tunes on it depite it's short length.  A definite metal must have!  This album sounds like it was recorded around 1982 or maybe around 1984 but was made in 1976.  It has a 70's sound, but it really comes across very heavy.  Ritchie's distortion is at a great level and Martin Birch mixes everything very well.  The drums have a huge sound.  Sounds like they were recorded in a cathedral.  Don't let all the talk about syths scare you.  The keyboards on this album are'nt like the keyboards of the 80's.  Rainbow's second album beloongs in every Dio fan's collection.  Not only that, is is an essential album to have in any serious heavy metal collector's CD rack.
B0001GMIOE|4.0|Seems to be original Canon battery.  As such, it is somewhat expensive.  I can't help but wonder if an aftermarket battery would do the job?
B002T9H2LA|2.0|I think my biggest gripe with this film was the fact that, based on the title, I fully expected it to primarily follow the exploits of the Basterds.  However, quite honestly they could have been left completely out of the film with very little effort--they were nothing more than background characters popping in every now and again.  Pitt's character had so much potential to be interesting, but we never learn hardly anything about him and he quickly becomes rather generic.  Similarly, the plot itself had quite a bit of potential to be intriguing and enthralling, but instead became labored and boring.  I'm glad I waited for the DVD rental, rather than wasting money on the big screen.
B002ZG980U|5.0|This movie works in more ways than I can even think to name. Start with the start power: Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead role, Ellen Page playing the most mature part I've seen so far, an under-used Michael Caine, Ken Watanabe, and more.<br /><br />The action plays out in the dreams of the heir to an industrial empire. The goal: to get him to shut it down. Despite the obvious risk of degenerating into psychobabble, this stays true to its action theme, even when levels of reality start to layer like pastrami on rye. The victim, it turns out, has unexpected defenses. The attacker, it turns out, has unexpected weaknesses. And Page's character, Ariadne, takes on the role of her mythic namesake in unwinding the labyrinths of architecture and mind - not that this movie makes clear distinction.<br /><br />This could have become an effects-flick, as shown in Ariadne's intro to the dreamworld - possibly the most dramatic urban dreamscape since [[ASIN:0780622553 Dark City]]. That setpiece really just served to show the effectmeister's general restraint, except on the few scenes where the enhancement really mattered. Instead, the movie relies on plot, action, and acting - a refreshing change from so many summer films of recent years.<br /><br />The multi-reality backdrop worked well, on the whole, but might become clearer on a second viewing. No matter. \\"Inception\\" works well as a summer popcorn movie, but works well at other levels too. For once, it's a summer movie I'll remember even when summer is gone.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B002ZG980U|1.0|[[ASIN:1608870154 Inception]] reminded me of the old joke that \\"Reality is for those who can't deal with drugs.\\"  [[ASIN:1608870154 Inception]] is an absolute lovefest, celebrating altered states of consciousness and utter confusion.  As one overly long special effect, it is visually entertaining.  As a story, [[ASIN:1608870154 Inception]] is vastly inferior to Christopher Nolan's [[ASIN:B00003CXZ4 Memento]] and vastly inferior to Leonardo DeCaprio's [[ASIN:B001GCUO5M Shutter Island]].
030745455X|4.0|Stieg Larsson's second book in the best-selling triology doesn't disappoint. The inscrutable Lisbeth Salander is back in full force, again having to deal with evil characters emerging from her past, and always coming up on top, somehow. Larsson again demonstrates his ability to weave a complicated plot that pulls the reader right in. Now we have to try the last one in the series of course! Can she reconcile with Blomqvist, for heaven's sake, in the course of her last adventure?!!
6305882592|5.0|Harold is a young rich kid who finds that the only thing in life that brings him joy is death - namely faking his and attending funerals for those who have recently experienced their own (never mind that he doesn't know the recently departed).  Maude is a much much older lady who finds that the only thing in life that brings her joy is everything, especially the things she shouldn't do - like attending funerals of strangers and then stealing cars of mourners to get herself home.  The two of course meet up and an unlikely wild ride ensues.<br /><br />If I'm not mistaken this was filmed in '71 and released in '72?  I was born around then so I missed this one until now when it came up in a \\"If you like these movies, you may like this one\\" search.  It was so good that I realized I may need to start catching up on some others I missed that were \\"before my time\\".  If you like quirky, character driven stories, this is a good one to go with so long as some darker themes don't offend you.

Before reading this I had read, \\"Why evolution is true\\" which is outstanding in its own right and very informative also.<br /><br />Dawkins is very eloquent and just seems to be gifted in his ability to articulate seemingly difficult subject matter and make it very interesting and exciting to read. He reminds me of Carl Sagan in his ability to elucidate. Every page I found myself reading twice because I found it that interesting.<br /><br />Being a layman, the most difficult chapter for me was the various dating methods used to date rocks and fossils. I understood it, but it just wasn't as interesting as the other chapters. Though I understand why it was necessary to include this. You simply cannot deny the vast amount of evidence of evolution from all the various scientific disciplines. Also, getting the facts straight helps see through the myriad of lies and misrepresentaion from the creationists and the so-called intelligent design crowd.<br /><br />I am sure this will be a book I will read a few more times in my life

It is interesting how nationally historic events can sometimes be swept under the carpet in order to save face.  I liked that there was little insight into Sarah's life after the war because it showed how her psyche had been destroyed.  Julia could have been a little more developed although I could see a correlation between her and Sarah.  Parts of the story brought tears to my eyes.  In the end, I had to remind myself that this was FICTION based on an actual event.
B00164GDD2|5.0|This is very worthy of a purchase. Even if you already have Ghostbusters for DVD. Regift it and get this version. So many extras, it is loaded with everything. Old and new interviews. A complete piece on the remodeling of Ecto-1, commentaries, Slimer mode, even a branching mode that details the entire process automatically. This disc has everything a Ghostbuster fan would ever want in extra content. The best version in my opinion. Loved it when the movie first came out, and still love it till this day. This is a must have for any movie enthusiast or collector.

B00009ZYC1|5.0|\\"Shrek\\" has made a name for itself in American pop culture as well as obtaining a place in cinematic history as being the first film to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Movie. Few of us will ever forget the original characters voiced by the likes of Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Mike Myers, and John Lithgow. Shrek is a giant orgre who attempts to resue his Princess from evil clutches, while at the same time trying to regain his rights to his swamp from the Lord Farquaad.<br /> The plot was written mainly for children, but adults will love it as there are many adult-orriented jokes throughout the picture.<br /> The movie went on to be one of the most successful animated movies of all-time grossing over $480,000,000 on a $60,000,000 budget while spawning several sequels over the years.<br /> The DVD is filled to the brim with extras including an alternate ending, behind-the-scenes featurette, commentary, and much more.<br /> \\"Newsweek\\" calls \\"Shrek \\"smart and hilarious\\".
0441013597|5.0|The book Dune is a wonderful Sci-Fi Novel. Many parts I felt like I could not read fast enough, because I had to know what would happen next.    I loved reading this book! It had a few moments that were boring, but they led up to something really good. When the book gets to a boring part, just read through it as fast as you can and soon it will get interesting again.    The first thing that I think this book does for you is makes you feel grateful for water. Dune is a desert planet and has no water or precipitation on it. You read about how the people of Dune, especially the Fremen, conserve water. In one point of the book, it says, \\"he saw human figures moving into the flower fields, sweeping them with strange scythe-like devices--dew gatherers. Water so precious here that dew must be collected.\\" Conserving water is one of the things that makes the book interesting. For example, the people of Dune wear Stillsuits to conserve their body's water. The only water they lose is through their hands.    In the back of the book there are appendices to help you understand the space travel, the environment of Dune, and the Bene Gesserit ways. I would read these before starting the book. There is also a small dictionary for words that you may not understand. The author, Frank Herbert, makes up new words for this book. As you read in the book if you don't understand what a word means look it up or soon the book will not make sense.      There is a movie to this book, and I watched it many times as a child. I don't know whether or not to have you watch it before reading the book. Watching the movie gives you a feel for the new \\"universe\\" that Frank Herbert has created. Watching it first will give away a lot of the book though. So I think it is a personal choice.    I really enjoyed this book. It creates a world that is unlike ours. It also is fun to read about something that is not in our lives. I really enjoyed the different things such as the space guild, Bene Gesserit ways, the Fremen, and the other things that Frank Herbert created.
006145205X|5.0|In a nutshell, Ridley argues that (1) humankind's progress depends on communication and resulting specialization and we're doing both things exponentially better and faster than ever; (2) disaster would befall humankind if every other factor (resource depletion, global climate change, population growth) were held steady, but those other factors never are; (3) pessimism enjoys intellectual supremacy in the West but undeservedly so; (4) everything will get better but people will still complain.<br /><br />People might disagree, but Ridley supports his sometimes counterintuitive assertions with a wall of references that is going to be hard to breach.<br /><br />This is a monumental work whose sometimes colloquial tone shouldn't disguise its immense scholarship.  Just one example: it's going to be harder for Jared Diamond to persuade a critical audience henceforth, although there will always be true believers aplenty.<br /><br />Increasingly, I believe that if we're going to insist on slotting people into categories, ones like \\"liberal\\" and \\"conservative\\" aren't analytically helpful. Much better to sort people by those who fear change and want to throttle it and those who welcome it and work to make it work. For example, environmentalists are routinely tagged as \\"liberal\\" when many among them are reactionary people, opposed to new power sources, infrastructure development, and even (my pet peeve as an avid mountain biker) bicycles on public trails. I think this idea runs through \\"The Rational Optimist.\\"<br /><br />I wish a foundation would buy and mail a copy of \\"The Rational Optimist\\" to every college undergraduate--or at least every environmental studies major.<br /><br />If I met Ridley, I would ask him these two questions (not as a challenge but out of curiosity):  why are the IBM Selectric II and the Hermes 3000 manual typewriter no longer produced? These were, respectively, the best electric and manual portable typewriters ever made. You could still use them to type envelopes and fill out forms. I'm sure he would have a thoughtful answer.<br /><br />There are a few flaws, none serious. As a Portuguese to English translator, I continue to complain when authors misspell \\"São Paulo\\" as \\"São Paolo.\\" A mere quibble, and it's spelled right in the index.<br /><br />I'd like to see a review of \\"The Rational Optimist\\" in the Sierra Club's magazine. If fairly reviewed, I think it would make tough going for the readership.<br /><br />Although Ridley has rid me of much of my own pessimism, I remain pessimistic in one respect. The thesis of this book will have to be articulated again and again and again because the prevailing intellectual ethos is, as he observes, so inclined toward a gloomy and dour view of humankind's prospects.<br /><br />One final note: those who liked \\"The Rational Optimist\\" should consider buying Bryan Caplan's \\"The Myth of the Rational Voter.\\" More counterintuitive food for the brain.re he would have a thoughtful answer.

B003A97PV0|4.0|I stumbled upon Biffy Clyro entirely by chance thanks to their song playing in the trailer for Charlie St. Cloud.  After a little searching, I came upon this album.  Only Revolutions is chock full of big hooks and clever lyrics, with song like 'Many of Horror' and 'The Captain' leading the way.  However, I think it was put together a bit slap dash and there are tracks that just don't seem to belong.  The pacing of the album is a bit thrown off, as can be seen in between 'Mountains' and 'Many of Horror'.  Two great songs with huge emotion end up sandwiching the terrible and out of place 'Shock Shock'.  The album has some incredible and honest music, but it feels like they might have missed out on an even better, cohesive experience.
B003J27WFW|5.0|Growing up in the era where MTV wasn't thought of and journalism wasn't on the internet, I grew up wondering what my favorite musicians would say, should they ever be interviewed.  Course, we had magazines but I think the lack of the journalism we have now, added to the mystic and the artist was left alone.  Still, it made me wonder.<br /><br />I was a rabid fan during the mid and late 70's to the mid 80's, and then after that, I didn't follow the band too closely.  However, Rush did introduce me to a lot of 70's prog-rock and yes, I DO enjoy the changing time signatures, clever lyrics and the music that appears to be too hard to play.  Today, we want our french fries hot and we want them NOW.  This video shows that sometimes patience and hard work does pay off and I would rather listen to music that is interesting and challenging, instead of what we're calling 'music' today.  Yes, I am a musician and I learned to play from studying my instrument and grew up listening to groups such as Rush, Deep Purple, Van Halen, Rainbow and the like.  Today, I listen to a lot of instrumentals simply because I am sick of today's bands showing us how much they can complain and bitch and load their songs with nothing but profanity and stupidity.  Watching this video gave me a much deeper respect for the band and it does show us musicians who are still fighting the corporate bullocks and those who say \\"you have to do THIS and sound like THEM\\".  If you stick to your guns and your heart, you can overcome the obstacles and find others who feel the same way.<br /><br />That's why I highly recommend this video to anyone who in need of a little tarting up.  Rush did it and is STILL doing it their way and it shows us that yes, even intelligent geeks can turn up and rock hard.<br /><br />The sound is great, the filming is great and it is entertaining, as well as, informative.  I would recommend this video to any musician and/or music fan.  It is a great insight to the world known as RUSH.

1416583408|3.0|I was so excited to get this book from the library after hearing the NPR interview with Alexandra Horowitz. I soon realized that it wasn't at all what I had expected. The book was written like a dissertation and was very dry and difficult to read. To me, for the most part, it is basically the authors interpretation of scientific research studies in order to gain a better understanding of the dog. Most of the book is her opinion. I know Ms. Horowitz is very qualified, but I try not to give too much weight to people's opinions, especially when they advertise them as fact. Although some things can be tested regarding the physiology and biology of the dog, no one can possibly be sure of what dogs are capable of knowing and feeling. It seems fruitless to attempt to generalize the mind and emotions of the dog when they are as individualistic as people. I too found it to be inconsistent in a lot of ways. On a positive note, I did enjoy the parts of the book that were fact based and touched on how the dog sees, smells, and hears. I did take away a better understanding of my dog. I try to anamorphize her less and see her as an animal living in my world. I try to take my time and let her take longer smell walks.

B00005JLPK|4.0|A true cinematic experience, I must say. The film emphasizes decently on Mrs Kahlo's life, throws immense light on her persona and outlook, and we, the audience witness what Frida the woman was all about and Salma Hayek successfully delivers a performance that gives us much more than just satisfaction. Alfred Molina gives his most probable best performance as 'Diego', such a flamboyant actor indeed who shows up having a great chemistry with Hayek on screen which almost glues your attention. A remarkable performance from almost everyone in the film. Witness Frida Kahlo, explore the seductive and mysterious lady, explore the artist in her, explore her heart and soul, you won't be disapointed.

1594202249|4.0|I am probably one of the few people on this planet who can claim to have read all of Pynchon's novels, with the exception of Against the Day (which I still have three hundred pages to go), and I've perused Gravity's Rainbow four times over a twenty year period.  I can therefore say with some authority that this is definitely his most accessible novel.  The plot is pretty much linear and straightforward, and outside of a brief jaunt to Las Vegas, all the action takes place in the span of a few weeks in a beachtown and other parts of the LA area, as opposed to his other novels where the action unfolds over months, years, even centuries in various and sundry regions around the globe from the vantage points of numerous characters.  This novel is also unique in the Pynchon oeuvre in that it is told from the viewpoint of only one character, the \\"gum-sandal\\" hippy detective Doc Sportello.  Pynchon affords us a deep look into the mind of this singular character, who bears some resemblance to previous happy-go-lucky types in Pynchonland, from Tyrone Slothrop, with whom he shares a central mystery and a lot of detective work coupled with a string of casual love encounters, to Zoyd Wheeler, one of the main characters in Vineland who could even be a more jaded, older version of Doc.  In the process of solving the mystery of the disappearance of a bigwig developer and his own ex-girlfriend, Doc works his way through a viper's nest of odd and sometimes menacing characters, proving himself not only a lot smarter than he seems on the surface, and a badass not to be messed with, but also a man of great compassion for the folks under his watchful eye.  One of the most enchanting aspects of this novel is how well Pynchon captures a sense of time and place.  His detailed descriptions of car rides through the LA area, songs on the radio, eateries and other establishments, homes and institutions have the ring of authenticity, and Pynchon must have done some prodigious research into the local history and culture of late '60s LA.  Or perhaps he was there at the time and has a fantastic memory for details.  Either way, Pynchon's latest novel is a refreshing break from the mindnumbingly epic scope of his previous one, but it resonates with many of the themes that Pynchon has developed throughout his career as a novelist, particularly the struggle of \\"little people\\" to survive and understand the bare workings of the monstrous institutions of authority and power that shape and channel their lives.ocal history and culture of late '60s LA.

If you liked Planet Earth, you will equally enjoy this series.
B0036TGSR6|5.0|Despite his personal life, I've always loved Roman Polanski's thrillers. I'll admit he's not always on the mark with movies but when he is he strikes gold. The Ghost writer, based on Robert Harris' novel (who also wrote the screenplay) is one of the best thrillers to come around in a long time.<br /><br />The plot of Ghost Writer involes a nameless writer (an excellent McGregor) who's been hired to spend a month with a Tony Blair-ish former prime minister (perfectly cast Pierce Brosnan) and ghost-write his memoirs, replacing another biographer who died under mysterious circmstances. As our protagonist interviews the prime minister and his wife he ends up getting involved (in more ways than one) with them and uncovers political secrets, lies and cover-ups that threaten his own life. Like the novel the plot of the film sometimes flirts with the predictable, but it's always engaging and even manages to catch you off-guard with some surprising humor and insight into the creative writing process.<br /><br />The cast in this film is both terrific and unexpected. It's been a while since Ewan McGregor and Pierce Brosnan have done a film worthy of note and they've never been better than in the Ghost Writer. Kim Cattral is surprisingly good (and surprisingly well-cast) as the Prime Minister's assistant. Olivia Williams is absolutely brilliant as the Prime Minister's long suffering wife. The rest of the cast is well chosen with Tom Wilkinson, Timothy Hutton and Eli Wallach. Even James Belushi is given a small but memorable role.<br /><br />The Ghost Writer is also well filmed taking place mostly on an isolated estate. The sense of being shut off from the rest of the world is perfectly realized and the atmosphere really draws you into the story.<br /><br />While the Ghost Writer may not be up there with Roman Polanski's classics like 'Knife in the Water', 'Chinatown' and 'Repulsion' it is one of the best films I've seen in this disappointing year and an easy must-see experience.

But I do, I do, I do feel bad.<br />Nothing like a truly crappy book to spoil a nice Summer afternoon.<br />A Harlequin could have been more entertaining maybe?<br />I won't even pass this one on - it's going into the trash heap, where it belongs.

0061120081|5.0|I had put off writing this review for a long time because, really, what can one say about this memorable, widely popular coming-of-age story except that there is a good reason To Kill a Mockingbird was voted one of the best novels of the twentieth century by librarians across the U.S.<br /><br />For you contrarians who haven't read the book, this is the story of the Finch family told from daughter Scout's point of view. Scout's attorney father, Atticus, is defending a black man accused of raping a young white woman in the small town of Maycomb, Alabama. The story is set years before the civil rights movement began, and the plot is a catalyst for a novel that is so much more than a scathing commentary on racism in the deep south. This is a gripping, gritty portrayal about growing up amidst the fury, ignorance, intolerance, and fear that fueled peoples' lives and thoughts, and still does, to varying degrees.<br /><br />Like many people, I first read this novel through our school's curriculum about forty years ago. Five years ago, my daughter read it in her high school English class and she loved it too. This novel is timeless, not only for the poignant, beautiful language and heartbreaking conflict, but for the relevancy of its message. I've read a lot of novels in my time, but I still remember this one clearly--many people do--for good reason.

As soon as I saw the Star Wars edition today, I bought it on the spot at a local bookstore. After I signed my slip I realized I was so blown away by the product I forgot to check the price before I bought it.     Like all Scanimation books, the pictures are small in scope but big on animation. the animation is provided by alternating bands of tint, a very cool effect. Even the presence of several (3 or 4) scenes from the most recent three movies did not detract significantly from my enjoyment.     An excellent book for any fan of any of the three movies, or pop-up/childrens book collectors.

B002VPE1AW|3.0|I wouldn't say it sucked, but it is definitely over-rated.    While obviously the graphics are nice, and much of the art direction was at least interesting, the story itself was so average as to be laughable.    There are so many little \\"are you kidding me?\\" moments that it's kind of pathetic... for example: When you name your \\"unobtainable\\" metal \\"unobtanium\\" you show no respect for your viewing audience. That's the kind of gimmick name that could have been used as a \\"nickname\\" for the metal, but should have been laughed out of the writers room as a serious suggestion.    Or let's see... he meets the very first alien... well of course its the princess of the tribe.. and of course they are forced to work together and of course they fall in love... I think anyone over the age of 12 has seen this story at least a dozen times.    Now don't get me wrong, I don't regret watching it, it was nice to see once and eat some popcorn, but it's a fluff movie that doesn't deserve tons of repeat viewing or anywhere near the praise it's been getting. I have 1000 DVD's on my movie wall, most of them are at least as good or better than this run of the mill sci fi knock off.    The fans of this movie are named well, they proudly call themselves \\"avatards\\" and yea, you pretty much have to be a 'tard to consider this film more than average.     And one more warning: They are milking the DVD releases for everything they can get, there's going to be at least 3 versions out in the coming year (bare bones theatrical, special extended edition, ultimate edition with extras....) and that's just the 3 I know of (oh and plus the blue ray, etc versions). So if you do bother buying the movie, be VERY careful you know which version you want or you will end up not only investing in an average movie, but you'll end up buying it multiple times just to get everything that should have been included in the first release.    For me, I'll buy it used out of the $2.99 bin at my local block buster, because that's all it's worth to me.

A dark gangster film with the usual twist thrown in at the end. Its very hard to follow all the character's plots and how they relate to each other. But I enjoy movies that make you think.

006621131X|5.0|I picked up Patti Smith's autobiography/biography 3 days ago and couldn't put it down. There are so many facets of the book that make it memorable, but the most electric quality is Patti's poetic, clear and honest voice.  She mentions in the book that she never liked glitter and this comes through in her prose. She glorifies nothing and is direct and true, even when it makes her look less than glamorous. It is eye-opening to see her young self landing in New York without money or education and forming an amazing life and career with nothing but her belief in herself and in art. On the way, she gathers many friends and mentors, rubs shoulders with literary and rock icons, and works hard to pay the bills. I found her to be uncomplaining and uncompromising in describing her early years of poverty, hunger, joblessness, and nights on the street. It's clear that every experience was part of her education and that she rose above the ranks of many around her because of her singular vision, intelligence, and artistry.<br />Sometimes her descriptions of her young life are raw (she describes herself as crude) and difficult to take. The dark side of Robert Mapplethorpe, which Patti herself attests to not understanding, is especially gritty and unfathomable. It is Patti's nature to accept everyone as they are and see beyond the parts she doesn't understand, and somehow she gets the reader to do that too.<br />Her exchanges with Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix are so much fun to read. Her young romance with the playwright, Sam Shepard, is told with her usual unvarnished, straight-shooting style. Ultimately, Patti is a survivor. She is endlessly flexible, a trick she learned from Mapplethorpe. She forgives the universe its foibles (she has lived through a lot of tragedy) and also forgives herself. I learned something from Patti.<br />After you read the book, watch her perform on youtube - she's riveting.

1453605738|3.0|Jane Austen is known to be one of the greatest classic female novelists. Her stories contain strong heroines, who rebel against societal norms in order to achieve their full potential as women. Pride and Prejudice, Austen's most well-known work, does not fail to contain this familiar element of Austen's writings.<br /><br />The novel follows the story of the Bennet sisters, primarily the two eldest, Jane and Elizabeth, and their misadventures in love. Jane is the sweet-tempered, docile, and beautiful daughter, making her Mrs. Bennet's favorite. On the other hand, Elizabeth is independent, hot-headed and sarcastic, making her Mr. Bennet's favorite. Mrs. Bennet's main focus in life is to have her five daughters married to wealthy men so Mrs. Bennet can live a life in comfort.<br /><br />When wealthy Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy move in to Netherfield, the estate next to that of Mr. Bennet, Mrs. Bennet is elated at the possibility of at least one of her daughters marrying one of the men. Mr. Bingley is almost instantly taken with the innocent Jane, while Mr. Darcy manages to insult Elizabeth within moments of meeting her. This starts the rocky relationship between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. Blinded by pride and prejudice, both parties must face hurt and heartbreak before finally receiving their happily ever after.<br /><br />Despite strong characterization, especially of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, Pride and Prejudice does not make my list of favorite books. The story is flat, with no interesting plot elements outside of the occasional use of verbal irony for some humor. As it is a romantic comedy, it is predictable and lacks the depth of most great classic novelists such as Dumas, Dickens, and Leroux.<br /><br />Pride and Prejudice is a light-hearted easy-read. However, if looking for a book that is engaging, it might be best to look elsewhere.

030726999X|5.0|The books were written by Stieg Larsson, who died at 50 from a massive heart-attack.  If you are a fan of the books, you most likely read about Mr. Larsson desire to write nine books about these character we have come to love (or at least that is what people close to him have said).  The women who he was living with has an unifinished manuscript for a fourth book and a couple of outlines for future books.  What I am hinting at is my fear going into the third book.<br /><br />If you read the second book, then you know Mr. Larsson left us with at a bit of a cliff-hanger.  Many story lines were left unsolved and most fans in the US like myself, couldn't wait for the next book to come out.  As I stated above about his desire to write more books, I was afraid the third would end with a ton of loose ends that would never get answered.  Luckily for us, this is not the case.  I will not go into what the book is about since if you read the second, you have an idea what will happen in this book.  I will say I enjoyed the third and hopefully final book.  I felt very content on how the books ended.  There were a couple of interesting questions left, but nothing that made me depressed about knowing that they would never get answered.<br /><br />It is sad to know that Mr. Larsson will never comprehend what wonderful books he has written and how the world cherished the novels he wrote.  All there is left to say; bravo Mr. Larsson.
B000002VQQ|5.0|If you like good writing mixed with recent history of rock and roll, punk and the NY City art scene get this book. Patti Smith has a liquid, effortless way with words that moves you, and paints a portrait of her eternal friendship with Robert Mapplethorpe. Just Kids illustrates why Patti Smith is the punk icon that she is, her unjudgemental love for Robert Mapplethorpe transcends his sexual awakening and moves beyond mortal love to something beyond the carnal.

A huge amount of pictures and text on how to tie knots. An expensive book but it's a very useful book. I'd say it's the bible of all knots. A sailors, climbers, or just a recreational persons bible on how to tie knots.

1933784032|4.0|As a model maker I love my reference sources, and I bought this book with the aim of producing two FineMolds 1/48 X-wings in a death star diorama. For that end the book was only moderately useful as there are only limited shots of each model. Each models gets roughly 1-2 pages, or perhaps a large fold out spreed for more important items - the Falcon and snowspeeder etc. However as a coffee table book it is excellent. The pictures are large and clear, and furthermore the shots are actually visually interesting, so much so that everyone who visits inevitably thumbs through this book with great interest - star wars fan or not. Also there is a surpising amount of writing in the book and the various anec dotes are well done and worth a read. My summation would be to say that is a visually interesting book particulary for model makers like myself that is useful for stimulating ideas, or as a general coffee table book. However if you want extensive reasearch materials or modelling tips then the internet might still be your best source.

B003W9I9JU|5.0|So after talking with Amazon about the static problem, I was given credit towards more video on demand, and the problem was fixed in less than 12 hours.  This episode is the best one yet of the series, and I can't wait to watch it on my Television.    Edit - I just want to point out that the version that I watched was the one that I downloaded, not the one that streams off the web.  It looks like Amazon has taken the ability to stream the video offline for the moment.  I will have to wait to watch it on the big screen.
B001HPP2X2|5.0|I will admit to some hesitation at even wanting to watch this show.<br /><br />I sit in Dialysis 2.5 hours a day 5 days a week. Sitting in Dialysis is hard, the recliner chairs are most uncomfortable having two 15 gage needles stuck in your arm is at best painful. Nor having anyone to talk to is the pits.<br /><br />what i did is bought (what was at the time) the only portable blu ray player on the market and started watching blu ray movies.<br /><br />i was told about Dexter by friends and everyone that told me about it loved t. \\"it's about a cop that kills on the side\\" they would tell me. after a few of them talked me sensless about it i thought i would try it.<br /><br />I loved it from the first show.<br /><br />Set in Miami, Dexter works for the police department figuring out how blood splatters from the victems of knife or gun shot wounds. but he has a darker side. he himself is a killer. his step father taught him how to channel his instincts and kill thoughs that are \\"unworthy to live\\".<br /><br />It;s dark, often funny, and very bloody. this is not recomended for those that can' stand people screaming and bleeding a lot. but it is for those that have a dark sense of humor
9889979942|5.0|I met Tom when he was looking for someone to teach him how to use his new DSLR camera.  I went to meet him and teach the workings of the camera he just purchased.  When I saw his photos, I thought to myself that this guy didn't really need any instruction, but then I found out he made those images with his point and shoot camera.  I was blown away.  His ability to capture great images was already in place and I knew that he would get even better images with his new equipment.  This new book proves what I already knew.  I am never less than impressed with his images and his ability to capture the heart and soul of the people he takes photos of. This book is not to be missed and I am glad to know Tom and call him a friend.
B003KUSUG8|4.0|I only gave it a four because a person can always do better.  Fans were sick of the Arab voice, and Em listened.  The reason Em is a good lyricist is because he takes his time. There is not one song on the ablum were you don not want to rewind and listen to what he just said. Of course there are a few songs, like WTP, that you do not really enjoy.  Hip Hop is falling off.  Drake just came out with a new album and it's all hype.  People say:  \\"Why do you rap about your kids, mom, drugs, habits, etc.?\\"  That's what makes him good at what he does.

B001QOGYBI|4.0|\\"Fantastic Mr. Fox\\" really is a smart and witty, fun and entertaining family movie written by two of our most intellectual film-makers (Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach), adapted from the Roald Dahl classic.    When Mr. Fox sees the dangers in raiding farmers' livestock (his curiosity causes him to trap him and his pregnant wife) he becomes a newspaper columnist, only to eventually realize that raiding farmers' homes is a far more nobler calling (as a former journalist, I agree completely with his assessment).  His raiding angers the farmers, who begin a massive foxhunt, forcing him and his fellow animals deep underground, then into the sewage system, and then finally into the worst place of them all -- a modern supermarket.     George Clooney does a terrific job of voicing Mr. Fox, and if I had not learned that Meryl Streep was in the movie I would have thought the casting perfect.

1441407820|1.0|I was hoping at the end of the book that when Siddhartha met Gotama, instead of Govinda, once again and addressed him, \\"O Illustrious One...,\\" he would be answered back by, \\"O Worthless One...how have you wasted your life...and my time!\\" Then, Gotama will walk on for the rest of his life without a care in the world. That would be sublime enough and practically enough to say that the book Siddhartha is a rubbish piece of literature. It is 152 pages of ostentatiousness, and it is 152 pages of farting moments. I thought everybody involved in the book wasted their lives trying to find the meaning of life, and I felt my time wasted when everybody was trying to teach each other the lesson of life. Notice that Siddhartha can't be a good son to his father by never seeing him again the rest of his life. Notice that he can't be a good husband to a woman who could have taken somebody else wealthier than him. Notice that he abandoned his son before he was born and does nothing about it after the fact (trust me, he will know through rumors; the river then again does \\"talk\\"). Notice how he failed to be a father to his son. Meanwhile, the three great, albeit WORTHLESS, qualities of Siddhartha possesses are: wait, think, and fast. Oh...wow....I am seeing stars. Another thing I hate is how monks and the similar kinds would go from town to town, begging for food and receiving it without reservations. Oh man! Get a job and then buy your own food! Or make/hunt your own food, you lazy, selfish bums! The Worthless One has found the meaning of his life because he wined, gambled, whored, and ate his way for the better part of his life and is satisfied with the idea that he has reached the absolutism of his life and has, in a way, been thought of as a \\"holy man.\\" *yawn*...so much for manipulation. How the protagonist did it was rather superficial to me. Siddhartha...what a silly book! It should have been aptly re-titled Selfishartha.

B003ODL004|4.0|Great music. Loved it in the movie. Disc seems a bit short, wish there were more.
B002UJIY7A|2.0|Movie really moves along like the pace of a slow turtle, the acting is pretty cardboard like a TV lifetime movie. I really like Steve Zahn but even he doesnt bring any comic relief to the film, its not necessarily predictable but also you sense whats coming. Making the killers obvious wasn't really something that worked effectively being that they weren't the killers if that makes sense. The whole movie is basically just a meshed together semi-thriller that goes no where but down. On another note, the couple in the movie wed being Newly Weds and traveling the so called trails is very inaccurate, mainly because you don't go on dangerous trails with 1000 drop offs with out a guide or gear. The fact that all the couples in the movie are going the same direction and making camps right near the stormy ocean line isn't very convincing either. There are no rangers, no guides, no signs and really no point to anywhere they are heading. So the killers from the BIG ISLAND as you would call it, end up on the smallest one, by chance? Maybe, maybe not. But when you start to get into the meat and potatoes of the film you really don't even care. Poor dialogue, cheesy screenplay and a really horrible story line make you want to getaway, from this movie that is. What a wreck. 2 stars for the beauty of Hawaii!

0399156577|4.0|For me, Nora Roberts almost never fails to deliver an enjoyable, readable book. This one was no different. I liked \\"The Search\\" a lot...I probably wouldn't qualify it as one of my favorites by her, but I can see myself reading it again in a year or two.    Series Note:  No series connections.    Summary:  Years ago, Fiona Bristow had the perfect life in the works...a great fiance, an upcoming wedding, a loving family. Then it all fell apart when she unintentionally caught the eye of the Red Scarf Killer. When all was said and done, she was the only survivor of RSK, her fiance and his police K-9 partner were dead, and her life was in shambles. To help recover from the terrifying, grief-inducing ordeal, Fiona moves to Orcas Island and in honor of her late fiance starts a canine obedience and search and rescue training school. Since then, she's managed to find peace and be content with her life.    Then things change yet again. First, she learns that there is a copycat killer out there imitated RSK and who may have her in his sights. Then Simon Doyle drives up her lane, desperately needing help training his rambunctious puppy, Jaws. Fiona is drawn to surly but kind Simon and what starts as a hot affair leads to more. But RSK2 is on her heels, constantly reminding her that a killer wants her dead.    Review:  If you've read any of NRs recent books, this one is much in the same vein. NR picks a topic - like house restoration in \\"Tribute\\" and animal conservation/rescue in \\"Black Hills\\" - and fully immerses the readers in it. In this case, it's canine search and rescue. And obviously there's a romance and suspense plot to go along with it. But in any case, this book is very similar in tone to those other ones. Interpret that however you like.    Personally, I really enjoyed the canine S&R aspect of the book. Half because I'm a dog person and half because I find the topic of canine S&R fascinating. NR does a fabulous job of diving into the topic, giving readers a vibrant picture of canine S&R. I was hooked on that part of the book from the start. Is there too much detail, too much of a focus on the subject? Some might say yes, but I loved this aspect of the book. It totally worked for me.    On the character and romance front - I really liked both Fiona and Simon. Fiona is a strong woman to have gone through what she did and put her life back together. And Simon...he's a bit of an oddity. He's a bit surly, a bit broody, says what he thinks even if it's not always pretty...and yet, there was something really likable about him. Probably because underneath the loner surliness, he's a genuinely nice guy with a soft spot for a silly dog. I liked him. And I thought he and Fiona fit well together. Great chemistry between the two.    I did wish that A) Fiona's dialogue wasn't so rambly and psychoanalytical at times. There were times when things she said just came off as over-the-top too intuitive. And B) I wished there had been a little more conflict in the romantic relationship. It was a bit too smooth for me and I wanted a little more conflict between them before they settled into love. But these were mostly minor issues.    The suspense plot was where I had most of my issues with the book and what kept it from being a 5-star read. I liked the basic premise of the story: a woman who survives a serial killer, now a copy cat has risen and is coming after her. It sounded like it was going to be a great, creepy story. But as I read, that creepy tension, that edge-of-you-seat what's-going-to-happen-next intensity never developed. The suspense plot is sort of very lackadaisical, very low-intensity. You know early on who the killer is, why he's doing it, what he plans. There's no guesswork, other than wondering how at the end of the book he's going to get close to killing Fiona...because you KNOW that's going to happen (romantic suspense protocol, after all). And just the way the RSK thing happened in the background really sucked the intensity outof the story. I just wanted more from this suspense plot. Even the big ending didn't feel so bit. I was expecting and hoping for a big finale - a tense, life and death battle but the end, for me, felt a bit anti-climactic and flat. Which was disappointing.    Don't get me wrong, the suspense plot wasn't bad, but it didn't have enough bite for me. Maybe that's because it's a serial killer story, and those tend to be very creepy and tense, and this one just...wasn't. But it wasn't a bad plot at all. Just maybe not what I wanted from the story. It's balanced out, though, by how much I enjoyed the canine S&R stuff, the characters, and the romance.    For you NR fans, will you like this book? Probably. The dedicated fans will mostly likely like it, but those of you who haven't like the last few books as much, wished she wouldn't get so focused on a topic might have some issues with the book. For me, as a dedicated NR fan who has read almost everything she's written, I consider \\"The Search\\" a solid 4-star read.

B001NLKT60|5.0|I read and loved [[ASIN:B0015DROBO The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]. I did not find it hard to get into at all - although friends told me to keep going I was pretty much addicted from the beginning and never felt like there was down time.<br /><br />So I wisely did allocate this to be read over a weekend. I absolutely knew otherwise it would be just in the back of my mind all day long - interfering with work and other duties. Blomkvist and Salander are an amazing team - especially as they appear such a mismatch. The murders around which much of this novel center are interesting as well. The subject matter of the slave trade - and how the author portray's Sweden is despairing. I don't know, as point of fact, whether these novels represent the reality of modern Sweden (or 1990's Sweden) but certainly they strip the glamour away and stick a whole lotta questions in there instead.<br /><br />The pacing of this novel seemed tighter to me than DRAGON. Less talk and more action. It is odd that FIRE is largely about Salander but she is absent for much of it. A real testament to her strength in our minds. I was on pins and needles in several places and the only thing you could hear in my apartment was the click click of the Kindle next page button.<br /><br />A fabulous novel not to be missed. Enjoy!
B001FB5634|1.0|Hands down one of the worst post-apocalyptic movies I have ever seen.  The enemies are as shallow and mindless as zombies, the main character spends all of his time wondering if he should kill his own son and then himself.  Rather than self-reflective, the main character comes across as self-punishing and cowardly.<br /><br />Ignore this one. Go for [[ASIN:B002ZG997C The Book of Eli]].
B001EN71CW|5.0|You will find yourself looking forward to every interaction between every member of the ship.  The movie, Serenity, is really good, as well.
B002ZG997C|5.0|One of the finest post-apocalyptic movies ever made.  This is the story of a blind man carrying a braille New King James Bible from the east coast to Alcatraz, San Francisco.  The world is brutal, short of water, short of food, and short of compassion.  There are no zombies, no mutants, and no other weird monstrosities that writers will little or no imagination are so fond of resorting to in order to build tension and conflict.  There are only real people, some good, some bad, all struggling to stay alive in a world gone insane.<br /><br />Belongs right up there with Mad Max and The Postman.  Classic, powerful movies with so much going on beneath the surface that zombie-loving teenagers find them boring.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Personally, I watched the movie way before I saw the TV series.  I fell in love with the quip-filled dialogue and interesting characters.  Serenity also has a very good villain for you villain connoisseurs out there.    Only after watching the series, I can really appreciate how well this movie ties into the series.    The movie is not perfect for some (especially if you haven't watched the series).  But for me, I loved Serenity before I watched the TV series and even more after watching the 14 episodes.
0743298039|5.0|I'm going to be simple in my review because I don't think fawning over the book will really get anyone to take me seriously.<br />It was a good book and a good read. Admittedly, it doesn't take much for me to stamp a book with \\"couldn't put down\\" but this is one of the few where I didn't WANT to put it down. Her writing is elegant and the story moves well. You become immersed in the story of the girls and Margaret. The story of each pair of siblings is both amazing and heartbreaking. Mrs.Setterfield writes in a way that really makes you care for the characters.<br />I'd say the only part of the book that had me raising my eyebrow was the ending after the end. But it did nothing to ruin the story overall.
0805091742|4.0|Articulates forcefully the stunning efficacy of checklist as a means of reducing preventable errors, everywhere. Drags a bit in the middle though, but succeeds overall. Highly recommended.<br /><br />The book talks about the increasing complexity that is becoming the norm in most professions. Where complex operations are involved, from surgeries to flying an airplane to building a 1000 feet skyscraper, the knowledge needed to perform these tasks successfully exists. But it is the sheer complexity and the number of tasks that have to be performed that leads to failures.<br /><br />Failures because among all the hundreds of tasks that have to be performed by the dozens of people, one single task gets overlooked. The key lies in the ability to divvy up the tasks between the specialists, and then be able to monitor and track these individual tasks as they relate to the whole. Project plans are the norm in building projects. They are less often followed in the medical profession. For two reasons. The first is that medicine is a complex as well as a complicated profession. Not only are the steps required to accomplish a procedure many and difficult in themselves, but they can vary from patient to patient. The second is that in medicine, when you err, a patient may fall ill, or not recover in time, or at worst, die. In the case of airplanes, hundreds of passengers will most certainly die if complex procedures are not done right. In buildings, if the construction has not followed all applicable rules and guidelines, thousands could die.<br /><br />There are quite a few stereotypical myths that are demolished. Specifically, three of them. The first is of the surgeon as the solo artist who sweeps into an operating theater and with a wave of his magical hands puts things right. Not quite true. The second is of the master-builder who knows everything about constructing a building, from the plumbing to the wiring to the ventilation to the architectural blueprint... The third is that of airline pilots who know not only how to fly an airplane but also what to do when something goes wrong, or when one of several lights on the cockpit console starts blinking.<br /><br />The start of the book itself is riveting. The writing grabs you and you can't stop turning the pages. The introduction being off with a fellow doctor describing a case about a stab wound victim with a wound that was deeper than anything they expected.<br /><br />.... There are a thousand ways that things can go wrong when you've got a patient with a stab wound. But everyone involved got almost every step right - the head-to-toe examination, the careful tracking of the patient's blood pressure and pulse and rate of breathing, the monitoring of his consciousness, the fluids run in by IV, the call to the blood bank to have blood ready, the placement of a urinary catheter to make sure his urine was running clear, everything. Except no one remembered to ask the patient or the emergency medical technicians what the weapon was.<br /><br />....  \\"Your mind doesn't think of a bayonet in San Francisco,\\" John could only say.<br /><br />Turns out the man had been at a costume party, and the person who stabbed him after an altercation had been dressed as a soldier - with a bayonet.<br /><br />.... The ninth edition of the World Health Organization's international classification of diseases has grown to distinguish more than thirteen thousand different diseases, syndromes, and types of injury - more than thirteen thousand different ways, in other words, that the body can fail. And, for nearly all of them, science has given us things we can do to help. If we cannot cure the disease, then we can usually reduce the harm and misery it causes. But for each condition the steps are different and they are almost never simple. Clinicians now have at their disposal some six thousand drugs and four thousand medical and surgical procedures, each with different requirements, risks, and considerations. Itis a lot to get right. [page 19]<br /><br />To take a specific example, when we think about an ICU (Intensive Care Unit) at a hospital, we somehow conjure up this vision of a person lying in a bed, with needles and tubes running from him/her to a set of monitors, and all. But above all, the vision we have is one of quietude and solitude. It's just as if the very act of keeping the person in the ICU and running these tubes into him is all that is needed to stabilize and cure the person. We have movies to thank for this vision. But what about reality? Is it really that serene?<br /><br />.... Fifteen years ago, Israeli scientists published a study in which engineers observed patient care in ICUs for twenty-four-hour stretches. They found that the average patient required 178 individual actions per day, ranging from administering a drug to suctioning the lungs, and every one of them posed risks. Remarkably, the nurses and doctors were observed to make an error in just 1 percent of these actions - but that still amounted to an average of two errors a day with every patient.<br /><br />  ...<br /><br />....

Writing a full length book on a single topic is more challenging. Dr Gawande succeeds, mostly.fic example, when we think about an ICU (Intensive Care Unit) at a hospital, we somehow conjure up this vision of a person lying in a bed, with needles and tubes running from him/her to a set of monitors, and all. But above all, the vision we have is one of quietude and solitude. It's just as if the very act of keeping the person in the ICU and running these tubes into him is all that is needed to stabilize and cure the person. We have movies to thank for this vision. But what about reality? Is it really that serene?    .... Fifteen years ago, Israeli scientists published a study in which engineers observed patient care in ICUs for twenty-four-hour stretches. They found that the average patient required 178 individual actions per day, ranging from administering a drug to suctioning the lungs, and every one of them posed risks. Remarkably, the nurses and doctors were observed to make an error in just 1 percent of these actions - but that still amounted to an average of two errors a day with every patient.        ...    ....

0380977273|2.0|I bought this assuming to be enthralled by a 'dark carnival'; to be a bit frightened at the least, but I was more taken aback by the repetition of bradbury's wording. He uses words with like meanings in long strings and it got old rather quickly. Some parts are like reading entries in a Thesaurus; I skipped over these \\"defining\\" paragraphs/sentences after the first couple chapters.     The book was not 'wicked'; it isn't even as scary as some R.L. Stine books I dug up recently and those aren't even a fraction of the size and depth this attempts. With the name \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\", I was expecting wickedness worded out; twisted thoughts and evilness dealt out by a ominous force. No deal. The book is rather tame - by its name I was expecting Steven King but instead got Walt Disney.     It's a child's book. Had I known that, I wouldn't have bought it.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I was very anxious for Daria to be released on DVD ever since I read it on facebook. Granted I did get to watch the show every now and then on The N, but I hate watching the edited versions. I'm satisfied with the quality of the episodes and grateful that the full episodes is there and NOT the edited versions. I do kind of see what some people are referring to when they are talking about the music. I even know that there were songs replaced in episodes that I know where not there when I first watched them. I can get over it, but I do understand what some people are talking about. All in all, glad to finally see this show on DVD. :)
B0000084J7|5.0|This is a beautiful album. It reintroduced me to Talk Talk, and is one of my favorite albums in my collection of thousands. It's a great one for late at night with a glass of 18 year old mcallan's or some fine shishkaberry, whichever your poison. Highly recommended for aficionados of jazz and sparse, experimental music.
B002GQ74AK|5.0|Oh now come on guys.  This is really embarrassing.  I've never even had ONE friend in my entire life and this band apparently has three, haha.  If just one person out there would be my friend that would mean the absolute world to me.  So, who's it gonna be?  You?  I'll give you 5 bucks if you be my best friend. :)     All terrible joking aside, Three Friends excels in numerous aspects and could quite possibly be like, the very best Gentle Giant album ever.  Of all-time.  Like, totally!     Speaking of sassy teenage cheerleader-like speech patterns (with my whole \\"Like totally\\" comment if you don't catch my drift, you slow poke!) check out \\"Schooldays\\".   Well I can say with 100% certainty that MY schooldays were never as pleasant as this song makes them seem.  No sir.       My 12 years of school were filled with tension, fear, disappointment and anger as I'd either get a lecture from my parents whenever I failed a history or math assignment, or (perhaps even worse) I'd have to put up with other kids in my class constantly picking on me and throwing pink eraser heads at my face.  NOT good memories.   I STILL have no idea how I managed to pass 9th grade.  I was failing every single class that particular year except science, and you weren't allowed to fail more than two subjects or that was IT and you'd have to repeat the grade.  I... passed?  I passed!  A miracle out of nowhere indeed.     I WILL say this however- the memories of me throwing balls of clay at this one boy in 7th grade art class was easily the highlight of my school years.  Too bad the teacher got so upset over the incident that she reached a point where she said \\"The next person to throw clay will immediately get a detention\\".  That of course, prompted all the students to change their ways in a hurry and straighten up!  Sit up straight, and pay attention!       I really should have listened to all my teachers and sat up straight because now my lower back is completely shot.  All well.  I'll survive.  Just let me struggle to get out of bed every single day of my life and I'll be ready to go!     Anyway, this song has xylophones played in such a way that makes you feel at complete ease.  Like you've just climbed the highest mountain on the planet and finally reached spiritual enlightenment.  Where all the greatest leaders the world has ever known are standing there and waiting for your arrival.   \\"You did it, my boy!\\"  The xylophones also makes you feel all tickly underneath your toes like your mom used to do whenever she wanted to squeeze the truth out of your lying ways.  \\"Oh mom, stop it!\\"  *laughs uncontrollably*     \\"Working All Day\\" has lyrics that probably remind you of Willy Wonka's Oompa Loompa's working on a thousand different chocolatey-related things at once!  Inside your little world of imagination, you see a nice view of the entire factory as you enter that huge room with huge doors, and see that incredible world of chocolate just WAITING for you to explore.  Don't go down that chocolate river until the Oompa Loompa's give you permission either- you might regret it!       Despite all the positive vibes, I sure hope \\"Working All Day\\" doesn't remind you of that one spoiled girl from the storyline who wanted ALL the candy for herself.  She was insanely hard to get along with.  Just ask the other kids around her.  At least with such an incredible album like Three Friends, it feels like *you* are the one who gets all the chocolate (in a non-spoiled way).  Or rather, like the entire Wonka factory was created just for you, hehe.       \\"Prologue\\" (sorry, I should have mentioned this song first since it's track one, but I didn't so just roll with me!) features a really evil sounding guitar riff.  That riff alone dominates a good portion of the 5 minute song.  I don't know what else to say other than... move over Black Sabbath and Blue Oyster Cult!  I bet this is how the devil likes his evil.  It's a dark world baby, so you better get used to it.     \\"Peel thePaint\\" is a sophisticated art museum display of illustrious amazement... and a high IQ level of exquisite tastes to boot!  Whatever you do though, do NOT develop this horrible personality change where you look down on people who you believe are inferior to you in every single aspect of life.  This is assuming you DO eventually develop these intricate and pompous tastes.   You don't wanna become arrogant and be look upon as somewhat of a know-it-all.  \\"Peel the Paint\\" seriously contains the kind of songwriting and atmosphere to make something like that happen, though unlikely.  Like a 45% chance it'll happen. :)     The classical-influenced orchestration in the beginning leads way to a funky and much heavier section later on, but it's the classical bit that floors me the hardest.  It's so melodic and beautiful and just perfect in so many delightfully confusing ways... and it's so WEIRD that *I* of all people would be amazed by the classical section above everything else.  I, too, must be developing exquisite tastes!  Let me stand tall and look down on you all, haha.     \\"Mister Class & Quality\\" is funky and rocking... but let's not believe Three Friends should be tagged as a funk album.  No, this music is *still* coming from a highly talented progressive rock band that specializes in many genres and wraps them all up into one adorable little ball of warm fun (like a puppy who's sleeping in his doggy bed- you just wanna cuddle up to that sleeping four-legged mut).  Don't you DARE tell me you don't get urges to sleep with adorable animals either, you dog hater, hehe.     Anyway, this song contains a really lengthy instrumental break with magnificent guitar playing.  Usually the guitar playing of Gentle Giant is incredible, but now it's MAGNIFICENT.  Using big letters makes a word with lesser impact like \\"magnificent\\" seem MORE impactful than a word like \\"incredible\\", hehe.  Ain't that funny?  I make the rules now!     Then the title song follows up immediately (withoutdelay)... and it might possibly remind you VERY MUCH of the Yes song \\"To Be Over\\" (from their Relayer album) because of that hypnotic guitar jam at the end.  It's so reminiscent of that jam.  It's just so darn awesome, isn't it?   ISN'T IT?  You better say yes *shakes fist*.  I won't accept no for an answer!       Nothing beats the classic period of Gentle Giant.  Nothing.  Nothing can compete with it either.  Nothing beats nor competes!  Oh sure, King Crimson, Genesis and Yes can probably compete (and perhaps Caravan, Van Der Graaf Generator, Soft Machine and Jethro Tull give Gentle Giant a run for their money as well) but rest assured- no other rock band was EVER (nor will ever) be able to stand in the same amazing league as these guys.        This is just brilliant stuff.  Songwriting?  Yes!  Loads of songwriting!  Songs written in clever, tricky ways *nonstop* for your listening pleasure.  An original and distinctive sound and style?  Yes, I must have said this a million times by now (and yes, you don't have to say it- I probably sound like your grandmother's broken record by now) because you can NEVER say too much about this bands original style.  Just being the coolest band ever?  Absolutely.  Do FM radio stations agree?   Nah, FM stations never even heard of these guys.  Shame on them!       Three Friends is a must buy no matter how tall you are.  Everyone's allowed on this ride.  Jump on, hold on tight and don't let go.
B000KN7BIQ|1.0|Don't know if the format is as bad as they say because none of my DVDs will read the disc.
B000001FW9|5.0|I may be completely off my rocker, but I believe this album SHOULD have been called \\"Requiring the Taste\\" instead.  That way you'd be required to listen to it, therefore adding much needed variety to your musical tastes (which may or may not be necessary since I don't know you personally), therefore encouraging every single musician out there to strive harder, therefore preventing the music scene from eventually falling apart and stinking like a room of rotten turkey corpses (which is what music is like today- I so vehemently believe!)    But the whole darn thing fell apart, didn't it?  Now musicians just don't care as much. Lack of motivation?  I don't know.  Perhaps. Lack of talent?   Again, I don't know.  It's a cryin', stinkin' shame I tell ya.  Who's to blame?  Well I want to say it's *your* fault but I'm not the kind of guy to point fingers so let's just say it's somebody's fault (like always).  Ain't nobody willing to take responsibility for their own darn actions anymore.      Oh who am I kidding?  It's entirely my fault.  Just look at the shameful look on my face.  It's a dead giveaway. :)    Anyway, anybody can \\"acquire\\" something just by being a thief- it takes true discipline (and a police club) to require it.      Anyway, with that self-centered (and quite possibly dead wrong) little rant out of the way, let's move forward in typical fashion with a review of Acquiring the Taste.   I almost typed \\"Required\\" again right there, haha.  I guess that proves just how convinced I am that the album title should have been what *I* suggested.  But don't listen to me!  I don't know anything!    \\"Pantagruel's Nativity\\" is NOT how you should open an album when you're Gentle Giant.  Musically it's only *somewhat* off the radar, and that just doesn't make a lick of sense when you're these guys.  Oh okay, Acquiring the Taste is only the bands second album so we'll cut them a bit of slack and assume the weirdness factor hasn't yet permanently crawled inside their exceptionally talented little minds yet.  We'll assume the band had yet to truly define their sound and style.  Yeah I know people say \\"Never assume anything\\" but for the sake of this review, I clearly don't have a choice here.      Anyway, about the opening song.  We'll just call it \\"the opening song\\" for now on since I don't really feel like typing out two humongous words anymore.  It's July and it's 95 degrees outside with really sticky humidity in southeast Pennsylvania, so you must forgive my lazy ways.  Lazy days and lazy ways.  That defines me to a tee.      Anyway, it's a good song, and I can't help but wonder if the lead singer is going for an operatic style when he sings that verse melody.  The flutes in the background just make the magical land of fairy tale pictures in your head even stronger.  It's weird how the vocal melody and flutes just suddenly STOP on a dime so that fascinating instrumental chop can do its thing.  It's really strange, but that's what Gentle Giant does best.    \\"Edge of Twilight\\" reminds me of Harry Potter's castle.  Like, when you've been busy all day walking through a foggy forest, and you eventually stumble upon a castle.  You're like \\"Whoa, how neato!\\"  \\"Edge of Twilight\\" captures that foggy mysterious feeling better than... the Pirates can catch a fly ball out, hehe.  I AM a big baseball fan so expect some references from time to time.  Football too.    The VERY BEST SONG on the entire album is clearly (with no competition) \\"The House, the Street, the Room\\".  I just love everything about this mysteriously written song.  The quiet vocal melody speeds along at such an eerie pace, and unlike other times when Gentle Giant writes a mellow song, this time you actually get the feeling it's going to PICK UP and go somewhere interesting... and it does!  These vocals will definitely remind you of the Keebler elves making cookies and crackers in that make believe tree factory of theirs.  They make ice cream cones too, I just found out.      Notthat I'm saying the band can't write a mellow song from time to time... do NOT put words in my mouth because you'll only end up confusing me (and that's the last thing I need when I can't even remember what I wrote five seconds ago- I already completely forgot!)  It's just that, Gentle Giant is definitely at their very best when they completely let loose with these outrageous, sophisticated jams involving tricky time signatures that you'd never expect anyone to write.  Expect the unexpected, bucko (again, another Pirates reference- I TOLD you I'd occasionally put one in there!)    Anyway, WOW!  When \\"The House, the Street, the Room\\" turns extremely heavy halfway through, the rhythm section takes a trip to some gypsy palace in Egypt, and soon after that the guitar solo shows off its amazing level of complexity.  How in the world did the band write stuff like this?  Who knows, and any explanation will just confuse me anyway so don't even bother telling me (if you happen to know).    \\"Wreck\\" is a normal song.  It sounds like pirate music though (no, not a baseball reference this time, haha).  I mean actual pirates getting drunk and partying on the open sea with no concern for anything except, well, lots and lots of shiny gold, mate.  \\"The Moon is Down\\" is yet ANOTHER extremely mellow song, however in this case the song is immediately elevated to greatness because of the vocal melody alone, and the fascinating way in which it is sung.  The song still contains some of the bands distinctly weird trademark sounds (you can hear them taking place in the background) but I don't know exactly what they are.   Maybe keyboards, maybe something else entirely.      You can just imagine walking outside of a building somewhere in London, looking up to the sky and seeing the moon playing tricks in a way that could completely and permanently damage your brain because it defies rational thinking.  Such as... oh I don't know, the moon darting around all over the sky at lightning speed?Wouldn't it be really weird to see the moon doing that?  Wouldn't you feel like passing out and breaking out into cold sweats by not being able to explain it?  Just listen to the vocals and the atmosphere in this song and you'll hear EXACTLY what I mean.      \\"Black Cat\\" reminds me of cat burglars who quietly and precisely break locks off your home windows, sneak inside and tiptoe around.  You don't even realize they're in your home because your bed is so cozy and warm that you've fallen into a deep sleep.  Hopefully your home security system is up to snuff.  Always lock your doors and windows at night because you just never know.  Don't get into a routine where you think your home will always be safe either- burglars pay attention to this kind of stuff.  The strings in this song really reinforce the \\"tiptoeing\\" part involving the burglars, too.  I love it.  Then the tempe changes appear and the tension builds!  You then wake up the next morning to find all your jewelry is missing.  NOT fun.    Ah... it was your ex-wifes jewelry anyway, so it could have been worse. :)    \\"Plain Truth\\" is mostly memorable for, well... being really long first of all (around 9 awesome minutes- wow!) and secondly, being dominated with violins in a way that would make the Mahavishnu Orchestra stand up and take notice.  Nah, nothing can top the Mahavishnu Orchestra, but I'm sure had the band members ever attended a Gentle Giant concert in the 70's, they would have enjoyed what they heard.       I LOVE the vocal melody too!  It reminds me of early Kansas material.  I don't care if Kansas is a secondrate cheesy attempt at progressive rock- this song resembles Kansas.  No not the STATE of Kansas.  Then all we'd hear is the sound of fully developed cornstalks blowing next to a mooing pooing cow.    You better get this album, and get it now.  Expect an overall heavy emphasis on peaceful vibes and mellow vocal melodies, and less on the outrageous nature of the otherwise absolutely INSANE musical chops of the band (featured on albums like In a Glass House, for example).  Every bad boy has his soft side, and Gentle Giant is no exception.
B002ZG997M|3.0|I purchased the movie in Blu-Ray but because of the scenery and the entire drabness of the movie's filming, you don't really get much of the true Blu-Ray experience.
0470876417|5.0|The other reviewers have already told you what the book says... I would like to tell you what the book can do. Knowing how your business is organized... from who your customers are, to what process you use to deliver your value proposition, to how that creates your revenue streams... all good stuff, and useful. But, you either grow your business or go out of business. There is no standing still. That S.O.B. down the street wants your customers. You need to find new ways to keep them. This book gives you a pattern to not only identify your current business model, but by using the same tools, to also figure out ways to build tomorrow's version of your business.    In fact I would venture to say that there is more information in the book on planning the future than there is on defining your current business model. (If you are just getting started figuring out your business model - this book will help you too; but I suspect that most readers will already be in business - I doubt most rookies would use the phrase 'business model generation' and therefore will come across this book further down their entrepreneurial path.)    And my highest compliment of all is that this is the first business book that I have encountered that is friendly to visual thinkers. Although its an illustrated business book, it feels more like an annotated illustration to me. As most of my staff are designers and artists by education, this method of presenting the information was particularly useful to us.
B001HN6940|3.0|This is the type of movie that drives one crazy with the up and down of volume. When using surround sound, you constantly have to lower the volume during action scenes and raise the volume during dialog. However thru Blu-Ray the coloring in the movie was amazing, the characters sharp and vivid and wild.
B000V8A95C|5.0|I just saw this yesterday in San Francisco, so I might not make perfect sense.  Forgive me in advance.  I didn't know what to expect, as I had not read the novel.  I wasn't prepared to be so emotionally moved by the performance!  The voices, the score, the set, the costumes were so much more....and the story.  The story was written by a genius, to be sure.  A story that I think we are all so familiar with, this made me feel like it was written first.  The songs were a beautiful continuation of the story, leading us.  Not any filler songs that could be done without.  You must see this to understand the reviews.

B0039UTDFG|1.0|I am a loyal BBC fan, and own many of their previous Attenborough-narrated series.  Usually, the cinematography is fabulous, the subject matter remarkably fascinating, the narration inspiring, and overall the result is brilliant.  They're educational movies that you absolutely love seeing.  Not with this series however, thanks to the incredibly indefensible choice of Oprah as a narrator.  Whoever came up with the genius idea of using her voice instead of Attenborough should at the very least be fired, if not sued for ear injury.  I'd give this zero stars if Amazon allowed it.    After having endured the first few episodes and finally given up on watching the rest,  I can honestly say I am a fool for spending the money without knowing the original Attenborough narration is also available.  Sadly, turning off the pathetic narrated audio and leaving the subtitles still distracts from the brilliant visual material.  This version is totally unwatchable for anyone who actually uses the English language to communicate.  It lacks both the usual BBC depth of content, and any attention to the spoken word itself.  Regardless of who is at fault for the corny modified dialogue (as it's clear from the narration that Oprah had no concern for the subject matter), she cannot manage to pronounce even the apparently dumbed-down material.  As an example, she regularly alternates between \\"shpecies\\" and \\"species\\" and cannot manage to pronounce \\"Antarctica\\" after numerous random tries.  She's a frickin zillionaire, could she maybe pay a voice coach?  Regardless, the end result here is utter misery.  Definitely not one I thought I would ever see/hear on a proper BBC series.    May I suggest perhaps that Oprah have a special show, where they give away the original version of the series to guests, after refunding to them the money they've spent on this load of dung?  I've just re-ordered the original Attenborough-narrated version, and if I could return this garbage I would; Oprah's \\"Life\\" will be going to the refuse bin instead.

At 15.2 x 15.2 cms and 638 pages this book is more like a box of photos - a wonderfully diverse photographic exploration of China's people and culture.<br /><br />The magic of photography is that it captures a glimpse in time that would otherwise be lost, an insight into another world. This is a book that belongs on the coffee table not the bookshelf. A treasure to be shared. Thank you, Tom Carter.
B001OQCV9M|4.0|Julie & Julia [Theatrical Release] (2009) was a good four star film with great acting. I enjoyed this film and its good story and was amazed at how fine a job Meryl Streep did at playing a very believable Julia Child. Naturally, being a dedicated sci-fi and horror addict, I had to be talked into seeing this chick flick by my wife who enjoyed this film, as did my cousin.  However, my male counterpart from that part of the family walked out on the movie muttering something about meeting us after the film and stepping on my feet on his way out. I guess that's a single two star vote for the guy side of the family.
B003KUSUG8|4.0|Eminem has effectively won over an alternative rock girl with his talent, brutal honesty, and emotion. The album reveals a more mature Eminem--one who bears the scars of overcoming addiction, losing love, and winning a war against himself. To the benefit of his audience, these scars join with the talent we already knew he had to produce a truly enjoyable--if typically raw--album.
B002JVWR0Y|5.0|Obviously, this was a spectacular season just based on the awards, media buzz, and reviews it got, but is it worth buying opposed to just renting or watching on-line? In my opinion, absolutely yes!<br /><br />Season 4 of Dexter was without a doubt the best season of any TV show I have ever watched. Season 1-3 were excellent, but season 4 took everything to a new level. I, like many others, had my doubts about John Lithgow being cast as the main antagonist (the Trinity Killer) this time around, but he did a spectacular job and really comes across as exactly what he set out to portray: a family-man/serial killer of a different mold than Dexter. He really knows how to give that look that just send chills down your spine. Watching John Lithgow and Michael C. Hall at their very best was a pure treat during season 4.<br /><br />Without giving anything away about the story, I will just say that side stories were decent during the season, but it all comes back to the interactions between Dexter and the Trinity Killer. The twists and turns the writing provides really make you want to keep watching more and more. Be sure you have plenty of time on your hands when you start watching this season, because you won't be able to stop. And once you are done with the season, you will want to go back and watch it more... just to pick up on those small intricacies you might have missed the first time.<br /><br />While Dexter isn't one of those shows that throws out great special effects or scenes that would really seem to thrive on blu-ray opposed to standard definition, I've found watching the standard versions of Dexter to be flat in a way. It has something about it in the scenery and the way it's filmed that really leaves more of an impression on you in high def (at least in my opinion). I thought about going standard definition just to save some money and have a little more \\"portability\\" in it in case I want to bring it to someone else's house, but figure I will enjoy it infinitely more by going with the blu-ray.he blu-ray.
B00000K0E5|5.0|Directed by Martin Campbell, GOLDENEYE makes the transition to a more modern image for the James Bond series. Bond's out-of-date womanizing is presented with a feminist challenge from the newly cast Judi Dench as an impenetrable M, and Samantha Bond as a wiser and more forthright Moneypenny. The action sequences, replete with helicopter hijinks and copious explosions, are complex and stylish, making the film a polished sensation. This installment in the series introduces actor Pierce Brosnan in the role of suave, debonair, irresistible 007. Despite the end of the Cold War, James Bond still finds himself pitted against nefarious Russians who want to rule the world. This time around, his enemies are a gang of mobsters and former military men who have gained access to the Goldeneye, which can cut off electrical currents in London. Alec Trevelyan (Sean Bean) is the leader, with General Ourumov (Gottfried John) an additional threat. Sizzling Bond babe Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen) is the sleek robber who, with Ourumov, successfully steals the Goldeneye, which the villains plan to use in their quest to control financial markets around the globe. However, this grizzly group of scoundrels is no match for Bond, who constantly outwits their attempts to assassinate him. Bond rescues the tough and lovely Natalya Simonova (Izabella Scorupco), who was caught in Trevalyan's deadly web, and she eventually helps Bond turn the tables on his foes as he uses his quick instincts, innovative weapons, and cool gadgetry to save the day.
B003CN5B6K|5.0|White collar is one of those shows with a premise that could either be really good or really bad. Luckily, it comes off as extremely fun and addicting thanks to USA network's mantra of character-driven programming. If you are looking for a show that is high on drama, superb acting, and is just masterful in every way possible, look elsewhere. If you want a show that is just fun to watch, and has a highly entertaining cast and plot, this is a fantastic show.<br /><br />Basically, Neal Caffery (Matt Bomer) is an extremely good white collar thief/counterfeiter (hence the name of the show) who finally gets caught by FBI agent, Peter Burke (Tim DeKay). They make a deal where Neal will be let out of jail with an ankle bracelet if he helps the FBI in some of their cases. Neal turns out to be a great aid in solving cases and often \\"bends\\" the rules a little to get the info he needs. Several supporting characters are intertwined with them too and add a lot to the show: Mozzie (Willie Garson), Neal's friend and link to the underground crime world, gives the show a dose of much needed comedy, Elizabeth Burke (Tiffani Thiessen), who is Peter's wife, etc...<br /><br />The show started off slow, with many of the episodes being one-shot episodes where a problem comes up, they solve it, end of show. But towards the middle of the season, the show really takes off. They start to involve more underlying plots and the writing really throws some twists at you. All this time, the characters start to get more and more developed so you start to learn more about their motivations and what makes them tick.<br /><br />I highly recommend this season, if not just to get caught up on everything that has happened so you can watch the spectacular show that it is now. It's sure to be the latest in a string of successes for USA network.
0618918248|5.0|This is a book that captures you so much that you only put it aside to search for more Richard Dawkins books to buy.<br />Dawkins carefully builds his argument to reach the conclusion that with the evidence at hand, it is almost certain that no supreme being stands behind the so-called \\"intelligent design,\\" which was not \\"created\\" as many believe, but has rather been the result of the accumulation of a process of \\"natural selection,\\" as was first described by Charles Darwin.<br />Even though the book is well organized, it feels at times like a chitchat session with the author, who delves into socio-political debates, which are currently in the news, and argues for women's rights, abortion and homosexuality, among other issues. By the time you finish reading the book, you will find a list of links to websites of like-minded organizations. Dawkins also recommends books of a similar nature.<br />In the final tally, Dawkins goes beyond presenting a scientific, social, psychological and anthropological argument against the existence of god. His book becomes an ideology pamphlet for like-minded atheists, agnostics and humanists. This adds to the book's allure.<br />What also makes the book interesting is Dawkins' wit. Dawkins strikes the correct balance between his entertaining sarcasm and the serious tone required in books like The God Delusion.<br />For those interested in the intellectual debate over the existence of god - like the one presented in this book - you might enjoy parts more than others. Those who are into scrutinizing divine texts to determine the authenticity of their call have to wait as they read Dawkins chapter after chapter. Perhaps not originally planned as such, The God Delusion first presents the scientific debate (Darwinism), then the philosophical debate (social Darwinism), and last tackles texts from the Old and New Testaments.<br />Dawkins, a scientist by training, which makes him excel in the scientific debate, also does a wonderful job in the human sciences part of his book.<br />Dawkins brilliantly drives home the idea that morality is not rooted in religion, but in human genes. He also shows how the exclusivity of religions, what he calls the in-group call for justice and bonding, is in fact a source of division if taken in a bigger context. While religions introduce noble and fairly humane (though male chauvinist and anti-women's rights) practices within their own groups, they shamelessly call for ruthlessly annihilating other groups that endorse different creeds.<br />Dawkins correctly, yet briefly, argues that within each religious scripture there are the verses that call for moderation, and the ones that encourage devilish behavior. Those who call themselves moderates, in every religion, are the ones who cherry-pick by rejecting whatever radical text and endorsing the moderate parts. Those who are fanatic, such as Islamist radicals and what Dawkins calls the \\"American Taliban,\\" are the ones who endorse their creeds - in their entirety including the non-moderate teachings - and live by them.<br />The only downside to this book is its brief treatment of Islamic texts, a limitation that Dawkins - born and raised in a predominantly Judeo-Christian world - noted in his preface.<br />The God Delusion is a great work.

B001SRDDQM|4.0|In one of its first reviews, in 1963, this book was called \\"the first feminine novel in a Salinger mood.\\" The narrator certainly has that unique outsider's perspective on a world of which she appears to be part--so typical of Salinger's work. While Esther Greenwood has the outward trappings of a successful college student, she is in reality merely acting the role expected of her by society, increasingly unable to see the point.<br /><br />The powerful thing about this novel is that, despite her impending breakdown, it is easy to understand and identify with so much of Esther's thinking. Her despair is initially rooted in a concern quite common to young adults--but brilliantly expressed--that the myriad *felt* possibilities of life can never be realized in a structured (and stifling) world:<br /><br />\\"I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story.  From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked.... I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose.  I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, Esther's despair continues to deepen, as  even the most successful futures begin to seem empty, all effort towards them pointless. In the end, even daily life becomes devoid of meaning:<br /><br />\\"I saw the days of the year stretching ahead like a series of bright, white boxes, and separating one box from another was sleep, like a black shade.  Only for me, the long perspective of shades that set off one box from the next day had suddenly snapped up, and I could see day after day after day glaring ahead of me like a white, broad, infinitely desolate avenue.\\"<br /><br />While this transition accompanies a real psychological illness, we experience it through Esther's own thoughts. As a result, the progression of anguish seems natural, consistent, and even sensible. For this, the book has been justly praised for its insight into the inner workings of a troubled mind.<br /><br />In summary, I enjoyed both the beauty of the prose as well as the unique narrative perspective, which offers a troubling but fascinating glimpse of mental disorder. Throughout, sprinklings of humor, intelligent feminist thought, and echoes of Sylvia Plath's own life keep the novel engaging as well as entertaining. (I recommend this edition, which contained just enough background material on Plath and the book's publication to put the work in proper context).logical illness, we experience it through Esther's own thoughts.

0765350386|5.0|Im not much of a review writer, but this book was good enough to inspire one. I just finished it last night after a marathon read all day. Having read a review or 2 from other readers, some of their points are fair (sub-character development, some dialog), but it was a long book with a definite plot climax that needed to be achieved... I give Sanderson a pass in this book on that. The editorials above capture the plot, but fail to call out the most compelling aspect of the book. Allomancy is fascinating, and the way Sanderson develops it through Vin's character was in my opinion one of the best reads in a long, long time. I'm very excited to read the rest of the series, and can only hope that he continues to build on the depth of characters and subtleties of Allomancy so that the next 2 are as good as the first.<br /><br />If you're a fan of fantasy novels, you absolutely cannot go wrong with this book. It may not be your favorite, but you won't be bored with it.
0375842209|5.0|I enjoy reading historical fiction with a setting during Nazi Germany.  This book was the best I've read in a long time.  I liked it even better than Sarah's Key, which I thought was outstanding in itself.  The characters come alive in The Book Thief, and I couldn't put it down.  It felt like I was there with Liesel, participating in her life changes and struggles right with her.  A pleasure to read.

The book tells about the power of subconscious, the power and dangers of decisions that we take in a blink. I was always amazed by the current behavior of the cops in the US and why two cops don't ride together when they have to wait for a cover anyway! This book provides answers to many questions of the subconscious and poses many more which remain unanswered! Where to use the power of blink and where not! Just like the Inception !!!\\" . The only reason I am taking one point off is because it left me confused.

0345448898|5.0|First of all, it blows my mind that this is considered a children's series at all. I read it in my 20s, beginning shortly after college, where I majored in English and minored in Religious Studies, and I was deeply moved by this series as a collection of fantastical fantasy stories as well as a surprisingly profound and complex religious allegory.<br /><br />This is the one series I know of where people commonly only read the first book, perhaps because it's the one that has a movie based on it. But that is a waste of time. The first book is fun, and certainly good enough to keep you hooked for another round. But the series builds upon itself in the kind of way that prevents you from saying the last book is necessarily the *best*, because they're all inseparable, but certainly by the end you'll find yourself far more moved and invested than you would have seen coming when you began, or at least in a very different way.<br /><br />The series is fascinating, immensely joyous, heartbreaking, and gripping. I would recommend it to most anyone. I can certainly imagine that many Christians (and perhaps some other very religious people as well) will be hugely turned off by the series, especially The Amber Spyglass. And I certainly wouldn't get the books for young children... I imagine much of the story would be pretty frightening for them.<br /><br />I found myself longing for the stories to never end, and wanting to know more about the characters and places within; I hope Pullman puts out even more post-HDM supplements than the teasers (such as Lyra's Oxford) he's already provided.<br /><br />Also, for the record, the \\"boxed set\\" (it appears to actually be three books in one binding) pictured is not the version I have, but I could not find my exact boxed set on Amazon.com, and the stories are the important part.
031606792X|1.0|It's really too bad that Stephanie Meyer gave up on her characters in her final book.  I was a big fan of the first three books, but I read the finale with an unmelting look of disgust on my face.  Meyer did not test her characters or give them any significant challenges to face, instead spending 700 pages finding ways to force a \\"happily ever after\\" ending on nearly every character she had created, whether they deserved them or not, and whether doing so was justified by the overall story she had created or not.  Sadly, Meyer undid everything she had built over the previous three books with her immature, cop-out solutions.    If you were a fan of the first three books, I know it will be nearly impossible not to read Breaking Dawn.  Like me, you will really want to know how the story ends.  But do yourself a favor--don't expect much, and support your public library on this one.

B003NX76BM|2.0|Wow, the first couple of chapters were great...Nora moving the plot right along! At that point I heartily recommended this author and book to my friends.    What happened to the pace? We sink into vapid romance and OHHHHHHHHHHHHHH so wonderful sex scenes. The protagonists are way above average in every way....chapters and chapters touting their superior skills and personalities.    The information about the dogs was good, but extremely plentiful....uh this is a suspense novel???    The ending sucks.    This was my Nora Roberts trial.....back to Sue Grafton for me.
0563486430|4.0|\\"The Stone Rose\\" is a novel very in keeping with the Tennant era of Dr. Who which is both its main good point and its largest weakness. On the upside, the feel of a 10th Doctor adventure is very much present and it's very easy to imagine Tennant and Piper saying their characters' lines while reading. The idea that the Doctor can be very forgiving and very dangerous is also touched on but only briefly as this story is mostly fairly light-hearted.    While the good aspects of the Tennant years are there so are many of the things that bothered me when I would watch the show. The sonic screwdriver is the solution to all problems and the Doctor seems to speak in a hyper and quirky way just for the sake of doing so. The Doctor and Rose also show a maddening lack of genre savvy about the whole statue situation.     Overall this book is a quick, but entertaining read. But that light nature also works against it as I'd call this more of a borrow than a buy.
031606792X|2.0|Let me just say Stefanie Meyer is so talented. But I must say I am so disappointed, @ how the book turned out. She should have wrote a chapter on Jacob & Renesmae. Doesn't she know that 50% of readers were routing on Jacob. SSSSSSSSSSSSSsooooo, let down.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I really liked this series when I saw it on TV. It was about time they got it on dvd. Its got all the episodes, Is it Fall Yet?, Is It College Yet?, some other extras.

B000M341RI|5.0|The ONLY bad thing I can say about this movie is that some of the \\"English\\" is so muddled that it is hard to understand at times. Other than that, it is one of the best piceses of writing and acting to EVER come out of Great Britain!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have tried lots of exercise programs and hated them.  I am a working mom and have two small children, and I do not have time to go to the gym nor spend an hour in front of the TV doing a video.  This video is GREAT.  It combines cardio, strength, and abs in a 25 minute workout.  Make no mistake, this video is not easy, and you definitely get \\"worked out\\" in the 25 minutes-there is NO down time in this video!  My arms were sore the first several times that I did it.  I have combined this DVD with Jillian's Yoga Meltdown video and I alternate them through the week.  I also alternate these videos with swimming that I do several nights a week.  I can really tell a difference and it is just what I needed to have an exercise plan. This video combined with the Yoga video and swimming that I do helps me not to get burned out on one thing.  Very highly recommended for those seeking a good, quick, effective exercise video.
B0037QGS0A|4.0|I'd insist over and over again if being asked, the only reason I watched this is because of the fiercely honest, highly intuitive acting giantress of our time, Julianna Moore - NOT Amanda Seyfried, oh how un straight I am!<br /><br />With Moore, you simply cannot do femme fatale and human alibi wrong. When will the Academy finally crown her for just one time sake?
B002ZG982S|2.0|First off, this movie was filmed twice. The original director turned his cut in and then the studio hired another guy (uncredited) to reshoot almost the entire movie. He added the stupid talk to the dead stuff and the super weapon garbage. If you read the original script, the one where Thomas Jane all but begged to star in, it is a hard \\"R\\" violent, vengeance driven western. I have long been a Jonah Hex fan and when I heard about them making this movie, I put in my \\"JOSEY WALES\\" dvd and got out my 1970-1972 comic books and hoped for the best. Although I was disappointed, it was still fun to watch.
0446618322|4.0|I don't usually read Nicholas Sparks. But, I am on vacation in a remote area and I needed something to read. I picked this up at the grocery store and started reading. It was very good. An Iraqi Marine Veteran, Logan Thibault, finds a picture while jogging in the desert one morning. He pins it up on the bulletin board and hopes someone will claim it. Many days later he takes the picture for himself. It is the picture of a beautiful girl. From that moment one, his luck began to change. Could it be the picture? When he gets out of the Marines, he goes in search of the girl. This book was very entertaining. It is a perfect story to read on vacation. I will probably read Nicholas Sparks again in the future.

B003ES5JE2|5.0|I have to classify this movie as a minor masterpiece.  I give most of the credit to the screenwriter.  Hollywood's live-action superhero movie producers and writers can learn a lesson here about how to write a screenplay properly when creating comics-based movies.  The problems have always been the fact that there is a big audience that knows the stories and a large audience that does not know the stories.  The major comics-based movies are all tainted by the supposed need to explain everything and introduce characters to those who know nothing.  Likewise, they have to depart from directly adapting the beginning, middle, and ending of previously published stories - no matter how good the original stories may be.  These supposed limits have resulted in a long string of mediocre live-action superhero movies.<br /><br />However, this script deftly and effectively provides all necessary backstory and context so seamlessly and effortlessly that I have to wonder why the big studios never tell the story and make the movies the way it is done here.  That this movie is animated is no explanation.  With all the advances in live-action, this identical movie could be made with actors, sets, special effects and CGI no problem.  The tools of movies are not the problem with movies.  It's always been the writing that limits comics-based movies.<br /><br />All the Batman fans are familiar with the story and know all the spoilers.  That problem is dealt with masterfully by the script by weaving it into the tale early on.  The 50 years of comic history Hollywood would tediously explain to a new audience is dealt with perfectly using brief, in-context flashbacks, imagery and dialogue that never interrupts the story.  The professionalism and polish of the script is in \\"Casablanca\\" territory.  Every line and scene moves the story, nothing is left out that is needed and nothing is put in that isn't.<br /><br />The voice acting is good.  The actor playing the Joker is the best Joker voiceyet.  I have no idea how Andrea Romano is able to cast these DC animated movies so well and keep picking the right voices.  Not a false note among any of the casting choices.  The characters here ring true to form.  I think they really got this one right.  The Marvel animated producers and creators are put to shame again.

B000JSI7AI|5.0|I absolutely adore this movie.  It is one of my Top 10 Favorites!  I have literally watched it so many times I know almost all the lines..  I usually end up annoying the people I watch it with  lol.<br /><br />It's a wonderful romance story about 2 ordinary people who fall in love, who happen to be two men, and in the time period it was set it wasn't an ordinary situation to say the least.  So they had to keep it secret and live separate lives which put a huge strain on their relationship with each other.<br /><br />Deals with the one thing we all have in common ( no matter what sex, race or religion we are) and that is LOVE.  All of us can relate.  We have all felt the passion and the warmth of love, we've all felt the hurt and heartache love can bring us as well.<br /><br />This is one of the best movies of all time in my opinion.  Brilliant performances by Heath Ledger & Jake Gyllenhaal.  A must SEE and a must HAVE in your DVD collection.
0399156577|4.0|Any time a writer is as prolific as Nora Roberts is, there's always a danger she'll get tapped out and start just \\"phoning\\" it in.  So, unlike some of the reviewers, I welcomed the new blood in the form of the dog training angle.  If anything, in recent books, I've felt like she was leaning too much on the Irish thing -- which I enjoyed in the beginning -- or the marrying all the friends off to each other thing.  (Of course, it it was good enough for Shakespeare, why should we quibble when Nora Roberts does it?)  The more classic romances can get tired, where the characters are hopelessly attracted to each other and yet initially irritated by each other, yada yada. So I liked this one -- it's fun when a locale and a profession that's a little exotic is used to layer in a bit more interest. And I was grateful to be in the San Juan's, as I'm sick of cattle ranches as the settings for romances.
B002ZG980U|5.0|What are you thinking about?  Elephants, right?  You've just taken the first step into understanding the mind-influencing and reality-bending genius of Inception.<br /><br />Imagine you're dreaming an M.C. Escher painting.  You don't know up from down, don't know real from fake.  Now imagine someone else can control your dream, implant thoughts, influence your behavior, manipulate your beliefs.  First explored competently in [[ASIN:6305869103 Dreamscape]] with a young Dennis Quaid, the thought of dream control - followed closely by the real life physical, emotional, and psychological consequences of dreams - is compounded upon in level s so numerous I had to take off my shoes and socks to keep count.<br /><br />The basic concept: Cobb (DiCaprio) and Arthur (Gordon-Levitt) have the extraordinary ability to enter others' dreams - Sleeping Toms, if you will.  After an intensely realistic trial run, a rich businessman named Saito (Watanabe) enlists their abilities to accomplish the dangerous practice of \\"inception:\\"  planting thoughts into another's mind through dreams.  The target is a competing businessman, Robert Fischer, Jr. (Cillian Murphy).  What Saito doesn't know, however, is Cobb's dangerous history with time and mortality slipping away in his dreams.  Dying in dreams.  Getting stuck in dreams.  To explain all the details or dangers of their mission would be futile, but they assemble a team of various malcontents (i.e. Tom Hardy as Eames and Dileep Rao as Yusuf) and a wunderkind (i.e. Ellen Page as Ariadne - the architect) to share a perilous multi-dimensional mission into the unpredictable nether regions of the psyche, where a person's subconscious can and will attack foreign intruders like white blood cells battle disease.<br /><br />Director Christopher Nolan, who previously fried synapses with Memento and The Prestige, provides yet another wholly enjoyable, spell-binding, challenging film.  The plot and the script are fabulously complex.  There's no doubt that the Deus ex machina is heavy handed at times, but a movie intending to challenge viewers to interpret reality from dream - particularly the unknowns being explored - should be given wide latitude for explanation without ruining a viewer's exposition experiences.  In and of itself, the plot is amazing.  Paired with an outstanding cast - powered by DiCaprio, probably the best actor of his generation - that receives ample, individual screen time to strut, (great supporting roles from Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, and Marion Cotillard) and we're talking Oscar territory.  Combine all that with multiple action and special effects sequences (especially a weightless frenzy of punches, kicks, and elbows that puts a few Matrix fight scenes knee-deep in molasses) that have to be seen to be believed, and the layers form quickly (except the eye-popping slo-mo scenes) into what I'll tout as film of the year, and a round-table discussion topic for Freudian psychologists for decades to come.a is heavy handed at times, but a movie intending to challenge viewers to interpret reality from dream - particularly the unknowns being explored - should be given wide latitude for explanation without ruining a viewer's exposition experiences.

0393072231|5.0|Great Book !!!  If you're interested in learning about the financial meltdown and wondered why nobody knew it was coming you MUST read this book.  The perspective of smart people figuring out what 99.9% of the world was blind to make this a really good read.  I also liked understanding how much of the credit deservingly flows back to Michael Burry, and how he himself after amazing results was shunned by his investor group, some of which are renowned in their own right but somehow now look a little less brilliant then before.    As a partner to this book I would also highly recommend Confidence Game, a book about Bill Ackman's fight with regulators starting in 2002 to cast light on the corruption of the bond insurers, their bogus business model and their questionable if not illegal expansion into CDO / CDS securities.  This tells the story from an insiders view and provides good insight into how critical the bond insurers were to enabling the mortgage machine to expand such incredible amounts of leverage.    The Big Short is a great book!
B000F3UAFC|5.0|I loved this movie. The actors are great. The plot is not predictible. A bit of a love story. The movie flows nicely.  Super good and highly recommended. I would give it 15 stars if I could. One of my favorites.
B000SXOFL4|3.0|Ever since I heard Richard Myles' music Ambient Nights 1,2, and A Journey Home all here on Amazon, I was hooked on ambient music. Thanks to Richard. I now have Enigma and Art of Noise in my collection. This album is \\"ok\\" but no match to the first album they had. I strongly recommend the first album because it is a gem. I would recommend Art of Noise \\"Daft\\" album...just incredible music. LAst, but not least, I would recommend Ambient Nights vol 1, Ambient Nights Vol 2, and A Journey Home all done by the great Richard Myles. I just love this genre...it helps to relax me after a long day at work :). If you're seeking powerful fantasy, smooth ambient chill-out check out my recommendations. Adios Amigos!
B002VECM4A|4.0|I now understand what the hype is about.  This is a very thought provoking and brutally honest movie about a girl who was consistently raped by her father and both verbally and physically abused by her mother.  The only thing that keeps her sane throughout these horrors is to imagine herself as a Cinderella at the Ball kind of character.<br /><br />Precious is failing school but one teacher recognizes in her, an aptitude for math.  The guidence counseler recommends that Precious go to a special education school.  There Precious is treated with respect and slowly starts to come out of her shell and start to have goals for herself.<br /><br />All the while, her mother is doing her utmost to prevent Precious from learning, constantly calling her stupid and telling her she can never be anything.  Her mother is a couch potato who only cares about fooling the welfare agency to keep her check coming.  It is only until very late in the film that the audience learns why she is so bad with Precious.<br /><br />This is the type of movie that shows you no matter what the human soul endures there can always be hope even in the darkest of times.

B002JCSWV6|4.0|the acting was very good, which is to be expected with the actors in this movie. The movie does drag a bit in the middle and plays much like a biography for awhile but overall worth seeing.
1577314808|4.0|This is a convincing book from the very start with the author's  introduction re: his personal experience to explain his theories.  The writing on deeply philosophical and religious type content  is effective because of his question-and-answer method of  explaining his thesis as he moves along. The reader becomes immediately involved in finding the answers to the proposed, and  often objecting-type questions in each part of the book. I have sent the book to a relative, I am so impressed with the thoughts and concrete examples in his explication. The discussion of space, time and the \\"Unmanifested\\" e.g., may take slower reading. The book intelligently challenges a reader's beliefs and personal philosophy.
B001HN694K|5.0|I watch everything Johnny Depp is in because the characters he creates are unique and highly entertaining, though for some reason my expectations for this one were not high. The whole cast, though, is wonderful. The Hatter is one of Depp's best. Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat, Alan Rickman as Absolem, HB Carter as the Red Queen, Anne Hathaway, Timothy Spall, even Imelda Staunton is in it. And Crispin Glover was a wonderful surprise as the knave. He has the best facial scars on screen ever. The special feature showing a little bit about how the green screen work helped in the filming--I was very interested and could have watched another hour of it. I've watched this movie over and over and keep finding new things to see, details attended to. I'm glad it wasn't a remake of the original story--it was the story reimagined and tailored to the huge talents involved. Oh! And David Elsewhere. One of many nifty surprises. I love this movie.

030726999X|4.0|The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest picks up right where The Girl who Played with Fire left off. Lisbeth Salander finds herself in the hospital after being shot in the head and buried alive. I eagerly looked forward to this book the minute I learned there was a sequel to The Girl Who Played with Fire. I found that book almost superior to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Unfortunately, I thought this latest novel paled in comparison to the two previous books.<br /><br />The first two books contained most of the action that made this trilogy a sensation. The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest simply ties up loose ends. Lisbeth Salander is hospitalized for almost the entire novel. Meanwhile, Mikael Blomkvist desperately tries to prove Lisbeth was wrongfully declared mentally impaired due to a huge government cover-up involving her father, Alexander Zalachenko.<br /><br />Like the two previous books, this novel features many many characters. We meet many people in high places who were in some way or another involved with Zalachenko. The numerous characters worked well in the author's first two books, but they were just overwhelming in The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.  I read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and The Girl Who Played with Fire in a day or two, but this latest one took me almost a week to read.<br /><br />I think most readers will find the ending quite satisfying, however, don't expect the explosive action that kept you reading with bated breath in the first two books.

1579126278|5.0|I have read several of Agatha Christie's novels including: Murder on the Orient Express, And Then There were None and Murder on the Nile. Anyone who has ever read a Christie novel knows they are in for quite a treat when the book's mystery is finally solved. This ending was almost as shocking as Murder on the Orient Express!    In The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Hercule Poirot is called out from retirement after a man named Roger Ackroyd is found murdered in his own home. As in all the other books, there are numerous suspects including Captain Ralph Paton, a stepson who stood to inherit quite a bit of money. Paton's disappearance after the murder makes him the most obvious suspect in most people's eyes, but not Hercule Poirot!  He is convinced the murderer was in the home at the time of the murder. An open window, the sound of the victim arguing and the last time he was seen alive by all the suspects staying in the house give Poirot all he needs to work out the identity of the killer.    There are many clues guiding the reader to the murderer, but beware! Many are misleading!  Almost everyone in the house could have a reason for murdering Roger Ackroyd. Yet, most clues seem to point to Ralph Paton. This was a really fun read with a SHOCKING ending. Many times I thought I had figured out the identity of the murderer, in fact, at one point I was convinced I knew who did it. I was wrong!  If you have never read an Agatha Christie novel, I would start with Murder on the Orient Express, which is her best novel in my opinion. However, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd has an ending just as shocking as the latter. Fabulous mystery!
B002ZG99G8|5.0|If you want to see car chases, go watch \\"Driving Miss Daisy\\" or something. If you're into genuine cerebral action thrillers, look no further than \\"The Losers.\\" It's like an elaborate chess game. I've watched it three times now, and I keep learning new things. So hey, Breakfast of Chumpion, if you're into degenerate, unibrow trash, why don't you just quit reading this and go watch some junk like \\"The Straight Story\\"?<br /><br />To help give you an idea of the complex, \\"Inception\\"-like thinking process at play in \\"The Losers,\\" there's this one particular moment in which one of our loser-heroes shows particular brilliance:<br /><br />\\"Why don't we all tie our dog tags together and throw them into the flaming wreckage so the bad guys think we were on that chopper? That wouldn't look suspicious. Now, say something funny and pat me on the butt like we're wearing tights on the football field. Oh, yes!\\"<br />\\"Hey wait, aren't we the bad guys?\\" asks another character.<br />\\"Yeah, but we're the 'good' bad guys,\\" says the first dude.<br /><br />See what I mean? I still cry during that heart-wrenching moment when Clay sees the teddy bear burning in the wreckage of young lives turned to BBQ, young lives that were only being hustled to some other South American regime that would exploit their tenderness -- so, whatever, really.<br /><br />I've never seen a film in which the characters are so often running toward things on fire, and that's saying something because I've seen that TV movie directed by what's his name, the fruity redhead from \\"Happy Days.\\" Unlike the let's-draw-straws-for-who-drops-the-soap guys in that movie, these gentlemen genuinely love women, family comes first and they always behave properly when in attendance of their children's sports activities.
B0008ENICU|5.0|Looking at the IMDB page for this film baffles me a little.  How in the world did this film receive no awards recognition in 1939?  I mean, yes that year was a great year for film (or so we are told almost every time prestige in film is broached) but to be honest, `The Women' is one of the best films of that year; easily.  It is witty, catty, charming and wholly entertaining.  It sports a brilliant cast with rich performances and poignant emotional material.  Why in the world did this film get ignored by any and all awards bodies?<br /><br />Oh yeah, the film is about women.<br /><br />Critical prejudice against women is disturbing in film.  Even today, it is hard to get a film funded or released or recognized if it is female driven.  With a few exceptions (like that Sarah Jessica Parker phenomenon) film is generally male centric, and nearly every baity and or congratulated film (which usually results in heaps of accolades) stars a strong male lead.  I'm not saying that it DOESN'T happen, I'm just saying that history has proven it is very difficult for a film that centers around women to garner deserved respect.<br /><br />So, with my little rant out of the way I'll commence with my review of this 1939 near-masterpiece.<br /><br />I want to be clear that I have not seen the Meg Ryan remake, although I am not apposed to it.  The reviews were savage when it came to that film, and so I stayed away, but I can't say that I wasn't at least a tad bit intrigued.  Now that I have seen and digested the original I'm a tad interested to see how the remake made out with their `spin' on the concept, although I will admit that my expectations are FAR from high.<br /><br />The film centers on a group of socialites as they gossip about one another religiously, digging into the secret affairs of their so-called friends as a way to validate their own unhappiness.  When Mary, the groups sole `kind heart', finds herself at the center of a scandal involving her husband and a department store perfume girl, everything goes up in arms.  Mary is furious (as she has every right to be) but she is calmed by her mother who insists that she let the matter go.  Her friends on the other hand want her to make something of it, telling off the `girlfriend' and leaving her husband.  Soon pride takes over and Mary makes decisions in rage, not out of the comfort of a clean state of mind.<br /><br />Can she find happiness after the wake of divorce?<br /><br />Instead of playing coy, the film really tackles the weight of adultery with a sharp tongue.  Some may balk at the ending or state that it plays up the man's affairs too lightly, but I think there is much to be said about circumstance and forgiveness here.  Having been through a similar situation in my own home life, I can sympathize with the decisions and emotions felt by Mary, and I actually appreciate the films way of allowing her to vent but them `come to her senses' in a way.<br /><br />The film is sharply written and directed to develop its characters with multiple layers, giving the audience ample reasons to love and hate them.  We see their faults as well as their soft spots, and we begin to understand their motives and their actions, even the seemingly heartless characters.  This was a hard task to pull off, but `The Women' does so remarkably.  What is also so wonderful about this film is that the dialog is so fresh and brilliantly delivered.  It stands on par with many of the films released today in that department.  This is a great testament to the films actresses, all of whom turn in wonderful work.  Every last supporting player pulls her weight, standouts being Lucile Watson, Mary Boland and Paulette Goddard, and Rosalind Russell is simply devilish as the `so called best friend' Sylvia.  But this film is all about two women for me, Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford.  Shearer is just simply breathtaking as the betrayed Mary.  The fear and torment is brilliantly constructed all over her face.  While I loved her character arc in the end, I didn't find her mischievous center as convincing as her tortured one, but I still loved her.  Crawford is genius here.  She is deliciously evil, not a sour note in her star turn.  I am not the biggest Joan Crawford fan either.  I find her (normally) largely overrated, but this is a spectacular turn from her.<br /><br />Chew it up and spit it out.<br /><br />In the end, this is a brilliant film.  I am totally in love with it, and guess what; there is not a single MAN in this film...not one!vous center as convincing as her tortured one, but I still loved her.  Crawford is genius here.

B0031R5K72|5.0|One of the most uniquely written books I've read. Captivating, sweeping, and breathtaking. This is one of those beautifully told stories that is spellbinding and you close the book a little bit better than you were before (at least that's my opinion anyway) To account only five stars to The Book Thief feels like an insult. I'd give it far more if Amazon would give me the option. Must have this book!
B000CNESU8|5.0|This is the most important movie you've never heard of.    The screenplay goes down as the greatest of all time.  Not only does it balance humor with sincerity, but it pierces the conscience of every American watching.  Because of the information within this movie, I still don't know how it ever got produced or distributed.  I don't know if it would be possible today with the grip the oil banks have over Hollywood now.  With it's commentary on television, news, oil, banks and money; it's unbelievably applicable today though it was made 34yrs ago.      This was also the 2nd movie ever to win 3 Awards for Acting and they had 5 nominations total.      This movie is a call for the American people to Wake-up from their apathy and take their country back.  But it convinces you in a way that will leave you laughing on the floor one minute and with a not in your throat the next.
B000FJGWBC|3.0|Jessica Alba cannot act, but she looks good here in her bikini, all sweaty while fighting off any number of muscular evil drug dealers while narrowly avoiding being constantly eaten by sharks. There is little in this action adventure that is remotely credible, as if it is that easy to take a blower into the sea and blow off the sand from a 150 year old wreck full of gold. Whatever. And the annoying lawyer brother of the male lead needs to be slapped throughout. You won't learn anything from this, but the constant underwater photography is stunning.

B00003CX8N|4.0|84 Charing Cross Road is based on a play/book written by Helen Hanff about her correspondence with Frank Doel, chief buyer of Marks & Co, antiquarian booksellers which was located at 84 Charing Cross Road.  Helen write to Marks & co. to purchase old, classical books that she was unable to purchase in New York and maintained this contact with Frank and other members of the book selling staff.  This correspondence evolved into friendship as she exchanged gifts and real discussions about a variety of topics.    I enjoyed this quiet and unassuming movie.  However, it was hard for me to stop comparing it to The Shadowlands as both star Anthony Hopkins as a quiet English man who enjoys literature.  This comparison did tinge my views of the film.    Anne Bancroft stars as Helen and Hopkins stars as Frank.  The movie plays with perceptions of American versus English interactions and stereotypes.  Frank is a reserved man to Helen's very vocal woman, but the viewer sees a real connection made.  Hopkins excels at subtle acting and it's amazing to see how he can make such a quiet character so empathetic to the viewer.    This film is not groundbreaking, but enjoyable in a subdued and thoughtful manner.
B00386OWUC|5.0|Michael Haneke, Europe's preeminent film director, was born in Munich in 1942 and currently teaches at the Vienna Film Academy. He has made films in French, German and English. The White Ribbon marks a return to his native country with a beautiful black and white film that shows Northern Germany just before World War I. This was the generation that espoused a totalitarian philosophy that led to the rise of Naziism.<br />In The White Ribbon, Haneke focuses on the abuse of children by the Christian religious leaders of the time. The white ribbon was used to tie the hands of young boys to prevent them from masturbating. We see many cases of child abuse in the film and the use of severe discipline. Haneke refuses to tie a neat bow around the film. We see what happens and we have to make our own conclusions.<br />The blu-ray has many special features with interviews of the director and others who made the film as well as a short film showing the awarding of the 2009 PALME D'OR at the Cannes Film Festival, Europe's most prestigious award.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|This 2008 movie by Studio Ghibli (Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle) was directed and written by Hayao Miyazaki and is loosely based on The Little Mermaid.  The story follows a little fish-girl, Ponyo, that runs away from her father and wants to turn into a human and be with a little 5-year old boy, Ssuke, that she meets.  The story ensues as Ponyo attempts to become human and threatens the environmental balance of the world.    I had high expectations for this movie as I fell in love with Spirited Away and Miyazaki did not disappoint me.  I have never seen 2d animation that can compare to the quality in Miyazaki's movies.  Ponyo takes it to a completely new level with the style and scope of animation.  The detail of the water, colors, and fish is artistic and majestic to say the least.  Animation aside, the story and plot of this movie keep you enthralled and excited to see what happens next.  I think it's a good recommendation for an animated movie that draws you into the plot and characters so much that you forget it's animated.  Ponyo and he friend seem so alive that it was easy to become immersed in the story.    The only portion to disappoint me in this movie was the last song during the ending credits.  I thought the music throughout the story was lilting and pretty like what I was watching and then this last \\"theme\\" song comes on at the end of the credits like a childish and obnoxious TV show.    That being said, I loved this movie and highly suggest you see it.

The only thing that should be LOST is the awful conclusion.
B00000JSJC|5.0|One of the best films of the 1990s, and -far- ahead of its time. The action is incredible.

The music and soundtrack are some of the strongest of the era.

B002ZG981E|5.0|\\"Inception\\" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: Dom Cobb is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction, stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state when the mind is at its most vulnerable. Cobb's rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible -- inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have seen coming.    The cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio (in an impressive performance as Cobb), Ken Watanabe (as Saito), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (as Arthur), Marion Cotillard (as Mal), Ellen Page (as Ariadne), Tom Hardy (as Eames), Cillian Murphy (as Robert Fischer, Jr.), Tom Berenger (as Browning) & Michael Caine (as Miles) is brilliant!

This is a brilliant and intriguing thrill-ride that keeps you on the edge of your seat and thinking at the same time, all the time. This is smart, entertaining, and fun.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|solid knife bought one for me and one for my brother, at this price i dont see how you can beat it. one thing neg. o will say is the snap that holds the handle isnt the best and is to tight. i bet there is a really good way to hold that handle down that would make it the perfect sheath.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is a great Madonna album.  So many songs are fantastic. Favorite songs are: Hung Up, Get Together, Let It Will Be, Forbidden Love, Jump, Isaac, Push and Like it or Not (9 out of 12!) But in reality, I think all the songs are good.      I don't think it gets enough credit.      She is the QUEEN!!!
0321344758|5.0|If you ever wanted to reach into your computer screen and throttle the jerk who made that annoying website, the author does it for you. Very helpful in thinking about the design of my websites.<br />I still find testing hard to implement and suspect others will too. But for general principles, this book nails it.
B002ZFQD04|5.0|I saw this concert in Los Angeles and was blown away by the refreshed versions of classic songs.  As my seats were far from the stage (Dodger Stadium) I didn't get to see details (tickets were $160 but worth every penny.) I was praying she would release this as a full length DVD (I saw her Re-Invention tour years earlier and was so disappointed she didn't release the full show on DVD.)     While this show isn't quite as theatrical as her past shows, she doesn't disappoint. I LOVE the new versions of old classics.  Nothing \\"tired\\" or \\"old\\" about it. Music 2008, La Isla Bonita 2008, and especially Like a Prayer 2008 and Vogue 2008 are, in my opinion, fantastic.  In fact, I love that she sang so many classic songs at this concert (which is good because although I am a life-long Madonna fan, I didn't really go crazy for \\"Hard Candy\\".)    The only thing that could have made it better would have been if the guest appearances by Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears was shown. Hearing the crowd go nuts when they appeared on the stage gave me goose bumps!    The added Bonus Features are great too. It's always cool to get a sneak peak at the behind the scenes action and and to see what incredible work goes into preparing for one of Madonna's elaborate shows. And having the live cd is fantastic.    If you didn't get to see the live show then don't miss out, buy the DVD/CD.  And even if you did see the live show, buy it anyway so you can re-live the experience.  I will never forget the moment the crowd cheered and went wild when the newly elected Obama's face came up on the big screen (not featured in this version of the show) Nor will I forget the nearly 3 hours (normally a 20 minute drive from where I was) it took to get to the show, because of the gay and lesbian rights protest going on in Hollywood that night.     A fun, lively and fresh concert!
B001NESPHC|5.0|I just stumbled upon this album while browsing cds on Amazon.  I could tell just by listening to the little sound clips that this was going to be an amazing album.  It is so calming. Her voice is beautiful and wraps you up in warmth.     My friend heard just one song of hers (Worrisome Heart) off my ipod playlist and she went instantly crazy, immediately purchasing the album.     Frankly, I don't even like jazz much, but I love this album.
B0013N3DSE|5.0|I have always loved this film and have watched it over the years on Television, VHS and DVD. I must admit I was a bit skeptical on a Blue Ray transfer of a film this old. The price was reasonable so I decided to give it a go. I was not disappointed. The film started off a little grainy during the credits but from the opening scenes the clarity and especially the colours were magnificent. I cannot recommend this film highly enough to anyone who loves the old swashbuckling classics and who better to deliver this; of course Errol Flynn. This Blue Ray is also Region Free and can be viewed on any Blue Ray player.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|The first time I hear the song \\"The Story\\" (it was a free single of the week off itunes) I instantly said, \\"Whoa, who IS THIS???\\" It quickly became my favorite song of all time!     I quickly purchased the album and was not disappointed. Rather I fell in love. This album is my favorite of her three at this point (and I do love all three.) If you buy this album first, you will undoubtably fall in love with her voice, lyrics and melodies.  If you already love Brandi then RUN, don't walk to buy this album.     This album propelled Brandi to the top of my favorite singers list.  She even tops Sarah McLachlan for me now, and that is saying A LOT.       Definitely buy this album.
B00004RFFS|4.0|I bought this movie also for my Daughter as she requested. I like the two stars acting ability. In this yester year fantasy you could see the conflict of emotions. I did feel that there was alot more that could have been done with the story without all the bloody details. After all everyone knows what vampires do.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|I am a life-long Madonna fan (loved her at hearing her first song Borderline over 25 years ago!) so I was going to buy this release no matter what. At first I was a little disappointed that there weren't more \\"old classics\\" but when I watched it a second time I realized how amazing this concert was.  Not quite as theatrical as her past shows: The Blonde Ambition Tour, Re-invention or The Drowned World Tour. But you can really focus on the music.    When I first heard the album that she was promoting with this tour, (Confessions on a Dance Floor) I didn't get hooked right away. But after watching this DVD a few times (and by now I've watched it a lot more than a \\"few\\" times!) I realized how amazing that album really is. And now it's one of my favorite Madonna Albums.     Having the added bonus of the cd is great and seeing the behind the scenes look at the rehearsals is priceless.     She is still the QUEEN!!!
B000G6BM00|4.0|I bought the movie for my Daughter.It ok,my taste in movies has changed. I would not recommend it for younger children.There are way too many bloody scenes.
B000002TQB|3.0|A sometimes fun strain of dancier Brit alternative from the early nineties movement cannot live up to lofty praise.
0743455967|1.0|I bought this book, because I decided that a writer who has made millions from the art must know something about it.   What advice do I get? 'Buy Strunk & White's Elements of style' (I have had a copy for years, for all the good it does me.)     King tells us: Never write with our thoughts on the money we could make; he never writes a word with that in mind. Really? Oh come on! You are a professional writer for God's sake! Why else would anyone sit for hours at a keyboard (or at a writing-slope, if you are so disposed) just to write fiction to read for a hobby? (Remember Dr. Samuel Johnson?  He said, \\"No man but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money.\\"   Despite his claims that he never wrote for money, I think the money won out with Stephen King,    Of course he wrote for money. Writing was his talent, his way out of poverty. Likewise, J K Rowling freely admits why she wrote the Potter books. Lee Child too is honest about it. He was out of work, so he had to write.     I was never a die-hard fan of King's, but I have read a good many of his books, right from when he started. From the word go, I was struck by the similarity of his work to that of other, much better writers. You older readers know the authors I refer to. We are also told that we stand little chance of becoming great writers unless we are geniuses. I can't agree with that. If you are interested in writing, you must have an innate talent for it. If you are serious about writing you write, and you get better at it.        So if you want to read books that might improve your writing, see what Jack Bickham had to say on the subject. At least he is honest and admits that you want to sell your work. He also said the same as King. If you want to become good; good enough to sell, you have to sit down and write. There's no substitute. But at least he inspires you to do it, rather than hoping you keep out of his field!
0316067601|4.0|This book has a fast hertbeating sequence of facts that decided about three Navy Seals' fate and the consequent fight for life for the author.    Great reading in a short time.
9889979942|4.0|Having lived and worked and China, as well as having traveled extensively here, the content of Tom Carter's photography is always familiar to me.  However, his photos are always strikingly fresh, a new lens cast on everyday people across China.  In the pages of his book, Tom tells story after story by capturing a glance or a smile from individuals among China's billion citizens.    I am a Chinese teacher, and I use this book to introduce my students to the idea that what they think of as \\"Chinese\\" is far narrower than the reality of who the people of China are.  It is a captivating portrait of modern Chinese citizens both for those who have recently taken an interest in the country and avid China watchers alike.
B003HARV3Y|2.0|In referrence to the first review the items listed were missed, unfortunately so were most of the suppporting characters, the back stories, the theme and any character building.  The movie, although 2 hours long, seems rushed and sloppy even though the effects were great as would be expected with computer generated effects. The actors did a somewhat respectable job with their roles as defined by the script but at times Logan Lermans acting was lacking.<br /><br />I am sorry I spent a dollar renting this film.<br /><br />Stick with the books.
0142427861|5.0|Stephen King's ROADWORK enjoys G. Valmont Thomas' fine voice and associations with the same festival as it tells of Bart, whose home lies in the path of progress. His intention to make a 'last hurrah' before the city paves his past will have lasting results in this fine thriller.
B000UOOT1W|5.0|For casual fans of Santana as I was this CD of great songs from Santana will blow you away.  The musical genius of Santana is on each song of this fantastic CD collection of what is aptly titled ULTIMATE SANTANA.
0142428213|5.0|RUNNING MAN receives a fine narration by Kevin Kenerly, whose longtime association with the Oregon Shakespeare Festival and acting background lends drama to this story of an unemployed man with a sick baby who can't afford a doctor. His decision to become a contestant on a Network Game that's a live-or-die win situation makes for a gripping saga.
B000ZJTPLG|5.0|I play punk like Green Day. This married with my SSS strat make the perfect tone for any punk, alternative, Classic rock or cleans. If you play humbuckers you can get a much heavier more suitable for metal, but I really don't care for playing metal.It is very versatile with the gain and tone dial. it lso make a good preamp for a bigger amp and will transfer it amazing tone. I eould have to say this is one of the best sounding amps I've heard. (I've played fenders and high end marshalls.) This is the best 40.00 I've ever spent a small amp. Another useful feature is that it take AAA batteries and not 9 volts; AAA's are more common, less expensive and have better rechargeable batteries. THis is probably what I'll stick with for the rest of my life.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|i bought this for a friend for christmas and she was happy. This is one of the best batman movies i have ever seen the acting is great and the plot is amazing. I would recommend buying this movie.
B00280LYHS|4.0|Great action packed finale to the series...I thought it could have ended a few chapters earlier though.
B00004XOWM|4.0|this is a great cd if you like a mix of rap and metal. You have to not mind listening to swearing though because there is a lot in this cd. I really like them and the reason i bought this was because one of my friends borrowed my first one and scratched it to hell.
044024367X|4.0|I was concerned about the low star ratings, but I really enjoyed the book.  I think some of the lower ratings may be due to political orientation. I think that while Reacher always wins, there is a refreshing amount of story change from book to book, and that keeps me coming back for more.
0143039431|2.0|I generally like early Steinbeck but this book is irritating to read.<br /><br />Every poor person is all good every rich California land owner all bad.<br /><br />All the Okies need is a spark for Bolshevism to ignite on and on and on....<br /><br />East of Eden and other of his works where Steinbeck remains a fly on the wall observer and non political are so much better don't waste your time on this.
B003JSU2NU|5.0|This soundtrack definitely meets the quality of the previous two films and their soundtracks! I would definitely recommend it to any Twilight fan.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Best movie of the decade- haters analyzed!  OK, so I won't get into the plot again. Suffice it to say that there will always be haters of this masterpiece, just like there will always be haters of &#34;2001, A Space Odyssey&#34;, and others of its ilk. Why? Because some people just want to be entertained, and be spoon-fed a story that they don't have to put any effort into understanding. They tend to get angry about things that they can't understand easily. Not that there's anything wrong with that.  Yes, this movie is just about impossible to fully understand, or put together, on the first viewing (unless you read about it ahead of time, and that really does take away all the fun). The story is not told in a linear fashion. This is rendered further complex because you don't realize the extent of this until the movie is over. Not that the ending explains anything, like, for example, it does in &#34;The Sixth Sense&#34;.  You have to put it together. Yes, when I saw it the first time it was a total mind screw that I did not understand. But, it was so compelling that I simply had to figure it out. So, after reading reviews, discussions with others, and rewatching, I began to see it clearly. The more times I watched it (over a period of time) the more its magnificence (yes, magnificence) unraveled in a way that was absolutely mesmerizing! If you were a fan of the TV show &#34;Lost&#34;, and tend to like stories that you have to put in mental effort to figure out, then this is the film for you. It is innovative, rich, powerful, emotional, intense, stark, erotic, and so incredibly sad. Naomi Watts- phenomenal in what is ultimately revealed to be an extremely complex and difficult role to play. The beauty of this film is in the unique way that it will ultimately unravel for you, bit by bit.  Kind of like a classicist looking at modern art for the first time, and simply dismissing it as stupid- that is who the haters are, and I get that.  But to me, the fact that Lynch's mind came up with such a fascinating and completely different way of telling a story is what gives the movie its true value. It made most critics lists of the top 10 films of the decade (2000-2010) and deservedly so. But if you are the kind who simply wants to have a story told to you without having to put in any of yourself, don't bother, you won't like it. Not a judgement; simply a fact.
B0036RPM8E|2.0|Audio it's not good enough. Don't even try to listen in 5.1 \\"true HD\\", very poor quality (Had to play it in PCM stereo). On the other hand, the band is superb. Sambora is magnificent. It's a great concert, but the sound's not.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|I was very happy with this set.  The season one I ordered came with two disc 2's but no disc 1.  That was disappointing b/c I can't start my collection from the beginning.  This one, however, was in perfect condition.  I've watched them all and haven't had a problem.  Good purchase!
0515141429|5.0|My first Lee Child book, Jack Reacher a jobless man, ex army, with no real purpose for the time being travels throughout the country. He has the misfortune to get off his bus close to Margrave, Georgia where he is arrested and accused of murder.    Jack Reacher finds himself in jail for a few days with another strange man he does not know. Soon enough, he is out and the Detective who leads the investigation also seems convinced of the mistake and of Reacher's innonence, yet he is kept under his eye for a short while as he is useful for the investigation (due to being in the prison cell with a man who may have held crucial information, who can not be found).    Reacher does not really care about the investigation and is ready to leave town, until he learns that the murdered person is his brother, he then becomes a obsessed in solving the case and works with the Detective and officer Roscoe to solve the riddle behind the murder.    As you read through the book, Reacher realises there is a lot of non sense going in the town of Margrave, from Counterfeit money to corrupted Police department, as the investigation is led even Reacher and the Detective no longer really understand who is clean and the logic behind murders which seem to grow in number.    Very interesting, and great read.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Excellent - if you can carve out a day to watch the movies back-to-back.  The movies were well done and time was taken to really tell the story.  I enjoyed it immensely and feel these are the greatest movies of all time.
0307474712|5.0|Dexter and Emma meet the night before graduation, the night before their lives will take dramatically different paths, but they form a strong connection nonetheless.  One Day tells the story of their growing, changing relationship from July 15, 1988 to July 15, 2008.  The ups and downs are funny, sweet, and heart-wrenching.  David Nicholls creates wonderful characters to empathize with and cheer for.  The style of the novel, telling of Dex and Em's lives one day, one year at a time, makes it a quick read, but with a lot packed in.  A great novel that will surely make a great film.
B0035KGWR2|2.0|I think I was the 1st person to give her a fiver for her 1st-THIS IS THE THANKS I GET!  This is going to make more money?  What happened?  Boom-boom, not enough of that-crappy pop ? album.  My search continues.
B0037QGS0A|4.0|The lovely Amanda Seyfried is CHLOE, a prostitute hired by the eminent New York City Ob/Gyn Dr. Catherine Stewart (Julianne Moore) in order to \\"test\\" her husband David (Liam Neeson), a prominent Professor of Music, whom she suspects of having affairs.<br /><br />Dr. Stewart, although professionally successful in a spectacular way and endowed with material success, intelligence, and her own beauty, suffers from a deplorable lack of self-esteem. Closing in on 50, she feels she has lost her attractiveness even while Professor Stewart becomes more distinguished and desirable to women, with whom he flirts shamelessly.<br /><br />Having completely alienated her teenaged, newly sexually active son by her constant invasive eavesdropping, she begins to erode her marriage similarly, reading her husband's emails and checking his call lists. Although there's little enough to go on, she convinces herself of David's infidelity, and hires Chloe as a trapdoor spider to attempt a seduction.<br /><br />Chloe begins to report back to Dr. Stewart regularly in a slowly escalating series of erotic tales regarding her husband. Despite herself, Dr. Stewart becomes sexually enthralled by Chloe's ongoing seduction, losing herself in detailed fantasies regarding Chloe and the Professor. This culminates in the good doctor having a sexual liaison with Chloe. Their lovemaking sequence is easily one of the most erotic and near-explicit such scenes ever crafted in mainstream filmmaking.<br /><br />Afterward, Dr. Stewart confronts her husband regarding Chloe. The denoument is predictable; the film's end is so contrived as to nearly utterly spoil this otherwise engaging film. Were it not for the last three minutes this would be a perfect film. The performances are excellent, especially Neeson's and Seyfried's; Moore's is a shade less so, if only because her rampant insecurity seems so implausible.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B001AQO3QA|5.0|After the Lord Of The Rings fiasco it looks like they got it right! Putting bother versions of all four films all at once was the smart move! No double dipping here!<br /><br />I have owned all of these movies in previous sets and they are pretty damn good. Obviously 1 & 2 are the best. Alien 3 is good, but maybe a little too dark. 4 was interesting as it was Joss Whedon's first incarnation of what seemed to be the crew of \\"Firefly\\". The plot was definitely not all there, but it had some good moments.<br /><br />Overall this set will be a fantastic blu-ray event! Get your popcorn ready cause it's gonna get crazy!
0399156577|5.0|Nora Roberts came through again with another fantastic book.  I have not been overjoyed with the last couple of her books; but this one brought her back to the forefront of my favorite authors.  I simply couldn't put it down.  In fact, I stayed up all night just to read it!
030726999X|5.0|A must read but read all three books in order to get the full story.  I only hope they are able to finish his fourth book.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I didn't weigh myself at the start of the Shred but reckon I stood at 90kg.<br /><br />This is my second go at the Shred. I quit the first time to protect my knees (thinking I would first shift some kilos using Slim in Six and then attempt it again). This time round I have decided to not give up unless my knees give out. I plan to do it five or six days a week; two weeks per level. I'm adding Leslie Sansone walks (so that I don't have to diet), 10 Minute Solution ab workouts and plenty of stretching.<br /><br />As for my diet, I don't really deny myself, but I like healthy food, so I think I eat well most of the time.<br /><br />WEEK ONE: A week ago, my waistline measured 36.5\\" and hips about 50\\". I was thrilled to see my waistline shrink to 35.5\\" and hips 49.75\\". When I did Slim in Six --- I lasted four weeks on that --- I was losing a half inch a week so losing an inch is a huge accomplishment, and in only five days.<br /><br />WEEK TWO: Waist - 34\\" (I'm stunned!)  Hips - 49\\"<br />Instead of adding two miles this week I did three, and on Wednesday actually interval trained with [[ASIN:B002MY53QI Leslie Sansone's 5K with a Twist]]! I had my last chance workout yesterday (Saturday) which comprised of a 5-min warm-up and then 10 minutes of abs, Level One and Leslie's Three Fast Miles. Last Saturday I was dying using a two-mile. I hoped I could do three a week later with gusto but I was still dying! However, my performance has definitely improved and whereas I can't move up to Level Two just yet I'm almost ready to keep up with the girls (I follow both, depending on the move itself).<br /><br />PS: My knees are doing much better than when I started; I'm glad I didn't use them as my excuse to not Shred.<br /><br />PPS: Last week I was ecstatic to not see my belly while standing and looking down my sports bra. Today I can't see it peeping through my T-shirt! Yay!<br /><br />WEEK THREE: Waist - 34\\"  Hips - 49\\"<br />Alas! It's been sooo cold this week. I did the Shred four times, abs and three miles twice, two miles once and little stretching. I had a cream doughnut and carrot cake (on separate days!). I weighed myself yesterday (Saturday) and was well over 90kg! I want to believe I've gained muscle and maybe water (I take Glucosamine for the knees and have read it increases water retention) but I am a little disappointed that I'm so heavy.<br /><br />Nevertheless, good things happened this week: I fit into a UK 14 shirt, and my workout shorts began to ride up and down my waist. I'm STILL on my way to being shredded!<br /><br />WEEK FOUR, FIVE, SIX... I LOST COUNT: Waist - 33\\" Hips - 48\\"<br /><br />The struggle continues. I'm happy to have managed to shave off another inch although I've not exercised consistently. This slump is nothing new. My body typically rebels a month into a weight loss programme; cravings kick in and death row is more enticing than exercise. I'm trying to motivate myself with the memory of how good I felt after working out and on Sundays when I measured myself. Jillian once said via podcast that when the slump happens, one should give oneself permission to take a break. Although her slump lasted seven days and here I am, several weeks later, still slumped.<br /><br />UPDATE: I give up. Kinda. I have now progressed to Level Two, albeit never mastering Level One, because I hoped that the novelty would keep me going. But Level Two is just so hard that I've decided to stick to Level One and add other DVDs to make a rotation. Maybe I'll try all three levels some time in 2011... and I'm STILL on my way to being shredded!<br /><br />UPDATE, JANUARY 2013: I did it! I finally did all three levels of the 30 Day Shred! I only barely mastered Level One, but I'm happy with my performance on all levels because I did things I never thought I could do! I am still very heavy, about 95kg, so I'm positive that the lighter I become, the better I will perform.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I only lost 2kg in the four months I Shredded, and I'm still wearing my regular clothes. I was hoping to be much further along. This time my diet was not good: too many carbs, not enough protein. I've only just corrected my diet, but after four months of the Shred, I've moved on. I still recommend this workout because it does work you out and improve fitness. I believe my results were atypical.
0140437681|5.0|Treasure Island is one of those books that is thought of as a boy's book, a classic that nonetheless is designed for the youth that craves adventure. As such, it delivers, but that is not the only reason one should read this classic. The appeal is present for the fully grown man, if not woman. In fact, there is hardly a woman character in the novel, and though Robert Louis Stevenson had contributions from others in the writing of it, women were conspicuously absent in the influence, contributions primarily coming from his stepson and his father.<br /><br />It is evident from the novel that Stevenson's description of the landscape does not mesh well with something from the Caribbean, but possibly something from California (which he visited -- in pursuit of a certain married woman, which he later married himself), with the inclusion of trees that can only be described as Redwoods. He does not really say where the island lies, in any case. The story goes that Stevenson drew the island first, then the story was developed later, influenced by other stories by such as Washington Irving.<br /><br />This is an adventure that is a beautiful version of escapist literature from an imaginative writer, and though Stevenson was obviously influenced by others, his tale has influenced more modern tales, such as \\"Pirates of the Caribbean,\\" theme song and all. I think women may enjoy the tale, as well, but on the whole, this is a story for boys and men, especially ones in search of a worthy adventure of the mind.<br /><br />As a little quibble, on page 179, I noticed a place in the Penguin paperback version where it says \\"tail trees\\" rather than \\"tall trees,\\" and it was not simply a printing imperfection, but an outright error. Still, the Penguin version has many extras...an introduction by a scholar, an essay at the end by Stevenson on the writing of the book, and a section from Washington Irving's \\"Tales of a Traveller,\\" which influenced the beginning of \\"Treasure Island.\\"
B002QW7AJY|5.0|I'm not going to write a big long review explaining every scene in the movie because it would be full of spoilers and I just don't want to take the time to do it. BUT, I have to say this movie is awesome! I'm a pretty big sci-fi fan and a pretty big horror fan and this movie is both. I personally didn't like Event Horizon, however that's about the only other movie I have seen in this genre. Aliens too I guess, but aliens was more a sci-fi thriller in my opinion and not really a horror movie per say, but I guess that's a matter of opinion.     Anyway, Pandorum is epic. I saw the preview and thought it looked good especially since it was rated R, which I usually take as a good thing with horror movies because it leads me to believe they weren't watered down. This movie was definitely NOT watered down at all. Sadly I missed it while it was in theatres which is usually the case for me because I don't go to the movies much. The only real turn off I had going in was Dennis Quad. I'm not saying he's a bad actor but sometimes he just doesn't do it for me. Man was I eating my opinion of him with this movie. He was great, hands down the best performance I have ever seen him give. He's usually too dry and boring for my taste even in The Day After Tomarrow he just wasn't that great, though not unbearable. But man he gave Pandorum everything he had apparently. So hats off to Dennis for not only giving me a huge reason to like him now but for also not making Pandorum suck (I really mean that in a good way). All the other actors were terrific too, no poor performances in this film, everyone did a good job and played their roles very believably.     Now for the story all I want to say is if you are the type likes twists and psychological thrillers you will love Pandorum. I really don't want to give anything away or over hype anything but its got some real surprises you won't see coming. Horror fans will also love this movie because its creepy as hell, but real creepy not some stupid load noise to make you jump I mean full on claustrophobic feeling, scary ass tension that will make you start preying for the characters because you don't want them to get killed. Luckily this is a movie that makes you care about the lead characters. There's no one in the movie you're gunna be hoping gets his or her head ripped off, and thats what makes it great. You feel for the chars and really want them all to survive.    In the end Pandorum has become one of my all time favorite movies and definitely one of my top 10 sci-fi movies. I would rate it number 1 but I can't give that slot to any movie so all my favs jus go in my top 10 list, I think there's about 30 of em now :P    I can't recommend this one enough if there's any part of you that wants to see it jus buy it, at $11.99 for the blu-ray you won't regret it at all.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|Legend of the Seeker is the newest fantasy action series to hit the screen. I have to say this is the best and worthy successor of Xena, I know you think it is not the same as Xena the answer is true but it is a worthy effort from the same people who brought Xena and executive producer of Star Trek Voyager.

B003GDYN24|5.0|For years now, R&B chanteuse Kelis has been releasing innovative, emotive singles and albums, a large majority of which, sadly, have been sorely underappreciated (at least in the United States). This is a marvel, given what freshness she brings to just about any genre she works with. Even her most successful U.S. singles, \\"Milkshake\\" and \\"Bossy,\\" which catered to a much more mainstream crowd and were generally more mindless and less ambitious than the vast majority of her work, had a bewitching, skittering bite to them. With `Flesh Tone,' her fourth U.S. album and fifth internationally, she delves even deeper into the electronica she'd previously dabbled with in work with the likes of Moby and Richard X. `Flesh Tone' is a surging, pulsating blend of trance, house, dance-pop and heavy electronica from start to finish, and not so startlingly, given her previous track record of creative successes, it works.     What really makes it a standout in her discography, however, is that like Madonna's `Confessions on a Dancefloor,' the dizzying dance beats are accompanied by expressive, contemplative lyrics. The decidedly desolate intro has Kelis lamenting, `You draw me in/every time I think I'm free you win/your force so dark now my life feels uninspired/I heard the signs but now everything is quiet/the pain's so vicious but it must be that I like it.' The rest of the album isn't nearly as bleak, but melancholy is always expressed beautifully on a Kelis album (\\"Get Along With You\\" remains one of her brightest moments), so it meshes perfectly with the more blissful moments regardless. The words \\"we control the dancefloor\\" segue the intro into \\"22nd Century,\\" a pounding and futuristic yet simple filtered bassline tune.     The `Segues' that filter the songs into one another throughout the album are made up of several swirling, vocal-free electronic beats, a few of which, although oftentimes blending into the mood of the following track, deserved to be entire songs of their own(the bombastic Segue 2 in particular). The Moby-esque \\"Fireworks (4th Of July),\\" the album's second single, has Kelis proclaiming \\"nothing I ever say or do will ever be as good as loving you,\\" along to a synthy piano sample. \\"Home,\\" by far one of the album's best tracks featuring a transcendent, trance-y chorus, seems custom-made for endless nights of raving.     The simple, skittering, David Guetta-produced \\"Acapella,\\" the album's lead single, opens with a beat heavily inspired by minimal techno, a sub-genre of electronica sparsely known among most mainstreamers. The instrumentation and beat grow slightly heavier as the song plays, and although this song may not click with some listeners right away, its increasingly infectious hook and sincerely heartfelt lyrics become difficult to resist. If you're feeling doubtful, stick with it anyway, because it is one of the album's biggest highlights, and one of Kelis's strongest singles.     \\"Emancipate\\" is graced with a fantastic Benny Benassi beat, but ironically, it is likely the album's weakest track. The highly repetitive, cacophonous chorus just doesn't gel, and although Kelis had the right idea with this one's concept and lyrics, it's unlikely to earn any repeat listens. \\"Brave\\" swiftly picks up the slack, however, with its dizzying surge of a beat; Kelis even manages to keep things lyrically engaging this far into the album, vulnerably providing a dissertation of her divorce from rapper Nas. The song's hard, booming beat is an intriguing contrast to the deeply personal lyrics. Ending things on a positive note is the gorgeously uplifting \\"Song For The Baby,\\" which should pretty much speak for itself. The finale makes unique use of horn and piano samples all while riding an impressively upbeat (literally and metaphorically) beat and hook.     Although the genre of pure electronica in and of itself hasn't quite taken yet here in the United States, it certainly seems to be the general direction the mainstream is headed in with pop/R&B crooners and rappers alike weaving progressively noticeable undercurrents of trance, techno and dance into several of their biggest singles. Electronic music is sometimes pigeonholed as being cold, calculated, emotionally detached music, but here Kelis has displayed what electro-pop should sound like in 2010: with `Flesh Tone,' she's crafted an electronic album with feeling. Hopefully the U.S. will come to recognize a genre-and artist-they've unjustly been neglecting.

Very clear and easy instructions for everything, and great extra tips in the back.  It's art really! I made bento lunches for the whole family for a pinic at our son's Korean culture camp, and they were a big hit- as fun to eat as they were to make.  I just love this book!

B001FB5634|5.0|I went to see this at the movie theater and do not understand why other people didn't rate this film higher. I highly recommend this film. Viggo Mortensen did an outstanding job as the father and the young son was also incredible. I cannot say enough good things about this movie. Well done!!! Be warned this movie is pretty raw and very very realistic and quite depressing toward the end. But hey, this is probably one of THE most realistic post war movies I have ever seen.
B0039TD7PY|3.0|I was really looking forward to this concert, but wound up being sorely disappointed.  Any time that you are blending an acoustic piano and an acoustic guitar, you are going to have problems with the mix.  This is because the piano is a lot louder than the guitar.  There are many areas in the video that Carol King over plays and you can't hear JT or the guitar part.  This could have been easily avoided by setting her up with an electric piano.  The mix a would have been a lot better than what this CD/DVD offers.  I was sadly disappointed.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|I will only use first party accessories when it comes to controllers so Im glad that nintendo chose to re-release this product because of Wii games like Mario Kart Wii and SSB Brawl that can use this controller instead of the classic controller or Wii remote. The quality is always good with nintendo products plus the cable is now 3 meters long VS the old 2 meter cables on the original GC controllers. My only wish is for nintendo to release this product to the rest of the world and not only in Japan so it would be cheaper and I could buy it anywhere. Amazon or whoever they may get it from imports these made in china controllers from Japan.

0061537969|5.0|I had a very difficult time rating this book. While I have many problems with the manner in which it was written: the prose is simplistic and stilted, the anthropomorphic use of a scholar/philosopher/theologian dog was a bit trite, and insertion of relatively meaningless commentary on the dog's infatuation with race car driving (which really adds very little to the story), I finally decided to give the book five stars - for its ability to reach large audiences regarding the tragic tale of what happens to good fathers and men all over the Western World - how their lives are literally destroyed by false and completely unfounded charges of sexual (and other) abuse based entirely upon the malicious attempts of young children and adults to harm others (usually as they seek to justify their own narcissistic desires).     The main character (other the dog who relates this story in the first person) Denny, is subjected to extraordinary adversity for extended periods of time; I found his reactions to be rather superficial although admirable. There are an enormous number of men, in real life, who undergo similar nightmares. Denny, unfortunately, is either one of the most self-actualized individuals ever born or his affect is severely lacking in the emotional-response department. The real pain he must have suffered was not adequately expressed. Regardless, the fact that this book has gained such popularity will hopefully draw attention to the plight of innocent fathers and their children all over the world.    In looking at some of the other (esp. negative) reviews of this book, it is disturbing to read those that trivialize the jest of this story - horrible things happen to good people who are then subjected to even greater evil by others at a time when empathy, love, and kindness are most needed.     PLOT SPOILER ALERT:     As a rule, I avoid spoilers but, in this case wish to do so (the person who gave me the book did not know about what the book was about and, having personally known others who have gone through \\"Danny's plight,\\" I will do so now just in case you are buying this book for someone else). Denny, the main human character, is falsely accused of sexually molesting a hormone laden, nefarious nymph who tries to get into the poor sleeping man's pants just days after his wife dies a horrible death and then innocently tries to return the child home through a Hellish snowstorm. He falls asleep in exhaustion and the child attacks him in his sleep and later accuses him of sexually abusing her. The girl is then aided by Denny's own narcissistic evil in-laws who want to steal his child from him. (Read the book for the details). As a result, Denny is subjected to living Hell when his child is taken from him, his wealthy in-laws then sue him for child support that leads him to financial ruin, and he loses everything - all \\"in the best interests of the child\\" (a euphemism used by our sick culture to destroy men and their children).    The reason for the above spoiler is because this scenario plays out all over the United States, everyday, to innocent children and their loving fathers. Instead of investigating and giving these innocent people due process, they are instantly destroyed without any opportunity to defend themselves  and their children are immediately stolen from them: indeed these children are harmed, abused, and even murdered. Just a few weeks ago, a Los Angeles County Department of Child and Family Services \\"Child Abuse Investigator\\" was caught by police while having sex with a 15-year-old child and arrested. The very next day, another child was MURDERED because once again LA County DCFS, REFUSED to investigate real acts of child abuse. There are been many other innocent children who have been murdered (literally) because of Los Angeles County DCFS.    A recent 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling for \\"Humphries vs. County of Los Angeles\\" describes, in horrifying detail, what happens to real children and their parents whenfalse accusations are made.  The following is the verbatim opening opinion made in the Humphries case (look it up, if need be):    \\"OPINION    \\"Appellants Craig and Wendy Humphries are living every parent's nightmare. ' Accused of abuse by a rebellious child, they were arrested, and had their other children taken away from them. ' When a doctor confirmed that the abuse charges could not be true, the state dismissed the criminal case against them. The Humphries then petitioned the criminal court, which found them \\"factually innocent\\" of the charges for which they had been arrested, and ordered the arrest records sealed and destroyed. Similarly, the juvenile court dismissed all counts of the dependency petition as \\"not true.\\"    \\"Notwithstanding the findings of two California courts that the Humphries were 'factually innocent' and the charges 'not true,' the Humphries were identified as 'substantiated' child abusers and placed on California's Child Abuse Central Index ('the CACI'), a database of known or suspected child abusers. As the Humphries quickly learned, California offers no procedure to remove their listing on the database as suspected child abusers, and thus no opportunity to clear their names. More importantly, California makes the CACI database available to a broad array of government agencies, employers, and law enforcement entities and even requires some public and private groups to consult the database before making hiring, licensing, and custody decisions.    \\"This case presents the question of whether California's maintenance of the CACI violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because identified individuals are not given a fair opportunity to challenge the allegations against them. We hold that it does.\\"    As part of the Humphries vs. County of Los Angeles case, it was revealed that HALF of all of the people (over 400,000 people) on California Child Abuse Index are INNOCENT and have been denied their Constitutional Rights to DueProcess. Again, don't believe me? Just do a simple Internet search.     If anything the author, Garth Stein, did a grave disservice by downplaying what REALLY happens to men like the character Denny in this book. While the book may make many cry, it presents a very simplistic description of what happens to so many innocent men (who, unlike Denny are divorced rather than widowed) and insufficiently fails to accurately describe the emotional turmoil they endure. Overall, the story told in \\"Art of Racing in the Rain\\" is an understatement of a very real and enormous epidemic throughout the Western World - innocent people, more often than not good fathers who LOVE their children, are falsely accused and destroyed by false allegations of child molestation by 15-year-old girls.    For those wishing to read true stories about men who are falsely accused (warning, this book WILL make you cry), read [[ASIN:1608443809 Winner Take All: A Woman Exposes the Violation of Men's Rights at the Hands of Family Law]] by Canadian author, Molly Murphy. Although Murphy, like Stien, describes the veritable tsunami of destruction caused by false accusations, Murphy's stories are true stories.     Had I known, in advance, what this book was about I would not have read it. Just the same, it tells an important story, albeit in an often trivial way. Stein's story may be fictional but it provides a horrifying glimpse at our real world.

0307454541|5.0|just buy this book -- you won't regret it. But do be prepared to be sucked into the entire trilogy. Larsson is genius -- each book in his trilogy could easily be read on its own, without reading the other two. But you WANT more.<br />Larsson also does an incredible job of making the entire package attractive to both male and female readers -- a Lothario hero and a courageous heroine, in addition to very well-developed characters of both genders. And all this with incredible, multi-layered plotlines as well.<br />While this first book at times seems to scream \\"screenplay,\\" it still is worth it -- it's an adventure you won't want to put down for a second.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I am a longtime Eminem fan who owns every one of his CDs.  Without question 'Recovery' is one of his best albums, right up there with the Marshall Mathers LP and The Eminem Show.  Virtually every track is at least decent, and the vast majority of the album is spectacular.  It's a nice mix of serious Em and crazy off-the-wall Em, with sick lyrics, mostly tight beats, and some catchy unique hooks.  Personal favorites are:  Talkin' 2 Myself, Going Through Changes, No Love, Space Bound, Almost Famous, Love the Way You Lie, You're Never Over, and the Bonus Track.  But really the whole album kicks a$$ -- a must have for any Eminem fan.

0545123283|5.0|As a big fan of Shiver, I was highly anticipating this next book in the triology. I can't help but always doubt how good a sequel is going to be - for some reason they never capture the awesomeness that you find in the first book of a series... but that is not the case here. Ms. Steifvater's Linger met my expectations, in fact, I think it is just as good, if not better than Shiver.<br /><br />Winter is almost through and Sam is still just a boy. Although he spends must of his time worrying about whether he'll change or not, he finds joy in writing his songs but, most of all, he finds happiness with Grace.<br /><br />Grace is just happy to have Sam in her life. Their risky experiment at the start of winter worked and she is no longer worried about Sam going wolfy. But her health is unexpectedly deteriorating and her notoriously absentee parents are none-too-happy with how fast her relationship with Sam is going and will stop at nothing to keep them apart. Grace is trying to keep her illness from Sam but she knows that whatever she's suffering from is very serious and if Sam is to find out she knows it will devastate him.<br /><br />Along with Sam and Grace's perspectives we also get Isabel (met previously in Shiver) and we are introduced to Cole. I absolutely loved Isabel. I looked forward to reading her POV chapters/sections. She's so sarcastic and snarky and painfully honest with her feelings. Then there was Cole - who was such a deep character. He's one of Beck's \\"new wolves\\". He chose to become a wolf because he could not fathom living his life anymore. There were so many layers to him and his pain is so honest and raw. I really liked their additional perspectives. Now I know to some thinking of reading four POV's, might sound a little disconcerting, but do not fret. Ms. Steifvater really outdid herself in giving you a different angle to every scenario in the book. I really enjoyed reading the story this way.<br /><br />Like Shiver, this book also has an emo-ish feel to it. There is not much action or adventure, but you are definitely on a roller coaster when it comes to your feelings. You are happy when reading of Sam and Grace's relationship, bitter when it comes to Isabel and Cole's lives, and mad, even bordering on hatred, when it came to Grace's parents and their constant interfering. Oh, and did I mention, Isabel's gun-crazy father, trying to shoot anything that remotely looks like a wolf.... yea, plus there's this impending sense of doom that has you on edge the whole time.<br /><br />All in all, I was enraptured by LINGER, and am positively anxious with excitement for Forever -the final installment in the Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy - scheduled to release July 2011.<br /><br />*If you are considering reading Linger, I do recommend that you read Shiver first as it is the first in the trilogy.

0786852550|4.0|This is the first fantasy type novel I have read since childhood. I really enjoyed it. It has opened my horizons and I will definitely be broadening my reading choices a lot more. The magic is very dark and I have to admit I was spooked at first. The kinds of creatures it talks about can be found in mythology and I often wondered if the author has dabbled in the occult. The descriptions were very detailed. I'm not sure it's appropriate for children, you might want to read it first before you let your child. It is very well written though and the plot was fast with a lot of action. The characters especially the boy come across as very self centered and selfish. However, it is true of everyday life, not everyone is a good person. If you are an adult looking for something different, try this. In music they have cross over artists, this is a cross over book in my opinion.

B001PJRAUS|3.0|I was excited to see this movie when I first learned about it, but after watching it I feel plagued.     While I enjoy watching the story go wrong and having to be fixed, the ending has my stomach churning. Most women wish to find someone like Mr. Darcy, however I cannot help but be upset with how BBC chose to end this. Elizabeth and Darcy are meant to be together, and I sat up thinking over and over about whether I would chose Mr. Darcy for myself if given the chance.    I have decided against it. The movie itself isn't bad, but the ending will leave P&P lovers upset. The greatest love story ever told ended up not being told..
B003IPC5SO|5.0|First of all let me start by saying that Aphrodite is a very cute title for a dance album, but would have been better suited for an album of love songs. I have this album nevertheless Kylie Minogue's eleventh studio album is a wonderful addition to anyone dance pop lover. The album that i bears a heavy resemblance to is of course her own 2000 album Light Years, she took the same winning formula and just perfected it by a decade. One would only skip tracks on here only to get to their favorite ones. All the Lovers, Everything is Beautiful, Too Much, Aphrodite, and Better Than Today are among the best of an album of great songs.
1416594787|2.0|The font is large and the actual science is thin. Couple these with the sassy and cute tone that Dawkins takes throughout the book and it's clear who the intended audience is:  the undeducated masses of conservative Christians who rarely read anything other than the Bible.  The problem is these people aren't going to read Dawkins book because it's about evolution and Dawkins is the antichrist.    Unfortunately (or is it fortunately?) I'm not in the intended audience.  So the sassy and cute tone, the large font, and the lack of hard science turned me off.  Yeah, yeah, yeah - the book provides a convincing argument - actually several convincing arguments - for evolution.  But by trying to address every facet of evolution, Dawkins has written a largely unsatisfying book for those of us who love science.  There are several better books available that cover the science of evolution in more depth.  Leave me a comment if you want recommendations.

B00004TH7Z|4.0|It's 2010 and \\"The Final Frontier\\" is about to come out, but in retrospect of the past two decades, this is the only truly good Maiden studio album since the 80's.  The album does start to fizzle after \\"Blood Brothers\\" but the first three songs are very solid.  What gets old is the continuous \\"The __________\\" titles (two of them on here).  Bruce was back and so was Adrian Smith; Maiden was too gracious to not jettison the debacle that is Janick Gers, but the return of both (not just Bruce) got Maiden back to form after their worst two albums ever.  They still haven't been able to capture the magic that made them great in the 80's, but this album is as close as it gets.
1449528279|4.0|As you'd expect from the title (which comes from John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress), Vanity Fair is social commentary.  But it is also satire and a love story.    I wanted to read this after having seen a DVD based on it.  The movie was beautifully costumed and filmed, but something seemed to be missing and I felt that I didn't fully understand the story.  I knew that reading the book would give me much more depth.    After reading it, I do feel satisfied, although as it turns out the movie actually followed the book pretty closely.  I guess it's just all the extra detail that allows a reader to know and understand the characters better.    At first glance, Vanity Fair looks like a typical Victorian morality tale in which the good guys live happily ever after and the bad guys get what they deserve.  I've heard Becky Sharp described as one of the most evil villains in all of literature.  In the movie she seemed to be more three-dimensional, rather than all bad.  I thought that was a modern touch added to make her character more believable.    But with a closer reading one sees subtle hints that Rebecca may not be totally evil.  We see how hard she has struggled for every little thing she gets, and what she is up against.  We see that her husband colluded in her behavior, or at least looked the other way during most of their marriage in order to enjoy the benefits of her schemes.  We begin to see that perhaps life - and especially other people - may have been unjust to Rebecca at least to some extent.  And especially as the story approaches its end, we see another side of her, however short-lived.    Thackeray himself seems ambiguous about his character.  Most of the time he seems to think the worst of her, but at times he seems sympathetic.  To add to the confusion, some of her supposedly shocking behavior is only vaguely hinted at, and is thus left open to the reader's interpretation.  I like this (even though it was probably done only because at the time one just didn't speak of some things in polite society, including print.)  It is fitting to Thackeray's satiric approach; it adds realism and depth; and it respects the reader's intelligence in allowing us to make our own assessment of Rebecca.  Just as in real life, we usually don't know exactly what other people have done and what their motivations were, and must try to decide for ourselves whether they are good people or not.    And it isn't just Rebecca that Thackeray is ambiguous about.  He has equally mixed feelings about Amelia.  The epitome of Victorian virtue, she is always quiet, modest, gentle, kind, obedient, loyal, forgiving, etc.  Yet at times he calls her a weak little fool.  And gradually he shows us how her unwavering loyalty to her husband might look more like obsession, stubbornness, selfishness, and pride.  Personally, I found Amelia too weak and insipid to be likeable.  Her naiveté can be excused for a while as the inevitable result of a too-sheltered life, but when it remains unchanged after decades of adulthood and life experiences, the reader questions her intelligence.      I really don't like either of them all that much.  I lean towards preferring the spirited Rebecca, but am held back by feeling that some of the things she did were unforgivable.  Even Major Dobbins isn't entirely lovable, although that is probably an artifact of 21st-century culture.  What was seen in Victorian times as a proper gentleman's duty to protect the \\"weaker sex\\" now appears controlling and disrespecting of another person's boundaries.      But I like it that I don't completely like the main characters.  They seem real:  shades of gray rather than black and white.  This is something you don't often see in 19th-century writing (for example, compare this to Anna Karenina and especially to Madame Bovary.)  As with the others, though, Rebecca is a terrible mother who is described as not just indifferent to her son, but actually hating him.  Apparently that is mandatory for female villains in Victorian literature.  But to me, it makes Rebecca less believable.  True, not all mothers are good, but the story would have been more plausible if there had at least been some struggle between Rebecca's selfishness and affection for her son, even if the selfishness won.    As I've said, Vanity Fair is satire rather than a morality play.  All satire contains elements of humor, and that's one of the delightful things about this book.  Pay attention to names in particular - they range from subtle entendré to downright silly.  There's also some great wordplay, including invented language.  It's often subtle, especially in the context of the wordy and pretentious 19th-century style of writing (and it's easily confused with obsolete vocabulary) - so watch for it.  I appreciated the immediate access to the dictionary on my Kindle!    A working knowledge of French (and to a lesser extent, German) would be helpful, as it isn't uncommon to encounter untranslated foreign phrases.  At the time this book was written, most literate British people would have been familiar with those languages.  I enjoyed the challenge, especially since sometimes these foreign phrases were garbled, ungrammatical, and misspelled (i.e., mispronunced) in order to demonstrate (and poke fun at) a poorly-educated speaker's lack of fluency.      The book did run on a little too long (another artifact of that wordy 19th-century writing.)  At times it dragged, especially during one long section about 9/10 of the way through, although it did pick up again later.  One reason for this is the way Thackeray sometimes goes off on a long tangent, describing events and characters that really have very little to do with the story, and accomplish nothing to move the plot along.  The edition I read included a commentary at the end, in which it stated that Thackeray did this intentionally, in an attempt to emulate the 18th-century style of writing that he admired more than the \\"realistic,\\" more straightforward, style popular in the 19th century during which he lived and wrote.  (This was also said to be the reason why Thackeray directly addresses the reader at times.)    But most of the time the book was interesting, and often humorous.    Thackeray's description of the game of Charades as played in the 19th century was particularly intriguing.  Newly brought over to England from France where it had been invented, it was incredibly elaborate, requiring great expense and preparation - the kind of thing you'd expect to see at the court of Marie Antoinette.  And speaking was allowed, as were musical hints, even lyrical music.  (Naturally a live orchestra was required.)    As in often the case in classic literature, there is some racism in Vanity Fair.  It is relatively rare and mild (compared to, say, Mark Twain), but could be offensive.    I would have liked to have seen the author's own drawings which illustrated the original edition (and some later ones.)  I missed out on those since they weren't included in my (Kindle) edition.  I might check the library for a copy that has them.    (699 pages)      Quotes from Vanity Fair:    \\" . . . a kiss, which was like the contact of an oyster.\\"    \\"Which of the dead are most tenderly and passionately deplored?  Those who love the survivors least, I believe.\\"    \\"What are benefits, what is constancy, or merit?  One curl of a girl's ringlet, one hair of a whisker, will turn the scale against them all in a minute.\\"    \\"She didn't wish to marry him, but she wished to keep him.  She wished to give him nothing, but that he should give her all.  It is a bargain not unfrequently levied in love.\\"    \\"It was myself I deluded and persisted in cajoling; had she been worthy of the love I gave her, she would have returned it long ago.  It was a fond mistake.  Isn't the whole course of life made up of such?  And suppose I had won her, should I not have been disenchanted the day after my victory?  Why pine, or be ashamed of my defeat?\\"
B000063DFQ|5.0|Everything that Maiden did between \\"Number\\" and \\"Somewhere\\" was amazing!  \\"Where Eagles Dare\\", \\"Revelations\\", \\"The Trooper\\", and \\"Still Life\\" are phenomenal.  \\"Sun and Steel\\" is a fantastic song that was highly underrated, while \\"Die with your Boots on\\" is probably one of the more overrated.  There is one absolute dud on this album and that's \\"Quest for Fire\\", but the strength of the rest of the album makes up for it.  The tandem of Adrian Smith and Dave Murray equate to excellent music, and Nicko comes out with guns blazing in his first album, and great work as always by Bruce and Steve.
0802473156|5.0|This definitely is a great book.  Strong Christian influence and biblical applications!  Also practical and capable of speaking to anyone at any point either before marriage or for those who are already married.
B000063DHK|5.0|Iron Maiden's \\"Live After Death\\" album and DVD are the best ever.  This is truly an amazing piece of work from start to finish.  This was Maiden at their best.  If you were fortunate enough to get the vinyl album of this masterpiece you would see how well Maiden took care of their fans with the booklet, pictures and record sleeves.
B00030DEQE|5.0|Our computer's network connection failed a few days after a big lightning storm. Once I figured out it was the network connection on the motherboard (out of warranty)I started looking for the least expensive way to get back on the network. This board was the perfect solution. I'm very happy with the ease of installation and the 1GB speed. Great value and performance!
B000063COX|4.0|The first Iron Maiden album may be considered one of their best if it wasn't for the bad sound and Paul Di'Anno's average vocals.  However, his vocals on slower songs are actually quite good like \\"Remember Tomorrow\\" and one of my favorites that is so underrated - \\"Strange World\\".  I love that song.  Most of the songs are classics, and were done a great deal of justice once Bruce did the vocals (with the exception of the aforementioned and \\"Prowler\\" which Bruce can't sing well).  \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" sounds amazing on \\"Live After Death\\" and the song \\"Iron Maiden\\" they still play at every show to this day.  The album has so many of their future hits that it watered down \\"Killers\\".  The weak spot is \\"Charlotte the Harlot\\" - I really don't care for all three of the \\"Charlotte\\" songs.  A classic album, but most songs sound better with Bruce's vocals in later live versions.
B000B589JI|5.0|This Fuel canister is one of the most ingenious yet simple things i have ever found. The naphta based fuel light fluid evaporates pretty fast and i am usualy stuck with a dead zippo, but no more! It is basically a ultra space saving zippo servicing station.<br /><br />Pros: All aluminum design is very sturdy<br />double rubber gaskets seal the canister so no fuel evaporates<br />has a flint screw tab that you can use to unscrew the flint screw, plus a flint holder<br />very portable (i attach it with my keys)<br /><br />Cons:<br />the jump ring connecting everything together, the canister, flint holder, split ring, can be pulled apart over time, i replaced with a 10mm split ring<br />Aluminum is soft, scratches a bit easy<br />the flint holder is kinda flimsy, but it shouldnt be a problem<br />the zippo logo rubs off, but that isnt too much of a bother<br /><br />Overall, a product that should be on the must have list of zippo owners.
B000063CPL|4.0|This is overall a well done live album and starts out very strong.  Bruce's vocals added to \\"Sign of the Cross\\" turn it into a great song.  However, after that Bruce screams \\"The Mercenary!!!\\" like it's one of their all time hits, which it is not.  A few rough spots in the song selection, but overall a good album.  The \\"Brave New World\\" songs sound much better live.  Whoever is saying that \\"Rock in Rio\\" is up to par with \\"Live After Death\\" needs to get their head(s) examined.
031606792X|5.0|I actually got this for a friend. Personally can't stomach the main character Bella myself, but my friend loves it so I guess it doesn't really matter. Item I ordered from amazon was received fast and looked great
B0006B29Z2|5.0|Awesome DVD and documentary!  Well done and I can phase out my \\"12 Wasted Years\\" VHS.  This is what the fans want to see!  With the release of \\"Live After Death\\" on DVD (which contains part 2 of the history), I wonder what they will do for \\"Somewhere in Time\\" and \\"Seventh Son\\".  Personally, I would love to see a lot of the \\"Somewhere on Tour\\" footage and less of \\"Seventh Son\\" with its bland, all-white stage, but I fear Maiden will hose fans on that one.  The Somewhere in Time tour had a cool stage, good props, and a great song list.  If you don't know, the inflatable Eddie comes out during \\"Iron Maiden\\" and not \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" like in the music video.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|I bought one of these to replace my old 305 which was stolen, and that in turn was a replacement for my original 205. The 205 and the 305 were brilliant devices that worked very intuitively and I was expecting the same standard with the 405.    But no.  Unlike its predecessors, the 405 is annoying, hard to use and buggy.    These are my main gripes:    1.  There is no \\"off\\" button.      Seriously, you cannot turn it off.  So if you go for a run then toss it in the drawer the battery will go flat.  The only solutions are to leave it on the charger, or plan your exercise long enough in advance to give this time to charge.    2. The screen is too small.     When I run I like to know my distance, time, speed and average speed.  The 305, with 4 data fields, was fine for this.  The 405 has only got 3 data fields of which only one is big enough to read on the go, which is not enough because;    3. The controls are completely useless.      The touch bezel is incredibly frustrating to use even when you're sitting on the couch.  Trying to use it while running is like trying to thread a needle while running.  The only way to manage it is to set the screen before you go and then don't touch it. So no scrolling through data fields on the go (and auto-scroll means you have to wait for ages to fleetingly see the data you are looking for). I've also heard that wet fabric will trigger the bezel if it comes in contact. I don't run in long sleeves but if you do it's one more thing to be wary of.    4. The backlight only stays on for 30 seconds.  If you run at night or in the mornings with such a small screen you cannot read the display without the light.  Turning it on requires touching the bezel which means you're just as likely to stop the clock or turn off the GPS as succesfully turn on the backlight.  Doing that every 30 seconds is not practical or fun.    5. The speed readout does not seem to be accurate. Sometimes when I speed up I look at the screen and it says I've slowed down, and vice versa.  It usually corrects after a minute or so but that never happened with the 305.    This is one of those rare situations where you can get a much superior product for a much lower price by just getting a 305 instead.    Hopefully the next generation will be better.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|After their resurgence on the \\"Brave New World\\" album, Iron Maiden took a few steps back.<br /><br />Wildest dreams - pretty cool song to start the album.<br /><br />Rainmaker - I don't like the intro or some of the riffs.  It's an ok song, but the repetitive lyric \\"You tell me...(this and that)\\" gets really old.<br /><br />No More Lies - The mellow intro sounds similar to half of their other newer songs.  Repetitive lyrics - can you say \\"no more lies\\"?  Ok song, solos sound good.<br /><br />Monts&eacute;gur - is ok, but a has a \\"Sherriff of Huddersfield\\" (comical Somewhere in Time b-side) sound to it that is annoying.<br /><br />Dance of Death - Another interchangeable intro with lyrics and a theme that are similar to \\"Number of the Beast\\"; however this is a recycled concept that is not nearly as effective this time.  What kind of crazy lyric is \\"And I danced and I pranced with them\\"??  That is very lame.  Has a decent riff and good solos that make the song passable.  The version on the \\"Death on the Road\\" DVD is more entertaining with Bruce's theatrics added to it.<br /><br />Gates of Tomorrow - Cheesy intro.  Doubled vocals that begin the song sound terrible.  Gets better as it goes along.  Ok.<br /><br />New Frontier - Ok.  Good bridge and pretty good chorus.<br /><br />Paschendale - A great song, the best one by far on the album, and a \\"hit\\".  Also dramatized well on the \\"Death on the Road\\" DVD.<br /><br />Face in the Sand.  Pretty good.<br /><br />Age of innocence - Ok.  Political song.<br /><br />Journeyman - mellow song.  Pretty good, but typical repetitive \\"Popeye\\"-type lyrics at the end.<br /><br />An average album throughout with the exception of \\"Paschendale\\" which is excellent.  The album cover is ok, but looks like something out of the movie \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\".  Worth a listen, but nothing significant overall.  I will give them credit for not having one \\"The ________\\" song!  Not sure what happened to the band that was so amazing and innovative in the 80's - how the mighty have fallen!  Bruce's voice has become very average and the guitar duets and interlacing harmonies are just not there.  I've never seen an iconic band have such a hard time making a good, original intro to a song and consistently throw out the formula that made them very successful in the past.  The reason why I put so much emphasis on the interchangeable mellow intros over the years is that if you are watching them live it all sounds the same until the lyrics kick in.s and interlacing harmonies are just not there.

B001F0VHEM|5.0|It's a terrific album...Clearly P!nk has come into her own and hit the bullseye as far as I'm concerned...If she continues in this direction, I'll be right there everytime to waiting to purchase the next.  If you like POP, then her beginning albums fit this billet perfectly but I'm one who loves \\"true\\" rock influenced with blues, this album has all the qualifications necessary for me to thoroughly enjoy it..
B000063DHL|5.0|Iron Maiden's \\"Somewhere in Time\\" album is one of their best.  It stands the test of time and is solid throughout.  Adrian Smith's work on this album is amazing; he is truly one of the most underrated heavy metal guitarists of all time.  \\"Caught Somewhere in Time\\" is amazing, \\"Wasted Years\\" is a classic, \\"Sea of Madness\\" is a very good and underrated song, \\"Heaven Can Wait\\" is good with a strong bridge, \\"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\\" is pretty good, \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" is awesome and has been strangely neglected from Maiden playlists after this album, \\"Deja Vu\\" is the least of the songs but has its moments, and \\"Alexander the Great\\" is fantastic.  Maiden has never played the latter live, but the all-female cover band \\"The Iron Maidens\\" play it regularly and do a great job with it (you can see it on YouTube).  Sometimes you have to see a song played live to truly appreciate it.  \\"Somewhere in Time\\" is a classic Maiden album and also has fantastic cover art by Derek Riggs.
0307592839|5.0|If you keep asking, 'And then what happened?', it is a very good book. This is a very good book.  Perhaps even better than that.    Nice work, and thank you to the author for writing a book that correctly gets the voice of my generation.
B000H7JD4A|3.0|Iron Maiden is back, but they seem to have been \\"reincarnated\\" as they are not the powerhouse they were in the 80's.  This album is an improvement to \\"Dance of Death\\" and caused a resurgence in popularity for the band, although I'm not sure what all the fuss is about.  The album is still pretty average and does not really stand out much from anything else they have done in the past two decades.  Anyone that compares this album to any of Maiden's 80's work either did not grow up then or needs to have their head(s) examined.  There are a few bright spots like \\"Reincarnation...\\" which is the best song on the album, and \\"Different World\\", \\"Brighter Than a Thousand Suns\\", \\"The Longest Day\\", \\"Out of the Shadows\\" (good medium tempo jam), and \\"Lord of Light\\" are pretty good.  The rest of the songs are ok -  \\"These Colours Don't Run\\" has garnered a lot of hype, but I don't know why - the song begins with an interchangeable intro, the vocals are below average, has an interchangeable bridge, and didn't stand out to me live either.  \\"The Pilgrim\\" (another \\"The _______\\" song) has its moments, but the vocals are pretty bad in spots. \\"For the Greater Good of God\\" has yet another mellow intro, good bridge, and lyrics seemingly of a man that is trying to accept God.  \\"The Legacy\\" starts with yet another mellow intro, the vocals are cheesy in some spots, but has some good jams.  It's no surprise that some of the weaker songs are co-written by Gers who I think just brings down the band.  There are too many interchangeable mellow intros to similar heavier rhythms; Bruce's vocals sound shot and/or whiny in some songs.  Some good stuff here, but many of their newer songs sound similar and not much really hooks me or breaks out.  They just don't sound much at all like the band that was so amazing and creative in the 80's.
0786868724|5.0|A beautiful story, beautifully written as only Mitch Albom can write.  It was a wonderful experience learning about 2 truly remarkable religious leaders.
B000063DIH|3.0|This album is a good example of Maiden's decline without Adrian Smith's creative input and how much Janick Gers sucks.  This album marks their trend of soft melodic intros to heavy tempo to soft outro.  There is not much to offer in this album - \\"Be Quick or be Dead\\" and \\"Wasting Love\\" are pretty good, and the title track is a classic.  However, that is about it - \\"Afraid to Shoot Strangers\\" contains some of the cheesiest lyrics ever, although the music is fine.
B00005MP58|5.0|this is my all time favorite movie and this is the best version of it. To me it seems to follow the book very well.
B000063DI8|3.0|This album is a good example of Maiden's decline without Adrian Smith's creative input and how much Janick Gers sucks.  This marks the era of recycled Maiden songs and the point where a song entitled \\"The _________ \\" gets really old.  \\"Tailgunner\\" should be called \\"Aces High from the back seat\\".  \\"Holy Smokes\\" is a really funny video, but belongs as a \\"B-side\\".  Most of the other songs are really worth skipping, particularly the title track which is terrible, and Bruce really has a hard time with singing softer songs (that is one thing Paul Di'Anno did well)  and his voice sounds scratchy throughout.  \\"Bring your daughter...\\" is ok, but the most underrated song on the album is \\"Mother Russia\\" which I think is fantastic although it sounds like \\"Seventh Son\\" during the bridge.
0446569895|5.0|I bought this book out of slight curiosity and ended up being addicted to it!  I couldn't put it down.  This book is well written and Ozzy's life is very interesting.  Highly recommended!!
B001W63DXC|4.0|I think the concept of this CD is strong with every song recorded in a different country.  It's about time Maiden returns to their roots - this is what the fans want to hear!!  Pretty solid throughout; I probably would have substituted \\"Moonchild\\" for something else like \\"Running Free\\" but overall a good song list.  The \\"ugly\\" is Janick Gers butchering Adrian Smith's solos which I don't understand why he is playing them anyway - Adrian wrote them.  Janick is just not technically sound, precise, and creative as Adrian Smith.  You can clearly tell when Gers is playing a solo because it sounds erratic and hardly resembles the original.  It was good to take a trip down memory lane with Maiden, although you can't ever really turn the clock back which is evident in Bruce's vocal range and aforementioned Janick Gers debacle.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|James Cameron's best work yet.  I hope there's going to be a sequel.     We saw this in the theatre but still bought a copy and have viewed it three times in the past four months.
B002UXRGM0|3.0|Like my title suggests, the videos looked awesome, but I found the informational content boring.  I feel like the narrative jumped around too much from scene to scene.  The content from the 1st disk was reused in subsequent disks, so it may be repetitive watching those sections again.  I think the most interesting parts were the behind-the-scenes clips.  Overall, I think Planet Earth was more entertaining to watch
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|the songs on this album are awful , so glad i didnt buy this garbage. only good song on this is b.y.o.b. im so glad they broken up or theyd release more crap like this. system of a downs first and second album which was toxicity was great albums. after that they just started to suck really bad.
B003A03RRU|5.0|These is a fantastic collection of all of the Sherlock Holmes stories.  I wonderful collection to read, I couldn't put it down.  It does have some historical inaccuracies but way back then they didn't have access at their finger tips as we do for research.  Overall fantastic.
1401323820|3.0|I quite enjoyed reading about Nikki Heat after totally enjoying Castle on TV. The characters are 'live' and the mystery that needed solving was quite tidy. Although I guessed the perpetrator, it wasn't until towards the end of the book which is great. If you enjoy the series, you'll enjoy the book.

0545123283|3.0|Before I tell you my thoughts on Linger I want to back up a bit to Shiver.  I was on that Shiver train.  When I read it I raved about it, I bought a signed copy for myself and loaned it out to everyone (am still loaning it out to everyone!) and couldn't stop saying enough good stuff about it.  That was several months ago now and now I look back and try to think of what exactly I like about it.  And you know what comes to mind?  The writing.  I remember how it was wrote so beautifully, so lyrical and almost like poetry.  I don't remember growing attached to the characters, I don't remember being invested in them.  Would I love the book as much a second time around?  I honestly have no idea.  I have such a stack of books I want to read that I didn't have time to reread Shiver before Linger.  So if I did grow attached to them I think I simply forgot.  I do have a bad memory.  I didn't know I forgot.  I was VERY excited for Linger.  I wanted to read it so bad it hurt.  So when I got Linger in the mail I did the happy dance on the street in my purple fuzzy slippers and it was the fourth time or so checking the mail that day.  I was expecting it.<br /><br />I like to tell you guys how books make me feel. So that is mostly how my reviews go.  This book made me feel nothing at first.  I felt detached from the characters, I felt like I didn't know them.  I felt like Grace and Sam were different entities from the last book.  I did, however, feel more of an attachment to Isabel.  I'm not exactly sure why that is, but I really loved her character and strength in this book.  I also grew fairly attached to Cole, a new character introduced.  However I grew tired of the teen angst.  Everyone hating themselves and having some horrible past.  I mean really, does everyone have a horrible past?  Horrible parents that tried to kill them, parents that were just neglectful and forgot about them, parents that were so involved with themselves that they didn't give them enough attention?  It just seemed a little much, you know what I mean? I mean ALL the parents?!  Really?<br /><br />I also felt like the writing fell a bit more flat in this one.  I felt like it didn't have the lyrical sense of Shiver (again, remember I have a poor memory) but I do feel Maggie has the whole artsy, musician type person down pretty well and did a good job in portraying that aspect of the characters and made all that musician'y stuff flow quite well.  And that in itself was quite beautiful, so don't take me wrong, there was plenty of beauty in this book.  In the writing,  and the descriptions.  Now that I have you all ready to throw stones let me get to the good part.  Meaning more of the stuff I liked.  I already said that beauty was thrown in, just not as much as I had expected, but I said I felt detached from Grace and Sam in the beginning?  Well, they grew on me.  I mean, the attachment returned, or came for the first time, or whatever happened, but I did start to connect with them.  More with Sam then Grace though.  I still felt a slight detachment from her.  But because of what is happening through the book that may be somewhat intentional.<br /><br />This book was entertaining.  It was a good book.  I'm glad I read it.  Very glad actually.  And I'll still be buying the book (signed, hopefully), it just wasn't 'over- the- top -WOW- I'm -going- to -shove- this- in everyone's- face- and -force- them- to- read- it -good'.  I feel a bit let down.  I do anticipate Forever to have more going on and expect it to be more over the top.  This felt like the in-between greatness book.  Shiver was all about Sam and Grace falling in love and finding a way for Sam to not be wolf.  Linger was all about them trying to find a way to spend more time together and dealing with her parents who suddenly want to pay attention to her, and then a new character and their craziness was introduced, but it really felt like not much really happened. The next book, Forever, should be when all the action really happens.<br /><br />So what do I rate the book?  Hmmm... actually this is a difficult one for me.  3 stars seems almost harsh, but maybe this one needs harsh?  I mean we don't want all amazing raving reviews about the book, do we?  Well, I'll tell you this, in the end I was happy with where the story was going.  How the characters grew and what the future looks to be holding.  Although the book didn't live up to my super high expectations it was still a very good book.  But I'm going to have to go with my gut on this one and give it 3 stars.So what do I rate the book?

0307474712|5.0|For about a month, every publication I read was running a glowing review of this book. It started to look like something I just had to read -- so I ordered it, and then devoted one day to nothing but reading it. I found myself actually marvelling out loud (alone, and yes I realize that's kind of pathetic) that it was so well-written, so intelligently structured, with such particular and engaging characters. Halfway through, I was calling friends to recommend it. Following the lead of many reviews, I found myself watching an alternate cinematic version in my head as I read. And, now that I've finished it, I have to say that it was worth every great review, and worth all of the hype that led me to it in the first place. The characters were so well-written, and the language itself was a true joy to read. And, honestly, I can't recall a single book in my lifetime of reading that made me set it down so that I could cry for 15 minutes before diving back in. Now I'm waiting for the movie. But this is a book that I'll always have with me, and one that I'll keep coming back to.
B002ZG99CC|4.0|I went to see this film at movies with my son(8yrs), who goes to a local martial arts school and wanted to see this film on its opening weekend. Well let me tell you I was really blown away by this remake it is a great redo of the Karate kid, its follows the original at some points, but than makes a good mark on its own, Jaden Smith has an excellent performance,as well as most of the cast, the scenes of China were great and the martial arts sequences were done well and the general drama of the film was good.I will buy this movie when it becomes avaiable on DVD.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|A great CPU cooler, and not too hard to install.    Some points I'd like to make are,    1 - Fill in the grooves of the heatsink contact plate, scrape off the excess, and make sure the grooves are filled, and THEN apply extra thermal paste to provide good contact with the CPU    2 - The written instructions were clear enough, and would've worked, but I highly recommend you watch a couple of the installation videos provided online.    3 - make SURE you use something very clean and lint-free to spread the goo, as you don't want foreign matter in there. (I used a lint-free lab wipe, but a clean credit card works well too)    4 - it's a LOT easier if your case has a cut-out below the CPU, so you won't have to unplug everything and remove the motherboard to install this cooler.  If you're building a system and thinking about which case to buy, the Antec 300 has this cutout.     5 - look at the instructions, and make sure you spread the arms correctly to provide maximum stability for the clamp    6 - take off the fan before you install the heatsink, and clip the fan on after the sink is mounted, or you won't be able to screw in the clamp.    7 - if you install a second fan, be sure they are both pushing / pulling air in the same direction.  I used a VANTEC fan for the 2d one, and it's working great    8 - Another cool thing is that this fan can be installed in either direction. (that is, the heatsink can be mounted in the   or the - direction, so if your RAM chips / mobo setup won't let you go in one direction (or if one way will provide better airflow, given your casefan setup), you can switch.      9 - ground yourself early, and ground yourself often!    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-      the only ding I have against this cooler is that one of the screws on the clamp was not manufactured correctly.  There was a slight deviation in the threading on the screw, so instead of the threads looking like  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\  it looked like \\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\.    My cheesy fix was to take the mounting plug and the screw, (I did this away from the motherboard, of course), and just force the screw into the plug.  This resulted in that tiny mis-made part of the screw getting smashed flat against the screw shaft, but the screw still has plenty of threading to hold the clamp.  I doubt yours will have the same flaw, but you might want to try my cheesy fix.

B000BF0D9M|5.0|Having owned all the CD's that these favorites were taken from, I think this CD is an excellent compilation of the best of Jesse Cook's work. Of course, there are more songs I would like to see on it, but there's always personal preference, and they couldn't include ALL of them. I recommend this CD (actually a 2-CD set) to all Jesse Cook fans. It made an excellent birthday gift for my husband, the one who introduced me to Jesse Cook's wonderfully original music.
B003L16FAE|3.0|I've seen Predator probably several hundred times by now: first in the theater, then the VHS,then 3 different DVD versions, now with two different Blu-rays.  It's one of my all time favorite movies.  I've gotten pretty used to how it looks, and what it's supposed to look like.  The Ultimate Hunter Edition Blu-ray could have been the best, but several scenes were ruined by overzealous use of digital noise reduction (DNR) and digital processing.  As it is now, I'd probably rate the two Blu-ray releases equal.  The first scene in question is when Dutch, the General, and Dillon are talking near the beginning.  Dutch's red shirt is glowing neon red, and his five-o'clock-shadow looks like its painted on.  The old General looks like he had tons of Botox injections, and when he speaks, it looks somewhat \\"off\\".  But probably the worst is Dillon- he looks like he is made of plastic.  All the detail is gone from his lips and face, and it also looks \\"off\\" when he speaks, like his lips don't quite match his speech.  The smoke from Dutchs' cigar seems to magically emanate from the top of his head, probably because the DNR process mistook the smoke for graininess against the darkness of his face.   The other two scenes are minor in comparison to the first one:  When Mack is talking to Dutch after Blaine is killed, and they are setting up camp, he looks like he is glowing, and his skin is really plastic like.  The other is when Dutch is falling into the water- that shot had a lot of grain in the other versions.  In this version, it has been DNR'd to the extent now that it just looks fuzzy and blurry.   So these scenes don't add up to a whole lot of time when you take into account the whole movie.  But the thing is, these scenes didn't have to be altered the way they were.  The problem with the old Blu-ray was that it was encoded with an old codec (MPEG-2) and crammed on a singe layer Blu-ray.  This created artifacts and digital noise.  All Fox needed to do was encode with a bettercodec, and use a larger Blu-ray, and maybe use a conservative amount of grain reduction.   Unfortunately, as it is now, most of the movie looks good, but a small part makes me groan and wonder what the heck someone was thinking when they OK'd this.
0446567337|5.0|It was a great summer read. Much much much better than the movie! The characters were real, the love that they felt for one another was real, and in the end the ending was super realistic. He chose to enlist a second time, and the women felt like he chose the Army over their future. She couldn't wait around for forever, and she had someone in her life that needed her more than John did.

0143118420|1.0|I found her angst and this book overall rather annoying. I normally don't read this kind of book, but since a friend of mine kept nagging me to read it I decided to give it a try.  I truly went into it with an open mind, but halfway through the book all I kept thinking was; \\"when is this woman going to stop whining\\".  This isn't the story of a  woman going on a journey of self-discovery, this is about a frustrated woman that goes on a \\"poor little me\\" whining trip that never seems to end. This is my  personal view of the book and no one has to share it, those that liked it fine, sorry to say I do not include myself in that group.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|This is a widely used standard size found in most desktop computers (CMOS backup) as well as in some cameras, game watches, calculators, etc, as such, it is good to have a few on hand.<br /><br />NOTE: It is slightly thicker than CR2022 and can sometimes be used in place of them (such as on a motherboard).  However, be sure you are ordering the correct battery for tight fitting applications.
B003HARV3Y|1.0|This production team has ruined my Percy Jackson's world.  Especialy casting and story.    It might work if this movie was a stand alone story, not based on any novel.  I understand the word 'adaptation', but at least they should respect the original story and readers' feeling who really love this book.     I had been waiting for this movie...  They are so cruel..
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I use it with my Canon HG10 camcorder.  I thought the audio quality was great, but when my friend, one of the top audio engineers in the country, heard what came out of post, he was blown away...couldn't believe the sound quality for the price.

B000MV90F8|5.0|This is an outstanding Gregory Peck film.  I enjoy rewatching films for their performances and this one is near the top of my list.  The interation between the Vatacan, Peck, and Plummer are superb.  The acting that sustains those relationships is as good as it gets.  This is good intrigue set in WWII.  As a recounting of a true story, the screen play grows from helping a couple of allied troops behind Italian and German lins to mamaging over 4,000 from being captured.  The twist at the end of the film is totally unexpected, but I won't give it away.
0385523386|4.0|I ordered this book after hearing Piper Kerman's interview on NPR.  I found that while the beginning of the book was a little vague, the rest of the book was a terrific read.  I appreciated the many details about her life in prison and I found the details about the people that she encountered and the friends that she made fascinating.  The reason that I only gave the book 4 stars is because I feel that the book was missing an ending or perhaps an epilogue.  I was really looking forward to hearing about her adjustment back into society, her dealing with parole issues, the halfway house experience, her relationship with her fiance, and whether she kept in touch with any of the women that she met while incarcerated. That being said, I will still recommend this book to everyone.  Piper, please write a sequel to this book!
B002C39TU0|5.0|I'm not going to talk about the songs on this classic album since it's been done to death. What I'll say is specifically about the reissue of the record. This is a HEAVY record, literally. You know when you put it on the turntable that it's not regular vinyl. What really jumps out his how the bass and toms of the drums have a fullness like never before and the tambourine is clear as a bell on the title track, though it's hard to tell if that's from the remaster or the much better 180 gram vinyl. Despite being an alternative album with distorted guitars, there's a warmth that comes out which never really is heard on the CD. As for the physical pressing, my copy has no problems at all, and the thickness of the vinyl makes ticks and scratches hardly noticeable. My only complaint is the company I ordered from shipped it improperly (not Amazon) resulting in one of the corners being slightly damaged. Still highly recommended.
8186336141|5.0|This book is an excellent work on all aspects of yoga. It is based on the original concepts and principles of classical yoga in ancient India and much of the data in the book has been researched by Swamiji and his disciples to substantiate the substance. All true followers and practitioners of yoga should have a copy of this book close to them. Namaste`, Om Shanti!  Arvind
0553384775|5.0|The book is written in a fairly direct and harsh narrative, which makes gives the book an even stronger impact! It is a very entertaining book, part educational, part informative but a huge part of humorous and fun descriptions!!
B003RNXIBK|5.0|I have no doubt that Recovery will win Album of the Year at every major music award show in the next 12 months. This could be his best album yet and certainly the best rap album I've purchased in years.<br /><br />A little less swearing which is nice but still plenty of it. He has a slightly less angry flow in Recovery, with some great beats and even a great chorus here and there.<br /><br />He just seems more at peace on this album and I can tell he put a lot of heart and soul into this one....on top of pure talent.
B002VECLVO|3.0|Bespectacled Englishman George Falconer (Colin Firth) has grown tired of waking up and preparing for his daily role as a professor of literature in a Southern California college.  He has lost his male lover of 16 years to an auto accident, and he is quietly making plans to commit suicide in a manner that won't leave a terrible mess for his housekeeper.<br /><br />Set in 1962 Los Angeles, \\"A Single Man\\" resembles nothing so much as a Graham Greene story, describing a tightly-controlled expatriate Brit who has lived an \\"invisible\\" life, as the member of an unacknowledged minority.<br /><br />The problem with the movie is that \\"there is no 'there' there\\", (quoting Gertrude Stein speaking about the feeling of living in Los Angeles.)  Colin Firth does a good job acting, but still comes off as a pale shadow of a young Michael Caine.  Julianne Moore adds a little color and sports a British accent as George's friend, but she seems to be doing a version of Angie Dickinson.<br /><br />The movie is kind of a guide to \\"how things were\\" for a gay outsider in the early Sixties, and there are clever scenes, as when George flirts with another foreigner in Spanish. acknowledging their status.  \\"I think you just need someone to like you\\", the handsome Spaniard tells George.<br /><br />I wanted to like this movie, but it suffocates from its own over-earnestness.  I expect better from its director in the future.
B00008ENTJ|5.0|\\"DADDY, THIS ALBUM'S ON CD! YOU EVEN HAVE IT. NO ONE LISTENS TO RECORDS ANYMORE\\". A sound argument, if you pardon the pun. Yes, this classic has been out on the CD for years. I won't even talk about the songs. By now, this album has been talked about and played on the radio for so long with its legendary tracks like the title track, \\"The Logical Song\\", \\"Goodbye Stranger\\", etc., you wonder if anything new needs to be said...<br /><br />Then the reissue on vinyl came out.<br /><br />I was cautious about buying an album I know so well again on an old system. My system isn't anything that fancy. A Yamaha receiver, Technica turntable, and Polk speakers. And the difference was immediate the moment I took the record out.<br /><br />Here's the key. This is a heavy record, literally. When you take it out it's jacket, you feel the difference of the 180 gram platter. This makes a huge difference. The record is more resistant to scratches and ticks than a standard record. When you play it, you really feel the sound fill the room. The vocals sound almost it's live in the room. The acoustic instruments they use so often like clarinet and sax leap out at you. The drums don't sound thin. There's a warmth that carries tough that enhances the album like never before, almost orchestral which was such an important part of the Supertramp sound. Even if you've heard this album before, the reissued vinyl scrapes all the memories of what you thought Breakfast In America was, and becomes an experience like hearing for the first time. More over, the way it was meant to be heard. Highly recommended!
B000H5TVJY|4.0|I was intrigued by American Psycho when I initially heard about it. I didn't really know much other than Christian Bale kills a lot of people. Having watched it, this movie is probably one of the darkest if not the darkest film you may ever watch. It is very gory and quite disturbing at points. However it is quite thought provoking. It raises large questions about life and how one should live it. How we interact with others is a major theme of the movie. I was thinking something along the lines of Hannibal Lecter when I purchased this. It is not quite as thrilling, but far more terrifying in its insanity.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|All my friends & I enjoy this show.  The sexual tension is so thick you couldn't even nick it with an ax.  This is one of a very few select shows that I eagerly await the next episode.   This show just gets better and better with each episode.  By the end of this disc set, you're still wanting more.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|We enjoyed the miniseries John Adams very much and did not want it to end.  Movie-makers kept to the book and history well.  Computer work is excellent and adds to the grandeur.  The acting is top notch. The added features are very good.  Turn on the feature \\"Facts are stubborn things\\" for added background info.
B0037QGS0A|2.0|Oh, brother.  I thought we'd seen the last of the \\"Fatal Attraction\\" movies about psychotic lovers, crazed babysitters, whacked-out Lesbian writers, etc. that terrorize those oh-so-perfect suburban marriages.<br /><br />Then, along comes \\"Chloe\\".  This movie telegraphs its predictable plot twists from the first scene.  Without giving away \\"spoilers\\", I can say that I had the progression of events figured out within the first half-hour.  I have to say I felt some disappointment seeing Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore in the kind of \\"adultery melodrama\\" that the Lifetime channel regularly delivers.<br /><br />Prurient in ways mostly involving money and class distinction,  these movies are very cynical and unimaginative.  It didn't do much at the box office, though, which means that maybe people have finally had enough of these predictable potboilers.
9626348976|3.0|This is one of my favorite Georgette Heyer stories. I have it unabridged on audio-cassette but its aged and some of the tapes are broken so I thought this CD would be a good alternative.   The reader is excellent, her character voices are well done, the sound quality is very good, nice music in the intervals, etc. but its abridged - and quite a lot at that.  I suppose they have to cut something in order to abridge, but just know that there is a lot missing as far as the witty conversation that Heyer so beautifully designs to flesh out her characters. Some of the funniest moments aren't included and as a result the story is a lot less interesting. So, those who haven't read the book, do so before judging Heyer's amazing talent.  I don't think I will order Naxos' Sylvester version... I couldn't stand it being cut up.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|This album was not at all what I expected. I was actually hoping for another album like his first or second one. In my opinion, the slim shady lp and marshall mathers lp are his best albums. I was about 20 to 22 years old when they came out, and I love them just as much today at 31 years of age. They still manage to put a smile on my face and crack me up. I dont think that the eminem show was quite as good, but it is still classic eminem. Then came encore which just never caught on with me. With the exception of the song puke, it just seemed to go a different direction from what I had become used to from eminem. Alot of time passed and I thought that eminem was finished, but then comes relapse. I was so excited, but then I was little let down after hearing it because it still wasnt the eminem from his first two albums that I loved. But, it didnt take long, after playing through relapse a few times, I loved it and it didnt leave my cd player for months. Then comes recovery which is even further away from his early work. Needless to say I was dissapointed after my first listen. I guess I just keep hoping that the eminem from 10 years ago will come back. But, just like relapse, after a few listens I am hooked and I cant get enough of recovery. I guess I understand that he has gone through alot of personal changes and that his music is going to reflect that. Eminem has gone from hilarious/bashing songs to a much more grown up mature type of music. Recovery is definitly not the eminem from the early days, but give it a chance and you will love it. As a die hard eminem fan, I have adjusted to the change and I love his new style of music, and you will to. Oh, and by the way, in this download everything free on the internet era, I always still go to the local store and buy a new copy of every eminem album. He and his music are worth the money. I can see myself listening to all of his albums for the rest of my life. Eminem, you are the greatest, and we are lucky to live in your time. Keep the new albums coming eminem, and we will keep buying them.

0393072231|5.0|The global financial panic of 2008 stemmed from the collapse of the market for mortgage-backed bonds and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Executives at many major financial institutions were slow to recognize the true risk of interest-bearing securities backed by home mortgages. Yet some money managers not only predicted the collapse of the mortgage securities market but also profited from it. Best-selling author Michael Lewis writes a narrative that moves along like a novel. He profiles a handful of money managers who correctly forecast that an explosion of mortgage loan defaults would flatten the housing industry and slam U.S. economic growth. Though he focuses his engrossing narrative on these contrarian investors, Lewis also traces the roots of the 2008 crisis to original U.S. policy decisions in the 1980s that allowed major Wall Street firms to become publicly held - thus making the investment banks themselves objects of speculation and letting bankers gamble with their stockholders' investments. getAbstract recommends this compelling book to readers who want deeper insights into the U.S. financial system from the perspective of obscure money wranglers who bet against the subprime industry when few others would - and made a fortune.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|Martin Scorsese delivers one of the best brain-twisters in film history using old movie techniques like a great story, excellent acting and one heck of a ride. Hitchcock would be proud to tell Martin, \\"You nailed it.\\" DiCaprio is allowed to be outstanding even in the presence of the greatness of Max Von Sydow and Ben Kingsley as Scorsese effortlessly crafts a thriller with some many dimensions it is breathtaking. Still, Sydow and Kingsley add a dimension of surreality.    Shutter Island is surreal. Leo and Mark Ruffalo (nice work as his sidekick) are Federal Marshalls looking for an escaped mental patient. Ruffalo's downplay of his part again allowed DiCaprio's character to dominate while not dominating. Tough thing to do. Scorsese does it like Hitchcock did. The weirdness blends into the dark island but familiar uses of familiar sets adorns the film like a tight glove.    Is it psychological or mystical? Is it real or not? Who is sane and insane? It ain't Tommy Lee Jones looking for the Fugitive. The Departed (also Martin's creation) was excellent and sucked you in but Shutter Island never lets you leave. After the movie ends, you'll still be on Shutter Island for awhile. The movie opens and closes. Doors slam and open. The ferryman, Scorsese, isn't about to let you leave till you look deep inside yourself. Now, that's why Shutter Island is his finest work to date.     If you love special effects, it ain't here. If you like action, it ain't Iron Man 2 but far more exciting. Shutter Island is like a painting in reverse or a beautiful flower unfolding and withering. Shutter Island, like many like it, is why we have movie screens. Other than Ordinary People, it is the only perfect film. No gimmicks just a story worthy of telling many times over.
B000EOTAM6|4.0|I didn't go into Aeon Flux expecting much, and was pleasantly surprised at how much it delivered.  It's a surprisingly literate, thoughtful interpretation.  Of course, Charlize looks hot as hell in various \\"Fetish Ball\\" outfits, and the stunts are occasionally breathtaking.    But the real surprise about this movie is just how smart it is.  It is only loosely based on the MTV Aeon Flux animated series, but it is true to the shows \\"Vibe\\", and works as a surprisingly astute commentary on 21st C society.  The care and attention that went into the script shines, and puts this far beyond your usual film/comic adaptation.    The \\"special edition\\" DVD contains two commentary tracks, and well over an hour of well-done special features.    It's beautiful, it's smart, it's fun, it has sexy mutant women in bondage gear, it has lots of cool toys and explosions...what more could you want?
B001P9EQH8|5.0|If you get this, you will be amazed at the TINY size!  It is about the size of the original iPod shuffle and has a clip attach it to belt, strap, etc.  I have not tested battery life.  I was looking for something to boost volume just a bit for certain devices.  I have a pair of noise-cancelling headphones that work great, but the in-line volume control seems to attenuate the sound just a bit so that even with volume all the way up on both iPod and headphones the volume is just enough.  I am not talking high volume, which I can't tolerate, but just comfortable listening.  The FiiO is capable of producing volume higher than I can stand it.  I have also used it with a nice little portable speaker that I use sometimes to listen to audiobooks while showering.  Again the volume was barely enough to hear over the water.  The FiiO allowed just that one or two decibels to make it easier to hear.  In both cases it was not a matter of pushing the speakers themselves by any means.  When listening to music I keep the volume fairly low so it is more background.  When listening to audiobooks or anything where understanding the words is important, I need a little more volume.  In both cases it just seemed like the iPod output just wasn't enough even with the volume limit set to max.  Anyway, the tiny FiiO does an impressive job of amplifying for my needs.  I have not noticed any decrease in sound quality.  It comes with two 3.5 patch cords, one about 1 ft long the other about 3 feet, as well as a USB A to mini B for charging, so it is not necessary to purchase anything else to use it.  As far as controls it has power button, volume, and bass boost switch.
1416584072|2.0|The ending is superb and deeply satisfies the reader. All of the narration comes together to leave an accomplishment... but had I not persevered through the book my initial lack of interest (which spanned for 3/4 of the book) would have won out. Brick Lane takes too long to go anywhere and seems to spend too much time explaining the plot rather than living it. Nazneen's seclusion from the world did not work to the favor of this book and her emotions seem stifled. Hasina's letters seem to be a bit odd in place as Nazneen only seems to be casually interested in them. However, if you can wait out for the last few chapters of the book you will find that it is a quiet gem of a read... though you may not read it twice.
B000F7CMQ8|3.0|After the 2nd World War, Clark Gable was rarely able to recreate the excitement of so many of his thirties films. Not only was he ageing of course, but his biographers record that he never got over the loss of wife Carole Lombard in 1942. He was letting himself go. MGM, his home studio, clearly recognised the change and many of his postwar films are a trial. \\"Mogambo,\\" released in 1953, is a notable exception. John Ford filmed this action adventure and it is minor work in his canon, simply because the filming is straightforward and expert but with no particular Ford imprint.<br /><br />A remake of a previous success, the raunchy and funny \\"Red Dust\\" from 1932, Gable stars as an African game hunter on safari with 2 worthwhile leading ladies, the sensuous, amusing playgirl, Ava Gardner, and the icy, married Gracy Kelly. The plot is simple. Both woman fall for Gable and the melodrama revolves around how this plays out amongst lots of location shots of the scenary, native tribesmen and animals. Gable is perfectly cast as the macho hero and Gardner hits the right notes to make believable that she, 20 years his junior, would be his sort of woman. Kelly is much less successful and inferior to Mary Astor in the same role in the original film. Being an MGM star production, the ladies look ludicrously immaculate even on safari.<br /><br />The print is excellent preserving the glorious technicolour but there are no extras except the original trailer. The film is best value if purchased as part of the Gable Signature Collection.
0451529308|3.0|I think Little Women is best read at a younger age. As an adult, I can see the important lessons in regard to friendship, family and finding your place in the world even when it goes against the norm. I appreciate the simple tone and wording that would make this book an easy read for a middle school child. And in the end, the book is ultimately a coming of age story that would be better suited for someone much younger than myself.<br /><br />Reading the book as an adult, I found it hard to get into. It went from slow and meandering in the beginning to an almost break-neck pace towards the end. It was heavy on description and the characters weren't all that deep. I know it's a classic and people love these girls, but they seemed very two dimensional to me. Each had her very own set of traits and none seemed to share a trait with another as sisters would. While that could allow for each character to be her own person and made it easy to distinguish one from the next, it didn't seem real.<br /><br />A wonderful book for children, but the experience doesn't justify a reading as an adult. I'm glad to have read it to try to understand the perpetual love people have for it, it wasn't something I enjoyed enough to ever want to read again. I would recommend it to my daughters for it's message, but I wouldn't recommend it to my friends as recreational reading.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This movie reveals the truth of the practices of the way our food is raised and produced.  We have been living in a fantasy and thinking that our food comes from nice and friendly family farmers when in most cases this is not the case.  This movie really opened my eyes and as a result my family and I have started making many changes to the way we approach food.  I look forward to more information and to more people making decisions that will cause the big companies to change their practices!
1934137197|5.0|Harding takes being in the moment to a whole new level of writing.  The novel unfolds as a series of tableaus alternating between a father and son in the distant past, and the son dying as an old man in the present.  The novel is driven not so much by plot as by character development and the writing, which at times is akin to the best of contemporary poetry.  A mandatory addition to the required reading list for first year college courses on contemporary American literature.
0312379293|5.0|This was my first Jeffrey Archer novel and I'm wondering, how did I miss this guy?  From the first page until the very last, I was truly amazed at the quality of characters, the storyline and everything in between in this outstanding book.  There is nothing I can add to the rest of the great reviews here.  This book is truly outstanding in every way.<br /><br />Highly recommended and I'd give it 10 stars if I could.
0375831002|5.0|IF you lived during WWII and the aftermath, you will find this beautifully written work a reflection of what must have been experience of all the children in Germany, Nazi or otherwise.  It contains such an undercurrent of sorrow (assuming you lived in that time) and, at the same time the mind of a child that the writer must have had a personal muse to assist him with the story.  Unlike some reviewers, I would not categorize this book as a teenage novel.  Life is hard enough without adding to their reality.  For zealots of war, it is a good book as it demonstrates the price of bigotry and as they say \\"there but for the grace of God go I\\".

Elizabeth wants to explore the world and find the meaning with life. After a nasty devorce she sets out for Italia, India and Indonesia on a years trip, 4 months in each place.  I really loved that you get some culture and experience from these continents. Elizabeth also includes the reader in her filosofi of what she is experiencing getting her self back.

B001RTSPVY|1.0|I feel kinda bad giving this a one-star review as I feel the first series was compelling and superbly-crafted (especially the first three or four episodes), but the bottom line is I couldn't get through more than about half of the second season:  I just got so sick of the writers' same lame tricks.<br /><br />What tricks?<br /><br />It seemed as if, in some scriptwriting workshop, the writers had been told the importance of having CONFLICT on the screen.  You gotta have AGON!  You can't simply have people getting along and life going swell:  people have to be arguing.<br /><br />But it's as though the writers never made it to the second chapter of that screenwriting book, wherein you learn that agon must arise insuppressibly out of character and circumstance.  Instead, it's like whenever things get slow, they had one character or another start acting irrational just to keep the tension up.  It got so predictable.  At one point, Jesse asks Walt, \\"Hey, 6 grand a day we're making! What's your problem?!\\"<br /><br />It would have been very accurate if Walt had simply retorted: \\"Hey, I have to have a problem of some sort!  The script is kinda lagging at this point and we need some yelling to keep the tension up!\\"<br /><br />In other words, despite its many merits (especially acting), I think this is a good example of a TV show with a premise but no story.  They've got a set-up, but they have no idea what to do with it, so they just keep having the characters go at each other for silly stuff just to keep the drama up.<br /><br />I was totally willing to believe that these two were cooking and selling drugs:  what I was totally unable to swallow was that they'd been cooking and selling drugs for a long time, totally getting away with it, WHILE ALL THE TIME being irresponsible, irrational hotheads who start yelling at each other, showing up in places they aren't supposed to be, and acting in impulsive, improvident ways.  No, no:  people who really do stuff like this and get away with it for years are cautious, circumspect, low-key, and even risk-averse.<br /><br />Interestingly, the point where I turned it off was where Walt starts banging on Jesse's door, creating a totally unnecessary and dangerously risky scene.  I might have been able to buy that hair's-breadth escape at Tuco's grandfather's, but, strange as it sounds, Walt pounding on the door like that stretched believability way too far.t, low-key, and even risk-averse.

B001OQCV6K|5.0|I enjoyed this movie, it gave a good set up for the possibility of other Sherlock Holmes movies. I haven't read any of the books so I don't know how true the characters are to their original concepts, but Sherlock has been given some superb pugilism skills that are explained via his genius detective abilities, but it's really there to keep modern American audiences entertained but doesn't go to the extent of making him a superhero.

0446679089|5.0|This book was very entertaining and i must say that i loved the John Corey character. Im not going to spoil anything here but i will say that toward the middle/end of the book new information is realized and the story was not what i had expected it to be at all (which is not necessarily a bad thing) I found the book to be very entertaining throughout and would definitely recommend it!
0307269981|1.0|My wife has read all the books in this series and enjoyed them so I thought I'd try the second installment after seeing the movie of \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\".  In my humble opinion Stieg Larsson is no writer.  The book is full of irrelevant details and long winded descriptions of places and things which only distract from it's exiting plot line.  The book could be 1/3 as long and not suffer a bit.  Larsson's use of language is pat and unimaginative - even boring.  The writing is just terrible.  The plot seems like it was written to be turned into an action movie - which it has and which is much better than the books.  For the life of me I cannot understand why these books are so popular.  Spend your money on the movies, not the books.
0143038419|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The author has a great style of writing and an equally wonderful sense of humor.  I think this book has something to offer everyone.
0142410373|5.0|I have read a couple of Roald Dahl's books in the last couple of days.  These include Matilda, but also [[ASIN:0142410365 James and the Giant Peach]] and [[ASIN:0142410314 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]] .  I feel that these are some of the better know works by the beloved children's author.  I have been recommended other works by him, but these three have been sitting around my house before I picked them up.<br /><br />A theme Dahl likes is to have some outside agent create something special about the main child characters of his books.  Charlie gets a golden ticket;  James spills a bag of magic at the base of a peach tree.  Matilda, already a precocious child, develops telekinesis.<br /><br />A difference is what the protagonists do with the intervention.  James and Charlie to me are ciphers.  They just pass through the amazing events that happen to them without effecting any real change.  They stand as blank slates for the child reader to project the self onto.  Matilda is different.  She's different from her peers in school, but also from the other Dahl characters.  She takes the gift that Dahl gives her and makes it into something that changes her world.  Matilda has an agency that other Dahl characters lack, and for me this makes her a far more relatable and sympathetic character.  She creates her own happily ever after, and isn't just handed it.<br /><br />Although, as a critique, Matilda inhabits the same black and white world that is fairly limited in the possibilities of what can happen.  Characters are either  wholly good or wholly bad, and nothing else.  I realize the audience requirements expected at the time of writing supported a world like that, but more recent YA fiction allows for complex characters that have depth.
159448385X|5.0|This book is excellent.  I would put it on the must read list.  It makes you step back and really think of how lucky we are and how precious life is.  The book brings you through a range of emotions, sadness, anger, love....how can these men treat these women like they do?   All in all, this is a book that I will be reading again.
B002VKE1K2|3.0|One of the scariest movies of all time ranking with Blair Witch and Poltergeist. Will not be seeing this one again even in HD. It's just way too scary. Stay away from this one after one viewing which is enough no matter what video format (DVD or BD).
030726999X|4.0|This book, while excellent reading, is probably the weakest of the \\"Salander\\" trilogy.  It moves right along and both Salander and Blomqvist are very interesting and well drawn characters, especialy Lisbeth. However, the constant \\"coincidences\\" become a little difficult to accept. Still, great summer (or any other season for that matter) reading.  It's a tragedy than Stieg Larsson, the author, died so young.
B00004XQ83|4.0|I loved the music,but was disappointed because i could not burn a copy or even copy it to my hard drive.
B0031RAOVY|4.0|I already knew something about the original story, and I can tell that this version is quite good.<br />It's an excellent movie for a sunday afternoon. If you have couple or you are in process of it, I recomend it.<br />You don't need to buy it in HD, i looks good anyway. What it matters is what it makes you feel.
0156012197|5.0|This book has been an absolute favorite of mine since I was just old enough to read it. I still have my original copy and I am never going to sell it. It is a great read, especially if you are find of books with shorter chapters.  I have an old version of this book, so hopefully they haven't changed it at all.

B003A4IFGY|3.0|THIS TP&HB ALBUM SOUNDS MORE LIKE THE \\"MUDCRUTCH\\" ALBUM HE PUT OUT LAST YEAR THAN A TYPICAL ALBUM FROM TOM AND THE HEARTBREAKERS.  THERE ARE A COULPLE GOOD TUNES, BUT THE STYLE IS DIFFERENT ENOUGHT THAT I WAS KINDA DISSAPOINTED.  I WAS HOPING TO HEAR STYLES LIKE FROM \\"FULL MOON FEVER\\", OR \\"INTO THE GREAT WIDE OPEN, OR\\"WILDFLOWERS\\"  ANYWAY NEW MUSIC FROM TP IS ALWAYS BETTER THAN NO NEW MUSIC FROM TP.
B003A4IFGY|5.0|With this offering, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers have gone so truthfully to the heart of what every Rock and Blues fan wants to hear, by recording what they as band really want to play. Bravo!! They stick it to the mainstream expectation with it's 'easy come - easy go' pop format, and really dig into the raw feel of everlasting 70's Rock tone - and an effort of variety in terms of genre that would make Led Zep happy to step away from the studio.
B003LAH7MU|3.0|Sting has always brought us to new places and shown us new perspectives, often with dazzling musical brilliance and unusual depth of insight. This new symphonic album has some good aspects and strong arrangements but despite the orchestral direction it unfortunately doesn't take me to what really feels like a new place because the material is all old and of a greatest hits variety. These are all songs I've loved and listened to a lot so it's interesting to hear these new versions but for me they don't add too much because the melodies and basic songs are the same. When I heard about this album I rushed out to get it because I thought it was actually a symphonic album by Sting which sounded like a big step. Well it turned out to be a smaller step. It's professionally orchestrated and very well performed with a somewhat Broadway feel. A good coffee table disc rather than a breakthrough but your mum will probably love it!
B003W62YM6|4.0|I like this new show from Syfy but don't know if it will get enough support to last very long. The characters are interesting and as the season progresses, hope they get fleshed out more. Now can this be called scifi or fantasy or drama, I will leave up to each person to decide but whatever you call it, I will call it good fun and good watching.    One thing I did notice is that on the season downloads amazon has the listed as episodes 1 and 3 when in fact they are episodes 1 and 2. What happened Amazon?
B0036S4CTS|4.0|I also bought this on recommendation of Entertainment Weekly; I will not say I was let down, obviously I gave it four stars.  But the novel shocked me and I have yet to decide if I liked the &#34;twist&#34; or not.  I will say that I enjoyed spending time with both these characters (yes, even the raffish Dexter) if only for a short time.  The book itself gives the best example of the theme &#34;live each day like it is your last&#34; that I have come across since the Broadway musical Rent.
031606792X|5.0|I was a bit put off by all of the Twilight hype. So I refused to read the books or watch the movies. Twilight (the first movie) came on cable so I decided to watch and I WAS HOOKED! I am a 37 year old, mother of two, so not a teenager in the least. Within a week I had watched all three movies and read all the novels. I purchased the last saga, Breaking Dawn on Saturday afternoon, and finished the novel by Sunday night. I could not put it down! By far, in my opinion the most complex of the four novels with some really intriguing twists thrown in. A must read if you enjoyed any of the earlier novels.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Coldplay seem to just keep getting better. This is a different approach, especially the title track with strings (which I love) but that's just the tip of the iceberg. This is a really good album and I'm happy to hear how they've continued breaking new ground as a band. Great lyrics, playing and as always well engineered with very big sound to it. Jonny Buckland has some catchy riffs on this and his hooks direct the songs in subtle but strong ways. It would be interesting to hear him really take center stage but what he does is cool. Overall I'd have to say this is my favorite album of theirs yet and a consistent pleasure to listen to!
0756405890|4.0|Solid fantasy novel except for this stupid framing device he uses, which really a friend or agent or editor should have gotten him to take out of there, as it just interrupts a reader's suspension of disbelief, waking us up from the fictive dream not just once but over and over and over again every time he shoehorns it back into the main narrative. He has written several songs and poems for the world, and they are pretty darned good, really giving you the sense of \\"real\\" folk songs.  I liked this enough that I'll certainly read the next one in the series.  But that framing device better pay off in spades in novel 3, or I'm going to heave it across the room with great force.
B002VJ0576|1.0|One has to know Asylum home entertainment to appreciate such a film. Definitely dreadful but sometimes funny in its own way. I could not recommand it. Definitly not.
B00328G4V6|5.0|A Hendrix release is always a bit of an event and thankfully this one justifies all the praise. A blues-drenched psychedelic daydream of an album with the usual mighty guitar stylings of the maestro. The songs are OK, a lot of funky riffs and good-time \\"Yeah, yeah's\\" but the title track has a classic feel and all the versions of older songs are just wailing! The guitar playing and watershed of blues rock is what elevates this album and I think maybe the brightest burning moment of it all is his cover of Cream's Sunshine Of Your Love. That's a must have for any Hendrix collection!
B001RXB4FY|5.0|I hadn't heard of this band until someone compared my band to them and I was like \\"who is Volbeat?\\" well comparing them to my band turned out to be a big compliment. As soon as I heard the album My band wanted to cover \\"Radio Girl.\\" Anyway, you will not be disappointed if you buy a Volbeat album, they sound like Danzig/Metallica/and Johny Cash all mixed into one. Also if you like volbeat, you'll like my band The Barstool Saints. check us out at [...]. Our debut album is also here on Amazon MP3. Enjoy!
030726999X|4.0|I have read all three of Larsson's books now (I am not quite finished this one yet).  All three are fascinating. This one gets a little more divided in focus that the first two which causes me a little loss of concentration with so many different aspects to the story.  Nevertheless, I find the characters interesting, the plot moves well. I have come to care about what happens.  Good book.
B00275EHJG|4.0|\\"Toy Story 3\\" marks the return of our beloved plastic incarnations, Woody and Buzz Lightyear and their fellow comrades. Andy, their owner, a growing boy the last time we've seen him, now a full-fledged young man, is heading off to his first year at a university. The obvious cause of conflict is his departure: what to make of their existence without them being played around; after all, the nature of their being as toys is to be there to be played. Justifiably so, armed with tenacity and perseverance, the toys end up planning their escape from an inevitable ownerless future as either forgotten, dust-gathering toys in the attic, as toy donations, or worse, dumps in the trash. Andy makes a final decision to take Woody, and the rest of them goes to the attic; the toys sadly agreed, their loyalty will surely be repaid: Andy will be back again someday. Mistaken as trash by Andy's mom, however, the toys are dumped into a garbage truck. They manage to escape; soon, they find themselves in a nearby child care playroom, led by a seemingly innocuous adorable bear, Latso, who appears to have an entourage, one of them is Barbie's counterpart, Ken, and a huge unkempt baby doll, with scarred features. Latso ends up deceiving the newcomers to go to the section where young kids play without any trace of care or regard; whereas he and his turf stay in the older kid's section, where they are loved and cherished the way toys are. Eventually, Woody comes into rescue, and does it before Andy goes back to college for one last goodbye...    In a fast-paced, hyperkinetic, and thoroughly entertaining manner, \\"Toy Story 3\\" delivers the fun and jokes. Indeed, it is a very good and worthy film to serve as the final bookend of the trilogy. Sure, it does not pick up until the second act, where the toys are trapped in the day care, and Woody makes an elaborate escape plan, but the inventiveness and the fresh takes on being an escapee from a prison is brilliant here, especially Mr. Potato Head's decision to use a tortilla as his body, as his former one has been discarded. Another clever and hilarious sequence involves a cymbal banging monkey, serving for Latso, as it watches the security cameras, guarding anyone who would leave the prison, banging and screeching as soon as it sees something suspicious. Regardless of this merriment, however, the film is lacking the humanity and the undercurrent of introspective melancholy that have seared underneath the workings of the first two films, particularly the second one. The merriment found in \\"Toy Story 3\\", as genuinely crowd-pleasing as it is, seems displaced and unwarranted, being that this is the third and last film in the series.     One could say that this is a kid's film, after all, but we are also talking about Pixar Films here, who have a penchant for peppering their films with darkness and even cruelty that only adults and discerning children could truly understand and appreciate. So, it is by the virtue of the consistent regularity of churning out complex works that one is justifiable in expecting something that could match and even surpass the intense humanity of the previous two films that \\"Toy Story 3\\" will bring everything into a close that is a moving and transcendental work of art. What we get is rather a fairly conventional, though no less heartbreaking account of moving on and transitioning into a different phase of life. What makes it conventional and admittedly, actually frustrating, is that in this film, it is all about Andy, a boy who has already been growing older since the second film, and whose interests are slowly evolving from cowboy toys to real cowgirls; and frankly, a character whom we truly never had a real connection with, in the first place. Thus, the conclusion seems an alternative to a real one; as earnest and moving as it is, it is unearned, and thus, cheaply sentimental, when it should be a genuinely primal type of poignancy; that type of pain that forever twinges the throbbing heart.     Seeing Woody, Buzz Lightyear, and co., risking their lives for one boy, whose goals and function in life has changed due to biological transition, is a frustrating experience. Their characterizations that have been lovingly and delicately realized in the first and second film have now been rendered rather secondary to, at best, in-jokes, audience familiarity, and as fodder for elaborate set pieces, and at worse, subservient to Andy's. What makes the first and second film brilliant are the toys' humanity as a focal point; meaning, their struggling existence serve as basis for everything, including the existence of Andy and other human beings, and not the other way around; after all, this is why it's called \\"Toy Story\\". Andy, in other words, is merely a catalyst, ironically speaking; he is rendered inhuman, as the toys are human, and their struggles are response, either as a reaction or a pro-action, in relation to Andy's non-existence, and alongside these struggles, these toys are increasingly becoming complex. In the third film, we never get to see any of this: the whole plan of going back to Andy's arms is all action, and it is great action, but it never has that melancholy quality which all at once, further develops the characters. In turn, they merely lapse back to the toys that they are, which seems to be the point: they are toys, after all, regardless whether or not they have a life on their own; and being toys -subservient, naively loyal, even stupid- is their  function. However, the philosophical existential implications of the \\"Toy Story\\" films have always been apparent, even in the first film: despite manufactured at toy factories, these toys have their own distinct personalities, capable of feeling happiness and loneliness, and have a will of their own. They are active agents, even if it is only when the humans are not around to see them. Thus, the counter-argument is rendered moot.     The endless possibilities of one's nature of existence existat the very outset of the concept of these toys having a life of their own, and there are many possibilities. With their own consciousness, they are able to think; and with thinking, and its endless discourse, surely, at some point, they are able to transcend their mode of consciousness, which is merely on the basis of them being toys, into something that is on the basis of their existence as living, thinking beings, regardless of their lack of biological mechanisms. In other words, thinking, in its own nature, whether or not the thinker is a human or a non-object, is continually ahead of itself; thus, thinking alone is always at the cusp of immense potential for continual evolution. This is probably why the now infamous furnace scene, where the toys linked hands as a sign of their embracing of death, is transgressively brilliant, ethereally moving, and subversively dark: not merely because they have lost their purpose as toys, but almost as a defiant gesture to the naysayers who are underestimating their capabilities for continual transformation, these perhaps include the filmmakers. It is an act that is simultaneously a hopeless surrender, almost a suicide, in the face of a bleak world; and at the same time, as a full realization of their demise, a renunciation of their capabilities of their thinking, conscious beings; thus paradoxically rendering themselves as human as possible.    Of course, one is not necessarily clamouring for an existential, nihilistic work here, especially if it is a film whose main audiences are children, even if one is, it is forever pointless. It is a real shame, however, since the predecessors have been subversive works of acute longing for human contact and perpetual love, one's expectations have heightened even to impossible proportions. \\"Toy Story 3\\" is untapped with unrealized potentials that remain merely lurking at the corners of its every frame. The filmmakers had something truly special and beautiful here, but perhaps, they thought happy, content kids are better than disturbed, distraught, crying ones; if that's the case, then I'll stick with peaceful environs too.

B002ZG980U|4.0|Executed in fast-paced, hurrying pace, like a ticking bomb waiting for its explosive denouement, Christopher Nolan's \\"Inception\\" has that electric energy that is highly reminiscent of his previous works, especially \\"The Dark Knight\\", it's as if one is suddenly put in an already developing dire situation that calls for the survival of the fittest. Nolan has always been great in establishing chaotic, corrupt worlds, not merely as backdrops, but as centerpieces alongside his philosophical explorations of conceptional human values and struggles through his always well-developed characters. This works well, as the viewer is suddenly sucked into a particular created universe without even any hesitations or questions asked because of its extremely elaborated believable, if not heightened, chaos; immersing in it is structurally connected to watching the story unfold; in other words, being in it is the story itself.    However, this relationship between ordered chaos and effective storytelling is not as organic here as it is in his previous films; this time around, the former negates the latter to some extent. The reason is mostly because the film is dealing with a heavily metaphysical concept, and it is a huge concept at that one too, of entering into one's dreams for information and secrets. Like any works in science fiction, it is a requirement to dwell into at least some form of exposition to explain the mechanism of a certain phenomena or wonder, otherwise the story lapses into a mumbo-jumbo concoction of irrational half-conceived ideas that render the populated world of the characters and themselves implausible; this might work in the fantasy genre, which even then still requires the logistics of rationality, but in science fiction, exposition is almost always a requirement. Almost.    In \\"Inception\\", the characters seem secondary to the film's conceptualized dream abstractions. Indeed, its treatment of dreams is original, admirable and even awe inspiring. The layeringof dreams, each paralleling another at a different time, in a different place; and the set-up of rules depending on the layer of the dream is particularly impressive. Only in this film, one could say a van falling off bridge into the river, slow-motioned for about 30 minutes, completely makes sense, not to mention thoroughly heart-pounding. And the concept of 'limbo' where one could get stuck in a dream for ten years is terrifying. But the film's heavy reliance on exposition, is both a blessing and a curse.    On one hand, as soon as the mechanisms and the logistics of the act of entering dreams have been verbalized, and reiterated over and over again, the film works straight-laced in its razor sharp fluidity of action, a cause-and-effect extravaganza on the basis of the conceptualizations of dreaming, depending, of course, on its whereabouts; the farther the layer is, the deeper trouble one is in. If there's one thing that one could thoroughly admire about Nolan is that his action sequences are not rumbling, arbitrary set-pieces, design to blow up buildings to impress, but both reactions and pro-actions are on the basis of a particular tense situation, populated by struggling, deciding characters. On the other hand, this same intellectualized treatment overshadows the undercurrent emotionality of the characters. The subjectivity is there, but the root of it is missing.    So while the viewer is thankfully not lost in the convolutions of the film's mechanics of dreams, even when they blossom into layers after layers of intricate and florid abstractions, as sacrifice, the undermining of the individualization of the characters makes for a rather cold intellectual cinematic experience. Mind you, \\"Inception\\" is great cinema, but in that clean-cut, deeply concise manner; thus, a rather tame realization, as it completely misses the opportunity to really delve into the primal and raw realm that is merely glanced at during its exploration of the deep burrows of the subconscious mind. In other words, like a beautiful dream, but upon waking up, one ends up losing the profoundness and mystery of it, and instead merely comes up with a technically elaborated analysis to compensate for the failed attempt at grasping the metaphysical and grotesque intangible beauty of the dream itself. The film sports a dream chemist and a dream architect. Nolan should have included a poet or a philosopher.    \\"Inception\\" is neither as cerebral nor deep as it should be, and it could have been, if Nolan could have only have taken the time to take the concept of dream in its actual incarnation: wholly subjective, cathartic, nightmarish, emotional, intimate. One deeply misses the haunting murkiness of memory loss and the emotional and existential discourse as its results in \\"Memento\\". This is intelligent, ambitious, occasionally brilliant filmmaking, but it is too efficient, too caught up in its exposition, perhaps even afraid to slow down for the mainstream, that it misses the mark on being a completely visionary, abstract, transcendental work. Ironically, \\"Inception\\" as a film about dreams, makes complete sense, which unfortunately seems to render dreaming pointless.

B0038M2AZA|5.0|This is an absolutely well done and quite inspiring movie. It isn't sentimental and Claire Danes does a superb job as Temple Grandin (in fact, I didn't even recognize her at first) as does David Strathairn as the integral teacher who helped Temple transition from home to school and also advocated for her when other teachers were skeptical.<br /><br />It is worth noting, early on, that viewers can opt to hear the actual Temple Grandin, not the actress, describing her reaction to every scene of the movie. We watched it both ways and each has so much to offer. Temple's reaction to the movie is very engaging. Now more about the movie....<br /><br />Claire Danes,in her role as Temple, shows how challenging every part of life could be for someone with autism,from childhood on. I hope this one goes far to help people understand the enigma that is autism and to stop fearing someone who looks and acts so differently. I am especially in awe of how the director and actors didn't sugar coat the realities of autism. I watched this with one son who asked, \\"What is wrong with her?\\" and came away from the movie with a new understanding of autism.<br /><br />Every part of this movie reveals a new challenge for Temple and that makes it riveting. She has trouble adapting to the smallest changes. She doesn't like to be touched. Going through doors, especially automatic ones, is terrifying. Other students in college tease her. Again, Claire Danes shines in her role, never breaking character. This movie belongs in the library of anyone who has an autistic child, teachers of special ed students and anyone who wants to watch a superb film.<br /><br />However (and I still believe this movie deserves a 5 star review), I have a few quibbles, minor ones. I do think both parents of autistic children and others need to realize that Temple is what is called \\"high functioning.\\" Even so, she might never have gotten so far without the support of her mother and others who weren't put off by her behavior.<br /><br />But not every autistic child can do the same, in spite of their parents' best efforts, in spite of the best treatments possible, in spite of thinking outside the box. If this movie causes people to feel that every autistic child can - or,even worse, MUST -reach Grandin's level, then they don't realize that research into causes and treatments for autism are still evolving.<br /><br />Everyone wants those with autism to succeed and be accepted but parents of an autistic child should never feel guilty if their child doesn't become as successful as Grandin. As long as it doesn't induce that kind of guilt, the movie stands on its own as a portrait of a very remarkable woman.<br /><br />This movie is inspiring because it shows that some autistic children can learn to function in \\"our\\" world even though they see the world in a very different way or as the Temple of the movie says, \\"Different ....but not less than.\\" What an apt way to describe what every one of us who has or knows an autistic child would wish!<br /><br />Since autism covers both high functioning and low functioning children, the prognosis for some autistic children is not necessary as hopeful as that of Temple Grandin. Temple became a respected expert in livestock behavior. Some autistic children may not get that far, through no fault on anyone's part.<br /><br />I have some experience with this. We had a child who was called \\"autistic\\" even though we didn't adopt him until he was older. He rocked, flapped his arms, didn't seem too engaged with people, etc. However, his \\"autism\\" was caused by being raised in an institution for 5 years. Now he behaves like any child his age. At the SAME time, others who were adopted at his age never grew out of their autistic behavior. They remained locked inside their minds even though their parents tried every bit as hard as we did to help those children. Their children are still diagnosed as autistic and behave no differently than many autistic children. They do not engage with other people. They rock. They have tantrums if anything in their environment changes.<br /><br />Point being: the brain is mysterious and so is autism. Whatever its cause, it has varying degrees of severity, depending on the child. So by all means, watch this move and be inspired by it. But do not take it as a promise that any child with autism will become a Temple Grandin.<br /><br />I plan to have several copies of this one, some to hand out because the movie is simply that wonderful.hey do not engage with other people.

B002VPE1OS|4.0|I'm not sure why anyone finds these films hard to put on your screens. Just have your wife do it.     She had no problems at all getting the film on each of our iPhones. No bubbles, no debris, just a nicely protected screen. I was hesitant about buying \\"Amazon Basics\\", but the quality was surprisingly decent and I would definitely purchase this brand again. I can't imagine one brand of film being any easier (or difficult) to install than the next. Just take your time and use a steady hand. Or have your significant other do it for you.     Rated 4 stars simply because I believe the clarity could be better, but I'll chalk that up to it being anti-glare. It's probably better than the super cheap stuff you can buy for a penny, and as good as the real expensive ones. Three quality films for $12 isn't bad really.

The author's background in physics is close enough to my own field that every insight into graduate school and the subsequent career path translates into my own experience nicely.  Dr. Feibelman gives a great rundown of the motivations of professors you may choose to work with during the various stages of their own careers and how that will affect their students for better or worse.  Topics such as what sorts of projects to take on during your postdoc position, pros and cons of university labs verses government labs, obtaining funding, setting up your own lab or research area, and what interviewers are looking for prove very helpful insights into academia and will allow the student better preparation for each stage.  It's a quick read, insightful, with an honest look at the sometimes contradictory forces of the academic environment.  I highly recommend this book for anyone pursuing PhD and pursuing a scientific career.

B002ZG97RY|4.0|Although this Matt Damon movie is about the WMD we didnt find, that I believe were there and moved a while before 2003. It makes President Bush's claim and all of the other countries claims look wrong. I understand where Matt is comming from. I know his view and his politics.  Though I do not agree with Matt  I have to give him credit for being involved with such a good action flick.  That is why I bought it ,for the action and it fits the bill for me
0312360266|1.0|In this book, the first volume of the House of Night series, vampyres are all around us in the world, they are not just myths, people really know of them.  A tracker will \\"mark\\" someone who is meant to join this world, and they become a fledgling, a vampyre in training if you will.  This is what happens to Zoey one day at school.  Suddenly abhorred by her supposed friends and family (except for her grandma) she makes her way to the House of Night and her new life.  Will she survive the Change?  Why is her Mark different?  Is she a freak or destined to a special calling?  Of course, what would a book about teenage life at a school be without the \\"getting off on the wrong foot/creating an instant enemy\\" storyline?    I enjoyed the major storyline in this book, it has the potential for something I would love.  People being \\"marked\\" and going through a change while learning the ropes at the House of Night School.  However, this book takes place within a really short span of time.  It seems to me that the events that transpired, the relationships that formed and the conflict that happened should have developed longer.  Some may comment that it is a young adult book.  Well that brings me to two of my major problems with this book and my stating that this shouldn't even be classified as young adult.  There is way too much vulgar language and sexual content present to make me even think of allowing or recommending this book to the target audience (9th grade and up).  I will not allow my 14 year old to read this book.  The characters are frequently dropping the F-bomb amongst other vulgar language.  Ironically, we then read of characters saying things like \\"poopie\\" and \\"easy peasy.\\"  And the repeated mention of a certain sexual act is uncalled for.  I actually was trying to give this book a chance, I did read it all the way through.  But I continued to have an uneasy feeling about the spiritual references, magic with Native American culture, pentagrams, goddess references. Iwould have been okay with this as being part of a fantasy world, like Harry Potter and Twilight.  While other Christians take issue with these books I feel they are works of fantasy that also had some great morals to teach and lessons to learn, with great writing I might add and just a little childish bad language occasionally.  It seems to me that the writers of the House of Night series are out to promote some sort of pagan religion/idolatry, bashing Christianity as they go, while using the vampire theme as it is popular right now.  Seems the rituals and spells referenced, etc would be better suited for a book on witchcraft.  The authors are constantly bashing/ridiculing Christianity (or the People of Faith).  No, they don't say \\"Christians\\" but references within the book point to Christianity:    A certain group saying the pentagram is evil p 140  Uncomfortable pews in church p 141  People falling asleep to boring church services    And they are glorifying idolatry  pentagrams stand for wisdom, protection and power p. 140  \\"I'd never heard stuff like this in church before, and I sure as h--l had never felt so energized there, either!\\" p148    These are some of the references I remember, but there were more.  Seems they have a bone to pick with Christianity. They state in different ways in different parts of the book, that the \\"people of faith\\" want to control everything.    All in all, as I reread my review, I realize I have changed my original rating,which was a two, to now being one star.
0374532281|5.0|Meaningful...yet hilarious! Don't let this first novel pass you by. I have an interest in books that take the reader through struggles of family life. Quick does an outstanding job in writing about a family's journey and he achieves it through the backdrop of their intense love for the Philadelphia Eagles. I've never been to Philly but I imagine there are a few fans that share this same intense love for the Birds! This book will stay with me forever!
B003LL3NOK|4.0|Survival of the Dead mainly takes place on an island in the waters off the North American shores.  A sort of civil war has broken out over what should be done with the dead.  One family wants to put the dead back to rest, while another family wants to co-exist with the dead (family dead or alive).  The story finds the soldier from the National Guard in \\"The Diary of the Dead\\" film and follows him and a few other soldiers as they are caught in the middle of this war and are forced to witness what can be the only hopes for the survival of the dead, while trying to ensure their own survival.

0440214041|4.0|Another fantastic novel by Mr. Grisham. Plenty of twists and turns to keep the reader guessing and the action keeps you turning pages well into the night.
B00280LYHS|5.0|i thought this was an awesome end to the series. i liked this book because it kept me entertained and always wanting to read more. my favorite part was when nico came riding out of the shadows on mrs. leary and with hades and an army of skeleton soldiers. i would recomend this series to anyone who likes a good series with action, comedy, fanasy books and just a bit of romance. it is an easy read that would only take about a month unlike others which can tke a lot longer.
0142000671|5.0|A beautiful story written by a master, but don't be mistaken that it's all butterflies and rainbows. There are plenty of vulgar phrases and disturbing themes.
B000025XKM|5.0|I hear his music creep up in commericals & I think about what joy his music can bring, but then, immediately, I am reminded of his melancholy words with the haunting tones.  What a wonderful range of emotions!  Each one reaches deep into the soul and leaves you either feeling fulfilled or empty - a beautiful emptiness
0440245915|5.0|This has got to be my all time favorite Grisham book. No punches pulled in this one. Get ready for a wild ride.
0545123283|5.0|I Love, love, loved this book. As much as I liked the first book in the series, Shiver; it actually pales in comparison to Linger. The story read as if it were being played in my mind like a musical score. The emotions that were translated were gut-wrenching and raw. The story is a more realistic (if that can be said about a book with were-wolves) depiction of trials and tribulations that star-crossed lovers could and might experience in a similar situation.<br /><br />All the things that annoyed me in the first book, like Grace's parents semi-neglect and absent role in their child's life were not an issue. To tell the truth they kinda bugged me with their sudden interest and desire to be an active part of Grace's life. But, I really can't complain since that was my only real critical beef in Shiver.<br /><br />The introduction of Cole (*sigh*) as a new narrator and a major figure in the plot- was done perfectly. He is such an interesting damaged and tortured character. He brings so much contrast to the male presence in the story that it really enhanced the over-all plot. Cole's relationship with Isabelle is drawn flawlessly and allowed readers to follow more than just the love between Sam & Grace. It was so great to get to see new sides and perspectives of each character!<br /><br />I really cannot say enough good things about this book. I didn't just read the pages, I felt them. And, that is a true talent to be able to write that kind of feeling into young adult fiction. I cannot wait to see where the final book in the trilogy takes us. The author has planted several small bombs that she might choose to set off in Forever. One thing is certain...with Maggie Stiefvater behind the pen, her readers need not be worried-they are in excellent hands! Yes, Maggie Stiefvater is the kind of author I aspire to be some day. She is incredibly gifted and seems to be having fun writing the kind of books she wants and not taking herself SO seriously.
0399156577|1.0|Nora Roberts used to be an automatic buy for me.  Not anymore!  Her last several non series books have been unbuyable for me, and were at least readable until this one.  I couldn't finish, I found it cluttered and when it wasn't talking about dog training it was the typical plot of most of her recent books.  It's like she finds the same few plot hooks and rotates them, then adds in different settings.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|There has been much comment about the original music being changed for this release. Truth be told, I would not have even noticed had I not read the reviews. My only complaint is that the series stopped after five seasons. The best thing that ever came from MTV IMO. It almost even makes up for Beavis and Butthead (ugh!)  Five stars for me!
0143118420|2.0|After reading this book then reading others reviews I decided to participate and write this review. If this book was not given to me by a close friend I would not care to comment or give this book a second thought. However it was a gift and I was asked how I liked it. For this reason and because of it's enormous popularity and soon to be movie stardom I will share my thoughts. I am not angry nor upset by the book but simply amazed that anyone sees this book and it's author as anything more then a very self indulgent individual who is so self focused she can only write about herself at a very shallow level. Life, love and happiness, is based on self love but not on self indulgence. A person needs to understand self love in order to love others and provide compassion and share love. In my opinion this book and this womans continuous search for her self indugences are truely sad. She will never find that which she is desparately looking for. Her next book should research the expressions \\"Eat to live\\"  ... not \\"Live to eat\\" and she may find what she is looking for. just my 2 cents.
B00127RAJY|3.0|Saw this at Target yesterday on sale for less than $9.  Amazon's price has continued to go up while retail price has gone down - what's up with that?
B0036TGSR6|4.0|The ghost writer is truly a ghost writer, trying to write the autobiography of a former British prime minister, who is obviously Tony Blair.  The first ghost writer was murdered. In reading the first writer's manuscript and looking at his pictures, he finds that there is group of men who trace back to Cambridge college days.  The PM was one of them. Pierce Brosnan plays the PM and does so ably.  However, it's a good thing Ewan McGregor was aboard this film as the lead, the ghost writer.  I think a lesser actor would have been lost. This is because he is on his own for so much of the movie. He also is trying to solve most of the mystery at the core of the movie, which is: was the British PM an American stooge from day one of his political career? He does so in large part by shuffling papers, pictures, and clicking away on a computer.  This can be some pretty dull stuff in the wrong hands.<br /><br />This is Roman Polanski's film.  It is NOT his \\"China Town\\" mystery by any means. I think Polanski is trying to emulate Hitchcock's work in this film but the result is not as successful as a Hitchcock film.  However, it is a good film with an interesting premise and Ewan McGregor is one of my favorite actors.<br /><br />One warning: although this is a mystery film, I would not call it an action film.  If you are into the thrills and spills of an action film, this is not that kind of film.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B000003TA4|5.0|This album changed the world, and is my favorite in a collection of over 1000, so I felt the need to adjust the mysterious 4 star average. I'm sure there are better reviews out there, but if you are on the fence I strongly suggest you buy it, even on the offchance you might have the opportunity to harvest the astronomical energy contained within.
B002ZCY7SW|4.0|I liked all the seasons of 24 and I will get the DVD so I can see the continuous day as opposed to weekly.    But what about the dead guy that Dana shoved into the build in bookcase in the conference room?  He must be pretty ripe by now.
0060245867|4.0|The item was shipped promptly.  When it arrived, I was a little disappointed...  The book I received has a smaller, solid green hardcover, without the cover art displayed on Amazon (not that this is necessarily the seller's fault).  After keeping the book for a few days, I've decided that I like the version of the book I was sent.  The book is in decent condition, definitely used by a child (as is evidenced by Crayon scribbles), but without any distracting flaws.
B001JNNDBA|4.0|I won't attempt to review the movie since many others have already done that. I'll just say that it was a reasonably interesting movie to watch and I feel like I got my money's worth .. will probably watch it again at some point. I got a great deal on it here at Amazon and as usual, shipping was prompt and it came in good condition. I'm satisfied with the purchase overall.
B001SO69IY|2.0|I'm a huge Redman fan and I love Meth, and after Blackout, I thought I was in for something special. This was nothing but a flop. I never got the feeling that Red and Meth were really feeling it as I listened to the tracks. Both rappers are best when they are raw and uncut. I fell in love with both Redman's \\"Red Gone Wild\\" and Meth's \\"4:21 - The Day After.\\" Both are true classics, while Blackout 2 seems orchestrated and rigid. They should have renamed it because it doesn't come close to the quality of Blackout 1. \\"I'm a Dope N****\\" has a nice beat and \\"Dangerous MC's\\" rocks, but I was hard pressed to find the duo's usual catchy hooks anywhere on this album.
1595825045|5.0|This, along with the \\"Art of Kung Fu Panda,\\" is one of the very best Art-of books I've ever seen. It's thorough, insightful, and inspirational. A must-buy for any fan of animation.
B002ZG997M|4.0|Walking into The Book of Eli, I didn't really know what to expect aside from the fact that it's set in a depressing post-apocalyptic wasteland, and it features Denzel wielding a big knife and doing cool things with it. If that's all the movie had been, I probably would have been more or less entertained by it. But no, the movie goes above and beyond the call of duty, and for a movie about a book, it's a pretty solid film.<br /><br />What stuck me most about this film is probably the unique direction and world-building the film does. It's never really told what caused this apocalypse, but this post-apocalyptic world is kind of a beautiful world. The color has a very distinct tone to it, and even though the film mostly takes place in the California desert, the landscape seems very alive and striking. Watching Denzel just walk in front of a broken interstate towering above him is just a cool visual. And since the world is set 30 years after the apocalypse, everything looks it. Roads have a cracked, but dry quality. Cars are rusted, the paint on houses are peeling, and door hinges easily give way. Also, the world, at least as it shows, show society as reverted back to Western times. It's not really overt, but there's certainly the distinct feel of it in the scenes of the town. In fact, my biggest problem with the movie is that they didn't go deeper into the world. I want to know what it was like before. What was Denzel like before all this happened. Was he in the condition that he was in before it happened? You can see a K-Mart name tag with Eli's name on it at one point, but other than that, the movie is very specific in its scope. I just loved what they did with it so much, I wanted to see more of it.<br /><br />Also, I've never see The Hughes Brothers at work before, but they have a great visual style. And it's not just the color either. It's the shadows, how they light the fight sequences, the camera angles, what you can hear, when you can hear it, and how it's emphasized. I usually don't notice these technical details when I'm watching a film, but Eli certainly makes it stand out, for the better I think. Certainly, all the crew have promise, and I hope to see great things from them in the future. This includes a special shoutout to screenwriter Gary Whitta, who has never done a movie before this, but comes out with a splendid script for his first effort.<br /><br />But that isn't to say the movie is perfect. I could predict about 75% of the plot fairly easily, and I didn't have much love/use for Mila Kunis until she started blowing crap up. Still, by the end of the movie, they had convinced me that Meg Griffin could in fact be a believable bad-ass. There I said it. I thought it was impossible, but Eli showed me otherwise. Speaking of which...<br /><br />Denzel really is one of the, if not the highlight of the movie as the mysterious, but still thoroughly bad-ass Eli, who has a penchant for cutting off heads with a very sharp blade in the shadows. But it's not just the blade, as Eli is also impressive with a gun. Denzel pulls all the aspects of the character off with ease and coolness, while still being wise as all get out. Also, Gary Oldman is back in full form, channeling the slimy villainy he ruled over in the 90s. The character is a bit too serious, but Oldman makes the best out of the character.<br /><br />And then there's the end. A lot of people won't like it, but I like how it isn't the typical ending you'd expect from a movie like this. Is it believable? It's certainly a leap, but it works for Denzel's character, and makes him an even greater character. Plus, everything is wrapped up pretty nice, so I'll give it that too.<br /><br />Overall, atheists beware, this is a well-done movie that shows promise for everybody involved creatively. It also shows that Denzel is not without hope, Gary Oldman can still be slimy, and Mila Kunis can actually be cool. It's a surprisingly good movie and a satisfying one at that.y don't notice these technical details when I'm watching a film, but Eli certainly makes it stand out, for the better I think.

B002ZDOXLW|4.0|After the death of her fiance, Loreena McKennitt went into retirement for several years. But when she returned, she came back in a big way -- \\"An Ancient Muse,\\" a haunting little album filled with Middle-Eastern grandeur and Celtic bittersweet beauty. In other words, McKennitt picked up where she left off, and the years have not dulled the richness of her music.<br /><br />In a way, the album feels like it follows a day all across Europe and the Middle East. It begins with \\"Incantation,\\" a slow sunrise of a song filled with murmuring vocals and dark sweeps of strings, before segueing into the lazy half-lit twangs and angles of \\"The Gates of Istanbul\\" and the peppy sand-swept ballad of \\"Caravanserai.\\"<br /><br />Then McKennitt moves into colder climates with the wistful, string-soaked ballad \\"The English Ladye and The Knight\\" (all about a lady in love with a Scottish knight -- cue tragedy), the swirling \\"Kecharitomene\\" and the painfully lovely \\"Penelope's Song.\\" With the final leg of the album, she drifts into the twangy Eastern European flavors of \\"Sacred Shabbat,\\" the lush twilight tones of \\"Beneath a Phrygian Sky,\\" and finishing with the soft lulling beauty of \\"Never-Ending Road (Amhr&aacute;n Duit).\\"<br /><br />\\"An Ancient Muse\\" is only nine songs long, but it's one of those albums that feels like a full meal once you've finished it. There are a couple songs that aren't quite brilliant all the time (\\"Sacred Shabbat\\" just didn't grab me), but overall McKennit picks up where she left off in the late nineties -- lush multi-instrumental music laced with angelic vocals, flavored with the mystical.<br /><br />Her music brims over with silky strings, piano, guitar, keyboards, harp, angular accordion and earthy drums, as well as more exotic instruments like the bouzouki, the oud, the Turkish clarinet, the tabla and the lyra. And she evokes some truly spellbinding music with those instruments -- she can bring to life misty forests, Turkish marketplaces, colorful nighttime dances, and stately medieval processions. Although, I heard hints of \\"The Mummer's Dance\\" in a couple of the melodies.<br /><br />Her voice is also incredibly lovely, rich and angelic in all the songs she sings in. Her lyrics are similarly rich -- she seems to make nature itself into a light-filled temple (\\"The sand was shimmering in the morning light/And dancing off the dunes so far away\\"), even as she often sings of yearning and lost love (\\"And in the night when our dreams are still/Or when the wind calls free/I'll keep your heart with mine/Till you come to me\\").<br /><br />It took many years for Loreena McKennitt to make a full return to musicmaking, and \\"The Ancient Muse\\" is a short but good reminder of why she was worth waiting for.

030745455X|5.0|The late Stieg Larsson centered his Millennium Trilogy around cruelty towards women -- and the second of the trilogy, \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire,\\" is a tightly wound thriller that is almost as good as the first. It lacks some of the raw, wild, dark energy, but it tangles together some razor-sharp social commentary (sex trafficking) with a plot centering on Lisbeth Salander.<br /><br />A year after \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo,\\" Millennium magazine has a new reporter -- Dag Svensson and his girlfriend Mia are doing reports/books on sex trafficking and prostitution. At the same time, Lisbeth Salander has returned to Stockholm, and is cybereavesdropping on Mikael and Millennium -- only to discover an all-too-familiar name in Mia's sex trafficking report. Zala.<br /><br />Then Mikael finds both of them shot dead in their apartment, and Nils Bjurman -- the cruel \\"guardian\\" who raped Lisbeth -- has also been murdered.<br /><br />Lisbeth is the only suspect. But Mikael firmly believes she didn't do it -- especially since a hostile blond giant is going around beating up anyone (a trainer, a casual girlfriend) who might know Lisbeth's whereabouts. As Lisbeth goes on her own dark mission, she tells Mikael that he should look for someone named \\"Zala\\" -- but it turns out this mystery man has ties to Lisbeth's own dark past.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander was something of a mystery in \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" -- we knew she was troubled, a brilliant hacker, and had been in a psych ward. But \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" rips away all that mystery and shows us where Lisbeth Salander came from, and how she became a lonely, punky avenging angel. It's pretty nasty, and it ends on a cliffhanger (for crying out loud!).<br /><br />The biggest problem with this story is Larsson's story feels more scattered and hard to follow. But his style is still brilliant -- gritty and grimy, with lots of unpolished fighting, bloody violence, and some moments of sweetness (Lisbeth visiting her elderly ex-guardian). The most disturbing parts are undeniably the glimpses of Lisbeth's past, as well as the brutal descriptions of the sex trade (a man raping a girl to \\"train\\" her).<br /><br />And it's all wound around more unpleasant aspects of modern Swedish society, centering on cruelty towards women -- sex trafficking in a modern country, and the evil \\"Zala's\\" ability to get away with anything he wanted.<br /><br />And while Mikael is still a major force in this book, the spotlight is on Lisbeth, especially since Larsson sketches out a backstory for her (including a brain-damaged mother, her boxing skills, a twin sister, and so on). She's all half-healed hurts, wildcat energy and avenging dark angel mentality -- and there's something weirdly hypnotic about a character so completely outside the lines of \\"normal\\" society.<br /><br />The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" doesn't have the spark of the first book, but it still has an electric brilliance and scathing social exploration. Just be sure to have the third book on hand by the time you finish.most disturbing parts are undeniably the glimpses of Lisbeth's past, as well as the brutal descriptions of the sex trade (a man raping a girl to \\"train\\" her).

0199536597|5.0|No lover in the world ever wrote a valentine more exquisite than Virginia Woolf's tribute to her lover Vita Sackville-West.<br /><br />That tribute was \\"Orlando: A Biography,\\" a magical-realism tale about a perpetually youthful, charming hero/ine who traverses three centuries and both genders -- and Woolf's writing reaches a new peak as she explores the hauntingly sensuous world of Orlando. It's one of those rare novels that transcends the time in which it was written, even as its hero/ine transcends gender.<br /><br />Orlando was born a young aristocratic man in the time of Queen Elizabeth I. When the dying monarch visited his home, the charming young lord became her new court favorite (and briefly lover). His passionate, curious personality attracted many other women over the years -- until he fell in love with Sasha, a mercurial but faithless Russian princess (supposedly based on Sackville-West's ex-girlfriend Violet Trefusis). Bereft of true love, he devoted himself to poetry and entertainment.<br /><br />But then he's assigned to be an ambassador to Constantinople, and something strange and inexplicable happens. While a bloody revolution rages all around Orlando, he sleeps for a full week... and wakes newly metamorphosed into a woman, who cannot be expected to fight. With the same mind and soul but a female body, Orlando sets out on a new life -- and discovers that women aren't quite as different from men as she once thought.<br /><br />\\"Orlando: A Biography\\" is a very weird book, and was even more so when it was written since \\"magical realism\\" didn't exist as a literary style in 1928. Virginia Woolf makes no explanations about Orlando's immortality or unexpected gender switch. It's simply accepted that once he was a man, and then she became a woman, and that s/he has lived from the Elizabethan era until at least the 1920s (and who knows, maybe Orlando still wanders among us?). That mystery, ironically, saves it from seeming trite -- it's just a mystery of the inexplicable universe.<br /><br />And Woolf's writing is at its peak here. Her prose is soaked in luxurious descriptions that constantly tease the senses -- silver and gold, frozen flowers, crystalline ice, starlight and the exquisite expanses of nature's beauty.

0312539525|5.0|I get nervous on a step ladder so I can hardly imagine climbing a mountain. Maybe Archer didn't satisfy the real climbers out there but I just wanted to be entertained and I was. For me it was informative to learn how much trouble climbers go through to even approach or attempt such a feat. I'm sure there are zillions of books out there on mountain climbing and equipment blah blah blah to more than satisfy the nit pickers.  I wasn't looking for detailed accuracy just a good, engrossing story.
B002ZG997M|5.0|It's not that offten after I watch a movie that I say I will buy it. Well this is one of them. I wasent to sure about it I just expected lost of action wich I got, but what I didnt expect was a great story that was moveing and draws you into the movie. I highly recomend.
B002ZG997C|3.0|Impressive lineup of stars, the story is ok but the execution is weak, no care for details, Eli (Denzel) had clean cloths for 30 years? even if you go taken cloths from the dead that are in better shape than yours they are still at least 30 years old right? there is a scene where he is wearing a white t-shirt that looks like is been dry cleaned. The girl (Mila) had waxed eyebrows and eyeliners, I know is Sci-Fi movie, a fictional future, but if you are going to \\"pretend\\" to be somebody or to be in a specific time or era, do it right. anyway is ok for entertainment not worth buying, just rent it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Okay, so Ill admit, th Hunger Games was really good but slightly dissapointing. Catching Fire redeemed what was lost in the ending of the Hunger Games. sort of. It was all there, with amix of rebelling and more Games, but again the ending dissapointed us, and Peeta lying about their marriage and the baby was almost pointles... Anyway, I recommend this book and regret that I won't see Katniss and Peeta metor tributes. Can't wait for Mockingjay to come out!
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|If you haven't played final fantasy seven then you might not see whats so great about this movie, but visually its still very entertaining.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book will blow your mind! When an unfortunate incident forces Katniss to volunteer to participate in the gory Hunger Games, a fight to the death set up by her evil government, she is forced to rely on her instincts and hunting skills to survive her epic fight against 23 other tributes. While facing hard decisions concerning allies and who to kill, she must figure out the difference between friend and foe, all the while trying to show the Capitol that she is not just a object in their games, that she is a human with the strong will to survive, no matter what it takes. I most definately recommend this book. I enjoyed it, from the suspensful parts to the sweet ones, and I can't wait for Mockingjay!

B001OQCV2E|1.0|It's hard to elaborate on the deservedly scathing reviews 2012 has<br />received; it's not only physically implausible, but it indulges in the<br />worst kind of racial stereotyping. And naturally, it's the Americans<br />who run the show and get to survive for the most part. We're meant to<br />identify with a self-centered family group from Southern California<br />that indulges in soap opera dialog with each other even as their<br />friends and neighbors (even eventually their good-guy stepdad) are<br />slaughtered. The only thing that's supposed to matter to them is<br />\\"family.\\" The African-American President's wife is dead as is the<br />mother of the African-American scientist protagonist. The fact that the<br />middle-aged black women are dead before the movie even starts speaks<br />for itself since there's a lot of discussion about who \\"deserves\\" to<br />survive the catastrophe. An elderly Tibetan woman gets to live (even<br />though she doesn't speak English, a major character flaw in a film like<br />this) because she can virtuously save the white protagonists (who<br />probably wouldn't do the same for her if the tables were turned). The<br />CG effects are dramatic, but pointless because they're designed to be<br />sensational and nothing else. There's a protracted water scene (that I<br />fast-forwarded over) at the end of the film that is somehow supposed to<br />do with re-uniting the John Cusack character with his petulent son. The<br />earth has been destroyed, the majority of the world's population has<br />died an agonizing death and we're supposed to care about this?<br />Eventually the (mostly white) survivors set out to repopulate the lone<br />inhabitable continent, Africa. Colonialism begins again. Every single<br />moment of this film is truly and bizarrely bad.
B000B5OD4I|4.0|Classic design, comparatively accurate (mine is gaining about 5-10 seconds a day, depending on storage position) and a thrifty choice. Much to my chagrin, I get a lot more compliments from strangers on this watch (who presume I spent an order of magnitude more) than any of my far pricier watches. Originally, I bought this as a daily beater to alternate out with my solar atomic G-Shock but it quickly replaced it as my primary casual wear watch.    One star off because the jubilee band that comes with it feels pretty cheap band with hollow links. I personally dislike the jubilee style anyway, as I find it too gaudy, so I planned on replacing it with a NATO strap from the outset, which looks quite sharp with the Seiko.    In conclusion, while you won't be impressing anyone who turns their nose up at anything less than a Patek, the SKX007 offers good looks and functionality at a screaming deal - just don't expect the factory bracelet to be Tiffany.
0307454541|4.0|The first 150 pages and the last 100 pages are relatively slow and straight-forward.  The roughly 350 pages in between are some of the best mystery genre I've read.  The characters, Lisbeth and Mikael as well as the whole Vanger family are well thought-out.  I also enjoyed the fact that the book ends rather tidily allowing for people who didn't enjoy it to decide if they want to continue on with the rest of the series.

All of these are characters in the movie, and I'd like to add to the list of characters...The Composer.  Zimmer and his score on this movie are absolutely a crucial element in the overall experience of this movie.  Others have already described all of the individual tracks in detail, so I'll just add my two cents and state that this is a fantastic work that should win the Oscar for best 2010 film score.

B0006J28BO|5.0|Underlying this charming little film is a young girl's coming-of-age story. Helmed by Ghibli animator Hiroyuki Morita (and yes Miyazaki is also involved in it as the executive producer), the story centers around Haru (voiced by Anne Hathaway), a young teenager who feels like she is a misfit at her school, with only one really good friend. There's not much backstory as to why Haru does not fit in with her peers, but before long, Haru finds herself embroiled in some peculiar goings-on - she rescues a cat from being run over by a truck and to her amazement, the cat thanks her verbally! That same night, Haru is visited by the King of Cats and his entourage, and is informed that she will make a good daughter-in-law for his son, the Prince of Cats.<br /><br />Reeling from this encounter, Haru discovers to her horror that the cats mean business when she arrives in school to find some bizarre 'gifts' - hundreds of wrapped presents containing live mice! Haru then hears a voice that asks her to find The Cat Bureau, and makes her way to a store (with the aid of an overlarge white cat named Muta) where she meets an elegant and charming cat named Baron von Gikkengen (Cary Elwes). The rest of the story focuses on the Baron's attempts to rescue Haru after she is kidnapped by the King of Cat's henchmen and kept prisoner in the Cat Kingdom.<br /><br />I loved the underlying theme which addresses self-esteem and trying to find one's 'voice', universal themes which many adolescents struggle with. My five-and-a-half year old daughter might not have appreciated nor understood this theme, but she loved the rich visuals (plus it helps that both of us adore cats!). It is a story that can be appreciated by both young and older viewers on different levels. There is some violence involving battle scenes between the Baron, Haru, Muta and the King's cats, but these scenes are not gory or bloody. In my opinion, this animated feature is suitable for ages 5 and up, depending on the maturity level of the child. \\"The Cat Returns\\" is charming with an engaging plot and interesting characters. I plan to watch [[ASIN:B000CDGVOO Whisper of the Heart]] which I understand features the Baron in it.of the child. \\"The Cat Returns\\" is charming with an engaging plot and interesting characters.

B001N26GFM|1.0|This truly, from a historical standpoint, is one of the most ridiculous movies I have ever seen.  From this movie I learned the following \\"facts.\\"  1.  Auschwitz is apparently in Germany.  2.  Auschwitz except for one barrack, didn't have very many prisoners.  It also wasn't very crowded.  3.  Apparently, except for one fly buzzing in the background, sanitation wasn't that bad.  4.  Prisoners were of a healthy weight.  5.  Except for in the barrack, there were literally no guards.  6.  Auschwitz had no guard towers.  7.  If you wanted, you could chat with prisoners of Auschwitz anytime you wanted just be walking up to the barbed wire.  8.  Full grown men were gassed and young children were gassed only when they accidentally got mixed in with the full grown men.  Otherwise, young children were okay.  9.  If you wanted in to Auschwitz, simply dig a hole under the fence and nobody will mind.  10.  There were only men in Auschwitz and no women.    I could go on and on with the ridiculous historical inaccuracies, but those are my top 10 problems.  If you are looking for a movie that romanticizes history, then you are fine.  It is a movie that can make you think about the ending.  However, since most people don't know enough about the Holocaust already, I worry that they are going to take this movie to be fact, when it is nowhere close.

B002ZG997C|4.0|\\"The Book of Eli\\" is one of those mini-epics where the hero is regaled for his relentless quest to achieve one compelling aim in life.  Denzel Washington gives a great portrayal of Eli who is consumed with verbally recreating the last Holy Bible in the world into book form.  Denzel's mastery of martial arts and firearms comes off a bit uncoordinated, but you can appreciate and give dramatic license to the attempt.   \\"The Book of Eli\\" is reminiscent of \\"V for Vendetta\\" where the hero commits his life to destroying the tyranny of England, which has become a world power--once again.  The similarities are uncanny---the doting young woman who comes to worship the hero for his courage, consolidated power in the hands of one man, and a legacy reborn following the triumph and death of the hero.    The ending of \\"The Book of Eli\\" did not have the grand finale of \\"V,\\" because it attempts to turn the disciple into a post hero---which is not a good idea.  Great heroes emerge from conditions average individuals take for granted. There is a level of sensitivity endemic in an individual who longs for and finds a life's calling, which is not easily transferable, no matter how inspirational.  The gift of remembrance and a commitment to excellence is the purist and most authentic homage one can give to the hero.  Hollywood, in all its glory, loves to tantalize audiences with the possibility of a series of characters who become \\"Eli.\\"  If everyone could become Eli, where is the specialness?    I recommend watching \\"The Book of Eli\\" and \\"V for Vendetta\\" to embrace and celebrate the possibilities of the human spirit.    Edward Brown  Core Edge Image & Charisma Institute
0316017922|1.0|This sexist self-help book combines the usual folksy, inspirational stories with pseudo-scientific analysis to arrive at some self-canceling conclusions:  First, exceptional men are not really exceptional.  Second, if global politics were utopian, we could all be just as exceptional as they are!    Gladwell avoids defining success but hints heavily at his own hackneyed values----riches, power, fame, and awards, especially the Nobel prize.  Barring utopia, he advises that one should hope for lots of good luck in birth, biology, and life circumstances, while working doggedly on a marketable skill from kindergarten on up, in case opportunity ever knocks.  If it does, be prepared to abandon scruples and become a shameless opportunist.    Throughout the book, the author implies that math scores on standardized tests reliably predict all things bright and beautiful, but he never states that presumption directly, much less defends it.  Given that he never defines \\"success,\\" either, he avoids presenting any coherent argument to justify the book's existence.    In the penultimate chapter, Gladwell wholeheartedly embraces the corporate-sponsored Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP) available in some ghetto middle schools to boost academic achievement.  He characteristically avoids examining broader facts or associated moral and sociopolitical issues that might negate his rosy conclusion that harder studying is a surefire way to guarantee a better life.    He also avoids addressing any of the unregulated capitalist abuses perpetuating U.S. poverty, or the corporate cynicism behind funding ghetto schools with a narrow curriculum, in order to perpetuate a slave class.  Instead, he takes KIPP's own advertising at face value and concludes that brutally intensive schooling at the expense of all play time and adequate sleep is completely justified.  He further betrays children by suggesting that their parents can sidestep urgently needed socioeconomic reforms by browbeating them and scheduling away all their free time.    Gladwell is clearly dazzled by the good life and his own success as a popular writer.  He pretends to offer a formula for others to follow in his footsteps, even as he admits a low likelihood of their doing so, because so much of \\"success\\" relies on good luck.  His own biggest stroke of luck seems to have been in finding a publisher who thought he had something worthwhile to say.
B002G1X350|3.0|The lead singer is easy on the eyes and the photographer is doing a fantastic job of telling a story with the cover art.   The music ... it's not bad; Liv is a talented singer and the the rest of the band are competent.  In the end their work reminds me strongly of Sarah Brightman's Symphony, but Njord and Vinland Saga lack the energy, production values, and passion of that album.  It may not be a fair comparison but listening to those to albums had me start playing Symphony as I write this review.

0307454541|4.0|A good, worthwhile read but it has some violence images. Once I got into reading it, I found it hard to put it down. Here is a brief summary of the plot:<br /><br />One of the two main characters, Mikael Blomkvist, is an investigative journalist who had recently been convicted of a libel conviction and the resulting sentence was 90 days in prison.  The conviction related to a story he did about a prominent Swedish businessman.  He is contacted by an elderly member of one of Sweden's wealthiest families and asked to investigate (for an obscenely large sum) the disappearance/murder of the man's beloved niece, Harriet. Harriet disappeared or was murdered about 40 years ago as a teenager. To aid him in his investigation he hires an odd young woman, Lisbeth Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo.  Lisbeth's story is the main focus of the trilogy.  He uses his investigative skills and she uses her computer hacking skills to figure out what actually happened to Harriet.  Along the way they uncover some ugly facts including the work of a serial killer.

006145205X|5.0|The basic premises:<br /><br />(1) In the course of human history, people have lived increasingly prosperous, comfortable lives. This statement might seem surprising at first, but only because of the common tendency to paint the (unexperienced) past in rosy hues. On closer examination, the average inhabitant of a modern country lives a life kings of the past would envy.<br /><br />(2) The drive behind this ongoing improvement is trade, both of goods and ideas. Not charitable works or government regulation, necessary though those might both be in certain circumstances.  No, people left to their own devices will find clever ways to solve pressing problems, bettering themselves, their customers, and often the world, in the process.<br /><br />(3) Given (1) and (2), the current climate of DOOM is not well-founded.  Yes, we *might* be doomed, but there's no particular reason to assume that mankind can't handle whatever challenges lie ahead, using our rapidly-increasing capacity for idea exchange. However convincing current predictions of DOOM may be, there were equally convincing predictions in the past, and they all turned out to be wrong.  Sure, there were occasional setbacks and issues, but overwhelmingly, life in the modern era has continued to rapidly improve, despite predictions of famine, plagues, ice ages, over-population, killer air pollution, acid rain, and much more.<br /><br />For me, the most fascinating parts of the book were about ancient prehistory of trade, and various historical trends and developments. Less interesting, though more controversial, are the later chapters about modern issues like global warming and poverty in Africa.  Though they're important topics, they're still largely theoretical on all sides.  No one knows how bad climate change will be, or what we will wind up doing about it.  No one knows yet if/when/how Africa will attain prosperity.  I'm more interested in facts than debate, though I realize the current-event chapters will get all the talk at cocktail parties.<br /><br />The only real weakness I perceived were the vague, unnecessarily inflammatory potshots taken at archetypes Ridley sees as enemies of trade: kings, priests, financiers, taxmen, monopolies, bureaucrats.  Whenever historical economic progress foundered, these generic targets get the blame, without much real explanation.<br /><br />I've heard criticism that Ridley is unreservedly opposed to governments and regulation, but that was not my impression.  I came away with the feeling that the right kind of government was absolutely necessary to prosperity, not no government at all.  He criticizes places like the USSR, modern-day North Korea, and 1800s Japan, while pointing out Botswana and Silicon Valley as places doing it right.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun, fascinating book to read.  Essential, IMO, for anyone who wants to discuss current events in a balanced way.  Whatever your stance, be prepared to have your own nose tweaked a bit, as Ridley is generous with his snark.<br /><br />Highly recommended.ies.

193413712X|5.0|Both back and front covers of this small but wondrous volume cite words of praise from Marilynne Robinson, who won the Pulitzer Prize herself for her novel [[ASIN:031242440X GILEAD]]. The comparison is apt. Both Robinson and Harding write with exceptional beauty. Both share their awe at the richness of nature and the simple detail of everyday life. Both are religious writers in the fullest sense, not by any means confined to the inclusion of preachers among their characters. Both write of fathers and sons. But while GILEAD and its companion volume, [[ASIN:B002N2XHU8 HOME]], are clearly novels, TINKERS occupies a rather different genre, more like a scrapbook or fictional memoir than a continuous story. Certainly there are plenty of brief anecdotes contained in it, and the reader automatically strives to fit everything into a normal timeline, but there is no overriding narrative connecting beginning to end and providing momentum throughout the whole. For me, this is the book's only weakness as a novel (perhaps 4.5 stars?).<br /><br />An old man, George Crosby, lies dying. A former teacher, he retired to make an even better living repairing old clocks, tinkering with them for profit and amusement. His father, Howard, had actually been a tinker, traveling the back roads of Maine with a horse-drawn cart, fixing pots and selling household items. Howard's father had been a preacher of rambling sermons drawn from the example of nature that eventually rambled their way into total incomprehensibility. As George lies in bed, memories of his own life merge with speculations about his father, and take flight from there into histories that he could not possibly know. What emerges is a strong sense of the unpredictability of human life, the meaninglessness of conventional measures of success, and the strange links that bind members of a family through the generations, even as sons strike out in a totally different direction from their fathers. Harding punctuates his writing with excerpts from an imagined 18th-century treatise on clock building, as precise in its detail as imaginative in its style, and a series of prose poems on aspects of nature, Thoreau out of Robert Frost. You read for the variety and vision of Harding's writing, for his sense of domestic simplicity and cosmic scale, and for the edgy but very real New Englanders he brings to such brilliant life. But you have to give yourself entirely into the author's hands; this is not a book you read for the story.from an imagined 18th-century treatise on clock building, as precise in its detail as imaginative in its style, and a series of prose poems on aspects of nature, Thoreau out of Robert Frost.

While the idea of a global blackout may seem far-fetched, the writing is done so well that you would believe it is actually possible.    The mix of twists, action and just good story-telling makes this a must see!

I saw these guys open up for Radiohead and Tom Yorke gushed about them. Rightfully so.  If you like Hootie and the Blowfish or Jack Johnson you will hate this album.  This is a piece of art.

B002ZG981E|5.0|BLU-RAY:<br /><br />I just finished watching Inception for the second time. The Blu-ray is amazing. The PQ and AQ are perfect in every way. I did notice that the video was not as sharp, crisp, or clear as The Dark Knight. However it was very, very good. The audio is very bass heavy, but is up there with some of the best Blu-ray AQ I have heard. The movie was stunning all the way through and after another watch it is just as good if not better than the first time I watched it.<br /><br />The special features are great. Disc two is full of behind the scenes and a dream documentary by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. On the first disc there is expansion mode which takes you behind the scenes and shows you each special effects scene and all which went into creating it. It is really interesting to watch. Very little CGI special effects were used on this film. They actually did most of the stunts or build huge models. It was really cool to watch.<br /><br />MOVIE:<br /><br />I went into Inception thinking very positive and with high hopes that this will be one of my new favorite movies. I based this simply on the trailer. I was not let down in the slightest, and I was blown away by the originality and creativity of the film. The directing, acting, and cinematography were all amazing. It is a beautiful film.<br /><br />After seeing Inception I will have a hard time watching any other movie ever again. Anything else would seem boring and useless. I went to see The Expendables in theaters. Horrible. I couldn't understand what the interest in this film was. It was just violence and explosions; No story or plot. Just useless violence.<br /><br />I can see where people may think of Inception as something similar to the theme of the Matrix. It sort of has the same basic idea of people being hooked up to a machine, leaving their bodies and going somewhere else. Besides that, there wasn't much at all which reminded me of the Matrix. Each scene held its own new originality in the most creative way as possible.<br /><br />As far as Inception being hard to follow... well, I had no trouble following it at all. The three friends and my eleven-year-old brother had no trouble following it. I believe people who are more open minded would follow and understand it much better than people who are not willing to believe the story. Parts are incredible to believe, but you have to be open and let the story take place.<br /><br />The creativity and attention to each shot and scene really paid off in the end. The film was perfect in every way in my opinion. Things were done which we have never seen before and it was done so well. It has set a new standard for films, at least in my mind. The directing style is similar to The Dark Knight, however they seemed to give Christopher Nolan more creative freedom with Inception.<br /><br />The acting was top notch. I liked that Leo's character, Cobb, seemed a little weak minded at times. Usually he plays a strong character, but in this film his character had a weakness. Joseph Gordon-Levitt played a larger role than I expected. I was impressed with his character as well. Most of the crazy stunts, anti-gravity, jumping off walls and fighting people in mid air kind of stuff were with his character. Very cool. Ellen Page played a young architect which is hired to build cities within a person's mind. She did a great job as well. Each character was so well thought out and everyone added just the right amount to perfectly blend each character into the story.<br /><br />If you're a fan of films which touch on subjects which most movies dare not go, you owe it to yourself to see this film. You won't be disappointed. I am very glad I got to see it on the big screen.<br /><br />Video<br /><br />Video codec: VC-1<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br />Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1<br /><br />Audio<br /><br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />French: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Portuguese: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />French: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Portuguese: Dolby Digital 5.1 (less)<br /><br />Subtitles<br /><br />English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese<br />English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese (less)<br /><br />Discs<br /><br />50GB Blu-ray Disc<br />Three-disc set (2 BDs, 1 DVD)<br />Digital copy (on disc)<br />DVD copy<br />Bonus View (PiP)<br />BD-Live: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />French: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Portuguese: Dolby Digital 5.1 (less)<br /><br />Subtitles<br /><br />English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese<br />English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese (less)<br /><br />Discs<br /><br />50GB Blu-ray Disc<br />Three-disc set (2 BDs, 1 DVD)<br />Digital copy (on disc)<br />DVD copy<br />Bonus View (PiP)<br />BD-Live

B003UOQMGO|1.0|I love Sting but this muck is truly awful. It sounds like the worst of the Moody Blues who always felt compelled to add a lot of syrupy orchestral preponderance to so many of their otherwise good songs. Sting should have gotten George Martin to help him put this together as ole George knows how to be sparse with an orchestra-- using it to enhance a rock song without weighing it down. I'm really surprised Sting would even release this. Instead of Symphonicities they should call this SCHLOCKonicities. You'll need a shot of vinegar to get rid of the saccharine aftertaste of this misguided effort.

0307269981|3.0|I had read so much about these books, I bought and read this one. A good, enjoyable read. Nothing outstanding. Maybe it's me, but I don't get all the excitement generated by these books. Perhaps the untimely demise of the author has given these novels an extra \\"something\\". As I said - good read - but don't be surprised if you are disappointed (given the hype).
B002VPE1B6|1.0|I see blue people. (sorry, couldnt resist)<br /><br />Ok, I was disappointed in this film. I didn't care about the alien race at all, their stupid tree house, or their tree of souls. (I would've shot a nuke at those) Visually it looks nice, as expected it should, it did have the largest ever budget, right? I didn't like the classic GI Joe Army dude, the crippled marine jerk, or the modern day Jurassic park jungle. The \\"love story\\" w/-in the film was dumb too. After watching this it doesnt surprise me that it lost to Hurt Locker at the oscars.<br /><br />I like the beauty of Earth much better, \\"pandora\\" just seems too artificial/unbelivable. Floating mountains? ...really? So where are the unicorns and my lucky charm leprechaun? Apparently it is a black light glow party every night there, I get this is science fiction- Cameron just went over the top w/ it IMO. It's also predictable, for example, you know the main character is going to fly that mega red bird at some point, that he's going to fight back against the big bad American force and prevail, and that the alien girl will meet the real jake sully. The length is a bit much too I felt. It doesn't have much beyond some very expensive slick visuals & the battle scenes were few and not very impressive either. What's w/ the squid like pony tail tips? gross. He didn't actually say that metal they wanted was un-obtain-ium did he?<br /><br />\\"I see you\\" 1 star :)
B002ZG980U|5.0|I have to start this review by saving if you haven't seen Inception yet -go see it. Seriously, if you haven't seen the movie stop reading this review now, get your butt down to the local theater and see this movie. I'll wait....    Okay, seen Inception? Yeah, it's pretty freaking awesome. It's hard to say much beyond \\"genius,\\" but I'll try. Honestly, Inception is one of the most intelligent movies I've ever seen that still manages to be thrilling, surprising and downright amazing. Most importantly, in an industry flooded with sequels, remakes, reboots and movies based on already-existing properties, Inception is actually original (shock). I know the advertising campaign tried to play it off as a mix between James Bond and The Matrix, which it kind of is (by a stretch), but Inception feels more like a high-budget indie film than anything else.    In the world of Inception, the technology exists for individuals to break into others' dreams, create environments so they can \\"extract\\" certain information, typically an idea. Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is one of the best Extractors in the business, but after an extraction fails, he and his team are on the run from the powerful entities that hired them. However, an unexpected person offers Cobb a free ticket back home -and back to his children -if he can invade a certain person's mind and, rather than extracting a idea, plant one so deep and convincing that the person believes they thought of it themselves.    Inception is as epic as the plot seems. From the beginning writer/director Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight) throws viewers into an unforgettable and fascinating world where dreams and reality blur. Though the viewer is left clueless for the first 15 minutes or so, the introduction of Architect Ariadne (Ellen Page) offers a much-needed exposition dump and moves the plot into the complex web of a throughly thought-out, intelligent and fairly scientific examination of the human psyche and the shades that torment it.The special effects are pretty awesome too -somewhat reminiscent of The Matrix, but so strange yet familiar that they felt just like dreams should. One thing about the special effects that I really liked is the fact that there was very little CG, a Chris Nolan signature. Rather than being assaulted by very fake-looking CG, everything, especially the weightless scenes where characters are floating through the air, look real.    Dare I say there are flaws? Well, maybe a few that some of the dissenters out there cling to -but that's being super picky. For me those flaws are length of the film and the lack of back story for any of the supporting characters. While I admit the length isn't too bad (a swift two and a half hours) I did kind of wish that I could pause the movie and take a few minutes to stretch a bit and well, let me my digest some of the epic awesome that was unfolding on screen. But as for the lack of back story for the characters aside from Cobb -yeah, that's a bigger deal. Since so much time is dedicated to what's going on in Cobb's mind that the other characters were thrown to the wayside somewhat -but I admit, I didn't even notice this until after the movie was over. While, of course, there will always be someone out there who dislikes certain movies, etc., I find it hard to believe that people could downright hate it.    Easily one of the top films of the summer, possibly of the year or even the decade, Inception is an amazing piece of original cinema that should set a new standard for innovation in Hollywood.

B001OQCV6A|3.0|Guy Richie wanted to change Sherlock Holmes character and thats fine. A stuffy Holmes isn't as entertaining. The movie itself was entertaining, but was lacking in several areas. The villain Blackwood seemed out of place to me and more fitting for a Raiders of the Lost Ark movie. Rachel McAdams should stay with the dark hair, thats her best look and she's gorgeous in this movie.   I don't think the movie conveyed the brilliance of Sherlock Holmes very well. It did show some of his masterful observation skills at times, but for people not familiar with Sherlock Holmes, this movie doesn't really portray him well. Even though I liked Downey Jr in the part. The movie tried to show his brilliance in some scenes, like getting the flies to fly in the jar counter-clockwise - but that was a pretty lame attempt, more like something a school kid might come up with. So the reason I give it 3 stars is because of that. Holmes was the master of observation and deduction. His favorite saying was \\"when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth\\".
B003LAH7MU|4.0|Let me start off by saying that it is refreshing and extremely pleasing to listen to the new take on Roxanne. Even though that classic has been played and re-played over and over again, it was an amazing and incredible experience.  As for the rest of the repertoire, there are some memorable highlights and some disappointing lows.    The highlights are by far, The Pirate's Bride, The End of the Game, We Work the Black Seam, Englishman in New York and the rarely played I Burn for You. Those songs were just amazingly executed and their arrangements were just incredible.    Word of advice to the incredulous:  When listening to this record, one has to remember and consider that these songs have been re-worked through the years. Sting himself has stated in the past that almost inmediately after putting out a record he feels the need to rearrange his compositions, so it should not be a surprise to anyone the fact that he did decide to re-record his classics and some of his most intricate works. This is not, by any chance, a greatest hits album or a simple compilation of his classics. This is an altogether different thing.  It is a great record, and something that was a long time coming.  Good job Sting!!!
B000OCY7JE|3.0|A man who works with children at an Indian orphanage (Mads Mikkelson) is called back to his native Denmark to meet a mysterious man (Rolf Lassgard) who is willing to contribute a large sum to the financially strapped institution on the condition of a face-to-face meeting.  This sets the stage for a number of surprises.    The magnificent cast earns this film its three stars.  Their work is so powerful that they elevate even the most contrived circumstances.  However, they are really let down by director / co-writer Susanne Bier, who has fashioned a manipulative story that is pure soap opera.  She also has an annoying visual style that is most exemplified by lots of close-ups of eyeballs and lips.
B001NEK2GE|3.0|Its a great product BUT the ergonomics are a bit off b/c you can not adjust the height...meaning the keyboard had a downward slope instead of the normal upward slope like all normal keyboards.

0545123275|4.0|This is not really a review. But i did LOVE the book, and a friend of mine is in Chicago and is going to buy me Linger! Yay! But well, Maggie,if you are reading this, i have an opinion for the colors of Forever: It could be Gold with.. uh.. brown? or yellow. or whatever you like. But it would look great in gold! And I was thinking of red too, but i don't know.. SOUNDS GOOD, does it? Because which other color would it be left? BLACK for a title Forever? DON'T THINK SO. or PINK?! nah. that would be TOO GIRLY. BUT purple would be nice, though, but I still vote for Gold, cause it looks more ethereal, magical.. FOREVER.. jeje. But well it's her decison, you know.. but well BYE!

B003E88TKS|4.0|I thought this movie was very entertaining and also took a very real look at several modern life issues. Just like real life the ending is not a fairy tale, but is somewhat satisfying in its own ways.<br /><br />Like many of us in real life the main character goes through a series life altering events only to circle back around to where we started, but hopefully a better person<br /><br />Definitely worth a watch, at least a rental.
0393072231|5.0|I am in an investment group and The Big Short was required reading for each member of the club. By the time I was half way through the book, I could not put it down.    Chapters 1 and 2 are interesting and set the groundwork for the people you will need to know. However, chapters three and four were so full of unfamiliar vocabulary and the building of a very complicated scam on the public, that I could only read a few pages at a time. Underlining as you go is helpful because you will need to check back often to remind yourself who was whom and what was what.     I came away with no faith that our government is capable of protecting us from those who wish to screw us; the oversight agencies are a joke. Additionally, the rating agencies (upon whom we lean heavily for guidance on the risk element of securities and bonds)hire the weakest of the weak anaylists and do not dirty their hands with hard digging for the facts. Wall Street is as crooked as everyone has always claimed and they (Wall Street) need oversight in the worse way. I am normally against too much government looking over everyone's shoulder, but these guys on Wall Street need minute-by-minute monitoring. They are incapable of honesty. Brokers who sold CDOs were lazy as well; little homework was obviously performed before offering these tragic bonds to their customers. The CEOs of Wall Street firms must not be able to sleep at night knowing they allowed their employees to work in an environment that allowed cheap, dirty tricks - albeit, brillant.And to think that they were selling these worthless pieces of junk to customers while trading credit defaults and betting against them. What has happened to honesty and character?    Michael Lewis is a gifted author based soley on the fact that he is able to take an unbelievably complicated issue and explain it in terms that us common folks can understand.

031236198X|5.0|In Our Iceberg Is Melting, Harvard professor John Kotter and co-author Holger Rathgeber tell the story of a colony of penguins who are facing change. The story is written in fable format similar to Who Moved My Cheese by Spencer Johnson.<br /><br />An astute penguin named Fred observes that the iceberg the colony lives on is melting and that they will face potential disaster if it breaks apart in the middle of winter. He proceeds to present his findings to Alice, a member of the leadership council. Once the need for action is realized, there is no small amount of squabbling amongst the council as to next steps.<br /><br />They eventually determine to let the rest of the colony know of the great risks and solicit ideas for solutions. After arriving at a creative solution through interactions with a seagull, they implement a migratory initiative to seek out new icebergs. The change is not without detractors who question the findings and argue for maintaining the status quo without addressing the risks of the melting iceberg. However, through strong leadership of the head penguin and a small action team, the penguins drove efforts to eventually relocate to a safer home.<br /><br />The story has multiple examples of personalities seen commonly in organizations. There are those who are interested in arguing for the sake of arguing, the cautious, the hard driving but consensus building leaders, the creative but sometimes ignored penguins, the naysayers, those being academic in mindset but who ask tough questions, and those who just want everyone to be happy, among others.<br /><br />Kotter and Rathgeber use the story to demonstrate an eight step process of successful change which includes:<br /><br />1. Create a Sense of Urgency<br />2. Pull Together a Guiding Team<br />3. Develop the Change Vision and Strategy<br />4. Communicate for Understanding and Buy In<br />5. Empower Others to Act<br />6. Produce Short-term Wins<br />7. Don't Let Up<br />8. Make It Stick<br /><br />The book is fun, has great change management principles, and can be read in no more than an hour or so. While change for change's sake is not necessarily wise, for those in any organization facing challenges, this book provides easy to understand concepts for managing change.n no more than an hour or so.

B0006B29Z2|5.0|When it comes to live performance, you won't be disappointed with Iron Maiden. These 2 dvd sets clearly show how this great band develope their reputation from small club performances through sold out massive concert performances. It's really interesting to see and hear how great Dianno's (Live at Ruskin & Rainbow) and Dickinson's (Live at Hammersmith)vocals as well as other members' raw energies in those early days.   Definitely a must have dvd for all Iron Maiden old and new fans.
B0018AK9RA|5.0|I grew up on the \\"harder and/or heavier\\" rock of the late 60's early 70's and on through 2010. I was first introduced to JP on the \\"Rock-a-Rolla\\" album. and have been a fan since. Change is good for a band whom have been going over 15 - 20 years. It keeps them from becoming stale and if some of the later releases aren't as well recieved as the older stuff you've got them, the older stuff to play. That being said, I believe that JP releasing their first \\"concept\\" album is a new shot into some GRANDFATHERS of METAL. I've since become a grand-father since first listening to them, and don't listen to the younger metal bands of today. But my kids, and grand children all listen to this album because of some of the reasons I've stated. That being said whether your an old Priest fan or a younger one. I really do belive that most all ages will really enjoy this release if given the proper time all will like it.
B001FB5634|5.0|Very powerful movie.  I have never read the novel on which it is based, but must say that this movie was very touching.  The relationship between the father and son is strong and the instinct for survival despite extreme hardship is also strong.    This movie is about what it takes to survive -- even in a world where life is brutal.  At first I wanted to stop watching, but I'm glad I stuck it out.  Some parts made me wince - for example, the underground bunker where human beings were being stored and hacked apart as food.    The ending, while hopeful, was not necessarily happy in my opinion.  So, in that sense, this movie is quite realistic since real life is not always happy.    Ignore the naysayers and watch it at least once.
0609610570|4.0|I've bought this book because all of my professional life has benn devoted to getting things done.  The contents of the book, as far as I've gone trough it, are very satiscfatory and provide both confirmation to my experience and a very good systematization of the subject.  But the issue I'd like to highlight with this review is that I've bought a used copy of the book, defined in the ad 'as new', for a very cheap price and the ad was....completely true.  I've got an almost brand new hardcover copy of the book!  A recognition to the professionality and organization of the seller.    Ettore Cambise  Rome, Italy
B001C4AFOY|5.0|yes, it was a slow moving movie, but it picked up steam, not like a volcano, but more like someone figuring out what was the right thing to do.  I'm no anglophile, but this movie made me admire someone in that horrible fishbowl that was royalty and still do what was right and still find the love of your life.  When the movie ended, I was sad, I wanted it to last longer.  Emily Blunt was sublime and made me appreciate her as an actress as never before.
B0037QO8RK|1.0|This movie was a total and utter waste of time and money.  I have no clue why this movie has received so much attention or any awards for that matter.  The acting was only so so (at best) and the plot was so over the top! If I could give it less than one start I would... maybe a half a start... maybe
B003LAH7MU|3.0|The good news.  Although some are better than others, in general songs 2 through 10 and 12 are very good.  The bad news.  Songs # 1 and 11 nearly wreck the entire album.  In the past 10 years many rock bands and rock artists music have been re-recorded by symphonies.  It just seems like something that has become quite popular.  Right now you can go out and buy \\"The Symphonic Music Of YES\\", \\"The Symphonic Music Of Pink Floyd\\", \\"The Symphonic Music Of Rush\\", \\"Queen\\", \\"Led Zep\\", etc.  The interesting thing is that they all turn out the same.  The slower and more melodic songs turn out to be, by far, the best and most enjoyable songs to listen to.  And sometimes they will take a song like Pink Floyd's \\"Money\\" and rearrange the song so that it is a lot softer and more melodic and record it that way to, which is great.  The songs that almost never work and suffer terribly are the rock songs that are faster and ones that they do not rearrange and try to record them as a fast rock song with the symphony trying to keep up behind it.  So is the case with \\"Symphonicities\\".  The first song is \\"Next to You\\", which is literally the first song off of The Police's first album.  It is a hard new wave punk rock song that does NOT belong on this album.  Same with song 11, a rock song by Sting from \\"Ten Sommoner's Tales\\".  You can almost hear the conductor having a coronary as he's trying to keep up with the pace of the two songs.  Not good.  Fortunately songs 2 through 10 and 12 are the slow melodic songs that sound great as a symphonic piece.  And they are fantastic.  The symphonic reworking of \\"Every LIttle Breath...\\" is so good it's almost worth the price alone.
B002T9H2MO|5.0|The character development is so strong that Sam Rockwell role has proved what a top level actor he is. This is one of those rare movies where you can connect with the character so much that you want him to be real, because while you're watching him he seems real. It's absolutely beautiful acting & writing.    The story is incredibly simple but it's presented in a way that it keeps unfolding itself throughout the entire movie. There is a twist, but the twist is early in the movie (which is rare). The rest of the movie is the character facing the reality of the twist, going through emotions & realizations that are gripping in a very subtle & true way.     This is not a thriller, it's not a movie you just watch for entertainment, it's very engaging. I cannot recommend it enough for people that enjoy quality story-telling.
B000000H64|3.0|My 2 cents on this band:<br />Machine Head + a bunch of synthizers + goofy monk like chanting.  If you think a band like Machine Head gets old super quick (like I do) be warned!  Those guys stomp this band into the dirt.<br /><br />Its all taste, a decent set of music but not for everyone.<br /><br />BTW:  Track 5 \\"New Breed\\"...is he saying \\"Food Fight?\\".  HAHA, hiliarious.
B003HARV98|5.0|This is one of those albums that you can play all the way through without wanting to skip past a track. Nothing bad from Marina.
B003N5VOUO|5.0|My Name Is Khan marks Fox's entry into Bollywood with their earlier attempts with Hot Summer Love in the Chinese market. However unlike Fox's counterparts Warner, Disney and Sony, Fox's entry is a serious commentary on race and religious relations in America. My Name Is Khan is a flim about life in America set in the events of recent history unlike the foray from the other studios which a feel good standard Bollywood fare. This is new ground for Shah Rukh Khan - this flim is not a musical, action flim or even a romcom - something we are familiar with SRK. American recent history told from the eyes of a person with disabilities makes this a Bollywood production with is different from the normal fare.
B002RKRTGO|1.0|The one-star review is solely due to the problems accurately reported by other readers.  There are critical passages early in the book (articles from newspapers) that are entirely missing from the Kindle version.<br /><br />The book itself is one of the best Sherlock Holmes stories.  In a complete version, it's a four-star book.
B000065KH2|5.0|This is a favorite of mine. I think most people would agree. The Amazon seller represented the product accurately. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase from them again.
B000XA5K48|5.0|I caught this on cable one day and then went out and bought the movie and watched it all over again.  What a blast!  The action is way over the top (think the first two Transporter movies) and the casting is brilliant.      Clive Owen is the reluctant hero who gets involved when he sees thugs with guns follow a very pregnant woman.  During the ensuing shootout, the woman dies and Owen is literally left holding the baby.  Owens lists the help of the gorgeous Monica Bellucci to help him care for the baby.    Paul Giamatti is brilliant as the the cold, ruthless, contract killer who is thwarted by Owen at every turn.  Contrast this with his role in Sideways and you come to appreciate what a great actor Giamatti is.  The subplot involving Giamatti's wife constantly calling to see when he is returning home to help celebrate her birthday is hilarious.  The rest of the movie involves Owen trying to piece together why Giamatti was hired to kill the baby and his mother.  Besides the humourous lines that Owens and Giamatti have, the plot is quite interesting, which makes this movie much more interesting than similar movies such as, for example, the Transporter.  The action sequences are over the top so be prepared to suspend reality and just enjoy the ride.  Highly reccomended.
0141321008|4.0|I picked this one up for the kids and ended up just reading it to myself one day because I had missed it in my youth. It really is a great story and is well told.
B003QNXPUK|5.0|This is my first Zagg and it definitely was a challenge to get the first side on. But I got the backside on in a pinch no problem. I was definitely weary of this using fluids and such but I am very happy with how it turned out. It keeps the shiny sharp look of the iphone 4 intact and provides a little extra grip. My phone bounces around in my pocket all day and I take it in and out often so it works great for me. It doesn't desensitize the screen to noticeably and I was used to it straight away. I already ordered another one for when this one flakes off(they all will eventually.)

B001TI7DG6|4.0|I enjoyed this book, although it was disturbing and truly haunted me. What was most haunting was the lack of closure, which was intended by the author (I can imagine), but without the closure that I typically get form a novel it was unexpected (in a bad way....)
1452896283|5.0|Dorian Gray: charming, innocent, youthful, and beautiful. So beautiful, in fact, that only the best artists can capture his charisma and perfection in a painting. When Dorian looks into the eyes of a portrait of himself, he is overcome with jealousy. Jealousy of the eternal youth and beauty of the masterpiece; youth and beauty which will one day vanish from Dorian Gray's perfect face.<br /><br />It is at this moment that Dorian makes a wish to stay beautiful forever, while the painting ages in his stead. However, his youth corrupts him, a corruption which can be seen on the face of his painting. Beauty, which was once Dorian's greatest attribute, may become Dorian's greatest flaw.<br /><br />Oscar Wilde wonderfully paints the story of The Picture of Dorian Gray. His simple language and sentence structures makes the story easy to read and follow, yet adds a certain level of depth to the plot. The character of Dorian Gray instantly captures the attention of the reader, and Dorian's development throughout the story provides a deeper significance to the novel.<br /><br />The Picture of Dorian Gray is a timeless classic, relating the tale of a young man whose wish to be forever young becomes the greatest mistake he has made in his eternal life.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|From the amazing special effects, to the story line, to break through 3-D technology this movie was awesome. Being able to see what technology has come to in film was amazing. I can't imagine I would want quite as much CGI and other technology in all of the movies I see, but this was a fantastic treat.   Absolutely STUNNING!
B000L43AN4|5.0|Orphans is one of the all-time great box sets and possibly Tom Waits' best release, which truly says much. It is essential for anyone even remotely interested in him and ideal for those wanting a starting point for post-Heartattack and Vine work. At three discs and 56 songs, it is a generous sampler of new and neglected work from roughly the last twenty years:  soundtracks, side projects, b-sides, and outtakes. The diversity of musical genres, lyrical styles and themes, voices, and instruments is nothing short of astonishing. More than half the cuts are new. Some of the others are given as they were made at the time; others are re-recorded and improved. One might expect such an album to be widely variant in quality and lacking cohesion, but this is remarkably not so. Orphans is on par with Waits' best albums overall and on a track by track basis. I figured that I would never want to hear a significant number of the songs twice, but this is true of only about half a dozen - quite extraordinary for such an album. Some tracks (\\"Bottom of the World,\\" \\"Lucinda,\\" \\"Road to Peace,\\" \\"Walk Away,\\" \\"Rains on Me,\\" \\"Never Let Go,\\" \\"Take Care of All My Children,\\" \\"Down There by the Train,\\" etc.) are even among Waits' best. The covers are particularly intriguing, since Waits has done so few. He makes them his own in a way rarely seen, rewriting some almost entirely, and the overall quality is very high. The cohesion comes from the sequencing, which ostensibly divides Orphans into three thematic discs, all of which are essentially albums in themselves:  Brawlers (rock songs), Bawlers (ballads), and Bastards (a miscellany of experiments, spoken word pieces, covers, instrumentals, and oddities). Some choices are questionable, and several could easily be moved from one disc to another, but the first two discs would be great albums in themselves, and the third is interesting as a whole while a few cuts here and there could add substantially to other albums.    Brawlers begins with \\"Lieto Me,\\" a shocking departure even for Waits, who sounds like a cross between Elvis and David Bowie. Despite having all prior Waits albums and being well used to his voice diversity, I first thought it could not be him and that I must have played the wrong album. But it is him - and quite excellent too. This gives a good idea of what is in store, though the ever-changing Waits never even comes close to repeating. \\"LowDown\\" is perhaps his most overt rock song and a very fine one. Other cuts veer more toward blues (\\"2:19\\"), folk (\\"Ain't Goin' Down to the Well\\"), faux-gospel (\\"Lord I've Been Changed\\"), ballads (\\"Sea of Love\\"), and more. Especially notable is \\"Road to Peace,\\" only Waits' second overtly political song, which deals with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; the singing approaches spoken word, and Waits somehow gets away with lyrics no one else would even think of using while making keen points. As all this suggests, the claim that Brawlers is his first true rock album is exaggerated, but it is the closest we have. This is nice in that we get to hear him stay uptempo more than usual but not so nice in that the writing is simpler and more repetitive than usual. Some may have wanted full-blown rock, but I for one am glad for the variety.    Bawlers is the standout, a masterpiece that would surpass everything but Bone Machine as Waits' best album. There is no weak cut and many great ones. The disc touches on nearly every kind of ballad, from lullaby (\\"Bend down the Branches\\") to Rat Pack (\\"You Can Never Hold Back Spring\\") to epic-sounding barnstormers (\\"Never Let Go,\\" \\"Take Care of All My Children\\"), and more. Many songs have Waits' usual excellent piano, and all have his supremely affecting voice. \\"Little Drop of Poison\\" and \\"Little Man\\" add some dark-edged variety, and Waits' take on the classic \\"Goodnight Irene\\" also mixes things up somewhat. Another standout is \\"Down There by the Train,\\" previously recorded by Johnny Cash in a very different version; we even get an extra stanza. Orphans would be well worth buying for this disc alone.    Despite a few great pieces, Bastards, as its name implies, is essentially fans only. It opens with a killer \\"What Keeps Mankind Alive,\\" letting Waits pay tribute to the Kurt Weill/Bertolt Brecht team that is one of his biggest influences; the song sounds so much like him that it is hard to believe he did not write it. As for other actual songs, we get, among others, his legendary version of \\"Heigh Ho\\" and two very different takes on a Jack Kerouac poem put to music. \\"Altar Boy,\\" a throwback to late 1970s Waits, is a pleasant surprise. \\"Two Sisters\\" is a funny traditional folk send-up. However, a good portion of the disc is spoken word. \\"First Kiss\\" is one of Waits' trademark spoken pieces with atmospheric music, but most of the others have no music and often nothing but voice. Anyone who has seen or heard Waits live knows that he could have been a comedian; his jokes are good and his delivery impeccable. He gets the chance to show this off in monologues ranging from bedtime story parody (\\"Children's Story\\") to a demonic recitation of insect facts (\\"Army Ants\\") to shaggy dog stories (\\"The Pontiac,\\" the hidden twentieth track, etc.) These are entertaining, even hilarious, though not necessarily the kind of thing one wants to hear often. Most other tracks - ranging from brief, strange instrumentals that almost seem intended to annoy or test patience to weird experiments of various sorts - are less successful, but the disc is still very intriguing.    All told, Orphans is nothing less than one of the best albums from the last twenty years, a lasting testament to Waits' continuing artistry.
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|Excellent movie! So well done, from the interviews to the video coverage. I think every doctor, health care worker, nutritionist, teacher, sports coach, personal fitness trainer, and parent should see this film. It would also be great for college students and maybe even high school seniors. In other words, I think nearly everyone should see this film. If more people knew where their food came from and how it was prepared, they would make different food choices, possibly improving their health.
B002KECK1G|1.0|Avoid this terrible \\"Collector's Edition\\". If you compare the quality of this DVD-R with the one of the Adam Curtis Documentals, \\"The Century of the Self\\", this one is garbage. The latter has a beautiful presentation on the box and on the discs. I have just opened the box of this 1984 version and the image of the Dvd is fading in my hands. As one of the other reviewers said: \\"the image quality of the movie is the same as youtube\\". Maybe this Company is making the transfer from youtube version to DVD (it looks awfull). If this Dvd is remastered I'm The Big Brother. I know it is an excellent movie, but I have paid $25.49 for this terrible DVD transfer. Come on, I have just bought all the Sherlock Holmes Collection, with Jeff Brett (16 dvds), in Amazon UK for 30 pounds = $46 dollars. I feel cheated, what a shame. Avoid it, believe me!!!!!
B002HWRYJE|1.0|I have to admint, I found the first scene was stunning and very emotional. The camera path was exceptionally well chosen - something new / fresh. The tragedy of new life given birth and the sacrifice to protect it was going very deep although there was no prior introduction of characters (probably has something to do with me being father of a 2 year old child -> accelerated identification :).    But then one disappointment followed the other. There was some self-irony which made me hope now and then that the movie would pick-up the pace of ST IV - until the destruction of Vulcan. Then I realized it was not a reboot of Star Trek but a re-format with a big middle finger sticking out of the dust cloud. Usually they warn you before all previous stored data will be lost - not here.    Well, all other things have already been said in previous 1-star reviews. No need to mention them here again. Only one question I'd like to ask:  There are really great books that pick up the story-line after Nemesis. Why do more timetravel non-sense and why not create a movie that is based on such great stories that were written by authors who actually know the ST-Universe and who know what ST really is about (discovery of new life and civilizations, principles, mutual respect)?    A recommendation for all disappointed ST-Fans: get the books from the \\"A time to...\\" and from the \\"Destiny\\" series and the ones in between (TNG). I despised reading ST books before that but after this movie-fiasko I was happy to read good stories and do some \\"healing\\". I read about 15 books in just 3 months. The other great thing about these books: They don't end after 45 minutes but last for hours! Really worth a try...
0553378384|2.0|This book is fine if you already have your chart done. You need to know where your South and North Nodes are located . While the book goes into detail, I found most of the traits described did not fit my personality. The book while well written, did nothing for me. It did not hold my attention. I think it is good for a person who wants to learn to read charts for clients-- it would give them plenty to say. However true or untrue.
B002VECM6S|5.0|In truth, I wasn't very eager to see this film.  I'm not much of a football fan, so a true story about an underprivileged kid being taken in by a rich family and making good on the gridiron didn't hold much appeal for me.<br /><br />Was I wrong!<br /><br />Football is NOT the main thrust of this story.  The film is more about faith and compassion -- and color-blindness.  Yes, I will take the title to refer to more than just a tackle protecting other players from threats they can't see.<br /><br />In fact, this story is so miraculous I almost couldn't believe it was true.  Leigh Anne Tuohy is obviously a remarkable woman and one of the strongest female role models I have ever seen in a movie, and Sandra Bullock embodies her with a performance that really did deserve the Oscar, even over the pitch-perfect Meryl Streep as Julia Child.<br /><br />As depicted here, the Tuohy's of Memphis are the very model of a proper Christian family.  When Leigh Anne sees young Mike homeless and alone, shivering in the rain, she doesn't hesitate to take him into her beautiful upscale home.  When it becomes clear that the shy and learning-challenged young man has no place to go home to, she welcomes him into their family.<br /><br />The scene at lunch is memorable, where Leigh Anne answers one of her well-heeled lady friends who questions why she isn't concerned bringing a large young black man into a home shared by a beautiful teen-aged white daughter.  \\"Shame on you!\\" Leigh Anne replies, and good for her!<br /><br />If only our country were filled with Leigh Annes instead of the so-called Christians who populate the Tea Party and continue to turn their backs on the homeless on every street corner!<br /><br />As a tutor the Tuohy's hire for Mike, Kathy Bates also makes an impression, warning them before they engage her, \\"There's something you should know about me -- I'm a Democrat!\\"<br /><br />Fortunately they hire her anyway, and she helps Mike improve his grades enough to graduate high school and earn a football scholarship to Old Miss, on his way to becoming a pro with the Ravens.<br /><br />My only gripe here is I wish the DVD had a director's (and star's) commentary.  I would like to know if the particulars of the story are all true -- was Mike really investigated by the NCAA to see if the Tuohy's had acted improperly recruiting him for Old Miss?<br /><br />Did Mike really start a fight when one of his old neighborhood acquaintances made sexual comments about Leigh Anne and her daughter?<br /><br />Did Sandra Bullock get to meet the real Leigh Anne to perfect her steely but warmhearted characterization?<br /><br />I hope that this deficiency will be rectified with a tenth-year anniversary DVD or such in a few years.  In the meantime, this remains a movie every family in America should see.y to becoming a pro with the Ravens.    My only gripe here is I wish the DVD had a director's (and star's) commentary.

Although his subject matter tends to dwell in the fantastic, you will be amazed at Paul's attention to detail.

B0039SFKSW|5.0|The BEST ASIA album ever! What's more is there to add? And with the added bonus of being recorded with today's standards!<br />Put together one of the top three singers, keyboardists and drummers, add to the mix Steve HOWE who hasn't seemed to enjoy himself as much since his days in YES and you get the recipe for an awesome and timeless album.<br />To those who wonder what the point is to release such a record in 2010, I would say that this is what Music with a capital M, is all about: the music and the musicianship! How many such records are released nowadays? I was listening to a web-based radio station the other day and I couldn't tell the difference between NICKELBACK (which I like) and countless other groups which all sounded the same playing the same chords all over again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Enough said, just listen and may the Lord of music have mercy on those who don't because they don't know what they're missing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0060899220|5.0|I love Anthony Bourdain and the man has quite a God-given talent for the written word. He is a world-weary traveler with a ton of great material, some of which he chooses to share in this book. He is always open, raw and funny, it is just who he is and he makes no apologies. If you read the book as it was intended, it is greatly entertaining and filled with insights. You can take or leave his advice if applicable but you do not have to be a cook, chef, waiter, or anyone remotely connected to the restaurant business to love this book.

B002VECLVO|5.0|Often a book and a movie share little more than the same name.  I've made several attempts at Isherwood's book.  Having now seen the movie, I will attempt the book again.  Yet, I can say that they differ.      I cannot begin the book without knowing that it is about me as I might be judged by another. I stop unable to bear reading a word more. Perhaps other readers have had the same experience.  I know that the book is about death--not the sudden culmination of life, but the slow process by which each minute of life is also a minute of dying, a dwindling away of whatever trivial presence we share with other living things as we lose the heart to go on.  On the other hand, the movie is about the death of another.  Only in its last minutes does Ford tell us that this movie is actually about the viewer.  In the main character, we see a reflection of ourselves; and, accordingly, realize we might have misjudged the protagonist.  Our hearts have hardened while the hero of this movie blindly and courageously just keeps stepping inexorably forward.
1573229725|5.0|Are you a Dickens fan? Did you read [[ASIN:1593082800 The Woman in White (Barnes & Noble Classics)]] by Wilkie Collins? Have you enjoyed Michel Faber's [[ASIN:0156028778 The Crimson Petal and the White]]? If so -- this is the book for you!<br /><br />Set in Victorian London and outlying areas circa 1862, the novel is the gloomy, grim, yet enthralling story of two very different girls whose meeting results in circumstances that change both in cataclysmic fashion. Sue Trinder, a fingersmith (pickpocket) lives among con men and thieves with an adoptive mother who takes in infants. Maud Lilly, heiress, lives a protected existence on a country estate with her bookish uncle and finds herself in need of a maid. The two are brought together by Gentleman, a scoundrel and rogue, in a dastardly plot to gain him Maud's inheritance.<br /><br />The novel is divided into three parts giving you the perspective of each of the girls. The third section is the conclusion, full of surprising twists and turns. The characters in London, the ones on the estate, and those in the lunatic asylum, are interesting and their plights are compelling -- some you will love and others you will hate. Or will you change your mind, once you understand their motivations and secrets?<br /><br />I really enjoyed this novel because of its setting and I liked the plot -- including the many times that I discovered that what I had thought was not what happened or when a foregone conclusion proved false! I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a complex and entertaining read with many layers. I have not read any of Sarah Waters' previous books, but will certainly rectify that now.<br /><br />PS -- The BBC adaptation (2005) of this novel was excellent!
B000000OF6|5.0|My husband was looking for this cd for a while . Finally we found it   delivery was quick!!
2839905809|2.0|They spent too much time on making a beautiful book and not enough time on fresh, new content. The website is great and I enjoy the blog but it also meant that the material in here was lacking. If this was a $10 I wouldn't complain but for the price it's not worth it. Also, the quality of the actual book itself wasn't what I expected for the price - my book was completely missing the binding.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|When this series first started up, I thought it was one I would skip. After it had been running a while, I heard it was very good, so tried out an episode from season one and got interested.<br /><br />I've now seen all of season one and REALLY liked it.<br /><br />As I told a friend of mine when recommending it. This tells the story of the era where we come from. I was born in 1960 which is the year of season one.<br /><br />Shall we say times have a changed a LOT since then. It is hard to imagine that things were as depicted, but they probably were - well, I suspect they exaggerate maybe a tad, but maybe not. Politically correct it is not.<br /><br />One thing is all the smoking. I mean, it is constant. And the drinking. And \\"bad\\" behavior.<br /><br />People think we live in a more enlightened time now and maybe we do, but still watching this show, I cannot help but feel that we lost something we need to find again in the process.<br /><br />If you can't remember the early 1960's, take a look. It does seem to be true to life setting wise. They did an incredible job there.<br /><br />Briefly, the show centers around a guy working in an ad agency in New York starting in 1960. He has a mysterious past which is explained late in the first season. He is a likable guy, but he has some big flaws - at least as we see things now anyway. We meet his wife and family in the series and people he works with as well as many colorful clients.<br /><br />Give this one a try.
B000002U9Y|3.0|I've got the cd marked as a 1994 release. Think my notes say that it would be good if the sound on the cd was brighter and more upfront. Anyway, this album is mostly mellow and has some continuity with their debut album \\"The piper at the gates of dawn\\". On occasion Wright and Waters do Syd Barrett kind of material. Syd was not a functional member of the band by this point. Album is pleasant and sleepy but the music and vocals tend to be feint. Like their debut, this album has the potential to grow on you more. However, I think that this album starts probably from a lower point and has less upside. Album runs to 39:27 minutes in length.        Best track - \\"(.)\\":      Set the controls for the heart of the sun - a very pleasant, dreamy track with a mellow vibe. Interesting for the drums. There may be the kind of drums you hear in symphonies. Nice texture to them in any case. Vocals are breathy. Glassy percussion too...xylophone, perhaps?      Best track, on second listen - \\">(.)\\":      Remember a day - another piece with dreamy vocals. Perhaps has touches of \\"Pow R. Toc H.\\" about it. Percussion uses tom-tom drums perhaps...something tribal in any case. Nice piano note melody. Notable track for drums and piano work.        The rest:      Let there be more light - opening track brings to mind their debut album. Lead guitar work, cymbals, organ reaching a crescendo.  Think my notes suggest that the lead guitar brings to mind The Beatles' \\"Lucy in the sky with diamonds\\".  The organ part brings to mind The Doors...not sure if The Doors had recorded by point or even existed yet. At first it's not clear if this track is in stereo. Sound could be crisper.      Corporal Clegg - has a sort of Black Sabbath type intro to it, although that band did not exist at this point. Song has a Barrett and Beatles' Sgt.Pepper vibe to it. Psych rock, nice drum tone. Lead guitar, churchy sounding organ. An instrument like a kazoo or something features.    A saucerful of secrets - comes in at a hefty 11:59 minutes in length.. An instrumental piece. Like the drum rhythm; organ; has a horror or thriller movie type score vibe to it...getting a bit UFO movie score later on. An instrument like a zither, perhaps, features, and the organ has a touch of the Hammond to it, I think. Whilst an instrumental, you do get some vocal notes performed. Piece has some discordant passages. Perhaps you could divide this tracks into three parts: 1) new agey sounds 2) tribal drum rhythms and 3) mysterious sounding music with vocals.    See-saw - another song redolent of Syd Barrett as far as the lrycis go. Mellow, acoustic guitar. Different percussive instrument used...a glockenspiel or some such. Piano and organ feature. Has backing vocals.      Jugband blues - Syd Barrett's only contribution to this album. Lyrics are apt by Syd...I actually wondered if the lyrics were not so much an artistic invention by Syd as a symptom of his declining mental faculties. Backing band sounds like The Salvation Army!        Recommendations:      Pink Floyd - The piper at the gates of dawn. It's similar to this album, but better for Syd's major contribution to it.    Pink Floyd - The Wall. Roger Water's album is excellent.

B0000797IO|5.0|I could watch The Good Girl over and over, every day, which is why I give it 5 stars. (Except I would skip the two sex scenes, especially the 2nd, which is painful to watch.) Part of why I love this, is you can make up your own mind about the ending, which shows Justine Last and her husband playing with their baby. But Justine got pregnant after she had sex with her coworker/lover, Tom \\"Holden\\" making you believe it's probably his baby, not Phil's (Justine's husband.) But it could be Phil's, because they had been trying to have a baby for a long time, prompting Justine to take Phil to a doctor to check on his sperm. Or, it could even be Bubba's, Phil's friend, who saw Justine cheat with Holden at a motel, and tells her she has to have sex with him, or he'll tell Phil. But Bubba isn't really a candidate for Justine's baby daddy in my mind. You can pick, because Justine denies it's Holden's baby, but sounds unsure when she promises Phil it's his baby.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a droopy, sad movie. Everyone is depressed, and everyone happy ends up dead. (A coworker, Gwen, who was about the only upbeat character, dies from food poisoning.) It is about Justine having to make choices, to be with her lover, or be with her stoned husband who cares for her, but is always high. Justine seems torn, but as she narrates her story, it seems she's made up her mind of dropping one of them.<br />The first time I saw this movie, it made me depressed, as all the character's were. That is why I like it, not because I like being depressed, but if a movie can make you feel a certain way you wouldn't have felt unless watching the movie, then it does a good job. This is my opinion of an effective movie, maybe not a great one, but effective at changing your mind about things, making you think, changing your emotions, or making you want to know more.<br /><br />I loved this movie, because while being depressed, it made me think about the horrible choice Justine had to face. This DVD also claims to be a romantic comedy, there are a few funny moments, but I would never call this a comedy. A story about a sad married woman, who loves her younger coworker, but can't leave her husband. If I were Justine, I would have chosen Holden most likely. But after I thought about it, they are only bonded and their relationship is where it is because they're both depressed, and that's it. They seem to share little similarities beyond depression and hating everything.<br /><br />So, I loved it. I own it, and I've watched it 3 times in one month. If you don't like being sad, or sad movies, or romance, or anything similar to the plot of this movie, don't watch it. But if you like the idea of this, sad movies, romance, and some spread around jokes (Zooey Deschanel is amazing in this!) then you'd like this.
1439165645|5.0|Beautifully written in a flowing narrative of distinct cultural voices. A story gently told but with moments of startling imagery. Writing from within a culture not one's own, and describing food - it's preparation and presentation - are both very difficult to do, let alone well.  Mr. Morais makes it natural. A marvelous experience.
030745455X|4.0|This book number 2 started out a bit slowly. Lots of big paragraphs of descriptions and events, and we don't really get to the meat of the story until about page 200. I was starting to get concerned! Book #1 was so riveting I couldn't wait to pick up #2, but I slowed way down when I realized I had to slog through a lot of unnecessary stuff at the beginning.<br /><br />I don't really want to say too much without giving anything away to those who haven't read it yet...but Stieg really keeps the reader in suspense for quite some time. Lisbeth disappears for a while, and I wanted to know where she was! This book had so many more twists and turns that I was gasping out loud. The ending was so abrupt it made me reach for #3, before I realized that my sister (from whom I borrowed the books) doesn't yet have #3...<br /><br />The characters are as strong as ever. Love Mikael Blomkvist. Love Lisbeth. Love the new characters that were introduced: Miriam and Paolo. And I especially enjoyed that Mikael seemed less of a ladies' man in this novel. The 1st one he was in bed with every female that walked on 2 legs, and in this 2nd one he seems more controlled.<br /><br />I am itching to read the third. Itching, I tell you! My boss has a copy, which he's lent to someone else. My sister stubbornly refuses to buy the hardcover (which I understand because paperback's cheaper) and paperback's not out yet. My local library has a waitlist that's the length of the Mississippi. Somehow I'll have to quell my craving...And I've heard tell of a #4 that Stieg was working on before he died. #4? Will the cravings never cease? ;)
B003F3NDWG|4.0|I just bought the 2nd season of \\"Castle\\".  I've only seen 1 of 4 DVD's but it's very good for those who love Science Fiction and I do most of the time.  I loved the first season.  I'm also a big fan of Henry Potter, so I'm seeing these Sci-Fi films from all sorts of unique ways.  I really like \\"Castle's\\".  It's for young adults and on up in age, those who are into letting their minds see what is presented by the director and freeing themselves to enjoy the unusal.  I'm able to enjoy most everything that's not real just because it isn't.  I loved all the \\"Star War's\\" and a near realistic \\"2001\\" and \\"2010\\".  Most people will enjoy these movies.

0307592839|4.0|The story begins in the late '70s California punk scene and ends in a near future where tattoos and piercings are outmoded and babies are proficient at text messaging. In the 50 or so intervening years, a set of characters drift in and out of the pages, their lives intersecting in often surprising but poignant ways. Brought together by music and concerned with personal expression, art and experience, the characters who populate Jennifer Egan's thoughtful new novel, A VISIT FROM THE GOON SQUAD, are all dealing with the passage of time and the effects --- positive, negative and neutral --- it has on their lives, beliefs and relationships.    Readers first meet Sasha as she lies on her therapist's couch discussing her compulsion to steal. From sunglasses to keys, expensive pens to scarves, she has an ever-growing collection of disparate objects taken mostly from strangers (never from stores). In her therapy session, she recalls a date, many years ago, with a man younger than herself. The one-night stand would've been forgettable but for an incident with a stolen wallet, her date's appropriation of one of her trophies and his memory of the night decades later.    We meet another central character in the next chapter. Bennie Salazar is an aging music producer who has a euphoric musical experience while listening to two sisters record a song in their basement while his son joins in on tambourine. The moment brings back for Bennie what he loves about music, but it ends in a humiliating anxiety attack and he is tended to by Sasha, who is, at this time, his assistant. Bennie's story, like those of the other figures in the novel, shifts back and forth in time. Next he is a teenage musician whose friend's inappropriate affair with music executive Lou Kline not only gets Bennie involved in the business end of music, but also introduces a whole group of other characters whose stories are entangled with Bennie, Sasha and their friends.    Some of these relationships are tenuous,others are confusing, and often the novel feels like a connection of interrelated short stories drawing from the same host of characters and themes. Yet Egan moves easily between stories and settings, and in time. We find Sasha as a young adult, in the midst of several formative relationships. Her best friend will soon be dead, and she is years away from the settled mother and wife we know she will become. We are also treated to a chapter told from the point of view of Sasha's young daughter, who explains her autistic brother's fascination with musical pauses in chart and graph form. Bennie emerges later in a second marriage confronted by the closest friend of his youth and an opportunity to make meaningful music once again.    There are so many characters here --- friends, children, business associates, the children of business associates --- that Egan always appears in danger of dropping threads. But that tension serves the story well because tension seems to be at the heart of it. We readers know what the characters don't: how it turns out and how time treats them in the end. We know who survives, who is radically changed, and who loses the battle against time. There are elements of satire here as Egan looks critically at journalism, the music industry, public relations and more. But even as she casts doubts on intentions and integrity, she is never mean-spirited. In fact, the characters she creates are sympathetic. Because we see some of them as children or young adults, we have a sense of what brought them to the point where --- for example, after witnessing their mother try to improve the image of a genocidal dictator with a fuzzy hat and a hug from a down-on-her-luck starlet --- they would attempt to manipulate public interest in the music of a reclusive janitor through guerrilla text messaging.    If it all sounds convoluted, it is and it isn't. A VISIT FROM THE GOON SQUAD is complicated and complex, but because it addresses some of life's big questions, itis philosophically compelling and universal. The particulars of each character are unique, yet the themes remain the same. Despite the occasional fragmentation of the story, the exploration of identity, music and time make for a melodic and intelligent novel.        --- Reviewed by Sarah Rachel Egelman

044654146X|5.0|I found this book to be well-written and very informative on the subject of not just `how' Israel has come to be a great startup nation, by `why'. The Israeli's have proven once again that \\"necessity is the mother of invention.\\"    In May of 2010, I was able a 10-day tour of Israel, and was struck by the vitality and energy of the young nation. Everyone we met seemed quite serious about their jobs and busy about them. Not only that, but the people seemed very proud of all they had been able to accomplish in such a short time and under such difficult circumstances.    Before reading the book, I had no idea that so many of our modern conveniences come from Israel, from optical devices to chipsets to agricultural/irrigation technology. Perhaps this is poor marketing on the part of the Israeli's, or maybe they're trying to let their products and innovations speak for themselves.    One of the more interesting examples of innovation was near the beginning of the book, with the \\"Better Place\\" car company. The idea of utilizing battery-swapping stations rather than battery-charging stations solves a number of problems that has hampered the electric-car industry.     I also noticed that Israel's entrepreneurial spirit has caused a steady shift away from the socialist roots of many of the settlers towards a more capitalist/free-market, mainly by necessity. The Israeli's have learned that startups and innovators flourish best under free markets, not burdensome regulations/mandates from the government.    The Israeli trait of chutzpah was refreshing to read about, and it made me wonder how much better the USA would be if more Americans questioned more and put their skills and education towards practical problem-solving more. America has many of the same problems that Israel has, but Israel seems more determined to fix them rather than push them off onto someone else to solve.    After reading the book, I have come to believe that it would greatly benefit the United States if we had a mandatory national service for 18-20 yr-olds and perhaps even a 'reserve' national service which gets everyone involved, perhaps for 2-3 weeks a year. Not only would this get more people involved in the task of governing the nation, it would push more private solutions into the public sector and force the government to be more efficient. Also, this policy would help reduce the size/power of the public unions and reduce the federal bureaucracy with many fewer permanent government employees.    Due to their difficult circumstances, the Israeli's have a purpose and will to survive and prosper despite the odds against them -- to do what most said cannot be done. However, will their growing affluence dampen it in the coming years? I hope not.

B000K7VHQE|3.0|\\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is about a perfectly dysfunctional family who for whatever reason decide to drive from New Mexico to California so that the young daughter Olive may participate in a competition where seven-year old girls must prove themselves perfect.  The father is trying to make it as a motivational speaker, and each time he speaks he sounds like an infomercial.  The grandfather is an aggressive cocaine addict who decides he cannot end his life until he offends everyone on the planet.  The son takes a vow of silence, and his silence, along with all those push-ups and chin-ups, makes him violent and angry all the time.  The uncle is the nation's foremost Proust scholar, and decides to emulate the great writer by screwing up his life and almost taking it.  Even the family van has temper tantrums and erratic behavior.      \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is supposed to be funny and quirky, but it's really disturbing and annoying.  We are captive in the family van as this irksome family goes on the road, and it's like we're being held hostage to their eccentricities.  \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is just too much \\"The Office\\" meets \\"Family Ties.\\"
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I was skeptical of this record when it first came out.  I am a Beatles fanatic and I have enjoyed the Apple Records releases and the various rare recordings.  But after time, I rarely listen to those as the original record recordings are so incredibly iconic.  Rubber S, Abbey Rd, St. Pepper, White Album... all of these are burned into my subconsciousness and fooling around with them is the same as fooling around with childhood memories.      However, with Love, what Martin and son have achieved is nothing short of beautiful.  They managed to turn these iconic songs into a kind of dream. It is as if I wandered into a sleep state and all of my subconscious memories have flooded into heightened sense of Beatles awesomeness.  It is every thing I've loved about the original Beatles record amp'd up a few notches.  The only song I don't care much for is Strawberry Fields as it is much like the other released novelty Beatles tunes and is inferior (though interesting and nice) to the recording that they released.      I love the juxtaposition of melodies throughout the record and I since Martin was the 5th Beatle, it robs none of the creative stream that originally gave us these works of art.  Of all the recordings on the album, I would say that Hey Jude and While My Guitar Gently Weeps are reasons enough to purchase this wonderful wonderful addition to the Beatles Legacy.      The new version of While My Guitar features George Harrison in a rare studio recording playing it Acoustic and George Martin, the symphonic and producing genius behind the likes of Sgt. Pepper and Eleanor Rigby and every thing else amazing for the Beatles,  has provided us with another heartbreakingly beautiful string arrangement as accompaniment.      If you are a true Beatles fan and you haven't heard this record, you are missing out.  I could go on and on about its merits, but I'll let you discover them for yourself.  It is awesome.
030726999X|2.0|Am I the only one that found the last two books of this series totally boring?  Hey, if you're into Swedish government/police espionage...then great because you'll get that ad naseum.  But the real attraction of the story is Salander's character and I felt that she didn't get enough coverage in Books 2 and 3.  For Pete's sake....she's laying in a hospital bed for most of Book 3. And the other characters don't have enough chemistry on their own to keep the plot moving along.  And as far as one reviewer comparing it to LOTR trilogy...you've got to be kidding!
B002ZG997C|3.0|This movie had some of the most entertaining action scenes in a post apocalyptic movie although short lived action scenes. However it lacks the epic scope of Mad Max    To get to the really good action scenes, you have to sit through boring and somewhat uninteresting characters. The first word isn't spoken into about 6 minutes into the movie. I really didn't find myself that interesting in Eli (Denzel Washington's). He is simply nothing more then a man (with a stonecold personality) who found a king james bible and wants to take it somewhere. Other then that their is nothing interesting about him. He has no past basically, The movie tries do damage control in the later half and we learn more about Eli, but it was a little to late for me. Gary Coleman is a little better in his role as a mad tyrant who believes in the old philosophy that he who holds religion, holds power. Which btw, the movie refers to the bible as \\"the book\\" for a good portion of the film but it's pretty obvious after awhile that it's a bible he is carrying. Anyone knowing at least some religious history could figure it out from the get go. So i have no idea why they keep calling it \\"the book\\"    It's ok film, i would say rent it

0545123283|5.0|Linger, the second installment of the Shiver trilogy, is an engrossing, go-away-I'm-reading type of book. I enjoyed Shiver. I enjoyed it enough to pre-order my copy of Linger and begin lurking around Maggie's blog. But Linger is even better than Shiver. Linger traded a bit of lovely prose for a bit of raw soul, and went deeper, painfully so. Don't worry, there's still lots of lovely prose, but Grace and Sam share the spotlight with Isabel and Cole in this book. Cole, a new character to the series, was the key to making this book totally sing. I became as invested in his journey from broken rock-star junkie, to human being--and he and Isabel's complex relationship--as I was in Grace and Sam's story. Maybe more, since Cole and Isabel's characters were presented with so many more layers and motivations and damage than the two stalwart lovers.<br /><br />I would recommend this series because it's sweet and dark and beautifully written, with a plot that has hooks all over the place. I would recommend this book because I really, REALLY didn't want that last page to come. I know I've read a good book when after I've finished it, I feel just a little bit different, like the author has exposed some soft, vulnerable spot that we all work so hard to keep protected.

193413712X|2.0|I really wanted to like this book. Read these reviews. Saw that it won a Pulitzer.  From the moment I started this book I never got into it.  I was going to put it down for good 50% into the book, but decided not to so I could say  \\"Yes I read it. Yes I finished it. Yes I did not like it.\\"  I guess Dave's \\"Harding tries too hard., March 5, 2010\\" review here best sums up how I feel about the book.<br /><br />I could not stand his writing style. Really, I found it difficult to read, confusing, and thought he was trying to write in a different style just to be different. If it was meant to sound like the main character's thoughts as he was dying, then it was a stupid method.<br /><br />When I was more than 50% through the book I could not wait to finish it and stop reading it. I just did not like this book and to anyone about to read it I would just take notice this book is clearly not for everyone.
B000001FO4|5.0|As the title of this review says, this is no \\"Hair Band\\". If ever a band was unfairly labeled, it was Cinderella. This is band of gifted, talented musicians, led by Tom Keifer, who is one of the most brilliant musicians alive. The album title should be your first clue that this is no ordinary \\"Hair Band\\", it paints a picture (Along with the almost majestic, masterfully understated cover) of what's to come. There's a very dark undercurrent to this album that's often missed, and it helps shape the album into the masterpiece it is. (All thier albums had a dark undercurrent, which often went unnoticed, even the debut 'Night Songs' which was thier most \\"Hair Band\\"-ish effort.)<br /><br />  It rips out of the gate with 'Bad seamstress blues/Falling apart at the seams', as good an album opener as there ever was, and never lets up. The groove is infectious and it sets the tone perfectly, There's not a bad song to be found, from the Driving rock of 'Gypsy Road',as good a straight up rock song as has even been recorded, to the beautiful elegance of 'Coming Home' to the outstanding closer 'Take me Back', a song not about relationships, but about wanting to go back to the innocence of youth. While Keifer's voice does take some getting used to, it always seems to fit, and his guitar playing is underappreciated. Jeff LaBar is a great compliment to Keifer's guitar work, Eric Brittingham is one of the most underrated bassists alive, and Drummer Fred Coury is rock solid. The chemistry between the 4 is obvious and it's that aspect that sets them apart (Strangely, for the second straight album Coury doesn't actually play on the recording. The late, great Cozy Powell did the studio drumming on LCW. RIP Cozy.)<br /><br />  Cinderella was, and still is, as I saw them live on July 5th 2010 and they were the best live band I've ever seen, a straight up blues influenced ROCK band, and this is a ROCK album with great songs, great musicianship, and, contrary to what this band's perception was, no cheese. And it's as good a rock album as has ever been recorded. This is thier best album, followed by the seldom heard 'Still Climbing', then the incredibly underappreciated 'Heartbreak Station', and 'Night Songs', but all all 5 star efforts. So if you're foolish enough to only have one album by this incredible band this is the one to get. It still sounds relevant even 22 years later, and it remains one of those rare albums that amazes you during every listen. This is a cliche, but this is a desert Island albun for me, that's how great it is, So please don't let the label scare you off, this is a great, great band of talented musicians with brilliant songs. I can't recommend 'Long Cold Winter' highly enough, and after you hear it, you won't be able to either., no cheese. And it's as good a rock album as has ever been recorded.

B0002EXH54|5.0|Peace Sells is a milestone album in 80's heavy metal.  \\"Wake Up Dead\\" and \\"Peace Sells\\" are iconic, and \\"Devil's Island\\" is another strong song.  With all that being said, I do have some problems with the lyrics in the next two songs although the music kicks ass: \\"The Conjuring\\" about black magic, and the disgusting \\"Black Friday\\".  \\"I Ain't Superstitious\\" is a cheesy cover song that would have been better as a B-side (like \\"These Boots\\").  However, this was Dave Mustaine's and Megadeth's solid effort to compete with his former band Metallica.  Metallica's early success was thanks to Mustaine's influence and the songs they had already written together.  Unfortunately, this album marks the end of their first line-up, but they would have a better one with \\"Rust in Peace\\" through \\"Cryptic Writings\\".  I still give the album five stars for its place in heavy metal history, the landmark \\"Wake Up Dead\\" video, its iconic songs, and awesome cover.
B0000C1733|5.0|I definitely concur that this cd has a good medley of Red Hot Chili Pepper's Hits. I also love that there are a wide range of songs for different emotions such as Under the Bridge when a someone wants to listen to something to calm their emotions and others such as \\"Give it Away\\" when you want an emotional energy boost. The following are a rundown of the songs and a brief info on each:<br /><br />  1. Under The Bridge 10 out of 10 - A song that is about feeling alone, but having the consolation of living in L.A. I also like how Anthony Kiedis sings a creative mini narrative at the end of the song's chorus when he mentions about what happened when under the bridge downtown.<br />  2. Give It Away 10 out of 10- A RHCP classic about being generous and giving with what you can in life with happiness and enthusiasm. He then energetically sings about what he has to give away. This is a high energy song to listen to when you need an emotional boost, and the song is good for working out to or running a couple miles to as well.<br /><br />  3. Californication 10 out of 10- A strong song about some of the symbolisms of California culture and what makes it a state worth dreaming about.<br /><br />  4. Scar Tissue 10 out of 10- A very dramatic song about sharing with the birds a lonely view, from what I take the references made are metaphoric.<br /><br />  5. Soul To Squeeze 10 out of 10- From what I take in this song, there are some very deep emotions that are being released and expressed, but that he is also going to take it easy along the way.<br /><br />  6. Otherside 10 out of 10- A very dramtic number about going through some psychological and other life challenges and the thoughts of what are being experienced.<br /><br />  7. Suck My Kiss 10 out of 10- A major makeout song with creatively put together sexual innuendos.  It is an upbeat song, but also one that a person would want to use discretion in playing around someone younger than 13 years of agel<br /><br />  8. By The Way 9 out of 10- A fast energy song involving metaphoric adventures of people that are to be met and places to go.<br /><br />  9. Parallel Universe 8 out of 10- This is a very creative number about an emotional journey that the singer is going through that is making way for a spiritual rebirth.<br /><br />10. Breaking The Girl 10 out of 10- A very good song about a special woman who has impacted the singer's life, but simultaneously had her heart broken.<br /><br />11. My Friends 10 out of 10- A great song about how he learned the meaning of happiness from a little girl who taught him to express his love unconditionally at an important time when people in his close circle were striving to feel better emotionally.<br /><br />12.

B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I chose this microphone to use with my Kodak Zi8 video camcorder.  So far, I have been pleased with the ease of use as well as the compatibility with my camera.  This is a good mic for interviews and still situations where the camera sits away from the subject.  The batteries are simple and inexpensive to replace.  It is built as well as most microphones of this type.  My Zi8 seems to work much better with the microphone than the built in microphone that comes with it.
B0034JV5YO|5.0|As a collector of quotes, I frequently come across one with which I don't agree, like \\"A gentleman is a fellow who can play the accordion but doesn't.\\" If that weren't bad enough, Ambrose Bierce defined the accordion as \\"An instrument in harmony with the sentiments of an assassin.\\" What's wrong with the accordion, I ask. Dating back to the early nineteenth century, this noble instrument has long supplied the melody for folk music from a variety of cultures. What's klazmer or a tarantella or a polka without an accordion?<br /><br />Accordionists have been the subject of jokes and wisecracks, yet they are handling an extremely complex instrument that is suited to a wide variety of music, from folk to rock to classical. Those who master it can produce rich sound that does not require accompaniment. And, really, is there anything more romantic than having a strolling accordionist stopping by a candlelit table and playing \\"That's Amore\\"?<br /><br />Those who disrespect the accordion turn their backs on an instrument that can score every mood from depression to elation. Deutsche Grammophon has recently released Richard Galliano - Bach, a collection of music that should put to rest any negative connotations associated with the accordion. Galliano, one of the foremost accordionists of our time, has practiced and performed Bach over the years, but this is the first time he has recorded the composer's works. Accompanied by a string quintet, Galliano's interpretations of familiar pieces such as Orchestral Suite no. 3 in D Major and Sonata for Flute and Harpsichord no. 2 in E flat major soar. Every piece performed is a gem unto itself.<br /><br />Playing the accordion since the age of four and recipient of the Acad&eacute;mie du Jazz's Django Reinhardt Prize (\\"French Musician of the Year,\\" 1993), Galliano presents his audience with faithful renderings of the music as Bach wrote it. As in any great orchestral production, the music elevates the listener who is not hearing an accordion, but the works of a master played by a master.er played by a master.
B000058USU|5.0|This historic reading of Beethoven's Missa Solemnis by Otto Klemperer (1885 - 1973)and the New Philharmonia Orchestra and Chorus dates from 1965. The soloists are Elisabeth Soderstrom, soprano, Marga Hoffgen, contralto, Waldmemar Kmentt, tenor, and Martti Talvela, bass. The recording was instantly accepted as a classic, and it remains so today.  In 2001, EMI issued this recording as part of its &quot;Great Recordings of the Century Series.&quot;  The 2001 issue is out of print and has been replaced by this virtually identical 2008 reissue.<br /><br />Beethoven composed the Missa Solemnis near the end of his life, and the work represents, as many critics have noted, Beethoven's attempt &quot;to come to terms with God&quot;. (Lewis Lockwood, &quot;Beethoven: the Music and the Life, p. 405) Although born a Catholic, Beethoven was not a regular churchgoer. As he became older, Beethoven became increasingly preoccupied with spiritual concerns. He was familiar with and drawn to the work of liberal theologians of his day who stressed the personal, inner, and seeking character of religious life over adherence to dogma and ritual. (Lockwood, p. 403)<br /><br />The highly personal character of Beethoven's religious search, as expressed in his Missa Solemnis, might make the work particularly appealing to listeners today who are skeptical of particular creeds and of organized religious institutions. Otto Klemperer was himself a lifelong seeker in terms of religion. Born a Jew, he converted to Roman Catholicism only to return again to Judaism late in his life. The difficulties of the Missa Solemnis -- in terms of the wide disparity of style and tone among its movements, its use of archaic modalities and musical forms, its contrasts of lyricism and fury, might be explained by remembering the personal character of the work and its place in Beethoven's own religious search.<br /><br />Klemperer's recording of the Missa Solemnis is epic in character and possessed of a craggy grandeur. He captures the religious, highly idiosyncratic character of Beethoven's score and wields the work into a unity. The chorus and the soloists sing with passionate intensity.<br /><br />The Missa Solemnis is in five movements. It begins with a solemn orchestral introduction to the opening solem Kyrie. The middle movements, the Gloria and the Credo, feature passionate and fiery opening sections and lengthy fugues for their conclusions. The fourth movement, a Sanctus, has lovely, florid passages for solo violin which accompany in turn the soloists and the chorus. The final movement, Agnus Dei, involves a musical contrast between a march and warlike theme in the orchestra and moments of transcendent peace at the conclusion. Beethoven marked this final movement as a &quot;Prayer for Inner and Outer Peace.&quot; (Bitte um innern und aussern Frieden.)<br /><br />Many listeners and critics have difficulty with the Missa Solemnis. It has been described as &quot;Beethoven's least approachable work.&quot; (William Drabkin, Beethoven's Missa Solemnis, p. 1) As I noted, the difficulties are largely due to the wide variety of musical styles that Beethoven utilized in this composition and to the difficulty of integrating these difficult, diverse styles into a coherent whole. Klemperer's reading on this disc brings out the character of each movement of this other-worldy music.<br /><br />In his biography of Beethoven mentioned above, Lewis Lockwood wrote (p.411) that the Missa Solemnis was Beethoven's &quot;largest contribution to the expression of the spiritual, in the various senses of the term, [and] is also a symbolic representation of humanity's search for peace that can only be discovered through religious feeling, collectively and personally.&quot; Klemperer's classic recording is one of a number of versions and interpretations that will help the listener approach this work. The Missa Solemnis is a music for many times and places. Each new version will carry something of Beethoven's message to the receptive listener.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanethoven's message to the receptive listener.<br /><br />Robin Friedman
B000RZIGVS|1.0|This review is not about the actual show \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\".  I love it or I would not have purchased this set.  My problem is the way it was manufactured.  There are no inserts, No Cover art.  The Trays containing the DVDs break very easily.  And usually are shipped broken.    If you can find this set as cheap as I got mine then it might be okay (I spent $75.00 for mine).  But unless you can get it that cheap, it is more advisable to buy each season individually.  This way you get a decent case and artwork to store your set.  Otherwise you will have to create your own cover art and purchase case to keep your collection safe.

The political truth of what the Perons did in the 1940's is there but not complete. Madonna and Banderas are good in this very challenging score. The movie can seem a little long during the second half.

B002ZG98Z0|5.0|Yes, this movie is for fans of the series (I've watched the entire six seasons about a dozen times). It's a wonderful homage to the series and to the unforgettable portrayal of the friendship between these four women.  It was so fun to see all the references to situations from the series woven into the story.  It was like a trip down memory lane yet it progressed the story of the friendship between Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte, and Samantha in a very funny way. After all, SATC has always been about friendship. I think Michael Patrick King is brilliant, and I'll never tire of the girls.  I want more.
030726999X|5.0|Incredible plot, characters not encountered anywhere else and a conclusion to an outstanding series that does not disappoint.
055358202X|2.0|In this installment of the series I feel that GRRM has either gotten lost or he has decided to take the series in a new direction.<br /><br />Part of my interest in the Song of Ice and Fire has been reading the divergent storylines and the tension of their inevitable clash.  Feast takes a step back and focuses (or should I say unfocuses) on the storylines themselves.  More and more, it seems that GRRM has abandoned his original vision of the series.  The cohesiveness of the story has wandered dangerously and I worry that A Song of Ice and Fire will degrade into \\"Wild Cards: Westeros edition.\\"<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with Wild Cards, its a series of stories written in collaboration by a writers under GRRM's direction.  Rather than being a single story, WC is a mish mash of short stories set in the same post apocalyptic setting.  Sometimes the characters converge, ofttimes they don't.  Their is no master story arc, no common resolution.<br /><br />The writing in Feast is still good, but the epic feel of the first three novels has given way.  Feast feels more like a collection of serial novellas.  The book has its shining moments, but those moments seem to get their spark from the stored energy of the prior novels.  Ultimately, Feast is a disappointment.  I've re-read the first three novels, but I haven't opened Feast since I first slogged through it.  I'll read a summary of Feast prior to reading Dance, but I'll never reread it.<br /><br />To my friends to whom I've recommended the series, I advise that they skip Feast altogether.  There are several online summaries that capture all the plot points (mostly minor sub-plots anyway).  Hopefully GRRM will regain his focus in Dance.  If he doesn't, I will declare A Song of Ice and Fire a great fantasy trilogy and ignore subsequent afterbirths.
0307454541|4.0|After spending the better part of the day yesterday finishing the second half of \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\\" I think I finally understand the huge hype surrounding this book. It certainly seems to have a little bit of everything in its pages--family drama, corporate intrigue, murder mystery, and a (very slight) bit of romance. It's been a long while since I've spent hours at a time reading a book because I just 'have to' know how it all ends. But interestingly enough, the story didn't \\"have me in its clutches\\" until about one-third of the way through. Up until that point, I was reading it, but kept wondering what all the fuss was about. Perhaps it was Larsson's intention to have the beginning of the book be mainly background and exposition, and to let the drama and suspense gradually crescendo until it blossomed into a thrilling murder mystery that (most) readers would not be able to put down. The plot twists throughout the latter two-thirds were definitely inventive and unexpected, and the main characters were strongly written, and were believable. I would recommend this book if you enjoy suspenseful thrillers, and are looking for one that is unique and will keep you reading it until the very end. However, a word of warning to possible future readers of this book: there are several extremely violent and misogynistic events that occur. I was not expecting them, and so I found them upsetting. I think the book's original title in Swedish, \\"Men Who Hate Women,\\" gives readers a better inkling of what awaits them in its pages. If you are a person who is at all unsettled by reading about sexual violence, I would not recommend this book to you.
B001QOGYBI|4.0|Roald Dahl has left a long legacy in children's literature. Many of his works have been turned into movies, including: Charlie And The Chocolate Factory/Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory, The Witches, plus James And The Giant Peach. Revered director Wes Anderson went an extra step further for making this film the first fully-animated adaptation of one of Dahl's books.<br /><br />Set in the British countryside(even though most of the cast has American accents!), Mr. Fox has to give up his life of stealing from farmers to start up a family with Mrs. Fox. A few fox years into it, their son Ash is going through his akward teenage phase while resenting having his cousin Kristofferson moving in on his territory at school. Mr. Fox decides though to move his family into a new place, while at the same time planning heists on the three local major farms with his new landlord possum, Kylie. After somewhat successfully strealing from them, the ex-Nazi owner of the cider ranch that Fox stole from plans to go WWII on his ass by attacking his new home. After he and the other two farmers run them out, the Fox family heads for the sewers along with the rest of most of the forest critters. The animals then dig under the farms and totally wipe out their stock. The farmers retaliate by flooding them out into the sewers, and eventually capture Kristofferson thinking that he's Ash. Fox then leads a rescue mission to get Kristofferson back with Ash and Kylie. The Fox family then make a new home underneath a supermarket which happens to be owned by all the farmers.<br /><br />This movie mixed stop-motion animation with computer effects pretty well, especially since it was done by Henry Selick, whose wizardry includes his own movie Coraline, and The Nightmare Before Christmas. Selick also worked on the animation for Anderson's The Life Aquatic. I was very suprised with the detail given to the animals' fur and expressions. There are times when the characters seem slightly out of place, like the 4ft. rat that worked for the farmers. Plus, they never explain why the regular forest animals wear clothes and can talk, while the other animals like bloodhounds and wolves are just regular animals. I was suprised though at how much good criticism this film got, especially from critics who aren't normally fans of animation. I thought it was in all a good movie overall, although not as funny as it could have been at times. Despite its charm, its not totally a movie for the entire family, but is truly one for the ages, and I have to say I'm impressed with its look at old fashion style for a modern day productionthat worked for the farmers.

B0026RHR6K|2.0|I should have paid closer attention to what others were reporting in the reviews.... The nice looking (If too big) packaging of the complete series is poorly designed.... It is difficult not to damage the DVDs and some of mine were actually damaged as in skipped, parts had to be jumped past so I missed things as arrived new..... After that happened I was glad about one thing: Amazon standing behind the product something not every DVD seller will do.... Do yourself a favor and buy each season separately.... Yes, it will be a little more money but you can avoid the aggravation of out of the box brand new damaged DVDs.... If you must buy this I suggest you open each season by removing the entire inside holder and placing the DVDs in temporary cases repeating this with each season because you can't help damage/scratch the DVDs taking them in/out of the packages.....The free toaster model was soooooo unnecessary......I give the poor packaging 2 stars. The series I give 4 1/2 stars and Amazon gets 5 stars for looking out for the customers............
B002T9H2L0|2.0|I can't help but ask if Quentin has contempt for his audience.  This over-long exercise in silliness would lead one to think so.<br /><br />Yes, the \\"Jew Hunter\\" is a great character and well done, but Brad Pitt is horrendous.  And what is with the comic book captions?  I heard about the failed \\"Tavern Scene\\" a long time ago, and would agree with most critics that was one of the movie's bottoms.<br /><br />This was the first Tarantino movie I have seen since Jackie Brown, and regret wasting my time on this joke of a film.  Pulp Fiction will always be one of my favorites, but is Tarantino turning into our generation's Orson Welles?<br /><br />I can forgive Tarantino for poor editing, but my wife will never forgive me for making her sit through this narcissistic exercise in gore and poor acting.<br /><br />My tip -- if you are curious, hang on to the remote and fast forward through the tediousness.  I think one can watch a accelerated version in about 45 minutes.
B002XMGGK6|2.0|What I hate more than a bad movie is one that had a great premise and wastes it.    This is a simple plot.  A man, Clyde Shelton, feels that he was denied justice over the death of his wife and daughter and wants to punish those that were responsible.  But what happens is the ADA, Nick Rice, who prosecuted the case with an eye more on his win lose ratio, becomes the hero and victim of the his ambition becomes the villian.  About 10 minutes is used to set up the story but there is no transition to show or justify anything.  All of a sudden the ADA is caring and the victim becomes a psychopath.    Beyond that there are key plot points that are simply wrong.      It is stated that Clyde bought a number of properties in the area under his own name but transferred title to a dummy Panamanian company.  Therefore, they cannot locate them because of protections by the Panamanian government.  The first part of this is wrong.  If he bought them under his name, they can find the properties as the names of all previous owners remain attached to the properties forever.  This is a simple computer search.  Additionally, if you have the name of the Panamainian shell company, it would be listed on numerous public records including property tax records!    Second, Nick gets a list of amounts paid by the dummy corp and then compare them to the sale prices of commercial properties.  By doing this he locates a property next to the prison that Clyde is being held.  This would be impossible.  It is obvious that the writer never purchased a piece of property!  The check you write at closing is not the purchase price of the property but a net amount, purchase price less deposit plus closing costs, etc.  It is never the exact purchase price.    Finally, Clyde is suppose to be a genius.  Therefore, if he planted a bomb, he would have put tamper guards which would have made it impossible for them to move the bomb even a few inches let alone many miles accross town.    These a the worst plot points.  There are just too many to list.    Add to this a mediocre performance by Jamie Foxx and a confused performance by Gerrard Butler and you have movie that is a waste of time.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Excellent knife, High value for the money. I'm not a rich man and thus want a knife to do the job w/o concern that I might damage an expensive purchase.  This knife is solid, came razor sharp and is comfortable in the hand.  Bit off balance and it is heavy, but it gets the job done; cutting,chopping, slicing, etc.  Nice sheath plastic insert makes it easy to re-insert; once you adjust all the straps to it, works great, drop it in and close without needing to take my eyes from my task. Did replaced the shoe string leg strap with a 1/4\\" wide shoelace made a BIG differance.  Yes I would like it to be lighter, but for a knife this size can't complain it gets the job done and I don't worry about it because I didn't pay a fortune for it.  Great knife and a perfect size, good sheath with multiple attachment options; leg, pack, vest, and bag.
1423101499|4.0|In Battle of the Labyrinth, Percy is starting to become a real man. As he gets ready to officially enter high school as a freshman, Percy is looking forward to spending another summer at his favorite Camp Half-Blood. Of course nothing is as simple as it seems. Being the son of Poseidon tends to carry its hazards in the mortal world and what happens at orientation? Well naturally Percy is confronted and attacked by demon/monster cheerleaders intent on killing him. However, Percy finds a familiar friend at his new high school in Rachel Dare - the mortal girl that can see through the mist like few humans and even demigods can. With Rachel's help, Percy manages to merely cause minimal damage to the high school and as a result only the auditorium is burned down this time.<br /><br />From there, we once again throw normal out the window and its the usual life of a half-blood for Percy and company. When Percy arrives at camp, he joins Annabeth in her newly anointed quest to go through the Labyrinth. The war between Percy/The Olympians and the Titan lord Kronos draws closer. Even Camp Half-Blood is no longer safe as the Titan Lord's army prepares to invade the once safe and impenetrable borders. The only hope that they have to stop the invasion is to go through the infamous Labyrinth of Daedalus - a vast and intimidating underground maze with surprises, traps, and monsters at every turn. The only problem is that Percy and his friends aren't the only ones looking to enter the Labyrinth and ask its 2000 year old creator some questions. Luke and company are back as well in their quest to resurrect Kronos and overthrow the gods of Olympus. What ensues is nothing short of an exciting race to the finish line to see who can learn the secrets of the Labyrinth while trying to contact Daedalus as both look to gain any advantage they can over the other side to complete their goals.<br /><br />Overall, I felt the book was pretty good for the 4th installment in the series. You've got Percy growing up with battles on many fronts in high school, girls, and realizing his potential as as well as exploring/further developing his powers as the son of Poseidon. Since Book 1, I've really enjoyed this series for what it is and not what I disliked about it after Book 1. My only small qualm with The Battle of the Labyrinth was that the battle against Kronos' army at the end was a little disappointing to read through. I think mainly because it didn't have Kronos in it and it seemed like it was too short even though there was plenty of action on both sides. Then again, I suppose that's the purpose of a 4th book out of 5 right? To set up the last one of course :). It ought to be plenty interesting in Book 5 and I look forward to seeing how it all shakes down in the finale!<br /><br />-Travis S.with battles on many fronts in high school, girls, and realizing his potential as as well as exploring/further developing his powers as the son of Poseidon.

B0037QGS0A|5.0|At first I was convinced that this movie was like many others: but not so.  I found Chloe interesting, carefully put together, and not at all what I expected.  Yes, there are elements in common with many other stories, however, altogether it was well told with lots of turns and twists which move the audience through various frames of mind.  At each phase, you're left thinking that Chloe is one thing, and then she changes in to something altogether different. The acting was great.
B00005BJ9W|5.0|1982 was a very interesting year for pop music development in that decade as well as it was for Duran Duran. Their self titled debut album was already out and that was just mildly tentative looking back. And one of the reasons that first album seems that way is because of this. Many times a bands second release is a huge step up for them but,as if their first album wasn't that strong (it was very good in many ways) this album was so potent it almost seemed like the work of another band entirely. One of the main differences here is that the bands rhythmic priorities had completely changed. Whereas the album tracks on the first album favored an ambient electronica flavor this album went right for heavy funk polyrhythms,percussion effects and some of the most harmonically complex synthesizer riffs courtesy of Nick Rhodes. This is not only their breakthrough album but was great for the band as a whole because on every song on this album you get to see how incredible these guys are as musicians. John Taylor is one of the funkiest bass players in the new romantic movement after Mark King and every single one of these songs are percolating with his emotionally charged and varied style of bass line: from high to fret-less tone,onto slapping and walking lines: they guy puts it all into the music and it clicks appropriately with whatever song it's accompanying. The first four songs on the album,including the mega hit title track and of course &#34;Hungry Like The Wolf&#34; are an example of the heavily Chic/ABC style funkiness this band appropriated for it's own uniquely flavored sound not to mention the potency of &#34;My Own Way&#34; and &#34;Lonely In Your Nightmare&#34; where John's basslines get free reign to leap up and down where they want. Personally these guys may have been young and full of it but lyrically (as well as musically) they certainly had a smart minded wit and imagination that would make Nile Rodgers proud. On &#34;Hold Back The Rain&#34; and &#34;Last Chance On The Stairway&#34; there is something of a poppy variation of the rock/funk sound,even if lighter on the jazz influence of Stanley Clarke's [[ASIN:B0012GMUPE School Days]] era that Level 42 dealt with too and Duran Duran put their complex pop style melodies with these songs. Every song here is brimming with melodic and harmony ideas you wouldn't believe and that's probably why it's so popular. It's an excellent example of intelligently thought out and funky 80's pop and yes: intelligence and funk usually HAVE to go together to make it all work out in that genre of music. The hit &#34;Save A Prayer&#34; is a pop song that does have a mildly more pronounced jazz influence with these unusually chorded synthesizers and harmonics as the same goes for &#34;New Religion&#34; and the pocket symphony of the closing &#34;The Chauffeur&#34;. Unfairly dismissed as being too easy an 80's pop throwback for years this album has continually reasserted it's strong musical values,as well as it's sense of flair and invention that goes into the very best of pop music of any sub genre in any era.ance On The Stairway&#34; there is something of a poppy variation of the rock/funk sound,even if lighter on the jazz influence of Stanley Clarke's [[ASIN:B0012GMUPE School Days]] era that Level 42 dealt with too and Duran Duran put their complex pop style melodies with these songs.

0596522347|5.0|I've been on a quest to find the best books to guide me in great design of the PowerPoint presenatations I prepare for our company. I've read some pretty terrible books, all telling me how to use the best clip art or guiding me in the mechanics of WordArt, etc.  Dreadful!  I finally came across Slideology and the Presentation Zen books by Garr Reynolds, and I enjoyed them all three immensely.  As far as having \\"advertisements\\" for other companies in the book (as one poster said), I found these to be more of real life examples, not advertisements.  I enjoy seeing how top companies market themselves in their presentations.  My plan is to revamp our corporate presentations using Duarte's design methods to show how much better our presentations can be.  If your intention is to learn to use all of the transitions and other tools in PowerPoint, this is not your book.  If you want to learn how to design a presentation that looks classy and will grab the attention of your audience, this IS your book.
0307592839|1.0|This author seems to be a critics' darling, but don't waste your money on this book. It is jumbled, it rambles, it leaves parts of the stories within stories unfinished while other ramblings go on forever, and you don't care. 75 of the pages are in power point format for no apparent reason and add nothing to this complete waste of time of a book! I hated how certain chapters began where a character's interactions were described, yet you did not know who this character was until later in the chapter.
1597801585|5.0|When trying to render the future, most authors tend to step a little too far from the present; not Bacigalupi. His completely convincing future is based closely on our present. In a post-oil era, the world has grown huge again. Swelling oceans drown coastal cities. Genetic engineering has created both wonders and horrors, often at the same time, like crops bred to survive super-plagues, and yet bred sterile, so that the seed must be bought anew every year. And in Krung Thep, what Westerners call Bangkok, a power struggle rages that may tear the city apart.<br /><br />The beauty of this work, apart from the wonderful prose, is the delicately-rendered psychology of the characters. In most dystopia stories, humanity has either banded together or else descended into savagery. But here, despite all the horrors, we pretty much continue on with the same pettiness and greed and lust--and, very occasionally, moments of grace.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B003L45JLW|5.0|This album is all about sound so issuing it in a new hi-def audio format was a great choice. I am not saying it does not have great songs; it does as any Tom Petty's album (I am a huge fan, by the way), but my impression was that quality of the songs on this album does not quite stands up to a gorgeous sound. Blu-ray audio delivers a full-range musical experience. I only have stereo set-up and I was blown away. I thought I would just listen to a small sample of an album which I have known by heart before I bought the blu-ray version - and I could not force myself to press the stop button until I listened to 5 songs. Now - I can not really see a difference between this format and SACD. I have Dark Side of the Moon on SACD and listening to Mojo on blu-ray or DSOM on SACD delivered same experience. The only advantage of a new format is that today probably more people have blu-ray than SACD-capable equipment - so it would be easier to distribute.   Bottom line: great Petty's music (probably the best since Wildflowers which I would also love to see on a hi-def carrier) in a mind-blowing hi-def. Still - can not say this is an ultimate version of Mojo - I would have to listen to a vinyl first:)

0060760273|5.0|I cant believe what an instant hit this book has been. Our two year old has a collection of 20 or so books, all of which he plays with but is never that interested in being read the stories. We needed a book to become part of a night time routine and this book became an instant favourite. We have to negotiate maximum number of times we read it  before starting!<br /><br />He loves finding the pictures mentioned in the poem, also joining in when he hears the word \\"hush\\" and I love how the  pictures get darker and darker until you see a room at night time, really sets the atmosphere for going to sleep.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|Keith Urban is an artist like no other. I have been a fan for over 5 years and I would have to say that this may be my favorite of all his cds. Each song has its own life and it would be a shame to skip even one on the entire album. Its practically impossible not to get up and dance to songs like Im In and Kiss a Girl. Til' Summer Comes Around is seriously chill inducing and Thank You, Keith's heartfelt song to wife Nicole, brings tears to my eyes everytime I hear it. I've found my future wedding song in the gorgeous, Only You Can Love Me This Way and can't help but song along to the upbeat Hit The Ground Runnin'.  Keith's work on this cd proves that he is an artist who is not afraid to wear his heart on his sleeve and that fact makes this cd a soul-bearing masterpiece. Its impossible to listen to this cd and not become a lifelong fan. I've had this cd in my stereo since I bought it last year and play it almost every day--I would recommend it to anyone in a heartbeat.
030726999X|5.0|If you read the first two books in this series, you already know you have to read this book.  It doesn't disappoint.  It carries the story further to a conclusion in a way that you must read from cover to cover without a break!  What a shame the author died before writing the next book.  Maybe someone will continue the story \\"in the style of\\" Stieg Larsson!
B003ELY7PG|4.0|Succinct and concise, it's a great book that's full of short clear ideas on how they feel a business should be run. I love how the written style of the book closely ties into their business ethos.
B001UV4XUQ|5.0|This movie nails three things.  That's all you need to know<br />(1) that first rush of love and passion.  The movie's fantasy dance sequence after Tom (Gordon-Levitt) falls for Summer (Deschanel) and that idiotic happiness is just the way it feels .. . I've never seen it done better.<br />(2) the anger and frustration when it's clear that there is an emotional disconnect between the characters; Tom again - perfect.<br />(3) The pain of withdrawal and slow recovery - make no mistake, this is love addiction where a character goes cold turkey.  It's tough to watch.<br /><br />I don't know if women relate to this movie in the same way, but this is a movie that is A Good Guy's perspective on finding and losing love without ever really knowing the woman whom he loves and why it doesn't work.  As such, Zooey's Summer is an appropriately opaque character.  Her feelings, motives intentions, etc., are all below the surface; there are just those amazingly melting eyes.  You could argue that her character could be more fully developed, but realistically, I think her character allows Tom to see all that Guys are able to see.  Summer and Tom make a good argument for women and men being different species that happen to be genetically capable of reproducing.  They are not Mars and Venus; they are more like Mercury and Pluto.  Even at their final accidental meeting, Tom is no closer to understanding Summer than he was when he first met her, and it's still not clear how she feels about anything.  Zooey's character has a secret heart that is just unknowable to Tom, to the viewer; maybe to Summer as well.<br /><br />The disjointed, non-linear structure of the movie make the pain easier to tolerate; just a little at a time.  It feels like the way you remember a relationship.  So five stars for a wonderful and unusual movie.  For guys, I think, it's also a True story.  That's worth everything.
0061122416|1.0|Don't bother with this one.  I challenge you to stay awake through the first few pages.  I though I was buying a great Brazilian novel like the Seamstress and was sorely disappointed.  Too many great books out there to waste your time on this drivel.

B002ZG997C|5.0|Totally enjoyed this movie, received the product from Amazon quickly and in excellent condition.  The Book of Eli held my attention from the beginning to the surprise ending.  I have watched this move 3 times already and have recommended it to others.  A group of us in my office have discussed this movie during lunch on several occasions.
B00008O31H|5.0|This CD is for anyone who likes blues and rock.  The songs are great and get you feeling good.
B000PKG7TI|5.0|The CD/DVD set was very well packaged.   I really enjoy the music, in fact these guys are responsible for getting me hooked on the genre.  As an American I find the collaboration with John Two-Hawks fascinating...I've never heard anything like it in fact.  What I would like to see for future releases is an insert translating his portions of the music.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|All the songs are awesome.  The lyrics and sound of this CD show a new step in the evolution of pop music.
B000063JZQ|4.0|Excellent cinematic production of a Shakespearean classic.  One of renegade director Roman Polanski's earlier works.  Shows why he's so valued for his directorship.  Faithful to the written work, creating imagery that even Shakespeare himself could not provide.  Highly recommended.
0143118420|2.0|I looked forward to reading this book and couldn't wait to get into the story. Very flat & uninspiring to say the least. It really didn't move me and the author missed the mark on this one. [[ASIN:1432743406 Smitty's Cave Adventures]]
B003L16FAE|5.0|So I'm one of those prudent shoppers who of course had to do hours of reading about the differences between the different Predator releases to make sure I bought the right one. Ended up with this one and am sure glad I did. As a fan of the original release, I was freaking thrilled to see everything portrayed in grainless HD picture. And the sound is absolutely fantastic  too! The purists are right in that DNR has been liberally applied, etc etc. But it didn't detract a single bit from how much I enjoyed this blu ray release. It really didn't, and I can't stress that enough. I had so much fun with the main picture and then dove right into the extra features, including the part about how the film was made. I smiled all the way through the feature as the actors and directors lightheartedly explained their roles in the making of the movie in their own words. Please, for the sake of humanity, do not cheat yourself out of the ability to enjoy this classic right now in its current form right now.  Go ahead and buy it to watch with your girlfriend, your man friends, your pets or whoever and enjoy as much as I did!
B002ZG997C|5.0|Pretty cool movie. I grew up with post apocalyptic movies and as a consumer of film since the 80s so I am quite anesthetized to movie violence and was certainly expecting it.<br /><br />***Mild Spoilers***<br /><br />Denzel is a man with a mission from on-high. I enjoyed the film, especially the bleak wastelands. There always has to be a highway scene where the hero walks past the all the dead cars and peers in at the skeletons and this movie didn't disappoint.<br /><br />Denzel's dialogue is spare, but he makes up for it with sheer presence. He's still looking pretty delicious too--more so--now that he is older.<br /><br />The fighting scenes were notable for not being over-the-top or over-long. Denzel's technique could best be described as: 'efficient'. Which is a plus for long-time movie fight watchers who are bitterly all too used to slowed frames, repeated impact glory shots and other martial art cheese that would not begin to transmit what a totally abrupt and brutal thing fighting can be--especially with weapons involved. But Eli is like a paladin on a quest who is clothed, shielded and armed in holy wrath. And so, he does not hesitate or play around when it comes to dispatching people but simply handles it--and keeps on walking.<br /><br />Portions of the ending were cleverly concealed and there is a moment of 'enlightenment', details of which I shall not go into. Recommended addition to any post apocalypse or Denzel movie collector.
B002TYZKIM|4.0|Michael Jackson's This Is It is an interesting look of the final months of the King of Pop's life. Michael Jackson's personal life wasn't always picture perfect but his iconic music forever lives on. I was really surprised how well Michael's singing and dancing ability was before his untimely death. He is very frail and appears drained at times but his voice and famous moves were still intact. I really enjoyed the rehearsal footage of They Don't Really Care About Us, Human Nature, Thriller, Black or White, and Billie Jean. Kenny Ortega did a great job on this documentary. Check this DVD out sometime!
B003KUSUG8|4.0|A lot has happened in hip hop the last 10 years since Eminem dropped his best album \\"The Marshall Mathews LP\\". We witnessed the snap music era, the call & dance era and now we are in the auto-tune era. Since then hip hop has become more about catchy hooks and ringtones than actual rhyme skills. Eminem dropped 3 albums since then and the last one \\"Relapse\\" was his first in 4 years. \\"Relapse\\" had its moments but it left fans wanting more. Some even wanted him to pick up the drugs again. Em heard all the criticism, so he decided to go back in the studio and rework what was supposed to be \\"Relapse 2\\". The result is his latest CD \\"Recovery\\".<br /><br />With the poor reception of \\"Relapse\\", Em has decided to ditch the  high pitched raps and use less sing-a-long hooks and go back to his roots. Em has spent the last year resharpening his skills and getting his old groove back. He practiced by outshining artists like Lil' Wayne on their own record. (Which he was known for doing. Check out  Jay-Z's \\"Renegade\\") And he had the best verse on the song with Kanye, Weezy & Drake. The first track \\"Cold Wind Blows\\" is a re-introduction to Slim Shady, with disses on Elton John and Mariah Carey. He tries to figure out his place in the current rap game on \\"Talkin' 2 Myself\\". \\"On Fire\\", is the classic Eminem flow I was waiting for on his last album. (Similar to his verse on Lil' Wayne's \\"Drop The World\\") There's not any rapper who can touch Eminem lyrically. \\"Seduction\\" is proof that Em has not lost his verbal punch.  The second half of the album is more personal. Reflection songs like \\"Not Afraid\\" &\\" 25 To Life\\", give insight to what Em has been through the last few years.  The drawbacks of this album are the lack of big name guest artist. Lil' Wayne has the only guest appearance and he tries hard to keep up. I actually like it when top rappers try to go jab-for-jab with Eminem. It brings out the best out of both rappers. (Royce Da 5'9 came closest years ago to holding his own against Em) Also, rock themed songs like \\"Cinderella Man\\" & \\"Wont Back Down\\" ft Pink are ok , but nothing special.<br /><br />This album is definetly different than \\"Relapse\\". When I reviewed \\"Relapse\\", I jumped the gun on my rating. That album has not been in my rotation since the first week I got it. However, \\"Recovery\\" has been jamming through my speakers since I got it. Matter of fact, \\"Relapse\\" should have been the name of this album because this is the return of the old Marshall Matthers. Em has proven that he is still a major player in the hip hop world. This generation might not understand how this man once dominated MTV. He was once the number one rapper in the game. And if lyrics mean anything they need to take a lesson. Nobody can deliver a verse like Eminem. This is the album true Em fans have been waiting for.rock themed songs like \\"Cinderella Man\\" & \\"Wont Back Down\\" ft Pink are ok , but nothing special.

B003JYOFIW|5.0|As a long-time fan (since their first release), I have seen Mark's and his brother's name on such TV shows as \\"Rugrats,\\" \\"All Grown Up,\\" and more (all on the Nickelodeon Channel). There's something remarkable about Mark's music that stands out; listen carefully to the theme for \\"Rugrats\\" and/or the music in the individual episodes.<br /><br />Anyway, I figured this new album would be good, so I didn't read any of the reviews beforehand. Actually, I didn't even know about it until the boys showed up recently on \\"The Colbert Report.\\" I blindly ordered the CD, and I must say, it is excellent. If you liked them in the old days, you'll love this CD. It's fast, fun and topical.<br /><br />Thanks for hanging around, boys! We'd love to hear more because we are still all devo!

B000AYEL6U|5.0|If you haven't already purchased this DVD and are still thinking about it, DO IT!  For years, I thought that Pride & Prejudice was the best period drama ever produced but that was until I watched North & South.  Words can't described how much I enjoyed watching this film.  It's well worth every penny you spend on it and it may just replace your copy of P&P on your shelf, or at least sit nicely next to it! :o)
0312323867|5.0|This book was awesome to me! My best friend let me borrow it and I am glad she did! This book has it all...love, friendship, life lessons, betrayl...I laughed, got angry and cried while reading this book.<br /><br />This book is the follow up book to Something Borrowed (which I only gave 3 stars to). I was so excited to read about Darcy (the girl who her best friend was sleeping with her fiance). I loved Darcy (much more than Rachel...I couldn't stand Rachel!) Darcy was a lot of fun to read about. She has so much spunk to her. I loved reading about her transormation into a better person as well as her being a snooty bitch!<br /><br />I will have to say that when I started reading this book I wanted revenge...I wanted revenge on Rachel for doing what she did. Toward the end however I was routing for Darcy to be the better person and patch things up with her friend. I still would have liked to see Rachel and Dex break things off and Rachel find someone else (usually relationships that come about through cheating fail anyway), but I was ok with them because Darcy found her happiness.<br /><br />Best chick-lit book I have read in a while!
B00009MGGI|5.0|This is a series I have watched several times and it never fails to incite my interest.  Francis Urquhart is the ultimate villain!  The acting is masterful and the political plot is suspenseful and modern.
0143118420|4.0|I wasn't sure if I would enjoy this book or not...I don't read much non-fiction and I don't think I have ever read a memoir. I really did enjoy reading this book. I enjoyed reading about Italy and Indonesia the best (India got boring at times to me). I think it is a wonderful story about a women's search for happiness and contentment. It really shows that a women can do ANYTHING she puts her mind to (with or without a man I might add) and that wherever you may be in life there is always a way to change it and always another life book to open.<br /><br />I think I am at a time in my life where I am turning a new page in my life book and I am trying to figure out what I want my new chapter to be about. I think I may have enjoyed this book more because I am at this time in my life. I would have hated this book if I would have read it at 21, but at 28 and marrried with no children yet...it was perfect!

1416550550|4.0|This fictional historical novel begins in 1913 with a 4-year-old girl hiding on a ship bound for Australia - alone. The story weaves back and forth through 100 years of the Mountratch dynasty, from England to Australia and back again, as it unravels a mystery of a kidnapping.      I like Morton's light descriptive writing which is easy to visualize. She portrays the key characters so that you understand them personally and join in their search for answers. However, just as I thought I had cleverly solved the mystery, new information would develop tossing my theory into doubt.      Each supporting character holds his/her own interesting dark secrets, regrets and insecurities which in turn affect the three central women in this tale of relationships, burdened with deception.     This book is over 500 pages, and although I believe the story could have been told in fewer pages, it did hold my interest to the very last page - I loved the ending. I need to mention that many insignificant characters are introduced throughout the story and may turn up again in other chapters, perhaps decades later, so it can become confusing at times trying to remember who is who, and oh, didn't I meet this person before? Still, it is an enjoyable read, especially if you like mystery, fairy tales, secret gardens, villains and heroes, romance and old English manors.
0316044938|4.0|This book is very moving. We watch what happens through Susie's eyes as she is lured by one of her neighbors into a hole in a cornfield, raped and murdered. Her family and friends are torn apart by her disappearance. While they can never find the body that police come to a conclusion that she is murdered. Susie lives through watching her family and following her murderer. She seems to appear to them without meaning to which gives us that feeling that maybe the dead really can see us. Her brother seems to see her more than anyone else and is a sweet child who just lives his life in the now. This book I believe would be great for anyone coping with a recent death because it gives us hope that they are okay and have their own great Heaven.
0307266303|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was entertaining and informative...it makes you believe the impossible is plausible; given opportunity, education and a whole lot of grit and determination. I found all the of discussion on barefoot running in this book very interesting too. I would recommend it to anyone interested in running, or achieving things that others believe them incapable of!!

B00319ECC4|4.0|Mechanize is the next step forward for Fear Factory.  I've heard some people describe this album as somewhere between Demanufacture and Obsolete, but I would have to disagree.  It really sounds like the continuing evolution of Fear Factory's unique sound, following Archetype and Transgression.  You may or may not know, but following the less-than-stellar album Digimortal, Fear Factory disbanded only to regroup later minus lead guitarist Dino Cazares (whom lead singer Burton had some trouble with), bumping bassist Christian to guitars and adding Byron Stroud (of Strapping Young Lad) to bass duty.  The new line up sounded good, but a little different as Christian plays different than Dino.  I really enjoyed Demanufacture (the first FF album I bought) and Obsolete.  Digimortal was alright, but didn't wow me like the other two.  With the new line up, their next album Archetype was a big improvement over Digimortal, and was a big leap in the right direction.  Transgression was a dissapointment for me, althought it had a few good songs.  Then nothing happened for a while.  Well, it turns out after Transgression, singer Burton reconciled with old FF guitarist Cazares and formed a new FF minus drummer Raymond and guitarist Christian (allegedly behind their backs?), adding drummer Gene Hoglan (also of Strapping Young Lad).    Because I came in on FF with the line up of Burton, Dino, Christian, and Raymond, that is to me the real FF.  The second line up felt like it was missing Dino, and the newest line up feels like it's missing Raymond and Christian.  So why am I rambling on like this?  Well, if (like me) you've been a FF fan for a while, you've noticed their sound changing and evolving along with their line up.  As a metal album, Mechanize is amazing.  As a FF album, it's very, very good, but somehow feels like it's missing something, and I believe that something is Christian and Raymond.    Burton's vocals on Mechanize are great, and not over-produced like Digimortal andTransgression.  Burton is THE voice of FF, and without him it wouldn't be FF.  Dino's guitars are some of the best he's done for FF, and the riffs are tight and catchy.  The tunes will get into your head and you will headbang.  Byron's bass is good, and since this is his third FF album, he definately knows what he's doing.  I have noticed there isn't as much emphasis on bass as earlier albums like Obsolete (which would occasionally single out the bass to great effect), and I kind of miss that.  Gene's drumming is insane.  His style is different than Raymond's, and it changes the sound that FF has had since 1989.  Gene does a great job of fitting his style into the FF sound that has become so loved, and a kudos to him for making it work.  Also, it might be my imagination, but I think Gene might play faster and tighter than Raymond, which is saying something because Raymond is a fantastic drummer.    As a stand alone album, Mechanize is filled with nothing but solid songs.  There isn't a bad one among the bunch.  This could also be their most driving album, with a constant emphasis on speed and crushing riffs coupled with brutal vocals.    As a FF album, it takes the FF sound a step in a new direction while also learning from the mistakes of the past.  Because of the line up change, they sound different, but also fresh, and that's a good thing.  The only thing holding it back from being on the top teir like Demanufacture and Obsolete is the variety.  All of the songs on Mechanize stay in the safe zone.  Their isn't as much experimentation and variety as their best albums, and as such the songs aren't as memorable and unique.    Should you buy this album?  Hell, yeah!  It's a solid album that no FF fan should be without.  Is it the new Demanfacture?  No.  But it doesn't need to be.  And at least it won't leave you with that sour taste in your mouth that Transgression did.

B002QP145C|3.0|I must say I hoped for more when I shelled out around $30 ( with shipping ) for the cool, full length Korean edition of the film.  The DVD quality is excellent, but the story only mediocre.    We certainly get a sense of the kind of warfare and weapons involved, as well as the odds against the Finns.  The film is too long, probably due to the fact that, if I understand correctly, it originally aired as a television mini-series over multiple nights.  Perhaps the seemingly endless progression of battles is presented in the name of realism, but this IS a movie, after all, and we get the idea after the 7th or 8th ( or 11th or 12th? ) Russian charge.      The acting is tepid all 'round. No one really stands out as memorable.      Great equipment and lovely footage of the Finnish landscape.  Never could figure, though, why the Russians kept wasting artillery throughout the film chasing the featured character around the countryside.  Whenever a particular Finnish soldier was going toward or away from the front lines, the Russian artillery would magically always hit right around this one lone, poor soul.  Smart shells in 1939?  And Soviet aircraft dropping entire bomb loads trying to hit a soldier on a sleigh?  Not very believable.      Still, the battle scenes seemed well done and the unimaginative and very costly Soviet head-on assaults are true to history.  The vast disparity in men and materiel available to the two sides and the grinding exhaustion to which the Finns were subjected are important factors handled well.    All-in-all, a good movie but certainly not amongst the best of the genre. Most probably the best for the Winter War.
0439023491|4.0|Another great book but only 4 stars b/c the mean ending:) I don't know how Ms Collins does it but I read through the night. Maybe it is the way Katniss is clueless at times and there are times random clues are dropped that there is something else going on. Love it and can't wait for the last one.Thank goodness she doesn't make us wait years for the next one.
B003L1ZXCU|3.0|The good things:  I thought the writing was very good and found the ideas intriguing and creative.    Nonetheless, I only got through about 1/4th of the novel.  By that time I felt I needed a bath.  A bit too clever, too much action, too much cheap sex and innuendo, too much violence, etc.  Tom Clancy on steroids.    I guess novels like \\"Daemon\\" are for 30-something fast-trackers who grew up with sound-bites and MTV.

And what's worse- i cannot for the life of me find a summary of this book, and since i couldn't retain any of this book, i'm going to fail the reading comprehension test when i go back to school.

Do you know when you get certain series on DVD and the commentaries are boring, the featurettes are just commercials and the gag reel is anything but funny?  Well Season 1 White Collar on DVD is the opposite.      1. There are five episodes with commentaries, selected very well, and the commentaries are with the main characters AND they are funny and insightful.  (We were waiting for somebody to make fun of the awkward Ford Taurus promotions in the show, and they do)  The actors clearly get along well with each other, and a funny completely unscripted.  Jeff Eastin is on the commentary for all five, so he shares a lot of insight too.    2. The gag reel, very funny and it just makes you like the show and the actors more.    3. The featurettes are very good, they cover the fashion of the show, which is almost another character.  They also cover FBI consultant they use.    4. Deleted scenes?  Want to have more background into Mozzie?  it is there.    So if you like the show, then the DVD's should be a must have.  I just wish more shows did as good of a job with the extras on the DVD's.
B002RI9ZPY|4.0|A Department so Secret it gets lost in its own organisation! Only when it turns to crime is there the doubt of it's authenticity. This Police thriller with many<br />characters is very entertaining.It is based in Sweden, therefore all placenames and characters are Swedish.This drawback set aside, a very entertaining book.
1439153663|4.0|The Kitchen House is an absorbing story of slavery and life on a big plantation. The story is narrated in alternating chapters by two distinct characters; Belle, a black slave and Lavinia a white indentured servant, whose perspectives on situations are as different as they are. Although they share the same chores, living conditions and indebtedness to their master, they are worlds apart where emotions or life choices are concerned. Grissom does an excellent job of giving the book an authentic feel for this time period and positively excels at making her characters, the circumstances they encounter and the story line real and believable. Further to the author's credit, she presents balanced views of the slaves and plantation owners actions without passing moral judgment. A few things bothered me however. The book starts strong and grabs you, then a hundred pages or so in, loses momentum, but fortunately picks up again. I also prefer strong female characters that fight to the bitter end rather than fade and weaken like Lavinia. Overall a very enjoyable read that would have appeal to anyone who likes a well written book with an interesting story line about love and the impenetrable bonds of the people we choose to be family. Good book club selection.
B000FFJYCU|4.0|First, service from the vendor was great.  Secondly, the movie is just as I recalled it when I first saw it in the theater - excellent!  Speical effects were \\"real\\" compared to what we see computer graphically these days, but it was the first movie to really get the viewer \\"into the picture\\" by using camera placement!  An excellent movie.  Fits in well with the other two really good racing movies involving Steve McQueen and Paul Newman.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I read a lot of other reviews that claimed that this title looks no different than the DVD.  I will say this; as far as reference quality material goes, this isn't one of them.  This isn't Avatar; it's not meant to look like crisp, clean, pristine CGI animation.  If you want to show off the merits of Blu Ray, then this probably won't wow anyone who is unfamiliar with the format.<br /><br />With that being said, BoB is still one of the best looking Blu Ray releases out there.  What makes it great is it's sharpness and clarity in spite of the grain heavy look of the series, which is intentional.  I'm glad the producers did not go back and go crazy with DNR.  Despite the grain in certain scenes, the clarity is astounding.  Uniform patches and stiching pop with sharpness.  Many of the outdoor scenes are like you are standing there yourself.  The foliage, mud, stones, brick, buildings, etc. are absolutely stunning to watch on a large TV.<br /><br />My only complain is that there are certain scenes in the Bastonge episodes that looked a little, murky.  Edges were muddy on some faces, and the blinding white snow did not pop off the screen like I was expecting.  I was looking forward to these scenes in 1080p more than anything else in the series, but they weren't as stunning as some others.<br /><br />All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who is a fan of war movies.  Just don't expect it to be reference quality material in terms of sharpness and clarity, but know that this is as awesome as Band of Brothers will ever look.
B003ICWTR4|5.0|As a long-time fan of The Boss, I have collected nearly everything!  This HD-DVD is extraordinary!  No one can rock a stage like Bruce, and this DVD is like being there, on-stage, backstage, in the front row!  It's obvious he and the band LOVE what they are doing, and from a purely selfish point of view, I hope they keep right on doing it.  I have seen them live several times over the years (starting in the late 60s before anyone had even heard of him, playing Cafe Wha? with a band called The Castiles!!) and can tell you this performance definitely lives up to the hype!!  Buy it, enjoy it, savor it again and again!
B00361DR4Q|5.0|Wonderfully surprised! This Blu-ray exceeded all of my expectations. When I played it on my Panasonic player, and used my Panasonic home theater setup, both me and my three guests were impressed. The recording was made of a live stage performance in Italy, and the orchestral sounds were stunning; we heard every instrument, it seemed. The quality of the video itself was far superior to the usual Blu-Ray video -- which I have come to expect to be top quality -- as well. The only way to improve on the enjoyment of this performance would to have been sitting in the best seat, in the theater, the night of the recording. I have never cared much for opera before, but, based on this, I may have changed my mind.

B000QRIGLC|5.0|I was recommended this book from a friend and I so happy I took his advice.  Putting all the political \\"stuff\\" aside that others have commented on, I was truly inspired by the incredible story.    The men and women that fight for our country are true heros and this story tells why.  The story of the training to become a Navy SEAL and then this incredible mission was both a thrill ride and great story.    I could not put this book down and recommend everyone read this story.  Kudos.

1596680296|5.0|I have only been knitting for 6 months.  I am confident at knit stitch, purl stitch, slip slip knit, knit 2 together, knit front back and a couple other common stitches.  I have done one mitten project with 'short rows'. I was a little intimidated by the concept of knitting socks.  I decided to jump in and give it a try.  What is the worst that could happen - I would just end up 'frogging' (ripping it out) and start over again.  I just knit my first sock and it even fits!!<br /><br />The book has Great pictures.  Great hints.  Everything is explained very well so that I wasn't immersed in knitting lingo that I couldn't understand!  I am very happy that I got this book!<br /><br />YES!  You can teach yourself to knit socks!  I can't wait to get started on my second pair!<br /><br />UPDATE:  MAY 2012<br />This book taught me how to knit my first pair of socks - and now less two years later, I have made over 40 pairs and still counting!  The magic loop method, while novel, is unwieldy to work with - I found I was constantly untangling yarn since there are always two sources of yarn to contend with.  I LOVE working on dpns - and I never have 'second sock syndrome' because I always have two sets of dpns. I will cast on one pair - work the cuff or the entire leg, and go to the second sock and cast on the second pair.  I will work the cuff and leg on the second pair, and then go back to the first pair for the heel flap.<br /><br />This book is ALWAYS in my knitting bag - as a reference when I use different weights of yarn as to the number of stitches to cast on, working the heel flap (which I haven't memorized) and different stitch patterns for the leg.  Awesome book!!!  Of all the abundant & numerous books in my knitting library, this is the one I always reach for!

B002VPE1B6|5.0|This movie EPITOMIZES exactly what a Blu-ray player was created for!! You have a sweeping epic storyline with extremely good actors, and Incredible Sound. But, the very best element to this dvd is the Picture. If you have your HDTV calibrated, the picture is so incredibly perfect that it's scary. The detail that went into the making of this blu-ray disc in nothing short of SUPERB!!!!! One will be very hard pressed to find a dvd with such true clarity to the picture. This disc is truly one of the best I've seen/viewed when it comes to superb picture quality!!!!! I very, very Highly recommend this disc to all movie lovers. There is just no way you can go wrong.

B001AQO3WY|4.0|This series was a little outrageous, but funny. I don't really buy that rangers acted like this, but good drama. I did like the lingo of the military speak, they probably went a little overboard with the curse words. My favorite part is the end of each episode. I remember hearing that they got actual rangers for that part.

B0015R9K2G|5.0|&#34;A Little History of the World&#34; is a wonderful book. The whole book is presented as a &#34;story&#34;, all the historical events are mostly linked together and in a sequence. Also, this book introduces a wide range of historical events and stories, from Jesus Christ to Mecca, and from Constantinople to the Qin Dynasty in China.        But because this book was written in 1936, the WWII was not described, which some (including me) might find it disappointing.        In a nutshell, &#34;A Little History of the World&#34; is an interesting read. The words used are very easy to understand, so I recommend this book to most age groups, especially children and teens. Futhermore, I think this book is a must-read to all those people who are interested in world history. Although the book does not include the epic WWII, but you can still find some very inspiring and exciting stories, from the ancient times to the First World War.    Hope you all like this book. Enjoy!
B000VMFDW2|5.0|I watched the HBO Series, The Pacific and was interested in reading the underlying biographic texts of the characters.  This one was simply fascinating.  It is certainly true that Sledge gives what some might call a dispassionate account of the war, but the narrative is fascinating.  I have recommended this book to several people, especially for those who want to truly understand what the Marines experienced in that time period. The rules of engagement may have changed since then, but the emotions this man experienced are probably universal. There are some horrific descriptions of man's inhumanity to man, but he presents the information because it truly is necessary for an honest account. A most read for every American History buff.
B003OCWF6I|5.0|Hollywood is sometimes down right weird!  This year two movies with the same plot and same characters came out with in months of each other,The Losers and The A Team.  The Losers is based on a comic book and the A Team well you know....  When the A Team video comes out I will review it, but of the two, The Losers was the best.  It is grittier and rougher arond the edges and true to its source the comic book. Edgy is the key word here.  The Losers are a no nonsense group of men and woman.  The whole picture is feels harsh , grimy, rough, and delibrately anti slick .     The characters are stero typical in many ways,BUT since they are not well known actors/faces they come across fresh and dare I say it \\"likeable.\\"  I am very inpressed with Morgan[Clay] the leader. His character has flaws and he is not always right.  The \\"girl\\" is truly a badass and that is why during one \\"funny\\" scene the losers try to kill her.  Oh the \\"sex\\" scene is really HOT, pun intended.    The action is enhanced by the use of different camera angles.  The main thing I want to praise and bring attention to is the use of humor.  Humor in films particularly action movies must never be forced or corny.  It must flow out of the action and usually it is dead pan.  The Losers does this right and it makes the funny lines sound natural and funnier.    If there was death match between the A Team and the Losers, it would be no contest..The Losers, they fight to win and they don't fight fair or try to trick you.    The credits were welcome and a nice touch.  I hope there will be another film, but since this one didn't really make money, I doubt it.  That is ashame because I would love to see this group again.
0307389839|4.0|\\"As long as my body allows, I'll keep on running,\\" claims the writer of the oddest books I've ever read (especially Kafka on the Shore). Words that everyday average runners (like me) live by. Suffice it to say, though, that learning (while looking through the Explore collection at our local library) this ultra famous, Japanese author (who readers might think would take up equally odd pastimes) is also a long-distance runner, triathlete and ultrathoner was a complete surprise. Thus, as soon as I saw it, I moved Murakami's memoir about writing and running (especially his training for the 2005 New York City Marathon) to the top of my reading list. What I learned (while feeling guilty for not putting in more miles myself lately) is that in spite of his over-the-toppishly strange stories, he seems like a pretty normal guy, especially when it comes to running. In it, he tells how he came to be a runner (25 plus years ago), recalling the specifics of choosing this sport as a means of staying in shape after he sold his business to take on writing full-time. Later in the book, he states his personal reason for running, simply, (p 44) \\"It suits me.\\" It turns out that Murakami not only trains for and participates in a marathon per year; he also participates in triathlons regularly and has even run an ultrathon. Budding writers will appreciate his opinion on what it takes to be a good novelist, traits that include (p 76), talent, focus, and endurance. As a runner, I loved reading his thoughts about organized races (he's not competitive against other runners, I confess I am) and his frustration (which I share) with his inability to improve his race times as he's gotten older. He even goes so far as to say what he wants on his epitaph (p 174), which includes something about running! Best of the book is the sort of philosophical thoughts and words of wisdom, like (p 19) \\"...the fact that I'm me and no one else is one of my greatest assets,\\" (p 113) \\"I run; therefore, I am,\\" (p 115) \\"An end point is simply set up as a temporary marker, or perhaps as an indirect metaphor for the fleeting nature of existence,\\" (p 121) \\"...one of the privileges given to those who've avoided dying young is the blessed right to grow old,\\" and (p 153) \\"...since your faults and deficiencies are well nigh infinite, you`d best figure out your good points and learn to get by with what you have.\\"<br /><br />Lastly, my favorite of his sentiments (as I feel the same) is, (p 172) \\"Long-distance running (more or less, for better or worse) has molded me into the person I am today, and I'm hoping it will remain a part of my life for as long as possible.\\" Hear, hear! Fans of Murakami, especially those who are also runners, are sure to like (or even love) this memoir about a humble, average seeming long-distance runner, who happens to be a writer of extraordinarily strange fiction. Also good: The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, by Haruki Murakami, The Girl I Left Behind by Shusaku Endo and The Old Capital by Yasunari Kawabata.) \\"An end point is simply set up as a temporary marker, or perhaps as an indirect metaphor for the fleeting nature of existence,\\" (p 121) \\"...one of the privileges given to those who've avoided dying young is the blessed right to grow old,\\" and (p 153) \\"...since your faults and deficiencies are well nigh infinite, you`d best figure out your good points and learn to get by with what you have.\\"    Lastly, my favorite of his sentiments (as I feel the same) is, (p 172) \\"Long-distance running (more or less, for better or worse) has molded me into the person I am today, and I'm hoping it will remain a part of my life for as long as possible.\\" Hear, hear!

B000JK8OYU|5.0|I was unaware of this record's Cirque du Soleil roots (I'm not a big fan of Cirque du Soleil), but wasn't disappointed at all with this mix of amazing Beatles songs.  George Martin and son did an incredible remastering/mixing job, and I love that even the remaining Beatles were happy with the project's results.  I was expecting a simple collection of Beatles classics, but there is a beautifully executed blending and flow between the songs.  It was a pleasant surprise.  I would recommend this record simply on the amazing remastering job (it sounds beautiful!), but there's no need just to rely on that.  It's an interesting mix that I think any Beatles fan would enjoy.
1416955070|3.0|I'm probably one of the few who still hadn't read City of Bones. After reading so many amazing reviews on it I finally cave in and decided to read it. I'm still not really sure  how I feel about it though. I liked it, I just didn't fall in love with the story like many others seemed to.    There was a lot of everything in this book. With the writing there was a ton of similes. I think similes are great, but they were just so overused and some of them were pretty ridiculous. There were also too many paranormal creatures that were \\"thrown\\" in there too fast. I had to pay close attention or else something would go right over my head and I'd completely miss it. I kind of had to do a lot of re-reading of some pages because of that. There was so much that went on in this book. I'm sort of amazed the author managed to fit everything in less than 500 pages, but I'm sure that's also why I felt the pace of the book went really fast. Honestly, I wasn't hooked until the last couple 100 pages of the book.    I didn't really think much of Clary, the main character. She was like a lot of girls in YA books, smart, brave, yet makes some not so smart decisions. Jace was the reason I wanted to read this book because I've heard so many great things about him. Unfortunately, he's not a character I find swoon worthy, but I did enjoy his sarcasm and arrogance. I actually liked Simon the best, he was sweet and of course I always love the nice guy, best friend.    While City of Bones didn't end up being a favorite for me, it was still an entertaining book. I might get around to reading the rest of the series, but I doubt it will be any time soon.
1596912863|3.0|While I enjoyed the ending, I found most of the book to be unbelievable and incohesive. The main character spends most of her time in Austenland--and therefore much of the text--vacillating emotionally in ways that are not meaningful to the plot. There is very little text or emotion dedicated to the character with whom she eventually ends up.    There are several elements of the plot that are simply not believable, all of them related to Austenland and its rules and the tendencies of the other characters while in the book.    I found the end of the book to be very enjoyable (though somewhat lacking in the depth department), but I found the experience \\"odious\\" to force the middle of the book through my brain to get to it. From the time the Aunt dies (early on--not a huge spoiler) to the scene at the airport, I found myself enjoying little but the occasional (and short-lived) epiphanies Jane experienced.

Elizabeth doesn't wait for anyone to solve her problems, she goes out and does it herself.

Its not too long, so it keeps her attention.  While she doesn't understand it yet, I hope some day she will appreciate that like Elizabeth, she can use her own brain to get out of trouble, and in the end she doesn't have to marry the prince!

0316069906|5.0|Full disclosure: I was already vegan when I read this book. That being said, it was my first time really exploring why  I made the decision that I did, and it is precisely the balanced, fact-based, well-written approach of Foer's that I appreciated most, as often with such controversial subjects, any lack of balance can (for me) completely discredit a researcher with whom I might otherwise agree. Most impressively, Foer continuously challenges us with questions that get to the heart of the matter, leaving it to the reader to make their own decisions, but also explains how he answers those questions for himself, in order to even more fully weigh the facts he has presented from each angle (and by each angle, I mean every angle there is to take - while I mentioned I have not previously looked much into this topic, it seems clear that JSF performs some seriously exhaustive research). Whatever kind of -vore you may be, I challenge everyone to read this book so that we are at least all making informed decisions about the industries we support through the act of eating, the only consumeristic act we perform multiple times a day, every day of our lives with such extensive ramifications about how we do it. Whatever decision you reach upon finishing, JSF, myself, and anyone should support.

B002DKGWSE|4.0|It seems that most of the discrepancy here is between those who saw the original and loved it, those who never saw the original, and those who saw the original and hated it. But if we look at this movie as its own entity without comparing it to the original or any other similar films, we are bound to see what these directors/writers were going for which hits on themes introduced by horror film makers of generations ago. This film gives us a safe look at what it's like to a victim by sparing us nothing in the ways of brutality, human apathy and extreme realistic violence that literally \\"hits home\\" in this depiction. Horror film makers have always liked to test the boundaries of safety and comfort zones to show us that we can all become victims at any time through no fault of our own and this film builds on the viewer's fears that what we are watching could actually happen to us. Isn't that, after all, what good horror films do? They make us uneasy while we face our own mortality and wonder what we would do if we were in the character's situation. I don't think anyone could watch this movie without putting themselves in the place of the teenage girls, the overpowered son of the brutal gang leader, and the parents, all at different times during the course of the film.  When confronted with what has happened to their child, the parents do not go on a vengeance trip but are in fear of their own and their daughter's life when it becomes apparent that her attackers are in their own home. To say this is a revenge flick is untrue and misses the greater point being made. They will do anything it takes, no matter how gruesome or violent, to protect their beloved child. The film could have ended this way with the parents safely escaping with their daughter, leaving the battered bodies of the killers behind them. But the final scene allows viewers to go away from the film pondering the fine line between justice and vengeance and makes us wonder if we ourselves would be able to tell the difference when someone we love has been victimized. I don't believe the microwave scene was a last ditch effort by the writers for a thrill kill. But instead it turns the tables and makes the killer now a victim and the father now a murderer as those lines between vengeance and justice are blurred.     To follow along the lines of most of the other reviewers and compare it with the original which, I suppose, is inevitable, I think the original failed to make this final point and instead went for the sensational gore of the vengeance genre while missing whole-cloth what this movie hammered home hard and successfully. This film recognizes the original intent of the horror genre and gives lovers of these films hope that good horror films can actually still be made.
0143115723|5.0|Carlin, who was stationed as a reporter in South Africa from 1989-1995, chronicles the steps that Nelson Mandela took in unifying South Africa through rugby. The book was the basis for the movie Invictus. Simply, the book is a fascinating read. Carlin reports on all of the key behind-the-scenes events, talks to all of the major players (both athletically and politically) and weaves together the story of how South Africa avoided major civil war, using sport as a way of bringing people together, in the ending of apartheid. I learned a great deal from this book, starting with the importance of rugby in South Africa, and how Mandela made all the right moves in bringing both blacks and whites on his side. I thought the movie Invictus focused too much on the actual rugby; the book has all the sociological details a historian would want. I would recommend this book to anyone who believes that sports unifies people more than any other part of society, or to anyone who wants the details of how South Africa changed its political ways so quickly. It's easily one of the top 10 books I've ever read, maybe top 5.

0061729078|4.0|In the oft cited counter-culture staple, \\"The Doors of Perception\\", Aldous Huxley explores the almost intangible areas of human perception and the vehicles that he believes will allow us to arrive there.  Rather than relying on dry scientific research, Huxley delves deeper explaining the expansion of his own perception through his experimentation with mescaline.  In describing his own activities and thoughts while under the influence of mescaline, he highlights its potential and boundaries.  Rather than focusing simply on the psychedelic effects of his rendezvous with mescaline, Huxley uses his own state of mind to explore the mentality of others he believes to be toying with the boundaries of human perception (largely musicians and artists).  Huxley proposes that the human mind is limited by a \\"reducing valve\\" that slows the flow of information in order to prevent being overwhelmed by the sensory experience of humanity.<br /><br />Perhaps the most profound aspect of \\"The Doors of Perception\\" is Huxley's position on the use of mescaline as a means of allowing a wider array of people to experience a fully realized perception of the human existence.  Huxley's writing is intriguing and opens up a line of thought as it clarifies the edges of the human experience.  He is waxing poetic as he describes his own experience and highlights the importance of deviations from our daily state of our mind.  \\"The Doors of Perception\\" is a cult classic for a reason.  Huxley describes elements of the human mind that are still controversial.  His ability to link expanded human consciousness with experiences that we have at least touched upon briefly makes his writing easy to relate to.

0385504225|4.0|I have read all of Dan Brown's books so far.  I like them all.  Like the others, this one is an easy and enjoyable book to read.  His writing flows nicely and is descriptive enough for me to paint good pictures of the locations in my head even though I have never been there.  After seeing the movie of Angles and Demons the sets were just as I pictured them.      I say forget about all the people who try to analyze the books or get up in arms about the religious implications.  This, and his other books, are just good stories and are fun to read.

B000O1799U|5.0|Instead of going into a synopsis as I've done with other reviews, I'll just make a few remarks.  I knew nothing about this film until four years or so after it was produced.  When I did get a look at it, I was bowled over by the story and how it was executed.  At the core, it's a paraphrasal of the story of Diana Ross during the all-powerful pop reign of the Supremes.  Beyance Knowles delivers an unswerving portrayal of Deena Jones (based directly upon Diana Ross), as she's thrust into the spotlight by a domineering boss, Curtis Taylor Jr. (portrayed by Jamie Foxx and based on Motown founder Berry Gordy Jr.), then breaks out on her own while coming to the aide of her lead-singing predecessor, Effie White (delivered by Jennifer Hudson and based on Etta James, Aretha Franklin and the Supremes' Florence Ballard).  The presentation is incredibly believaable and hard to tear away from, once you're there.<br /><br />There is one historical reference not noted by other viewers and reviewers, but one I noticed almost from the first time I watched this film.  Towards the end of this picture, the Curtis Taylor character begins to hover over the Deena character appears to be a paraphrasal of the relationship between Ike and Tina Turner.  Despite being devoid of actual physical altercations, that doesn't stop Curtis from ruling Deena's life with a proverbial iron fist.  She records every record he wants her to, and he forces her to star in a film about Cleopatra, even though she wants to appear in a different film.  Then when she leaves him, Deena makes references to letting him have everything she's got, as long as she can start over.  That's precisely what happened with Miss Turner.<br /><br />Edit 1-11-11: One of the conclusions I came to after I first watched this movie is that both its production and its popularity are an indication of the very thing I've been trying to convey to people since I myself began learning to play music in 1994.  The American music industry (especially rock music) is ripe for a reversion to the standards of quality and virtuosity from which the music of this film and its story sprang.  Industry insiders need to be searching for artists and performers harkening back to the popular music of the 60's, 70's and 80's, as opposed to the 90's and afterword.c) is ripe for a reversion to the standards of quality and virtuosity from which the music of this film and its story sprang.

1591843162|3.0|Although this book does contain a lot of excellent content I did find that it was a tad repetitive. I also found that due to the complexity and uniqueness of many of the ideas presented this is not a book that can be read piecemeal. You really need to sit down and dedicate a good amount of time to it at any sitting.<br /><br />What impressed me the most was the challenge that Seth makes here to what is the common belief. His ability to challenge that really makes you think about the subject in more depth. In many ways this will be a book that I will have to read it a number of times to gain the full impact of the wisdom that it imparts.<br /><br />If you are looking for a book that will challenge the way you think about your business or your career then I suggest this should be a book to put on your reading list. Even though you may find it initially abstract and uninteresting I urge you to read on and break through much of the conventional think that is limiting your development.<br /><br />This book will make you think outside the square and challenge your preconceived ideas of modern business.
B00002MZ4V|5.0|His music is so recognizable and memorable from movies I had to buy this.  The selection of songs and recording quality is great.  And listening to the songs reminds me of the great movies they are from.
B002ZG980U|5.0|The movie reminds me of [[ASIN:B00005JMJG Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind (Widescreen Edition)]] et al., but then again not really. It's maybe on its own. The plot contains complexities that are detailed in others'reviews, but not that thought- provoking in a way because most of the characters are brilliantly created to be able to explain events. There are no \\"what-just-happened?\\" moments which are annoying at times. You do have to make-up your mind in some areas but it is not forced nor easy. Thoroughly enjoyable both for the mind and eyes. On a side note I'd like to cast Cillian Murphy as Francisco d'Anconia if Atlas Shrugged would ever be made into a film or a miniseries.
B002ZG980U|4.0|OMG!  What if . . . you and I were business competitors, and what if YOU were the only one standing in my way of being Numero Uno?  What if, I could somehow get into your mind --- into your dreams --- and convince you to sell off or split up your company?  WOW!  Holy Schmidt!<br /><br />This is an awesome movie.  It really keeps your mind tuned in.  It's weird, but very, very interesting.  It is also futuristic in concept.<br /><br />DiCaprio is Cobb, working with the \\"inception\\" of dream concepts into someone's mind.  To do this, there is a network of people involved.  Someone is a architect of the actual dream, and there are several team members who also participate, beside the person being manipulated.  This is quite an operation and the variables are quite interesting and many can be unexpected.  To do the ultimate Inception, you have to go \\"3 layers deep\\" into the dream world - most dangerous- a dream within a dream within a dream.  Also, COBB is quite obsessed with his dead wife and constantly seeing projections of her.  He can't quite let her go emotionally, which makes it a little tough for him to stay focused. He also can't go back home to see his children because the police think he killed her.<br /><br />There is lots of action, car chases, and excitement.  Cool movie.  I think you will likely want to watch it more than once.  You'll also notice Michael Kane in a small supporting role.

B001C4AFOY|5.0|I saw this in a small local arts theatre and enjoyed it so much I had to have a copy.  I did not know too much about Queen Victoria and after watching this have gone on to read more about her.  She was quite the lady, very intelligent and adventurous and one of the more interesting and brilliant royals.  You cannot watch this just once.  This is a DVD that you will have to watch several times to get the full value.  Each time I have watched it I have discovered something else that I had missed previously.  It's a wonderful movie and I enjoyed and continue to enjoy it immensely.
B002ZG9968|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie...pretty entertaining. I wasn't expecting it to be this good or funny to be honest. JLO is funny & Alex is hot. I think they both did a great job with their acting...love their chemistry. I will be buying this when it comes out on DVD & Blu-ray for sure. Give it a try!
B002FL3JA0|2.0|Since Kindle/iPad has no search function, The Real Book VI is very cumbersome on an iPad. You can bookmark desired pages, but the bookmarks indicate page numbers, not song titles. Finding a particular tune involves making a separate written index of titles by page number. (And, by the way, it's not returnable.)
0375842209|4.0|The format of this book was a bit daunting in the beginning but as I got into it I began to enjoy it. Not one of the best books ever, but nevertheless interesting abd worth the time spent.  I have read quite a few books on WWI, the Jews and persecutions.  This one gave a different viewpoint and although it is fiction, the conditions it describes were believable.
0061122416|5.0|A few years ago, I started to read this book but failed to finish it. From what I remember, the first part of the book did not leave any strong impression. However, when I picked up this book again last month, my friends, who actually lent me this book, told me, \\"Once you are into this book, you won't be able to stop reading it.\\" And here I am. That was exactly what I felt! By the last part of the first chapter, I found myself thinking, \\"Man! I can't stop reading this book!\\"    The story starts at a far Arabic country. A boy dreams of finding treasure in far place, Egypt, where he has never been. At first he doesn't take it seriously. He then meets a gypsy, an old king, and the alchemist who eventually helped him to recognize that he needs to go find his treasure, his goal. On the way, he finds so many people who have personal goals in their life. But at some point, the people began to lose their strong desire, and settle for their current life. Learning from many people, the boy continues on his journey.    The most impressive thing for me was that the author really wanted to teach an important lesson through this book. Truly, many people have their own dream. However, not many people really achieve it. The alchemist told Santiago, \\"When a person really desires something, all the universe conspires to help that person to realize his dream.\\"  This amazing teaching inspires the reader to remember his or her dream, that he or she may have already forgotten. Eventually, it leads us to pursue those old, but precious dreams. The alchemist also said, \\"Remember that wherever your heart is, there you will find your treasure. You've got to find the treasure, so that everything you have learned along the way can make sense.\\"  When I was reading those two parts, I felt goose bumps on my arms. How amazingly he described the secret lessons that help us through life! As the boy carries a stronger hope within him, I felt that I also began to have a hope for my own goals in life.I'm certain that anyone who carefully reads this book will feel the very same way I felt.

B003EYVY04|2.0|The Extras are nice....sure.  But the reason I bought the first two Ultimate Editions was primarily to own extended editions of the films.  Warner Brothers is stating that they asked the directors if they wanted to make directors cuts and they both said no.  I find that just idiotic.   With all that extra footage....and I hear there is a lot....forget the directors.  Have a disc of the original and then just make and extended edition without the directors' inputs.  People love extended editions and would pay to see them on this package.  Just look at the negativity surrounding the Lord of the Rings release.  Many, many people would not buy it because it was not the extended editions.  Same thing will apply here.  I guarantee this will not sell nearly as well as the first two editions primarily because of the lack of an extended version.  When will these companys learn?  NO SALE!!!!!

So sad to lose those voices.

B002HJ9PTO|3.0|Mic works great, but they don't tell you in the specs that it is mono, not stereo. You would think that would be in the bullet point features. So I plugged this in to my Kodak Zi8 to shoot videos, and it works great, except, my sound all comes out one channel mono. Not good. If this mic was listed as mono, I wouldn't have bought it. I need stereo. Other than that, it works fine.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|JAWS (1975), IMHO, is the best film in the 1970s. That's my story and I'm sticking to it! And I'm not just coming up with this. I've thought this to be the case for a very long time. Spielberg's timeless tale of a New England island terrorized by a maneating shark is the seminal Hollywood blockbuster. It's got something that EVERYONE can latch onto and enjoy...a wealth of great characters, suspense, drama, thrills, action, adventure. The genius of Steven Spielberg's early works is that he managed to make us part of the action, the same way that Alfred Hitchcock did, but I dare say that Spielberg upped the ante quite a bit because films of the 70s had a palpability and realism that the primary filmmaking career of Hitchcock (the 40s and 50s) just weren't allowed to possess. I mean, as much as I love NORTH BY NORTHWEST and Cary Grant's performance in that film, I cannot see myself as upper crust classy businessman Roger Thornhill and envision going through the incredulous situation that he went through. I just reviewed Spielberg's debut masterwork DUEL and can TOTALLY see myself in David Mann's situation, as can a LOT of people!     To a somewhat lesser extent (but not by very much), perhaps many of us cannot see ourselves in the EXACT situtation that Chief Martin Brody (essayed perfectly by Roy Scheider) is in in JAWS, but many of us can IDENTIFY with Brody and the Amity residents as they live in fear of the dreaded maneater waiting in the waters for them. \\"Fear\\" is a running emotion throughout JAWS; the results of the shark's actions (immediate and after-the-fact) are scarier than seeing the creature itself. Layers of character are revealed throughout JAWS. The fisherman Quint (brilliantly played by Robert Shaw, who should have received Oscar for Best Supporting Actor) starts out turns tough, rough, and seemingly without humanity, then blows us away with his USS Indianapolis story and we see a different side of this man. Oceanographer Matt Hooper (played with perfect aplomb and humor by Richard Dreyfuss) seems like nerdy pushover at first, but shows that he can verbally go toe to toe with the likes of Quint and the town Mayor, and shows major courage in daring to go face to face with the deadly shark in the shark cage. The 3 men represent different sides of masculinity and at various points in the film, their character traits rub off on each other to an extent. Is there any other movie in film history with 3 such well-rounded, diverse LEAD characters that complement each other so well?...Nope!     Modern filmmakers of summer movies ought to watch early Spielberg just to see how to handle not just lead actors, but also supporting characters and extras as well. Not to mention to see how to perform \\"on location\\" shooting. The cinematography in JAWS puts you right there along with the characters. And Spielberg films (especially his earlier ones) are editing masterworks; no wasted shots and the perfectly timed cuts to accentuate the action and tension. Most newer summer blockbuster type films with shooting on location don't seem to have this quality; maybe it's the focus more on using CGI (even good CGI still can't mask the fact that it's CGI!) even in realistic settings; whatever it is, I rarely ever get the sense of really being in that place when I'm watching newer films. Whenever I watch JAWS, I feel like I'm right there with these guys battling that shark!    The story of JAWS is so simple, yet is told with such forthright confidence and clarity that it comes across a lot deeper than many more \\"complex\\" films. The leads Scheider, Shaw, Dreyfuss all rule in their roles, but at the same time, they don't try to outdo each other or the \\"lesser\\" actors in the film. The 2 major supporting actors, Lorraine Gary as Mrs. Brody and Murray Hamilton as the town mayor are just as authentic as the main characters. The woman who plays the grieving Mrs. Kitner shines in her brief scene (the most emotional, authentic scene of the entire film).As impressive as Spielberg was with the pulse-pounding seagoing shark-chasing moments in the last act, I was equally impressed with the way he incorporated and handled these \\"little\\" moments, which are a huge reason why JAWS still holds up all these years later. I've found over the years that when everything seems \\"real\\", no matter how simple the story, a lot more can be gained from the moviegoing experience. And that is a testament to how much effort and work was put into the process. Eat your heart out modern filmmakers...there will never be another Steven Spielberg!
B003V4SF0O|5.0|I've always been a fan of music that crosses genres.  Artists like Mike Phillips who mixes hip hop and jazz so well, or the Finnish band \\"Apocalyptica\\" who play heavy metal on Cellos.<br /><br />And of course the \\"Hip Hop Violinist\\" herself, Miri Ben Ari who has been featured with such hip hop artists as Kanye West, Scarface, Talib Kweli, Akon, Styles P and others.<br /><br />I first listened to the snippets of the album, because as much as I love this kind of thing, it's often very hit or miss.  For every Miri Ben Ari or Apocalyptica there's a whole slew of others that make you want to burn your ears off.<br /><br />After listening to three snippets, I immediately bought it.  Even if it had been 10 dollars I would have gotten it, because this is really good music.<br /><br />He covers a wide range of Rock music from Nirvana (Smells Like Teen Spirit) and Guns N'Roses (November Rain) back to Aerosmith (Walk this way) and Led Zeppelin (Kashmir), and also throws in some classical classics such as Beethoven's 5th and Toccata.<br /><br />I remember the first time I heard Apocalyptica was while viewing the film \\"Your Friends and Neighbors\\" in the theater while living in Charlottesville Virginia.  I heard them playing Metallica songs on Cellos during the opening and closing credits and was amazed.  I had never heard anything like that before.<br /><br />I felt that again while listening to Garrett's album because I think even though I've heard this type of thing before, it's still something that takes me aback.  It's not something you hear every day.  You don't turn on the radio and hear this.  You tend to hear the same 10-25 songs a day (several times a day) and there's very little exposure to true artists like Garrett.<br /><br />One of the definite highlights of this album has to be, hands down, his track \\"Vivaldi vs. Vertigo\\" in which he  brilliantly mashes up the classical Vivaldi with U2's \\"Vertigo\\".  I actually listened to this several times and just marveled at how great it worked together.<br /><br />Also his performance of Aerosmith's Walk this way was a powerhouse due to Garrett's fiery violin playing, and the guitars of Orianthi, who was featured in Michael Jackson's \\"This is It\\" movie).<br /><br />Garrett, who studied at Julliard under the legendary wings of Itzhak Perlman, shines brightly on this album, and I imagine that he's got a great career ahead of him.<br /><br />If you enjoy creative and highly enjoyable music, then this album is for you.  The great thing about this album, and others like it, is it really shows you that there's no more lines in music.  There's nowhere you can't go.<br /><br />There are no more limits. The only limitation is your imagination and your creativity and your abilities.  As the famous quote says, \\"If you can dream it, you can achieve it\\".<br /><br />And no better example of that lies at the heart of this album.erosmith's Walk this way was a powerhouse due to Garrett's fiery violin playing, and the guitars of Orianthi, who was featured in Michael Jackson's \\"This is It\\" movie).

0307592839|3.0|At first I was intrigued by the subject matter, the use of time, the off-beat quality to all the characters.  And then about two thirds into it, I found myself running out of steam.  Mostly I think the characters never gripped me.  They amused and tantalized but nothing more than that.<br /><br />What's it about?  Music and time and mostly Sasha who seems to hover over every moment of the book, a sort of Lulu for the new millenium.<br /><br />Then we got to the power point chapter and while I enjoyed her use of the medium I did think it was showing off and so artificial as to be annoying.  Would a 12 year old really bother with Powerpoint?  Texting I can see but Powerpoint seems so corporate and mainstream.  That chapter captured my take on, \\"A visit from the Goon Squad\\" which is that I admired the risk, the style and the theme but always felt outside of the action, never emotional engaged.  And I'm not asking to love a book - hate, envy, guilt, discomfort is something but in this case I felt next to nothing.
B000W4D94I|3.0|Twister is a good example of a film made purely to showcase special effects with a very simple plot concocted to hold it all together. I wouldn't have minded had it not been pure soap opera nonsense. I expect more from Michael Crichton.<br /><br />I first (and last) saw Twister at a preview screening on a sunny Saturday night on July 20th 1996 (exactly 14 years ago today). It was one of those lovely screenings where the movie just starts right away and you're not bothered by long ads or trailers. After such brilliant teaser trailers I was initially let down by the mechanical and pedestrian nature of the story.<br /><br />The story outside of the twisters ain't nothing new. A man and his estranged wife get back together amid the chaos. Wow! As if that wasn't done in Die Hard, The Abyss and ID4 already. Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt are good (as is her fondness for going without a bra in a white vest with lots of rain pouring down) but the rest of the cast are just scenery. Jamie Gertz is the perfunctory \\"in\\" for the audience. And why Cary Elwes attempted to do a Texas accent when he is clearly incapable is beyond me. And don't get me started on Philip Seymore Hoffman! I wanted one of the twisters to drop a silo on his head. All the storm chaser team do is go \\"yeah\\", \\"let's do this\\" and \\"rock 'n' roll\\". Usually in movies a cast this large is killed off one by one, but no such luck here. Not only are they mostly useless to the story progression but they are deeply annoying.<br /><br />Where the film does succeed is delivering spectacle. The effects may be well over a decade old now but they still look good and the sound design is quite brilliant. If you go to Twister looking for anything else you'll be sorely disappointed.<br /><br />Still, as modern disaster movies go, it's towards the top of the pile.

0545123283|5.0|Taken from Princess Bookie<br />(hardcover edition)<br /><br />My Thoughts:  After reading Shiver, I did not think I could be more blown away! I was wrong! Linger is even better! We are reintroduced to Sam and Grace. I love how the story shifts back and forth between four different point of views! We also get to know Cole and Isabel better. With each word of Linger, it brings me back to the beautiful love story between Sam and Grace from Shiver. Throughout this book we learn more and more about each character. Sam is working at the bookstore, living in Beck's place. Cole is shifting from wolf to boy. Cole was chosen to take Sam's place in Shiver. We learn more about Cole such as he used to be in a band, a really popular band. Isabel and Cole have really good chemistry. Part of me hopes they end up together. I love the first time they met, he was naked in her house!<br /><br />Grace's parents catch Sam in Grace's bedroom and forbid her from seeing him. Like she doesn't have enough to deal with, she starts to get sick and faces problems of her own.<br /><br />I can't really say much else without giving away spoilers. Linger was just as brilliant as Shiver and you need to read it as soon as possible. You'll never believe the ending. Part of me was happy, part of me was sad. The tables are turned and its devastating to the say the least.<br /><br />Shiver and Linger are such beautiful books!<br /><br />Overall: Loved it! Just as great as Shiver, maybe even a tad better. I still love Sam and Grace together. I am even starting to like Cole!<br /><br />Cover: Its cute, green isn't really my color, but its still neat.<br /><br />What I'd Give it:<br />5/5 cupcakes

Overall, the quality of the product is very good, it looks nice and It feels good and looks \\"cool\\" on the arm. I decided to turn the iPod upside down when wearing it to psychologically make it so the iPod will not fall off + the earphone bud plugin is also facing up and makes it a straighter shot for the earphone cord to go from the machine to my ears (personal preference)... Good luck...

Juliett manages to detonate the nuke in 1977.... which should have prevented the plane from crashing in 2004.... right....wrong....  the episode does give us a glimpse of what might have happened if the plane hadn't crashed.... a new reality is formed & we see the characters all going about their normal lives as the plane lands at LAX, this did seem like a neat premise... but it soon gets a bit ridiculous.... like the writers just didn't know where to go with it    then, to top it all off, we learn that the nuke sent our survivors back to 2007....how?? & now we have two realities going on at once.....make sense??...    In the alternate never crashed timeline (flash sideways), we see charaters from previous episodes pop up, but there are inconsistencies....like..    Sun & Jin are not married in the flash sideways..(how?)    Jack, our main hero suddenly has a son who was never mentioned in the first five seasons, too add insult to injury, his ex-wife is not even the kid's mother, Juliett is.....how is this possible??    Sawyer.... the show's bad boy....who we learned was con man, but now a undercover police officer with Miles, one of the rescue people in Season 4 as his partner... how is this possible?....    Ben...the show's villian & the main antagonist throughout we learned killed his own dad on the island in season 3 in a flashback moment, but somehow, his dad is a old man here...how?..not only that, they try to make us like him....    Desmond would have been on the island in this flash sideways in the Hatch no less, but yet, somehow he too is on the plane...again...how is this possible??....now one could argue that he was never there because of the nuke, that is possible, but how likely is it he would have been on the plane..not likely...    Hurley is a CEO of the resturaunt that he worked at before hitting the lottery in the flashbacks of his character.... again....how?...    Locke is still engaged to his girlfriend who had left him in a previous flashback episode from season 3....but somehow that never happened...also his reason for being handicapped is also different....I won't even try to explain it..    Only Kate, Claire, Sayid, & Charlie seem to have a consistent flow in this flash sideways...    With Claire still pregnant with her unborn child  Kate still on the run from the law  Sayid being reunited with his long lost love    another thing this season tried to do was explain the Smoke Monster's origin, we learn that it is the MIB (Man in Black) who has an ongoing fued with Jacob(the Island's protector)....almost like Jesus & Satan....with the MIB wanting to leave the island & Jacob refusing to let him leave....but get this.... they are brothers....o.k....but we never find out why the MIB wants to leave...    Early on we are introduced to a group of people in a Pyramid type building who are keeping Smokey out, but we never learn why....let alone where they came from...    There is only one really good episode..the name eludes at the moment, where we learn about Richard & why he never ages, we also learn in this episode how the ship came to be stuck in the jungle, this s why I give it two stars.    This Season is so inconsistent with the other previous seasons that the writers had to be on crack......it is as if creator J.J. Abrams & others here just handed it to Damon Lindelof & Carlton Cuse & said... \\"here, it is yours to finish\\"  & these idiots could'nt come up with a reasonable ending....    Like some reviewers have said....it could have ended with Season 5 with them resetting time, that would have been believeable.... & as far as I am concerned....that is where it ended... I will not be getting this one...& I won't even get started on the last episode which was supposed to justify all the inconsistencies that for the most part was a cop out like others have said, I won't even go there.....other reviewers have already done that for me....stick with the first five seasons.....skip this one.
B000B5XOY8|5.0|I've seen this 1989 version many times throughout the past 10 years and after 20 years the older Batman Movie still holds up well. Now, we all know about all these \\"new transfers\\" coming out to improve sound and picture quality from the original transfer to DVD. If your a fan of this 1989 Batman pitch the 1999 DVD version and get this one!<br /><br />I've of often said that Tim Burton's movies are indeed dark but the 1999 transfer is not just dark but very grainy compared to the sharp resolution of the this new 2009 transfer. I highly recommend it! It's like going into the theater and watching it again. The sound is also are major improvement. I must! Go get the 2009 transfer now!
B0000E64TQ|4.0|Great disc originally and now even better.  Sounds excellent at home on my SACD player, pretty good in the car.  A bit bassey in the car but other than that a fine trade up from the original CD recording that was put out some 20 years ago.  I have them both and play them side by side and can really hear the SACD difference.  Well worth replacing the original and upgrading to SACD players!
1410407853|5.0|I recently read John Steinbeck's \\"Travels With Charley\\", which I also highly recommend. Though I've seen the movie, \\"Grapes of Wrath\\", many times I decided to read the book. It is exquisite literature and the kind of writing we do not see enough of these days with formulated novels that are, in fact, screen plays waiting to happen. I encourage anyone who has reverence for words, to read this stunning novel for every word, line, and paragraph yields  a poetic depth, understanding, and insight into an important part of our country's history.
0545123283|5.0|I preordered the book and had to wait a little over a month to get it. It just came in the mail today!
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my nephew and I couldn't wait to give it to him so I could see it!  It's great, especially in Blu-ray.  I would definitely recommend getting the entire series.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|And it probably would have if he had done this one back in the early to mid 90's when people were falling all over themselves with his \\"Jerry MaGuire\\" this one is by far one of Cruise's best, if not the best performance of his whole career, In this he is Vincent, an aging hitman who has five hits he has to make in one night in Los Angeles, but it is clear he is not familiar with the city & enlists the services of a cab with Jamie Foxx as the unsuspecting cab driver who shuttles him around as he makes his hits, the first one goes horribly wrong as the victim falls out of a window & lands on the top of the cab no less, it is here that Foxx realizes what is going on &  Vincent has no choice but to involve him in his hits, as they load the body into the trunk, the next hit is successful, but when Vincent leaves Foxx handcuffed to the stirring wheel, some punks try to rob him & steal Vincent's breifcase containing his hitlist, this is cool moment as Vincent intervines & immediately takes out the punks so fast that you have to see it to beleive it in a rather satisfying moment, the third hit is a bit more sad, all this action draws the attention of the local police as we learn that Vincent's hits are those of people slated to testify at a criminal trial, Mark Ruffulo(13 Going on 30) is on hand as a cop following Vincent's mayhem with Peter Berg as his reluctant partner who it seems just doesn't care about these victims, the fourth hit is a bit more tense as Vincent sets his sights on the victim in a nightclub full of patrons & this victim's security force, with Ruffalo & many Swat team members attempting to save the guy, all hell breaks loose in a scene that is a bit diffucult to describe, you just have to watch it, Vincent of course makes his kill & quietly leaves amid frantic people running in all directions, his last kill is a lawyer leading the case, Jade Pinkett Smith is the attourney who is the last target, who Foxx had met early on in the film's opening moments, Foxx soon realizes this & attempts to stop Vincent in which a cat & mouse game ensues between the three of them with a rather satisfying ending, again, this one should have gotten Tom Cruise an Oscar, his Vincent is so cool & reserved that you actually forget that this is Cruise playing the part, Cruise embodies this character in a way that you  just forget that it is him in the role, this was definately a step away from the roles that Cruise usually plays, & like him or hate him, you have to give him credit for taking on an unconventional role, somthing that most actors are afraid to do, if the Media & Hollywood hadn't turned on him as they have now turned on Mel Gibson, I believe he would have been nominated by the Academy.... don't be put off by your dislike for Cruise, this is one great film, & director Michael Mann once again makes Los Angeles come alive, just like in his other film \\"Heat\\" Los Angeles becomes a charater here too, the city never looked better at night.
B003ICWTR4|5.0|This is the best Bruce Springsteen DVD out there on the market.  Great film from afternoon into evening.  Springsteen is soaking wet after just 4 songs, what a performer!  Saw 2 of his shows on his last tour excellent stuff.  The band is top notch form here, Max plays the drums with unrestrained abandon. Nils Lofgren is still a great guitarist, and still jumpin' around after hip surgery, great interplay between Bruce and Stevie Van Zandt during the whole concert.  On the song \\"Out In The Streets\\", Bruce goes down in front of the crowd and has to get back up the stairs and states \\"Give me a f---ing elevator, i'm 60!\\" classic.  This is one of the best concert disc i've seen and you can get it for only $15 or less.  Let's hope Bruce doesn't wait to many more years for his next rockin' album and tour.<br />  The Band: Bruce Springsteen guitar-vocals-Harmonica<br />  Roy Bittan -Keyboards<br />  Clarence Clemons - Sax BV and Harmonica<br />  Nils Lofgren -Guitar BV<br />  Garry Tallent -Bass<br />  Stevie Van Zandt - Guitar BV<br />  Max Weinberg - Drums<br />  Soozie Tyrell - Violin BV<br />  and Charlie Giordano - Keyboards- Accordion ex-Pat Bentar member 1982-1988.
B000BT97AO|5.0|I heard about this \\"amazing\\" movie from more than a few of my friends. I bought it on good faith because I absolutely LOVED Labyrinth and The Dark Crystal as a kid. When I asked a friend to describe it to me all she could say was \\"Well, there is no way to describe it other than eye candy... or kind of like Tim Burton on anti-depressants on a really good day\\". With that shaky testimony in line I ordered it and kept my fingers crossed...   But oh my was I surprised! I was forewarned about the \\"animation\\" and cinematography style of the movie, so that didn't come as a surprise (because I was warned I wasn't turned off right away like I normally would have been) but after a few mins of adjustment I immediately fell in love with it. It is a unique story of a girl that finds herself in the world that she herself created through drawings and her adventure on finding her way home. It is super cute and creative and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for something unique to sink their teeth into. It is written by Niel Gaiman and in creativity I would rate it right behind Coroline. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
1584282584|5.0|This is well written and easy to follow. I definitely would recommend to fellow photographers looking to better their lighting skills
B001U0HBPQ|4.0|I like this movie very much.  It's such a different kind of story about a man aging backwards and the special effects are fabulous.  Brad Pitt does a really good job as Benjamin Button and Kate Blanchet is wonderful in her role as well.  This movie will (at least it did with me) remind you a little along the line of Forrest Grump.  It's funny, sad, and tender.
B0036TGSR6|5.0|Brilliant, very well done. Elegant intrigue mastered by great actors. Unfolding gradually to make this political thriller a movie that will remain. Any resemblance to reality and any relations to Mr. Polansky's recent hurdle with swiss/American deceitfulness would be pure coincidence.
B002ZG9846|5.0|I have to admit the title put this film on the back burner for me because I thought it was going to be a waste.  Thank goodness for fan reviews.  They were so good that I gave it a try and (as another reviewer wrote) saw this twice at the theaters--three times if you count the dollar theater.  Two stand out reasons to see this film:  1. The dialogue is cleverly funny; 2. Chloe Grace Moretz as Hit Girl.  I look forward to my purchase of this film on Blu-Ray.  The only thing missing is some out-takes of Hit Girl's stunts, it would have been enjoyable to see her train.
0981951244|5.0|I ordered the combo pack direct from Success which had the audio CD set as well.   This book is dead on. I've read the book once and am listening to the audio set for the third time.  This is great advice from someone who not only talks the talk, he walks the walk. Darren is the real deal.    If you don't read Success magazine I encourage you to subscribe to it as well.   Don't just read it. Read it and let it soak in! All of the info is from top notch people. It's life changing information and advice.
0307577589|5.0|I listened to this book as I drove cross-country in July.  This murder mystery is so intense and the writer so skilled that the miles just flew by.  He creates unusual yet believable characters in a web of storylines that keep the suspense level high through the entire book.  I was so engrossed in the story that I immediately bought the others in the trilogy.  These books are not to be missed.  The only down side is that he isn't with us to write more.  Stieg Larsson is now one of my favorite writers.
B0000VD04M|4.0|I love this movie.  Johnny Depp is awesome!  Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi is Incredible!  I believe he may have won an Oscar for his role.  There are many celebrities in this film and they all do a great job.  The movie is sometimes a little sad but mostly very, very, funny.  It's also an interesting story about the life of filmmaker Ed Wood Jr.
0670451495|5.0|This is a wonderful book for young children.  It was my grandsons' most favorite.  We read it to them over and over until they were able to read it themselves.  It is also ageless.
B002MLYA0G|5.0|I live in the United States.  If you are one of the big fans of this film and did NOT like the new subtitles, buy the UK version.  Luckily I have a friend in the UK and I did a quick purchase from UK online, sent to his address, and he sent it to me.  The back does read, \\"Region B\\" but it plays on my Samsung blu-ray player.  There is no English dubbing, but most original fans prefer the theatrical subtitles.  This one has it.  The video quality does not come out at you as some movies, but the quality improvement over the regular DVD is quite visible.  When buying, look for the cover on this photo, it's the \\"Right One\\" (pun intended).
B002QGUFWE|5.0|I think it's Great...If you like Lady GAGA it's Great! - if you don't I think there is a lot of prejudice in music. I wish her video's were also included...Go GAGA
B003KUSUG8|5.0|If you had any doubts... after Encore and Relapse, get rid of them. Eminem is back and might be better than ever. If anything he is close to the Slim Shady from the old days.
B000O76T8Q|5.0|I love this movie!  I've always been fascinated with the possibility of creatures from another world and this combined with the ocean makes for a great movie.  Visually stunning and great special effects.  I especially loved the commentary in text form that's on the movie and you also get the original theatrical version as well as the Special Edition movie with 28min. of additional footage.  It's a beautifully shot movie.  A MUST HAVE for a DVD collector!
B000001ELF|5.0|Good grief--- I bet Gene, Paul and Peter would even agree that Ace's album was the best!  Is there any question about that?    Ace's solo album made it soooooooooo obvious that Ace WAS KISS.  Without Ace= no KISS.    I would go so far as to say Ace's solo album is a must-have for any fan of metal.  It totally cooks, trust me.  I'm 55 and I've heard a lot of rock and roll. But there's no one like Ace.
B002VPE1XY|4.0|The AmazonBasics case means what it says:  it is a well-fabricated, resilient basic case for your smaller digital cameras.  To be perfectly candid, we haven't quite found a digital camera that it fits perfectly; our oblong or asymmetrical Fujifilm FinePix XP10 and Canons can get in, but it is a challenge to get the flap snapped shut.  For this price you are getting a great carrying case, but just make sure you actually have a camera that matches it.
B003405MF6|4.0|Beck's album is truly amazing, and I particularly like the mix of almost classical music with more rock influenced tracks. it is surprising what he can do with an electric guitar. His guitar sound is so pure and beautiful that it often sounds like the human voice.  However, I don't like the vocal tracks by Joss Stone because they hide, rather than showcase the guitar work.  I don't get it why they are on this album.  The other vocal tracks work and create an interesting dialogue between voice and e-guitar.
B001GCUO16|2.0|If you're looking for a movie adaptation of the origins and overall tragedy that is Wolverine then you have to wait until they make that movie. This movie is very,very,very inaccurate of Wolverine's history. I would say they got 10% right and the other 90% they made up on the spot... I suppose if you have no knowledge of wolverines history then this film might be acceptable to you. But fans of the comics know this is not wolverine. First of all if you want to make a wolverine movie then you have to accept that it's going to be bloody and then you have to rate the movie \\"R\\". I don't think I saw a single drop of blood even when wolverine was slashing people left and right. What I don't get, is they could have stayed true to wolverines' actual history and strife and still have a better movie than this. The laymen's would have been happy as well as the hardcore fans. I hope they don't mess up the upcoming Deadpool movie like this fiasco, god help marvel if they do.
B002RKRTGO|1.0|this book is missing parts from chapter 2. You can read the missing contents for free on wikipedia.
1401207529|5.0|This was a great graphic novel all around.  It has all the elements of great artwork and great writing that you could hope for.  It's still great after all these years.
0670033375|4.0|If one has no familiarity with why societies collapse, this is a \\"must read.\\"  The author identifies five central causasional factors, not all of which apply in every instance, nor appy equally when all are present. Depending on the instance, some do not apply at all.  In painstaking detail, a number of past (now disappeared) societies are analyzed, then several modern (still extant) societies.  One cannot help thinking about one's own society -- that of the United States -- while reading this book.  But of course, more than ever today, all current organized societies are inextricably part of one grand global society.  That situation exponentially increases the influences of the factors causing collapse of any one or all of the globally linked groups/countries. This is a book that will leave the reader with a clear paradigm for use in examining current health and life of existing cultures, so that more sense can be made of the socio-political-economic world in which we live.
B000UQRSMM|5.0|I read this book years a go when I was trying to understand why there is so much violence in the world. I came across it while living abroad and thought it looked very interesting. I am just finishing a Master's Degree in history and out of all the books I read throughout my life, this book by far taught me the most about acceptance, understanding and tolerance. I wrote a million and one notes throughout the book and still utilize the concepts to this day. I think this book is great for a ten year old to read or a ninety year old. Grasping many different concepts at different ages is the beauty behind the Tao of Pooh.
1582701709|4.0|I am enjoying reading this book.  I'm not quite finished reading it, but I can say it is truly inspirational.
B001FB55L2|1.0|If it were not for the completely bogus military portions of this movie, maybe it would have been good.  I took the dvd out when the Cpt bludgeoned his soldier to death to save himself.  Bull.    The body of these two were not recovered, so they would not have been listed as K.I.A. in the first place.  Just because of situations like this and the fact that in todays world, that helicopter crash site would have been found and the bodies recovered.      I can't recommend this movie at all and I will think long and hard before I ever watch Toby Mcquire or Jake Gyllinhaal again in a movie.
B000WYCF6Q|5.0|I have been Using this Mirror for five months and I'm by no means a pro-Lance Armstrong Biker...But I love biking like at-least 20miles once a week. I share the road with lots of tourist and local's coming to the beach and its sometimes good to know their coming up beside me in their automobiles. I have to store my bike so the mirror is easy to take off and folds up when put in my bag. Even better it doesn't scratch up easy when I just toss it in my bag. I had another mirror made by BeLL® and it broke when I set the bike down on the first ride. This Mirror can be placed in a lot of spots on the bike but doesn't stick out or get in the way! I keep it on my left side handle bar and it isn't a big screen but big enough. I also LOVE That it doesn't slip down when I adjust it stays...I don't ride mt. Bike but for road its MY Favorite bike mirror Ever!
0525423842|5.0|I purchased Theodore Boone for my 10 year old grandson.  I enjoy John Grisham's books a lot. There is always suspense and drama with a twist at the end.  Theodore Boone is a young persons suspense and drama written in a way they can understand. My grandson read the book in four days. He now wants to visit a court room.  This book could be the making of a new young lawyer!
0545123283|3.0|I'm still floating between a 3 and 4 stars on this one...<br /><br />Before I officially start---I absolutely hated all aspects of Shiver other than Maggie's writing. Secondly, I love Maggie Stiefvater's writing style, her faerie books (Lament and Ballad, for those interested), and the short stories she posts on her Merry Sisters of Fate blog (everyone, go check it out! MS isn't the only great writer on the blog :]). Unfortunately, her werewolf series, while ingenious and brimming with her excellent sense of prose, falls flat because of two details, both entirely subjective:<br /><br />Characters, and action.<br /><br />Perhaps it's because I'm the type of person who isn't exactly in the \\"teenage mainstream,\\" but I prefer characters who have some quirks, something that pops out and causes me to giggle with delight. Sam and Grace, I need not say, do not fall into this personality category. As in Shiver, they have remained rather disgustingly lovey-dovey, stuck together like glue, perfect, inseparable (other than the whole wolfy thing, would you know). Since their emotional status has been established in the first paragraph of the first book, I found nothing to interest me further in their relationship. Thus, I felt detached almost entirely from Shiver, but did find some saving points in Linger.<br /><br />Mainly, this was because of Cole. Despite the fact that he also falls into the boo-hoo-hoo-y, angsty person category, I enjoyed his cynicism and sneering charm. He was bad-boy done impeccably, and furthermore, interestingly. Although I could recall similarities to him from other books (Jace from His Mortal Instruments, for example), Cole stood on his own two feet. I felt like he progressed as a person throughout the novel, and I experienced his emotions with him (the deer scene in particular, ahhh!). Needless to say, I enjoyed his viewpoint the most--he was a breath of fresh air after the gluey mess of Grace+Sam.<br /><br />The other viewpoint I enjoyed was, surprisingly, Grace's. --MILD SPOILER-- I could finally see her exhibiting traces of backbone. Being a teenager myself, I also felt her frustration against her parents' hand-waving. As a teenager, the need to be understood is at the forefront of our minds, the need for what concerns us most to not be trivialized. Parents at all levels of care tend to shake their heads quite often at their children's passion (understandable, considering their experience), but the feelings of outrage and frustration the \\"wronged\\" teen (although in Grace's case she truly was) feels is written beautifully in Linger. --END MILD SPOILER--<br /><br />I did, however, thoroughly dislike Sam and Isabel's viewpoints. I don't know why, but Isabel never interested me enough to feel as though I needed to go into her brain; Grace's understanding of her character was always enough for me. Furthermore, with the addition of Cole, I simply did not care enough about Isabel to struggle through her quippy, snobby entries. She's interesting, but not that interesting. Sam, on the other hand, is like boredom personified. I do not CARE about the guy. Other than his interesting musings about the cure and the way it made him feel, I simply could not invest anything in him. He stayed pretty much the same throughout Shiver, and he essentially remained that way in Linger (minus the wolfyness, of course). In the end, I skimmed Isabel's sections; skipped Sam's.<br /><br />And finally, the action. Certainly, every scenario allowed the characters to further their relationships with one another, but when you zoom out of the details to take in the big picture, you find that nothing, in essence, happened. (Okay, more than in Shiver, but still not enough to merit almost 400 pages.) Although the complexity of the characters' interpersonal relationships cannot be questioned, I think that the presence of a parallel plot wouldn't have hurt the book. (I mean, think Twilight--although I deplore the book, I think the murders provideda good backset to the \\"blossoming\\" love story.) In Linger, the first 95% of the book consisted of character introduction and exploration, and the last 5% of these characters actually doing something. Personally, I think these should be more evenly interspersed.<br /><br />Despite these flaws, though, I actually did enjoy the book (far more than Shiver, anyhow). It was a good read, and I liked how Maggie delved further into her own werewolf mythology. Her version is really well-done, and I'm eager to see how she finishes the series up. Overall, I don't regret buying the book, and would probably reread it with the same pleasure. I can only wish that some kind of accident will eradicate Sam, to replace him with a less wet-tissue-y lead male (coughColecough). I'm looking forward to the next book...hopefully won't have to wait Forever. (haha, oh, I'm a riot XD)nger, the first 95% of the book consisted of character introduction and exploration, and the last 5% of these characters actually doing something.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|A truly phenomenal show that was mercilessly killed before its time.  Curse you, Fox!  I recommend buying two of these.  It is so good you'll burn a copy out just watching it over and over again.  Also, thanks to Amazon.com for a ludicrously fast delivery.  Had it in three days even with the super saver shipping.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|If you like Serendipity, Notting Hill, The Princess Bride and/or Sleepless in Seattle you will love this movie. It is worth the money to own it, since I have watched and rewatched it many many times. It is a staple in my Christmas Month of Movies.    Kate Winslet is always endearing and powerful as an actress. Her character here is no different. You love her for not being able to leave the futile relationship and her friendship-turned-love relationship with the always enjoyable Jack Black is one to mirror your life on. Cameron Diaz is \\"okay\\" (And I say that with a shrug of the shoulders and a tip of the head.) She never wows me. But here she shares the screen with the effortlessly talented Jude Law which makes their love story one not to miss. He is handsome with a capitol H! And charming as only an Englishman can be.    This movie will make you smile laugh and cry those wonderful tears of movie joy. It will remind you why romantic comedies are an enduring genre and it will remind you that love is possible, even when it looks like all you want to do is cury your head in the covers.
006056251X|5.0|I have recently read all the books in the series. My ranking of them is as below:    A Scandal in Spring (Book 4) - most favorite - 5  It Happened One Autumn (Book 2) tied with The Devil in Winter - both 5's  Secrets of A Summer Night (Book 1) - a strong 4    I really enjoyed this book. LK is a captivating, humorous, strong storyteller. I found the romance and pacing and character development to be quite believable as far as romance books go.     St. Vincent finally found something that he would love doing instead of being a shiftless man-whore dependent on his daddy's money until he had to face being cut-off. Evie finally made the break from her abusive family and matured and finally found strength and confidence in herself. She did have enough strength to break away, but it wasn't until afterward that she had a chance to breathe and learn about herself in situations that weren't heavily and constantly influenced by her horrible family all her life. The chemistry between them was quite palpable and enjoyable from the beginning.     I wasn't disappointed with Cam not teaming up with Daisy in the next book because I already had read The Hathaway series first. Perhaps the author was going to team them up but suddenly had a new idea about starting the new series with one of the plots involving the mystery of two Gypsy brothers who weren't aware of each other's connection. Personally, I like Cam better with Amelia in Mine Till Midnight and Daisy with Matthew in A Scandal in Spring.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Bottom line:  it's awesome.  Scalzi: my new favorite living author.  Arthur C. Clarke: my favorite deceased author.  I don't like war stories so I resisted reading this book for a while but Scalzi uses it only as a backdrop to the in-depth character development.  The book is more about the characters and the tech than the war.  Go Perry!
B003RNXIBK|5.0|In the past few years I have seriously fallen out of love with the Rap genre I grew up on (late 80's early 90's).  There are no more story tellers... I mean, there WERE no more story tellers until this album.  I've never been a fan of Mr. Mathers, but this album will make you a convert.  Even if you don't like rap music his sobering tribute to love, \\"Space Bound\\", actually made me cry the more I listened to it as it made me realize that I've had my heart shattered by someone that I would have willingly blown my brains out for.  The last rap song that made me cry was Ghostface Killah's \\"All That I Got\\", an ode to growing up poor as hell with a mother who doubled as a father.      This album is a MUST HAVE for any fan of MUSIC!
B003HFFVDQ|5.0|This is an extremely solid album, their best in far too many years. I've never been one of those \\"I liked them before they got mainstream and sold out\\" kind of people, because who cares, in all honesty I don't want genius to go unrecognized or unrewarded, but my expectations of artists very often goes unfulfilled: they need to keep the faith. Chemical Brothers veered off course for awhile, but they're finally back on the right path, all cylinders blazing. This is seriously a beautiful album filled with many masterful touches and some fantastic textures.
B001RIY49C|4.0|I just got the T2 Endoskull set and, let me tell you, it's amazing. It looks exactly like you'd expect a Terminator to look. When you press the button on the side, after flicking the on switch on the bottom, the eyes light up red and it plays certain sound clips from the movie. I read some reviews that said the skull was flimsy. I don't know about that. Sure, it's not as sturdy as it would be if it were made from metal, but it's not paper-level flimsy. I wouldn't play with it or anything, but it will certainly hold up to simple holding and looking at. The only bad thing about the set is the incredibly dumb move of having all 6 discs stacked on top of each other. Doesn't everyone know that dvds can get scratched up pretty good. The set does come with a regular dvd case that you can put the discs in, but that too is a stack case. I'd suggest tracking down a 6 disc regular case, sort of like the case of the Real Ghostbusters complete set or the A-Team set and using that instead.
0061186473|3.0|I like Neil Gaiman's work.  I have read most of what is available.  I have sought out his work, I have seen him read live.  I like this particular book, but it is all familiar.  Not familiar in the way that when you read a lot of an author's work you know their patterns and intonations and common themes.  This book is familiar in the way that pretty much everything in it is available in some other publication.<br /><br />I don't know if this collection is better audience-directed than his more complete story collections, but I think Gaiman's audience is anyone that has ever been young at heart, searching for a sense of wonder in their encounters with the world.  Gaiman bring this wonder; he is a master story-teller.  However, you should perhaps seek out [[ASIN:0061450162 Smoke and Mirrors: Short Fictions and Illusions (P.S.)]], [[ASIN:0060515236 Fragile Things: Short Fictions and Wonders]], or [[ASIN:0060530944 The Graveyard Book]].  All these represent a fuller realization of Gaiman's mastery than this title.
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|Once again, Steven Wilson and company deliver a feast for the ears and mind. This album departs from the direction the band seems to have been traveling down with the preceding 2 albums. I was pleasantly surprised and realized that SW and Co.'s sound continues to evolve. What you'll get with this 2-disc set is a smorgasbord of music and sounds. Wilson pulls in various elements from all of his other projects to create a full, rich soundscape to serve as the backdrop of each memorable melody. The first disc is a treat, a multitude of songs revolving around a central theme. The second disc contains stand alone songs, and it has a different feel than the first.<br /><br />I can't comprehend how any music lover would not appreciate The Incident. Like all PT albums, you're not just listening to songs with this album: you're having a musical experience. I recommend you buy this album and give it several listens before allowing your analytical left-brain to critique it to death. Just listen several times over and let the music sink in. I think you'll find that you end up loving what you're experiencing.
0307594777|1.0|I bought the set of 3 Larssons on a good review from Time magazine. I planned to read them on our beach vacation. However, I don't particularly care for human and animal cruelty with some sexual slavery thrown in. I would give these books a 0 star. I threw them all away. Bill
B002MU4NL8|5.0|At the start of the movie I wasn't noticing much difference in the PQ department between the DVD and BD releases. Things got very interesting once the cast and crew were in space. The BD is leagues better than the DVD in clarity; the planets and ships are spectacular in Bluray. The audio is TrueHD and is top notch. I can here everything perfectly; there are no issues with the vocals fading in and out, or the need for subtitles.     Highly recommended, very entertaining and a great addition to your movie library.
0316017922|4.0|I have been skeptical of books based on statistics ever since reading HOW TO LIE WITH STATISTICS (1954) by Darrell Huff while majoring in Economics in College. Huff's small and excellent book gives example after example of how statistics are used to mislead an audience and instructs the reader to see through the smoke of deception. So when I saw that Gladwell uses a lot of case statistics in OUTLIERS and also illustrates his conclusions with individual stories to support his theories I was skeptical. And I must point out that I am still skeptical; however, the analysis that Galdwell provides and his resulting conclusions at least open the mind and remind us that no argument should rest on easy explanations. Gladwell highlights the counter intuitive and provides a pleasant easy to read writing style focusing on a topic everyone wonders about. What happened to create successful people, companies, and institutions and what keeps others who have equal potential struggling? (And he goes into what causes failure and how to fix it as he studies, for example, the major cause of airline crashes.) The bottom line Gladwell maintains is that success is the result of more than an individual pulling himself up by his own initiative (yet that is a key component). But that one also needs the ability to communicate, work with others, luck, opportunity, and it helps to have right cultural background and be born early in the year. This Gladwell reinforces with individual stories of success (and a few failures) of people like Bill Gates, Canadian hockey stars, the Beatles, top New York Lawyers, even Gladwell's own mother. Each story highlights how being in the right place at the right time with a passion to specialize and learn is needed. (For example it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become really great at something.) Gladwell takes his theory to a next level too, like when he tells why in the United States schools have a three month summer vacation and how this impacts achievement results. His solution is that we keep the schools open full time (at least in poor areas) and have longer work days. (Now is that what we are talking about as a solution to education these days of budget cuts?) Bottom line this is an entertaining and interesting book that leads to opening one's mind to the understanding that to be successful you need to work hard, have passion, and also be lucky to be given the chances to discover this passion and recognize those opportunities when they appear.
B0000AR8NK|5.0|OK. First off, I'm not a fan of the Ziggy period. The only good song out of that era is \\"Space Oddity.\\" Bowie doesn't hold my attention until STATION TO STATION.<br /><br />Simply put, REALITY is Bowie's best album since HEROES. Everything works: song writing, arrangement, performance, production. There isn't a weak song on the album.<br /><br />Aside from a couple of bright spots (WHITE TIE, BLACK NOISE and OUTSIDE), HEATHEN signaled the return of Bowie the senior statesman. Both excellent albums, REALITY outshines HEATHEN in many ways.<br /><br />Bowie is clearly one of the most intelligent people in the \\"business.\\" I've always admired artists who are courageous enough to change, even if that change causes them to go through some bumpy roads. For that alone I give Bowie credit for taking his fans through some rough patches. It's nice to see he wound up his career on a very strong note.<br /><br />An excellent companion piece is A REALITY TOUR. The DVD is awesome.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00064AEOC David Bowie - A Reality Tour]]<br /><br />Thanks, Davie.<br /><br />-
0805086846|5.0|The book appealed to me because it had historical content and had a great perspective.
1891252089|5.0|This book is an excellent companion to any Ashtanga practice.  Clearly defines the poses, easy to follow and very informative.  Has even helped when I attend class, when class has moved quickly I know what the pose is from recalling the descriptions and photos in the book.  Love it!
030726999X|5.0|This trilogy is the best in a very long time. I hope the US does NOT plan to remake the excellent Swedish films in the english language. If you cannot read subtitles you do not deserve to see these films based on the novels.
0743486285|5.0|This is a great book!  Especially to someone who is a recovering addict!  You know exactly what he is talking about and going through!
B000063UR2|5.0|This is so much better then the orignal version. I can watch the director's version, which has more suspence, and there is more of a background to the film. I recommend this to everyone, be they are lover of fairy tales or fanatsy films, or Ridley Scott films. It is great!!!!
B001U5V04O|3.0|This was my first opera experience. I could never see the sense in going to an opera without being able to understand the language. :) So I was much depending on the subtitles.     I had researched the available Don Giovanni blurays by reading the reviews to find the one which was the closest to the original (if that is possible), with the best quality video / audio.  I am a former musician, trained in percussion / having played in my early years (10-13) in several local Italian  concert orchestras with much older musicians, an experience that left it's mark on me.  Hence my desire for the best audio experience possible within the limitations of my audio system, which  is connected via optical and supports Dolby 5.1 and DTS.     It was disappointing when the opening D minor chord sounded. I could tell immediately that something was not right and then I noticed the receiver didn't sense either format.    What I hadn't realized, when I researched, was the listing of PCM format.   And the reviews you are reading are not necessarily on the product you are considering. Be very careful  in your research as there are not that many unique Bluray reviews for operatic content and the same reviews appear   on Amazon and across the web for different bluray productions. At $51, it's not as easy to just try another one.  I find this to be misleading and unreliable and I will be more careful next time.    The LPCM 2.0 stereo quality is fine when the receiver decodes it into surround via ProLogic on my system, but if you are connected to the source via optical, you will not experience Dolby 5.1 or DTS. To experience the higher quality LPCM 5.1 audio with this bluray, you must be connected to your audio receiver via HDMI and obviously the receiver must also support the higher quality uncompressed format.    Although it is a great performance, I took off 1 star for lack of additional support for optical DD5.1 and DTS and 1 star for the price.    What I also find strange is, I also purchased Cosi fan Tutte which appears to have been produced by OpusArte in the same year. I was able to listen to that in Dolby 5.1 and the audio quality was excellent!     But I guess it's time to update my receiver.   --------------------    I am including a direct response I received from the OpusArte Authoring House a few days after I wrote the comments above:    In case of discs with 5.1 PCM the BD player/PS3 has to be connected to the amplifier through HDMI or analog 5.1 connection.    If it's connected through SPDIF (which seems to be the case here with your customer) it will be downconverted to 2.0 PCM.     Cosi Fan Tutte has Dolby TrueHD surround audio and in this case he can enjoy surround sound through SPDIF, but not in full quality - he hears a Dolby Digital version.    He needs to connect his PS3 through an HDMI cable to the receiver to be able to enjoy lossless surround audio offered by Blu-ray.
0061122416|5.0|I read this book in a day. It was one of the very few books that I couldn't stop reading. The alagory of the text and the meaning of each plot turn was splendid. What an outstanding book.
B000AP04L0|3.0|This is is funny movie, but doesn't rise to the classic league of movies...the characters are extreme stereotypes of your typical cubical dwellers so common, esp. when the film was made. The movie's main character has to work with this pathetic cast of fellow office dweebs, and the end is a revenge fantasy...    Not sure why the slow-mo parts are in the film at all. Add nothing imho.
B000O599ZS|5.0|Excellent movie for any John Wayne fan. A must add to any John Wayne collection! I don't particularly like Westerns but this one has an interesting story and was easy to follow and not boring.  I would tell anyone to purchase this movie.  I loved it!
1416594787|4.0|It was a very intresting book and is full of information. The book is very complete, well researched and well layed out.It's a very intresting book and well worth reading if your into science, evolution, nature or just want to know more about evolution because it does give's you all the evidence and imformation of evolution that you will need.
0061245097|5.0|I loved it!!! I mean, loved it!!!! I read a few reviews that were not as pleased, but if you liked the first one then you will be very happy with the 2nd. This is not a trashy romance novel. Great Story and Great Characters and one hell of a sex scene!
0545091020|5.0|Cd in new condition and works great. quicker then i expected shipping.  Thank you.
1593082800|5.0|I had never heard of this book or this author until 2 years ago. I learned of it thru a book site I belong to. The book is true mystery!  I advise giving it 50 pages to get into it,but it is a compelling mystery that will pull you in,twist you around and bring you out at the end exhausted and exhilarated at the same time.   I have bought more of Mr. Collins books and plan to read all of his works!  I found the \\"female\\" issues tough to get through,but the story was written in mid 1800's.   Excellent writing,excellent story.A very good read to hunker down with!
B0006A9FKA|5.0|A brilliant Zombie film and a even better comedy. So this makes it hte best zombie comedy ever with a small bit of romance added to it for good measure.<br />It's a very funny film and is a must have and is one of the top comedy films around. The film works in so many way's the acters work off each other well, the script is brilliant in a stange way (like most zombie and comedy films) and the it's also the little bit's that you catch out of the corner off your eye or 2nd time around that make this a brilliant film and a must have.
0091922348|3.0|i had never heard of ottolenghi before but i read the reviews and thought id give it a go. I was so excited to receive this book and i flicked through from back to front. I loved the look and ingredient lists for the baked goods (towards the back), but as i got to the front of the book, my interest started to dwindle. The first part is LOADS of salad, and im not a salad fan. They also use lots of fruit and vegetable combinations and outlandish ingredients ive never heard about-and yes im usually always shopping in deli's and healthfood/alternative food stores. I decided to then read the introduction section. I really enjoyed the first part and i felt that the explainations of how the restaurant got together was sufficient. Then it carried on and on and on! I also felt that throughout the book there was a pretentious undertones.   I have tried a few recipes and those that i did try i felt (like a previous reviewer put quite exact) that tehy seemed to be lacking in something or not enough of something to make it taste right...but again, thats just my opinion on taste.   I've not tried any of the baked goods yet, and they do look amazing.   Please remember its only a fellow foodies opinion! I wouldnt recommend this book but i do like the pictures and the fact that they accompany a snippet of thought with each recipe....
B000W1V5OC|5.0|It is what you want. Nightwish. Good old version, sounding amazingly good live.  I don't see why anyone who loves nightwish would hesitate to get this.
B000002GQL|5.0|This album is timeless. Classic music that will never fade. My favorites are \\"isn't life strange\\" and \\"for my lady\\". The entire cd is great music and classic Moody Blues.
B000000WF0|5.0|This was one of the albums I really wanted for ages and then I bought and I wasn't dissappointed. The album is dominated by four great songs, Bittersweet Symphony, The drug's don't work, Lucky man and Sonnet. But that dosn't mean the other songs are rubbish, because they are not, they are a very good songs and rounds this brilliant album off. A must have.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|Lady and the Tramp is probably most recognized for the song \\"Bella Notte\\" as Lady and the Tramp eat their Italian meal. The funny thing is I always used to hate that scene, but now I realize its significance. Lady and the Tramp as we all know is the story of lady who lives with a refined high class family and the Tramp who is a stray. If you own a dog, I think you would appreciate this movie, I was noticing the Tramp's facial expressions and movements and while yes it's an animated cartoon they were life like. But this movie really is memorable for the great voice talents of Barbara Luddy (voice of lady) and Larry Roberts. (Voice of the Tramp) The score is fantastic, and the song \\"He's a Tramp\\" which is sung by Peggy Lee is memorable as well. My favorite scene from Lady and the Tramp is when we first meet the Tramp, as he's waking up by the train tracks and walks around the town. I love this scene because the background paintings are wonderful, and his boastful pride is amusing.<br /><br />If you own the VHS or the original released DVD, please upgrade. To see Lady and the Tramp in its original format cinemascope is just amazing. You get to see so much more and the detail is wonderful. Also, Lady and the Tramp has been re-mastered, the original images have been cleaned of grain and dirt, and Lady and the Tramp heard on stereo is incredible. This two disc special edition set also includes the full-screen version of the film but I'd recommend watching Lady and the Tramp in its original format, it's a whole new experience. Also, the platinum edition is packed with extras. There is an hour long documentary called \\"Lady's Pedigree\\", I learned so much about how Lady and the Tramp was created and you'll just be fascinated. Another great feature is \\"the Art of the Storyboard\\", it shows you the storyboarding process. Also included is the Lady and the Tramp original storyboard version of the film. If these features haven't satisfied you there also are two deleted scenes, and let me tell you I'm really glad these two scenes are not in the movie. I was also intrigued to know that there were excerpts from \\"Disneyland\\" TV shows, and some old Lady and the Tramp theatrical trailers. Most of the other features are very short, there is a \\"Bella Notte\\" music video and a interesting feature about \\"the Siamese Cat Song\\", it's about how they found a voice for the Siamese cats. Yes, yes, we get the typical games for the kids and activities which I would skip if you are an older viewer, there really isn't anything interesting here, but the kids might find it enjoyable. Oh, and there is a very nice gallery as well.<br /><br />I guess I've said as much as I need to say, so I'll wrap this up with one last thought. You're probably looking at this platinum edition because you're considering buying it, and just let me say you won't be disappointed. Don't hesitate, if you can find this DVD go out and purchase it before it's sold for outlandish prices, you won't regret it.let me tell you I'm really glad these two scenes are not in the movie.

B0000DZ3EN|4.0|So I can't fault the business for not getting my hands on the product when I was supposed to. It was in my mailbox, but i thought it would be coming to my door as deliveries often do when you're in an apartment with a small mailbox. Anyways, Enjoyed the movie, lots of childhood fun to be had.
1593083661|5.0|You can never go wrong with the classics.  My daughter (11) loved this book adn so did I when I was a girl
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I saw the movie the other day and it was great! It was really close to the book, like the two first movies, Twilight and New Moon. It was my favorite one out of the three. I am gonna buy the DVD when it comes out, and I suggest that you do too, or see the movie in the theatres soon!
B002XTBEDI|4.0|It would have been impossible to top \\"Cranford\\" but this second part can take us back to that sleepy hamlet.  Many of the outstanding original cast members that were so wonderful return to reprise their roles in this continuation.<br /><br />There has been a two year gap since part one ended.  I must agree with a previous reviewer who found \\"Return\\" a bit sadder and emptier than the original. I loved the original story so much that a sequel could have never done it justice in my eyes no matter what. Even then it was far better than a dozen other sequels.<br /><br />Enjoy the film!
0307454541|5.0|Who is the girl with the dragon tattoo? Her name is Lisbeth Salander. She resembles Pippi Longstocking; is the best computer hacker in Sweden and looks like an anorexic victim. She comes from a dysfunctional family, hates police and is a loner. Lisbeth is sexually active and has had over fifty partners. She is also a genius of computer technology.<br />  Her best friend is the investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist recently sentenced to a few months in a minimum security prison as the result of a guilty verdict in a libel case against Hans-Erik Wennerstrom. Wennestrom is a criminal business mogul who is corrupt. Blomkvist is contacted by rich Henrik Vanger to look into the disappearance and apparent murder of his niece Harriet Vanger. Harriet disappeared in the summer of 1966 when she was a girl of sixteen living on the family's isolated island home. Blomkvist and Salander team up to solve the mystery and redeem his reputation in journalism.<br />  Larsson who died in 2004 after completing the millennium trilogy of \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\"; \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\"; and \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's nest\\" writes in a literate style. The characters have depth much as do those in an Elizabeth George mystery novel. Some parts of the book are slow going. The novel begins with a long discussion about the financial shenanigans of Swedish industry which may cause some American reaaders to give up on the book. The parts dealing with the magazine edited by Blomkvist are also somewhat tedious.<br />The novel has sex scenes but they are not explicit and are handled in good taste. Once you begin reading you will not be disappointed. This is a fine novel by a Swedish author who left the world all too soon.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|Amidst royal intrigue and positioning for power our young Victoria finds herself queen of England.  From a young woman who could not descend a staircase without someone protectively holding her hand to prevent a possible accident to taking the throne is a mighty leap.<br /><br />Victoria does have a few missteps but one was definitely not her marriage to Albert.  Unlike most royal marriages they actually loved each other strongly and deeply.  Having viewed other movies/mini-series about them I still find their story remarkable.<br /><br />Emily Blunt does an outstanding job as young Victoria as does  Rupert Friend as her loyal, loving husband.<br /><br />Enjoy the film!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I received this product within just 3 business days after ordering.  This is the first Cooler Master Heatsink and fan I have ever used.  This cooling system brought my CPU temp from 34*C to 29*C.  That is the largest difference I have ever recorded from a non-liquid cooling system.  I have an AMD Phenom II X4 955 Black Edition CPU(AM3 Socket)which has not been overclocked yet, but definitely plan too in the future.  I would recommend this product to anyone interested in overclocking or high performance gaming.  One thing to be careful of is the height of the heatsink.  This heatsink barely fit in my Antec 200 v2 case.  The installation was time consuming, but not difficult at all as long as you know how to remove the motherboard from your case.  Definitely worth buying on Amazon because retail value for this product is set at $59.99.

B0031RAOW8|5.0|I cried for the first time in my life (on a movie) while (and after) watching this movie (I am a guy who NEVER cries) and I cried a gallon and could not stop. Anyone who has a heart should watch 'Hachi - A Dog's Tale'. And yes - keep buckets of tissues handy and spare time to recover after the movie. I thought nothing could make me cry - BUT THIS can wrench out tears even from a stone. Its the most powerful emotional saga I have ever seen - an unforgettable and unbelievable account of eternal love and loyalty. It hit me - pierced my heart and my soul. I always hated tear jerkers because I am not fond of overtly sentimental movies that make one's heart heavy. That was before I knew that a movie could be THIS touching and POWERFUL - I was feeling really heavy after watching this and so just to lighten up a bit I watched one and then two and then three movies back to back (a comedy, an action flick and another drama) but barely a minute after even the third movie was over, the only visions that I had in my mind were of Hachi and I hardly remembered anything from the over six hours of movie watching in between!  This is because Hachi TOUCHES your heart DEEP and not just provides temporary sensory enjoyment - this movie will linger in your mind for ever. Its a true story and the dog is a legend. Suggest you do not research before you see it (resist googling) as it will spoil the effect if you know the story beforehand. Watch it. Its the most powerful and beautiful movie I have ever seen. Blessed is the one who has the fortune to have a dog like Hachi in his lifetime. I love you Hachi and we always will and remember you forever. When I visit Japan I will put a garland around Hachi's statue at Shibuya station, Tokyo to pay my homage - to Hachi - the epitome of divine and endless love, faithfulness and loyalty.
B003CFBQBW|5.0|Unlike the previous two Twilight movie soundtracks, I didn't wait for the movie to come out before I bought the music. I thought that I wouldn't like the music as much - not being able to re-live the movie scenes in my head along with the songs. However, I really enjoyed this CD. The music on this soundtrack has songs that I think are more marketable to the general public, so I didn't need to see the movie first to enjoy the music. I can't say that one Twilight Saga soundtrack is better than the others, but my husband can. He still says that \\"Twilight\\" (movie and soundtrack) are the best so far. No matter if you like the movies or not, the music on this CD is great and totally addicting. It has lived in my CD player in my car since I pre-ordered it back in June. Definitely worth every penny.

0312360266|1.0|Honestly this has to be the worst book ever written. First of all, i feel like it was written by a bunch of 10 year olds, in every paragraph there's a side note in parenthesis that says.\\"and ya totally ugly but OMG i was gonna faint\\" honestly who thinks like that and what kind of author writes like a moron. MY POINT IS THIS BOOK IS STUPID, BORING, AND THERE'S TOO MUCH DESCRIPTION ABOUT SPIRIT AND STUFF THAT HALF THE TIME I DON'T GET. DO NOT BY THIS HORRIBLE BOOK. THE MAIN CHARACTER IS SOOO ANNOYING AND ACTS LIKE A DUMB TEENAGE GIRL AND YOU JUST WANT HER TO SHUT UP.
0385333846|2.0|This book was something that I missed out on when in high school. Now that I have summers off I thought I would go back and read a classic. And so it goes. Well, I will tell you that I was disappointed. I mean how could it be that I just did not see why others have so cherished about this book. I guess it was that its anti-war theme was so pedestrian that it was rather boring. Truly, boring. Maybe he was the first to do this without the over the top deep thinking, but at this point it was plain boring. It is easy to read and understand, but the aliens and flashbacks, ruined it for me. And so it goes. I just did not enjoy this book and felt as though I was cheated. The aliens were just too much. Oh well, this is the price I pay for being a scientist.
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|The 2008 monster movie, \\"Cloverfield\\" stars Michael Stahl-David, T.J. Miller, Lizzy Caplan and Odette Yustman and is directed by Matt Reeves. The film is centered on a major monster attack in New York City that effect a group of young adults.    The film starts off with the group of young adults attending a going away party for their friend, Rob(Michael Stahl-David). At the party, Rob's friend Hud(T.J. Miller) is videotaping everyone's farewells to Rob. The movie, is told from Hud's video camera the entire time. During the party, things start to get out of hand when a huge monster strikes the city and chaos begins.    This movie was a disappointment for me. I for one, am not really into scary or horror type films, even though this didn't exactly fill that genre. I guess it'd be cateogorized more as a thriller, but even so I was disappointed. The ending was in my opinion, horrible. There was a huge buildup to nothing. A lot of characters came and went quite quickly that it was hard to care for them.     I did enjoy that it actually looked like it was filmed by this character Hud the entire time. I really really liked that aspect of it, because it made it more real and more exciting to the story.  It felt like everything that was happening in the city and with these characters was real and genuine. But like I said before, it was hard to really care for these characters because some of them weren't in it for that long so I wasn't exactly sad to see them go.    The story was unique, it starts off as some sort of romantic drama with Rob leaving for Japan and also leaving the love of his life, Beth(Odette Yustman). They are best friends who love each other but of course neither of them know it, and on the camcorder there are videos of Beth and Rob having sweet conversations and having a really great time together but then disaster strikes and the audience is reminded that they are watching a monster flick. So, I really enjoyed seeing snippets of happier times through thecamera and trying to understand their relationship.     I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys monster movies and anyone who can view 85 minutes of film on a shaky hand held camera. It was decent, but I definitely wouldn't watch it again.

B0036EH3U2|5.0|I have the \\"newer\\" box set (you know, the one in the picture), and as others have pointed out the packaging is no longer a concern.  So now that that's out of the way, how does the set actually hold up?  Very well actually, and at times admirably.    BSG was never a bright and shiny show.  Visually speaking it's cinematography was every bit as dark as many of the themes the show explored.  This works to great effect in keeping with the tone of the narrative itself.  The only problem, if you consider it such, is that this style of photography doesn't necessarily lend itself to high defnition video.  Don't get the wrong idea, BSG looks gorgeous on Blu, and at this point I refuse to watch it on any other format.  Just keep in mind that the artistic goals of the shows creators was not to present the most clear and crisp visual presentation available, and you'll be happy.    What these vagaries mean in real world terms is that video quality will range from jaw droppingly-crisp to painfully muddled.  This variance is visible from season to season, episode to episode, and even from scene to scene in any given episode.  Is this a bad thing?  Hardly.  I've watched all of the broadcast episodes, most in HD, and all of the dvds(by the way the season one dvds look phenomenal), and there is a noticeable up tick in clarity on every single episode.  In short this is the best version of BSG that you will ever see, it looks the way it is intended to look ... period.      If you're familiar with Universal's \\"U-control\\" interface, then you know what you're getting with this set.  I'm not a big fan of U-control, but the layout of the menus is very clean, easy to navigate and understand, and minimalist.  If you pause a disc a Universal screen saver will appear on screen, which is actually a nice touch, although as is the case with all java-enabled blu ray discs stopping playback means you will have to search for your resume point (java people get on this already, very annoying).    Thisset includes all of the same bonus features as the DVD box sets.  That said, some of the commentaries leave something to be desired.  I was never a fan of the podcast commentaries while the show was on the air.  I've always felt that they lacked, some more than others, the kind of in depth analysis that commentaries recorded after the on-air run of a show possess.  Still, there is more good here than bad, but it would've been nice to see some new commentaries recorded specifically for the full series set.  Who knows, with BD-live functionality maybe someone will finally put it to good use and we'll see some new commentary tracks down the road.     All in all this set is going to be tough to beat.  It has every single episode accurately presented in HD, many special features that will occupy days (weeks?) of your life if you so choose, and it all comes in a sensible easy-to-store box that doesn't look garish and won't damage your discs.  I waited for a long time to pick up this box set, and I'm even more pleased with it than I anticipated.  This is a must buy.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|\\"500 Days of Summer\\" is not a romantic comedy. It's actually not really a love story at all, in my opinion. The film starts off with Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Tom Hansen, who was just dumped by the girl of his dreams and is breaking plates in his kitchen apartment. His two best friends can't get through to him, so they contact his younger sister to come and talk to him. She gets there and helps him stop breaking plates and then asks him to start from the beginning and tell her what happened between him and the girl of his dreams.     Tom is a guy who apparently believes wholeheartedly about love, destiny, fate and soul mates. He grew up thinking that there is one person for everyone and never found that person until Summer(Zooey Deschanel) came into his life. Summer thinks the complete opposite about love. She doesn't believe in it, any of it. Not of fate, destiny, or soul mates either. She is a child of divorce and from a young age knew that relationships were hard and complicated. So she lives her life never getting too attached to anyone, until Tom.     Tom and Summer meet at work, where they write greeting cards, and Tom falls hopelessly in love. Whereas Summer, not so much. They hang out and go out on dates and they become somewhat of a couple. For Tom, it's perfect at first, Summer throughout some of the scenes seems bored and uninterested. They have a really sweet relationship and both actors have great chemistry.    Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character is sweet, charming, and naive. He is just so adorable you want everything to go his way. He's goofy and a downright nice guy. He is supposed to be this average Joe but I think he's better than average, and he also portrays a character that is completely unrealistic because there are not any guys out there like him. If there is, I never met one. Zoey Deschanel's character is simple, but for some reason in the movie they make her out to be this fantasy type girl, which yes she's gorgeous and sweet but I don't think she's everyone's ideal girl. She plays an independent, free spirited woman who doesn't like complicating things and doesn't like putting labels on her relationships. She just lives life and doesn't show any type of emotion whatsoever. She comes off rather blah. Which, again why would anyone want to date someone like that? Sure she's fun at points but mostly she just seems bored.    Tom's sister, Rachel(Chloe Moretz) is easily one of my favorite characters in the film. She's ballsy and funny and she is the only one that can get through to Tom, which I really enjoy watching that kind of brother-sister relationship. His two best friends are funny too, McKenzie(Geoffrey Arend) and Paul(Matthew Gray Gubler). I wish they could've dwelled a little bit more on their friendship because their scenes were amusing and their friendship felt sincere, they weren't jerks and they didn't make fun of Tom or humiliate Tom which some movies usually like to do.     The actual movie was shot beautifully. The director, Marc Webb, had some great shots. One scene that I really love is Tom going to a party and on the left side of the screen it's showing his expectations on what he wants to happen and on the right side of the screen it's showing the reality of what's actually happening. I love that scene so much, because it's so true, I know I always have expectations of certain things that happen in my life and of course they don't always reach my expectations or they are just different from my expectations all together and I thought that was just very clever. Another shot that I love is this one musical scene which exaggerates the feeling of \\"love\\" or well love being portrayed in movies which is truly fun to watch. There is also another nice part in the film where McKenzie gets interviewed in black and white, along with Paul and Tom all individually about love. It's a nice step outside this somewhat colorful movie and into this deep little segment of black and white reality almost.    All inall, I think this is a really sweet movie. Like I said in the beginning, its not about a love story. I really think it's more a story of a guy who is just trying to find his way, or himself. Which to me, is not only intriguing but also self motivating to watch.    I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys watching something completely different than anything they have ever seen before. Something that will make them feel all kinds of different emotions throughout the film. Its fun, has a lot of heart and is quite deep for a movie with a title that sounds like a really nice, long vacation.      Want more reviews and the latest movie news? Check out [...]
B000H6SXMY|5.0|This is the best series I've ever watched. I can watch each episode over and over and can still collapse with laughter
B001OQCV6A|5.0|\\"Sherlock Holmes\\" directed by Guy Ritchie is set in the 1890s in England starring Robert Downey Jr. in the title role. The detective crime action thriller has Holmes and Watson, portrayed by Jude Law, doing what they do best, solving mysteries and crime.     Guy Ritchie's vision for this film is beyond brilliant. The feeling and tone he set for this film is flawless. He created this almost grungy look to the screen which encapsulates what the time period and lifestyle for Holmes and Watson would have looked and felt like.    Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Holmes is witty, comical and in some scenes quite heroic. His performance was remarkable but the only thing that bothered me about it was the fact that at some points throughout the film it was difficult to understand exactly what he is saying because he speaks very fast and very low. It's a nice character choice but I would've liked to have been able to hear it the first time and not have to rewind it back a couple of times to hear it and understand it. Other than that minor detail he was great and made Sherlock Holmes extremely admirable.    Jude Law's portrayal of Dr. Watson was impressive as well. He was of course brilliant, and comical but obviously not as fascinating as Holmes but that's the character's fault not Law's fault. He is very likable on screen and he too admirable for his wits and fighting skills. I think the friendship between Holmes and Watson is very unique. They play off each other very well and it's a lot of fun to watch. In today's day and age they would be considered major nerds, just sitting around thinking about solving crime and murders from being brainiacs. But in this film it's very inspiring and definitely mind blowing with the way they uncover how certain events and actions occurred.    There is also a love interest throughout the film, Irene Adler, who is portrayed by the gorgeous Rachel McAdams. Irene Adler is a thief who apparently outsmarted Holmes twice in the past, and who heis also in love with. McAdams gives a fine performance as well. She too is witty and pretty feisty for a woman portrayed in that time period. Her chemistry with Holmes is truly fun to watch because they are obviously great together.    All in all I think this movie is entertainment for just about any audience member. It's not only shot beautifully, but it also has comedy, action and even love throughout the film. A movie everyone can watch and love!       Want more reviews and up to date movie news? Check out [...]

B001ECQ75A|5.0|Dreamworks Animation's \\"Kung Fu Panda\\" will most likely be claimed as one of their classics. If not, then it should be. This film which stars Jack Black as Po (the panda) centers on a big fat Panda with hopes of being a master in Kung Fu, yes a panda and yes kung fu, you can't make this stuff up. He dreams of working with Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman)and the furious five -Tigress(Angelina Jolie), Viper(Lucy Lu), Monkey(Jackie Chan), Mantis(Seth Rogen), and Crane (David Cross). When Master Oogway(Randall Duk Kim) -a very spiritual and wise turtle- declares Po as the Dragon Warrior, Shifu and the furious five grow beyond angry that they not only have to train Po in Kung Fu but train him to defeat the legendary Tai Ling(Iam McShane)- the greatest, most powerful tiger there is. Can Po rise up and defeat Tai Ling or will Po, his family and the rest of the town suffer from the loss and destruction that Tai Ling will cause?     \\"Kung Fu Panda\\" is definitely up there with one of my favorite animated movies. It's clever, unique, and funny. Jack Black is a delight, the audience just wants to root for him from the first second he appears on screen. He's fun and goofy and it's great to see his personality shine through an animated panda bear with just his voice. Dustin Hoffman and the furious five are all individually great in their animal fighting roles.     The story line is very original and packed with really great laughs. I love how they slow down certain kung fu parts to make it more dramatic but it winds up just being funny. I also love that Po's dad is a bird that makes noodles.     In my opinion I think this movie is awesome. It is wonderful for both children and adults. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys animated fun comedies, movies with a lot of heart and a wonderful message to send to children of all ages.     If you saw \\"Kung Fu Panda\\" please share your opinion! Just don't give away too much, we don't want to ruin it for anyone! Also, I hear they are making a sequel how do you feel about that??

B002GZQYMK|5.0|Muse has made yet another really interesting album. Nice, strong melodies, good rhythms, the kind of sound that makes your hair stand up, and fairly creepy lyrics that sound like they're derived from George Orwell's \\"1984\\". If you can't buy this, at least borrow it from a friend. It's totally worth it.
B003AYPMBU|5.0|I give this cd 5 stars, in spite of the fact that there are definitely reasons to be disappointed. As others have pointed out, there is nothing new on the cd. It is the same remastered cd that was released several years ago, with the same bonus tracks. I also agree... it would have been nice to see some additional bonus material, especially for those of us who already bought the remastered cd when it first came out.    On the other hand... I have always been a HUGE fan of the song \\"STEELER.\\" It rocks on the original album version, and anyone who knows the song, knows that the last 2 minutes are basically a blistering guitar solo. It sounds dated on the cd, of course (and Dave Holland's mediocre drumming doesn't help), but i have ALWAYS thought it could be updated and be a great cover for some band... or better yet, by Priest, with Scott Travis and double-bass drums!    Until the 30th anniversary concert, i never thought it would happen. But this song alone is worth the price of purchase. Listen to the live version in Dolby digital surround... loud enough to piss off the neighbors, and with a good subwoofer. You'll see why it's worth the price, and why it should be a song that is MUCH more appreciated than it ever was. An underappreciated song, but a true Priest classic.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|My spouse loved the show so much he bought the DVD pack.  I wasn't interested and didn't give it a chance.  Many years later, when I was restless and couldn't find anything appealing on air, I dusted off the cover, watched the first few episodes and became a convert.  There is substance - nuggets of truth-- in the stories, yet it's funny and very entertaining.  It's still relevant today, even with - what - about 6 years or so now since the show was canceled.  Wishful thinking, but I hope the series continues.  There is so much left unexplored.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|This is a great book, I won't get into the writing as that's been covered a lot by others. What needs to be emphasized is that the Kindle version of this book is riddled with typos. I imagine it was scanned in but not checked for errors. Too many words are mangled; being correctly spelled words but they are now words that make sense in context. For instance, \\"sells words\\" as opposed to \\"sell swords.\\" You can easily figure out what the proper words are but it's very distracting and a disappointment for the Kindle service.<br /><br />Get the real book, not the digital version.
0307266303|5.0|This book has been so entertaining and I'm not even a runner, but I love the tone of the book and the way Christopher McDougall relates the stories. I've learned a lot about the elite runners and how crazy they can be to get \\"their fix\\" of running just for the pure joy of it and also how they run even when they're injured or not feeling up to it. More power to them and I love the products that this book introduces too.  I would suggest it to anyone who wants to be inspired!

0316113506|5.0|I bought this book for my dad for Christmas a couple years ago, to encourage his New Year's resolutions regarding exercising more. But after the unwrapping I picked it up myself and was hooked.<br /><br />I have always felt intuitively that the main thesis of this book is true, and lived by it, but I never had any real evidence for that belief and never thought of looking into it myself. It just seemed self-evident that exercise was a necessary and profitable thing to be doing, even as friends during exam-time would ask how I could possibly waste an hour at the gym with finals the next morning.<br /><br />Well, the evidence is in (and has been for some time, it seems) and Ratey does a very admirable job of collecting much of it in one place, and explaining it all in way simple enough for absolutely anyone to understand. Yes, he oversimplifies greatly (brain-derived neurotrophic factor becomes 'Miracle-Gro for your brain'), but then that's the idea, to get this message out and increase people's awareness of just how beneficial exercise is for the brain/mind.<br /><br />This message is examined from almost every conceivable angle, again, all in a very easily-comprehensible way. As I studied neuroscience in undergrad, I was astounded that none of this revolutionary information was being taught. Whether you look at grades, motivation, depression scores, etc. on the behavioral level, or go down to the neural and genetic level in mice, looking at dendrites, BDNF, and so on, every measure suggests that exercise (cardiovascular mostly, but some evidence for strength training as well) has positive effects on mood, memory, motivation, intelligence (IQ) and so on and so forth. The list goes on. Not only are these ameliorative effects observed, but exercise seems to have protective/preventive effects as well with respect to degenerative neural diseases like Alzheimer's or relapses into conditions like depression. This is all ON TOP of the many and obvious benefits for the rest of your body's health and wellbeing! And actually looking at the amount of exercise used in many of the studies, it is a truly pittling amount of time to spend (on the order of a few hours a week, at most) for such wonderful benefits.<br /><br />Furthermore, the book is entertaining and well-written, probably largely thanks to the efforts of the co-author. Ratey himself seems very earnest and to have only the best intentions at heart in getting these ideas out to a nation so wealthy it is creating new diseases of excess for itself (like obesity and Type II diabetes). He's done a great credit to his own mission, and all of us, by marshalling the extensive evidence for his claims in a very readable and well-referenced account.<br /><br />Read this book, and then stick to an exercise routine!

B001MYIXAC|4.0|After hearing a great deal of hype about this movie I finally watched it on Netflix and although it isn't one of the best movies I have ever seen it is definitely worth watching and I do not typically go for violent vampire movies. I do not even watch True Blood.  This movie is very original - the only vampire movie where the vampire is a 12 year old girl.  The two 12 year old actors who star in this movie were great and I see a work in the movies for them in the future.  One of the signs of a good movie for me is if I really care about the characters.  I cared about the two main characters in this movie one of whom is a 12 year old female vampire.  I actually felt sorry for her a bit!  How could you not have sympathy for Eli?
B002KLAL4W|5.0|I love this album. Every song is great. Is it their old stuff, no but that's okay. Pearl Jam have managed to evolve and last over the years which many bands have failed to do. Sure they've lost some of their crowd but at least their around. Their live shows are incredible and worth going to see.

031606792X|4.0|Warning - this review contains spoilers...    I am new to the Twilight Saga.  In about 3 weeks I went from not knowing much about the craze to an addicted and totally engrossed Twilight junkie.  I watched all 3 movies, bought the first 2 on DVD and read all 4 of the books plus Midnight Sun (which I loved and can't wait to be finished).  I was at the point of considering calling in sick at work because I did not want to stop reading my obsession on several occasions...I am constantly searching the Internet for more details wishing for the story to continue. LOL    I thought Breaking Dawn was very good with its perfect ending but it lacked something from the earlier books that I can't quite put my finger on.  I definitely agree with some of the other reviews here that I think the love scene lacked the details that my romantic desire was desperately longing for and the build up of the fight scene was greatly diminished by the Volturi simply backing down.  Although, I am glad that none of my beloved characters were killed, I also expected a lot more action to rectify the situation. I did understand that Aro was taken aback by the fact that Bella was stronger than anyone predicted and was able to protect the entire group from the powers of Jane and Alec with her shield. I also find it unbelievable that Bella adapted so easily to her new life.  The fact that her being so clumsily inept as a human and then perfectly agile and instinctive as a vampire was comical but I was happy for Bella that she finally achieved her goal to be with Edward forever and seemingly with exceptional ease. I loved that Edward was finally able to share Bella's thoughts when she let him see them.  I cheered when he couldn't even contain himself to see everything she was showing him.    There has been some criticism about how Bella was changed and while I agree somewhat with other reviewers, I think that parts of this story were beautiful.  I don't think Edward would have changed Bella if it were not to save her.  That would go against everything that Carlisle stood for - although he would have understood and still loved Edward it would have been disappointing.  Plus, Edward was so adamant about not taking her life and her soul from her that I don't think that he would be that selfish to simply change her just to keep her.  That was part of the main point of his character - the sacrifice he was making, fighting against his vampire nature, to love her. The part I thought was truly beautiful is the loving way that he \\"mended\\" her during the change with caressing kisses filled with venom and actually speeding up the process.  I felt that Edward was doing everything possible to make the transition as easy as possible for Bella.    I felt a sense of loss when I completed the Saga and I am not sure if the feeling stems from the story ending or that I feel let down a little - no unfulfilled.  I want more, much more.  I would like to read an adult version of Breaking Dawn that includes the details of this love story that would be worthy of the beginning of this riveting romance.  Until then, I am starting back from the beginning again with Twilight and intend to read through to the very last page of Breaking Dawn again as I cannot leave it behind yet.  I love this love story.
B000KKPN5C|3.0|This flash works best for the casual shooter,  who uses flash sparingly between long intervals. It will work very well for a little outdoor fill flash and indoor portraits; but anyone looking to accomplish some serious continuous photography should look elsewhere.  The SB 400 has very limited range and goes thru batteries very quickly. I have experienced better performance from the D40's  built in flash.    Also be advised that it will not work with your film based Nikons or the D1, D1x, D1H, D100 and D70.    It is very small and light weight, but so is the performance.
B0010HOZS0|3.0|I hope they keep making these bodysnatcher invasion flicks.  It's closer to reality than network news programming.  The theme, similar to [[ASIN:B00008HCAB Rhinoceros]] (based upon the play by Eugene Ionesco), is universal.  You could include [[ASIN:B0000714AG Invaders from Mars (Special Edition)]] (the original 50s cult classic---not the 80s remake, [[ASIN:B00005K3OA Invaders from Mars]], which was pathetic), or [[ASIN:B0002CHK1S The Thing (Collector's Edition)]] (as opposed to [[ASIN:B00009NHC0 The Thing from Another World]] since, although it is another great one from the 50s, it didn't involve creepy humanoid duplication---as in \\"Are you/he/she one?\\"---so much as the threat of alien proliferation/infestation in general), in the genre (I'm probably leaving some out).  It's real.  It's happening, baby.  Don't go to sleep.  You'll wake up---one of them.  Everything you feared and hated before...  They're everywhere.  They're taking over.  One side wants to help people, or so they make themselves appear.  The other is definitely about greed, punishment and war.  The idea, of course, upon which these movies are based is a simple one:  Anybody who is diametrically opposed to your core beliefs (and some even have core beliefs that aren't prefabricated) is a cold blooded, unflinching, and evil robot.  An other.  A thing.  An alien.  This is the principle behind political diatribe, ethnic cleansing, or the employment process of any corporation or government agency.  Tell me this isn't so.  Then vote for the monster of your choice.  Sure, you're making a difference...<br /><br />This last offering, [[ASIN:B00005JPUN The Invasion]], wasn't too bad until it got to the end, and did what I was afraid they would do with it---the simplistic, soothing ending.  The cop out.  For that they get a well deserved thumbs down.  Sorry if I spoiled it for you.  Or maybe I just reassured you...<br /><br />Except for maybe the second one of these bodysnatcher flicks, that cool 70s version[[ASIN:B000QQJ3Q0 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (Collector's Edition)]] (they got it right), they keep screwing up the endings.  Maybe it depends on what regime is in power at the time of release (I think I see a pattern here).  Take the first one [[ASIN:0782009980 Invasion of the Body Snatchers]], for example (much as I love it)---I would have had the movie end with the lunatic raving and beating on cars, trying to tell people \\"They're here already!  You're next!\\" or whatever.  Hilarious.  You'd just know that he would eventually be picked up by the boys in blue and/or the ones in white with the butterfly nets, etc.  Urgent need for therapy.  The End.<br /><br />As has previously been noted, the movie has action scenes and pyrotechnics, alrighty.  But they are visually interesting, unique, well done, not the usual.  And, yes, the infected spread the alien virus by barfing.  Why not spitting, I wonder (remember the initial AIDS scare?  Cop shoots man for spitting on him, afraid he was trying to spread AIDS).  Hell, they could sneeze.  There are also door knobs, shopping carts, or even toilet seats, for transmission of the deadly alien virus.  But no, as usual, Hollywood goes for the unsubtle, and the gross.  Which is how they view their audience.<br /><br />The premise of an outer space virus as the culprit is an intriguing one, and was worth pursuing.  It also saved money on special effects for pods, duplicate bodies, and the like.  However, if you're going to introduce the antagonist as a cosmic flu, you should explain how and why a lowly virus would be trying to take over the world.  An engineered virus, launched by an advanced alien race intent on subjugation of the native populace, is a concept I would have found more credible (but that's not Hollywood---that is to say, simplistic---enough).  They wouldn't want to destroy us because they need us, like any great cult leaders worth their salt, as mindless menials and thralls to build and work in whatever incomprehensible instrumentalities they design as they slowly turn our beloved planet into a hellworld.  That's a movie I could get behind, so long as they leave out the sugar frosted ending and the melodramatics.  Science-fiction and fantasy author Jack Vance used a not dissimilar theme---case in point, of competing alien cultures introducing biological agents to subvert a planet they both wanted, battling each other by accelerating evolution and promoting competitive and antagonistic lifeforms---in a short story he wrote circa 1951 called \\"The World Between\\" [[ASIN:B0007EH8G8 The World Between and Other Stories]].  Unfortunately, the film industry does not, as a rule, use science-fiction writers to produce science-fiction movies.  Which is a shame, because what you end up with, time and again, is an imbecilic shell of a story with overblown CGI, 2-dimensional characters, overacting, brain-dead dialogue, and lots of explosions.<br /><br />I'd like to make one of these movies.  Anybody in Lalaland listening?  Give me a shot.  I wouldn't be so pc about it.  I don't think you have to reinforce an audience's preconceptions, and ignorance, with a happy-face ending.  Anybody remember Alfred Hitchcock?  Even if they didn't get it at the box office, at least it might become a cult film.  I would embed it in reality, not some fairytale with the cavalry swooping in to the rescue in the final scene, everything's alright, you can go back to sleep now (stupid, they told you not to sleep, didn't they?).  What a con.  The \\"good guys\\" are infected too, get it?  No?<br /><br />But don't get me wrong.  This movie is definitely worth the 3 bucks I paid for it in the local cut-out rack.  I would hesitate to pay 5.  But then, I've only seen it the one time.  It was ok until that all-too-predictable touchy feely end.  Gotta reassure the proles.  If you depress them too much, it might affect their productivity.  Don't worry, we'll protect you.  OK we scared you, that's our job, but now we're going to bring you back to the warm, fuzzy reality of tidy soundbytes, simple solutions, happy endings, big screen teevees, and job security.  You're not really controlled by aliens who are exploiting you to the grave, wringing all your precious life force out of you before tossing you into the scrap heap when you're depleted, like a drained battery, for their own devious purposes.  That's just make believe.  You've been entertained.  Now it's time for bed (sure, you can sleep---it was only a movie).  Don't forget to set your alarm.  Have a good night's rest, take a tablet.  Then drink your coffee and make sure you're not late.  Busy day ahead.<br /><br />A message is being insinuated as the celluloid winds along, a point made several times during the course of the story line:  Conflict, greed, war, rape and slaughter are bad---but at least they're human.  It equates a world with no conflict and destruction as somehow not human---even sinister and alien.  We humans are just a bunch of cut-ups, aren't we?  The implied subtext is that a world of conflict, tho' bad, is AOK so long as you occupy the high ground with the biggest club.<br /><br />What's wrong with someone taking the opposite view, even if equally unsubstantiated, in some later cinematic reincarnation of the alien bodysnatcher theme---that war, destruction, and misery are sinister and alien induced?  And that peace, trade, and prosperity is our natural state.  Oh, heavens no!  That might hit a little too close to home.  This is entertainment, not revolution.<br /><br />OK, I'm well aware that human beings are quite capable of very bad actions on their own, without any outside help.  I'm not so daft as to believe that this world would automatically be a paradise, if only those evil aliens would just leave us alone.  But there is a question of how much of this bad behavior is genetically predetermined, and how much born of social inequity and injustice, instigated, or at least countenanced, by a sacrosanct, generation-spanning rule of law rigidly and brutally enforced.  Just a thought for some budding young film maker out there whose family was wealthy enough to send him/her to film school...<br /><br />By far, the best part of this movie is the graphics with soundtrack during the first part of the end credits.  That other stuff was just a warm up.  But then they quashed that with a blank screen for the remainder.  Maybe they ran out of CGI money.  Perhaps they didn't want to disturb you too much.<br /><br />Maybe someday someone will make a version which would reflect reality just a little too much.  Then maybe you'd read or see/hear about how his/her promising career was unexpectedly cut short by a plane crash, car wreck, freak accident, etc.  But no, it probably wouldn't happen that way.  With all we've gone through in just the past 20 or so odd years, we probably wouldn't even notice.<br /><br /> © 2010 RAPWreckerds
B000002VMD|5.0|I recently purchased the original soundtrack and am completely satisfied with the excellent quality of the CD. I love to buy products from Amazon because I'm never disappointed in the price of the product or the quality of the service. I use the standard shipping, but the product usually arrives much sooner than expected.
030745455X|5.0|There is more.  This is a summer read that sets you up for the next novel, but doesn't leave you disappointed. I could not put it down and was torn between sharing these books or keeping them in my library. The visualizations of the characters and setting are enough to shake your soul, but the true power of this novel is in the plot.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I loved everything about this pad vs my old N52 that finally died.  This one contains a great display that you can customize, a quick 4-profile switch via buttons and more keys to program.    The ONLY thing I dislike about this pad is programming the directional joypad.  Telling it to turn left only makes it jolt left instead of doing a full turn.  I've read the docs multiple times, and checked Google with no luck.  You can either code the joypad to jolt in directions, or get stuck turning forever when trying to re-program.  I don't see a way to make it smoothly turn like it does with factory defaults.
030726999X|5.0|it can't be over...but it is...sadly so.  These novels were recommended to me for an absorbing adult read and they lived up to all the hype. Lisbeth Salander has been growing as a character... now just in my imagination, but isn't that what books are supposed to do? Read all three of Stieg Larson's creations, in order, and mourn the loss of a talented mystery author.

0061998494|5.0|This book was amazing!  Tells the story of a man who has always been in love with America and finds his way there and becomes a great success, but with many trials and tribulations that will make you laugh so hard you hurt.
B003EYVXY6|5.0|I agree with the other reviewers in giving this movie five stars. It's a beautiful, thought-provoking and exciting film. But it doesn't need any sort of conspiracy to get a narrow distribution in the USA. It's just not a particularly commercial film, and that's a good thing! If one is going to suggest conspiracies, you could just as easily say there was some sort of \\"Jewish conspiracy\\" against the movie, as the film deplores bigotry of any kind, not just Christian fundamentalism.    You come away from the film with a great admiration for the heroine, and compassion for all people who try to forge a path of reason in a world of mindless hatred. \\"Agora\\" is well worth checking out. It's one of my two favorite films so far this year. The other is \\"How to Train Your Dragon\\" so I'm not an elitist!
B000PC8AFU|3.0|When an album is created featuring the work of many artists, even with a genius like Stevie Ray Vaughan to tie them all together, it can be overwhelming.  There are approaches to blues on this CD, all fine, and probably wonderful on their own.  Put together, on one CD, it is hit and miss.  While Pipeline, featuring SRV and Dick Dale, is an instant classic and on my IPod's Top 25, Miami Strut, with AC Reed and Na-Na-Ne-Na-Nay with Bill Carter, could have been left off the compilation.  Plus, Let's Dance, David Bowie?  I realize the CD Let's Dance,kick started SRV's career, but Cat People would have been a better choice, with the rugged riffing guitar work.  Not to poo-poo all over this CD, there are other good songs.  Albert's Shuffle, with Albert Collins smokes.  Four songs featuring women lead singers are good, and lend interesting, \\"new\\" wrinkles to SRV's work.  Those songs are You Can Have My Husband, with Lou Ann Barton, On the Run with Katie Webster, Soulful Dress by Marcia Ball and Texas Flood, with Bonnie Raitt.  The first mentioned may be the best of the four, filled with wry Blues humor.  Texas Flood, however, is also very good, a cool blues with some serious guitar work.  For a SRV completist, don't bother listening to me, just pick it up.  For someone who likes SRV and wants to get something a little more off the beaten path, perhaps a bit meaty, get the SRV Box.  It is a little more SRV as leader, with touches of special guests and early bands.  While this may be seen as a record company money grab, with a little under half of this CD being previously released, this CD, at a reasonable price, is worth it for Pipeline alone.  Add the aforementioned Albert's Shuffle, and Texas Flood, and it's worth the three stars, maybe half a star more.
0545123283|4.0|This book is the second great installment in The Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy.  Usually I don't like sequels as much as the first book, but with Linger, I did.  It kept me hooked from the beginning and I read most of it in one sitting!<br /><br />This story incorporated 4 points of view and I liked how it alternated.  I once again really liked Grace and Sam.  I thought they were such a cute couple.  And I actually started to like Isabel.  She seemed to actually have a heart and a soft side.  Cole wasn't my favorite, but I don't think he was supposed to be, although he did grow on me a little at the very end.<br /><br />I must say that I didn't see the exact end coming.  I mean, I knew what would happen in the big picture, just not the reasoning for it.  And Sam's choice at the end shocked me...I thought he would go the other way.  This book really leaves off on a cliffhanger.  I want to know more and I don't want to have to wait for the third book to come out!
B003LAH7MU|4.0|There's nothing more absurd than acting as if music which was largely successful because of its innovation, its creativity, its sense of play and wonder, somehow fails when it's played in a different context and with different instrumentation than the original. I was fortunate enough to see the Symphonicities concert at the Met last week, and having heard the music both live and now on this CD, I can confirm Rob's comments here: these aren't more boring rock rehashes, the LSO sawing through another painfully staid rendition of some Rolling Stones hit (which says much more about about the lack of breadth in a typical Rolling Stones song than about any failing in the LSO). Rather, these are (for the most part) strikingly unusual, challenging arrangements which push the boundaries of the songs to which they pay tribute. In some cases this enhances the song's original effect: the arrangement of \\"Englishman in New York,\\" for instance, which broadens the impact of the song's light-hearted, dancing playfulness, or \\"When We Dance,\\" which lets Sting's voice soar, as only it can, over the lush accompaniment which I always imagined listening to the original version. In other instances it redirects the song in striking ways--like in \\"Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic,\\" where the joy of the original, strengthened by the strings, is now underlined with the wonder of newly discovered love by brilliant use of brass, the trumpet line drawing the vocals along with it. And some tracks not on the CD--like the astonishingly re-envisioned \\"King of Pain,\\" which takes a iconic piece and fortifies its brooding sound with a dark, driving energy which I certainly never heard in the original, or the weighty, forceful take on \\"Russians\\"--are revelations. Not everything works perfectly here--I wasn't a big fan of \\"She's Too Good For Me\\" to begin with, and this arrangement seems to be trying to force-feed energy into the song--but this is a relatively minor misstep on an album which doesn't have many.<br /><br />The mark of a great song, indeed any great work of art, is its ability to stand not only on its own, but to be responded to, expanded upon, challenged, redefined, and made new by those who come afterwards. And the mark of a great revision is its ability to both enlighten the old and open vistas into the new. There's a reason that Hendrix was so drawn to Dylan's \\"All Along the Watchtower,\\" and a reason why Dylan never saw the song the same way after hearing Hendrix's version of it. I'd argue that Brian's missed the boat a bit here (albeit thoughtfully and without the smug, vague dismissiveness of some other critics); this is a lot more than old wine in new bottles. It's top flight work from a great songwriter and a masterful arranger. It's well done from both, and well worth your time.ve many.

B0039ZF8D2|5.0|The best collobrative album ever between two artists from different genres of music. As an African it hits home. The production is strong and the lyrics are on another level. Nas pushes himself higher on the all-time list of MCs and Damian Marley proves he is one of the best of his era.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|I have not put this knife on real test yet but it seems to be extremely durable and can take a lot of beating. For instance, I was using a hammer on it to break off small chunks from a big piece of rock solid ice. However, it is quite heavy in my backpack for hiking. Similar to some other reviewers, I found the knife is not sharp enough out of the box. For example, I was on a fishing trip and couldn't even have a clean cut to chop the worm in half. As a solution, I bought the AccuSharp tool to sharpen the knife (and I highly recommend this sharpening tool). Overall, I am happy with this knife and will definitely bring it along for all my outdoor trips. This is the knife that allows you to do all the thing that Bear Grylls performed.
B001UC09ZS|3.0|Interesting.
0446563048|5.0|This book was extremely inspirational.  It gives you the insight into a true entrepreneurs mind set.  Make it, risk it all and make it again.  Once I started reading this I could not put it down.
B000002G6J|5.0|looked for this 'album' which I had as a vinyl record and found it for cheap on Amazon.  The company sent it quickly too.  A good experience.
B002SEQ8ZC|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie when I saw it for the first time on TV.  I decided to go out and purchase it and bought this blu-ray set.  I love all of the extra features that comes with it and the 3D glasses as well.  They're only cardboard glasses but they can still work if you choose to wear them.  I personally have only worn them for a few minutes and they seemed to be decent, but I prefer to watch the movie without.    The movie itself is beautifully animated with lovable characters and a great storyline.  Dakota Fanning was the perfect actress to voice Coraline and she did a great job.    However, I would recommend that parents with small children don't show this to them without viewing it themselves first.  The Nightmare Before Christmas had spooky characters but it was still an enjoyable film for youngsters.  Coraline is a little different because this actually could scare children with the spooky magic and imagery that happens later in the film.  When I first watched this movie it had an eerie feel to it (and I'm 21 years old).  That's when I thought to myself, \\"This movie isn't for kids.\\"  With all of that said, this movie had quickly grown to become my favorite animated feature.  Although it's creepy it is still enjoyable and I could watch it over and over again.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|Yes I did, that is, after weighing up the decidedly contradictory reviews and the fact that I'm not that much of a Scorsese fan (especially of his later films, that is).  I'm also not much on horror.    Perhaps Leonardo with his superior acting range tipped the balance, but whatever changed my initial impulse to avoid the film, I now have to add my voice by stating without any hesitation that this is a truly remarkable experience and a film well deserving of an award. In fact, I consider it one of Scorsese's very best.    However, I am inclined to agree with one reviewer that Kingsley, Ruffalo and some of the other actors may have been miscast, but it doesn't really matter as the film finally belongs to the director and Mr Di Caprio who continue to astound us with their undeniable ability.  Yogesh
B002ZTIIXK|3.0|Great Cd but unfortunately the Cd will skip  and say error because of scatches on the lasy 2 songs  which one happens to be my favorite

B000001F9E|5.0|\\"The Boys Are Back In Town\\" - what else do you need to say?<br /><br />You know the song. Your parents know the song. Heck, even your grandparents know (and like) the song. It was one of THE songs of '76, and ever since then it has been played on the radio at least once a week, every week. You'll hear it played /everywhere/.<br /><br />And it's a damn good song, a solid rocker. Plenty of air guitar material here, and everybody knows the lyrics. It's been featured everywhere, from ads to movies - the [[ASIN:B0030IIZ4M Toy Story]] franchise uses it as a theme song, and Bon Jovi covered it in the movie [[ASIN:B0000542CK Navy Seals]].<br /><br />But that's not all the album has to offer, not by a long shot. \\"Jailbreak\\" starts things off, classic Thin Lizzy sound. \\"Warriors\\" and \\"Emerald\\" are also great rockers, while \\"Running Back\\" is one of those mellow songs that even rockers like.<br /><br />And then there's \\"Cowboy Song\\", with it's blazing lead break which will rip your lungs out.<br /><br />This is one of /the/ rock albums of all time, and is consistently at the top of the best seller lists, for good reason. If you don't have this in your collection, then you're probably a little weird.
B0015DROBO|1.0|Everyone can't be so enthralled with this book, and be wrong, right? Wrong!  BOMB!  I bought the book curious to see what the hoopla was all about... I really wanted to like  the \\"story.\\" What a colossal waste of my time. I plodded on wanting to chuck the book, but wanting to see the magic everyone seems to see and are making it a best seller--- maybe that's the trick-- get the masses to buy it, and shoot the sales up... but the magic never appeared!<br />Got excited when the Lisabeth character appeared-- ahh, here's the part where the story takes off and we see what the fuss all about.... wrong, again!<br />Absolutely no depth to the characters, none-- where the reader could engage sympathetically or in any other way with either of them because they're skeletal-- zero dimention, no \\"draw\\" to them.  The writing was childishly juvenile, cold, impersonal and bare. (Doubt it was due to translation.) Cannot imagine WHY this writer's trilogy has caught on.  Don't bother to waste your time.  This book is so bad I had to write a review to save you from it.
0061703257|5.0|This book will grab you from the opening chapter and ceases to release even after the cover is closed. As you travel with Teddy through the asylum you soon find there is more than meets the eye. The place holds a multitude of secrets, each terrifying and the twists just keep turning. There is no telling what will happen next yet each event falls perfectly into place leading to the ultimate climax.<br /><br />Shutter Island is well-written, it's beautiful words at odds with the horrific story line yet somehow resulting in balanced tale. This book is impossible to predict and equally as difficult to put down. It will have you reading into the wee hours...just be sure to leave all the lights on. I can only imagine how terrifying the movie must be.
0307474712|2.0|Good premise. Well defined characters. But tedious by the end. Just too much of the same type of scenes. I get it, the protagonist is a drunk and a jerk but I don't need hundreds of pages to make the point. I never had confidence he had truly changed either. Seeing people make the same mistakes over and over with little redeeming value leaves me unsatisfied. They would not have ended well  and Emma's fate felt like a copout  The book  was well written but I would've have enjoyed it more had it been half the length.
B00005JL96|5.0|I keep reading all these parents bashing this movie. They want well behaved kids and good manners in a movie. Not all children are like that! This child has had a rough, very emotional past. Her parents were killed in a car accident. It happens. She is being raised by her sister who is trying to raise Lilo but is young herself and trying to support them. I have known a lot of children back in my school days who acted outlandish like Lilo. She doesn't have any friends because she is different. She is lonely and just wants a friend but doesn't know how to behave. Yes Lilo is a brat (aren't all kids sometimes in their lives?) and yes Nani doesn't handle things well (she is the sister not the mother, me and my sister fought like that) and Stitch is destructive.(that's what he was made to be, but overcomes it) Lilo even states that \\"I know that is why you wreck things and push me, because you miss your parents and cry at night. You must have dreams about them\\" Then she offers him to be part of the family. Both characters feel LOST. Hence the attitude problems!  The point of the story is they all stay together and love each other. A 2-4-7-and 10 year old have all viewed this movie with me. Not one of them destroy stuff or call me \\"stupid head.\\" They laughed at those parts but never repeated them. This movie is rated PG. I understand it is hard to explain to a child why someone is taking a child away from their home, but in the real world it happens. It always can't be rainbows and sunshine. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone under 5. (Because it would be hard to explain somethings to them.)  I find this movie funny and entertaining. This family has gone through a lot but stays together and loves each other. I personally think that is a good message to give to your children ALONG with all the happy, rainbows and sunshine ones.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|Our family has watched this movie at least 20 times and counting.  Any time we want to have fun we pop it in.  We also bought the CD to use when we exercise or clean the house.  It's the only way for us to get through that drudgery!  There really is no better way to lift your mood than to watch a musical. We are very happy with our DVD & CD and will rebuy them the minute they wear out.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Serenity is one of my favorite movies of all time. One of the best parts is the very beginning when you first see the ship and Mal Reynolds makes some snide remarks about the ship falling apart. I actually own two copies of the DVD. One is the original, the other is this collectors edition. Both are basically the same, but the collector's version has a nice box and a few extra features.<br /><br />If you enjoy sci-fi or western films or maybe just mystery/adventure films, buy Serenity, you won't regret it! It is Joss Whedon's masterpiece. Check it out!
B0015519VS|5.0|I didnt understand why \\"Here I Stand\\" didn't do well. I loved all of the songs. This album is one of those rare albums where you don't skip any tracks and just let it play. The only song I skip is \\"Prayer for you\\"  but its just an interlude and its dedicated to his sons. BUT BUY IT!!! YOU WQNT BE DISAPPOINTED. I think people were just hating on his new marriage lifestyle and that made their decision to not be a fan of this album...which is dumb..... OH yeah and \\"lifetime\\" is also one you would skip.
B00006AUIG|1.0|After having read the various reviews I thought that this would be a great, yet spooky, movie to watch with a group of friends. Well, to put it bluntly, it was the most ridiculous thing I think I've ever seen and one of my friends wanted to know who to send the invoice to for wasting two hours of her life!! The creepiest part of the DVD is the cover!!

B001IBIHQ4|2.0|As production values go, this show has everything in abundance. It even puts most motion pictures to shame.     Pitty it didn't have a script that was of the same value.     In fact it failed badly in so many ways that I have no interest in buying the set, regardless of collecting War Movies in general.     Comparison with Band of Brothers is unavoidable and also highlights its failiure. In BoB it is Easy Company that is the true central character of the show. We get to know Easy through its fighting men, but the story has a fixed background that we can associate with and character development is easy to follow. In the end you almost feel as part of the unit. In HBO Pacific no paticular unit is followed and instead we get a summary of the Pacific Campaign seen through various (and certainly variously interesting) characters. This means we do not get to follow the same characters all through except in a disjointed way. So all through the show I never felt becoming a part of anything.     Then the show does something amazing. It seems to try to cater to everyone? We have episdoes which almost have no place in a War drama like Episode 3 where the brave marines spend an entire episode trying to invade Australian Women. Worse the focus becomes entirely devoted to a single rather boring character, melhancoly and depressed. At the time the show uses this paticular characters memoirs as a base but really if Episode 3 hadn't been there it not only would not have been missed but probably would have been a better show, or better if it had been crammed into 10 minutes before getting back into action. But it was Episode 4 that almost killed all interest in the show for me. Having already suffered from watching Episode 3 then Episode 4 started out o.k. with action at Cape Gloucester where the main enemy is the jungle itself. 10 minutes in and I had forgiven Episode 3. But then the script writers flushed a good start down the toilet and we get to follow our melhancoly lover Lechieto a field hospital where he spends the rest of the Episode in a mental ward in his customary depressed way. Imagine watching BoB and the Bastonge Episodes had focused on Buck recovering from an arse wound rather than what happend in Bastonge and you wouldn't be far off. After being subjected to Episodes 3 and 4 the series start to focus on a new character and even if there was more action to follow the series failed to engage me from then on. Episode 8 is called Iwo Jima, except it has almost no Iwo Jima but again is focusing on some love drama. Boy.     High production value and a sad script make this a watcher but hardly a collectable and if you never see it, it is no great loss. Seems the Pacific is a little cursed when it comes to movie making with Pearl Harbor, Windtalkers, Flags of Our Fathers and now the Pacific.
0684833395|2.0|Hard to read, strange book.  Not sure why anyone would like it- it just doesn't seem to be well written, so even with the whole catch 22 point which is pretty clever, it is just bad.
0783107986|5.0|This was a worthwhile purchase at a cost well below expectations.  The subject covered, namely the history of WW-2, was complete, concise, accurate, informative and precise.  I have had opportunities to watch only scattered episodes on television when the program first aired in the seventies, and informally up until recent times. Thanks be to the MILITARY CHANNEL, but having the whole of the story in one piece, in one place, at one time, as it were, provided the missing formerly remembered pieces and forgotten details that made this purchase one to be without regret.  In one word, my opinion, OUTSTANDING!
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Since I first starting watching Daria on MTV, I have always loved this show, and was sooo excited when I got the email about it coming to dvd!     I received this product in the mail nicely and securely wrapped, with my free tshirt nestled right with it. The dvd case is sturdy and thick, so there's less of a chance of me walking over the box and crushing the contents. Upon opening the box, each dvd is snapped in securely, clearly labelled as to what season each contains. I've tested out all of the dvds in the package, and they all play very well.     Of course because I love this show so much, I will obviously recommend to this product to any fan of Daria. The money is well spent, to have the series in its entirety all together, ready to watch.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|I love this cd, its soothing to my ears and nas is a true genius a rap master,a lyricist. Damian marley reggae style was amazing to, but featured members like lil'wayne could have stayed out of this project to me he can not rap as they all say hes the best rapper in the world.... ''No way ho'zay'' some of his lyrics does not make any sense to me, he has nothing to talk about in his songs.
1416550550|5.0|I just finished the book and read it on a Kindle so I did not know how many pages it was-  I loved the book, it had been a while since I have read a book that I did not want to put down.  I loved how it went back and forth between the characters and the time periods, it kept me guessing till the end, and I loved the characters.  What a great summer read
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|This Album is amazing I had never heard of them till I heard \\"Little Lion Man\\" so I checked them out and was surprised. I was not expecting what I heard.I am new to this type of folk-rock but if it sounds like Mumford & Sons count me in. Now I'm just waiting till they come to Orlando to see them live
B002ZG980U|4.0|'Reality is that which when you stop believing in it does not go away.'  Philip K Dick.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan's movies are among my favorite movies of the last ten years.  I remember being incredibly impressed with [[ASIN:B00003CXZ4 Memento]], and own it. [[ASIN:B000BUYP4Q Batman Begins (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], ($373m ww) also starring Cillian Murphy, Michael Caine and Ken Watanabe), inspired me to explore and understand the idea of archetypes and mythology in movies, and presenting characters first as something else. He saved the Batman franchise and took it to a new level with Dark Knight grossing over $1 billion worldwide, and he also made The Prestige, (again with Michael Caine).  I think that after seeing Inception everyone who knows movies will appreciate who Christopher Nolan is, and his brilliance not only as a director, but also as the writer of Inception.<br /><br />Leonardo di Caprio, not just a talented actor, has undoubtedly become one of the most reliable barometers of movie quality with a string of outstanding movies such as The Aviator The Departed, and Shutter Island, the thriller [[ASIN:B001C48EGK Body of Lies]], and Blood Diamond, delivers another outstanding performance. It's also refreshing to see Marion Cotillard who won the Oscar for [[ASIN:B00005JPX8 La Vie en Rose (Extended Version)]]  once again in a movie worthy of her talent.  She brings a certain richness and emotionality to what is mostly a visual spectacle.<br /><br />As you begin to watch, you may notice parallels between Inception and James Bond and The Matrix, although the stacking of realities seems more reminsicent mostly of [[ASIN:B0009G3B0G The Jacket]] or Total Recall, both based on Philip K Dick stories.<br /><br />As the movie opens Cobb washes up on a beach.  The armed rescuers notice a a gun in his belt.  He is taken to the Overlord, an old man. He also has a spinning top.<br /><br />In the Matrix, Neo was a computer hacker. In Inception, Cobb, Leo DiCaprio's character is a mind hacker.<br /><br />In the world of Inception, some people have the technology to invade the unconscious mind of others, and take their ideas.  It is also possible to implant ideas, without people being aware. This is called Inception. You may wonder what being a spy and being a dream hacker have in common.<br /><br />As a hypnotist I can say Inception is a fascinating trance experience, and takes you deeper, and continually shifts scenes. Because of this, you may miss out on some details, and you may in fact, as I did, have to go see the movie again to fill in the blanks.  I understood the levels a lot better the second time.<br /><br />Something to watch out for is trains and Mal's talk of trains, breaking glass repeated, a ring on Cobb's finger that appears and disappears in the second scene, and seems to shift to the overlord, and later Saito's finger.  Not sure what it means.<br /><br />If you have not already seen it, the following may be helpful. The unconscious mind cannot distinguish between what is real and imaginary. That is a conscious distinction. The unconscious mind is the domain of memory, emotion, and imagination. Your unconscious mind repeatedly presents unresolved issues to be resolved, which is one of the main functions of dreaming. You don't always remember a dream after you have had it.<br /><br />There are some allusions to mythology. In Greek mythology, Ariadne constructed a maze. There is a character called Fischer, the son of Fischer, ailing ruler of an empire.  In mythology, we have the story of the Fisher King.<br /><br />I particularly loved the last moments in the movie, and I think you will too.<br /><br />'All reality is an illusion, albeit a persistent one.'  Albert Einstein.<br /><br />If you're like me, I think you will remember Inception long after the final credits roll.  I think a lot of people will have to see it more than once to get it. The best way to describe it I think is that it is a 'tour de force' of the imagination,<br />and raises the bar on creativity.  Aspiring directors will look to this movie, and raise their own standards.  Well, I can dream, can't I?<br /><br />Having said all this,  I know this movie will not appeal to everyone. Some people may be overwhelmed by it, and others just won't get it. I think most people will love it, and it will do very well based on word of mouth.<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful to you.raise their own standards.  Well, I can dream, can't I?

0307473473|3.0|I bought this book because I wanted to see what the fuss was about.  I liked the story, but didn't think it was anything special.  I didn't care enough about this book or the two main characters to buy the other two.  I just kept reading so I would see how it turned out, but I almost stopped.
0545123275|4.0|Shiver is a lighthearted fantasy romance between a werewolf and human. Sound familiar? Elements of the story may have been done before but Shiver manages to take werewolf lore and create a new twist to it. Wolves in Shiver do not change with the phases of the moon or on command but rather they change with varying temperatures and eventually, lose the ability to change at all. Steifvator weaves in her twist to werewolf mythology to create a story that was unique and unusual.     The writing style of Shiver took a little time for me to get used to, I found myself in a love/hate relationship with it. Steifvator tells this story from the varying point of views of Sam (our wolf) and Grace (our \\"human\\")the varying point of views allows the reader to get into the head of each character and really learn about them and see the world through their eyes. This is especially important when dealing with a werewolf whose days as a human are numbered and Grace, who has an unusual obsession with the wolves (or one particular wolf) that inhabits the woods near her house. I had a hard time accepting at first, what draws Grace to this wolf. Grace's fascination is beyond just being curious, she is obviously head over heels for a wolf, not knowing that the wolf is part human. By switching point of views, I was able to get into Grace's head a little bit more and try to understand the attraction but could not truly accept it until Grace learns Sam's secret. Sam's point of view was a little more easy for me to grasp. I had a better idea of his confusion, his feelings as both wold and human and his desire to just be human. Getting a glimpse inside Sam's head also enabled the author to convey Sam's pain and discomfort that comes with his change or near changes. As a reader, I did find myself getting so into a chapter and therefore a point view, that when the author switched to a different point of view in order to continue the story, I found myself missing the previous narrator. On the good side, whenever Grace was in school, switching point of views allowed the reader to continue to follow Sam as he continued with the plot. There was no down time and it managed to keep the story flowing, but he POV changes can be a bit daunting. Steifvator also writes very poetically which makes her visuals very vivid but can become a bit much at times. And snippets of lyrics adds to Sam's character.    As for the characters, Sam and Grace are likable enough. Sam is a little sugary sweet, but the type of hero I think young girls would latch on to. I wish he had a little bit more of a biting edge just to make him a little more well rounded. Grace was a strong character I could see young girls really relating to. She was a simple girl with an out of the ordinary boyfriend. One issue I did have with Grace stemmed from her parents. Grace's parents were just never around. They were there, but not there. When they were in the house, they had no idea what was going on. They were so absorbed in themselves that Grace just hardly seemed to exist to them.  Somehow I feel that this was a copout for the author, who never had to truly deal with parent/ boyfriend issues and made it way to easy for Grace to hide her boyfriend in her parents house and in her room. I would have appreciated the challenge of getting around Grace parents and struggling with teen relationship issues that would come up in everyday teenage life. By making Grace's parents a little more present, I would have been able to relate to Grace more. Plus, I found myself constantly scowling at her parents. I mean, the girl could have raised herself and practically did. It was just way to easy for Grace to deal with her werewolf boyfriend when her parents pretty much didn't exist. I would have liked to see a challenge there and see how Grace would have overcome it.    Other secondary characters, such as Graces friends and the werewolf pack, really helped keep the plot going. Sam's struggle with his changes is a battle both he and Grace tackle head on. Sam and Grace's relationship grows into a solid and heart felt connection and the reader urges them on to find a cure for Sam. As the plot progresses as Sam tries to uncover what is happening with a rogue wolf, we slowly uncover aspects of Grace that lead to another mystery (I wont mention more about Grace's subplot only to say I imagine it will become a major plot in upcoming books). The subplot grabbed me from the get go and I can't wait to uncover more about it. The build to the climax was a little slow, and I do wish there was more complexity to the leader of the wolf pack. And I know there was supposed to be tension in the friendships and relationships in Shiver but I just didn't feel the struggles all that much.    All in all I'd say Shiver was a good read that young adult readers will enjoy. I will be reading Linger to find out what will happen next for Sam and Grace but hope for more parental development and presence, and more complexity and tension in relationships (not just Sam and Grace, but parents, friends and wolf packs). If you love werewolves, a little fantasy and some clean young adult romance, give it a try. It is flawed but the lyrical writing will keep you entertained.
B000W93CHC|1.0|17.99 for an ebook?  Seriously and one that has been out for over a year.  The price is set by the publisher. I noticed that the price set for the coming epic Fall of Giants is 19.99.  Well that puts Follet and Penguin publishing on my DNR (do not read) list.
0143114085|4.0|Alice, new mother to baby Florence, has just returned from a trip to the gym to find the front door open and her husband asleep and her baby missing.  There is a baby in the crib but it is not her baby girl Florence.  Her husband David thinks it is Florence and believes Alice to be mad.  The police are called to investigate and Simon believes Alice while his commander, Charlie, does not and agrees with David.  Enter the mother-in-law who David and Alice live with and things really heat up.<br /><br />Vivienne, the mother-in-law, is used to being in control and having things her way.  She practically forces Alice to stay in the house in her gown and won't let her have her cell phone.  Meanwhile Charlie and Simon are butting heads over this case and what to do with it.  Simon has fallen in love with Alice and wants to be her knight-in-shining-armor while Charlie has a thing for Simon and is extremely jealous.  David is becoming more and more cruel to Alice but no one seems to be looking for baby Florence.<br /><br />Then we find out that David's first wife was killed right outside the gates of Vivienne's house - she was stabbed to death.  David and his first wife's son lives with Vivienne and David now in the same home as Alice and Florence.  To make matters more complicated Simon wants to reopen the killing of Laura, David's ex, even though the murderer has been in jail for years now over that crime.<br /><br />This is one book you have to keep reading to find out the ending but then the ending is a bit of a let down as it is too complicated to be believed but a good book overall.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|I already was interested in guitars etc. when I purchased this DVD. It is so much more. It is really about the essence of creativity. It also does a great job illustrating how different life perspectives influence the creative process. A really fun to watch and inspiring film.

0545123283|2.0|I like the main characters and the book is written pretty well but I just can't come to loving these two or caring about anyone else in these books. Every good book series should have those other characters you care for but I just don't care. The story has moved quite a bit forward which I liked. It's sad but it just doesn't do it for me and I'm sad. I found myself bored at ALOT also and that's my problem I had with Shiver till the end. And no book should be that boring. And I don't think I'll be reading the next book but well see. I'm glad others loved it. I wish so bad I could of.<br /><br />AND IF ANYBODY COMPARES IT TO TWILIGHT I might throw up. Why does every young adult book get compared to it ? Like it or not there won't be another Twilight. I'm sorry there just won't. Each story will have to do something else to be different to reach that level. And the Hunger Games series and Vampire Academy just might do it.
B003JZT2AW|4.0|Lastima que el grupo se haya separado, porque nos dejaron un legado sensacional de musica y arte. La mejor banda de muchisimo tiempo, no volver&aacute; a repetirse. Lastima que esta colecci&oacute;n solo ofrezca cajas de carton con discos y una caja de carton con videos, nada de estras. Pero bueno, apreciaremos la musica que para eso vivimos.
B000FC1192|5.0|I'm slightly biased because I think Neil Gaiman is an incredible author and I enjoy any work he has done. Coraline in particular was just fantastic. I saw the movie first, which I'm a little upset at myself about (I almost never watch a movie before I read a book) but I was pleased with both variations of the story.    I also must say the artwork was very nice to have. I found myself studying the artwork thoroughly as I encountered it in the text. The artwork really complimented the darkness of the story and made it even more creepy than it already was (if that's even possible).     This is a very quick read - I finished it in only a day. It is very difficult to put down - which was kind of depressing for me in the end because I wanted to read more! The last 10% of the book contains a \\"why did you write Coraline\\" and \\"Neil Gaiman Q&A\\" which was short and refreshing as well. Really get your money's worth with this one!
B002VWNICW|4.0|This is a review of the 2010 blu ray release.  I also own this movie on DVD, but decided to upgrade when the blu ray went on sale.  All I can say is I am glad I did not pay any more for the blu ray.  The title menu is a disaster.  The graphics and sound effects annoyingly remind one of powerpoint templates.  Who wants to feel like they are in the middle of a conference when watching a movie?  Whoever orchestrated the menu is not an artist, which stands in obvious contrast with the film. I would recommend waiting for the next blu ray release, if you are simply upgrading from DVD to blu ray.  Yes, the menu is that annoying!!! The film itself is excellent and keeps me from deducting more than 1 whole star.

B003A4IFGY|5.0|I never thought I would like a Tom Petty album as much as I liked Wildflowers. I like this one better. TP&TH have managed to do what most \\"artists\\" today cannot: fill an entire CD with eminently listenable, cohesive, consistent songs without making them all sound exactly the same. Do you negative reviewers know how difficult that is to do? This is not a departure for Tom Petty; this is an evolution. I think all future Tom Petty albums are going to be compared to this one to determine its greatness. The writing on this album is superb. The melodies are unforgettable and come back to your consciousness even though you may not have listened to the album for a while. I have to admit, I saw many of these songs performed in concert before I heard the studio tracks. As usual with songs performed in concert, I was a bit nonplussed with most of them -- with the exception of \\"Don't Pull Me Over\\" --  even though the sound quality at the concert was excellent.  I knew DPMO was an instant classic. But, then I listened to the entire album, and the context these songs were placed in on the album. Much more likable. This album just works.     I don't know what to tell you negative reviewers who claim that TP&TH have \\"forsaken\\" their rock-and-roll roots and that this is a \\"departure\\" for them. I couldn't disagree more. Tom Petty has always been about the bluesy side of rock-and-roll. If you don't realize that, you haven't been listening closely enough.     I got to download this album for free because I bought tickets to the Mojo concert. I'm sending $12 to the record company anyway.
B003BKF696|5.0|This is an absolutely fantastic album. I bought it after SiriusXMU featured them all last week. I'm 48 years old and can only compare this album to Bruce Springsteen's Darkness on the Edge of Town which I bought when I was 16. Darkness is my favorite album of all time despite constantly listening out for new artists. I'm not comparing the two albums musically...it's just THAT good! I'll be listening to High Violet when I'm 80!
