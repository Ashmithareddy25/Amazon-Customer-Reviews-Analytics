B001TH16DI|4.0|Box set includes all the big screen movies that contained and focused on the original series cast.  All the discs reproduce the movies in high definition clarity for video and 5.1 surround sound.  You can tell the picture on the older movies came from older filming technology that isn't as sharp as today's cinematography standards, however even the older movies have been remastered to clean up and sharpen the image, making it worth having in high definition.  Many movies include additional scenes which is another treat.  As a Star Trek fan, I felt the quality and price are well suited for this product and worth my purchase.  Amazon also beat all the local stores in price.
B002HR1W1K|5.0|You can't go wrong with the Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg, Nick Frost triumvirate(see Spaced, Shaun of the Dead).  The picture from the Blu-ray is beautiful, the sound packs an unexpected subwoofer punch, and there are extras galore.  Highly recommended.
0385733577|5.0|I really loved the way the story was written. it is an easy read and you'll get interested as you turn every page. it's really a one of a kind book. i look forward to get the 2nd book. the heat is on as the story continues and i can't wait to read what's gonna happen next. it's a must read. the cover is really great. the story is an excellent one. the characters were definitely great.    Nicholas Flamel - I liked him being funny but serious, and coward but courageous. it's like an irony but that makes up the great Nicholas Flamel.    Perenelle Flamel - I admired her willingness to help her husband and the children despite her being trapped in the arms of Dr. John Dee. I can see that she's really powerful.    Josh Newman - He's funny for being so immature and i liked the way he is described to be the doer and his twin sister is the thinker. i can sense his jealousy to his sister and i think that would be a cause of trouble somewhere ahead in the story.    Sophie Newman - I liked the way she thinks and decides. She acts as the older sister to his twin brother. i look forward to the moment when she can already master her spells.    Dr John Dee - the villain! He is always in the move for what he wants. I like him being the antagonist of the story, it makes much sense with his character and made the story more thrilling.    one funny but interesting thing is, the way magic can be smelled - rotten eggs, mint, vanilla ice cream, orange. for me, it's quite funny because it sounds unusual but interesting by the fact that it is a unique touch of the author and kinda made the story more interesting. i never had a hard time reading this book because i am always interested with magic and stuff since i was a kid. while reading this book, i have the most magical adventure in my whole life. i highly recommend this book to all fantasy lovers. as you open the book, you have entered a world of magic and you'll gonna love everything in it. ENJOY!!! ^^,
B00008FPWU|5.0|Way back in 1987 I bought the Rykodisc CD of Zappa's The Grand Wazoo.  Over the years the CD was either lost or sold, leaving me yearning again for another copy.  I then purchased the remastered edition of the album (unknowingly) and was quite shocked and disappointed when Zappa's son Dweezil interfered with the mixes and song order from the original master tapes.  Gone was George Duke's lush, rock-jazz fused electric piano solo in one particular song.  It was completely buried in the mix to benefit Ansley Dunbar's drumming, which now is brought up in the mix.  Another flaw was the very first song on the album is not The Grand Wazoo--its For Calvin and his next two hitch-hikers. Please keep away from the remastered edition of the Grand Wazoo and do what I did, which was to buy an original 1987 Rykodisc copy, used of course.  This one was mixed and approved by Frank himself.  Sorry, Dweezil.<br /><br />Greg Ilenda
B001AIRUP4|5.0|I have been a fan of Nightmare Before Christmas since it first came out. I have had it on VHS video, DVD and now Blu-ray. I have even seen it in the theatre in 3D. But on Blu-ray it is amazing, without exaggeration I have probably viewed this flick 20 times. But when I saw it in Blu-ray on a 55\\" HD big screen TV played on a Sony PS3, it was like watching it for the first time. I saw things in the background I have never noticed all the rich textures come out, seeing it this way I suspect was the original intent. You can really see the kind of care and craftsmanship that was put into this stop motion masterwork.
B000MCIBAW|5.0|I have always loved Strange Days by the Doors because of the imagery and flow of the songs.  It is an album that begs to be listened to in it's entirety, at one time.  The beautiful \\"You're Lost Little Girl,\\" and \\"Can't See Your Face...\\" are truly production masterpieces.  Hearing this album again remastered by Bruce Botnick sent me high above the clouds!  The music is so vibrant, clean and especially emotive of how creative Paul Rothchild and the Doors were back in 1967.  There was so much to draw from back in 1967, and the tumultuous atmosphere of America contributed greatly to Morrison's dark, sinister surrealism dripping songs.  Any fan of this period in Rock music, and the recording industry itself should not hesitate to aquire this album--the 40th anniversary \\"Strange Days.\\"    Greg Ilenda
0740748475|2.0|The two stars are for the binding, which is inexcusably shoddy, especially in a $90 set.<br /><br />The pages had become detached from the binding in volume I when I opened the box.  I sent the whole set back, which was a nuisance and is the first time I have ever returned a book to Amazon as defective.<br /><br />Now, with the second set, it is a month later and the pages have become detached from the binding again. Obviously, the fault on this is the publisher's, not Amazon's.<br /><br />The content of the books, of course, is marvelous. Bill Watterson is a great artist and the Calvin and Hobbes collection is an artistic masterwork of the 20th Century that will be read and enjoyed for decades if not centuries to come.<br /><br />It's ironic that I write this review at the fiery outset of the e-book war between Amazon and, well, everyone else, because this book is a magnificent example of 1) a p-book that would never, never, never work on the Kindle and 2) should never, never, never be priced at only $9.99. Indeed, I would argue that the e-book price should probably be higher than the price of the printed version, since there are so many new uses that become feasible on an e-reader with a high-res, landscape-capable color display.<br /><br />Recommendation: either a) wait for the color e-book version or b) buy this set, but plan on having it rebound.
1933308087|5.0|This book is a very good research tool for quilt historians, teachers or quilters.  Very informative!
B002JIOOB2|5.0|These were bought as a gift for me. I love the show, so of course I love the DVDs. I watched the series when it debuted and absolutely loved the show, however now that I am \\"older and wiser\\" I see how far-fetched the show is. I see it as a lesbian soap opera. All lesbians are not this glamorous, dress well, or look like they have eating disorders.... but I'm not reviewing the series... The DVDs are for collectors who want to keep watching the show even after it has left...
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Absolutely the best in price category.  I reviewed all the major and reputable products under $300 and could not find a set of over the ear phones that came close.  Be advised that sound/hearing is a personal sense and no two people will totally agree on sound.  However for allround base to treble response, clarity, etc.  these headphones at it.  I have four other pair for different uses, noise cancelling Sony and Phillips as well as Bose (don't waste the extra money).

B002TYZKIM|5.0|This is my all time fav movie of MJ I had to by 2 I cant stop watching it.
0545123267|2.0|To me this book had a very boring storyline. It didn't grab my attention which was why I was bored.
B002NXSRX4|4.0|... was alot better than I thought it was going to be. At first I was like... how is this going to be as good as what I grew up watching?!? Then I googled G.I. Joe and watched a few episodes. Man! That cartoon sucked! I can't believe I watched it so much as a kid.
0307716988|5.0|This is one of the best books on Michael out there, of course because it is the one and only book he wrote himself. Moonwalk was first released back in 1988 during the \\"Bad\\" era of his career fast becoming a New York Times Bestseller and another edition came out in October of 2009. Now why would someone have a biography of his life at only 29 years old? Simply because he's Michael Jackson and he's been asked to write one that's why. It took Michael a few years to write it and despite the fact that there are only 283 pages in the book, I loved every word of it. In Moonwalk MJ writes about his childhood, his family, his romances, the studios, his appearance at the time, his music and more. He gives the fans a wonderful read, he talks about every important event in his life, whether it's with the Jackson 5, during the Wizard of Oz or his solo career. To someone who doesn't love and don't understand Michael like his fans do, this biography may be a let-down because he doesn't really reveal anything in his book. His fans will love it as he tells his story his way.<br /><br />If you want to read about Michael make this your first read, just be aware that there are plenty of books on MJ that are absolute garbage. I think you'll notice when browsing that Michael's fans are honest about them. Moonwalk is not a long book but MJ tells us much of his past and his experiences such as the success he experimented with Thriller and the beating his father gave him as child. There are some very good pictures in it. There is a little sketch drawing as well and I like the fact that Michael signed a page feeling that his fans would have his autograph, the intention counts a lot. The 2009 edition of Moonwalk has an extended introduction and a new after forward which were very nice to read. Moonwalk is a must-have for any fans of the King of Pop. Rest in peace Michael we love you!
B002SJIO5E|5.0|... really like this movie. I hope they make a 2nd... it's totally set up for it.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|The quality and shipping of the DVD was outstanding. Thanks for the great price. I will be checking with you before I purchase anymore DVD's.
B002NXSRX4|5.0|Went to see this movie at the movies. Loved it. Hope i can soon get the whole cartoon series
0891419195|5.0|This book was highly recomended to me and it was an eye opener for me as I haven't read much about the pacific war, and this certainly was just that. The  conditions that these guys lived and fought under were appalling,I always felt that the bulge fighting was tough, but the island fighting  seemed like endless misery both from the elements and the fighting.I think comparisons with the Band of Brothers are not fair  in the sense that BoB was a combined story of an entire company, a lot of personalities,events and the like making it a richer narrative,Sledges book is the perspective of one mans experience and observations and is more gritty as a result.<br />This book gets five stars in my opinion.
B000E1MTZE|5.0|I still have my HD-DVD player. I rarely use it, but i like this trilogy of movies and the price was much better than bluray.
B000BJS4TO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy listening to this soundtrack.  It is relaxing, sensual, and a \\"great mood\\" producer.
B001RCD2DW|5.0|Wow...what a difference these make. I had been using an old set of Pioneers and they still sound pretty good after 36 years but I decided to treat myself. I had been getting distortion from some mp3 using the old Pioneers but the music comes through crystal clear and clean with the AKG's.<br />Very comfortable...I find myself spending several hours per session and usually forget I'm wearing them. One thing I noticed too was that I found myself turning the old Pioneers up to get the sound I wanted but the AKG's are superb even in low volume which will help save your ears.<br />I had researched Sennheiser 650, Beyerdynamic 880DT, Denon, Grado, just about everything out there. My biggest issue was there wasn't a store within 100 miles I could get to so I was stuck reviewing them online.<br />I didn't care about isolation or leakage as these were going to be used in relative quiet on my pc music station. I also wasn't going to use them on an IPod so this helped eliminate several choices as these had higher impedance than others and were not a good choice without an amp. I had already experienced closed back headphones so I wanted open back this time.<br />I eventually narrowed it down to the 650, the 880DT and the 702. The senns were substantially more expensive and when compared, didn't fare that much better...if any. The Beyers fared very well but the AKGs won me over with their transparency and accuracy. Nothing flavored...just music the way it was recorded.<br />Genre is very important to selecting a pair of cans. I like jazz, acoustic, new indie stuff...pretty much across the board listening. For that kind of listening, the AKG 702's are outstanding. I do not listen to rap or hip hop so I can't compare but from what I read, other reviewers say that if you're a bass head, these probably aren't for you.<br />I find the bass more than adequate and can hear even the slightest pick on an upright bass. I listened to Bitches Brew by Miles Davis the other night. I had always had trouble making it through that piece but with the AKG's it's like I had never heard it before. It's one of my favorite pieces now that I can actually hear it.<br />Great set of headphones...highly recommended.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|this movie is awesome.the IMAX scenes which are the scenes that take up the whole screen, are very good. Sound is very good. A must own bluray.
B00006G8HX|5.0|I'm disappointed in not being able to find full screen versions of this without having to buy a set. This DVD being a collector's edition special features type 2-disc set doesn't thrill me. But I do like the movie, and wouldn't grouse like a spoiled little brat so much but I don't buy something like this hoping to turn it back into money later on as if I am investing for resale value. I intend to keep this DVD just like I kept my VHS cassettes until technology obsoleted them. If you're still reading this, if this is the first of the original Star Trek series movies you're going to buy, you might want to shop for the full set of six. Star Trek TOS has each of the following - The Motion Picture; The Wrath of Khan; The Search For Spock; The Voyage Home; The Final Frontier; and, The Undiscovered Country. Those six have the original 1960's cast as the main characters, and I have seen them in a complete set. A full set of all six would be cheaper and you souldn't have to have some of them in wide screen format and others in full screen format. They're being discontinued by the manufacturer so I suppose that means new technology will make me buy them all over again on the new format whatever that is. I just want to watch the movie and enjoy it with my mind having to pay attention without knowing all the special effects tricks and fakery. But yes, I'm happy I bought this DVD.
B00005KARK|5.0|Sometimes it is hard to find the family classics - these guys ROCK!! Dumbo arrived at the earliest date and in great condition - the Tradition continues!!
1582701709|4.0|Good book, very interesting. It kinda of scared me though. The ideal states that whatever you think about a lot will come to pass in your life. So if you have bad thoughts then all bad things will happen to you
B002L5810I|5.0|I got this just out of curiosity and to it to  my MJ Collection.  Boy was I  surprised!  It's great!  Michael is performing throughout this movie.  I thought that it was for kids, but if you're a pure MJ fan, then you'll be glad you have it!  He sings and dances to \\"Come Together\\" and talk about sexy and great, it's a must have!  I've only had it for a little over a week and I just can't get enough of it.  Buy it now.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|This \\"Up\\" combo pack came with 3 different media: bluray, DVD, and digital copy.  And it was less than $20!  Amazing!  I love that I have a hi-def version for my HDTV, a DVD copy for my old TV (and in car player), and a digital copy for my iPhones.  My kids love the extras, esp. \\"Dug's Adventure\\"
B002UD56I6|5.0|[[ASIN:B002UD56I6 Michael Jackson: This Is It [Blu-ray]]]Really love this movie,as it is the last live performance that will ever be seen of him.  I loved the way he guided the dancers, the band and the singers into believing and feeling the way he did about his songs.  And the way he kindly gets on us about the way we are ruining the earth.  Wish I could see a clearer picture of his face, I know he's older, but I'd have love to see his face clearer.  Michael usually always ended his concerts with Man In the Mirror and every time the movie gets to that part I start crying, because it is a confirmation that he is not here, physically, on earth with us.  Buy the DVD, if you want a lasting memory of The Man, the King of Pop!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Best Star Trek movie I've seen yet.  The best part is all the one-liners used that we all know so well from the original series.
B0013AYRI2|5.0|Great album with bits of music hall, heavy metal and everything in between, all held together with Freddy Mercury's voice and Brian May's guitar.  Awesome! Worth the price just for \\"You're My Best Friend,\\" \\"Bohemian Rhapsody,\\" and \\"Death on Two Legs.\\"
B0000062FJ|5.0|Waiting - waiting to take off, goes nowhere.<br />Evil Woman  - a classic, what Santana is known for.<br />Shades of Time - not a bad song, but not a favorite.<br />Savor - too much cowbells and organs, sounds like Deep Purple.  Were they<br />  using the same organs/keyboards?<br />Jingo - a classic.<br />Persuasion - a classic, one of my top 5 Santana favorite songs.<br />Treat - a nice treat to a latin-rock instrumental.<br />You Just Dont Care - not bad, but not a classic.<br />Soul Sacrifice - a classic.  The original version.<br /><br />Overall a great album. As strong a debut as Hendrix's 'Are You Experienced?'.<br />To be followed by 2 great albums as well. In the 70's & 80's it would go<br />downhill.  Back on top with 'Supernatural'; 'Shaman' isnt as good, but<br />not bad either.<br />My other Santana favorite albums: Santana Brothers, Milagro, Zebop!,<br />Ceremony: remixes&rarities, Festival, Amigos.
B00138F6W0|5.0|\\"Killer Queen,\\" \\"Bring Back That Leroy Brown,\\" \\"Flick of the Wrist\\" are all great Queen tunes.  The entire album holds together well after all these years.
B0026P3G12|5.0|It is so nice to find someone who has brought back the vocal to music today. No hype, just a beautiful voice that you know can sing anything and make it sound great. Like Randy Jackson says, \\"if you can sing, you can sing anything\\" and Susan can flat sing. I have always thought that if I purchased a CD and found two good songs on it, I was happy. I think you will find that you have no insterest in skipping over her song list.  Dean
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|Some artists who continue to perform decades after their peak become a little embarrassing to watch, but because of their legendary status we make concessions for their age. Not so with Leonard Cohen. I dare say she's at the top of his form here. You'll play this disc over and over. Great performance from all involved, beautifully recorded.
0060922583|4.0|This is one of the most interesting books I have read. It is the first time I read about this new concept and I liked the way it has been explained.
B001JQTSG6|5.0|Raging Bull is probably the greatest movie about a boxer ever made.  Jake Lemotta was NOT one of the nicest or smartest middleweight champions of all time, but Robert  De Niro made the character understandable but not sympathetic.  The picture is now more stunning that ever for home viewing in blu-ray.  I give it my highest recommendation.
0140306013|5.0|My favorite book, no matter how old I get.  :)      The language is a bit high-level, so I'm not sure elementary-aged kids would get much out of it, but for middle school and up, it's definitely worth it.  The story itself is powerful: The lead character is Hazel, who starts out low in the hierarchy of rabbit society and unsure of himself, but through the course of the story, he rises to meet the challenges of leadership with compassion and sensibility, eventually leading his small band of rabbits to a new home they must then defend.  I love Bigwig's big, brave heart and Fiver's courage.  The author does a great job of creating a strong sense of 'rabbit society,' complete with language, mythology, and mannerisms.      Really, if you haven't read this story, you need to.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|I've owned AKG 240's since the late 70's and they are fantastic. Very durable as I am just buying my 3rd pair in 30+ years. Use them several times a week. Amazing sound - clear and balanced. I've seen more than one music documentary where the 240's were shown used in the studio(s)- so that should tell you something. I've been in music for over 30 years and really have no use for any other headphones. And the price is outstanding for the quality.
B0002UOK04|5.0|Great album overall. I am definitely surprised that this band has not gained more recognition. All of the instruments are amazingly well done. The singer/guitarist is sick at guitar. His neoclassical solos are a major highlight of nearly all the songs. The drumming also suits the music incredibly well. What I like most about this album is the focus on melody present throughout the album--it's not all about riffs. Go buy it!
B0026P3G12|5.0|I bought the CD for my mom -- but once she played it I found myself enjoying the music very much and now play it in my car all the time.  I guess I'll have to buy another copy for mom.
0307716988|5.0|Once again, Amazon has proven to be reliable, rapid in shipment, and offering quality products advertised with accuracy and honesty.  I buy all my books from Amazon -- why look elsewhere?
1401923119|5.0|I'm still in the middle of reading this book and I have to say it is incredibly inspiring. For anyone who is looking for answers, who questions the generell mass acceptance that science is always right, for Spirtual Healers and for all who work in the health sector this book is a must. For anyone who wants to live their life diffently but feels that they are at the mercy of their genes this book is a wake up call.
B000VLOKQI|4.0|Count me in the non-fan camp, though I do appreciate the musical contributions of John Entwhistle, Keith Moon and, to a lesser extent, Pete Townsend. Even Roger Daltrey's singing, which I have found to be an acquired taste, comes through here as eloquent in his old age. The main film recounts the band's storied history, but I found the extras most interesting, especially the four bios of the band members, detailing where they stand in rock history. I really liked the footage of the current two band members recording a new song with Zak Starkey on drums and the bass player from ELP. Quite revealing of their methods. The Who were four lead players all together at once in their heyday, which made for exciting live shows, even if the 'rock operas' were a bit overrated and bloated at times.
B002WTC92E|1.0|I am single, in my 30s and live in Manhattan.  I could not find one redeeming quality for any of these characters.  They are shallow, selfish and not worth caring about.  I hated this book, and was sorry I bought it.  I ended up skimming after reading halfway through it.  The character Adriana is particularly irritating. I think the author was trying to emulate a Sex and the City type of character and ended up creating someone who you could care less about.  I actually wanted something bad to happen to her!      I was in an airport and needed to pass the time and I ended up buying this and regretted it.  I felt compelled to write a review, even though once I was on this site, I see there are many others.  I still wanted to add mine to the mix.    Dont buy, borrow or read this book.  You will regret the wasted hours!
B0026P3G12|5.0|What a wonderful gift we have been given through Susan Boyle.  Her mastery of phrasing and control are breathtaking.  I look forward to hearing more from her in the future and hope to do so!

B0013FSL3E|3.0|Movie was OK, but definitely not of the caliber of Monsters Inc. or The Incredibles.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|If you love documentary, you would love Planet Earth. The Blu Ray version gives me a way to get close to nature without actually leaving the comfort of my living room. What i like about Planet Earth is that it gives a board spectrum of the natural world that we do not know or know little. But the flip side is not getting enough of a specific topic after your sensory intakes and interests are aroused by the great story telling and images presented to you. But it's still a great buy for nature lovers.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|Bought this for my brother since I was already a huge Muse fan.  now I have another convert!  This album rocks, is reflective, a great combination of classical and alternative hard rock.  Their best so far, in my opinion.

B00275EGWY|1.0|I was deployed as a Combat Engineer in Baghdad with the 1st Cav division Feb 04 - Feb 05.  I found this movie was very Hollywood.  They did a nice selection in the location of the film as it did look a lot like Baghdad.  However, the story line was too flawed.  I was a bit confused why the soldiers were wearing ACU uniforms as, while I was there, those were not issued.  The film supposedly was taking place in 2004.  Soldiers were still wearing the DCU uniforms in 2004.  I was highly disturbed by the portrayal of the main character having no accountability.  He seemed to go where ever he wanted, when ever he wanted and did what ever he wanted without having to answer to a higher commander.  This of course, any veteran, anyone in the military, will tell you simply does not happen.  There is always someone that you have to answer to for your actions.  When he snuck off of post to find Beckhams father was just absurd and pure Hollywood.  I was disturbed by the scene with the team of EOD guys drinking.  Alcohol was forbidden and still is.  Of course there were many soldiers who obtained alcohol, but by and large, most did not drink.  To see an entire \\"team\\" sharing booze together just was not very realistic.  The team also always seemed to operate independently.  They never seemed to be with anyone else and never had support.  Watching the three of them clear a building by themselves was silly.  Why was ther enever any supporting infantry units?  They traveled by themselves in a lone hummer.  In 2004, if I remember correctly, we were not allowed outside the wire unless we were in a convoy of at least 3 vehicles.  All in all, this was a pure Hollywood film and certainly does not live up to the billing as being the most \\"realistic\\" Iraq war movie so far.
B001ICC3ZY|2.0|I was not signed except by someone who previously owned the book -   and that someone was not John Grisham!!!!

0694481912|5.0|Millions of people have seen the movie and heard the story, but not enough people have actually read the book.  If you liked the movie, you'll love the book!  It is required reading in my household.  I have three children (20, 16 and 13).  Each is required to read the book.  The story is riveting and the writing style and quality is unmatched.    I bought it used.  Great choice!  No need to spend big bucks.    After you read this novel, I am certain you'll thank me.
B002UZCJ8Y|1.0|I agree with many, less than complementary, viewers that this story has been told many times in the past. I could be nice and say borrowed or less nice and say stolen but studios do have a right to make some quick money. The most famous of the many \\"robots-as-humans\\" films is, of course, the unmatched \\"Blade Runner\\" which \\"Surrogates\\" constantly reminded me of. Even the '70s/'80s sci-fi moralizing was REPLICATED in vitro in this film. What was really cheap, as much of the movie obviously was, was the use  of '80s level computer technical concepts such as the system reset, colorful flashing graphics and simplistic one key stroke encryption.   Some other retread ideas were:    (a.) robots displacing humanity.    (b.) a secret disgruntled scientist.    (c.) proverbial military supersecret SECRET WEAPON.     (d.) a tension building antagonist - the poor & illiterate reggae-like masses opposing technology any more complex than a hammer (sorry, stone tool).     (e.) corporate greed in cahoots with the military - of course. Probably, still relevant.     (f.) an easily digestible script that would be palatable to the fifth grade demographics.

B000OVLBGC|5.0|A police spy is assigned to monitor a renowned author and playwright suspected of spreading heretical pamphlets objecting to the limitations on rights and freedoms in partitioned Eastern Germany. In the process of monitoring the author's conversations and visits, the spy is increasingly troubled by the integrity, nobility, and humanity of the person he is assigned to convict.<br /><br />The Lives of Others illustrates the pull of a guileless, hopeful idealism on a simple civil servant and gives us a touching and bittersweet definition of what it means to be human. In the midst of intense injustice, misery and grief of partitioned Eastern Germany, it is a story of humanity, trust, and gratitude.
0375842209|5.0|Death speaks in such a gentle caring voice.   The characters are so touching and vivid, and their experiences so memorable and so touching. I have been recommending this book to everyone I come across.   It is such a worthwhile read, that will always stay in your heart.
1400031001|5.0|William Boyd had me from the first page until the last. I hated for it to end. Marvelous storytelling through a journal that takes the reader from Logan Gonzago Mountstuart's early life in Montevideo Uruguay to English public school to Oxford to a whirlwind adult life through some of the major events of the twentieth century until a heart attack in the French country side take's Mountstuart's life in 1991 at age 85. But what a life it was - a flawed but so human life. One of the most enjoyable books I've read in years.<br />Dennis McKay<br />Author of Fallow's Field and Once Upon Wisconsin

B00127RAJY|4.0|At first I was skeptical that a home DVD could give me much of a workout, but boy was I wrong. I hadn't worked out for awhile when I started this program. After the first day I'd never been so sore in my life! Anyway, the only criticism I have is that I don't like working out with weights 2 days in a row. I had always been taught that you need to give your muscles at least a day to recover. So I bought the \\"Biggest Loser Cardio Max\\" to alternate and to give me more of a workout variety. So far it's been great. My clothes are fitting better and I just feel a hundred times better.

B000002J1M|4.0|This album takes its place with the Prog Rock classics of its day, such as Pink Floyd's \\"Dark side of the moon\\" and \\"Meddle\\" and King Crimson's \\"Lizard\\". Genesis's \\"Foxtrot\\" continues the direction of the second and third album with this third album. The album begins with beautifully disembodied drowns and then drifts into  the first track, \\"Watcher of the Skies\\", It has an aggressive sound that is delicate and pastoral. \\"Suppers Ready\\" is the album's highlight; running 23 min. demonstrates the bands musicianship and upbeat insanity. \\" Get'em out by Friday\\", another great track, is a venture of the conceptual pop song contained in the conceptual album.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|My husband is a remarkably talented gamer. He's plays everything from \\"Ghosbusters\\" to \\"Little Big Planet,\\" from \\"Modern Warfare 2\\" to \\"Rock Band\\" to NSMB. He's played almost every system available in the USA, but prefers the diversity of PS3. Out of necessity, he mastered the art of playing with the TV on mute (a courtesy to me, we all know how late things can go). But all that changed, this past holiday season when his amazingly thoughtful wife (that would be me!) bought him a brand spanking new pair of these! So far, he's had nothing but positive things to say. Specifically, he's mentioned the volume controls, overall flexibility and comfort, chat boost, the surround sound effect, and crispness of in game sound. So he gives it an A in gaming and I give it an A+ for letting me sleep :)

0307155102|5.0|I bought this book for my two year old granddaughter but my five year old granddaughter is enjoying this as well.  She is using this book to learn to read, the words are easier for her to sound out, the only problem we are having is she doesn't want to put it down to eat or go to bed.  My daughter had this book when she was a toddler and loved it. I love this book and would recommend for all children, sparks their interest in reading and looking at all the different pictures.

B00003CXXS|1.0|Oh I bet I wasn't the only one that was looking forward to this when the trailer came out.  Jurassic Park holds a special place in my heart.  It terrorized me when I was little and now I absolutely adore it.  The first two movies together are a suburb example of CG integrated into the realistic and gritty look of movies made in the mid-90's.  Jurassic Park 3 apparently ignored what had made the first two so good and loses much of that movie magic.    So yes, we're going back to the island.  Sam Neill makes a re-appearance as Alan Grant and is paid to go back to the islands in order to fund his research.  Now first off on a personal note, I HATED how Alan and Ellie didn't end up together.  Call me a snotty romantic, but I loved how in the first movie there wasn't an emphasis on their relationship.  Instead they act like a real compatible couple, understanding each others actions without words or drawn-out speeches.  Right from this first scene I knew the movie was in trouble.    Once at the island they go through the typical dinosaur chases as Alan is led by a married couple looking for their son.  Here's the main problem with this plot line.  There isn't anything particularly 'dinosaur' about these people.  The other movies befitted from having experts as lead characters, allowing for the sorta believable accident of something going wrong.  With normal people the whole affair comes off as a B-list island horror movie.      We see this heavily in the action sequences.  In movies 1 and 2 everyone has at least some sense of what they are doing.  Whether or not they make the right decision is par for the course, but at least the generally know how to the get out.  In Jurassic Park 3 however each dinosaur chase is too-over blown with a de-emphasis on the whole human intelligence.  For example in the kitchen scene of the first movie, everything slows down enough for the audience to grasp exactly how smart the velociraptors are so when Lex and Tim succeed in surviving we are genially moved.  On the flip-side in the Jurassic Park 3, we don't really understand what the significance of that duck-billed T-rex really is.  Alan only briefly mentions it and its action sequences are too fast for us to really get a sense of tension and danger.      So in summary I didn't really like this movie.  Unlike Lost World, this sequel doesn't add anything new to the Jurassic Park universe and we would have been better without it.  As a horror action-movie it was well done, but it just doesn't stand-up to its predecessors.
0316666343|4.0|Much better than the movie, a quick and enjoyable read for those looking for a good book to tote to work. I bought a used copy and for what I paid for it ($4) I couldn't have been disappointed.
B002IYEQR4|5.0|I am a huge Watchmen fan and I really, really enjoyed the movie. I thought the atmosphere was spot-on and captured the comic unlike any movie to date. This is a must have, unless you have already purchased the Director's Cut. Having the \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\" woven into the movie was a great addition for any fan of the graphic novel, but it may turn away people not familiar with the Watchman. Clocking in at 3 hours 30ish min, this is no short movie.   Things included in the Ultimate Cut:  Disc 1: Ultimate Cut Version of Watchmen  Disc 2: Special Features  Disc 3: Digital Copy of the Theatrical Version  Disc 4: Blu-Ray of the Watchmen Graphic Novel, animated and narrated.
B000UJ48UO|5.0|This is a great classic war movie, it gave me flash backs of boot camp.  I could not tell the difference between the DVD version and the Blue Ray version.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|I am a Harry Potter fan to begin with.  So before even watching this movie I knew I would like it.  But I am also a picky book to movie watcher.  I hate it when some books are made into movies and they totally change the whole story plot and just use the title.  Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is not one of those horrible 'book to movie' movie.  Actually it is one of my more favorite Harry Potters from the 6 movies so far.  It isn't EXACTLY like the book, but it doesn't go too far off the path as to where I am hating the movie for messing up a scene.  If you like adventure, and some awkward teen moments, you'll like this movie.      You can tell that the main trio (Harry, Ron Hermione) is growing up because the movies are getting a bit darker and such.  and the acting has gotten better through the 6 movies as well
0060574216|5.0|Great read, again.  Timeless and basic advice good to remind oneself of for all sorts of communication challenges at work and home.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|When I first watched the first season of True Blood I was hooked. I went out and bought the first book of the Sookie series. Come to find out that its nothing like the book. Of course the book is like less then 300 pages and theres like 12 hours of the first season which revolves around the first book. There was hints of the book here and there in the series. Which you always expect when a book is turned into a movie of sorts.  Altogether they (book & first season of True Blood) are both good. Just dont expect the show to follow the books.   Oh, and i got a great deal on the price compared to what it would of cost me in the stores!!!!!
B002UD56I6|5.0|This is a nicely done tribute to Mr Jackson.  The camera work is great, the sound is even better.  The editing created some forward motion and was very well done  I am not a Michael Jackson fan but from this DVD I could see the skill this performer had and came to appreciate his contribution to American music.
B001NXDIMK|5.0|This is a terrific show, very well done. It is compex, yet very interesting and really keeps you going. I enjoyed both season one and two, however I would give season two all 5 stars, yet I would give season one 4 stars for the questions left unanswered. I highly recommend this show. Glen Close does a fantastic job!
B00005JKGZ|5.0|How can you go wrong with great acting, and classic songs that just make you want to sing along?    LOVE this movie
B002X9GX4S|4.0|Alesana has always been one of those bands that found their way on to a burned CD of mine, but only a song or two. I would typically get bored with that song very quickly, forget about the band, and i would never care enough to buy a CD of theirs, but with this release, that's changed.   I was at hot topic one day and just for the hell of it, i decided to see if they had a decent song on this one.  To my surprise... the first 4 songs i clicked on i absolutely loved, this entire CD is very, VERY good. I giant improvement from the previous releases by them. I don't have time to get in to everything i love about this CD, but i will say it's definitely, FINALLY a CD by them that's well worth the money.     My favorites songs...  1. Hymn For The Shameless  2. Curse Of The Virgin Canvas  3. The Murderer  4. The Thespian      Really, check them out!! Very good.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|Inglourious basterds is a fictional take on WWII and right form the start this movie grips you into a feel for the characters and story line. From beginning the end the film is oozing with suspense, but also a hint of comedic taste that only Quentin can blend so well. In Inglourious Basterds most of Quentins comedic output is shown through Brad Pitt's character, so to the people complaining about his outlandish accent, it was to compliment or ampilfy the comedic tones of his lines. The most profound actor of the lot in this movie is without question Christoph Waltz (Hans Landa). His acting is superb, believable, and definately worth an oscar. The storyline in the movie is explained mostly through dialogue and where the heart of suspense is. So yes, there will be alot of talking and subtitles, but keep in mind it helps move along the story and build suspense. The film has enough action and gore to keep most people entertained, but some viewers have said that it is to violent or gory. This comment seems to be irrevelant though, after all it is a war movie by Quentin Tarantino and in no way, shape, or form does it take away from the Triple-A quality the movie offers. It is most definately a movie i would highly suggest.
B000O179EK|1.0|I purchased this and didnt realize it was a HD DVD so it wouldnt play on anything I own. Wasted my money, but I learned to read the fine print and slow down when making an order on line.

B002XZ62HK|5.0|I have a hard time deciding which Celtic Woman collection is my favorite because I genuinely enjoy them all, even the Chistmas CD which I listen to regardless of the season.  But, this performance at Powerscourt House and Gardens has blown me away.  I watched nearly every performance on PBS back in December so I readily pre-ordered the Deluxe Edition CD during the holidays.  As I anticipated the arrival of Songs From the Heart CD I realized that I really missed seeing the performance and decided at the last minute to order the DVD as well and they both came on Friday!    I'm no musician nor do I sing all that well but I know what God given talent sounds like and these ladies have IT.  As they like to say on American Idol, these ladies can sing the phone book and I'd feel inspired, uplifted, and blessed to have had the oportunity to experiance their angelic voices!  From my perspective, I have nothing negative to report.  I would buy this CD again, as well as all of the other Celtic Women CD's.  I'm a die-hard fan in the deep south USA!  Hopefully these ladies will enjoy a long career and continue to bless us with their gift of song.  Rest assured, I'll keep buying it.
B0015AARJI|4.0|I bought this on because my old roommates pit bull decided she wanted to play the ps3 with its many features and expensive price tag. Upon inspection of the damage she gnawed off the thumb sticks jammed the left trigger and ate the right handle off. Amazingly it still worked, but game play was out of the question cause the thumb sticks were little daggers. well three months later after countless promises to pay me back by the dogs owner, i decided to buy it my self. I paid forty here because it was cyber monday and they were having a sale. The controller works great, better then third party controllers with the usb hook in. The only third party controllers work well when coupled with the xbox 360. pit bulls are temperamental dogs, so if you don't know how to raise a dog or are a macho dude looking for a macho dog...don't just get a shelter lab or a cat. peace easy.
B0014Z4ON4|5.0|Making over $330,000,000 at the boxoffice, \\"Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom\\" was met with moderate critical response. Even many of those who worked on the film, including director Steven Speilberg, commented that the movie was too dark and that it's the one film he has made that doesn't have an ounce of his personality in it. He also stated the best part of the film was meeting Kate Capshaw (who would become his wife), who co-starred with Harrison Ford. Even Capshaw stated that the film was mediocore and that she played the typical \\"dumb blond\\" role to the hilt. This movie was actually a prequel to the more entertaining \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\". In this outing Indy must try to resure children who are in a child slavery ring in India. The movie, I believe, is fast-paced, engrossing, nail-biting, scary, and a thrill-ride, everything an Indiana Jones flick should be, despite the movie makers comments. The film has been digitally restored from its original print and comes with 5.1 digital surround sound for impeccable hearing quality. This was followed by two more sequels in the Iniana Jones franchise that were huge hits at the boxoffice. This DVD is also available in a deluxe four DVD set that features the first three Indy movies along with a bonus DVD.

0446567337|5.0|I loved this book. I couldn't put it down and finished it in a day. It was such an easy read and you truly got to know the characters. The book is written through John's perspective and I found my heart reaching out to him throughout the entire book. This was my first Nicholas Sparks novel and it definitely will not be my last. I just went out and bought some more of his books. I can't wait for the movie!
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|Cloverfield is an interesting film, the shakiness of the camera is not for those who get sick with moving/shaking images but the plot is well developed and the characters are memorable.
B001S86J0I|5.0|I am a big Star Trek fan and this parody kept me laughing. I loved it.
B002T9H2L0|1.0|OK, the opening sequence is \\"masterful.\\" However, the rest of the movie is awful, boring, poorly constructed, poorly acted... oh well, you get the point. If Quentin Tarantino hadn't been involved in this turkey, no one would pay it any attention at all, except maybe for several razzies. We don't learn anything in the movie, and it isn't even entertaining. Your time on the planet is limited. Don't spend it watching this piece of garbage!
0316017922|4.0|This book makes you think about what it takes to be an \\"outlier\\".  It isn't all brains and charisma.  Very interesting book with many real world examples of success and a detailed breakdown of how it was achieved.
0316069906|1.0|The audio version of this book is horrid. Jonathan Todd Ross reads with such metered delivery and over-pronunciation, every word is chewed to death. The delivery sounds much like an automated voice reading back a phone number with weird choppy sing-song intonation.<br /><br />I don't know if it is Foer's intention for this to be difficult listening, but it is a terrible chore. Seriously, this is the worst audio book I've encountered. Ross sounds like he is reading this to an idiot while laughing out the other side of his face.
0312370849|5.0|Based in historical fact, this novel weaves a life-changing, poignant, beautiful story about a strong woman searching for truth.
B002UXRH10|5.0|I love this album and Rihanna! She is a very good singer and these songs are very appealing. Yes, she is changing, but in a good way in my opinion. I love how this album combines love songs with angry ones. The lyrics are very well chosen and this album fits the genre of pop very well, just how I like it.
0375703764|5.0|This is a great book, I've liked it for a long time, and I'm glad to now have a copy for myself. The price was really affordable and for the fact they said significant damage to the cover I was surprised-it was only a couple of scuffs.I recommend the book and the buyer and won't hesitate to buy from them again :)
0345495004|4.0|The book was a real page turner, and it was fun pretending to be in the minds of the characters.  It is a great book to discuss with friends or a book club.
0783114222|5.0|This four disc collection was purchased as a Christmas gift that was on my son-in-law's wish list.  I assume that he's enjoying it as well as sharing it with his young son.  No negative feedback from them, so I'm giving it five stars.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I was excited to see this product at a great price.  I ordered with an Amozon gift certificate and paid the difference with my credit card.  Everything went smoothly and the item came in a few days (well within estimated time).  I would order from this supplier again.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|My 11 year old son got this from Santa for Christmas, and our whole family pretty much watched it beginning to end over the next week.  Not only was it a great story, with drama and suspense that kept you on the edge of your seat at times, but it lets kids who weren't around when it all happened see how they worked with what they had to get to the moon and back.  As my son said - an iPhone has 10 times the computing power of the instruments of an Apollo rocket.
B001P06GX4|5.0|We first played this game on vacation and then bought it for Christmas. Its fun for the whole family, even our 5 year old knows how to play! Great game! My husband and I play it a lot too.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|A great addition to the Star Trek franchise that makes one hungry for more.  Zachary Quinto makes a super younger Spock and Chris Pine is a better Kirk than William Shatner ever was.  If you have missed it, and you are a Trekkie, see it.

B00204AA0O|5.0|As usual, Regina did not disappoint. The variety of producers including Jeff Lynn of ELO gave the songs added dimension with a more complete sound without overpowering Regina's strenghts---her incredible voice and her piano. Great album!
B0000041TD|5.0|This is a terrific recording.  Pavarotti and Freni sing beautifully and Karajan's conducting is quite sublime.

B000BNI95Y|5.0|This CD covers the range of human emotion, has songs that are just fun and songs that are emotional and introspective. Goes from the happy anticipation of a meeting with your lover in \\"7 Horas\\" to the lost love in \\"Cuidandote\\" and \\"Razones\\". Of course everybody talks about the most famous song in the CD, \\"Malo\\" which don't get me wrong, is great, but there is also \\"Corre\\" which just rocks and \\"Que Nadie Me  Levante La Voz\\" which just makes you laugh. But even for non-spanish speakers that miss out on the great lyrics, the music the and great delivery of Bebe are worth buying the CD. When I first bought the CD I thought I would only like a couple of the songs but I have to say I like pretty much all of it. Although I wish the engineer and producer had not made the recording of \\"Razones\\" sound like it was recorded in a hallway because at times you can barely hear Bebe sing and that is a shame because it is a beautiful song.
B002VKE1K2|3.0|Shot with a Sony's video camera and made with a modest budget of $15,000, \\"Paranormal Activity\\" proved a big hit (more than $ 100 million in US alone) and has already garnered critical acclaims everywhere (81 % positive reviews according to the rottentomatoes site). I can understand the first part - we still remember the hype of \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" back in 1999 - but as to the latter, well, frankly I don't know what to say.     I'm not saying \\"Paranormal Activity\\" is a total disaster. The film is not entirely scare-free and I confess I jumped in the seat several times. But writer/director Oren Peli overuses the \\"jack-in-the-box\\" type routine such as sudden big noises and clichéd visual tricks. The image from the static camera showing the two protagonists is creepy at first, but it gradually becomes predictable, if not boring, for most of the horror fans.    The story is OK, just a usual one about two residents, Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat) living together in a San Diego house, terrorized by some \\"entity\\" and the paranormal activity that gets worse. The acting is acceptable, but as the story goes on, some viewers might think to themselves: \\"But I wouldn't leave the door open when I know my house is haunted\\" or \\"I wouldn't continue to shoot a camera when my girlfriend is obviously terrified and in danger.\\" In fact, the character of Micah is so annoying and even stupid that by the time the film wraps up, I stopped to care what happens to them.    Keep your expectation low and perhaps you will enjoy the ride.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|I'll be brief. This album rocks. It is a CRUSHING, masterful, looooong overdue return to form for one of heavy metal's most beloved ambassadors. Don't listen to the detractors. The boys still got it. It's all here : thrash, speed, fury, angst. If you're like me and has loved Metallica through thick ( And Justice For All ), and thin ( St. Anger ),then you will no doubt deem this latest offering one of their best in years. If you're a 'fan of old', then you will absolutely adore this. Do yourself a favor --- go get it.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|Reviewers Remember it's just a story, please. I thought it was very well written in the eyes of a dead victim. What a concept. Couldn't put it down till it was done even though I waited a whole day to read the last chapter I just didn't want it to end. I'll admit it seems it's not for every man out there.But then again...
1416595554|5.0|I could not put this novel down! I thought it was well written and paced, but I did find myself skimming through the last section because by that point, (2AM work night)I needed to know the conclusion. I wept like I did as a teenager 30 years ago when I finished Jane Eyre.  Some knowledge of Russian history is helpful but not required.  Read it!!
0810982862|5.0|We've all read the main complaints: Too short, too costly, yeah, yeah, yeah. But I rather enjoy this book. It may not be the BEST art book, but it is full of amazing artwork. And even though there are only about 100 pages, these pages are freakin' HUGE, with two or three GIANT fold out pages of conceptual artwork. The whole thought process behind creating the creatures of Pandora (including the ever so beautiful Na'vi) is captivating to say the least, and I'm not just saying this because I intend on seeing the movie ten more times.<br /><br />I also suggest the Pandora Activist Guide if you're more prone to smaller carry-with-you books. But, trust me, there are several worse ways to spend twenty bucks.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|What else can I say, I LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie. Makes me laugh each and everytime I watch it!!!
B0012CH350|5.0|Fits the grill, keeps it shiny.  Just don't put it on when the grill is hot.
B000002P5W|5.0|If I was forced to pick one album to take with me to be stranded on a deserted island, it would probably be this one.  Well, either this one, or Meddle by Pink Floyd, or, heck, Are You Experienced or Electric Ladyland.  But even though it's pretty much impossible to rate the Hendrix albums between themselves, they are all equally amazing, I always seem to pick this one as my favorite.  Are You Experienced is composed almost entirely of classic masterpieces, Electric Ladyland gave Hendrix the room to experiment in awesome ways(1983 . ..  If a Merman I Should Turn to Be is incredible, as are, of course, Voodoo Child(Slight Return) and All Along the Watchtower) but this one holds a special place in my heart for oozing '60's psychedelic rock awesomeness, and for containing 3 songs so frickin' badass that they just about defy description.  Castles Made of Sand, Little Wing, and Bold as Love are just other-worldly.  Jimi's songwriting was as good as anyone's, and he's in top form here.  In addition, the guitar-playing on all three tracks is beyond belief.  Little Wing is well respected for it's beautiful guitar intricacies, but I'm shocked that Bold as Love doesn't get more respect for the guitar heroics on display.  I can listen to the lead guitar after the break with the flanged drums over and over, and have my mind blown every time.  Whereas I consider Voodoo Child(Slight Return) to be the greatest guitar song ever, I consider the playing at the end of Bold as Love to be the greatest snippet of guitar playing I've ever heard.  There are a few songs on this album that don't rank among my personal favorites, but when you add Spanish Castle Magic, One Rainy Wish, etc. to the list of songs I already mentioned, it's just a mind-bogglingly awesome album.
B001684L0A|5.0|This was one of the first blu ray items I purchased. It was a great price and it was stunning to watch. We watched it on consecutive nights and couldn't wait to watch each episode. This set is not just for history bufffs, the stunning sets and costumes are worth commenting on also.
6304711891|5.0|I love Nick Cage in his bigger films like this, con air & gone in 60 seconds, and face off.  I think he is one of my favorite actors.
B002MBAJ4M|5.0|I have seen Gov't Mule a few times in person and enjoyed their shows.  I really do like this new release from them. Hard driving rock vibe.  Not the typical overplayed garbage that is out there aplenty.  Thanks to the Mule for putting this out, my fav to date.
B002T9H2MO|4.0|WARNING!  SPOILERS AHEAD!  WARNING!  SPOILERS AHEAD!    THE FILM:  \\"Moon\\" follows in the tradition of the thoughtful sci-fi movies of the 60s, 70s and 80s (epitomized by \\"2001\\"), a kind of film that doesn't seem to be made much anymore.  In a role written specifically for him, Sam Rockwell plays Sam Bell, a corporate astronaut in a future year wisely left unspecified.  Earth's energy problems have finally been solved by the mining of helium-3 on the far side of the moon.  Sam is alone on the moon base, his only companion a roboticized, artificially intelligent computer named Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey).  Sam is looking forward to returning to Earth and his wife and young daughter, from whom he can receive only prerecorded messages due to a communications satellite failure.  Extremely tired as he approaches the end of his three-year contract, Sam begins to have hallucinations of a mysterious teenage girl, and one such episode causes him to have a serious accident on the lunar surface.  In the accident's aftermath Sam will learn that nothing about his situation is what it seems.    Superbly directed by Duncan Jones (son of David Bowie), \\"Moon\\" can be interpreted as a liberal parable about the evils of big energy companies, and in fact the film's final line of dialogue makes its political orientation rather too clear.  But, on a deeper level, \\"Moon\\" poses the question of whether our society has become so selfish and uncaring that we can no longer treat even **ourselves** with compassion and respect.  Once upon a time, the great philosophers and moral teachers of the past asked us to treat people very different from us with charity and concern.  \\"Moon\\" asks whether we have now regressed to the point where a man needs to learn to show **himself** kindness rather than hostility before rejoining the rest of the human race.  Barack Obama does not want us to return to the moon, perhaps because we are already there.    THE DVD:  I did not get the chance to see all the special features on this disc.  There are two audio commentaries, both of which can be accompanied by optional subtitles -- an excellent feature that I wish more DVDs would include.  Two Q&As with Duncan Jones -- one from Sundance, the other from a screening for NASA employees -- feature the director answering almost all the major questions I had about the movie.  Also included is a bewilderingly large assortment of trailers for other movies, including everything from \\"Zombieland\\" to \\"This Is It\\"!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I am new to the TrueBlood series, and when I watched the first season premiere over the New Years marathon, I just had to buy it.  I have watched it over and over....can't wait till season two gets released.
6304806434|5.0|Well what can I say...OMG...love this movie.  Nick cage is great as well as the rest of the ensemble.  Love the vegas scenes especially since i have now been there.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I have purchased this CD back in December and it is like a relief everytime that I hear it. I usually hear it after a long day of work and it always makes me feel so relaxed. I definetly recommend this CD. Susan Boyle is awesome.
0790729342|5.0|If you want car chases and spectacular action scenes, then the Road Warrior is it.  Set in a post-apocalyptic desert world, it's about a drifter (played by Mel Gibson) who comes across a besieged group of refugees who are surrounded by a gang of thugs intent on taking their prized possession.  And what is that?  A functioning oil rig.  The drama and fight scenes set a new standard for action and adventure movies.      Gibson's character must decide what to do.  Join them or go on his way?  He's a loner by nature, but can he survive alone out there?  This is one of the great films of the 1980s.  The sequel to Mad Max, it can stand by itself (you don't need to see Mad Max first to understand it).  This is the wildest ride on film.
B0026P3G12|5.0|What a joy it is to sit back and listen to beautiful tunes with lyrics that are sung clearly so they can be understood.  Susan Boyle allows all of us to dream her dream.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys LISTENING to nice music.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|I don't like chick flicks, so when this was in theaters I avoided it like the plague, but one day I caught a bit of it on cable and found it fun- light, silly, warm and wonderful. In short, a perfect holiday movie.<br /><br />In terms of a plot, there's not much there- two women find themselves flailing during the holidays and swap homes in hope of a bit of a change of scene and a break from the crazy. Jack Black is surprisingly honest and likable as Miles the composer. Kate Winslet is, in my opinion, a truly versatile actress who brings a light touch to her role as Iris- an Everygal with guy issues- who Winslet makes so charming and appealing you really wish you knew her in real life. Better yet, when she finally womans up you're rooting for her rather than rolling your eyes and saying \\"FINALLY!\\" Cameron Diaz is fun as always- once again proving that her comedic instincts are spot on. I think she worked well with Jude Law, who is just fantastic as Graham- sweet, sensitive and beguiling, and if you can resist those eyes you've got to be made of stone.<br /><br />There are a few bits that are a little too reminiscent of the talky 70's movies in which characters angst and moan about relationships and drek (there's a scene with Law and Diaz talking about their relationship in bed after sex that made me want to poke my eye out with a fork) but overall it's great fun. I plan on keeping it packed away with my Christmas stuff and bringing it out next Dec. 1 when I'm in need of a little rom com fun and Christmas cheer.
B000000WGL|5.0|This is one of my favorite driving CDs.  Open road, open window, music blasting. Guitar, vocals, lyrics are what you'd expect from Richards, a gift to the ear, raw and truthful.
B002IM49IW|5.0|In case you have never seen or even heard of a person called a \\"pinhead\\", they are strange looking folks from days gone by who were used in the circus sideshow acts back in the early 1900's. I believe they were slightly retarded or maybe just slow, but also odd looking, who patrons would pay money to see and talk to. In this movie they form a group and keep an eye out for each other and help each other when needed. Well, the leader of them who is a little person himself, falls in love with an average size women who leads him on into a marriage which is doomed. Once they get married she makes fun of him and puts him down every chance she gets. At one point she tries to get her new hubby so drunk he can't stand up, at which point the other take control. Very old B&W movie, and less than one hour long, but one movie that you will never forget. I saw it back in the 70's as a teen, and knew I had to own this true classic. Disturbing, strange, scary, but also touching and sad at the same time. I owned the VHS tape, and now the dvd, and if it ever comes out in another format I will buy that as well. It IS that odd and off the wall, but also can never be made again, as those people no longer exsist. One of my all time favorite movies, and one that will be your's as well. Gooble Gobble, one of us!
B000244EMO|1.0|It says 'Widescreen Collector's Edition) yet when I ordered it from a user it was fullscreen. Do NOT tell people it's widescreen when it's fullscreen! I was angry when I received this in the mail. The reason it gets it's star is because of how awesome Predator really is, I just wish I could watch it to it's full potential.
B002UZXJA6|3.0|I've followed Celtic Woman pretty much ever since I discovered them back in 2006. Although I wouldn't call myself a genuine fan of them, I do enjoy listening to the lovely music they produce.    \\"Fields of Gold\\"- a pretty cover though not Lisa's best solo performance    \\"Amazing Grace\\"- not a bad cover of the famous hymn, but I didn't like the use of the bagpipes    \\"Nil Se'n La\\"- one of the livelier pieces of the album, pretty much a G- rated re-do of the traditional drinking song. Very catchy tune    \\"My Lagan Love\\"- Lynn has a lovely voice, but this song sounds like a carbon copy of former member Meav's \\"Danny Boy\\"    \\"When You Believe\\"- I prefer Chloe's solo version, the one she did in her pre-Celtic Woman days    \\"The New Ground/ Isle of Hope, Isle of Tears\\"- this is one tearjerker of a song, powerful and memorable    \\"The Coast of Galicia\\"- Mairead and her fiddle produce a song with a Spanish flavor. The second upbeat song on the album.    \\" Non C'e Piu\\"- very lovely, stirring song    \\"The Moon's a Harsh Mistress\\"- probably, I think, one of Lisa's more emotional songs. It's odd, though, as on the DVD she hits those high notes with such power but on the CD it's like they turned her voice down a bit. Otherwise, a beautiful song.    \\"You'll Be in My Heart\\"- one of my absolute favorites from the album sung by new member Alex Sharpe. Absolutely beautiful and stirring.    \\"Goodnight, My Angel\\"- pretty but not really memorable to me    \\"Galway Bay\\"- pretty but also nothing really memorable    \\"Lost Rose Fantasia\\"- stirring Mairead solo    \\"O America\\"- not one of my favorite Celtic Woman songs, but it's their tribute to America      One of my problems with the album is that it's very slow and has little variety. I think this can partially be attributed to the departures of Meav and Orla, who both added a unique Irish flavor to the group with their renditions of traditional Irish tunes and for Orla's stunning covers for Clannad. \\"Nil Se'n La\\" and \\"Coast of Galicia\\" arethe only two lively songs, and everything else is just sort of slow or melancholy, all in the same general air. I did miss Meav, Orla, and Hayley's unique voices, though, and I believe Celtic Woman will never be the same without them.    Another problem is the removal of songs and apparent degradation of the two new members. Lynn's lovely \\"Carolina Rua\\" is not on here or on the deluxe version, and both she and Alex have only one solo apiece while the other three have two. It's a bit unfair to them, and I don't think the songs given to them really show off their unique vocal talents to set them apart from the other girls (Lynn almost seems like a fill-in for Meav while Alex is given simple pop songs when I hear she could sing much better than that).    The album itself isn't bad, but it's not Celtic Woman's best. There are some memorable, lovely songs here, but the general quality of the music has declined, much to my disappointment. They can do much better than this.
B001BNFR6W|1.0|I received the box set in a very timely manner and was impressed with the packaging.  However, that's when things began to go down hill.  We had been eager to watch our favorite episode of Will & Grace, so we put in the appropriate disk and tried to watch it.  It was the 4th or 5th episode on the disk.  It wouldn't play.  We tried it in 3 different DVD players with no luck.  I called Amazon, after finally tracking down a phone number [not easy to find].  The gladly sent out a replacement, which I received three days later.  We got the set put in the disk...  No luck.  Tried other disks.  None of the later episodes work on the disks worked in either set.  Christmas was not as fun for my wife...
1934429376|5.0|I waited so long for this book and was so thankful to see that it had been reduced both in size and price. This smaller version of the book is still quite large; in fact, I can't imagine it would be easily handled at the larger size.<br />Anyway, the book was well worth the wait. Todd Oldham has done a fantastic job of chronicling Charley Harper's career of beautiful work. A visual feast!
B000U1ZV3U|5.0|I HAVE WATCHED THIS MOVIE AT LEAST 5 TIMES.  IT JUST GETS BETTER!! IT IS VERY DRAMATIC, FUNNY, AND SOMETIMES SAD. KEVIN COSTNER AT HIS BEST!!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I love everything about the first season, and I can't believe that i got it at such a great price. Can't wait for the second season. If you're having doubts about buying it, well don't! I totally recommend purchasing this, you won't regret it.

9113020730|5.0|What a great three books.  I was quite taken with Salander.  Her character was very unique.  It was an interesting study of Sweden also.  I was saddened to have to finish the books and say goodbye to all the multi-faceted characters.
B00005LC1H|5.0|This item met my expectations. I love British comedy and want good quality so that it'll last for many years of enjoyment.
B0001MLMKY|5.0|Twenty-two years after graduating I've been reunited with an old friend.  I have a few expansive watches, but at the end of the day I can't wait to get those heavy things off my wrist.  I love this watch.  This is now my everday watch.  It's so light and comfortable that sometimes i forget to take it off when i get home.  It's a Swatch, you can't go wrong.
B000CPH9I4|4.0|I was only vaguely familar with The Coors from hearing a couple of their pop hits back in the days when the group was new, but I remember liking what I heard. I have loved Irish music since The Clancy Brothers put out records on the Tradition label in the late '50's. A few days ago I was hunting for bargains in a local music store, and found this item \\"used\\" for two bucks. For that price, it is a treasure. The disc features mostly vocals, well-sung, mostly in English, and the old songs are given a mild modern polish that enhances rather than detracts. This is very nice driving music, or something to put on in the background of your Scrabble game, for instance. Had I paid full retail for it, would I have been as impressed? Honestly, no...not for a cost of more than a dollar per tune for the dozen tracks. But if you like the Celtic music environment, these performers are top-notch, and this disc is done well in all respects. I recently attended a concert by a group called Celtic Crossroads...fine young instrumentalists and singers, who have been touring America for a couple of years. However, their lead vocalist's enunciation was poor, and her lyrics failed to come across in clarity to the large audience. You won't have that trouble with The Coors. If you find this at a price that suits YOUR budget, grab it.
B001PO53IO|4.0|So much better than the lame movie, and a gorgeous package to boot. Star wars by people who love star wars, actually resonates much more than most modern star wars output.
159448385X|5.0|Just finished reading this book, and couldn't wait to write a review. This is a beautifully written book that ties in history, multiple points of view, and drama. I will leave summaries of the book up to other reviewers. Suffice it to say, I found myself unexpectedly reading this book well into the wee hours of the morning. Although parts of it are depressing, I was left with an overall feeling of triumph for Mariam and Laila by the last page.     One of the best books I've read in a long time. Unforgettable characters. Makes me glad to have been born a female in America, and it gives a personal look into the plight of women and minorities in underdeveloped countries with unstable governments. I recommend buying the hardback and passing it on after you finish it.

B0008ENIAC|5.0|Excellent movie. love it everytime. I am so glad to have been able to place this in my classic movies collection as I have been wanting to get it for along time. Joan Crawford as always plays a fantastic part. And I her love for her daughter despite the fact she is horrible to her mother. As the saying goes \\"only a mother could love\\".  I highly recommend this movie and if you are seeing for the first time you will be glued. I was and still do. It is the kind of movie where you can't help but voice your opinion about whats going on while you are watching it.(Or that could just be me) I am sure any classic movie lover will enjoy this movie.
B002VPE1AW|2.0|Avatar is the Matrix meets Pocahontas on the planet Endor with a GI Joe Corporate bad guy. The movie is an incongruous mixture of other films. The Matrix, Star Wars, other films borrowed ideas (e.g. Apocalypto), and maybe even GI Joe and Pocahontas - were novel when introduced. Here they are replayed to cover a nonsensical and incoherent story line. I broke out laughing during the movie over how sadly predictable is the story. I however could not have predicted the regular needless profanity, occult environmentalism, and the hero \\"mating\\" with a female who is engaged to the future chief. The graphics are magnificent. The acting is formulaic and stereotypical. For adults this movie is a waste of time and for children lessons in bad behavior.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|PROS : lightweight         silent         does the job         the price is right         easy to install once you watch the youtube for installation instruction.         big and beautiful. Since it is lightweight, the possibility of bending your mobo is   nil.    CONS: Installation manual is a joke. Go to youtube for reference.           I was debating on v8 or hyper 212 plus. Upon looking at the v8 at our local frys, the thing is heavy and very big. Im afraid that it might ruin my mobo on the long run. Im glad that I choose hyper 212 plus, it does the job and a peace of mind
0061841935|4.0|Great book.  I am facinated by this guy and his book not only held my attention but was quite revealing about how he became the man he is today.
1401323820|4.0|Heat Wave is an excellent book based on the characters created by Andrew Marlowe in the TV show, \\"Castle\\".  It is purportedly written by Richard Castle using Detective Kate Beckett as his muse.  It is hysterical in that the dialogue is very similar to that used in the TV show.  Also, the \\"main characters\\" are Nikki Heat (a takeoff of Kate Beckett) and Jamison Rook (a takeoff on Castle himself).    It reads well as a murder mystery cop book. The only drawback is that the book is somewhat shorter than I'd prefer for this genre.
0375758992|5.0|This morning I finished reading what is now one of my favorite books of all time. The book is: DON'T LET'S GO TO THE DOGS TONIGHT: An African Childhood by Alexandra Fuller. When I picked it up and read the back cover it dawned on me that I'd first heard of this book a few years ago when it was reviewed in Oprah's O magazine. At the time it resonated with me because Ms. Fuller now lives outside of Jackson, Wyoming, one of my favorite places on earth. However this tells the story of her remarkable, hard-scrabble childhood in Africa. The back copy reads in part:<br /><br />\\"From 1972 to 1990, Alexandra Fuller grew up on several farms in the remotest regions of Africa. Three of her siblings died in childhood-only she and her sister Vanessa survived. While their father was away for long stretches fighting on the side of the white government in the Rhodesian civil war, their mother managed the farming work with a fierceness and passion fueled by a love of life, and an almost illogical love for Africa....A worthy heir to Isak Dinesen and Beryl Markham, Alexandra Fuller writes with brilliance, humor, and overwhelming affection for her African childhood.\\"
B00288KO76|5.0|If you're a fan of Dream Theater this album is a superb addition to their line up.  It's a masterpiece in their tradition of hard rock sounds written to a classical style of music theory.<br /><br />The music itself is outstanding, but add the fact that this is on high grade vinyl, and it just can't be beat.
B001676320|5.0|Wow! I've only recently gotten a blu-ray player so I wanted to buy a couple of less expensive blu-ray DVDs to try it out. I think I only paid $11 for this. Let me say that I got my money's worth after watching the first 15 minutes! Two great bands that band great together.     They start the show and end the show playing together. In the middle they each play a full set by themselves. I'd forgotten how many huge hits each band had.    When they play together imagine double horn sections, double drummers, guitars, vocals... it's an unbelievable sound and even with that many players it's not too busy. As a sound engineer I can tell you the audio mix is superb! That had to be one amazing mix in post-production.    The icing on the cake is watching EWF's bassist. He is an absolute joy to see. The guy is 58 years old and he's bouncing around like a 20-something aerobics instructor! He exudes total passion and joy.
0439882826|5.0|This book was a huge hit with my 4-year-old nephew who is an avid Star Wars fan. He spent hours looking at the book and every time found something new that he had missed. There is a lot of detail and the book really keeps kids engaged.

0061914177|5.0|Reading 4-6 books a month, to have my mind \\"electrified\\" and flooded with new possibilities has become a rare experience. This book re-introduced me to that feeling. While I've never heard Gary speak, his energy comes through loud and clear in his writing, and I can only imagine that his stage presence is just as charismatic.
B002ZG997C|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />On the whole, I have not been impressed with Denzel's body of work since he won his second Oscar for [[ASIN:B00005JKED Training Day (Snap Case)]], and this film does nothing to reverse that trend.<br /><br />In this, he plays a lone warrior wandering a post-apocalyptic wasteland, but unlike most other protagonists in films like this, he actually has a place to go and something to do. I won't say where he's going or why, but he's been doing it for over 30 years, which quite possibly makes him the hero with the worst sense of direction ever (has he ever heard of a map and compass?). But I digress.<br /><br />It starts interestingly enough, establishing his character in some ways you don't usually see. Of course he is a good fighter, as you have to be in a world like this, but then he unheroically leaves a couple of fellow wanderers to the untender mercies of some roaming bikers after dealing with a larger group of bandits. What, now he's afraid to fight? I suppose that, given his purpose, that can be excused, but that's still a bit hard to swallow.<br /><br />Anyway, he comes across a small town ruled by the iron fist of Gary Oldman, whose great power is that he can...read. That's not a typo, he can read, and that is apparently all the power he needs. We never once see him do anything that shows his evil nature, unless you count him raising his voice against a couple of women and pulling on the hair of a blind Jennifer Beals. Come on, this is Gary Oldman, the King of Psychotic Villains, and this is the best you can do with him?<br /><br />I could go on with other problems, such as there being no final showdown in the third act or Denzel's ability to survive a gut shot long after he should have been dead, but frankly I can't go any further. The more I type, the more I realize exactly how much this movie sucked and the less chance I have of forgetting that I saw it. About the only good thing about this movie the \\"sacred\\" item he had and a few neat twists at the end, but definitely not worth the price of admission.t the end, but definitely not worth the price of admission.
032147404X|5.0|I had to buy this for a digital photography course.  Scott Kelby is a great photographer and his photographs prove that.  Even I, as a long-standing amateur, picked up a few new tricks.<br /><br />I found his lame humor at the beginning of the book distracting, though.  Sure, he's a funny guy but anyone serious about learning all the tips of great photography may be annoyed at the wasted words. It wouldn't have hurt to have added a few more technical descriptions of how certain tricks work.<br /><br />What I really enjoyed were his special tips at the bottom of many pages.  Those were the ones framed and shaded in hues of green.  Another bonus was mentioning both Nikon and Canon features when there were differences between the two brands' terminology.  A few added Adobe Photoshop tricks also round out the information in this slim how-to book.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for someone who already has taken a few good photographs and who is familiar with her own camera.

B001AQO3WY|5.0|If your into the whole war, army kinda movies and mini-series, this is a very intertaining show.  Can't tell you how realistic it actually is, have never served, but has very graphic details.  If you get queasy with the sight of blood, this show is not for you.  Over all, provided hours of entertainment.
B002N8A14M|3.0|The armband is useless.  It kept slipping down my arm and it didn't matter whether I put it over my skin or a shirt.  Also, the case did not fit into the armband.  It just clipped onto the armband.  That said, I really like the case.  It is a tight fit over the Nano but once on it provides great protection.  I especially like the clip which I can clip on my belt, my pants pocket or mu shirt.
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|This is one of the very best Christmas DVDs that I've had the pleasure of listening to.  I became addicted to Andrea Bocelli and David Foster -- their music is most definitely \\"music to my ears!\\"  I not only listened to this DVD several times ... but even enjoyed it after the holidays, even in January of 2010.  I loved it so much that I bought several to give as gifts.  I also bought the CD and also gave those as gifts as well. With no reservation, I recommend highly ANY DVD and CD produced by David Foster and perfomed by Andrea Bocelli !!!   Hey, great music is great music and Andrea Bocelli and David Foster are the very best at what they do !!!
B001XJEKGC|2.0|I was very disappointed with this DVD.  It may have met all of the critical criteria as to sound quality but I wanted to hear Eric Clapton and this DVD is mostly Stevie Winwood. Would not buy again.
0316044695|1.0|A friend loaned me this book to read. He read it based on the premise; an operation gone wrong and one man left to tell the tale. He asked me to read it and let me me know what I thought. He revealed little of his opinion other than to share what the story was about. I found out after reading the book why he neglected to tell me more about it. It is one poorly written book. Others have certainly noted this, but I have to add just how tiresome the \\"voice\\" of the writer is; how it sounds like someone who is talking to you at a bar, going on and on about their exploits. And how you have to trudge through hundreds of pages before you even get to the event that the book is about. And how the loathsome \\"liberal media\\" somehow emerges as worse than the Taliban, indeed targeting them for blame for the events that unfolded. I could go on. I was struck by how the writer amplifies events for effect, i.e., he makes a perfunctory drive through Bahrain seem a scary, be on the lookout event, because of all those scary people there who don't like us. Having been to Bahrain on many occasions, walked unaccompanied, unarmed, through the streets at all hours, never feeling the least bit scared, I found this to be unbearable hyperbole. This helped ruin the book for me since it happened in the beginning, I found myself suspicious of everything else that came after. Unfortunately, since the writer is the only one who can tell the crucial part of this story, you only have his voice to go by. Upon completion of this book, I returned to my friend who asked my opinion. After I responded he laughed and said he had felt the same way. I certainly respect the heroics of all involved and there is a good story in here, but the person telling it comes off as so self aggrandizing and insufferable, that it ruins the whole affair. Finally, I agree with others who have stated that an editor might have helped.
0375413405|5.0|Ordered this while watching the movie and am enjoying the new challenges of cooking some different food.  A lot of butter and not so healthy all around, but it makes a great treat!
B0020MKTOS|4.0|This movie has lots of foul language, a lot of f-words, but if you can get past that it is an excellent movie.  Clint Eastwood still has it!
B002N1AF7W|5.0|I used to listen to this cassette in the early 1980s, mesmerized by this exciting new electronic, robotic sound.  The sound was disengaged yet beautiful.  When I graduated to cds in the late 1980s, I replaced many of my cassettes and LPs but failed to pick this up.  When I learned this was digitally remastered, I decided to get it.  The remastery is fantastic and the music still sounds so good, even after 30 years. The electronic/techno music genre owes much to these pioneers.
B002NPUCRQ|4.0|This CD is really good. I can't believe she wrote every song on this album. She is very talented.
1594488878|4.0|Within the first ten pages or so of Juliet, Naked, I was hearing lead character Duncan's lines in Hugh Grant's voice. This is no doubt partially because Grant has already starred in one movie based on a Hornby book (and  I have no doubt this one is headed for the screen as well). But it's also because Duncan is the role Hugh Grant plays in all his movies. You know the guy: immature, irresponsible and a bit selfish, but somehow you know he's a decent human being underneath it all, or at least you know you're supposed to see that. Of course, that's what most of Hornby's male leads are like too, with the added twist that they tend to be obsessed with rock music. Juliet, Naked is no exception, but so what?     The premise is basically the same as that of Hornby's classic High Fidelity, except that this time around the hero (or anti-hero, really) is only obsessed with one musician, and that one musician, Tucker Crowe, mysteriously walked away from his rather modest fame decades ago. Hornby definitely has a gift for portraying people who follow their favorite musicians obsessively. He fills in every last knowing detail of Duncan's obsession, from the amusing (the one and only concert of which there is no known recording) to the rather scary (his realization that he probably knows more about Crowe's career than Crowe himself does), not to mention his girlfriend's exasperation with the whole thing. What follows is everything Hornby does best: breakups, cartoonishly obsessive analysis of one's favorite songs, and some wildly unrealistic plot twists that are nevertheless enjoyable. Plausibility is beside the point. Would Tucker really remain hidden from the public eye for 20 years without even trying? Would Duncan and Annie have ever lasted that long as a couple in the first place? Why didn't Annie move to London years ago? Why does the almost cartoonishly American Tucker speak British English?     It doesn't matter. Hornby (or rather Tucker) says it best: \\"I'm not even Leonard Cohen, let alone Shakespeare.\\" As usual, it's good for a quick, fun read.
B001LMU182|1.0|The debate over which English dub rages on even still. Outside of the original Japanese voices, the Streamline VHS dub is by far the greatest. Not only because it was first and has nostalgic quality, but the actors were just plain better.<br />From what I gather, the BluRay release is the Pioneer (horrible) version. BUT it is sampled at the highest quality sound ANY BluRay has so far! But who cares, it's just TrueHD sound of a terrible dubbing job.<br />And what's worse is there is the THIRD English dub everyone overlooks! The Sony PSP had a UMD release of Akira that had an entirely NEW English dub that was REALLY good!<br />Why are two great dubs overlooked in favor of Pioneer's disaster of a job?! Because it is sampled higher? I hope there is a better reason.<br /><br />I still have my Streamilne VHS copy and I'll take that ANY day over this atrocity.<br /><br />And why couldn't we have ALL dubs as options?! It's a BluRay! It's not like we don't have the room! Make everyone happy!<br /><br />Until I get my Streamline dub, NO SALE!

B002SF9YUM|3.0|Javier Beltran's Lorca makes the entire movie... I couldn't tell what Pattinson was about - and perhaps that is what Dali was about. I think Pattinson was channeling Depp: at the start he was clearly doing Edward Scissorhands - and near the end it was a blend of Willie Wonka and Cap'n Jack Sparrow. But Lorca was beautiful and moving throughout.

B0011KQSZ4|3.0|I'm not sure what I would call DEATH AT A FUNERAL.  Comedy of errors?  Somewhat.  Screwball comedy?  A bit.  Dark comedy?  Certainly.  Drawing room comedy?  Part of it.  Farce?  Sure, why not?<br /><br />What do all of those things have in common?  Well, they're all supposed to be funny.<br /><br />So, is this movie funny?  Meh.  Humor is so subjective.  Why don't I tell you why it thinks it's funny, and you can decide for yourself if this is the kind of thing you might take to.<br /><br />Like many other films (and plays) of it's ilk, this movie tries to draw humor from a few tried and true sources.  First of all, it takes place in Britain, and it's a staple of many entertainments of this sort to take the starch out of the handful of indignant British elders gathered for what is normally a somber situation.  That, of course, is source #2; the irony of all the wacky inanity that happens around a (sometimes) closed coffin (one guy spends the entire funeral trying to score, a la Will Ferrel's character from [[ASIN:B000BKVQS4 Wedding Crashers]]).  You also have a great deal of scatological humor (most of it at the expense of a whiney hypochondriac) and a malcontented midget who is up to no good.  It's mildly amusing, although nothing to drop your monocle over.<br /><br />Part of what helps (and hurts) the film is that its cast is (at least to me) of relatively equal fame, and so they work quite well as an ensemble.  Unfortunately, it also means that (with one exception that I'll get to) there are no real standouts.  If you factor in the fairly tepid writing, you get a cast of characters that tend to blur into one another.  For instance, Daniel, the put-upon writer-wannabe who is in charge of the proceedings, clashes with his brother, Robert, a famous writer who is also irresponsible and vain.  Their conflict is engineered to keep them from devolving into caricatures of each other, which is exactly what happens when the conflict goes away 2/3rds of the way through the movie.  Daniel's wife, Jane, and Martha, the fiance of another guest (getting to him, getting to him), play the straight line to their troubled men and so they come across as being the exact same person (seriously -- their hair and clothing and even faces are almost identical).  The above mentioned hypochondriac fumbles and stumbles around with the same thinly disguised freneticism as another character: a hapless pharmacology student.<br /><br />Which brings me to Martha's fiance, Simon.  The pharmacology student happens to be toting some serious hallucinogens in a bottle labeled Valium and, of course, one of them ends up down Simon's throat.  Thus we have the wacky, unpredictable lunacy of Simon to contend with.  Played flawlessly by Alan Tudyk (Why doesn't this guy get more parts?  He's amazing!), this subplot effectively draws all the attention away from everything else that's supposed to be funny.  And although his story ends up being fairly predictable, it still steals enough of the show to make the rest of the movie feel achingly pedestrian.<br /><br />(Oh, and one more thing that bothered me: the title of the film?  Let's just say it's very, very misleading.)Martha, the fiance of another guest (getting to him, getting to him), play the straight line to their troubled men and so they come across as being the exact same person (seriously -- their hair and clothing and even faces are almost identical).

1423424514|5.0|The Real Book has been the definitive source and a pivot point for both aspiring jazz students and the careers of professionals for decades.     While some criticize the originators of the Real Book, accusing them of being copyright pirates, others like myself and every other jazz musician I've associated with over the past 35 years, herald them as anonymous pioneers.(let's not forget Robin Hood, Zorro, William Wallace, and other so called bandits who were heros in the eyes of the less fortunate).     The gods of copyright and licensing are necessary, however, regarding this matter, they have been the keeper of the keys (no pun intended), waging a half century vigil of attempting to force students to pay $$$ to play music, and thus restricting access to an art form to only those able to afford it.    Imagine, just how many jazz greats may have never been, having never been exposed as students to the inspiring pages of the Real Book!(I hesitate to list any names, lest it fill a hundred pages). And how many people may have never even heard this great music had it not been for the \\"original\\" authors of the Real Book.     I for one, and \\"one for all\\", thank those pirates of the pages for making accessible to both musician and listener alike, the art form known as Jazz!     In any event, buy this book! pass it on to your friends, family, and peers... it is a work of \\"art\\" and a true classic in its own right... I believe most of the composers, if alive, would approve.    P.S. Hat's off to Hal Leanord,,,? well maybe a tip a'the hat, but Carl Rothman in his review (when he mentioned illegal) neglected to mention that the majority of music found in the pages of the Original Real Book, is no longer eligible for copyright protection!     Fact:  Copyright protection is for 50 years and that's it! It's now 2010 and many of these compositions were published long before 1960, and thus are now public domain.     Anyway, thank you Hal for carrying on an established tradition for all, and Carl, sorry, but hat's off to the so called pirates!
B002IYEQR4|5.0|When I saw read Watchmen I thought it was an amazing graphic novel and I was longing to see the film. This version of Watchmen is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Now I live in Ireland and this version is not out over here but I risked it and it works perfectly in Region 2. All in all this is a brilliant movie and deserves to live on for generations.

B002KS1IJC|1.0|This is such a lame excuse for a Sci-Fi movie and it's not even entertaining. The plot is basically just Predator set in Viking times with a stupid semi-love story thrown in. What a waste! You'll notice a bunch of 2nd-rate actors that you've seen in other movies and they are all unable to breathe even the slightest bit of life into this movie. I should have done something else with the 2 hrs I wasted on this junk!

B002VECM4A|3.0|There can be no doubt or argument regarding the two lead performances in Precious. Gabourey Sidibe (Precious) and Mo'Nique as her mother( if you can call her that) really give it their all, and it is sometimes horrifying and mostly depressing to witness. For me, this was more of a character film than a film with a good plot. This film deals with incest, sexual abuse of the most horrifying kind, poverty, and lastly, what it means to have a dream. Precious has a dream, she has plenty in fact, but in her mind, she will always be the poor, obese girl from Harlem with the worst mother in history and pretty much a dead-end life. Already her life is massively screwed up. Pregnant by her own father for the second time, doing poorly in school and constantly abused at home, it seems she could sink no further. Her mother resents her (for reasons that will be revealed at the end of the film), and tells Precious flat-out that she should have aborted her. Precious seems to be used to this and she remains quiet and unassuming for alot of the movie.     Precious is given the opportunity to go to an alternative school where it seems, for a bit, that things can turn around for her. But reality always rears its ugly head sooner or later and her situation takes a nose-dive. I don't want to spoil anything or discuss the plot too much only to say that at times, I felt like I wasn't watching anything new. I don't want to diminish the great performances, but I'm pretty sure we've all seen films with people such as this, in situations and locations pretty similar. If you are going to watch this film, expect great performances, and don't be too dissapointed that the actual plot doesn't have anything fresh or new to offer.

B002VKE1K2|1.0|This movie was recommended to me by a friend and relative, so I bought it. They said it would scare me. What scared me was that they liked it and the only horror was the fact that I spent my hard earned money on it. I am a film-maker, a film collector and I studied film at Penn State, UCLA and here in Pittsburgh and my favorite genre is horror. This is not horror. It is a movie made by people with no creative talent but a real skill for marketing.
0823015017|5.0|I don't normally feel obligated to pile on when a book has so many five-star reviews, but I do this time.  +1 to everything everyone else loves about this book.<br /><br />And:  Thank GOODNESS it's not a \\"project\\" book!  This is an art form!  Can I have a few more exclamation points?  This medium is riddled, if not ruined, with step-by-step books that tell you exactly how to make work exactly like the work in the picture and leave you with no actual new skills or understanding.  That's not art (IMO).<br /><br />Wait wait, there's more:  Thank GOODNESS it's a \\"technical\\" book.  It's a \\"technical\\" medium!  It's chemistry (oops, was I not supposed to let anyone know that there's more chemistry to the \\"poly\\" than there is \\"clay\\" to the second part of the name?).  The stuff changes when it bakes.  There's a reason you're not supposed to let raw clay contact food prep surfaces...  Other artists get books about the technical elements of their media.  Why not polyclay?<br /><br />I saw this book at the store and let it sit.  One more over-promised polyclay book, flashy pictures on the front, boring step-by-steps inside.  Then it appeared in the library and I checked it out, and now I'm back to buy my own copy.  And I'm not even a polyclay artist!  I like the way the color information is presented and am working my way through the exercises in textiles--the information about color is THAT good and THAT accessible, compared to virtually every other color theory book available.<br /><br />Finally, it has been a while since I've looked at polyclay books, largely because so much of the content IS S-B-S, and it's good to see work of artists I haven't seen in every other compendium.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I guess I am unlike most of the people now days.  I have not bought a DVD in a long time because I don't like the direction music is going now days.  I like a nice clean song.  To be sung the way it was designed to be sung.  Not all over the place with glass shattering high notes.<br />I love her beautiful clean voice.  I hope she keeps it simple.  Not since Ann Murray have I loved a voice like Ms. Boyle's.<br />I think she is cute and full of personality that is real.  She is who she is.  Keep it real girl.  I hope ten years from now she will sing and be the same wonderful person.<br />I hear the critics wonder what we love about her?  It is simple, she keeps it simple.<br />The last two songs on the CD have some annoying back ground noise.  Her voice would be so much better without music in most cases.  I can only imagine what her voice would sound like with a church choir behind her-wonderful.<br />You feel her heart and sole in the music.  It isn't about, what is marketable.  It is stuff she likes to sing and you can tell (you can almost imagine her in the shower or standing before a mirror with a hair brush in her hand singing). I was playing the CD in the car with the windows down while I waited for my Husband.  People would stop and ask me who was signing.  They would stand and listen.<br />Wish more singers would go back to simple.  To many relying on skimpy outfits, high all over the place notes.  Finally someone for someone my age.  Oh wait I have the money to buy the DVD!  Maybe more producers need to remember that people my age have money and aren't afraid to spend it on music we like.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Coming from a person who has never used a workout video- this one is amazing. I absolutely love it! It isn't annoying or boring at all. Jillian is down-to-earth and explains each and every move. Before when doing workouts, I would worry about injuring my back. But she is so specific and touches on every issue that I know I am doing it correctly. This video works your arms, abs and overall physique. I use it everyday and each day I am sore and seeing changes so I know without a doubt it is working. The best part is the video is only 20 minutes! 20 minutes of great workouts that keep you going and before you realize it, the workout is over and you feel great! So yes, I would recommend this to anyone; experienced or not. FYI- the video is a little different in the fact that each time you turn it on you have to listen to a 5 min Jillian talk and there is no way to fast forward it. It stinks but I usually turn on the player and do other things before coming back to the video to workout. Just a heads up.

B0011DK2H6|5.0|This book should be in every library in the world. It is good to see that it is now available on the newest technology that has come out lately. This is a story that really deals with the humanity in us all. When we are faced with something different our reactions are not always notable. There is a battle in this book that starts at the beginning and weaves it's way through to the end. There are so many different aspects of the human nature in this book and it spells out just how cruel we all can be at times. The atmosphere in this book will stick with you for some time after you turn off the lights.<br /><br />Being out on the ice of the attic sea is not a place where you would think a story like this would start, but it leads right into the story better and sets the tone of the book right away. The tortured sole that was placed in the creation was surprising human and seemed to have more feel for the human condition then any other character in the book. The interactions of everyone in the book is true to how we act even in the modern times.<br /><br />The story is so known but there is nothing like reading it on a dark rainy afternoon.

B00275EGWY|5.0|Iraq is the location, war the condition, and bomb disposal the situation, especially when the bomb disposal unit is getting into its last four weeks of a tour of duty.  Already rocked by the loss of one their own, when Sgt James arrives, and turns out to be a  reckless excitement junkie, the conflict and tension within the unit escalates, as the life and death stakes grow ever higher.  Will someone crack, will someone die?<br /><br />It's simply one of the most tense and gripping movies you'll see in this or any year.  I recall, feeling the heat heat of the desert, and the tense feeling as if I was there about to be blown up, and I recall leaving the theater thinking would win the Oscar for Best Movie and Best Director.  Then in December Avatar appeared.<br /><br />A curious coincidence of these two movies is that James Cameron, Avatar and Titanic director was once married to Kathryn Bigelow director of Hurt Locker.  As the Oscar nominations are due to be made this week, the stage is set for a compelling David and Goliath showdown.  The two big nominations are Best Director, and Best Movie, but also Best Original Screenplay.<br /><br />Although I loved Avatar, I would love to see Hurt Locker pick up at least one of these awards.  The most likely would be Best Screenplay.  Certainly the awards would mean more for Hurt Locker and Bigelow than for Avatar and Cameron, which has now surpassed Titanic's world record Box Office. I am all for Hurt Locker, and Bigelow. Can we split it?<br /><br />Update. 2/2/2010.  Hurt Locker has won 50 awards already, garnering widespread appreciation. It has now been nominated for 9 Academy Awards, including the ones I mentioned, Best Director, Best Pictture, Best Original Screenplay, and also Best Cinematography, and Best Editing.  Avatar also got nominated for 9 Academy Awards, and Inglourious Beasterds for 8, rounding out the leaders of the pack.<br /><br />March 11, 2010. I was as surprised as anyone when Hurt Locker won for both Best Picture, and Best Director.  In so doing Kathryn Bigelow has become the first woman to win for Best Director. I am glad for Hurt Locker but somewhat shocked that it defeated Avatar for both awards. Hurt Locker also won for Best Original Screenplay.  I wonder if you found this helpful.g Kathryn Bigelow has become the first woman to win for Best Director. I am glad for Hurt Locker but somewhat shocked that it defeated Avatar for both awards.

B001NESPHC|5.0|Several weeks ago, I had never heard of Melody Gardot. Amazon's customers who bought this product also bought - led me here.<br /><br />Exploration reveals that  Melody Gardot was in a serious nearly fatal accident several years ago, when her bicycle was hit by a car.  She suffered brain damage, lost her short term memory, and for a while the use of her voice.  The doctor told her that musical therapy was one of the few things that would help restore her neural pathways.  Today she walks with a cane, and wears slightly darkened glasses because of lingering photosensitivity.<br /><br />I have to say this album is remarkable.  Not only is Melody a great singer, she has a very expressive voice, and the distinctive nature of this album is the mood.  Every note, every chord, every phrase goes to create a mood and an atmosphere.<br /><br />When you listen to this album you open a doorway to a new world of experience.  If you're like me you might imagine yourself down in the basement of a club, as you walk through the door there's a sultry singer on the stage, you see a flash of blond hair, you hear the subtle sounds of the bass, the brushing sounds of the drum, the slap of fingernail on nylon string, and you sit rooted to the spot as the melody washes over you, and the mood takes you wherever it takes you.  You have just entered the world of Melody Gardot.<br /><br />It's not as bright as daylight, nor as dark as darkness, it's a curious in between place, perhaps a reflection of the slightly polarised lens through which she views the world.  And the music is wonder inspiring, some of the songs sound like they are already standards, although she wrote all the songs except Over The Rainbow, to which she her unique rendition.  I have to give her 10 out of 10 for the songwriting.  It's rare these days to hear an artist who is also a good songwriter.  A particular favorite is Lover Undercover, and Les Etoiles, although all the songs are really good.<br /><br />The outstanding string arrangements on this album were done by Vince Mendoza.<br /><br />If you're like me, the songs are somewhat mysterious, and the more you listen to them, the more they grow on you. So, if you find yourself in the position I was in several weeks ago, go ahead- buy it.  I think you'll love it.<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful.one by Vince Mendoza.

B002KAO23E|1.0|I purchased this edition of Pride and Prejudice based on the assurance that the hard returns in the edition had been fixed.

0307269981|5.0|I know there are some people who feel this book isn't as good as good as the first, but I still think it's well worth it.<br /><br />It has one of those James Bond type openings that don't actually have a lot to do with the rest of the book, but it's still enjoyable.<br /><br />This is a lot more focused on Lisbeth Salander, which is a good thing. In the circles of my youth, a lesbian punk with a violent streak wouldn't have been considered that unusual, and I'm a bit surprised that she has such mainstream appeal. I guess times have changed.<br /><br />I'm not sure why Larsson felt this compulsion to focus on her domestic routines, and what she shopped for, etc. I would have edited that stuff out.<br /><br />The plot twist that takes place after the first third(?) of the book really was a shocker, and it defines the rest of the story. Safe to say that Lisbeth gets in quite a bit of trouble. For much of the time, she isn't even in the narrative, you just have other characters talking about her. It's fascinating how long Larsson is able to sustain this approach.<br /><br />To be honest, the secret behind the narrative is a bit more conventional than what one finds in \\"Dragon Tattoo.\\" It's worthwhile reading, but it's a bit more like the typical malfeasance-in-high-places that has been done equally well elsewhere. There are plenty of thriller action movies that have plots that are more sinister and conspiratorial. Unlike \\"Dragon,\\" when the mask is finally stripped and the characters reveal the true nature of their plotting and their fundamental nature, you're not shocked. It's more like tidying up. I wish that Larsson could have spent more time coming up with something a bit more earth-shaking and scary.<br /><br />However, the character of Lisbeth Salander makes up for these drawbacks. It's funny how you find yourself rooting for someone whom so many other characters in the book consider a dangerously unbalanced individual. It's definitely worth investing your time. Ten bucks for the hardcover is a screaming good deal. I'm glad that Larsson wrote these books, and I'm certainly going to read the third one. So obviously, he must have done something right.eal.

0061922315|5.0|\\"Secret Daughter\\" is a beautifully written book that brings to life the sights, sounds and smells of Mumbai, but more importantly, invites the reader into the heart and soul of the people.  The author explores attitudes towards motherhood, showing how they are shaped by parental and spousal relationships and expectations as well as the culture. She also shows that it is possible to go beyond the limits of social structures and the plans that others have for us.  Asha's experience with the women in the slum is a pivotal piece and one of the most revealing aspects of the story. This is a thought provoking study of marriage, cross cultural and inter generational connections and human potential for growth and creativity.  \\"Secret Daughter\\" highlights the importance of honestly naming our hopes, fears and desires to ourselves to ourselves as well as in conversation with the significant people in our lives.  An excellent choice for a book club and I look forward to more from Shilpi Gowda.
0307454541|5.0|I'm assuming this book has been reviewed to death, so I'll just give my personal observations. Anyone familiar with the news business will like the opening. At the time, I didn't realized that Larsson had been an investigative reporter -- but he obviously knew what he was talking about. But after that, the first part of the book dragged a bit, and there were some sections I would have edited out.<br /><br />However, the later sections more than make up for it. Once Larsson starts writing about the dysfunctional family that the protagonist is supposed to investigate, it becomes instantly interesting. And as the back story gets more and more sordid, the tale becomes increasingly riveting.<br /><br />Of course, a lot of the appeal is the unusual setting. The idea that a place with all these exotic names would have issues and problems so similar to America is what lends the story much of its charm.<br /><br />I actually bought my copy at a warehouse store -- this was something I gave as a Christmas gift, and the recipient absolutely raved about it. He's read a lot of mysteries, and he couldn't put this down.<br /><br />In short, for the Amazon price, this is one of the best bargains you'll ever get. I challenge you to find any competing product (movies, music) that will give you as much enjoyment for six bucks. Getting the sequel was a no-brainer.

0061876747|3.0|Climatologist Adam Kindred has just finished an interview at Imperial College. It went very well, and he knows it. As he walks alongside the Thames, almost heady with the success within his grasp, a taste for Italian food suddenly comes over him. Surely that can't be too hard to find. \\"He crosses the road, having no idea how his life is about to change in the next few hours --- massively, irrevocably --- no idea at all.\\"    The restaurant is excellent, and as he savors his scaloppine al vitello, he nods to a man seated nearby, also eating alone. They exchange polite greetings and a short, innocuous conversation ensues. But after the other man leaves, Adam realizes that he left behind a file. Fortunately, it has a name --- Dr. Philip Wang --- and an address on it. Did this fellow Wang do it on purpose? Could he maybe be trying to set up some lurid tryst? Adam pushes these thoughts aside and walks the file over to the address. And that's when everything goes horribly wrong.    Just when Adam thought he was about to celebrate a new, lucrative position, instead he finds himself running from the law. Panicked, he holes up for the night, thinking some sane resolution will occur to him shortly. By morning, there is a \\"wanted\\" notice in the newspaper, with an impressive reward for his capture. He actually considers turning himself in; he even goes to the police station. In the end, he loses his nerve and decides to lay low and wait for the cops to find the right man. In the meantime, however, he discovers that it's not just the police looking for him. He's caught between the proverbial rock and hard place, for if the police find him, he'll surely go to jail for a long time. But if the freelancer gets to him first, Adam will likely never make it to jail --- or anywhere else, for that matter.    In desperation, Adam tears open the file. If only he could understand what it is that he holds in his hands, maybe he'd be able to make sense of the situation. The only information that he finds useful is that Dr. Wang worked for a big pharmaceutical company, Calenture-Deutz. In fact, he seemed to be the head researcher in a very exciting battery of tests that may clear the way for a new wonder drug. The potential for enormous wealth is clear, and Adam knows how little value his life would have if he were to come between Calenture-Deutz and the promise of such unimaginably huge profits.    With a little over 118 pounds Sterling in his pocket, Adam becomes highly resourceful. He spends his money wisely, and finds a quiet place to tuck in and hide while the cops sort it all out. But the investigation doesn't go quite as he hoped, and the days stretch into weeks, and then into months. Adam follows where fate takes him, which leads him into grave danger.    Eventually, it becomes apparent to Adam that he must somehow intervene in Calenture-Deutz's plans, for they seem to be the key to the predicament he finds himself in. If he has any hope of regaining his old life, he must strike back and soon. Time is of the essence.    There's a lot going on in ORDINARY THUNDERSTORMS, some of it a bit far-fetched, but all of it entertaining to say the least. It's a clever new twist on an old scenario. You can't help but find yourself wondering, \\"What would I do if this were to happen to me?\\"       --- Reviewed by Kate Ayers

1439163855|5.0|this book was recommended to me by a friend.     All of the characters except one has his or her own voice which  makes the story understandable and keeps the suspense progressive because the reader wants to know how each character will react to the big event which seems to be inevitable----but maybe the big event turns out to be a huge surprise.  This story takes ambuiguity to a new level.

B002NALPCM|5.0|It took me a while to really appreciate this CD, but after giving it a few listens it really grows on you. In Reservoir, it quickly becomes obvious that Fanfarlo aren't just writing songs, but telling stories and divulging memories.    Musically, it's diverse and grand. Strings and horns feature prominently throughout a fairly pop/rock/folk base.    All in all an excellent CD, highly recommended. (I actually bought it as a download before official release for $1 USD, so good that I had to buy the CD from Amazon!)

B000069AUI|5.0|This is, in my opinion, the best album of the 00's. When I watched Aimee Mann perform \\"The Scientist\\" in concert a few years ago, simply introducing it as \\"a great song\\" I realized what impact \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\" has had on the musical landscape since it was released in 2002. Can you name another album from the past decade where other artists are already paying tribute to those tunes in concert?    When all the post-Gwenneth/Yoko effect on the band's career has subsided, \\"Rush\\" will have its rightful place in the discussion of truly legendary rock records. It's where U2 left off.. and where Echo and the Bunnymen should have gone... and even Coldplay haven't matched since.

I heard great things about the DVD though so I was intrigued.    It's broken up into 3 different levels and each level is broken up into a 3-2-1 system: 3 mins strength, 2 mins cardio, 1 min abs. Just when you're getting used to one exercise she switches it up with something new. Jillian doesn't allow any rest, she wants you to get the most out of your workout, which is under 30 minutes by the way. As a single mom of a 2 year old, that's all I have time for.    IT LIVES UP TO THE HYPE and i'll certainly be using it over and over again!

1423121708|4.0|If you know anything about Greek mythology, you'll know that their gods had a tendency to produce demigod kids by the dozen. So it's not too hard to guess what \\"The Lightning Thief\\" is about -- a boy who discovers that he's the offspring of a god, and the other demi-god kids that he gets to know at a very, very special camp. While the introduction is a bit rocky, Rick Riordan spins a clever fast-moving adventure that mines ancient mythology and gives it a modern spin.<br /><br />Percy Jackson has always been a troublemaker, but he's shocked when some truly strange things begin to happen in his life -- and especially when a minotaur appears and attacks his car. When he comes to, he learns that he's at a special training camp called Camp Half-Blood intended for demi-god children, and that his best friend Grover is actually a satyr bodyguard. Though Percy is understandably resistant to the idea, he soon makes friends in the sharp Annabeth and the bitter Luke (and enemies with the kids from Cabin Ares).<br /><br />Oh yes, and he finds that he's the son of the god Poseidon... which is a problem since the \\"Big Three\\" gods have sworn an oath not to father any more kids, due to a rather ominous prophecy.<br /><br />The problem is that Zeus and Poseidon are also having a feud at the moment, due to the loss of Zeus's master lightning bolt -- and Zeus believes that Percy is the culprit. And if things aren't patched up by the summer solstice, the forces of sky and sea will go to war. To save civilization -- and someone dear to him -- Percy must venture into the world of the dead...<br /><br />\\"The Lightning Thief\\" is all a little Harry Potter in concept -- ordinary kid discovers he has magical powers, and is taught in a specialized school/camp with other kids like him. Rick Riordan spends the first half of the book exploring the nature of Camp Half-blood and the various demi-god kids, as well as dropping hints about Percy's parentage. Although, given the number of times he makes water misbehave, you would think someone would have guessed.<br /><br />Fortunately the plot picks up about halfway through, when the whole matter of the bolt and thieving gods comes into play. Riordan has a snappy fast-moving style, and he peppers the story with plenty of plot twists and monstrous action. And he has quite a sharp-edged sense of humor -- the snarkiness is a bit annoying in the first chapter, but after that he produces some fun dialogue (\\"Spontaneous combustion is a form of harm.\\" \\"Nonsense. Boy wouldn't feel a thing\\").<br /><br />And he does a good job with the concept of gods and monster surviving over the center of the western world, as well as spoking some fun at the gods' behavior. Example: Dionysius whining \\"Father loves to punish me. The first time, Prohibition. Ghastly!\\"<br /><br />I found Percy rather annoying in the first couple chapters, but Riordan slowly evolves him from a rather bratty, rebellious kid to a reluctant budding hero. Annabeth is an excellent counterpart to Percy, smart and measured if rather haughty in attitude, while Grover is a likable little sidekick who is chewing his nails over the possibility of losing his job. And the supporting cast of gods and demigods is pretty well-drawn, especially the paternal Chiron and embittered Luke.<br /><br />This special edition is a pretty solid piece of work -- it comes with a cobalt-colored slipcase, deckle pages, a bookmark, and a general high-quality reworking. And there's also colorful John Rocco artwork included in this edition: the three Fates, the entrance to Mt. Olympus, Percy confronting an armored warrior, and so on. It suits the book.<br /><br />It's not brilliant, but \\"The Lightning Thief\\" is a solidly written fantasy/adventure yarn, which leaves the door open for more adventures from Perseus Jackson.

B001G9F9IW|5.0|I bought this movie solely for my future wife, Penelope Cruz.  And sure the other girl too.  However to my delightful surprise, this movie was beautiful, cleverly funny, musically charming, and very interesting characters. With scenes of Spain, I love the Spanish guitar that is played throughout the film. The film is quasi romantic, has slight suspense, and extremely clever.  If you're seeking a pure comedy movie, watch Zombieland; or a romantic comedy try Love Actually as this is neither. Having a hard time describing where this fits in and who would watch this movie; I suppose get it if you love the talented Penelope and 'ok' actress Scarlett, as they are one of most beautiful women in the world.  As for the HD vs DVD, I wasn't sure if I could tell the difference, but a few dollars more who wouldn't want to see these women in HD?

0307454541|5.0|The book starts off with Mikael Blomkvist's libel conviction.  He's humiliated because he allowed himself to be duped by the big time CEO he was investigating.  His career is ruined. He faces jail time and the financial magazine he's built up all these years in in bad financial shape.<br /><br />This leads to his getting hired by a elderly Swedish businessman wanting to research the mysterious disappearance of his niece - a mystery that's remained unsolved for four decades.  In the middle of this we find Lisbeth Salander, the tattooed girl that gives the book its title.  She's an investigation genius with some major hacking savvy who carries with her some totally inept social skills.  She ends up partnered up with Blomkvist to solve the mystery.<br /><br />Rarely have I been so impressed with a writer's creativity.  Stieg Larsson creates some really interested, believable and sometime bizarre characters and weaves together these complicated plots and subplots to keep you thinking at every page turn.  (I'm on my IPOD so no pages to turn, but you get the idea.)<br /><br />Just when you think you've figured it out, Larsson throws you another twist, then another, keeping me completely enthralled until I got to the very end.  It includes murder, rape, blatant fraud, some horribly dysfunctional and sick family members mixed in with the surprising antics of the tattooed girl.  Together they deliver some greatly appreciated suspense.<br /><br />The book is a translation of part one of a three part Swedish trilogy.  A good friend of mine recommended it and I worried with what might be lost in translation.  Well except that I don't know much about Swedish geography and all the consonant filled Swedish names, it was completely fulfilling.<br /><br />I've already downloaded part 2 of the trilogy from Audible\\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" and if it's nearly as good as the first one, I'll be downloading Part 3 \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" in May when the English translation is released.  (I may download that one to my Kindle instead.)<br /><br />This advice isn't the stuff you typically get from me and my [...] site, but I really loved the book.  Job hunting is top priority for the readers, but don't underestimate the importance of rest in one form or another for keeping your mind sharp.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|[[ASIN:B001FB4W0W True Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series)]]    This is an awesome show. And it was nice being able to not have to wait a week to see the next episode. Its a show about vampires trying to be accepted into society. There's \\"mainstreamers\\" which live among people. While the others still live amongst other vampires. I think its a really good show. And i'm glad i was able to get it on dvd. I couldn't really get it after it first came out because it was so expensive, but since i got it like a year late it came at a great cost :)
0743298020|3.0|I am an avid reader and usually get really wrapped up in the books I read. I had high hopes for this book, so I was disappointed when I wasn't immediately engaged. As I read on, I found that I did want to keep reading. I kept waiting for some kind of major plot twist or revelation. I guess you can say the plot twist came, but it was very disappointed. So much of the ending of this book just didn't make sense. A lot of loose ends were left, but not in the purposeful way a skillful writer might leave his or her readers thinking after the book ends. Instead, I felt like these plot holes were a result of the fact that much of what Setterfield tried to do with this book just didn't work. There were too many elements that didn't fit together, too many questions left unanswered.     So although I found some of the characters intriguing, and although I thought the book showed a lot of promise and potential, I was ultimately disappointed.
0385504225|1.0|The Lost Symbol was such a let-down.  The author combined so much scientific studies in the story, I felt he was trying to write a fiction/textbook.  However, I was neither entertained nor enlightened.  The story line doesn't really make sense to me, and I felt there was no closure (or I was in such a hurry to be done with the book that I somehow missed it?)  Robert Langdon was such a Mr. Negative through out the book that he totally annoyed me.  I do not recommend this book, especially for those who enjoyed The Da Vinci code as much as I did.
B001E45XT4|5.0|the headphones are comfortable around my ears , they don't hurt like some other headphones that squish your ears. they're pretty loud but of course that's when i turn the knob volume all they way up. the mic is good .
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|I had previously viewed this movie and loved it enough to buy it. I do not buy a lot of movies, but I love Abba music and the filming of this movie was so beautiful and the actors obviously had a ball making it. Pierce Bronsan trying to sing is a hoot. I feel good after watching Mamma Mia.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Just what I expected, the boys at it again, saving innocent people from all those things that go bump in the night. Its rather rare that a series gets better as it goes, but Supernatural certainly does.   The plots are unique, the acting sensational, great scenery and brilliant special effects...do not miss Sam and Dean saving us from all those demons.
B002VKE1K2|4.0|I am not believer in ghosts- or anything within the realm of the paranormal.  I am too much of a pragmatist to believe that there are lost souls out wreaking havoc on the living, terrorizing for the sake of terrorizing.  There's something, however, about a good ghost story that I just cannot pass up- the more realistic, the better.  This story definitely had me thinking throughout \\"wow, this feels so real...\\"     This movie works for a number of reasons- the most important of which is the first-person camera view.  I don't think that this could have been done any other way.  The very premise of this story is when Micah, the boyfriend, decides to document his new live-in girlfriend Katie's claims that she's been plagued by bizarre and unexplainable events throughout her life since she was a young girl.  Micah, a determined skeptic, sets up cameras in their bedroom and other locations throughout the house, hoping to capture or debunk his girlfriend's claims.  The use of time-lapse and pausing during significant events seemed to add to the palpable anticipation.  The very fact that the house itself is not haunted- but one of the occupants is- definitely added to the eerie twist.  Each time in my mind when I urged them to leave, I was reminded of that fact, which continued to compound the intensity of the story.    What also makes this film work is that it quite simply continues to work on your imagination.  It doesn't make use of any cheesy effects or spooky apparitions.  Scary sounds and unusual events occurring at various times had my heart racing and were well done.  From the deep trembling bass coming from within the house to the scenes when Katie would rise at night, standing next to the bed transfixed for hours, I kept thinking we have ourselves a good story.  The very setting- a normal tract home in the suburbs and not some spooky looking mansion- further strengthened the story's credibility.  The ending in the theatrical version is indeed very creepy, having you wondering what exactly was happening out of the view of the camera.    Few scenes within the story seemed overdone, but there are a couple worth noting.  One is when Micah is led to an open attic door in the house.  Upon investigating he discovers a photograph of a young Katie, lying on top of the attic's insulation, that was thought have burned up in a house fire many years prior.  While scary, it snapped me out for a moment from what was a great spooky nightmare with all of the trappings of a credible ghost story.  One of the few phenomena taking place during the day featured damage to a photograph of the couple, whereby most of the damage seemed to take place over Micah's part of the portrait.  Micah's exuberance and at times over-zealous determination were the few points against this movie.      This movie is worth watching.  You can see from the reviews already cast that you will either love it- or you will hate it.  It is a great low-budget flick with fairly good acting and overall a great storyline.  If you have any imagination, prepare to be scared.  I still think about this movie before I go to sleep at night.
B001QYHL42|5.0|This book was very well written and very entertaining.  It was also educational at the same time.  I totally enjoyed it and am hoping he writes more books like this one.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I bought the first season based simply on magazine reviews of the series... It DEFINITELY lives up to the hype.  Although it has a bit more soft porn in a couple of episodes than I was expecting, I enjoyed the series.  It is absolutely not something I would buy for anyone younger than 18, or easily offended.  Since I am neither of those things, I found the character development and the story line mesmerizing.  My sister and I spent some cold winter nights watching 2-3 hours of episodes at a time.  I even have the second season reserved to buy.
B000084HAJ|5.0|When I studied 17th Century Italian Art and Music in my Master's programme, the prof brought this DVD to class one evening. I had visited Venice and St. Mark's Basilica and as a musician, of course I was familiar with the Vespro Della Beata Vergine, 1610. Gardiner KNOWS this music, having studied it since he was a child, and the Basilica lends itself to the performance, both of the Monteverdi Choir and the children's choir, and also to the various soloists. Gardiner exploits the basilica in terms of both sight and sound. The choir is center front, but from time to time, they are moved into the galleries that abound in the church. The soloists move from the pulpit area, to different galleries to achieve the echo effects. All this time, the viewer is not only bathed in Monteverdi's splendid music, showing his effortless command of every possible Renaissance style, but the eyes are constantly viewing the inside of the marvelous building! Along with the performance is Gardiner's twenty-minute introduction to Venice, St. Mark's and the music of Monteverdi. There is no proof that the Vespro were ever performed at St. Mark's, but Gardiner makes a case. This is a beautiful, affordable DVD, and for me personally, it has become a souvenir of a summer in Italy!

1591842972|5.0|This was a mesmerizing read. It is one of a few books that I read and read again. I knew I little bit about Jobs and learned some VERY interesting things from this book. Let me be specific. First, the killer application for Apple 11 (VisiCalc) was new to me.The fact that this killer application caused the sales of Apple II to go from less than 1 million dollars in 1977 to 49 million in 1979 was fascinating.  I knew that the Ipod was selling well, but had no idea that by March 2009 it had sold 163 million, and that it was on track to sell over 300 million by the end of 2009.    His description of Apple opening retail stores in 2001 (and their subsequent success), after Gateways failure, was quite interesting.    I knew Rubenstein was important, but Kahney's description of his finding the 1.8 inch hard drive in Tokyo, and it's role in the Ipod was again fascinating.     I am aware that there are many biographies of Jobs, but I am VERY GLAD I bought this one.
B001U9BRNE|4.0|I purchased this Blu-ray before the holidays after seeing parts of the performance re-run on PBS. I highly recommend it. My friend noted that he doesn't actively listen to a lot of the star artists featured on this disc, but when put all together, it's fascinating.  Of course, if you're a Josh Groban or Michael Bubl&eacute; fan, I would consider this a must-have.<br /><br />* Performance<br />- This is show business. An excellent set list, with top-notch talent, and great interaction.  What sets this show apart is the storytelling and interaction between David Foster and the audience and David and these artists.  Michael Bubl&eacute; jokingly sings \\"Home\\" in a country accent, then Blake Sheldon surprises the audience by joining.  Josh Groban asks if he can take a moment to speak to the crowd.  Celine Dion stops her show to reminisce about David's influence on her career and to thank him. It's just a really well-done performance.  Pacing between up-tempo and slow tunes is great, as well.<br /><br />* Special Features<br />- First off, it's not HD.  It pains me to say so :)  If you're a video guy, you'll notice it at first then get past it, but for me it was a let down.  That said, the content is really great.  A lot of artists are interviewed about David's role in their career.  David is interviewed about the event and how big a task it is to schedule these stars to perform together on a couple nights due to the scope of their own careers. It's really a glimpse into all these relationships that David has with these artists. I was impressed.  I would have liked to see more rehearsal footage, though.<br /><br />* Video<br />- Very clear, 1080p video quality.  Lighting is good.  The colors on the stage really sizzle on my 54\\" Panasonic G-10 plasma.<br /><br />* Audio<br />- I'm currently only setup with 2.1 audio, but it sounds great.  The mix does seem to change volume from song to song.  Not sure if anyone else noticed that.  I found myself turning it up on calm parts and needing to turn it down on the huge orchestral parts.

Refugees must take a long and torturers rout Through Casa Blanca on their way to America; there \\"Everybody comes to Rick's.\\"  Rick's is a nightclub and a way station for a chance to get to America. Rick is played by Humphrey Bogart.<br /><br />Here we also stay for a while to watch a drama unfold. There are overlapping stories.

B001R60ESE|5.0|I purchased this Blu-ray from Amazon before the holidays and will confirm that it is of the highest quality. Perhaps the best review I can give is that my wife and I have watched it at least 6 times together and it has such good parts that we've shared it with friends when they are over for the evening. A lot of my friends are musicians, so the evening turns into \\"You have to see the drum solo on the last song,\\" or \\"There's a part where Josh Groban messes up Sting's lyrics during a duet with Sting in the bonus features!\\"<br /><br />* Performance<br />- My faves are Josh Groban, Sting, Steven Tyler, and in general, Chris Botti, his band, and the Boston Pops.  Wow.  So good.<br /><br />* Video quality<br />- Not only does it sound amazing, but as a musician, I really appreciate the long, detailed camera shots of Chris Botti's 4-piece band.  Drums, bass, guitar, and piano.  These players are not only technically fantastic, but they are so expressive when they perform.  It takes the show to a whole new level, and I much prefer it compared to David Foster's Blu-ray where the band is mostly darkened near the back of the stage.  Looks great on my 54\\" Panasonic G-10 Plasma. I'm using a PS3 to play the Blu-ray.<br /><br />* Audio<br />- I currently only have 2.1 audio, but the mix sounds good to my ears.  It certainly is quality enough to be made a live, audio-only CD album.
0547258305|4.0|Paige stevie  This book is one that you can not put down. In the beginning it already throws you into the action. The book is a fantasy, adventure, and romance. I really enjoyed reading this book and if you like fantasy then you probably would too.    This book is about a girl named Katsa who lives in the seven kingdoms. In the seven kingdoms some children are born with special gifts which are called gracelings. They are marked with two different eye colors. Gracelings are feared by most people because the Grace can either be harmless or harmful. Katsa has a killing grace. Ever since she was a child she could kill a grown man easily. Katsa lives with her uncle who is a king. He makes her do all of his work. If someone defies him he makes her torture and kill them.   Katsa is also part of a secret council that protects the seven kingdoms and brings justice to the people. The council will send Katsa on missions to help people. On one mission she had to rescue an old man kept prisoner. On this mission she meets Prince Po. Po is also a graceling, he is gifted with fighting skills, he can read people's thoughts when they are thinking about him, and he can tell when they are lying. Katsa finally meets her match when she meets Po. Soon a relationship forms between Po and katsa as they travel together solving mysteries.   After she has to rescue the prisoner she tries to solve the mystery as to why he was taken? This book has many mysteries in it that Katsa tries to solve. Another is a mystery that surrounds another of the kings of the seven kingdoms.    This book was a really good book I would recommend it to anyone who loves to read about fantasy and romance.

I enjoy watching them almost as much as being at the actual movie theaters. The sounds was Also clear and you get sucked in to the trilogy no matter how many times you have seen it already. You won't be diappointed with this buy.

031606792X|4.0|I don't normally write these, but I felt compelled due to the number of bad reviews given.     First off, ****************SPOILERS************************** and you guys are kinda rude for writing the reviews you did without warning of the many spoilers. Glad I had already read the book.    Okay let's address a few of the complaints people have with the book.  Bella getting what she wants constantly. Do you honestly think she hasn't been a spoiled brat since day 1? Honestly she doesn't deserve anything she has, but I'm glad it ended the way it did.    Lack of sex? Pregnancy? They needed to throw you for a loop there. And this wasn't the first time she thought about children. She thought about them in the 3rd book I believe. When she was picturing what a perfect life she could have with Jacob and a happy child.    And personally I think Twilight was the most horribly written out of all 4 books. It was a garbled mess of crap that Stephenie Meyer redeemed with New Moon and Eclipse. I'm glad at least the movie was good.    Either way, I thought this book was great. I loved that Bella wasn't the only one that got what she wanted in the very end. And I'm personally glad there wasn't a fight with the Volturi. You want her to leave it open to more books don't you??
B002SJIO5E|3.0|I saw this the other night and I would rate it as memorable.  It tells the story of an alien spaceship landing in Johannesburg, South Africa.  The film starts out in documentary style outlining the landing and how the government deals with the bizarre intrusion.  It slowly moves from the documentary style to a plot involving one of the aliens and a human.  Things I liked: 1. The aliens are hideous looking like something out of an Outer Limits episode. 2. The special effects are pretty good.  The hovering spaceship was pretty impressive looking.  3.  Though the film takes a serious tone, it lightly mixes in some humor which you cant tell is intentional or not.  What I didnt like was figuring out how the aliens and humans communicated with one another.    I have not seen too many movies about aliens landing on earth but this one definately distiguishes itself in the genre.  I dont know if there are alien beings or not in real life  but after watching some of the scenes of this movie, I think it accuratley portrays how the human race would react if such a landing ever took place in our lifetime or after.
1401323820|2.0|I found this book to be fun.  It reminded me of the TV series, Castle.  I kept seeing Kate Beckett in the role of Nikki Heat.
0446678430|5.0|I have read first four plus another four books in the RDPD family. I like all of them simply because they all communicate and emphasize the same message - create passive income by using leverages.<br /><br />But I consider \\"Retiring Young and Retiring Rich\\" as the very best among them, because it discusses in detail the internal aspect of making changes, namely mindset, beliefs, values, etc. (Robert K. used the term context/reality).<br /><br />The ideas within this volume are priceless!!!

B0012GVKW8|4.0|If you own this on standard DVD don't bother with the Blu-ray. The video quality \\"IS NOT IMPROVED\\", (AS WITH MOST OLDER MOVIES THAT ARE TRANSFERED TO Blu-ray).

B000VD5I94|3.0|If you already owns this on standard DVD then do yourself a favor and \\"SAVE YOUR MONEY\\" because the Blu-ray version is on the grainy side. I also find this to be true for most older movies that have been put on Blu-ray discs. It seems to be that only very recently made movies are worth getting on Blu-ray disc.
B002BJGYTY|5.0|I love that my purchase arrived in steller condition.  I was able to give this to my 19 year old daughter and it looked brand new.  Although she was aware that this has been repackaged, it made no difference to her and I was proud to give it because she requested it for Christmas and it appeared in perfect condition!
B000VDDWE2|3.0|First off let me upset a few people...GLOBAL WARMING IS NOT REAL! Now let me upset some others...CLIMATE CHANGE IS AND IS HAVING AN IMPACT ON OUR OCEANS. We need to be smart about how we impact the ocean and not really think an ICE AGE is coming. That is why this movie is silly but the visual effects are AMAZING. Is it just me or do the producers love to destroy the planet every chance they get(ID4)? The plot has holes, the acting is decent, the science is self serving, but the action and special effects make this a must see.<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: Amazing picture and thumping sound! Exactly how I expected it to look on Blu-ray. Not all spec features are carried over but there are some exclusive to blu-ray. FINAL VERDICT: UPGRADE WORTHY

It's a definite must see!

B0017KIBAI|5.0|I bought this to play Gamecube and Virtual Console games on the Wii.  It's a regular Gamecube controller and it's well constructed.  I particularly like the 10 foot cord.  I can play from the couch without having to move anything.  It's also a nice perk that it matches the white color of the Wii.  I'd recommend this to anyone who has a need for a Gamecube controller.  I'm glad Nintendo made this new version.
B001OW5O36|4.0|My three year old loves the entire Charlie and Lola series and this book is no different.  The pop-pages are beautiful and intricate and the story is delightful and sweet.  As an added bonus, I have taken Charlie's example when trying to get my daughter to eat her veggies and it really works!  The only issue is that the pop-ups are so intricate that it is difficult for my daughter to maneuver them herself- it is definitely a read-together book, otherwise you run the risk of the pages getting torn.

Spirited Away was the first movie we saw by him and quickly became one of many.  I am pretty stricked when it comes to age appropriate material, so I will add that I wouldn't show it to anyone under 10.  Most of his movies are for this age group.  Totoro, which is our families favorite, is fine for any age.
0307593525|4.0|I've had this set for about 5 weeks, and, no, I have not made all 500+ recipes.  It is a classic every serious cook should have in his/her kitchen.  While I am not much of a meat eater, the recipes around meat are superb.  On the other hand, I was not all that impressed with the suggestions on how to cook veggies.  I think they are too time-consuming and the results are lackluster at best.  If you want to remove all life from the vegetables follow the indicated cooking times.  If you like some color, texture, and taste you may want to cut the times in half or just follow your instinct and test for doneness.  I will certainly try a larger variety to see if this initial assessment holds true but for now, that is my impression.
0596007124|5.0|I purchased this book after reading some chapters of the Head First: Object Oriented Analysis and Design book.  I've always wanted to learn more about patterns.  I have one of the definitive books on patterns but it is had to grasp.  Although that books provides examples of the patterns with certain problems/solutions, it does a poor job of diagramming the thought process.  Head First does a great job of adding to the knowledge foundation to start thinking about why a pattern is necessary, and why it works.  I've already used two of the patterns as I was learning them.    The downside to this book is that it does not have as much coverage in the patterns.  Other books are needed to supplement it.  However, the knowledge retained is invaluable.
B002UJIY70|1.0|It's been a long time since I've fallen asleep during a movie. I think that I nodded off after about an hour of A Perfect Getaway. So 45 - 60 minutes into the movie here's what I remember:<br /><br />- Some very bad acting by actors that I really do like. Hey, love 'em or hate 'em, I like the [[ASIN:B000YPUFAQ Resident Evil]] movies and Mila Jovovich is cool. And Timothy Olyphant!...How can you go wrong with him in your film? But they were boring and unbelievable as far as I saw in this movie. And Steve Zahn has got a kind of tough look about him, so seeing him in A Perfect Getaway as a geeky hiker just didn't work; you might say he was...unbelievable, which leads perfectly into,<br /><br />- A story that was seemingly predictable, with people doing stuff that was just hard to swallow. So ultimately by the time I lost consciousness, the movie had introduced me to three couples: Mila and Zahn the hikers, another hiking couple that seems nice and a random couple that you don't trust. It turns out that there's a serial killer(s) on the loose and we're pointed in the direction that the killer may be near and may even be one of the couples.<br /><br />- An hour of the movie has gone by with not much more action than what is contained here in my review. And here are these three couples in a remote area of one of the Hawaiian Islands...When suddenly...I wake up to the main menu of the disk on my screen. Fell asleep, movie ended, credits rolled....Now that's what I call a sleeper.<br /><br />Do I need to give this another chance? Maybe I will once it comes out on cable, and maybe I'll return here and revise my review accordingly. But until then, I'd recommend a pass on A Perfect Getaway unless you need a prescription for something to help you sleep.

0792164903|5.0|Yes, this is clearly a somewhat toned-down horror flick but, WOW! I haven't seen much to compare with this outstanding film, in any movie genre, for ages. While it's much shorter and a different sort of story, I think that this production stands equal in quality to [[ASIN:B000654ZK0 The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)]], and that is a huge compliment.<br /><br />In fact, if you have previously enjoyed either [[ASIN:B0000797E7 The Hound of the Baskervilles]] (which is the \\"white-knuckle\\" version of the most famous of all Sherlock Holmes entries), or [[ASIN:6305609330 Sherlock Holmes - The Hound of the Baskervilles]], (the magnificent cinematography version), then you will clearly love \\"Sleepy Hollow.\\"<br /><br />THE STORY: This yarn springboards from Washington Irving's compelling tale of terror, the companion work to [[ASIN:B00221Q2TS Rip Van Winkle]] from this Classic American author's famous [[ASIN:0766184900 The Sketch Book]]. In the case of the film, a youthful and naive New York City constable (Ichabod Crane) is directed north to a New England Dutch settlement where a series of murders has begun to generate chaos in the community -- the year is 1799, only about twenty years after the American Revolution. The first nuance of the murders which Ichabod encounters is that all the killings have been effected by decapitation. The locals are sold on the idea that the perpetrator is nothing short of a terrifying headless horseman (artfully played by a deranged-looking Christopher Walken), purportedly a ghost of a Hessian soldier, but Ichabod is a man of science and he initially asserts that the headless horseman yarn is ludicrous. But Ichabod's scientific approach quickly gives way to his tormented imagination... especially when subsequent murders ensue.<br /><br />This is a terrifying mystery thriller of the First Water, directed by Tim Burton. The screenwriting (Kevin Yagher) is incredibly compelling, the cinematography is magnificent, the locations (mostly in England) are magical, the filmscore compositions (Danny Elfman) are faultlessly appropriate, and the acting is superb. Johnny Depp as Ichabod (at least for the purpose of this particular film version) amounted to flawless casting. I was also very pleased to see the great Christopher Lee ([[ASIN:B00009TB5G The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)]]), in this film however briefly it may have been.<br /><br />Viewers should prepare for a long sitting as the running time is 105 minutes -- but there is never any drag and the action is both tasteful (for the genre) and non-stop. The aspect ratio is 1.85:1, a presentation of enhanced widescreen (16:9).<br /><br />In summary, this Oscar-winning 1999 film is one that you won't want to pass by. I was not in the least surprised to discover that it was produced by the renowned and talented Francis Ford Coppola, ([[ASIN:B000286S38 Dementia 13]].) The film is rated R due to one mild and brief sexual scene as well as for the violence and the gore of the numerous heads which bounce wide-eyed along the ground after they are separated by sword and by axe from their terror-stricken hosts. I'm normally not a big fan of contemporary movies but, in this rare instance, I award \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" my most enthusiastic and very highest five-star recommendation.<br /><br />REVISION: (4/10) If you loved this film as much as I did you'll likely also enjoy [[ASIN:B00064LJVE The Village (Widescreen Vista Series)]].t, the locations (mostly in England) are magical, the filmscore compositions (Danny Elfman) are faultlessly appropriate, and the acting is superb.

B001FB4VZS|5.0|Having followed Smallville since season 1, this continues to tell a great story about Superman's life. This was not the best season by far, however it did introduce a lot of exciting new characters.  Without spoiling anything, I would recommend this season to all Superman lovers and comic geeks like me.
078322933X|5.0|The story is great and so is the acting. The cast were all chosen well and the director did a good job creating visually appealing scenes.
B00005OCMR|5.0|Great movie that changed how computer graphics was done back then. It is a must see movie. If you loved Kingdom Hearts 2 on the Playstation 2 and wanted to know more about Tron which was in the game, you owe yourself to get this DVD.
B002WSEQ0S|5.0|I love Supernatural and couldn't wait for Season 5 to come out on DVD so bought the episodes through Amazon Video on Demand. I like that Amazon keeps them for you and you have the option to download them to your computer or digital device. I don't like that I can't use them on my ipod though and are limited to the portable digital devices that I can use.<br /><br />This episode was great. We got to see Chuck the Propet and Becky the Superfan again, along with some horrible but hillarious Sam and Dean impressions. I don't want to give anything away to anyone who hasn't seen it, but it was definentley a good one.
B001PO53IO|5.0|My husband and 3 year old son and 7 year old daughter love this show!
0307593525|5.0|I have priced this set elsewhere and this is an excellent price for the set.
B0026P3G12|5.0|The cd arrived in only 4 days after I made the order. I gave it to my mom for Christmas, and she was delighted. The cd was still in the shrink wrap, in perfect condition, just as described.
B001GCUO16|5.0|Loved the movie and in Blu Ray always awsome.  Having a digital copy is great for my laptop.  Product was received in perfect condition and delivery was quick.
0452286751|5.0|Besides having a great plot and writing style, this novel challenge your mind and philosophy of life through the story of its characters, it contains so many quoatble lines of dialogue that I had the urge to use the headlighter in a lot of parts, it also has a very fast pacing: I could read 100 pages in one sitting without feeling tired, the only negative thing I could say about this book is how Rand handles the romatic relationships but that doesn't detract from the overall quality of this novel.
0312383320|5.0|I thought this book was a great, fast read. It had a lot of action and hilarious characters. The characters were my favorite part. I read another book by Janet and did not like it as much.
B000OT8GCQ|1.0|I always considered myself a fan of Nicholas Sparks.  I rank \\"The Notebook\\" and \\"A Walk to Remember\\" among my favorite books of all time.  \\"Dear John\\" has made the list of least favorite books.  Boring and predictable.  I only finished reading it because, well, I paid for it.  Don't be a fool like me... don't waste your money.  Don't think that because this book was made into a movie, that it must be good.  It's not.
B000FA5TTW|2.0|I am stunned that a) this book found a publisher and b) that someone paid for the film rights.  The overly long and tedious story line had me resolving to simply put it down several times but I kept thinking that the next chapter would make it all worthwhile.  I was so very sadly mistaken.  I can certainly understand how people who have suffered an unbearble loss of a loved one would be drawn to the concepts of heaven on which this plot seems to rely so heavily.  However, the concept is not enough to support a storyline overburned with one-dimensional characters. Even when they showed promise, Ms. Sebold lacked the skill to develop them.  The ending seemed to me to be a sophomoric attempt to simply tie up the loose ends. I suspect Ms. Sebold received confirmation that some fool was negotiating for film rights.  It shouldn't be surprising that a reading publich lacking both teeth & spines should find pablum such as this so easy to swallow.
B00008GKEG|5.0|The Beatles Anthology is a true and noteworthy piece of history. I can't believe that I've gone so long without seeing or owning it, but after receiving my DVD box set, I literally spent an entire weekend watching the entire thing. Probably I thought beforehand, as many would, that over the years we have seen and heard all there is to see and hear about The Beatles. Not even close! I was amazed at the footage and audio that was presented in this collection, which includes more than a few gems.<br /><br />Paul, George, and Ringo were all closely involved in the production of the anthology, as was George Martin (long time Beatles record producer). The anthology is presented as a historical journey, in chronological order. It begins pre-Beatles and shows each member as a child, discusses their family origins and early interests, etc. We get to 'see' Paul and John meet... watch as George (boyhood friend of Paul's) is introduced to John and joins them... and learn how they later met Ringo and how he took over the drums. There is some amazing audio and video presented for this time period, in addition to many still photos. Recordings of John and Paul pre-Beatles, early Beatles footage performing at The Cavern, etc.<br /><br />Throughout, we are led through the anthology by Paul, George, Ringo, and Mr. Martin, among others. George Martin plays a key role helping to guide us through this \\"Magical History Tour\\" and provides a wonderful perspective to recollections of the past. Others have mentioned details about the elements of the archive and the re-uniting of the (then) remaining three. What I found interesting was that various egos would ebb and flow as it went along, each Beatle often remembering events slightly different (but not contradictory) from the others. John is brought to us throughout via the many interviews, quotes, and films. As much as is possible for a project like this, personal agendas were set aside in order to tell a story that no one else is qualified to tell. I think that many years from now historians will be very pleased that this \\"in their own words\\" history of The Beatles was created.<br /><br />For even a casual Beatles fan, this is a tremendous anthology, and I recommend it very highly. Of course, now that I have purchased the DVD set, it will surely be released on Blu-ray! I only hope that when that happens even more material is included!to tell.

B002NWRMVS|5.0|After a so-so second album, I did not search out any subsequent albums, but after hearing a review of \\"The Fall\\" I purchased it and loved it. Her vocals are excellent as always and the music chosen complements her voice well.  The tunes are those I can listen to over and over.  I highly recommend this album.
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|This was a Christmas gift and I am always a little concerned it won't arrive on time when ordering on the internet.  As always with Amazon, I really shouldn't have worried at all. Delivery on Amazon items is always quick!!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Fantastic series. Watching it with my 11 year old daughter. Great learning experience. We also love the behind-the-scenes footage that shows the extraordinary effort that went into making this documentary.
B002C6A6F4|5.0|i took my grand daughter to see this at the show and had to buy it for her
B0001AUAU4|4.0|There is great clarity in this singer. Bruni knows exactly what she wants. And, as we know, she usually gets it.<br /><br />On the minus side, i could discern little progress in her musical or poetic evolution - the same throaty, self-consciously husky voice, the same cords, musical progressions & song structure, the same half-singing/speaking as in other French and English pieces from previous CDs suggest lack of artistic ambition. I imagine that Bruni unabashedly chooses the hedonic, the sensual and the lyrical/poetic over music itself. That her self-understanding is frozen in some kind of a stasis box. Unlike - say - Sinead O'Connor or Sheryl Crow - she never commits the totality of her inner resources to the song; there is always a distance, a veil between the singer and the song and therefore, between the song and the listener.<br /><br />Nonetheless.<br /><br />There are some catchy tunes on this CD, my personal favorite is Raphaël. And L'excessive. And, of course, \\"La plus belle du quartier\\"
0446569895|4.0|This book is a 4.5 in rating.  I expected more gossipy type content but his lifestory was very interesting.  I didn't think there was anyone who could out do MacKenzie Phillips in the drug department but I think Ozzy has!  Amazing he is alive.  What was sweet to read was his love affair with Sharon.  That is true devotion.  Started the book and didn't put it down until I finished.
B001QOGYFO|1.0|the plot is very \\"scooby-doo\\", and not in a good way the way Buffy used to do it...<br />Kate plays and American girl with a troubled past (flashbacks)<br />nothing stands out in this film...<br />except: how did they keep going outside in such temperatures without hoods!
B000L212HW|4.0|This movie isn't everyone's fave...thin plot (although, the acting stands up against how I remember it for the first time...in a theater...ouch!).  But it transferred super well to BluRay and there are far worse movies (don't get me started on AVP Requiem, Otis, or even Slumdog Millionaire).  Quality-wise, it's much better than Predator or Beetlejuice on BluRay.
B00001OH7U|3.0|Despite the unquestionable innovation and influence to popular rock music, even in his relative prime STS represents for me the artist at his non-essential, decidedly decent best.
B001EYGOEM|3.0|I love people that can write songs AND sing well.  I do enjoy listening to her songs, but she is very overrated in the Grammy department.  Live, she is so out of tune, it's scary.  Gals in my choir sing better.  I think she is mostly just a good songwriter, and very beautiful.  If it wasn't for auto tune, I don't think she would be where she is today.  She wouldn't make American Idol that's for sure.  But, I guess it's her turn, because Carrie took the honor many times, and so it's time for her (Carrie) to plateau, and enjoy starting a family once she is married.  I'm glad that the young girls and mothers like Taylor...that is a plus.
B00001OH7Y|2.0|2 1/2      Occasionally the self-absorbed experimentation does stick, but all too often, which usually is the case for one of rock's flamboyant showman, sounds contrived, pandering, and regimented.
0375842209|5.0|wonderful book. one of best i have read last year. thoughtful, creative, deceptively simple but very very profound and moving.   i loved it !
B0000E6I1J|5.0|Arranged by Jeff Lynn (ELO, Travelling Willburys) and Eric Clapton as a tribute to George one year after his passing, this is a live performance in Albert Hall in London with studio-quality accoustics and all songs are written by George Harrison with just a couple exceptions. Rent the dvd video also for even better experience!  My favorite is \\"I need you\\" performed by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.  Great album with a dream team of Harrison-era contemporaries performing!  Paul McCartney and Ringo were great but arguably upstaged by Billy Preston on the organ and lead vocal on \\"Isn't it a pity\\" and \\"My Sweet Lord.\\"
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I love true blood and I am so happy to own a copy of the first season on DVD.  The seller was amazing and this set is wonderful.  True blood is a spin off of a series of book writen by Charlaine Harris.  It is about vampires coming out of the coffin and letting the world know they are here.  The show is filled with wit, humor and adult content.  Even though this HBO series is not realy following the stories of Charlaine Harris, it is still fun to view  Enjoy
B002KGEORM|5.0|Family member talked about this show all the time. Found the season video on Amazon.com What a great Christmas gift this was. He loved it. Was so happy to have the season on Tape.
0446691437|5.0|I read this book all the way through in one sitting. Now I look forward to starting all over again--immediately.<br /><br />Mr. Pressfield delivers good and bad news for writers. The bad news: Our creative impulses will always meet palpable Resistance. We must learn to identify and do battle daily with Resistance in all its forms.<br /><br />The good news: Our Muse stands close by to aid. But Mr. Pressfield makes it clear she prefers to help those who help themselves. More drill sergeant than neurasthenic nymph, the Muse holds artists to a hard-line work ethic and doesn't suffer whiners.<br /><br />A former Marine, the author also believes in healthy discipline. \\"The Marine Corps teaches you how to be miserable,\\" he writes. \\"This is invaluable for an artist.\\"

B001FB4W0C|5.0|I really like this show.  The characters are great not to mention hot!  The dialog is just as high impact as the action and fight sequences.  The suspense is offset perfectly by the comedy and relationship between Dean and Sam.  Every season gets better and better. So watch all of them but don't skip around or you will be completely lost.

0140449337|5.0|If you expect this book to be anything but common sense and practical idioms you are mistaken. The genius is this common sense and practical knowledge is tested and elaborated on by the most powerful man on earth at that time and one of the most respected of his empire, a good judge of ethics and morals. Marcus Aurelius neither intended this to be a radical new treatise, or even published for that matter; instead these are the reiterations of a student of Stoicism, reinforcing his willpower in face of his self-acknowledged weaknesses, and in that regard an intriguing, intimate look into one of the few \\"philospher kings\\" of Plato's dreaming.    His philosophy, sometimes rambling, often redundant, and idiosyncratic (repetition of the theme of afterlife), is nothing new to anyone who has studied Stoicism. For those unfamiliar, it reads easily and has a non-academic feel without sinking to a \\"dear diary\\" sappiness. These are real-life politics and wars he is describing, and he's the one responsible for pulling the empire through it. The brief maxims and longer diatribes are not profession in nature or necessarily inspiring, but are timeless all the same, and like the Ecclesiastes and the Upanishads, a practical code to follow. A book I will likely come back to again and again.

The control gives me a much improved feel for the games I play. Before, I had to watch a gage of how my power, heatlh scale or the like and keep my eye on the games at the same time. Now the controller let me know with a vibrating shock and I can keep eye out on where the damage is coming from. My play has improved greatly because of this. I recommend the unit 100 %..
0385523904|4.0|Barbara Demick's Nothing to Envy is probably the best account, for the layman, of the last two decades in North Korea. Demick has used her time as the bureau chief of the Los Angeles Times' Seoul desk to gradually gather enough sources to paint a portrait of the hermit nation. This book is the story of a few people from Chonjin. None are members of the Worker's Party, and each is now a defector. They include a shy scholar, a doctor, a teacher, a young woman from a family with Japanese blood, an older woman with a lot of community pride, a young man who learns to steal food in spite of his proud father's scorn. The title refers to the refrain of a patriotic song. \\"We have nothing to envy..\\" It is a phrase that lends itself to irony.<br /><br />If I am honest with myself, I have to recognize the paradox posed by reading a book about North Korea. There is no doubt that the people of this nation are in peril. It deserves our concern. It begs for some kind of conversation. What can be done? It would demand that we understand why our existing political remedies fail to make a difference. Yet reading, by itself, falls short of action. If concern is the only response, then what does that mean? I am reflecting on my own culpability. I am a better reader when I am also entertained. I am concerned about NK, but I didn't pick up any of the human rights reports on this subject. It is much like the beautiful photography by Sebastiao Salgado of famine in the Sudan. We readily consume glorious reportage of tragic suffering.<br /><br />A recurring theme is that survivors live only when they learn to put their interests ahead of anyone else. The young man lives, while his father starves to death in a train station. The schoolteacher watches her pupils starve, but she is not foolish. She doesn't share her meager rations with her students. When people have to work all day to put together 500 calories a day, there is little room to offer kindness to strangers.<br /><br />The book has three parts in my mind.  The first section attempts to offer some degree of sympathy for the country. She mentions that even if there is no electricity at night in much of the country, that means walks at night are uncluttered.  The sky is lit up by stars. There is very little pollution. True....I suppose.<br /><br />The next section goes into the grisly bits that underscore the larger truth: this is a horrible place to live.  The people are living under a slow emergency. The country's leaders have given up any pretense that society is functioning. People spend their days scavenging for food. The eat tree bark, or sticks, or grass. The hospitals don't have electricity, let alone medicine. A character in this story acknowledges the truth - the country has become one large prison. Its citizens are hostage to the failed philosophies of its leadership. When the government admits that there is widespread homelessness in their paradise, they establish a series of community structures. Those structures turn out to be small jails.<br /><br />In the last chapter, Demick departs from strict reportage and moves into some reflection with a fair bit of speculation. She reverts to using symbolic imagery. Swallows, for example, are the young children cast off from their families that learn to survive by stealing bits of food from the illegal black market farmer's markets. The economy's lack of energy can even be seen in how people stand. It is not unusual, she says, to see a large group of people setting on their haunches for hours at a time. They are conserving their energy.  Besides, they don't have anything else to do.<br /><br />I didn't understand that the implosion of this economy was predicated by the end of a ready supply of oil. North Korea could no longer look to allies in the Communist World with fuel (Soviet Union), because after 1989, they weren't there. North Korea had developed into an industrial nation. In Chonjin, where these subjects in this book are all from, hugemines and factories are silenced without oil. Even the coal mines, which should provide a ready supply of energy, won't produce without the oil needed to power the earth moving machines. This contributes to a lack of food, because most fertilizers require oil. Farming requires fuel to run machines.<br /><br />Demick's book avoids layering the reporting with too much opinion. She lets the facts speak for themselves. Some of the details in this book are fascinating. For example, she explains why North Korean clothing has such a distinctly colorless look. It turns out that this is not an accident or a poor electronic reproduction. It is vinalon, a textile invented in North Korea that is made from a mixture of coal, limestone, and vinyl. It is often called Juche Fiber. Vinalon dies won't hold color, so it tends to be dark. Another oddity is the tradition of giving candy to children on the birthdays of Kim Jong-Il and Kim il-Sung. The rest of the year,they starve like everyone else. The Party uses the candy in conjunction with its other propaganda: Each home has pictures of the two leaders. The pictures are required to be displayed in every families, and they are inspected for cleanliness. It is front of those pictures that the children are given their candy. The association between their leaders and great benevolence is thus constructed. Details like these don't need any additional persuasion to make the main point.<br /><br />Going back to my own ethical quandary, I am left even more uncertain about what the West can do to resolve this situation. North Korea's leadership uses our overtures of aid to generate aid donations. That food is not making its way to the people. The government uses what fertility is left in the soil to grow poppies for heroin. North Korea is supposed to be a producer of methamphetamine as well. It would be hard to imagine a country more deserving of regime change. Our aid programs seem to only delay the inevitable.  Each day only serves to push more people into starvation.<br /><br />Not everyone wants to know about a place like North Korea. I do, but I'll admit that I could find very few people who wanted to hear about the details that are within this book. I don't think that there are many better alternatives than this book. There is a famous documentary from the BBC, a series of academic journal publications, and the reports from human rights observers. Those have their own strength, but none can match this book for its ability to put this crisis into the context of the lives of North Korea's common citizens.oil.

B002VECM72|5.0|I loved this film. I welled up more than once, choked up a few times and laughed a lot; great big guffaws. Sandra Bullock (for me) has been amazing since SPEED. I'm thrilled she's finally getting the recognition she deserves; but she is especially wonderful in this film, like she's hitting her stride. Everyone in this film is fabulous. Everyone. The story is so moving and inspiring. Amazing script/directing job by John Lee Hancock, (who directed another movie I love, THE ROOKIE, with Dennis Quaid.) Bravo to all. Bravissimo.
B001FB4VZS|4.0|I have all the Smallvile Seasons on DVD and this is one of my favorite seasons.  It tells more of the story in a somewhat Darker light to get a more mature Superman to emerge as the hero we all love.  If you love the other seasons you will love this season as well.
B003204MQS|4.0|My general opinion of the movie itself is, anyone going into this thinking they will be seeing \\"the scariest movie ever\\" is sadly mistaken.  I have made scarier home-movies when I was younger, filming my father snoring...    That being said however, my opinion of the characters and their plight is something different.  I tend to place myself into a situation when reading or watching a movie, instead of just standing back as an observer, and when doing this, I found that it kept my attention, and that there were a few parts that made me jump despite having expected them.      I would not watch it over or over, but it will be a fun movie to watch on Halloween, for sure.
B001992NUQ|1.0|I have never once had a problem on Amazon.  I ordered this Blu-Ray to find out it was a DVD not a Blu-Ray.  The case was a Blu-Ray case, but the disc itself was not.  Make sure to check your disc, because mine was completely sealed, but somehow was switched.  I had gotten this for a gift for a friend and they already have it, so i kept it.  I already have the DVD but kept it anyways believing it was a Blu-Ray.  I opened it now over a month later and I am furious.  I can't send it back now because it is too late correct?  Someone please let me know.  Thanks.
0316066524|5.0|How can I review this book? This is like nothing else I've ever read--I hope this is only because I'm not well-read, because the idea that I never will read anything else like this is a very sad idea. Who else could write in excess of 1100 pages in which very little ever actually happens and have it be completely irresistible?    Wallace's voice and personality in this book are inimitable. The book, for this reason, is undeniably funny, because DFW is funny, but I can't help but think that the reviews that call it things like a \\"screwball comedy\\" are completely missing the point. The book, to me, is almost indescribably sad.    The question \\"is it really possible to know another person's heart\\" is so trite that I pretty much won't read any book whose review or blurb contains it--but this is what this book asks, and it asks it better than anything else whose author seems to have set out to write a book asking it, and the humor with which it asks it only makes the question itself more heartbreaking. Actually, this isn't really the question at all; the question is a lot better than this--how do people communicate with each other at all, what masks do they hide themselves behind and how do the choices they make and the things they give themselves away to cut them off from each other--and of course the book does all this infinitely better than I can do it here.    This is probably the aspect of the book (the professional conversationalist bit, the wraiths, &c.--although this is not a book that is easily broken down into \\"this bit pertains to this theme and that bit to that\\", and it recurs in many guises) that resonates with me the most--but there is so much more. Read it yourself to see what of its questions resonates with you. Something will.    It may be mostly a question of personality, whether or not DFW's decidedly-idiosyncratic style appeals to you--but if it does there is nothing like it. Read it. Then read it again. I loved this book, obviously, the first time through, mourned when it ended (after 1100 pages!); I'm now about a quarter of a way through the second time, and it's almost like reading a different book. Scenes that were pretty interesting, kind of funny and faintly bewildering the first time are downright rich on the second reading, taking on such new importance that a book that was incredibly powerful on the first reading is now somehow knitting itself together into something even more cohesive. Amazing.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|First make sure your case is at least 8.25\\" wide(outside dimension)I guess most modern cases are, I have some older cases which are not.Second this is most easily an install if it's a new MB setup, otherwise you will have to completely remove MB.Third make sure you read, understand the instructions, and take your time during install. Fourth once installed it is a quiet and efficient cooler with one of the best prices I've seen. My setup Asus MN482 Deluxe, AMD AM3 Phenom II X2 550 BE(no this MB will not unlock CPU cores but other MBs can)GSkill DDR2 800 4gb, BFG 9800 GTX+, WD 500GB Blue, Samsung SH-223, PCP&C 610w PSU all in a Lian Li PC-65 case. Standard setup no overclocking though Asus MB provides a wealth of easy options to do so.Back to the cooler, keeps CPU temp 41C-42C range, has optional install for a 2nd 120mm x 25mm fan. It's orientation in case is that fan brings air in from bottom, blows across cooler toward top where that flow is picked up by PSU fan and expelled. So I recommend this cooler for quietness, efficiency, price, and the universal install kit included.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|The whole family loved this movie!! On bluray it's even better! Everyone should have this...Enjoy!    By the way, I love Amazon, I think the best way to but just about everything is to go Amazon!!
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|Disney has done it once again. I absolutely love this movie. The characters, the atmosphere, and the music were just fantastic. My heart has always been fond of \\"The Little Mermaid\\" and \\"Aladdin\\", but now I have room for \\"The Princess and The Frog. Bravo Disney for making another classic that will be enjoyed for many years to come. I will definitely pre-order this movie and add it to my blu-ray collection.
B000063DFS|4.0|Hadn't heard this for years, just found an old cassette and really dug cranking it in the car on a long trip. What stands out most for me is Zakk's high-energy playing, specifically his extensive use of pinch harmonics. Sometimes they're a pointless effect in metal, but Wylde makes them part of some of the best riffs here and it works well.<br /><br />The other highlight is the drumming by Castillo, who explodes at times and is very entertaining and on top of it, but knows when to lay back in the pocket a bit, not too easy for most metal drummers.<br /><br />Ozzy's voice has been better, but the outside writers provided some good semi-pop metal tunes that work well, like Mama and Road. I also love some of Oz's lyrics here, rather funny in fact, especially the bits about Jimmy Swaggart. Oz rarely gets credit for his occasionally surprisingly intelligent lyrics, such as War Pigs; they help lift him above the metal rabble. Add Wylde's energy and Castillo's propulsion and this one rocks party the way it was designed to.
B0026P3G12|3.0|The album has a couple of outstanding tracks, including the title track, but otherwise does not distinguish itself as an album of high quality. While I'm glad I bought it, and while it makes an appreciated gift, listening to the entire album at a sitting leaves me bored with the sameness of voice and sound.
B002T9H2ME|4.0|I love the basic idea here (won't spoil it with details), but by the time it was revealed and started to flower, we were rather bored. It then got very interesting and thought-provoking, however, so if you can wait for about 45 minutes there is a fine payoff. If it had been revealed early on and then played out with more time, I think this would be a truly classic film.<br /><br />Rockwell certainly is good here, though of course I can't really detail that comment without spoliers!<br /><br />I was overly reminded of 2001 and Blade Runner a little too often, especially the latter towards the end here. But, those are fine progenitors to have, so fair enough. The director is to be complimented for such a fine job on a pretty small budget, in any case, and for getting a great performance from Sam.<br /><br />In short, if you like character peices and/or sci-fi, this is well worth checking out.<br /><br />The blu-ray is excellent, btw, with a nice transfer and a bunch of good extras, including two commentaries, a few little docs, and a rather good short film by Jones, quite decent in its own right, with some very fine footage of Swiss locales and an interesting plot.<br /><br />All in all, a nice little package for a unique film.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|We already had the DVD but bought it again when it came out on Blu-Ray. Absolutely stunning. Buy it!!
B001AQT11M|5.0|I love all Disney movies, and even though I am now a Grandmother, I still love them and am grateful that we are able to purchase them in DVDs.  I always thought the term \\"Imagineers\\" (what Walt Disney called them) was perfect, as that is what these wonderful people who think up the stories and the artists who bring them to life, certainly are.  It is a wonderful gift -- imagination -- and if used to lift thought to a brighter and more innocent sense of life, and to give joy, then that's a real accomplishment!  Snow White being one of the very early ones, if not the first one (don't remember) is certainly one of my favourites, and I am slowly collecting them as they become available.  You can be sure my Grandchildren are enjoying them, for which I am grateful considering the type of \\"entertainment\\" being produced for children today!!  Virginia Houston

B00288KNJU|5.0|Watching CORALINE, I was enthralled and puzzled. \\"Exactly what audience is this type of animated feature shooting for?\\" I asked myself. And it's not an easily answered one. On the surface, Coraline is an children's adventure story; the story of a little girl exploring her surroundings and finding a kind of Tim Burton-esque rabbit hole leading to an alternate reality. But dig just a bit deeper and you hit a rather frightening layer closer to the truth behind what might be perceived as a kind of heaven and hell. But which is heaven and which is hell? These are the questions that linger throughout the film...<br /><br />Coraline's transplantation into a new home leads her to explore its surroundings. First bumping into Wybie (Robert Bailey Jr., [[ASIN:B001DZOC3W The Happening]]) she learns that their new house has a history. Death has lurked not far away and looking at the landscape one quickly gets a sense of foreboding. A black cat (voiced by Keith David, [[ASIN:B000EWBKLW Crash]]) adds to this sense.<br /><br />Coraline's parents Mel (Teri Hatcher, [[ASIN:B000MTFFO0 The Dead Girl]]) and Charlie (John Hodgman) don't have much time for Coraline, as they are trying to meet a literary deadline. So Coraline is left to her own devices and soon discovers a doorway to a much happier, alternate reality. Trouble is everyone there has buttons for eyes. But why?<br /><br />The reality is rather frightening and ghostly. So this isn't something young kids are going to enjoy nor understand. But it does have appeal. And, dare I say, it has appeal on a more intellectual level, even though much of the story can be dissected rather easily. But what parts aren't can, and will, linger in your mind for some time.<br /><br />This isn't [[ASIN:B001EOQWF8 Wall-E]] or some other cutesy Disney film. This is raw, unforgiving storytelling within a stop-motion animated feature with a clever design and nightmarish qualities. Think of it more along the lines of [[ASIN:B001AIRUP4 The Nightmare Before Christmas]] and you'll be closer, but not quite there.<br /><br />The dangers to Coraline seem real, not just physically but spiritually. And when you see Coraline's Other Mother and Father on the downside of the rabbit hole, you get a knot in the pit of your stomach that tells you everything may not turn out well for our heroine or her family and friends.<br /><br />The voice actors all do an admirable job with special nods to Teri Hatcher as both Mel and the Other Mother. Her digression into this dangerous character were well played. And a big thumbs up to Keith David as The Cat. His voice was PERFECT and you really can't tell who's side he's on ...if any.<br /><br />This is something to watch and ponder. But not with the kiddies. This is a thought-provoking animated film for adults and teens.loser, but not quite there.     The dangers to Coraline seem real, not just physically but spiritually.

B001JNNDGA|2.0|This movie was mostly focused on the persecution of Jesus Christ. While this was probably all it was supposed to be, I was expecting the life of Jesus as told in the Bible with all the \\"miracles\\" included and him spreading messages. Not at all what I expected.
B0010X745K|5.0|I loved this movie!  After his yawner \\"Rose Red\\", I wasn't expecting much and was pleasantly surprised.  Marcia Gay Hayden did a great job playing the crazy christian nutter.  Politics, giant insects, tribalism, and the dangers of religion... It's all in this movie!

B00000IQCA|5.0|The Master Robert Altman created this piece before Gosford Park but even back then he used his same techniques. It conquers those guilty instincts many of us have to know what is going on in peoples lives. Among a cast of actors like Sophia Loren, Julia Roberts, Rupert Evert, there the real stars of the Paris Fashion scene Terry Mueller, Jon Paul Gautie, La Criox, Vivian Westwood,and the Press. Sit back and watch it all unfold.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|Wow, they've done it again....outstanding story and acting and special effects, etc. etc.  DVD arrived when promised and in good condition. I'm an old 'Trekkie' and wasnpt sure I'd like it, but the whole family did.
B002UZ3M8U|4.0|I checked this album out on a whim, because Amazon.com recommended it and I was pretty starved for good, new music.  What a great blind buy!  I haven't taken it off of my ipod since.  The songs are catchy, the vocals amazing, and the instrumentation unique.  A few other reviewers mentioned that they sound a bit like Queen.  I can see where they're coming from, but don't take that to mean this is some kind of 80's retro/homage album.  Recommended tracks (that I would personally rate 5 stars):    1. Be Calm  4. I Wanna Be The One  5. At Least I'm Not As Sad (As I Used To Be)    These babies make the whole album by themselves!  On a side-note, apparently the guy who fronts this band was one of the co-founders of another band called The Format.  If you like this, don't be afraid to check that band out too.  It's not as good, but it's enough like this where you'll feel at home.

B001GCUNWQ|5.0|Just a fun movie for adults and kids alike! It was fun to watch the characters continue on!
B0006GAOBI|5.0|I for one love movies closer to the as \\"concieved\\" or as filmed versions as possible. ALOT of studios and their execs have opinions that dont mesh with the people who came up with the idea in the first place. Mainly for timing issues, the shorter the movie the more seatings they fill and popcorn they sell. I love Directors cuts and extended version almost always over the theatrical cut. Why would you want to see a truncated, or shorter version \\"vision\\" when you can have it all. I like both versions but the longer cut always fills in more plot holes and or character development. This cut to me is more of a masterpiece more music (the songs meant to be there)more weirdness and, I love it!! Peace to all
B001K98MFA|5.0|I purchased this movie after seeing ghost in the shell, vol.1: which was also a great flick. This movie has great effects and color, the storyline was great as the first one was and the sound is especially great if you have a home theater system. Ghost in the shell vol.1 and 2 are smart,action packed movies so pick up both if you have none.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I give this DVD 4 hooves up!.... It's a MUST see if you have any concern for your well being.     As I was watching this thought provoking DVD, deep within my soul I felt saddened and ashamed for knowing that I have contributed to a living hell for so many animals that are factory farmed for my consumption. During the movie, I had an earth shattering revelation that I was a hypocrite... I fight for animals rights and environmental causes, yet I was blindly heading to the market for my families pre-packaged, guilt-free steaks & chicken, and processed foods.     I adore all animals, and I respect their lives. I respect Mother Earth. Yet I ate meat 3-5 times a week, and had no problem serving food from a box. All my life I have been a \\"flexitarian\\", but this DVD has changed my life and my diet. Actually, it threw me over the edge. I will no longer eat meat washed in ammonia, chickens washed in chlorine, and will no longer eat from a box. How dare these huge corporations think that we are their guinea pigs... willfully feeding cows 28 million pounds of antibiotics a year that end up in our bodies, feeding these animals genetically modified corn instead of grass (or hey), serving the American public \\"downed cow\\", diseased and sick chickens, who live their entire lives in knee deep feces. Welcome to their science experiment. They do not know the short or long term effect that their practices are having on the American people consuming their products, and knowing that that they don't care is sickening as well. All the information in this DVD should have been available to us consumers years ago. These corporations should have an open door policy and yet they hide and deceive what they are doing with the food products we are sticking in our face. I am now convinced, more than ever, that these corporations are the leading cause of most of our illnesses, and our food addictions. This DVD is your wake up call people. Ask yourself, who is in charge of your life?     Know wonderthese Corporation's had \\"no comment\\" for this documentary and did not want us to see the ugly truth behind their practices... no one in their right mind would think, \\"Um Beef... Sounds delicious!\\" I am so thankful that the \\"veil\\" of truth has been removed and now I can actually understand why Americans should eat organic, farm raised, free range, grass fed animals, and buy locally grown fruits and vegetables. I really get it now!     This DVD will make you sit and wonder; How could all this be true?, How could \\"they\\" allow this to go on?, Where are the food police?, and Does any one respect LIFE anymore? Is it all about the money for these corporate giants?... the answer to that one is easy to answer after viewing this wonderfully made DVD. Thank you Michael Pollan for helping me remove my blinders.

B0009UC7QQ|5.0|THE TRUMAN SHOW    We as a people seem to be obsessed with watching other people's lives as if ours is not good enough, it is called reality TV. Sure some watch it to see people more pathetic then themselves but for the most part people watch other people because they feel their lives are more interesting. Whatever the reason ther3e was a movie that kind of touched on that type of thing and may give a look into what may be the future of reality TV. Of course when this film was released a lot of people doubted it because Jim Carrey was acting more serious, how dare he. Well to those who thought that I hope they eventually saw this because it really is good, how dare they to doubt.    Truman Burbank is one of the best guys in the world who is loved by all and he gives that love back. He is the most polite and happy guy ever who has a nice life with a wife and best friend who love him. Or so he thought as his obsession with a lost love drives him to question what is real or fake. As he digs deeper and deeper things get riskier because he may find something he really does not want to know. His life as he knows it may have all been planned including his wife. Everyone around him seems to be in on it except the lady he so longingly wants to find. She is the one person who tried to tell him the truth, and as he tries to find the truth and leave the entire town tries to keep him there. It turns out that everything in his life is fake and he is forced to live out his life in this little bubble of a world, his life predetermined for him. A TV producer who adopted him as a new born has created a whole world around him and made him grow up there. It really is one of the most interesting films I have seen because this film may truly happen.    Jim Carrey is absolutely brilliant in this dramatic comedy showcases both sides of the actor all in the same film. The film does have its comedic moments especially the first half of the film but it is the dramatic stuff were Carrey trulyshines. For those who have not seen this he truly gives an award winning performance in my opinion. There is a scene in particular that really shows the pain and struggle of the character. In this scene he appears to be beaten when his boat reaches the end, it is a short scene but it is great. He shows excellent range in this film because up to this point in his career he was truly looked at as just a comedian.    Ed Harris as always is excellent and is brilliant in the lead villain role of a TV producer who wants nothing but ratings. He will go to any lengths to make his show a success and any lengths to keep Truman inside his world. Harris is perfect in this role even making him seem human at times. Laura Linney plays his wife in this film and is great, bringing life to a role were she is an actress, love it. Noah Emmerich as well is great in the film as his best friend; Paul Giamatti and Adam Tomei also are good as assistants to the producer. Everyone in the film do a great job as people who are all actors, I wonder if that was hard.    Written marvelously by Andrew Niccol this truly is a great film that mixes a perfect balance of different types of films. I can find moments for comedies, dramas, action, suspense, even horror because to be honest it is like one big Twilight Zone story. This film could have been a straight up comedy or a complete drama or even a really darker film, and all of them would have worked even with the same cast. While all those would have worked I happen to like the film director Peter Weir gave us. I highly recommend this movie because I have always enjoyed from day one. Skip the rental and buy this like I did, I think any movie goer will appreciate this film. Also there is an excellent and very in-depth behind the scenes feature on here.

B000000ITC|5.0|This CD has got a superb sound-quality. It sounds like a today production. In my opinion it is the best Alan Parsons CD. Buy it if you have a very good soundsystem.
B00027JYLC|5.0|You can read other reviews for the story line and the strengths and weaknesses of the film.  This is a flawed film in many ways, yet it is a fascinating and brave film.  Todd Browning deserves credit for raising the questions presented here and for treating the actors with dignity.    I have seen this movie a few times, usually on Turner Classic Movies.  I was pleasently surprised with this edition.  The picture and sound quality was much better than I was expecting.    Be aware this film is not to everyone's taste.  Some won't be able to get past the less than stellar acting.  Others may feel the unfortunate displayed here were exploited.  Keep in mind Todd Browning was a member of a traveling circus in his early years and this is a heartfelt effort by him to bring understanding to those who he worked with.
B0026P3G12|4.0|This is really a good album for those who enjoy mellow music.  When one finishes the album, it causes a sense of peace and beauty.  Hooray for Susan Boyle.
B00000ITOY|4.0|I bought this for my 18-month old daughter for Christmas and she really enjoyed it from the start.  She picked up on how to fit the circle shapes right away, and is still working on the others, but even putting the shapes in willy-nilly is fun for her.<br /><br />The only downside is that storage is tricky - the pieces can fall away from the board and get lost easily.  It seems like the designers could have fashioned some sort of rubber-band or even a lid that would hold things in place.

B001C4CI8U|5.0|Fringe is simply the only show on TV (or DVD) worth watching. We hadn't seen all the aired shows so we got the 1st season on DVD. It is just captivating. Anna Torv is wonderful to watch. She is a great actress. Peter Bishop, a bit predictable sometimes but he's sort of in the background anyway. Walter (John Noble) is brilliant and a scream!! I just love his parts. Astrid (Astro, Asteroid) is a lovely girl with a tricky job - but this team and the twists and turns they are involved in are so great. Almost like great 1950s Science Fiction. If you like suspense, a little gore here and there, mystery, and science, this is the show for you. MUCH better than X-files.    Cannot WAIT for Season 2 on DVD!!

0767821629|3.0|This is a good movie dealing with reality on several levels. The scenes are recreations of Los Angeles from the 30's and are quite remarkable.  This DVD does have another of Sony's odd encryption schemes designed more to frustrate the user than to protect the movie.

B001N26GFM|5.0|Simple story, but with considerable insight into Nazi brutality, and with a shocking ending.<br /><br />This story is pure fiction, for no Nazi death camp was built with only a single fence easily entered or escaped from; all fences were electrified, with armed guard towers. Stalag 17 has a more credible description.<br /><br />But the buildup to the end has an important message to tell, and this picture is worth seeing by the entire family.<br /><br />Conan

0812973992|5.0|Like many modern literary novels, LET THE GREAT WORLD SPIN is stylistically annoying. There are at least a dozen major characters, and they all have their own point of view. Author Colum McCann also conforms to the Cormac McCarthy school of dialogue convention: a dash, rather that quotation marks. It also takes McCann a good two hundred pages to get all of his characters on stage and start making connections.<br /><br />LTGWS starts with a tight-rope walker taking on the twin towers of the World Trade center in August of 1974. But the twelve characters are only tangentially related to this event. Some of them see it as it's happening. Others hear about it later. The action on the ground starts with an Irish monk named Ciaran Corrigan working with the prostitutes who parole outside the Deegan projects in the Bronx. He's atypical for a monk in that he doesn't preach and he doesn't try convert the prostitutes. He also endures several beatings from the prostitutes' pimps. A mother-daughter pair of prostitutes, Tillie and Jazzlyn Henderson, also carry quite a bit of the action. Gloria, a \\"church lady\\" who lives at the Deegan projects, becomes prominent in the story when Jazzlyn is killed in a car accident and Gloria volunteers to take Jazzlyn's children.<br /><br />An obvious theme of the novel is that we're all connected. Gloria has lost her three sons to Vietnam. She attends weekly meetings where mothers who have lost sons take turns hosting sessions to commiserate. That's where she meets Judge Solomon Soderberg's wife, Clair. He just happens to be the judge who tries the tightrope walker for public endangerment. For me, the scenes with Gloria and Clair and the other grieving mothers were the most compelling. One lives on Park Avenue, the other in the Deegan projects. But the Deegan mother has more compassion in her little finger than the other ladies, who laugh at Claire when she hosts one of the sessions. A close second would be the scenes with Tillie Henderson, the thirty-nine-year-old grandmother prostitute. She is called before Judge Soderberg just before the tightrope walker. She is unintentionally disrespectful; he's tempted to stick her with a contempt of court fine, but notices all the reporters in his courtroom and doesn't want to come off like a jerk. This is the only funny part of the book. The scenes with Tillie in them jump off the page; she's both funny and heart-wrenching.<br /><br />McCann is also saying something about art. He considers the tightrope walker an artist; he hops, does cartwheels, and runs across the cable, a hundred and ten stories above the street. He also spends a couple of chapters talking about the graffito taggers who work beneath the streets of New York, spray painting the subway walls, and the phone phreakers, who hack into the phone lines near the Twin Towers, trying to find out if the tightrope walker has survived. They are the first computer hackers, and they tie in with Claire's son who was a computer technician serving in Vietnam when he was killed. There are also a couple of real artists among the twelve point of view characters, one of whom leaves his paintings out in the rain, only to see art in what nature has done to a year's worth of work. McCann is having a bit of fun with this character.<br /><br />One minor complaint. What's with the interview at the end of the book? Do we really need another \\"literary\\" author questioning McCann. After a while he begins to sound a lot like Jonathan Franzen, whose \\"high art\\" was too good for Oprah. Just put the interview in PUBLISHERS WEEKLY where it belongs. Also, if you're like me, you'll be wondering how Philippe Petit, the original tightrope walker, got that cable to reach across to the other tower.

0316666343|4.0|Not a pleasant subject, but what a good book.  The author makes the reader feel \\"present\\" and within the story, and I found I couldn't put it down.  I haven't seen the movie yet, and hope it does justice to the book.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|In this album John shows a little bit of everything, from the melodic \\"All We Ever Do is Say Goodbye\\" to his bluesy rendition of \\"Crossroads\\".  I play this disc just about everyday and I never tire of it. A must for any John Mayer fan.
B0024FAR5W|5.0|This show is amazing. The actors play their roles perfectly and it clearly illustrates the Hamlet theme the show was going for. Season 2 gets even better - can't wait to buy that on Blu-Ray as well
B001U887PQ|5.0|These are comfortable and easy to slip on.  I wear them constantly.  They definitely meet my expectations.
B000P0J024|5.0|To be perfectly honest, I would have bought the entire album just for \\"End Of The Line,\\" but there's so much more, including a very good cover of Del Shannon's \\"Runaway.\\" These five guys made wonderful music together, and they weren't even serious about it. It's really a shame Roy Orbison and George Harrison couldn't have been with them (and us) longer.
1416550542|5.0|If you have read The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society then this a good book to read.  The characters are unforgettable.  Once you start reading the book it is hard to put in down.  You want to find out what is going to happen next.  Kate Morton's is extremely good at writing.  You can picture the cottage and the forgotten garden without a single picture of it.  You are right there observing all that is happening to each character.  This book was an absolute delight to read.
B001CTUI8M|5.0|This has to be one of THE best concerts, and lucky for us it has been captured in hi def video and sound.  Even if you are not a WT fan, the visuals, orchestra, choir, interplay between band members and sound quality delight the senses.  I own both Blu-ray and DVD versions, because I bought the DVD (The one I got comes with a CD recording of the concert) before I got my blu-ray player.  The upgrade to blu-ray is well worth the extra money but if you want the CD too, I would recommend the DVD version as well.  I highly recommend both versions but if you want the best video and sound, go for blu-ray...you won't be disappointed :-)
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|La imagen de la película en DVD es muy buena y en Blu-Ray es fantástica, el sonido es nítido y en 6 canales.  La película es muy agradable y a los niños les encanta.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|What a wonderful, entertaining, clever, funny, and great movie. This is easily the  best Star Trek movie ever made, and one of the best movies of 2009. It has a lot of heart, and a moving storyline with terrific acting by all. If you want to take a stirring adventure into outerspace aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise with top-notch special effects, then this colorful movie is for you.
B000001ESP|5.0|The cd was in perfectly new condition even though it was technically used. It is an awesome first Rush cd to get someone who is recently into the band, since is has Limelight and Tom Sawyer on it. It also has a lyric booklet included, which was pretty sweet.       Latres on the Menjay, Jobin!      The movie I Love You, Man has brought a younger generation to appreciate older music, and that's AWESOME!

B002R5V7MG|5.0|When Mahler's Symphony #1 was first performed in Budapest in 1889, you can be sure that there was controversy. The slow introduction to the first movement is interrupted by military fanfares and cuckoo calls. The Fahrenden Gesellen walking tune next is interrupted by trumpet fanfares. In the third movement Death the annihilator enters with a sinister funeral march based on the nursery tune Frere Jacques. In the finale we hear the cry of a wounded heart.<br />Now, 130 years later, this all sounds  like normal run of the mill Mahler to us. But a new composition by John Adams,which is well in the mainstream of New American Music championed by Philip Glass and Steve Reich, seems radical and risky to us. As noted in the program notes, jazz influenced classical music began with Darius Milhaud's La Creation du monde, Saudades do Brasil and Le boeuf sur le toit in the 1920s, followed by Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue.<br />Come on folks, give the guy a break! Check out Milhaud, Glass and Reich and give Adams another listen. This isn't Cage or Stockhausen, it's good old red, white and blue patriotic American music.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|Saw a performance of Celtic Woman on PBS and knew I had to have my own DVDs to watch when I wanted to hear superb voices.   Quality of the audio and picture was excellent as played on a standard Toshiba DVD player. Music selection varied between soft and amorous and, bright and cheerful.  Heartily recommend this DVD to those who love real music and heavenly voices.

B002Q4U9YU|5.0|This album would actually be my first Michael Jackson album. Even though I have heard these songs before but when I heard about the This is It Film and its soundtrack, I just got crazy. When I bought it, I thought its too exspensive and it could be a waste of my money but after many days of patience the album arrived at my doorstep and I was amazed by the sheer effort put in this album to make it possible.<br />  First of all, this was my first Michael Jackson Compilation album so I can't go to the point that Oh I've bought these compilations before. The songs were amazing. They were more clear, fresh and strong than their past counterparts especially \\"They Don't Care About Us\\" and \\"Billie Jean\\". The beat in \\"Billie Jean\\" was even more powerful and clear sonically. The songs on the album are all his hits but I felt \\"Bad\\" should have been there. The song \\"This Is It\\" also I heard it before on [...] and even though I had its catchy tune in mind,it felt great to hear it on my system. \\"This Is It (Orchestra Version)\\" is pretty good even though Orchestra has a very small part. In the end of the orchestra version, what I think is that we can also hear a small fraction of I think Jermaine Jackson's voice. The unreleased tracks of \\"Wanna Be startin' Somethin'\\". \\"She's Out of My Life\\" and \\"Beat It\\" were also great even though they had a small run time for like about 1 to 2mins. Planet Earth is also good to hear. I think I read someone's review of \\"She's Out of My Life\\"'s review on Amazon and they said the guitar in the song awesome. I think the demo should have been the final song due to the awesome guitar.<br />  Apart from the songs, The whole album is actually like a pictorial booklet which has Michael's last rehearsal photographs which are beautiful and totally amazing. When I hear these songs I see the photographs in the album and I feel like I'm there. What lacked in the album was the lyrics. This Is It proves to be more than just a simple album. It stands as a one of a kind Visual Album in which you can see and hear.<br />  For all those fans of Michael and music lovers, this album is a must for them and I mean it. The album is worth your money and time. THIS Is IT!!!!be more than just a simple album. It stands as a one of a kind Visual Album in which you can see and hear.                                     For all those fans of Michael and music lovers, this album is a must for them and I mean it. The album is worth your money and time. THIS Is IT!!!!

B000FDVOXO|4.0|I remember debating on which movie to get - the Extreme version or the Ultimate edition.  Since I don't have an adequate computer to play the hi-def scenes on the Extreme Version 2nd DVD, I think I would have liked the Ultimate edition better.  From the trailer of the Ultimate edition shown in this DVD, I think there is a much larger variety of information about the movie in the Ultimate Edition than the Extreme Edition.
B002L3RVCY|5.0|Clone Wars has the same impact that the CGI cartoon version of ROUGHNECKS had on the STARSHIP TROOPERS' movies.  In SST's case the cartoon were so much better than the movie and closer to Heinlein's military part of his book (sorry movie goers - Heinlein's government wasn't the least bit Fascist).  Clone Wars the movie was pretty good - the cartoons on TV are as good or better.  Still have a sense of humor and, FINALLY, different plots from STAR WARS IV.<br /><br />Recommend.

B002E9HACG|4.0|This is the best one since Final Countdown. I just got it and it really has a classic rock feel taking you back to the 70's and early eighties with a new twist kinda like the keyboard player puts it on their web site \\"THE 70'S MEETS THE NEW MILLENNIUM - ON     'SHROOMS...   I really like this one.
B002PMV9K6|4.0|awsome but the book was better, though there were things missing the movie is still great.
B00000JBFW|4.0|This one has some really strong songs on it. Dp had been split up for a long while and even longer from the most popular version of Mk .2. So this was very exciting to listen to for the first time . The guys didn't disappoint either ,especially on the first half of the album . I do not think this is as good as their early 70's stuff but it was one of the most awesome albums of its own time, still not afraid to stick to their own style when all the newer music of the time sounded so much diffrent.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|These are amazing! Love them! You cna hear directoions that shots come from and hear when the bad guy comes in for a shot int he back. These will help any first person shooter stay alive longer and keep everyone else in the real world around you asleep and sheel shock free.
8186336141|5.0|This is an excellent book for developing a complete yoga practice. The asana pages are helpful, but due to less attention being given to mudras, pranayamas and bandhas, those are the parts of this book that I just loved. The author even explains some of the science behind these practices. Furthermore, now that I have the book, I'm seeing it cited in many places as a source. A good investment for the serious practitioner.
B0015DYIH2|4.0|this book was my 2nd fav in the series  can't wait till midnight sun!
0805091742|1.0|I have noticed that almost every book on Amazon gets 90% good reviews.  The fact that even this book can get almost all 4 and 5 star reviews makes me question why the system is so skewed.  I'm not a hyper-critical reviewer as can be seen from my other reviews, but I found nothing useful in this book.  I expected to get some useful insight, I gained none.  I found the book to be one trite anecdotal story after another about how someone using a checklist saved the day.  Let me sum it up for you.  Each story goes something like this.  Group A does task A and doesn't use a checklist.  Group B does task A and doesn't use a checklist.  Group C does task A and *does* use a checklist.  And then the author anecdotally relates what a better job group C did because they used a checklist, usually providing no data to back up his claims.    For those looking for any advice on better methods of implementing checklists, don't expect to find *any*.  And don't expect to have the author ask any obvious questions such as, \\"maybe people/companies who use checklists do better not because by their very nature they are more disciplined and also perform other processes well\\".  In other words, as the well known science phrase goes, correlation does not imply causation.  Obviously I was expecting much more from this book.  In my industry the use of checklists is common, in fact it's fairly common in any industry that does repetitive tasks, even the building industry for example.  So when I saw this book I assumed it *had* to be something more than just stories about using checklists, that it was going to provide those of us who live by checklists some insight.  It doesn't.  If you know how to write a 10 point checklist, you're good to go, no need to buy this book unless you just want to read some anecdotal stories abut how a checklist saved the day.
B00005JMEW|5.0|For as much violence and gore as is contained in Quentin Tarantino's FOURTH FILM (as he so gratuitously informs us in the opening credits!), I think that KILL BILL VOLUME ONE is a great example of the \\"less is more\\" philosophy of filmmaking. Of all of Tarantino's films, this one has the LEAST dialogue. In fact, it is really minimalist. I don't think there is one wasted line in the whole film! It just cuts (literally) to the chase. In all his other films, with possibly the exception of PULP FICTION, I really think that some of the extraneous, extended dialogue ruins some or all of the film experience.<br /><br />KILL BILL VOLUME ONE has a singular plot: a mysterious woman (given the moniker \\"The Bride\\" by the head of a group of Texas Rangers who find her the sole survivor of her wedding day massacre in a small Texas church), is out to avenge the death of her baby at the hands of her former assassin colleagues The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. The group's leader is \\"Bill\\", heard, but unseen to the viewer during his part in the film. Bill shot The Bride in the head but she survived and was comatose for 4 years before awakening. \\"The Bride\\" is played by Uma Thurman, who IMHO gives the best performance of her career and should have garnered a Best Actress nomination for fully transforming herself into an athletic, cold-blooded, take-no-prisoners death machine! Thurman is entirely convincing in this role and never once did I doubt her character or her goal.<br /><br />In VOLUME ONE, Tarantino has The Bride only go after Vernita Green (played to the hilt by Vivica Fox in a brief, juicy role) and O'Ren Ishii (superbly played by Lucy Liu). The Bride's confrontation with Vernita sets up the film and this scene is an impressive, bloody, chickfight of hand-to-hand combat with a very satisfying conclusion. The film is told nonlinearly as we see early on that The Bride has already taken out O'Ren and the rest of the film details the sequence of events leading up to this. Tarantino really displays extremely competent, confident filmmaking during these sequences as he smoothly transitions from one story to the next, including a wonderful Japanese anime scene detailing the backstory of O'Ren and The Bride's seeking out famed swordsmaker Hattori Hanzo (pitch-perfect Sonny Chiba) to obtain a sword that \\"even God himself\\" would fear! The exciting, pulse-pounding climax has The Bride take on O'Ren's psychotic teen bodyguard Gogo Yubari (impressive ingenue Chiaki Kuriyama) and her \\"Crazy 88\\" army. Then, finally, the swordfight between The Bride and O'Ren, a beautifully executed (no pun intended!) otherwordly scene.<br /><br />What makes KILL BILL VOLUME ONE a masterpiece to me is that Tarantino perfectly mixes elements of several film genres and sub-genres (70s kung fu, Western, revenge, chick flick) into a brilliantly edited film. He also infuses the film with timely, snappy, witty, comical dialogue and narration (Thurman's) as well as perfect music choices, esp. using that Japanese group in the club at the film's climax to underscore the upcoming action. Nothing feels out of place or unnecessary in this film. In summary, it all just comes together!<br /><br />KILL BILL VOLUME ONE is about as entertaining as it gets!
B002AEB8P0|5.0|I watched Eurovision last year and when I heard the sing 'Fairytales\\" I was amazed by his talent. But sadly I live in Texas not Europe or Norway, so I have to pay alot of money for a CD, hopefully my family in Spain can just send me it. But if not I would buy it here, because I just love his songs. (Especially \\"Funny Little World\\" and \\"Roll With the Wind\\".)
B002PMV9K6|4.0|I have not been a huge fan of the Harry Potter movies since Chris Columbus stopped directing, but that's certainly not the fault of these young actors who are doing a marvelous job!  Movie was entirely as expected - mediocre directing, great acting, mediocre screen play.  I am pleased with the product - it was entirely what I expected.
B002UD56I6|5.0|Maybe it felt more intimate. Or maybe it was all the special features.  Whatever the case, I LOVED seeing this movie again and enjoyed it a thousand times more at home than when I saw it in the theater.  I loved it so much, I watched it 3 times over one weekend!<br /><br />Michael Jackson is simply the best, bar none.  But his best talent wasn't his singing, or even his dancing -- its that he was such a wonderful human being.  MJ holds a Guinness record for giving to the most charities and even left a third of his estate to charity.  No one else comes close to his generosity, and his kind and gentle spirit is evident in This Is It.<br /><br />It's the little things I loved seeing -- simple gestures, his reactions to something that was said, his laugh.  What a special man the world has lost.<br /><br />When I saw the movie in the theater, the crowd laughed in certain spots and I didn't understand why.  Maybe they were just giddy at seeing this icon.  Or maybe MJ was just misunderstood right to the end.  One moment in particular happened when Michael gave a correction to a band member on how his music should be played.  After giving the correction MJ says, \\"with love; l-o-v-e\\"  then he looks down and shuffles his feet like a gentle child and says \\"we'll get there; we'll get there....\\"  It's a simple moment that offers a glimpse into the soul of this special man.  An egomaniacal superstar would've gotten angry or been more intense.  But not Michael.  Everything was done with gentle love and support -- L-O-V-E.  But since we live in a world dominated by anger, the crowd laughed at MJ's comment.  They didn't know how to process seeing a gentle spirit asking for what he needs without anger, animosity or being a ruthless dictator; just love -- L-O-V-E.  And when faced with that simple, gentle leadership, all the crowd could do was laugh.  In effect, they may have missed the real essence of who MJ was and how he goes about things -- that it's possible to lead yet still be kind.  But few can grasp the power of that simplicity in this partisan world.<br /><br />Another favorite moment was seeing the dancers watch MJ dance and how much they appreciated it.  They cheered, jumped for joy and were in awe of this special man, decades their senior.  If it was thrilling for me just to watch, I can only imagine what it must have felt like in person.<br /><br />A testament to MJ's greatness is how everyone across the board would say \\"It's Michael\\" -- meaning, to work with him is something very special, and they felt compelled to give their absolute best for him.  From dancers to musicians to corporations wanting to lend their technology -- everyone gave their best, and then some, because \\"it's Michael.\\"<br /><br />Person after person shared their own story of MJ coming to them with an idea for the show.  They were often worried and said, \\"That's going to cost a lot of money and be a lot of work.  No one's ever done this before.\\"  Then they'd grin while recounting MJ's reply,  \\"I know.  That's why we have to do it.\\"  And somehow, they'd find a way to give MJ what he wanted, because \\"it's Michael\\" and the show had to be special.  I suspect that's why MJ ran into trouble with prescription drugs, because \\"it's Michael\\" and everyone wanted to make him happy.  I think I would've had a hard time saying no to him too.  But it's important to remember MJ wasn't like the rest of us; he had special needs.  He was mortal, of course, but not ordinary.  I don't fault him for doing what he felt he needed to do.  But he just should have sought out better care and done things under the proper supervision.  But perhaps even MJ forgot how special he was and how much the world still needed him, and forgot to take care of himself so he could continue to go on.<br /><br />The special features on the blu-ray also went on to explain and show some of the costumes made for the concert, and I truly regret not being able to see MJ in full regalia.  The costumes were stunning to say the least.  One outfit had so many crystals on it they said you needed sunglasses just to work on it.  I can just imagine how MJ would have glowed onstage in that; sparkling and twinkling like the mega-star he was.  And then there was the Billie Jean outfit that had pulsing lights running from his socks, up his pants and arm, up to his iconic glove -- it most certainly would have been a jaw-dropping show stopper.  Why?  Cuz it's Michael.  Cuz he was that special. Cuz it would have been a once in a lifetime experience.<br /><br />I couldn't help but think that some of the blu-ray's special features should have been in the movie itself.  But Kenny Ortega made the choice to let the film be predominantly a concert movie; or a \\"making of\\" concert movie, so to speak.  And I understand that.  But the special features offer insight that the movie didn't.  The movie lets us be _with MJ as much as possible, while the special features let others _speak about what they thought and felt.

I can just imagine how MJ would have glowed onstage in that; sparkling and twinkling like the mega-star he was.  And then there was the Billie Jean outfit that had pulsing lights running from his socks, up his pants and arm, up to his iconic glove -- it most certainly would have been a jaw-dropping show stopper.  Why?  Cuz it's Michael.  Cuz he was that special. Cuz it would have been a once in a lifetime experience.    I couldn't help but think that some of the blu-ray's special features should have been in the movie itself.  But Kenny Ortega made the choice to let the film be predominantly a concert movie; or a \\"making of\\" concert movie, so to speak.  And I understand that.  But the special features offer insight that the movie didn't.  The movie lets us be _with MJ as much as possible, while the special features let others _speak about what they thought and felt.

B001OQCV6A|5.0|Most people's expectations of Sherlock Holmes is \\"supposed to be\\" are shaped by what they saw in movies and a few tv episodes, maybe reading a few of the original stories. This classic view is often wrong. This movie brings back Holmes to what he was in the books, and while it may focus a little more on the action, some parts of Holmes' characteristics from the original books are toned down (the original Holmes had a penchant for drug abuse).     In any case, the movie taken by itself is spectacular. Robert Downey Jr. is phenomenal and Jude Law, whom i'm not usually fond of, is solid as Watson. The overall story is fast-paced but never lets you down, and I disagree with the editorial above that the plot is a mess. The plot is very smart, letting you guess at what's coming without actually telling you but never leaving you behind. For those worried about the action: while it is there, Holmes rarely relies on action as his sole weapon. His mind is the most effective tool in this movie; his fists are just a way of executing his plans.     Also of note is Hans Zimmer's music: providing an eclectic and original score that I believe is his best work (yes, better than the Dark Knight).     All in all, this movie is one of my favorites, and I will be buying the DVD as soon as it comes out.
B00005JNJV|4.0|This movie has grabbed the attention of all those who have grown up in American culture with batman as there childhood hero. This movie revives the darker side of the dark knight as opposed to the corny movies of the nineties. It is a heart breaking scene to see the psychological trauma the young Bruce Wayne goes through as his parents are gunned down and become the victims of a mugging. As a result of this trauma Bruce becomes confused about his life and his purpose, he becomes a bit of a juvenile brat of sorts. Upon the hard truth that a friend named Rachel gives him, Bruce sets out upon a soul searching period and travels to Asia and ends up in a prison that toughens him up. Finally he is discover by a ninja master who belongs to a sect that has for centuries used their power to better the world through violent means. This group has a truly utilitarian view of justice seeing that it doesn't matter who gets hurt as long as in the end more happiness and peace can be seen in the world. It is interesting to note that this line of thought wouldn't typically be found in the Asian culture, but is more a western idea that was imposed on them in this movie. Bruce eventually rejects this philosophy and seeks what he considers to be just vengeance. The one difference between the ninja sect that trained him is that he refuses to kill because it will make him like the criminals and particularly the criminals that killed his parents. Bruce takes one the image and title batman in response to a childhood fear of his, in order to frighten the criminals from their ways. Near the end of the movie he pushes the line with his convictions by letting a man he could have saved die, in some sense relieving him of the guilt of the mans death.    Overall this movie is a good watch although there are some philosophical reservations that should be taken into account. It is an interesting fact that the \\"bad guys\\" where a group with a utilitarian philosophy and the \\"good guy\\" had a self imposed ethical code which is a very postmodern way of thought. This is interesting because postmodernism is the trendy thing or the worldview that is in at the moment. How this movement comes out in movies is subtle but their there if you look for them.   Also ethics is something that simply can't be avoided when dealing with Hollywood movies. The sad fact is that Bruce was seeking revenge for his parents and could never and can never become satisfied with it because of the simple fact that vengeance only leaves a person feeling empty inside. He took his anger out on those whom never did him any person harm, and as a result of the life he has chosen to live he pushes away the only one in his life whom could perhaps find relief from his pain in. And do we really want our young people to buy into the mentally that when someone wrongs you, violence is the proper response towards those who do wrong. Is it not those that live by the sword that die by it. And those that are violent only spawn more violence around them. Although it should be noted that appropriate responses to correlating crimes under the law are a bit different. But to become a vigilante and break the law in order to uphold it is a bit oxymoronish.    Batman is yet another in a series of dark heroes who push the line as far as most can accept it. Everything unto the point of death, even torture is deemed right or even ethical for the batman. The impressionable young are never considered when these heroes are portrayed sadly to say. And to say that they and even us adults aren't impressionable is absurd, if not then explain to me why the advertising industry spends billions of dollars a year on media if it didn't have an effect on how people behaved? So I strongly caution open armed acceptance, especially ethically of this movie.
0786939532|5.0|This is the beginning of the Legend of Drizzt series, which shouldn't be missed by any fantasy fan. It is the definitive Forgotten Realms series. I recommend it. This series is great fun. It's filled with classic characters and memorable moments in a popular and interesting world. Homeland starts just before the birth of Drizzt the Dark Elf in the underground city of Menzoberranzan, home of the evil Dark Elves. A good reading experience you won't forget.

B001FB4W02|5.0|This season's introduction of Doomsday, and development of Jimmy and Tess's characters were spectacular. I especially enjoyed the extras on Doomsday and Allison Mack's directoral debut. It shows how the team from the producers to the cast to the crew are still inspired in coming up with compelling stories. Still a treat to watch!
B00328R21C|5.0|It seems that sellers feel like they can charge what ever they want for lego items. As suggested, you can find this item at Lego dot com for twenty five dollars. Its to bad that lego com does not list items forsale here, because the prices would be at list and not what these sellers are charging.

B000002UA5|5.0|I've always enjoyed the soundscape aspect of Pink Floyd.  This CD set has a shining example of live Floyd with the peak songs of the psychadelic soundscape early floyd era.  The second studio disc has loads of creative potential and a few jems with lyrics.  the majestic powerful sounds of Sysyphus; the sweet airy sounds of Grantchester Meadows (a PF favorite of mine); the Narrow way is full of curiousity; the Grand Vizer's Garden is pure clean syncopated noises
B001U887VU|5.0|I love these Crocs.  They are very warm to wear outside in winter.  I am not particularly fond of the look of any of the Crocs, but I wear them for volleyball instead of a sandal (barefoot player in sand), so when I wash my feet I don't have to be too worried about how clean or dry my foot is.  They look nice with the fuzzy part hanging out of the shoe.
B002PMV9K6|4.0|I did like it, however it didn't follow through with the same degree of intensity as the other movies did.  Perhaps that's simply due to the story line but when watched in succession, each gets progressively darker and more intense and this one seems to taper off when I anticipated a gripping conclusion.  None the less, I enjoy the series and this is no exception.
006621131X|5.0|This book is fascinating. Patti remembers, in details which are impressive, her first meetings with rock legends,Janis Joplin, Grace Slick and Jimi Hendrix as well as major poets and artists of the 60s and 70s. She tells the story in vivid detail of how it was for her and Robert Mapplethorpe as they trudged through life in New York City having little money and a whole lot of heart and soul and thier emergance as artists. She opens the doors into the legendary Chelsea Hotel and paints a lively painting of all who graced the halls. This book tells of the wanderings of two \\"kids\\" looking for a way to express what they had inside ,found eachother and through finding eachother ,found themselves and touched the eyes and ears of us. This is a love story told with tenderness and depth. Very touching. Thanks Patti.
0312360266|1.0|I loved the Twilight series, so I wanted to find something to read after I finished it. I heard about this series and decided to try it. In the first few pages I realized that this is definitely a teenager's book. The language is immature to say the least. If you're over the age of 20 and you loved Twilight, then find something else, because this is a major disappointment.
1401917232|5.0|Yes, Gary has certainly tested the patience of many of his readers that liked his 2 monumental books. The DISAPPEARANCE OF THE UNIVERSE, is a classic that probably cannot ever be outdone by Gary. His second book was good but not when compared with the first one. If the third book which is tardy matches even the 2nd one it will be worth waiting for. I have read the Disappearance of the Universe 7 times and the 2nd book about 3 times. If there is information from Pursah and Arten in it then it certainly will be valuable. These books can really be considered channelled information because the information comes from sources outside our physical realm. That type of information can be invaluable when coming from the same line of thinking that produced Jesus. Pursah and Arten could be considered descendants on the same line of thinking that produced Jesus. Their message is timely and eternal and will not be old hat 500 years from now.
B000DZIGDU|3.0|If you are expecting a smash 'em up, blow 'em up movie then you will be let down.  Why do we have the mindset anyway that all war movies have to have non-stop action.  No, this not a great movie nor is it a classic.  However, it is a decent movie with some excellent acting and decent storyline to hold your attention.<br /><br />If memory serves me right, much of Desert Shield deployment was just what we have here in the storyline......mundane.  That's not to say there was no action during the first round with Saddam it just wasn't overly exciting.  And, to dress it up to be something that it was not does not do honor to the brave men and women who served during that deployment.
B002WY65W4|5.0|Just sat through my third viewing of the film as it never gets old. What helps is that the BD is packed with a lot of fun stuff and contains a great transfer.<br /><br />The picture clarity is ideal from beginning to end. A couple of the green screen shots in the Hummer were a little dark, but overall each sequence had a solid presentation. The picture was so clear the camera vehicles and crew were painfully obvious in 15-20 of the scenes, but it didn't bother me as the whole film is a treat to sit through. The DTS was overamped to the outer channels so some of the dialogue was garbled, but not often. The surrounds get used extensively, with plenty of zombie noise hitting the rear sets. The supplements are thorough and include:<br /><br />*A picture in picture track. Intermittent and takes roughly a 30% cut of the screen, usually in HD. Noticed that some of the cuts were taken from the other supplements.<br />* In search of Zombieland, 15:57 minutes. Clip heavy documentary covering the background, writing and behind the scenes. Funniest part was Breslin kept trying to convince them to let her be a zombie, but the writers said no.<br />* Deleted scenes, 5 totaling less than 6 minutes. Some OK filler, not as many as I had thought there would be.<br />* Zombieland is your Land, 11:59 minutes. The behind the scenes on stunts, effects and zombies; worth the watch to see how they pulled off the gal through the windshield effect and some of the other fun sequences.<br />* Progression on FX scenes, 4 clips totaling less than 3 minutes. Not worth the time, was better seeing them in the PiP track.<br />* BD Live. The first time I have seen the option here of it previewing what is on BD Live before having to sign in/log in (shows up on the main menu if you let the cursor sit on that option). I saw there was nothing new on the connection so did not waste the time.<br />* Disc 2 is the Dig Copy for PC, Mac and PSP.<br />* Commentary with cast and crew, see below.<br />* MovieIQ (the IMDB on your screen thing). I turned this option on while listening to the commentary so I feel like a zombie aficionado now, both are worth the time.<br /><br />French and English DTS 5.1, Descriptive Audio, English and French subs. Region coded A/B/C. Highly recommend the overall product, I think you will feel it a worthy investment.ption on while listening to the commentary so I feel like a zombie aficionado now, both are worth the time.

B002KREVCO|4.0|Ok, alright, I admit it:  I WAS going to use this review as an opportunity to moan and complain and whine but ultimately...ouuuff... (very long exhale and sigh...) I changed my mind...I decided that, other than relieving myself, such a review wouldn't end up being much more useful. And so, instead of writing the review immediately after getting this box, I waited a couple of months in order to chill, make most of my whining privately, and THEN write something a bit more objective. But before digging into the actual review, I still feel compelled to give you all a bit of the thoughts I have entertained in the back of my head for the past couple of months, so please bear with me.<br /><br />As you probably know by now, there are 2 versions of \\"Backtracks\\":  a 2 CD + 1 DVD \\"standard\\" one, available pretty much anyplace where CD's are still sold (fewer and fewer of those every day...), and a limited, super-duper, \\"there go the keys to Angus' car\\" Deluxe version that comes in a guitar amplifier-shaped box that ACTUALLY WORKS as amplifier!!! At 200 bucks, it's hardly a bargain! Needless to say, most people are sticking to the budget version.<br /><br />On paper, this is a fantastic idea: after decades (literally!) of lurking in obscurity, releasing some of the rarest, most sought after AC/DC material is a dream come true for diehards. Indeed, for years AC/DC's catalog was consistently butchered, starting with the questionable decision of creating a \\"compilation\\" out of the band's first 2 Australian releases for international release, changing the running order and song lineup of albums, throwing together quick cash-ins ('74 Jailbreak), using shorter length edits of songs and so forth.<br /><br />The 1997 \\"Bonfire\\" 5 disc box marked an opportunity to clear the decks of ALL Bon Scott-related goodies, but alas, that didn't happen. Then with the turn of the millennium AC/DC announced that they were switching labels to Columbia and taking their entire catalog with them. This move represented the shiniest chance to right all those wrongs, completely revamping the entire AC/DC catalog, restoring all the missing songs to their rightful place and maybe even issuing the first 2 Australian albums as they were intended. Once again, no such luck.<br /><br />So in all honesty, being a huge AC/DC fan myself, I had mixed feelings when this release was announced: I wasn't too crazy about the prohibitive price tag for the deluxe edition, or the fact that it was going to have so much more material than the regular one (3 CD's, 2 DVD's, a 180 gram vinyl LP, among many other goodies) but still, my inner, rocking self got the best of me and I decided to order it anyway.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there was still some more disappointment to come, when I double checked the song lineup of the \\"Rarities\\" CD and confirmed that, instead of 18 songs as on the deluxe version, the regular version would only have 12 songs, skipping the longer \\"Australian album versions\\" of several songs.  I find this fact to be really hard to justify, considering that the omission has absolutely nothing to do with running time/song length issues (the Rarities CD is barely 46 minutes long). Oh well...<br /><br />Enough nitpicking: all things considered, \\"Backtracks\\" still packs quite a punch, and it will be a great addition to any AC/DC fan's collection. Although some of the tracks here had been previously available as b-sides and/or international album releases, Disc 1 is obviously the biggest treat here, finally unearthing for the world at large 7 obscure tracks from the Bon Scott era and 5 from the Brian Johnson years. \\"Stick Around\\" and \\"Love Song\\", originally from the Australian \\"High Voltage\\" album, are the opening salvos (finally making available ALL of the tracks that appeared on their debut), and they show a contrast that is quite unique: the former is a nice, slow burning rocker that can probably remind you a bit of \\"Rn'R Damnation\\", while the latter is the ONLY \\"ballad\\" in AC/DC's entire career, and while it is not one of my favorites tunes here, it is not the terrible, throwaway track that some reviewers are making it out to be either; \\"Fling Thing\\" is a quick, mostly instrumental take on a traditional folk song that had previously surfaced as \\"Bonny\\" on 1992's \\"Live\\".<br /><br />\\"R.I.P (Rock in Peace)\\" and \\"Carry me Home\\" are another pair of mid-tempo rockers that really cook, and the lyrics of the latter are prretty funny, although a bit ironic in retrospect, considering Bon's untimely demise due to alcohol abuse related causes; \\"Crabsody in Blue\\" is the slowest, blusiest of the bunch, and to be honest, not one if my favorites...I'm not quite sure why...it may have something to do with the fact the vocals follow the exact same melody of the guitar (or is it the other way around? and the same applies to \\"Love Song\\", come to think about it)... Anyway, it's not bad, but it doesn't really do it for me; \\"Cold Hearted Man\\" on the other hand, the final Bon Scott track, is another terrific song with great lyrics and performance from Bon, one of personal favorites of the pack along with \\"Carry me home\\".<br /><br />The \\"Brian Johnson section\\" consists of 3 outtakes from the \\"Blow Up Your Video\\" sessions, a soundtrack tune and a \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\" leftover. The nasty \\"Big Gun\\", recorded with Rick Rubin for the soundtrack of the infamous 1993 non-blockbuster \\"Last Action Hero\\" flick is, in my humble opinion,another one of the highlights of this release: it features a slick, crystal clear production that's unlike anything else in AC/DC's catalog (before AND after), and the sonic contrast is immediately apparent to anyone familiar with the band, but still manages to rock your socks off big time! It's funny, `cos I really don't remember ever noticing that before, but I also have to admit that I hadn't really listened to the tune in ages...the thing that amazes me the most is that its sound isn't even close to that of \\"Ballbreaker\\", which was also produced by Rubin only a couple of years later.<br /><br />The \\"Blow Up Your Video\\" tunes are really cool, and I can't help but wonder what criteria could they possibly have followed to leave them out and use songs like \\"Go Zone\\" and/or \\"Mean Streak\\" instead...don't get me wrong, those aren't bad songs either, but I firmly believe that, had these 3 tracks been used instead, \\"Blow Up Your Video\\" would've been a much stronger album and it would be held in much higher esteem on the AC/DC pantheon as a result. \\"Snake Eye\\" and \\"Borrowed Time\\" are great rockers, with powerful, driving riffs and great beats, while \\"Down on the Borderline\\" slows down the pace somewhat but still rocks along nicely; \\"Cyberspace\\", from the \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\", is a short and fast burst of energy that closes disc 1 on a high note. All in all, 5 stars for this one.<br /><br />Disc 2 features \\"Live Rarities\\"...eeeh... not exactly my cup of tea...first, only 4 songs are from the Bon Scott years, and while they are great, I can't help but feeling that they could have/should have given us some more; second, many of these songs (8 out of 15) had already been released in a live format on \\"Live\\", so they could (should?) have included some other choices of songs not available in live format, such as \\"Hell ain't a bad place to be\\", \\"Ballbreaker\\", \\"Hard as a rock\\" and/or \\"Hail Caesar\\", all available on the pricier version of the box; third: (and I know I'm going to take a lot of heat over this one...) I personally am not a big fan of Brian's  early 80's, \\"screeching\\" falsetto voice...I happen to believe that Brian didn't truly find his voice until the late 80's, and I'd take his performances on \\"Live\\" over these ones any day of the week (but again, that's just me...); and last but certainly not least, I'm not too crazy about the final mix of these tracks: don't get me wrong, they don't sound bad at all, but if you compare them (and I have...) with the tracks on \\"Live\\", these ones sound tiny and distant, whereas \\"Live\\" had a roaring, in your face quality that really made you feel like you were there. So in this case, I'd say \\"nice, but not great\\"...3 out 5 stars.<br /><br />And finally, the DVD...\\"Family Jewels 3\\"...again, not exactly up my alley...I'm not a big fan of DVD's, music or otherwise (my \\"library\\" consists of the Star Wars DVD's and that's it...), so I wasn't particularly looking forward to this one, either...but hey, that's just me, and I'll be the first one to admit that I'm a total freak from another world, so don't rely on my opinion alone to judge this one! If you're a fan of the visual and you enjoyed the first 2 volumes, then this is a must for you: all of the band's videos from 1993 to 2009 are included here, not to mention alternate takes of some older material (\\"It's a Long Way to the Top if you Wanna Rn'R\\", \\"You Shook me All Night Long\\"...) and a couple of funny \\"behind the scenes/making of\\" documentaries. All in all, it makes for an entertaining viewing experience, which I'd rate with 4 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Oh, yeah, I always forget to mention: the booklet! It's pretty cool, with lots of funny, candid, outrageous and rocking pics of the boys throughout this 30+ year odyssey. In a world of constant change where it's easy to sometimes feel adrift, it's nice to know (and in this case, SEE!) that some things, (good things, that is) never change. The liner notes provide adequate information about the source of the material herein, except with disc 1, where the information about band lineup is missing. Oh well, no biggie.<br /><br />The bottom line: all complaints aside, this is a great set, and a must for true AC/DC fans everywhere: 5 stars for disc 1, 3 stars for disc 2, and 4 stars for disc 3, for a average of 4 stars overall. Of course, if you really, really have money to burn, then I'd suggest you give the Deluxe edition a try. If you don't, but you really and truly enjoy AC/DC, you need to get this. Then, and only then, will your AC/DC collection be complete.ow Up Your Video\\" tunes are really cool, and I can't help but wonder what criteria could they possibly have followed to leave them out and use songs like \\"Go Zone\\" and/or \\"Mean Streak\\" instead...don't get me wrong, those aren't bad songs either, but I firmly believe that, had these 3 tracks been used instead, \\"Blow Up Your Video\\" would've been a much stronger album and it would be held in much higher esteem on the AC/DC pantheon as a result. \\"Snake Eye\\" and \\"Borrowed Time\\" are great rockers, with powerful, driving riffs and great beats, while \\"Down on the Borderline\\" slows down the pace somewhat but still rocks along nicely; \\"Cyberspace\\", from the \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\", is a short and fast burst of energy that closes disc 1 on a high note.

B001PPLJJ0|5.0|This is a great drama which just comes alive on Blu ray.<br />And Kate Winslet's performance is not one that in ten years people will say: \\"why did she win best actress back then?\\" No, they will say: 'that was a incredible performance and and  truly the best female one of 2009 on film.\\" She's that good in this movie , in fact she plays the older seductress that every teen boy dreams of: sexy , experienced , beautiful and mysterious.  And then takes this character into her older age in which she does not age gracefully , instead she's a broken woman forgotten and alone. Will her former lover help her in her time of need? or will he abandon her because of the terrible things she did during World War 2 while serving in the S.S.?  You have to watch the movie to find out ( or read the book) and of course you will want to watch it on blu ray. The picture quality is vivid and there are no defects in the film at all. Unlike older movies they didn't have to worry about faded film and bad prints and they remastered this one excellently.  The rest of the cast is top notch and this is a A movie in every since of the word. The blu ray has delted scenes and other features which add further insight, This movie is not a feel good happy movie thouhg,  it's a solid intelligent drama that is well worth seeing. It does have nudity , sexual content,  and descriptions of extreme violence, so this is a movie for adults or at least noone under 17 I would say.  But I am glad that I finally got to see this incredible performance from one of the best actresses around today.
1933492287|4.0|I agree with all of the rave reviews that this book has received.  The only reason I gave it only 4 of 5 is because the book has fallen apart in my hands, just like the first copy I bought and returned!!!   Buyer beware!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins is really on her game!  Hunger Games is truly a satisfying book that engages the reader from the onset. The heroine, Katniss, is thrown into a life or death battle of twenty-four competitors from which only one can emerge victorious.  Both girls and boys alike will enjoy this gruesome thriller story line.
1400106338|4.0|I love Jane Austen's classic novel.  I listened to this version while commuting to work, and while I enjoyed the narration, at times the voicing is shrill.  I found I had to adjust the volume more often than with other audiobooks.
B0030BYWKK|5.0|You have to give this a second listen. As a self-obsessed fan of their Trials of Van... album, i will admit that i got bored after the 4th song or so, questioning myself \\"is this it??\\"  But, upon a second and third listen, i think you will find that, like many other reviews have already stated, this is a much more focused, dark and grandiose sound. It isn't as poppy as Trials, but it is heartbreakingly beautiful. I love this album just as much as Trials, but in a very different way. It has taken me away to mountainous woods, and stowed me away in a log cabin..
B002GJT4XM|5.0|I am very happy with my decision to purchase the Ultimate edition of HP & the Sorcerer's Stone.  I'm one that very much enjoys seeing the behind-the-scenes info included on DVD extras.  That being said, I was most disappointed in the extras on the original SS DVD.  Granted, at that time, WB was aiming the movie strictly at children & the extra features were appropriately \\"kid entertaining.\\"<br />  The Ultimate edition has a wealth of extras with additions to satisfy HP fans of all ages. A plus is the theater release version is included as well as the extended edition (for those times you just want to be nostalgic), plus a digital copy.  The behind-the-scene extras are excellent & very well done, with the advantage of having the actors, now much older, being able to comment & share thoughts of \\"back then.\\"  It is very fascinating to learn all that went into the original creation of this world visually - things we as viewers tend to take for granted - & how that has served as the basis for all the subsequent films.<br />  I had originally planned on only purchasing the Ultimate edition of the 1st movie.  After seeing the quality of material & care taken in the making of this one, I'm afraid I'll be purchasing them all as they come out!
B0025KVLTC|5.0|I am a big Beatle's fan and saw them in concert in Portland, OR 1964.  At one point in my life I owned most Beatle's albums, Revolver being one of them. I lost these albums mainly to loaning them out and never getting them back. I think Revolver has some of the best songs that the Beatle's ever wrote. I am also an audio phile and am very particular about recording quality.  The remastering of Revolver is very well done.  I highly recommend Revolver (remastered).  R.E.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|Ok first off let me star by saying how sad it is that movies like district 9 dont make as much money as they should or even enough time in the spotlight. I for one think this movie was the best movie of 2009 BETTER than AVATAR! Avatar was a great movie but in no means was it James camrons best (Terminator 2) but it was a fun and emotional ride. The reason i think District 9 was a superior movie is because it was much deeper and dealt with current situations and themes the world without rubbing political views in your face, I know it can seem anti big corporation and military but in no way does it have that stereotypical over the top and cheesy warmonger feel to the villains like avatar did. The Characters had depth and instead o fitting into a stereotype they were extremely complex, for example wikus  he starts off as an MNU public relations agent, when he starts transforming he abandons MNU for an alien (prawn as there called in the movie)  named christopher Wikus helps the prawn find the liquid that started his transformation but his motive are selfish and when told it would take three years to fix his condition Wikus betrays Christopher. as the movie progresses Wikus starts to realize that these Aliens need help and that they are living souls so he puts aside his selfish objective and almost sacrifices his life to save Christopher. NOW THATS A CHARACTER! Ill admit I Love Avatar and i enjoyed watching it but the story has been done a million times and the characters are the clones to the characters in camrons Aliens. Strong independent woman CHECK, military man with a heart CHECK, greedy corporate @ss hole CHECK, Butch woman BIG CHECK..... the list goes on. im just saying Avatar left me feeling like i just watch a recycled movie with blue aliens instead of indians, while district 9 made me feel like i could breath in an ocean of bad movies.
B000JQU4TW|5.0|Beautiful and lyrical told with biting wit.  Hasn't lost any of it's power. It's a must read.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I prefer not to do a review on the technicalities of this product, believing that trying to appreciate everything through technology and numbers is a degeneration, equivalent to evaluating a woman by her measurements or a man by his wealth. However, I am driven to do one because of the overwhelming misinformation found here. I do a thorough research before ordering anything. Please do your own at Highdefdigest and [...] instead of relying on information on the box. This series is in 1080p. Find the \\"display\\" button on your TV remote and press it to find out about the video output. Mine says 1080p. The 5-disc set is the UK version. To straighten things up, there are at least three blu-ray versions for Planet Earth:    1. The BBC UK version. Five discs and in 1080p. Contains all the episodes from Planet Earth with none of the extras found on the DVD. The fifth disc contains two episodes from \\"Natural World\\" series: i. Desert Lions; ii. Snow Leopard. These two episodes are in 1080i. Narrator: David Attenborough. This version is available on Amazon UK ([...]).    2. The BBC US version. Four discs and in 1080p. Contains all the episodes from Planet Earth with none of the extras found on the DVD. Narrator: David Attenborough. This version is available here.    3. The Discovery version. Four discs and in 1080i. Contains all the episodes from Planet Earth with none of the extras found on the DVD. Narrator: Sigourney Weaver. This version is available on the Discovery website.    I got the BBC UK version from Amazon UK. With the dwindling pound (one of the few currencies that is doing worse than the dollar), price plus shipping is actually cheaper than if you had got it here. Ebay has it but at a higher price. My experience is always do a price research before getting anything there. There is no reason for anyone to get the Discovery version unless they absolutely must have Sigourney Weaver as the narrator. 1080p, 1080i, is there a great difference? No, but there is a noticeable difference. My wife and I noted a venetian blind effect [look up \\"interlaced\\" at Wikipedia] when viewing fast action on interlaced video. If you have good eyes, woe to you, you're stuck with progressive or learn to appreciate the beauty of the picture instead of its quality.    Finally, the series itself. The picture quality isn't the best I have seen on blu-ray but it is easily the most beautiful picture I have ever seen on a TV. The story, mind you there is one here, is more moving and philosophical than any crafted by human. I am an atheist but there is a moral behind the story that is hard to put your fingers on. There are numerous killing and preying in this documentary but they are all part of a larger picture. The moral is that the world we live in is benevolent, generous, and life-giving. For every animal killed, more thrives and prospers. Every death sustains the continuity of life and cannot be viewed as a tragedy. We all die one day to become part of the great cycle. The series also make me feel guilty as a human being for being over obsessed with my material needs. If you find the killing for the purpose of feeding in Planet Earth cruel, how much crueler are people who indulge in wasteful consumerism? We kill millions of animals each day by destroying their habitat to feed ourselves fatter, to get a second TV a second car, to upgrade our computer, to dress ourselves prettier, to buy ourselves into deeper debt.    I highly recommend this for children as an early education about life. If it didn't change your view on life you are missing something beyond the difference between 1080p and 1080i.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|As soon as I saw the preview for this I couldnt wait! Then the critics gave their opinion and they didnt care for it! I saw it anyways and it is non stop action through the whole movie! Most films like this one will have 1 or 2 action scenes then the rest is boring, but not this film! What a roller coaster, good script, good cast, amazing visual effects and it gives the affect that you are in the movie. I actually kept getting dizzy watching this in the theater and it wasent 3D or Imax! I can't wait to buy it! And I was sceptical at first about John Cusack in this movie but he did a decent job. Woody Harrelson has a small part he did good in as well.
B002BW7A58|3.0|Lil wayne, known for putting down flow on any mix any time anywhere freestyle.  This album on the contrary is overproduced with mixed vocals, guitar riffs, and Wayne trying to almost sound like Rancid.  I own all his stuff, from the underground droughts, to The Carter's and this is dissapointing.  Hard to get into, there's no flow!! JT MOney
B00004TS0E|5.0|I loved the original version with Natalie Wood, but think this up-to-date one is just as good as the orginal. I'm not as fond of black and white as some people, so, for me, the color really improved the story.
B0026P3G12|4.0|From the moment I saw Simon Cowell's eyebrows lift in surprise the first time he heard Susan Boyle sing, I looked forward to this CD.  Then when it finally came out and I looked at the song selections, I was disappointed.  Wild Horses?  Daydream Believer?  And while they are still not my favorite songs, the arrangements are well suited to her voice, slow and full of emotion.  For a woman with no formal training, and a CD that was, relatively speaking, quickly put together, this is very well done.  Her voice is pure and clear, simple but full.  Her version of You'll See is exceptionally good.  I'm sure you could nit pick on recording issues and other minor details until the cows came home, but for the average listener who just likes a pretty song sung well, this is it, in spades.  I so hope she does a holiday CD eventually.
B00005U8EM|5.0|Every Groundhog Day, I have to watch this movie (kind of like watching Christmas movies in December) and it never gets old.<br /><br />Phil Connors (Bill Murray [[ASIN:B000P0J07O Caddyshack]]) is a prima dona weatherman who is sent up to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, with his producer Rita (Andie MacDowell [[ASIN:B00000JRTX Four Weddings and a Funeral]]) and cameraman (Chris Elliott [[ASIN:B0006GANPA There's Something About Mary (Widescreen Edition)]]), for the Groundhog Day festival.  After being trapped in Punxsutawney during a blizzard, Connors begins to relive February 2nd over and over, for months.  Eventually, he has to face his outlook on life and learn to change.<br /><br />A very original and hilarious movie that I can watch over and over.  It has a deeper meaning, about living your life without being selfish and loving life at the same time.  Definitely recommend it.
B002TVQ4HG|4.0|After seeing this film, I decided to order the Blu-Ray, since it was really good in my opinion! It was really creepy and well acted and had some really good effects! If you have seen Dead Calm, Visitors and Ghost Ship and enjoyed those films, I believe that you will really enjoy this as well!
B00000JCB2|5.0|recieved in timely manner, case was broke but i got it for really cheap, so no big deal. thanks a bunch
B001AP11KW|5.0|I was very surprised to discover that I like this album every bit as much as CONSOLERS OF THE LONELY.  The dominant sentiment seems to be that CONSOLERS OF THE LONELY, their second album, is their breakthrough album.  I think this album is just as strong as that one.  I've been listening to it for long stretches on the road and progressively I've been sinking deeper and deeper into it.  I like every song but the stand out for me is \\"Broken Boy Soldier\\".  It has that raw, raspy rock blues twang to it that I just love.  Plus there is the tinkle of a triangle throughout that I think is the perfect counterpoint.  If one could put deep needle scratches into a groove on a CD, then this is the song which would be a mess on my album. My next favorite, which is beginning to give my first choice a run for the money is \\"Blue Veins\\" and for roughly the same reasons.  By contrast, I like the crowd pleaser favorite on this album, STEADY AS SHE GOES, but it is very harmonious and unraw so it is a bit too \\"nice\\" for me.  I do realize though that you have to have something for everyone and that is the song which won most polls (NPR for example).  The number one reason I bought this album was because Jack White is part of the band.  I haven't enjoyed a musician this much since the late Chet Baker was performing. He is an incredible talent.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00280LYIC|2.0|I bought the kindle version, and the publisher has opted out of the text to speech function that the kindle offers.  Unfortunately I bought all the books based on a friend's recommendation.  I will probably really enjoy them.  But there is no text to speech option.  Thanks Hyperion Books a subsidiary of Disney.  Disney is always at the leading edge of technology for people with disabilities.  And I am getting really tired of companies taking that away from books so that they can sell the audio version for 25 bucks.  Thanks for pilfering more money out from disabled people who have to pay for more expensive products that accomodate them.
B002HWUU1I|4.0|Maybe not as good as the first, Swell Season, but still very good--lively, touching, original--
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|as all the other this seasons, this as good if not better than the rest
B000GIXEIG|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie, thought it was much better and truer to the fable than all the others out there, including the most recent partially animated version with the big name stars.
B0035XMGXS|5.0|A new turn For NICK JONAS. his style is becoming more free, and the acoustical feel of his music is emerging through drums, stronger vocals, and  amazing guitar solos. This is his second solo album but his first since the Jonas Brothers rose to stardom. IT worth the buy if you like Stevie Wonder, Elvis Costello, Jonas Brothers, Hootie and the Blowfish, and John Mayer.ENJOY!
B000LC3ID8|4.0|Don't worry, my opinion for part two is coming soon. The weird part for me about this series is I don't like movies with torture-but this series has a demented cleverness to it that I didn't expect. The traps are sadistic but clever, the music is creepy, and Jigsaw's game in this one is something I admire-testing someone's capacity for forgiveness over revenge is a very interesting concept. When criminals go free it does make me angry, but hatred and revenge can have serious consequences, as this chapter demonstrates in gruesome detail. Kudos to Charles Clouser for the music score-I'm not sure even Jerry Goldsmith could've made a score this creepy. Special mention must be made to Tobin Bell as Jigsaw-what he does with his voice, making it raspy to the sound of a whisper was eerily effective,he gives me chills just hearing him talk, and his voice on his tapes are the same way. I'm not gonna lie though, a couple scenes/traps in this one did make me cringe, I look forward to part 5 though.    August 8, 2010  The main focus of this film is on Jigsaw's apprentice forcing a doctor to keep him alive while another test/game is taking place. These tests and traps are creepy to say the least-esp. the pig vat in the middle. I don't want the director's cut of this chapter because I saw the d's cut of the ending and decided I don't need it.  Now, do I think they should've ended the series here? Hell, No! Despite the ending, I'm glad the creators have come up with not just one but 5 decent sequels that connect like a puzzle. After this film though, Leigh Whannell and James Wan stepped aside as scriptwriters, but the replacements so far have done a very nice job in keeping the series interesting, however I wish Darren Lynn Bousman could've continued directing, but oh well.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|I was very pleased with my order it arrived before I expected it too. And everything was in good shape.  Thank you Amazon  Donnie Canada
B000VNMMQ6|1.0|this movie is actually good, the unrated version is off the mf hook! HOWEVER the blu ray that the studio delivers DOES NOT HAVE THE UNRATED VERSION THIS IS INCREDIBLY WACK!! HOW CAN YOU PUT THE UNRATED VERSION ON DVD BUT NOT ON THE BLU RAY THAT IS A BIG RIP OFF!!! WACK WACK WACK WACK WACK!!!
0525421033|3.0|My daughter is a voracious reader, and so after Christmas I decided to reward her hard work after the holidays by buying her four new books.  If I Stay, was one of those books.  Unfortunately,I have learned by experience that some books that are rated at \\"young adult\\" have content that might not be appropriate.  I have started reading books before giving them to her.  I felt that the subject matter was fine, a young person who while in a coma after an accident, views her life and seeks to make the decision if she is going to die or return to her life.  I became engaged with the accident victim, her family and friends.  Over all the writing was good and the voice clear.  My only problem with the book was the use of profanity in the book.  I have no idea why writers think that they have to use that type of language to get a point across.  Only once did I find it necessary at all, and that even could have been changed.  This would not have compromised the message of the book or it's impact.  I read this book right after another book that was twice as long and did not have any offending language at all and was a good read.    Is is too bad that I will not able to pass this book on to my daughter.  I think she would have enjoyed it.
B001TD1XWG|1.0|this cd is doooodoooo poooopoooo! wayne can barely hold your attention rappin so what was he thinking when he was doin this? you can say what you want and it dont matter if you are a die hard rap fan or rock fan THIS CD IS FARTHEAD MATERIAL ONLY FARTHEADS LISTEN TO THIS! wayne aint talkin bout NOTHIN as usual but to make it worse its over rock and roll beats which would be good if he had a real songwriter or something but it doesnt work here at all!. dont buy this people download it and listen to it and laugh at the attempt this guy made to crossover! ice t, cypress hill, and even outkast made an interesting effort crossing over from hip hop to other genres but this is not one of them, this is almost as worse as the black eyed peas trying to be pop singers now!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Supernatural is a great example of acting and writing at their best. The plot and characters are fully developed, there's plenty of action, and the actors work together very well. The show is simultaneously scary and smart, and the acting keeps everything feeling natural - the witty lines and quick comebacks don't sound like they're read straight from the script. As a fairly recent Supernatural fan, I've started watching the show from the beginning. As soon as I finished the 1st season I knew I wanted my own copy, and as I rewatch the episodes I can enjoy them just as much the second and third times as I did the first. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase, and I plan to buy the other seasons as soon as possible!
B002QGUFWE|4.0|She is very talented and has a great voice. My daughter loves this album and listens to it all the time. Great dance music.
B001HC7XCS|5.0|The language of the DVD is clearly printed in the Amazon description next to \\"Language\\". The picture also shows a different cover with Korean writing all over it. All the reviewers that are blaming the seller for upsetting their child, have no one to blame but themselves for being stupid and not looking before buying. Just my opinion.
0307269981|5.0|I have read \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tatto\\" and \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" and consider them both spellbinding reads.  Stieg Larsson is a superlative writer!  Too bad he died before writing many more.
B00243FQFA|5.0|Excellent show. I couldn't wait to get this dvd set and complete my collection. Definitely worth having.
B002Y7ZEMG|5.0|I have had the original VHS since I was BABY practically, and continue to watch it every often, even way BEFORE Michael passed. When I thought they would take advantage after he passed by releasing \\"past\\" movies and such, I assumed this would of been first, and too my surprise it wasn't even mentioned. I would like to believe this dvd is a \\"bootleg\\" but it seems to genuine and it has the appropriate details from the \\"Warner Bro's Studios\\", LOGOS, FBI Warning, the works, so its obviously legit. What I don't get is why the record company would release a \\"Michael Jackson\\" dvd in another country rather than his own, this DVD doesn't exist here in the U.S., unless its a bootleg. I am not complaining at all about the situation, I bought the last dvd \\"new\\" from this page for only $18.96, thats all...they will probably release and sell it for more in the U.S. soon, I hope, with extra footage of some sort. Even though there is a few Korean writings on the DVD BOX, its ALL in ENGLISH, and works PERFECTLY FINE with my REGION 1 DVD player. I noticed some buyers from another page \\"accidently\\" bought REGION 2, which doesn't work for the U.S. and U.K. So be very careful which \\"REGION\\" you buy, THIS VERSION was perfect and played crystal clear for me on my MAC and Home DVD player. GOOD LUCK TO ALL SEARCHING FOR THIS GREAT RARE ITEM!!!
B002SJIO5E|5.0|lots of special effects and the originality of this film make it a perfect Blu-ray candidate
B00140PK6O|5.0|The BBC always seem to be strong in the basics to make up a great production: Script, costume, set design and most of all GOOD ACTING. If you liked Pride and Prejudice produced by the BBC, then you'll want to get this also. There are themes of mercy and redemption.
B0026P3G12|5.0|What a beautiful voice Susan Boyle has. I listen to it when I am all stressed out and it calms me. I am so glad I bought it and would recommend it to anyone.
B002XGRSBI|5.0|The deluxe, four disc set is fantastic. The packaging, a hard back book with pictures, and the discs at the front and back is beautiful and practical. There are holes in the disc envelopes so you can get the discs out, unlike with the Beatles re-mastered boxed set cardboard disc envelopes.<br />The sound is fabulous on both CDs and DVS. The DVD is great for the full concert experience, to feel like you're there, as it includes most of his banter with the audience. The CDs are great when you want un-interrupted music.<br />My only wish is that there had been extra material from the other concerts in the same tour. I saw him in Halifax weeks before the New York concert, and while the set list was almost the same, in Halifax we also got Mull of Kyntire, and saw a girl get her arm signed on stage...so as a souvenir for someone at a similar concert it falls a bit short. Still, you certainly get your money's worth!
0553505408|5.0|I started the Jack Reacher series somewhere near the end.  After being bit by the bug, so to speak, I came back to the start and am proceeding to go through them all.  Lee Child has really got a good character going with \\"Reacher\\".
B001SAHOBO|1.0|I am VERY DISAPPOINTED in my DVD \\"Ip Man\\", first edition print, purchased from Amazon.  You truly need a quality rating on the various copies you are selling.  The quality of video on this (even though it is supposedly first edition print) is VERY POOR.    I would have gladly spent double to buy a really good print..this one is really unacceptable.    thanks for listening,    chris sutton

B00003CXB4|4.0|Excellent service.  Delivered on time as promised and in excellent condition.  Will make future purchases and recommend to others for their purchases.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I grew up watching the original Star Trek, and so approached this movie with great trepidation when it came out in the theatre.  Tampering with the original characters created so brilliantly by  Shatner, Nimoy, Kelley, Takei, Koenig, Nichols, and Doohan was a huge risk.   I went to the movie only because my kids wanted to go, not because I wanted to see it.  To my great surprise, the movie succeeds, and it succeeds big time  Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, and Karl Urban give performances that are not only true to those great characters, but give us something new in them: the dimension of youth.   They aren't just Kirk, Spock, & McCoy, but what you'd think they'd be 15 (earth) years earlier.  And I don't at all mean appearance.  It's how they talk, behave, and think that rings true.  Of all of them, Urban is especially on the mark. His youngish McCoy is not just a wonder to watch, but just plain fun.   Anton Yelchin gives us an enjoyable look at teen-age Chekov, also entirely believable.   True, the character of Sulu is not so memorable here (though not because John Cho's performance is off; he just doesn't have much to work with, plot-wise).  And, also, true, the characters of Uhura and Scotty are arguably the most divergent from the original characters, but they still \\"work\\" all right in the larger context of the movie.   It's the total movie that works well.  Eric Bana was all right as the bad guy, but the movie is not really about defeating the bad guy.  It's about the characters.   I bought the DVD as soon as it came out.
B002ZG997C|2.0|The Hughes Brothers, Allen and Albert, are not exactly the most prolific writing and directing team working in film. Their last film, \\"From Hell\\", is a criminally underrated and poorly timed release starring Johnny Depp and Heather Graham in an adaptation of a graphic novel about Jack the Ripper. It was released a few weeks after the 9/11 attacks and was all but ignored. Their new film, \\"The Book of Eli\\" is also based on a graphic novel. Despite a few interesting moments and a couple of good performances, the film is nowhere near as successful as their last effort. Given their track record, we have another seven or eight years to see if they hit the mark again.<br /><br />Eli (Denzel Washington) travels alone across a desolate landscape. As he rummages through abandoned and dilapidated homes and walks past the husks of rusted out cars, we quickly get the sense something bad has happened, something big that caused their way of life to change. As Eli makes his way west, we see he has two prized possessions. The first is an old IPOD he has jerry-rigged to a battery, to listen to music, to give himself an escape from the desolation around him. The second is a large leather bound book with a lock and a cross on the cover, a bible which he reads on a nightly basis. One day, he approaches a crumbling freeway interchange and watches as a group of motorcycle bandits quickly overtakes a man and a woman traveling together. They kill the man, take their possessions and begin to rape the woman. Eli watches, trying to decide if he should reach out, if he should get involved and help the woman. He decides to move on. Later, he comes to a town populated by a group of survivors and led by Carnegie (Gary Oldman). Carnegie lords over his people by controlling the food and water. He also provides alcohol drugs and women to the populous, operating out of a makeshift brothel carved out of an abandoned theater. Carnegie sends his teams out to scour the countryside looking for a book. When Eli arrives, he realizes the bike gang is in the bar and quickly takes them out with his sword and some fancy footwork. News travels to Carnegie and he wants to meet the new arrival. Carnegie wants Eli to work for him, to help him rebuild society. They are both survivors and know what life was like before the war thirty summers ago and they can both read. But Eli declines. Soon, Carnegie learns of Eli's bible, the very book he had been searching for. He sends Solara (Mila Kunis), the daughter of his companion (Jennifer Beals), a blind woman whom he adores, to visit Eli and spend the night with him. But Solara soon realizes Eli is different and might be able to help her escape. They reluctantly team up and continue west. But Carnegie isn't going to give up that quickly.<br /><br />When a film takes place in a different time or reality than our own, it has to work very hard to establish this landscape and to make us believe in everything that is happening. The filmmakers are extremely successful in one regard and less so in another. The landscape Eli travels is bleak, gray and desolate. As he walks through the gray, dressed in an old army jacket and a pair of wrap around sunglasses, nothing he passes looks like it was built recently and this fits extremely well with the back story we learn during the course of the film. A nuclear war happened thirty years ago and the survivors have been struggling to live ever since. People like Carnegie have power because he is able to control things like water and food. Most of the people surrounding people like Carnegie and Eli are younger and many have been born after the war. This means most are unable to read. Because of this, Carnegie realizes the power a bible might have and seeks to find a copy.<br /><br />When Eli first spots the lone couple pushing a shopping basket with all of their belongings, he stops and watches them. The bike gang quickly overtakes them, kills the man and rapes the woman. But Eli just watches from hisperch high above, tentatively reaching for his machete. He decides not to interact. Yet, later, he cautiously approaches a woman sitting on the ground next to her overturned shopping cart, apparently unable to move. Why is he reluctantly willing to help one and not the other? Later, Eli talks vaguely about his journey and it seems like he is on a quest. But how can we believe in his quest when he reluctantly agrees to help some, but not others. As we begin to learn more about the extent and meaning of Eli's journey, this double standard becomes even more troubling and problematic to the narrative.<br /><br />Denzel Washington is always good and as Eli he brings the right amount of seriousness and conviction to the role. We get he has a serious goal for his journey and he won't let anything stand in his way. When  he realizes the danger Carnegie presents, he simply walks away, trying to avoid further conflict. Of course, Carnegie can't let it end. When he has to help Solara, he does so reluctantly because it will impede his journey. But we get the sense that some part of his journey might be leading him to provide her with a hand.<br /><br />Washington is an extremely charismatic actor and he is just about always good, even when he appears in films that don't match his skill. Unfortunately, as one of the top stars in Hollywood, he continues to appear in films that don't match his skill. So for every film that reminds us why he is a star with great skill (\\"Crimson Tide\\", \\"American Gangster\\", \\"Devil in a Blue Dress\\"), he appears in an almost equal number of films that give us reason to question his skill (\\"D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu\\", \\"The Siege\\"). Washington clearly likes to work with the same people (he has appeared in a number of Tony Scott films (\\"Crimson Tide\\", \\"Man on Fire\\") but I have to wonder why he appears in so many films that don't live up to his ability. Is it the money? Is he anxious to make more films? If so, why doesn't he use his start power to make these problematic films better?<br /><br />Gary Oldman is good as Carnegie, the man who realizes the people, the few survivors, need to believe in something. He also realizes that if he possesses this, he will become more powerful and more legendary. He rules his kingdom with a quiet intensity. It is interesting to watch him interact with Claudia (Jennifer Beals), his blind lover. When the motorcycle gang brings back some shampoo, he eagerly uses it to wash Claudia's hair, thrilled to provide her with the luxury. But when he sees an obstacle in his way, he has no qualms about ordering his men to remove the barrier.<br /><br />Mila Kunis is less interesting as Solara. Carnegie initially orders her to spend the night with Eli and she is clearly not used to fulfilling such requests. But when she realizes Eli is not interested, she pleads with him to simply let her stay the night. If she is sent away, Carnegie won't like it and she will have trouble. Later, when they begin the quest, Kunis seems to be simply moving her character through the emotions. She is unable to really make us believe she shares the same intensity as Eli.<br /><br />Ray Stevenson (HBO's \\"Rome\\", \\"The Punisher: War Zone\\") plays Carnegie's security. Stevenson is always interesting to watch, he has a certain intensity about him which causes us to watch him, even when he is saying mundane things or unable to contribute to the narrative.<br /><br />There are a couple of interesting action scenes. Early on, Eli is confronted by a motley band of survivors who are looking to score something to eat (cannibalism seems to be common in this time). He gives them a chance, informing them if they continue they won't survive. They laugh and confront him. Eli moves under an old overpass and the entire fight happens in darkness, we are only able to see their silhouettes. He quickly dispatches the group, beheading more than a few of the attackers. In fact, this one scene has more beheadings than I have ever seen in a singlefilm before. The scene is interesting visually and there are a couple of moments like this. But the rest of the film concerns Eli's slow journey across a barren landscape. It feels a bit like someone touched a fast forward button (for the fight scenes) a few times while watching a DVD of the rest of the film.<br /><br />There is a final \\"ah huh\\" moment. And it is interesting, but it unfortunately raises more questions and starts to make the viewer look more closely at the rest of the narrative, trying to spot any other problems, holes and poorly constructed bits. When this happens, the film has to be air tight, to withstand such scrutiny.<br /><br />And \\"The Book of Eli\\" isn't.Carnegie, the man who realizes the people, the few survivors, need to believe in something.

B0000062GK|3.0|Proves yet once again that the old saying \\"less is more\\" holds true.  This could've been a 2 album release.  Had 5 weakest songs been taken out, it would've been a much better album.  As it is, I give it a 3.  Not groundbreaking, nor revolutionary, nor too exciting, but for $6.99 it's just fine.
B0034JKZ86|4.0|I don't understand why people complain about the lack of good family fair and then shy away from going to see \\"The Princess and the Frog\\", the new traditionally animated film from Disney. This is a good film and the lack of business it is creating may cause Disney to rethink their current change in course.<br /><br />A few years ago, John Lasseter, the force behind all of the Pixar hits, was promoted to oversee many different aspects of Disney. He did something I don't think a lot of people expected. He restarted production of traditionally animated, hand drawn feature films, a type of filmmaking all but abandoned (due to cost; computer animation is a lot cheaper) at a studio now making digital animation. He hired the team behind \\"The Little Mermaid\\" and they chose to make \\"The Princess and the Frog\\", the first Disney film featuring an African American heroine.<br /><br />New Orleans, the 20s. Tiana (Anika Nani Rose, \\"Dreamgirls\\", \\"The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency\\") is a practical girl. As a child, she accompanies her mom (Oprah Winfrey) when she goes to Big Daddy's House (John Goodman) to make a dress for his daughter, Charlotte. Tiana and Charlotte are best friends and listen enraptured as Tiana's mom tells them the story of \\"The Frog Prince\\". Charlotte immediately announces she will kiss every frog and find her prince, but Tiana can't stomach the thought of kissing a frog. Tiana also shares her hard working dad's (Terrence Howard) dream of opening a restaurant. Flash forward ten years and we rejoin Tiana as she works multiple jobs trying to save enough money to open her first restaurant. She wants to keep her dad's dream alive and has found a spot she knows will be perfect, an abandoned waterfront warehouse. Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos, lots of parts on TV shows), the prince of Moldavia, arrives in town with his aide, Lawrence. Naveen wants to play jazz and has all but given up his ties to the throne of his country. A witch doctor, Dr. Facilier (Keith David) spots an opportunity. If he gets Charlotte to marry a fake Prince Naveen, he can take over Big Daddy's fortune. But first, he has to turn the prince into a frog and find a replacement to play Prince Naveen. Charlotte hears of the prince's arrival and gets her dad to throw a costume ball during Mardi Gras. Big Daddy is only too happy to oblige for two reasons; he has been chosen the King of Mardi Gras again and anything his Charlotte wants, she gets. Throw in Louis, an alligator who also wants to play jazz and Ray, a wise Cajun firefly and everything starts to get complicated.<br /><br />Written and directed by Ron Clements and John Musker, the team behind \\"The Little Mermaid\\", \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" bnngs the same sort of magic and beauty back to the silver screen.<br /><br />There are a lot of things to like and celebrate about \\"The Princess and the Frog\\".  The animation style seems almost romantic, in a way, perhaps because it has been so long since we have seen this type of animation used to any great extent. It also allows the film to look softer, almost as though it is glowing, which helps evoke the rose colored portrait of New Orleans the film puts forth. Everything about the film helps to give a romanticized vision of the great city and it is nice to see this celebrated.<br /><br />One of the best and most consistent things about Disney animation is the music. In a time when there were virtually no other musicals being created, Disney Animated features continued the legacy, allowing some of the best and brightest performers, composers and writers to work, to continue their craft. In the last few years, live action musicals have started to enjoy a small renaissance at a time when animated features began to cycle away from using music. In \\"Princess\\", each song seems to celebrate a different kind of music which is fitting and a great idea as New Orleans is also a melting pot of music. In this way, the filmmakers celebrate and pay tribute to all of the different musical influences of this city, zydeco, ragtime, jazz, Cajun and more.<br /><br />The characters are all funny, memorable and interesting. A few years ago, someone in the Disney Marketing Machine came up with the idea of marketing all of the \\"Princesses\\" from the different films plastering their pictures on every conceivable piece of merchandise. Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Jasmine, Belle, Snow White and the Little Mermaid are extremely popular so putting them all together is an even bigger draw for the millions of little girls who snap up their merchandise. So, any new animated film with a Princess is going to be considered a boon to the ongoing marketing machine that is Disney. Add Tiana to the group and everything can be redesigned, remade and resold. But Tiana is also the first African-American princess providing even more attractive marketing possibilities. She is a great marketing tool. When you become a fan of Disney, you quickly realize that everything in the kingdom is about marketing: if a film is a success, the characters go on to live in television, theme park rides & attractions, video games, clothing, DVDs, costumes and so much more. When you realize this, you can quickly move on and allow the films to create memories and magic. And Tiana is a very good addition to the Disney family.<br /><br />Tiana is head strong, independent, goal-oriented and very busy. From her early days, listening to her dad talk about his dreams of opening a restaurant, she quickly adopted the same dreams. Now that he has gone on, she continues to press forward, working two jobs, saving every penny for a down payment. Only when the two men who promised to sell her an abandoned warehouse for her restaurant threaten to pull out, does she become desperate and start to look for some more money. Early on, Tiana brings her mom to the space and they sing a song about what the restaurant will become. Throughout this number, there are references to the sacrifices the young woman has made and it becomes a celebration but also a poignant illustration of this character's strong will.<br /><br />Anika Nani Rose is very good as the voice of Tiana, giving her a lot of energy, a lot of pluck and a lot of intelligence. When Tiana meets the Frog Prince at Charlotte's house, she is reluctant to believe the talking frog, but her need for financial help gives her the little push she needs. She reluctantly bends down to give him a smooch<br /><br />Bruno Campos is good as Naveen, providing a soft accent for his character. But he is unremarkable. So many others could have done the role, his performance isn't distinctive enough.<br /><br />Keith David is fantastic as the voice of Dr. Facilier, the witch doctor who hatches a plan to steal Big Daddy's fortune. His big musical number helps to illustrate his connection to the dark arts of voodoo. His character brings to mind some of the elements of Jafar from \\"Aladdin\\" and his number brings back memories of Oogie Boogie in \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\".<br /><br />As \\"Frog\\" is a Disney animated film, there are talking animals. When Naveen is turned into a frog, he talks and Tiana understands him. Later, they meet Louis, an alligator who just wants to play music for people. Voiced by Michael Leon-Wooley, the character is funny and fun to watch, especially every time he tries to sneak into a jazz band and begin to play, trying to remain unnoticed.<br /><br />Ray, a Cajun firefly, has been dubbed the Cajun Jiminy Cricket. I guess there is a little truth to that. Ray is the guide for Tiana, Naveen and Louis, helping them navigate their way out of the swamp and back to New Orleans. Voiced by Jim Cummings, Ray is funny and touching.<br /><br />While in the swamp, the team decides to try to get Mama Odie to help them. Odie is a Cajun woman who lives in the heart of the Bayou with her pet python and is basically the good counterpart to Doctor Facilier. Voiced by Jennifer Lewis (the original \\"Dreamgirls\\"), she provides a couple of funny moments and even some sage advice.<br /><br />John Goodman is also very good as Big Daddy. A New Orleans native, he clearly understands and has met people similar to Big Daddy.<br /><br />I am only touching the barebones of the story. There are a number of twists and turns that should even keep the adults entertained. In fact, it might be a little too complicated for most kids.

0738710261|5.0|is the oldest of the tarot decks -- i like that the minor arcana does not have illustrations..(especially ones dreamed up by a bunch of magick lodge members)..the mini deck fits very well on my lap desk and i am finding renewed interest in working with the tarot..
1439163855|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book. There were a lot of great twists and turns and it really had me thinking about what is morally right vs. what your gut tells you is right. I didn't like the books ending though. I preferred the movie ending.
0525457585|5.0|I was uncertain about buying this book since the movie had disappointed me, but now I am SO GLAD that I did so.  This story is much better than the snippet portrayed inthe film and it reminded me of Narnia and the Phantom tollbooth combined.  This is the kind of faerie tale that we need, for children and adults alike.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|i've always been a fan of MJ...and was completly devastated when i learned of his death on 6/25/09, along with the rest of the world.  i was so looking forward to his come-back concerts in london, even though, i wasn't going.  i knew they would be a huge success, and was hoping he would decide to do something similar in the US so i could have a chance to watch true genius at work.<br /><br />i just received the DVD for my b-day, and must say...the rumors that he was ill or didn't have it anymore just aren't true.  his voice sounds just like it does on the recordings, even when he holds back to warm up his voice, and his moves...still classic with some new ones thrown in there.  i mean, he really does keep up with dancers half his age!  yeah, there were times he might not have gone \\"full-out\\" in every rehearsal, but anyone who has performed knows that happens with rehearsals.  however, you can tell he was putting his entire heart and soul into this show.<br /><br />i'm so thankful all the hours were shot, and it was edited into the final product.  many thanks to the jackson family, as well, for allowing this last bit of MJ to be shared with the world.  it not only solidifies his status as the \\"king of pop\\", and shows off how fantastic of an entertainer he was, but also provides a glimpse into MJ as a fellow man...a loving and talented man.<br /><br />some of my favorite songs highlighted:  \\"smooth criminal\\", \\"i just can't stop loving you\\", \\"thriller\\", \\"human nature\\", \\"earth song\\", and \\"billie jean\\".  i haven't gotten through all of the special features, but \\"memories of michael jackson\\" and the one about the dance auditions were quite enjoyable and entertaining.
B002VPE1AW|4.0|The visual effects and technology in this movie are stunning.  The 3-D is there, but never gets into your face.  It's the first movie I've seen in a long time that truly conveys a sense of wonder.  James Cameron can really direct and boy! can he put a movie together!  It is worth the price.  You simply must see this in a theater, preferably at an IMAX, but definitely in 3-D.  This movie is going to change the way movies are made, permanently, but will not survive the transition to Blu-Ray or DVD.  It won't be the same, and the magic will be gone without the 3-D and big screen experience , because...    James Cameron can direct brilliantly.  He can create stunning visual images.  He can deliver a fantastic movie, with all the money right up there on the screen.  What he couldn't do is write a whole new story all by himself.      This is a flawed masterpiece.  The story is eminently predictable, full of cliches and you've seen all this before. The incredible magic he's created will carry you 3/4 of the way though the film, and you'll still enjoy the rest in spite of the heavy-handed sermonizing, but essentially this movie is Dances with Wolves meets Apocalypse Now with a bit of Star Wars for seasoning (just substitute the words \\"The Force\\" for \\"Eywa\\").       Cameron says there will be a sequel.  I hope not, because by the time it comes out other films will have duplicated this technology, and it will have to survive on story, for which he'll need some really good writers.  Leave it where it is.    If course, maybe he could make it a really short sequel, which unfortunately could show the problem of relying on Eywa to save the day against greedy people who have the technology to travel faster than light.  The sequel could be based on a line from one of his other brilliant films.  All you'd have to do is pick up from the end of Avatar. The Earthmen are in the shuttle and the engines are winding up.  One of the bigwigs turns to another and says,     \\"I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit. It's the only way to be sure\\"
B000VDDDY6|1.0|I cannot believe how people are being fooled by this gimmick. This new \\"re-mastered\\" version of the original series is a travesty. I watched season one just to see what the differences are, and I was beside myself with anger. Not only have they changed the original special effects- but even the classic theme music has been hijacked and re-recorded. On top of that, the dvds come in cheap, double sided discs. Every dvd collector knows that these are less quality than the single sided ones.      How does this abomination be let to stand? I can only think of younger people who have never seen the original series putting this on and thinking that this was Star Trek. They have all been hoodwinked by greedy entertainment executives trying to make a fast buck at the expense of American television history. To destroy and subvert such a classic show as Star Trek is just beyond me. CGI is destroying American cinema as it is (who out there can tell me honestly that the effects in Michael Bay's Transformers looked more realistic that the live action models used in the original Star Wars movies?), and to use that to alter the special effects here under the pretense that they are \\"improving\\" the originals is ludicrous. The new CGI effects look like CGI EFFECTS. And that is a far cry from looking realistic. Special effects looked better, and more realistic decades ago and have been regressing- not improving with the new technologies. A large part of Star Trek's charm was the style it was made in- from the primitive (but effective) special effects used, to the period sets and odd fashion sense, and the iconic theme music. All of these things have been soiled in some way by this new \\"re-mastering\\" and Star Trek fans should not stand for it. Write the producers behind this desecration in protest and seek out the original now out of print 2004 releases which preserved this great show as it should always be- un-edited, un-altered, and most definitely not \\"re-mastered\\".
0156027321|4.0|The Life of Pi is a wonderfully engrossing tale of a vibrant young Indian teen named Piscine Molitor Patel(nicknamed Pi). As a young teen living in India, Pi had sought and found acceptance in the different religious philosophies of Hinduism, Islan, and Catholicism.      The adventure begins when Pi and his family leave India to set sail for Canada aboard a Japanese cargo ship.   After said ship sinks in a violent storm, Pi is the one surviving person in a large lifeboat and he has for company in the lifeboat an injured zebra, an orangutan, a hyena, and a Bengal tiger.        The journey in the the open sea becomes a test of his will to live and combat his fear of dying.  At the same time, Pi witnesses firsthand the struggles of predator and prey, it is truly survival of the fittest.  Soon, he and the tiger are the only ones left and Pi resolves he must find the means and will to survive.      This story is a wonderful insight into human nature, the instinct for survival and the philosophy of rekigion and faith. The story contains no romance or mystery but it is a exciting adventure story.  One will discover that Yann Martel's allegorical story correlates to most life situations as he draws upon the parallel behaviors of both animal and humans.  Very highly recommended.

0553801503|1.0|Robert Jordan (Wheel of Time), Terry Goodkind (Sword of Truth),  and Martin (A Song of Ice and Fire) were born all in 1948.  All of them started with promising groundbreaking epic fantasy stories in the nineties (Eye of the World: 1990, Wizards First Rule: 1994, Game of Thrones: 1996).  And unfortunately all started to lose control of their story circa book four of their series.  And guess what? The complaints were always the same: MOVE THE PLOTLINE ALREADY!      Length can be forgiven as long as there is meaningful plot development.  It's about the story; not the world.
B002RSDW80|3.0|While entertaining and sometimes funny, this film wasn't as great as its hype.  Streep's performance was wonderful, nailing Julia's vocal style as well as her stature.  She stole the spotlight from everyone else in the film.  In fact, the engaging plot lay in the flashbacks featuring Streep and Tucci, who was also great in this underwhelming film.  A confessed foodie, I was thrilled with the story from the standpoint of the modern take on Julia and her creations.  I really wanted to be engrossed in Julie, but her pathetic whining never culminated in anything for me.  She just eventually became a successful whiner.  I didn't feel any life in Adams' performance; thus, found myself hoping her scenes would hurry by to get to more Julia.  Alas, the film crept on and never really felt like it ended.  The buildup of the story would have had more impact if it had ended about 30 minutes sooner, at the point of Julie's success.  Instead, it meandered.  If you want insight into Julia's life, this film is great and humorous.  Otherwise, skip it.

Having seen Bowie with Tin Machine and on the Glass Spider / Sound + Vision tours, you become accustomed to top flight productions.  But, did this all translate to a CD?  The simple answer is 'yes.'  A couple of songs were dropped for the European tour, such as Let's Dance and Modern Love, but otherwise its exactly as I remember.  At the moment, it could be argued that this CD captures Bowie's swan song as his retirment and seclusion appear complete.  After all, it was a heart attack that cut the tour short never to be finished.  So, crank it up and enjoy the memories.

B002T9H2L0|5.0|But I always round up. A great effort by Tarantino. Espectially \\"Chapter One.\\" Never have I seen menace so convincingly conveyed with a polite smile. Why minus a half star? Brad Pitt. His performance was one of the few flaws in this film. Tarantino once again displays his superb ear for dialogue. This film was not at all what I expected - and I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't.
B002U6CJCE|5.0|'Universal Soldier: Regeneration' finds an aging Luc Deveraux (Van Damme) struggling through behavioral therapy while a scientist sells the UNISOL technology to a terroist group. Helmed by first time director John Hyams, son of director Peter Hyams (timecop, Sudden Death). In this installment, you really get a sense the level of complication that would arise from the events of the first film, both emotionally and socially. \\"Soldier gets killed in war, body frozen for twenty years only to be brought back to life as a weapon, etc etc.\\" Apparently because the second sequel was so bad and the direction the writer's took Luc Deveraux's character being ridiculous, this one pretty much ignores it. Which really, really works. Van Damme brought kickboxing to America, or at least to Hollywood and while he's always choreographed his own fight scenes; this one takes the cake(and at nearly 50!) The final battle between Lundgren and Jean-Claude here is one of the most brutal, raw, hands down best in years! If it weren't for nostalgia, I'd say this was better than the original...

B0030BYWKK|4.0|For a band as entirely oblivious to the whims of their fans as Midlake, it should come as no surprise that The Courage of Others again redefines the band's sound with barely a nod at what came before. Like their breakthrough record The Trials of Van Occupanther was a near-180 from the psychedelic rock of their debut Bamnam and Slivercork, their latest takes four years of incubating the rustic influences of artists as varied as Nick Drake and Pentangle and turns it into a strangely hypnotic album, one that is as different from what came before as it is likely to differ from whatever follows. It's easy to pin down the foundations that The Courage of Others is built upon, but it's far more difficult to realize whether Midlake has succeeded in distilling their own version of it all.<br /><br />On the surface there seems plenty to like here for fans of Van Occupanther, but it quickly becomes apparent that the pop heart clearly present in past tunes like that record's \\"Young Bride\\" or \\"Bandits\\" has been tossed away in favor of a much more focused, much less accessible sound. Singer Tim Smith's distinct vocals run the show here, painting a portrait of past times and reviving the ghosts of `60s-`70s folk-rock with the uncanny ease of a weathered listener, and the band's traditionally countrified sound takes things one step further here. The album art should give anyone a pretty good indication of what's to come: Druidic rituals set to music, the worshipping of nature and living by the land, bucolic guitars weaving languid lines out and about around the omnipresent flutes and mournful, multi-tracked vocals.<br /><br />It's not something to be taken lightly, and at times the experience can drag as such an utter dedication to a sound can tend to do. Van Occupanther succeeded because of its rich array of sonic textures that still managed to hearken back to an overall sound, a feel for the album that gave it a classic identity. The Courage of Others without a doubt has just such a unique identity, likely even stronger than what came before, but at times this comes at the expense of dragging, as when songs like \\"Small Mountain\\" and \\"Rulers, Ruling All Things\\" might overwhelm with the dourness of it all.<br /><br />But it's the wholehearted attention to detail, the relentless pursuit of a tranquil sound meant to transport the listener straight back into the Appalachian woods, this kind of headphones album that makes The Courage of Others a decidedly experimental sort of success. It's uplifting to hear the softly flowing harmonies of a song like \\"Fortune,\\" the anthemic climax to \\"Children of the Grounds\\" or the heartrendingly frank truths on the titular track. Midlake have shown again and again that they are a band not resistant to change but guided by it, always refining and redirecting their sounds as they see fit; after all, this is a band firmly situated in 1972 via 1821. It's the kind of forward thinking that should be praised more often than not, and while they would be advised to cut back on the flutes next go-around, The Courage of Others is a challenging and altogether rewarding experience.ity, likely even stronger than what came before, but at times this comes at the expense of dragging, as when songs like \\"Small Mountain\\" and \\"Rulers, Ruling All Things\\" might overwhelm with the dourness of it all.

0340733748|5.0|After publishing three books with George Smiley (GS) in a major or minor role, and one spy novel without him (\\"A Small Town in Germany\\"), John Le Carré (JLC) produced the monumental \\"Karla\\"-trilogy with GS as the undisputed hero.   This volume, first published in 1974, is Part One of the trilogy and in this reviewer's opinion JLC's very best creation among many other masterpieces. The principal theme in the book is the search for a \\"mole\\", an inside man turned traitor, within the higher echelons of the Circus, which runs some 600 agents worldwide. There have been inexplicable failures and disappointments. Control, the nameless head of the Circus is becoming suspicious of all of his staff, at a time when his health is also declining rapidly. He becomes an increasingly marginalised person, poring over piles and piles of files, when a new source managed by a man keen to take Control's place, begins to enthral Whitehall with high quality reports...  Suddenly brought out of retirement, GS attends the debriefing of a blown field agent and is requested to pursue the outcome of the interview. In utter secrecy, GS starts his campaign to find the mole, aided by the trusted Peter Guillam and Retired Inspector (Special Branch) Mendel, who appeared first in JLC's debut \\"Call for the Dead\\".  What makes this book exceptional is its plot, its dialogues, its atmosphere and more than ever, its characters.  Chapter One about unhappy public schoolboy Bill \\"Jumbo\\" Roach meeting ex-betrayed spy, shot in the back, Jim \\"Rhino\\" Prideaux, ranks among the best first chapters in spy novels, on par with Trevanian's opening of \\"The Loo Sanction\\". Totally brilliant.

0684824906|5.0|As others have said, this is a very detailed, engrossing account of the Lincoln years.  Obviously, Goodwin did tons of research, and one marvels at her ability to provide such detail when describing day-to-day events that occurred 150 years ago.  The book deserves the the high praise it gets in the reviews here.<br /><br />One thing that struck me was the unimaginable tragedy people of that era had to endure due to the primitive medical resources at the time.  The loss of spouses and children to illness was horrifically commonplace back then.  This affected people from all walks of life, and Lincoln and his cabinet were no exception.  I can barely fathom how these men were able to suffer these awful losses and still find the inner strength to carry on and shoulder the heavy responsibilities of running the country.<br /><br />One small criticism I have of the book is that at times it verges on hagiography.  The way Goodwin tells it, it seems like every decision made by Lincoln is a wise one, every political strategy of his is brilliant, every word spoken by him evidence of his magnanimity and greatness.  Sure, Lincoln was perhaps the greatest leader this country has ever produced, and if anyone was close to being so superhuman, it may have been him.  Still, a more critical, nuanced analysis of his presidency would have made the overall portrait ring truer and helped us develop a more complete understanding of the man.
0765350386|5.0|I can honestly say this is one of, if not THE, best fantasy novels I've ever read. I'm hoping the 3rd book in this series, based on reviews, will outdo it. Brandon Sanderson is an incredible writer who expertly develops characters to their full potential. His storyline and plot twists prove to be continuously interesting and exciting. While this novel definitely can stand alone, I love the idea of reading more novels based in this world. I only wish there were more than 3. I can definitely recommend this novel to anyone even marginally interested in fantasy. You won't be disappointed.

B002Q9MZF6|5.0|Kudos definitely to all concerned in the production of this program, for making a very modern movie, but still keeping it largely within the framework of the original story.  So many stage directors are doing wild and wacky things these days with time periods, scenery and clothing (want to hear about a Don Giovanni where the Commendatore comes out of the trunk of a Mercedes?)that I am glad that Mr. Dornhelm resisted temptation and kept this La Boheme in it's correct period. You cannot deny that the camera loves Anna, or yes, that Rolando LOVES the camera, but their voices are absolutely thrilling and touching in the right places.  On the Blu-ray, I agree with the reviewer from Blu-ray.com about the picture quality, particularly as the colors of Musetta's gown just leap off the screen.  As for the complaints before about lip-syncing, they've been doing that in movie musicals for years folks,  from South Pacific to Grease to Nine, and in opera films like Domingo and Julia Migenes in Carmen.  As for the reviewer from Australia who didn't like the picture quality, perhaps it's a region coding problem.  No complaints here.

B002TYZKIM|3.0|\\"This Is It\\" was, of course, the name of what was to be Michael Jackson's comeback/farewell concert tour, fifty shows at London's O2 arena beginning in July 2009. Jackson's death on June 25th left his fans without a final act in his roller-coaster career and did nothing to quell speculation in the press about Jackson's health. \\"Michael Jackson's This Is It\\", the movie, is an attempt to give fans what little is available of the aborted concert extravaganza and to reassure the public that Jackson was fit and ready to put on some great shows at the age of 50. In these things, \\"This Is It\\" succeeds marginally, but the documentary does little to entertain.<br /><br />Inexplicably, \\"This Is It\\" begins with a brief look at dance auditions in April 2009 then skips to late in the rehearsal schedule, when there is little left to do except decamp for London and full dress rehearsals there. I'm sure that the filmmakers wanted to give viewers as much of Michael Jackson's performance as they could while sparing us tedious early rehearsals, but they might have spared us the soundbites of overwrought dancers as well. What we get is an awkward combination of sub-standard performance footage and a behind-the-scenes look into creating the film footage that was to be used on a huge 3-D LED screen behind the stage.<br /><br />There were to be at least four major pieces of film content for the LED screen, whose 3-D feature made it possible for characters to move from the screen to the live stage, an innovation that would have been seen for the first time onstage in London. We can't see that, but we do get much of the final film content that concertgoers would have seen. That is where \\"This Is It\\" excels: It gives the viewer a pretty good idea of what these concerts would have looked like. And they would have been a success. Though I'm not convinced Jackson could have done 50 shows, he clearly intended to give his fans their money's worth in glamour, pyrotechnics, dance, and multimedia.<br /><br />But \\"This Is It\\" disappoints in its footage of Michael Jackson. We see rehearsals of the major musical performances, but Jackson is saving his voice and his body for the tour. Some of his vocals seem to be dubbed in from other recordings. He goes through the dance steps to get the blocking right, but he doesn't put much energy into it. Though he is fit and prepared, he's not really giving a performance in these clips, and he says very little between sets. Because \\"This Is It\\" has chosen to feature Jackson's performance as much as possible, we don't get any commentary on the concert preparations. For that, watch \\"Staging the Return\\" and \\"The Gloved One\\" in the DVD bonus features, which offer additional details on the concert's artistry.<br /><br />The DVD (Sony 2010): \\"Staging the Return\\" (40 min) interviews the creative team and producers about planning and preparing for the concerts. Unlike the film, these interviews were recorded after Jackson's death, so they have more perspective. They're also a chance for these people to tell the world about all the spectacular stuff they created for the concerts that no one will ever get to see. \\"The Gloved One\\" (15 min) focuses on Jackson's costumes. Designer Zaldy shows us the 7 outfits he created for Jackson in some detail. In \\"Memories of Michael\\" (16 min), Jackson's creative and business partners share their memories of the man. \\"Auditions: Searching for the World's Best Dancers\\" (10 min) give us a peek at the dance auditions in Los Angeles.

B002SB2AAM|1.0|So he is following a formula and it gets annoying after a while. I am on the last minutes of 14th CD and I doubt I can bring myself to finish it.  It is repetitive, outlandish, highly interpretive, and too predictable. So the trivia is of interest however nothing I cannot get off a Snapple cap. I was surprised once in 14 cds. I enjoyed The Da Vinci Code and to a lesser extent Angels and Demons this one is one too many. I realize that I am a minority considering the success of the book however this must be a combination of marketing, first time Dan Brown readers  who should enjoy the genre, and hype. I wish Mr. Brown finds another theme as this gold vein has been mined to the extreme.

B000FVNX2Q|1.0|This was a breakthrough financial calculator when it was released in the early 1980s. They have improved on the original version mainly by making it much faster and making the digits go to 10 places. There are MANY financial calculators, including from HP, which are just as capable and but are much cheaper. HP can charge higher price of this calculator because it has reached an iconic \\"THE financial calculator\\" status and because so many  financial professionals use it and most of them do not want to bother learning to use an another calculator. So if cost is a concern, then I do not recommend this calculator.<br /><br />This calculator, along with TI BA II Plus Professional, are the only two calculators allowed for the CFA exam. So if you are studying for your CFA, you will need to practice with one of the two. I have both calculators and they are both excellent choices. Some say HP 12C is better because of RPN and it requires fewer keystrokes. True, but that advantage is negated by HP 12c's fewer buttons and since each button must perform 3 separate functions, one may occasionally punch more buttons to perform the same calculations on HP 12C than on TI BA II Plus Pro. HP 12C Platinum is just as fast in financial calculations as BA II Plus Pro. The TI BA II Plus Pro, however, is just as effective at half the cost. The main advantage of HP 12C is its RPN capability and the \\"The financial calculator\\" factor. It is also smaller than TI BA II Plus Pro.<br /><br />This calculator performs most of the statistics functions which are largely done using Excel (or its equivalent) these days. Its statistics functions are lacking a Z table. Most scientific calculators have a Z table but not business calculators. So if you are looking for a true statistics calculator, then I recommend a scientific calculator that allows data entry and a large screen size such as HP 50g.<br /><br />**ADDENDUM**<br /><br />I have used this calculator for almost 2 years. This calculator has serious durability problems. First, the screen scratches VERY easily. But that is not the biggest problem, the all-important ENTER(=) key only registers my entries about 80% of the time. Pressing the key harder does not help. That one flaw makes this calculator very unreliable as I need to double-check all my entries as I am making calculations. To those who are using this calculator during an intense (and often difficult) finance exams, that could be a serious flaw. I have decided to dump this very expensive calculator for a cheaper alternative. I am very disappointed with this purchase. That's too bad, because whent this calculator works, there are few, if any, like it.the screen scratches VERY easily.

B000FBFN0Q|1.0|The main character is so annoying!!  Rebecca is an immature, compulsive liar who thinks it is okay to put herself in debt and then attempt to win the lottery, marry a millionaire, or just hide from the world.  At one point, she tells her parents (and for some crazy reason they actually believe her) that the man who works at the bank (and is trying to collect on her debt) is actually stalking her, so if he calls, they should tell him they do not know where she is.  Is this person for real?  Ironically (but not really) this moron Rebecca somehow writes for a financial magazine, although she hates her job and, as a result, works as little as possible.  She readily admits that she knows nothing about what she writes and is basically just summarizing other people's work.  Despite all of this, somehow, by the end of the novel, she becomes a FINANCIAL EXPERT and is asked to become a regular on a morning talk show giving people advice about their finances.  I'M NOT KIDDING.  Oh, and another thing, two of the wealthiest men in Britain want her, but in the end she does not need their money because she's now making more than enough with the television network.  She winds up (predictably) with the millionaire who she fights with for much of the novel.
078513915X|2.0|My wife brought this home and said she loved it.  I, however, must dump on it.<br /><br />Look, I don't mind comic-book reimaginings of classic stories.  Eric Shanower's version of \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" as an example, was welcomed in most quarters.<br /><br />But Austen simply isn't fitting material for this.  There's very little action.  It's almost all verbal:  just a bunch of heads sitting around talking, talking, talking.  None of the cool stuff you can do in comics is done here, simply because the material doesn't call for it.  Whose idea was this?  Hey, Marvel, why not a comics version of Augustine's \\"City of God\\"?<br /><br />Plus, it wasn't my impression from reading Austen's novel that the five Bennett sisters were a clutch of tawdry trollops.  But that's how they're drawn here.  Frankly, they've been rendered like adult film stars.  It's really off-putting.<br /><br />Lovely colors, though.
B002WY65W4|5.0|I have always been a fan of the zombie genre so this one was pretty easy for me to like. What's great about this movie however is that it is a big hit with people who aren't in to the horror/zombie genre. Without a doubt I can easily call this an instant classic from the decade. I have no problems recommending this to movie fanatics/collectors of all types, especially those who enjoy comedy or horror. It's a great blend without feeling slapstick (which I hate). This is probably the shortest review I have ever written about anything, because honestly the movie speaks for itself, it's great.
B00139W3NE|3.0|I say \\"shame,\\" because I'm afraid the poor performance of this movie will get you to not read the series of 3 books it's based on (this film is an adaption of the first).  Not reading those books would be a tremendous loss.<br /><br />And I think you'd have to read \\"The Golden Compass\\" to understand why the reason the movie didn't do better.  It wasn't a problem with the director or the actors or anything.  Rather, the book interwove two emotions:  fear and wonder, with wonder being uppermost.  The movie, for the most part a faithful adapation, also interwove the same two emotions, but with fear uppermost, and wonder taking a back seat.<br /><br />It's just one scene after another of relentless, pounding fear.  Kids don't dig that so much.
045122499X|3.0|I was pleasantly surprised to find \\"World Without End\\" in my local store, having no idea that a \\"sequel\\" to my favorite book had even been written. I found WWE to be quite similar to \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\" in it's characters, plot and events. Meaning, the same characters, plots and events, just different names and places. Claris is Aliena, Ralph is William of Hamleigh, Godwyn is Philip, and Merthin is Jack. Instead of a cathedral, the focal point is a bridge.     This is not to say that the book isn't entertaining - it is. It's just that I was disappointed in the quality. I suppose that \\"Pillars\\" would be hard to follow for anyone.

0385737947|5.0|I am speechless.  Only once in a great while do you come across a book that is literally impossible to put down.  In fact, I don't believe this has happened to me since The DaVinci Code - when I honestly didn't want to take a break to eat, go to work, sleep...nothing.  But after all this time, Mr. Dashner has come along with a story that, literally, I will be talking about for years to come.<br /><br />As the Box opens, the darkness is finally lifted and a young man named Thomas (our main character) stares up into the eyes of a literal \\"clan\\" of young men.  As he's helped out of the strange contraption, and the Box falls back through a hole in the ground, the strange boys surrounding Thomas begin to speak.  The young boy is frightened.  He has no memory of who he is or where he came from, only that his name is Thomas and he has been transported to a place he's never seen.<br /><br />Immediately, a seventeen-year-old boy - the obvious leader of the group - named Alby, steps forward.  Thomas is amazed as the young man begins to speak.  The words are certainly English, but the comments such as calling him \\"greenbean,\\" and \\"klunk-for-brains,\\" is so confusing that Thomas has no idea what the older boy is talking about.  As things begin to unfold, Thomas receives a helper named Chuck.  Chuck is a sweetheart of a boy who was the \\"newbie\\" until Thomas arrived.  Through Chuck, Thomas is introduced to the Glade.<br /><br />The Gladers, which is what the group of boys call themselves, have a literal working colony that they've set up.  None of them can remember who they were or where they came from - they all just woke up in the dark and arrived in the Box.  Over time, they have built their community.  The head council who make all the rules - like their own little Senate - is run by the Keepers.  There are Keepers of all different things (Gardens/farming; The Blood House/animals for food; and - most importantly - The Runners.)<br /><br />The Runners are a group of young men who - when the giant metal doors open in the morning - run into a Maze that is right outside of the Glade.  This maze is filled with fearsome creatures that come out at night, called the Grievers.  The Grievers are deadly, and even if they only \\"swipe\\" someone with one of the long metal needles that protrude from their skin, the victim will go through The Change - which allows the victim to see \\"memories\\" of their previous life.  The Maze is also littered with strange metallic, red-eyed insects that seem to be spies - watching the Gladers and what they accomplish.<br /><br />Thomas is told that to go back home, the Maze needs to be solved.  That is the ONLY way out.  The next day after Thomas' arrival, the Box again begins to rise from the ground taking all the Gladers by surprise.  Usually there is a long time between boys being sent into their world.  But when the box opens, they are even more surprised.  A young girl lies comatose before them; a female who has somehow triggered the End.  Upon her arrival, Thomas begins to see flashes from a life he knows nothing about, and realizes that the Maze is something he's seen before.  The clock is ticking; they must solve the puzzle before the Grievers come and wipe them out.<br /><br />There are not enough adjectives in the human language to describe the story that Mr. Dashner has delivered.  This should be, literally, the next book phenomenon.  This will be classified, I suppose, as YA fiction.  I have to tell you that's just wrong; there's no way that young adults should get all the good luck.  This story is made for absolutely everyone who wants a pulse-pounding, imaginative thrill ride, with a story as intense and compelling as The Matrix.

This maze is filled with fearsome creatures that come out at night, called the Grievers.  The Grievers are deadly, and even if they only \\"swipe\\" someone with one of the long metal needles that protrude from their skin, the victim will go through The Change - which allows the victim to see \\"memories\\" of their previous life.  The Maze is also littered with strange metallic, red-eyed insects that seem to be spies - watching the Gladers and what they accomplish.    Thomas is told that to go back home, the Maze needs to be solved.  That is the ONLY way out.  The next day after Thomas' arrival, the Box again begins to rise from the ground taking all the Gladers by surprise.  Usually there is a long time between boys being sent into their world.  But when the box opens, they are even more surprised.  A young girl lies comatose before them; a female who has somehow triggered the End.  Upon her arrival, Thomas begins to see flashes from a life he knows nothing about, and realizes that the Maze is something he's seen before.  The clock is ticking; they must solve the puzzle before the Grievers come and wipe them out.    There are not enough adjectives in the human language to describe the story that Mr. Dashner has delivered.  This should be, literally, the next book phenomenon.  This will be classified, I suppose, as YA fiction.  I have to tell you that's just wrong; there's no way that young adults should get all the good luck.  This story is made for absolutely everyone who wants a pulse-pounding, imaginative thrill ride, with a story as intense and compelling as The Matrix.  I thank my lucky stars (and, the author, of course) that this is only Book I of a continuing series.  I will wait on the edge of my seat for the next one.      Amy Lignor, Bookpleasures.com Reviewer

1563890410|5.0|This work represents a return to coherent narrative, which I really appreciate. Volume Three was great, but it was a collection of stories, of dreams, rather than what I was expecting. Volume Four presents Gaiman back at the loom, weaving a host of Gods and Endless into several stunning chapters. I really enjoyed this thoughtful, engrossing work.
B002RV01QI|5.0|Enya is one of my all-time favorite performers. I have practically all of the compact discs regarding her music. This Irish songstress can move you to tears with her beautiful haunting melody and lyrics. I love \\"Book of Days\\" and \\"Only Time\\" as moving and haunting. I used to listen to her compact discs when I was driving or now on my home computer. Enya never disappoints her audience and she has remained faithful to the music itself. I didn't know about Nicky Ryan and Roma Ryan who are just as essential to Enya's success for providing the music and lyrics and Enya sings the songs. There is an extra bonus track on the compact disc entitled \\"Oiche Chiuin\\" with (Chorale). The songs are nice collection of Enya's range and style as well. No two songs are alike, they are each unique and each have a message of positivity.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|Surprisingly Good Movie,Tom Cruise is impeccable in the movie, Jamie Foxx even better. it's a good high paced thriller movie. the circumstances of the two characters and how everything intertwines is good.
0061537934|1.0|Occasionally I pick up a book with no expectation of quality one way or the other and without any specific interest other than to see what the hype is about. It's always a great feeling to be surprised when the writing or story itself are innovative or well-executed, or maybe even that I just learn or appreciate something that I wouldn't have before reading the book. After reading The Art of Racing in the Rain, I have a much better appreciation for style, imagination and the care that goes in to producing a great (or even just good) novel, because this book has absolutely none of these qualities. The book feels like nothing more than something thrown together to cash in on the success of Marley & Me. To say that the characterization is one-dimensional is too kind; most of the dialogue and character details seem like filler, and very often like shout-outs to acquaintances of the author. The physical setting and recitation of place names and addresses are gratuitous and would only be of interest to readers who already know the Seattle area where the story mostly takes place. Since I am not the intended audience for this book I can't say that it won't be of interest (fans of the work of Paulo Coelho, such as Eleven Minutes, should love it), but about the only thing to recommend it to anyone interested in literature or good writing is the impressively frequent use of Deus ex Machina, without which there is no plot.     The best feature of the book for this reader was the typography; at 26 lines per page, double-spaced I was able to finish the book in about a third of the time required for a paperback with a comparable page count.

But the Movie isn't Genius. being called some type of Noir. what it is, is UN-Original. Now the movie is not Horrible, But certainly anybody with a brain could have figured out the ending.
B000063V8T|5.0|Just an amazing season, it's everything I expected AND MORE!, this series really took shape on it's 3rd season, and never looked back, this continues the excellence in every way shape and form, season 3 onward, there is so much character development, and the stories are just amazing, I'm so glad this series survived it's first 2 seasons, it's amazing how it did, but thank God it did.    Lots of standout episodes on this season, I'll mention my favorite episodes, 'Redemption Part 2' is the conclusion to the 4th season cliffhanger, and delivers what you would expect, an excellent, and driven episode, 'Darmok' is another standout, it's so similar to The Original Series, 'Disaster' is great as well, most of the crew is locked out of the bridge, and Troi is forced to take command, 'Unification Parts 1 and 2' is an excellent episode about Spock, and a peace treaty with the Romulans, 'A Matter of Time' is a really great time episode, with an unsuspected villain! 'Conundrum' is another great episode, dealing with a parallel universe in a way, 'Power Play' is excellent as well, Troi, Data, and Chief O'Brian overthrow the bridge crew!, 'Ethics' is a good Klingon episode, 'Cause and Effect' is one of my favorite Star Trek episodes of ALL Star Trek, the Enterprise gets caught up in a temporal time loop, 'I, Borg' continues the excellence, it gets you closer to...YES, THE BORG!, a really well thought out episode, 'The Next Phase' Geordi and Ro are caught up in a parallel universe, where they exist, but cannot be seen, nor heard, 'The Inner Light' is another one of my favorite episodes of all Star Trek, it deals with Captain Picard, living the life of another man, on a planet doomed for destruction, and what a twist at the end!, 'Time's Arrow Part 1' Data finds about his own death in the 19th century, and an accident brings him back to that period.    I have yet to see the conclusion, but I will not have to wait, I have the whole series now, if you are a fan of Star Trek, this season is needed, if you are a fan of science fiction in general, you need this season, actually you need all season from 3 to 7, as they are the best.    Do yourself a favor, if you're a fan, get this series!
B002T9H2L0|5.0|This was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  There were so many layers to the movie and the actors all did an amazing job.  There were parts that were hard to watch and there were parts that made me scared and laugh.  It was an amazing film!  Once again, Quentin Tarantino does it again.  He's brilliant!
B00003CX95|2.0|I haven't seen Braveheart until a couple of weeks ago when I had to watch it in Alternate Forms of Literature class and I was excited about seeing it because everyone was talking about how good of a movie it was. In my opinion they couldn't of been any more wrong about the movie. Sure, the movie had decent acting and cinematography but all of the facts and the storyline of the movie SUCKED!     I really did not like how he William Wallace got married and then just ends up doing the princess soon after his wife dies, in real events William and the Princess were not even anywhere near the same age. It really took out of the movie for me also because William has all of these epic battle scenes but then he just ends up getting tortured and dies and that made me think a lot less of William as a hero. Overall the movie had some okay fight scenes and the dialogue wasn't bad but this movie to me definately did not live up to the hype.

B001TD1XWG|3.0|I've been listening to Lil Wayne since 1995, when he released the duo album \\"True Story\\" with B.G. locally in New Orleans.  I've had the opportunity of watching him evolve as an artist since he was only 13.<br /><br />If you're expecting a legit rock album, or something as hot as The Carter III, this album may not deliver for you.  My main complaint is that Weezy F. Baby uses the auto-tune sound for rock.  When other rappers make their foray into metal (Ice-T, Cypress Hill, Public Enemy), they maintain the hard sound from their rap albums.  So instead of Rage Against the Machine, Wayne goes the mainstream route on this album by mostly singing.  While he butchers vocals on \\"Paradice\\", he makes up for it by going hard \\"A Milli\\" style on \\"One Way Trip\\" (a Travis Barker beat which ironically is more rap than rock).<br /><br />Speaking of the production, I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't more original music by Weezy on this album.  The songs on the CD are produced largely by Hip Hop beatsmiths like Cool & Dre.  While I loved tracks like \\"On Fire\\" (sampling \\"She's on Fire from the movie Scarface), I really expected to hear original instrumentation from Wayne himself.<br /><br />As a fan of Lil Wayne for 15 years now, I have to admit that this album simply falls short.  Weezy singing over rock beats doesn't make it a rock album.  Less singing, more original music by Wayne, and he'll have a hot crossover album.
B001U7FWM8|3.0|Ok, admittedly not a music or art critic in any way, I would like to voice my opinion of this album. eh...  I bought Yellow House out of a suggestion from a friend. This turned out to be a very good idea and I have been hooked since.   I swooned and drooled over their performance of \\"Two Weeks\\" on Letterman a year or so back, which now seems like forever. I eventually forgot that an album was coming and survived off of a ripped live version of the track that then circulated many a playlist/ burned cd from then on.   Well here we are now with Veckatimest.I must say I am pretty unimpressed. The songs are atmospheric and many of them are very listenable deep tracks, with progressions, changes in pace, different movements. This stuff is deep and layered. The sounds drift and fade, then crash and climax, and venture off again in many directions.   The songs themselves are generally good and, given the right mood, enjoyable. My problem with this album is the album itself, as a whole. It just doesn't ever seem to fit together to me. In a sea of moodiness and recluse, the pop-oriented, upbeat \\"two weeks\\" seems out of place, forced sort of. The rest of the songs also never seem to give way to the next or nod at the last, which isn't necessarily a requirement but does make a difference in a coherent album.   The songs have a way of fading into the background leaving you to your thoughts while it ventures off into some deep cerebral meanderings, only to suddenly become engaging with rock and pop sensiblities and you're left confused. Is this supposed to be beautiful, ambient, background music suitable for conversations and company? At times it seems like it, then, without warning, it becomes a work that demands your full attention. In my opinion this was a very distracting feeling.   The songs individually work, and I will continue to listen to them, I'm sure, hence the three stars. I don't think, however that I can heft it upon my (huge)list of favorites because of the fact that the work doesn't seem to be a cohesive thing, instead many other things thrown together.   Again, this is my opinion and I sincerely hope it helps someone. Shipping was amazing, had the product within a few days in great condition.   -Stephen
1416955070|5.0|First, let me start off by saying that as with any piece of literature, it's a matter of taste.  And the tastes expressed here are... well, widely ranged.     Yet, I do NOT believe that this book deserves less than 2 stars, that would be just someone's biased pet peeves.    The book opens with a girl, Clary, whose discovers rather suddenly that she's different from an ordinary teenager girl.  And once she does, a cascade of events whirls her into the world that she, or anyone else like her for that matter, did not know existed.      As a character, I thought Clary made a fine heroine.  She was believable. Yes, sometimes she acted stupidly, she required protection, she craved comfort and attention, but those are the things that make a teenage girl real, don't they?  At the end, she showed that she was brave, loyal and moral.      The hero of the book was remarkable.  There are just so many things that make him stand out.  Jace is insanely witty and sarcastic, courageous to the point of being fearless, strong and abashing, unapologetic and unconforming.  His upbringing is his strength and his weakness.  He's such a complex character, and the first book only lets a glimpse into this soul.    The love story is..., well, unique.  Unlike most reviews, I didn't find it disgusting.  The story was meant to be a forbidden love, and it sure was.  The attraction between the two main characters began innocently and it evolved to a natural point.  Of course, how it will proceed is what raises our eyebrows.     The writing was good, not excellent though.  Some of the description was dragged on for a bit longer than necessary.  Not always describing the room, clothing, surroundings  in full detail is the best of ideas.  Sometimes, it has to be pertinent to the story, which is in this case there was half a chance that it was.  I do believe that this can be fixed in the future and overlooked in the meantime.     DO READ this book, and then judge yourself.
0307346617|2.0|First, a disclaimer: I gave up on the book after 44 pages. There are too many good books to read to waste one's time on writing that can't grab your attention in the first 50 pages. World War Z did improve, moderately, as I read on (I was ready to give up after about 15 pages), but the author's politics -- which stand in stark contrast to my own -- began to infect the writing to a degree that I knew I would not enjoy the rest of the book.<br /><br />Before going into that, let me first share my apolitical criticisms: To begin, the book is extremely boring. Friends who've read it say it picks up pace later, but I just don't think a zombie apocalypse book can afford to be boring for even one minute. Secondly, and this is something I'm sure was not going to change, while the author has substantial geopolitical and general knowledge (the one real strength of the work), he is not a good fiction writer. World War Z is supposed to be an \\"oral history\\" of the Zombie War, in the model of Studs Terkel's [[ASIN:1565843428 Working]] (and other works), which relied on first-person interviews. The problem is that Brooks uses exactly the same voice for every character! If the character is an Arab, there may be some obligatory \\"Death to the Jews!\\" stereotyping, but the vocabulary and general manner of speech of literally every character is exactly the same -- that of Brooks. This made for a very tedious read.<br /><br />Now on to the author's politics: I've seen others complain that Brook is overly \\"P.C.\\" That may be. But what turned my stomach early on was his ridiculously pro-Israeli bent. The one Arab character profiled is an antisemitic buffoon, and while people like this do no doubt exist, the state of Israel is glorified to an absurd degree. You see, ONLY Israel knew to protect itself from the zombie apocalypse... And here's the kicker: That great benevolent state opened its arms to all Arab refugees with a clean bill of health (i.e., who were not zombies) to protect them from what it knew was coming. Theoretically, they had to have been Palestinian, but in practice, they didn't check. The secular government of Israel did this against the fervent protest of Orthodox religious Jews, who then started a civil war within Israel... But because the Orthodox didn't serve in the military, they were easily crushed. Brooks is a rich, secular, American-born Jew. Do you think that may have something to do with his contempt for Orthodox Israeli Jews and his fantasy-world belief that Israel really just wants to get along with the Arab world?<br /><br />To be fair, my general impression is that a heck of a lot of thought and research went into World War Z. I just wish all that work could have materialized into something more entertaining and less infected with the author's politics (unless, of course, his politics were correct!)as coming.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|This DVD was so well done considering it is just rehearsal footage.  It allows one to see the many facets of the genius we all know and love.  Michael was absolutely AMAZING!!!  At the age of 50 this man STILL had it.  He had the same moves as the young men and women beside him AT FIFTY!!!!  I don't give a damn what the media say, MJ could not have done the amount of drugs they allege he did.  Michael was SHARP!!! He heard every note, he knew the steps, his body performed like those of men half his age. Hearing him speak with such kindness and patience, knowing for certain that he believed in the messages of his songs, and that he did simply LOVE everyone, made me wish I had known him. It makes me so sad that the world has lost him because he truly was a gift.  I will love and miss him forever.  It's so nice that I can still see and hear him as if he was actually still here.  RIP, Mike.  Finally he has peace.
0547258305|5.0|Absolutely loved the book. Unlike anything else out there.    The world created by Kashore is captivating.  The heroine is just what a heroine should be - clever, strong and brave, yet not easy and compromising.   She's got faults, but she doesn't deny them either.    The book is not sugar-coated - there is lots of violence, gruesome scenery and immorality.  That's what makes is realistic within its fantasy realm.     The love story is unique, to say the least, and most definitely untraditional.   It's not sappy or anguished, but it's loyal and true.    This is not a cliché \\"they-lived-happily-ever-after\\" type of books, the ending has an uncertainty which is great for a reader's imagination.

B002UZCJP2|5.0|Well, I just watched Gamer and Whiteout the day before and was dissappointed in both movies. I read the previous reviews and do not agree at all. Of course, I'm a science fiction fan, I love Star Trek (all series and movies, with the exception of Deep Space Nine) and if you add some suspense to science fiction, I'm there. I loved the whole concept and idea behind the movie. I also love the technology diplayed as well, (movies like the new Star Trek, Deja Vu, and Alien) Who did not love the room \\"Mother\\" was in on the Nostromo. I admit, I do love when thay combine technology and use it in a new concept. The movie is worth watching just for the idea behind it. If you loved \\"Data\\" on Star Trek - TNG, you'll love this movie. I don't really critizize how actors perform in a movie, my only question in the end is \\"Was I entertained?\\" I also rate a movie on it's after effect. If I remember a movie three days after I watched it, and liked it so much I want to order it, it's a five star for me. I had to go look up the names Whiteout and Gamer becuase I could not remember the names of the movies. Not that those movies were bad. They were just OK for me. The only thing I did not like (not Ving Rhames fault, by the way) was the character he played. You would think that in the age of surrogates and modern technology I would not be seeing the minorities dressed up like Jamicans living in the 1960's or 70's. I understand what the movie was trying to convey, they are against surrogates so they must also be against technogoly. Wrong Hollywood. We all live in the 20th century and I do believe it's possible to be against surrogates but understand some technogoly works in a positive way. After all, at the end of the movie, doesn't he use technology to elminate the surrogates? You see the irony, right?
0061134007|5.0|Jo Nesbo's THE REDBREAST, police detective Harry Hole has presented a perfect case against Sverre Olsen, a leader of the Neo-Nazi party in Norway. But a mistake made by the judge causes the case to fall apart and Olsen is back in the community. A month later Harry makes a mistake that nearly causes an international incident so, to prevent further embarrassment, Harry is promoted and assigned to surveillance duties, a job intended to keep him out of the spotlight. This,however, puts Harry in contact again with Olsen and his followers. The Neo-Nazi party has become increasingly active and there are rumors that something is planned for Norway's Independence Day which coincides with the Muslim holiday of Eid. Rumors spread suggesting that the crowds celebrating the national holiday will prevent the police from effectively responding to an attack on the Muslim community. Then a homeless man is murdered and suspicion falls on Svarre Olsen but as Harry investigates he realizes that the old Nazis and the young Nazis are tied together through a story of love, brutality, hero worship, and sexual extortion. Norway worked zealously to bury its connections to Germany during WWII. Vidkun Quisling made his name a synonym for traitor but he wasn't the only Norwegian to believe that the future would belong to the Third Reich. Many of Norway's young men died fighting for Germany on the eastern front and those who did not, returned to a country that was trying to re-write its recent past and so they were branded as traitors. Sixty years later, the old soldiers are being killed with surgical skill or a sniper's shot. Who is doing the killing and why, after so many years, has the assassin decided to act? Jo Nesbo evokes the war years by bringing the reader to the battlefields of Russia and a hospital in Vienna. He brings to life an Oslo comfortable in its democracy, aware of its 21st century problems, and happy to have been convinced that history is a story told by the winners and what is dark and shameful can be redacted with an historian's pen.is dark and shameful can be redacted with an historian's pen.
B0008ENICU|5.0|Great movie. I enjoy it every time. The beauty of this movie is that it is all women and you keep expecting to see a man but you don't they have made it so well that you think when a man is mentioned or there is a conversation with a man you will see or hear him but you never do. Great cast great acting Highly recommended.

I suggest this to all ages and it would make a great gift to anyone. Share the love of the world with your loved ones!!!
0132350882|4.0|Over numerous chapters, and three case studies, Robert Martin covers various patterns, techniques, and practices for writing clean code. He states that one must first write dirty code, and then clean it. That nicely sums up a large part of what programming is about. Robert shows refactorings in progress, and explains how each step makes dirty code a little cleaner. This works well to educate the reader. He also discusses details of error handling, unit testing, variable and function naming, encapsulation, and many other pieces of the programming puzzle.    The final chapter lists and details various code smells and how they can be remedied - essentially the entire book boiled down into one chapter. This chapter is worth the cost of the book.    Clean Code is a useful book; it is not a necessary read to get started programming in X, but it does contain best practices and patterns, making this book good supplemental material. Experienced coders will probably know most of the material already, but the book would be worth a read for the less experienced.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|This is an outstanding version of the stage play.  I enjoyed it very much.
B00000AFWZ|5.0|For me, since I once owned the original Nuggets LP, and am more familiar with a lot of these songs than the above reviewer, and own many of them though I don't own this collection, the reviewer has a good appreciation of some things, but when he puts down the Mojo Men's \\"Sit Down...\\" (a very good Buffalo Springfield song by the way)or the Blues Project's \\"No Time Like the Right Time,\\" Well, since these are among my all-time favorites, there is just no accounting for tastes. Get the album and judge everything for yourself. This collection represents one of my favorite musical worlds (I too grew up in Michigan in the days of Question Mark, The Woolies, the Rationals, and have not thought that most developments in rock since then have been much improvement, including the much-touted punk movement of the seventies. There is one new movement I can't get enough of, and that is the kind of \\"indie\\" music represented on the double-disc set Dark Was the Night. To me that picks up where the sixties left off, and where for the most part we somehow got lost. I'm also a dyed in the wool Dylan fan, and all of this music we're talking about got a push start from that man, I think.
B001QOGYFO|1.0|I had great expectations for a somewhat novel setting (the Arctic & Siberia have been done) but they began to unravel quickly when the prologue includes the back of Kate taking a shower. Litmus tests of quality failed repeatedly from that point onward.   Such as these openers:  (1.) Newly arriving workers/scientists are given the following prep talk: \\"Nature did not intend for you to survive out here.\\" & \\"Never underestimate the ice.\\" Well, duh! As if these people did not know where they were going; are not well educated and did not receive training prior to coming. Once there they hold dumb parties and drink massive amounts of alcohol. Must be the new criteria for choosing the right people for a challenging environment. Moon & Mars astronauts -  prepare yourself for partying.   (2.) To indicate an International flavor there was a field of large nation flags on thin plastic poles stuck into the ice for background. By the way, they are suppose to survive 100 mph winds?   (3.) From a plane a snow covered body lying in broken ice next to a cliff is spotted. Right! They wouldn't be able to see a snowboarding whale in that vast ice \\"wasteland\\" even if they were looking for one.   (4.) A lot of cheap-to-produce flashbacks that add little to the pacing and in fact tends to slow the movie down to the speed of a slug moving though molasses.   (5.) Shots of people in parkas and a little bit of Canadian landscape with the older style research buildings occupied most of the movie.
B0013ND30W|5.0|Haven't seen this since I was a kid. Now with the blu-ray I can take it in in a whole new light. There are nuances that I didn't recognize before. The resolution allows one to see the widescreen in the best detail you can for the animation. I highly recommend it.

0670021652|5.0|This was a really good read. There was a little bit of a lull in the middle when she was talking about the history of marriage. It did get a little boring. But once you went past that portion of the book, its a page turner. After the very last page, I closed the book, made a big sigh, and told a random person sitting beside me: this was a good book!
B001EAWMGA|5.0|The mystery of \\"Outlander\\" astonishes me. It has all the fixings of a Hollywood blockbuster - great story, timely themes, great actors, good special effects - and yet it got all the marketing treatment of a b-movie.<br /><br />Regardless, \\"Outlander\\" is a sci-fi fan's dream come true, a wonderful melding of futuristic science fiction and medieval warfare. The movie even extends beyond most sci-fi scripts and tries to establish a backstory of the \\"creature,\\" even gives the creature a name, a motivation and intertwines its history with that of the protagonist.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, \\"Outlander\\" isn't a perfect film. It suffers from being just a bit too long and stumbles over a few cliches and movie moments that will make you say \\"Saw that coming,\\" but it is so original and fun that it should have gotten more attention than it did.<br /><br />Four stars for the movie, and an extra star out of pity. Five stars total for \\"Outlander\\"!

B0030BYWKK|5.0|Following the brilliant \\"Trials of Van Occupanther\\" comes a more diliberate and beautifully understated \\"Courage of Others\\".  Some have called it 13th Century music for the 21st Century.  Perhaps that captures the spirit of the album. Like Van Occupanther, the texture and tone of \\"Courage\\" are layered and aurally stunning.  The songs are pastoral, timeless and deep. Having seen their live shows, which are great, the beauty of Midlake's carefully layered sounds are sometimes missed and not fully appreciated when listening to their CDs.  The vocals throughout Courage continue with very subtle chorused sounds of two, three and more vocals which play on top, around and underneath Tim Smith's voice. The results are gorgeous.  Similarly, the playing and musical instrumentation, have the same layered textures of guitar, keyboards and flute, which are tender and warm.    I think that some who are looking for another \\"Roscoe\\" or \\"Young Bride\\" might be dissappointed that there are no instant grabbers on \\"Courage\\", but let \\"Children of the Ground\\", \\"Acts of Man\\", \\"Winter Dies\\" or \\"Rulers Ruling All Things\\" play a couple of times and you will realize the breadth of this outstanding album. Simply stated, this is a beautiful, graceful work that, with repeated listenings will stand the test of time. Outstanding!

B000UBMWG4|4.0|You get 5 discs in this package. Three are Blu-ray, and two are DVDs. It's a great buy for the money, and of course, the Blu-ray discs show awesome picture and sound quality. One thing to note is that Disc 1 and Disc 5 may be identical due to a packaging mistake by Warner Bros. You can call them, and they will send you the disc you are missing. Just be sure to have them explain how to tell which disc is missing, so you get a replacement for the one you don't have (the ones you have are identical, so you need a way to tell which one is actually missing from your package).

0763631205|5.0|After reading many reviews on several different versions of A CHRISTMAS CAROL, I decided this one sounded like the version I was looking for.  I couldn't be more thrilled with the fact that it's unabridged and its illustrations are beautiful.  I watch this story every Christmas, in most versions, but never had the written story.  A professional stage production of A CHRISTMAS CAROL is offered every Season and I'd taken our sons when they were young and wanted to take our grandsons this year (2009).  Well, I bought each of them a copy of the book and put their ticket for the performance inside the front cover.  What a hit that was.  The boys now have the memory of seeing the live performance and owning their own copy of this remarkable classic.  Don't hesitate.  The price is unbelievably affordable and the quality of the book is impeccable. Enjoy!
B002R0F3Q2|3.0|the element of freedom..to release a subpar cd? its her right. and its ours to withhold our spending money. seriously alicia, come harder. your first three cds were killers. why stop now? where is your creativity? your inspiration?     songs in a minor grew in quality the more you listened. the diary of alicia keys had its moments. as i am was her most consistent.     this album has no standout track. the beyonce duet is suitably funky and does the trick, but you'd expect more of alicia. this type of track wouldn't stand out on an alicia album in the past; here it's the best of the best. most of the tracks here sound rather bland and melt together in an unpleasant manner...like a thanksgiving dinner at kfc.     try sleeping with a broken was the second single and shows alicia actually trying to grow as an artist...and experimenting with a new sound. its another high point on an otherwise downtrodden experience, but it still sadly reeks of a gimmick. alicia...you have what it takes. you have relied on pure talent to make it..stick with that. next time...really hone your craft and remind us once again why you are famous. loose the gimmicks.
B0019LY5IM|4.0|While my wife and I have enjoyed this series since it's inception (and have all other sets) this set has disc-quality problems.  The first 2 played well in our standard DVD player but the last 3 wouldn't \\"read\\" at all; the player (a late model Mitsubishi) doesn't even recognize them.  Luckily, I rec'd a blu-ray player for Xmas and have been able to view them but I would've bought the blu-ray version if I'd known they would be impossible to play on a standard player.  Having said that, the season in question dwells on time travel (and gets fairly annoying after awhile) but picks up considerably toward the last few episodes.  Of course, looking forward to #6.  Extras are fun; the cast and crew seemed to have fun doing this.
0810993139|5.0|Greg Heffley is a typical teenage boy in the sixth grade.  He is not a bad kid, not a good kid; he is simply a kid trying to get through his middle school years as more than just Greg Heffley.  Greg has two brothers; Rodrick, his older brother, who is in a metal band and Manny, his younger brother, who likes to get Greg in trouble.  The story is Greg's \\"journal.\\"  The book is called a diary, but Greg informs us on the very first page that it is a journal and not a diary.  Greg's journal takes us through his first year of middle school and the many things he does.  Greg's best friend, Rowley, is always being teased and bullied by Greg.  One of my favorite examples of Greg's bullying has to do with the big wheel Rowley gave Greg for Christmas.  Greg came up with a game and the game is as follows; one person rides the big wheel down a hill while the other throws a football and tries to know him off.  Of course Rowley is the lucky one to be the first and only rider.       The whole book is filled with many of these comical events Greg experiences in his daily life.  I think this is a great book for all ages and grade levels.  This book can be especially good for those reluctant readers who view reading as a hassle and not so fun.   It is not only an easy read, but full of humor as well.  I laughed throughout the entire book and had it read in about an hour and a half.  After reading it I had to suggest it to my husband, who doesn't really like to read in his free time.  He was skeptical at first but thanked me later for the enjoyment he experienced while reading it.  I could hear him laughing quite frequently as he read through the book.  We are both now interested in reading the rest of Kinney's Diary of a Wimpy Kid books.         Jeff Kinney had something going for him when he came up with the idea for these books.  They portray the life of a middle school aged boy almost perfectly.  Greg is just an average boy trying to fit in and making his life enjoyable by doing all these crazy but funny things.  Although it is about a middle school boy, girls will really enjoy this book too.  One thing that really brings this book to life is the string bean comic drawings Kinney illustrates on every page.  The pictures fit right along with the words and are part of what makes the book so humorous.  I would recommend this book to anyone, male or female, who is able to read.  It is laugh out loud funny no matter how old you are.
0807130087|1.0|I struggled through this as it was recommended by a friend (and had won a major award).  I didn't find it either hysterical or humorous - mostly inane.  The only humor being the reality tv sort.  If you enjoy watching (or reading about) train wrecks, this might be for you.  I know I'm in the minority, but I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.
0783226888|5.0|Even though Bruce plays such a violet criminal there is still something fascinating and almost endearing about him. Maybe it's because this is the very first Bruce Willis movie that I saw in which he played a horrible villain. In \\"The Jackal\\" Bruce plays the title character, a ruthless assassin who will not let anyone or anything get in his way. This movie is also notable for featuring Bruce Willis' only same-sex kiss. This was totally unexpected and kinda hot because this is not in line with his character's persona at all. The film starts out somewhat slow-moving but it sure picks up pace once the Jackal goes to work. Besides Bruce, I also especially enjoyed Diane Venora as a Russian major who is almost as smart as the Jackal. What's also memorable about this movie is all of the different looks that Bruce goes as the Jackal commits his crimes. My favorite look was the one he had for the shortest period, with the scruffy facial hair and mustache and short dark hair and cowboy boots. Like a fine violinist, Bruce plays this role with precision and art because he is constantly able to keep the viewers captivated.
B0036EH3TS|4.0|How are they able to release this movie on Blu-Ray? From everything I've read, I thought the negative was destroyed in a fire, and they would have had to spend millions on redoing a print.  Anyone have any inside scoop?
0374280967|5.0|\\"When they had read it, they rejoiced over its encouragement.\\" -- Acts 15:31<br /><br />When The Uncommon Reader came out, the reviews I read made the book and its premise seem dull and uninteresting. I avoided it.<br /><br />At my annual physical last month, my physician (who normally restricts his non-medical reading to things like the instructions on boxes of oatmeal) told me that this was the best book he had read in many years . . . and wouldn't let me out of the office without borrowing his copy. I was hooked. What could possibly be so interesting to him?<br /><br />I think that those who tell you about the contents of this novella do you a disservice. I haven't read a review that does more than parrot the plot . . . which is to miss the point of the book.<br /><br />Reading changes people for the better . . . even those who don't read. That's what this book is about. As you read The Uncommon Reader, I'm sure you'll be mentally reviewing the non-fiction story of your own life and how reading has changed you and those around you. Alan Bennett opens a closed door to many minds that have lost their sense of wonder about the power of the written word.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the quirkier conjectures in the novella, ones that caused me to remember with great laughter times when others have been baffled by book-based comments and questions I've shared with them. It was like suddenly seeing a movie of my own life, filled with its most humorous moments.<br /><br />The book ends before you've had your fill, leaving you wanting more. And you'll find more . . . by mentally continuing the story to where you would like to see it go. It's one of the most powerful endings for causing me to think that I remember since I first read Frank Stockton's short story, The Lady or the Tiger.<br /><br />Run, don't walk, to get this book, now!
0545123267|5.0|My Thoughts:<br /><br />Shiver has definitely made the list as one of my favorite books.<br /><br />Shiver is one of the few books that left me absolutely speechless (not to mention bawling my eyes out). I was completely attached to the characters practically right off the bat. Grace is a girl that seems, on the outside, to lead a totally normal life. However, her parents, though alive, are never around. This has forced Grace to grow up and take responsibility for herself. One of her only comforts is the pack of wolves that live in the forest behind her house. She is a likable character that I wouldn't mind having a cup of coffee with, in the least.<br /><br />Sam, oh Sam. Sa-woooon. Stupid in love? Check. Dark and mysterious? Check. Works at a bookstore? Check. Writes music? Check. Where do I sign up for one of those? Sam is a tortured soul that is forced to harbor a dark secret, even from Grace, in the beginning.<br /><br />The pair are totally in love and completely dynamic. The chemistry between Grace and Sam left me wholly unaware that there were other character's in the book until those characters threatened what Grace and Sam had.<br /><br />When I was forced to notice the other characters, it was easy to see that, while not as close to my heart as Grace and Sam, they too were dynamic. Grace's group of friends acted like a real group of teenagers, while Sam's pack behaved with the world-weariness and volatility you would expect.<br /><br />Maggie's writing style, whether in Shiver, Lament, or Ballad, always draws me in.<br />I love the dual points-of-view in Shiver, and not just how refreshing it is, but that there is an actual purpose to it. In my opinion, the emotions, memories, and ideas conveyed by both Grace and Sam would not have hit home as hard if Shiver had been written entirely in third person.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br /><br />Maggie Stiefvater draws you in the a no-nonsense quick start and sinks her claws in. There is no getting out of this story, even after the last page.
0465043550|5.0|If you've often wondered why most things economists or the popular press say about financial markets don't make sense, this book explains why, and in suprisingly well written terms. If only they taught math like this at school I might have taken some notice of it.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I loved this movie. It was refereshing and a great surprise to me!! I recommend it.
0143038419|3.0|After reading parts one and two I stopped. I was so disappointed; I'd hoped to read a book to which I could say Yes! Yes! Yes! all the way through.<br /><br />I couldn't say Yes to Italy. As many of the 1* reviews complain, all she does is whine. I do not like to read long essays on depression and loneliness. I groaned all the way along and skipped huge chunks here. A few sentences would have done the trick. Also, if there's one thing I can't stand is people complaining of the consequences of their own actions. SHE wanted to leave her husband! SHE made that move! The adult thing to do in that case is accept that life doesn't always adapt to your plans for it; that her husband's reaction is the consequence of HER decision. Stand up like a woman, for God's sake, and don't go on and on about how generous you were and how mean he is!<br /><br />I'd have preferred more about Italian culture than about its food. I'm really not into self indulgence, telling yourself how much you're worth it, how much you deserve to be spoilt, and gorging! She came over as a privileged [...] with an overblown sense of entitlement.<br /><br />The India part really bothered me. Not because I'm a devoted Christian or anything like that, but because I have been connected to a highly respected, authentic Indian ashram for almost 40 years and the picture she presents is so very misleading. I'm concerned that the millions reading this book will get the wrong impression.<br /><br />First of all: the way to find a true Guru is not to walk into somebody's house, see a picture of a beautiful woman, and declare \\"I want a spiritual guide too!\\" And then unquestioningly accept that beautiful woman as your Guru. Back in the days, finding a real Guru came only after a prolonged and difficult period of intense searching, and even today it should not come easily. Real Gurus are few and far between, today more than ever. Today there's a veritable supermarket of gurus (note the lower case!) and if you don't want to get into trouble then PLEASE BE CAREFUL, and DO YOUR RESEARCH. There are a lot of moneymakers out there.  A lot of scams. A lot of powerhungry people who speak authoritively and use their charisma for non-spiritual ends. Yoga and meditation is big business. Google is your friend. Accept nothing at face value; be as sceptical as the most hardened atheist.<br /><br />I researched Gilbert's guru and unfortunately her record is not clean. Her guru's guru was involved in sex scandals; there are financial and power issues going on in the organisation. Generally, any organisation that attracts thousands of Americans/Westerners and charges overpriced fees for meditation is suspect. A genuine Guru just does not do this. The Ashram I go to never charges a penny, not even for food. It is all free, has been for almost a century, and that is how it should be.  Beware of sex scandals and power struggles. A spiritual teacher can climb very high, but at those heights the ego gets particulalry slippery and that's when the power trips begin. I know many lovely, sincere seekers who belong to a similar cult with the same issues, and it breaks my heart for friends whose trust was abused and eventually destroyed with gurus unworthy of the name. I hope Gilbert manages to free herself one day. And I hope her readers are more discriminating than her.<br /><br />It took me several days before I could stomach the Indonesia section, and I'm glad to say that it redeemed the first two parts. Here, I really connected to Gilbert and cheered her on. I was happy (and a little envious!) when she found Felipe. What a delightful man! She did well by her friends in Bali, and was obviously loved by them (another thing I did not like in the India part was that almost no Indians featured in it!) Gilbert really blossomed in Bali, became a full woman, and it seems to me this was more \\"her\\" than the Ashram Liz. So the trip was worth it; she did grow out of her narcissism and is to be commended for that.<br /><br />The book is a light read; she does know how to engage the reader. This should however not be taken as a life-changing spiritual manual. It's new age fluff, but as such adequate.<br />So, my verdict of the book is: No. No. Yes! Good luck to her.w to engage the reader. This should however not be taken as a life-changing spiritual manual. It's new age fluff, but as such adequate.  So, my verdict of the book is: No. No. Yes!

B001UW58WW|5.0|I saw David Garrett on PBS the other night and I was completely taken by his style.  His music is incredibly fascinating. I got the CD a week ago and haven't stopped listening to it. I don't know yet which track is my favorite. I like them all.  I love the way he fuses classical tunes with rock sounds.  I've never thought that classical music would go so well with rock. Smooth Criminal is surprisingly good. \\"Who wants to live forever\\" is soft and sad at the same time. Also, \\"Rock Prelude\\" and \\"Thunderstruck\\" are examples of the wonderful creativity of David. Those are powerful pieces, filled with energy that is easily transmitted to the listener. I hightly recommend this CD to anyone that enjoys what I call \\"modern classical\\" .

The characters are vacuous, the prose is mediocre, and the plot is like a Dan Brown-novel; zipping from place to place at a hectic pace. Indeed, the last book I actively disliked was also a Dan Brown-novel.    Do not buy this book. Unless you like Dan Brown, in which case you probably don't understand any of the words I've just written.    It gets two stars, because it's not a Dan Brown-novel, and the lowest rating I can give isn't 0 stars.

B000A2RRF4|5.0|Since his death I've been strangely consumed with everything Michael Jackson.  A fan since the earliest days of the Jackson 5, he always amazed me with his jaw-dropping talent but revisiting all of his music and seeing previously unviewed videos just takes my breath away.  Wow!      You are in awe watching him perform.  From the opening stunner where he's catapulted onto the stage to the over-the-top departure in a space suit powered by a jetpack, I was mesmerized.  I was just swept up in his magic--loved the control and anticipation that he created by simply standing statue-still when he hit the stage. You almost wondered if he WAS just a statue and it was all just an illusion.  I have no idea how many people were at this concert, but it was a sea of rocking, swaying, \\"fainting\\", screaming humanity.  They'll never be another entertainer who was so adored, so affected by his fans.  I thought it was particularly touching to see him allow a fan to actually hug him and have him respond with such affection.  He didn't just hug--he LOVINGLY EMBRACED that very, very lucky fan and kissed her sweetly on the cheek.  She sure didn't want to let go.  Who would?    Yeah, he lip-synched on several songs but his duet with Sieda Garrett was so great and I had tears in my eyes during the very moving Will You Be There?  No one will ever move as sensually and with such perfect control and grace like he did.  He truly was otherworldly and simply \\"became\\" the dance when he was on stage, moving to a voice, a vibration heard and felt only by him.      Favorite song?  Couldn't possibly name one.  I love them all for the emotions they evoke, for the funk, and the beat and the love they never fail to convey.    This is as close as one can get to seeing a young, vibrant, extremely sexy and fabulously-talented Michael Jackson--at the top of his game!       I highly recommend this video. If you are a fan, or just curious about his music and genius creativity, you need to get this video.  YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!       The expression Gone Too Soon seems so inadequate in responding to his tragic and untimely death. As Berry Gordy said in Moonwalk, Michael Jackson comes along only once, period. One of the big regrets of my life is never getting to be part of one of his concerts.      How fortunate that we lived and enjoyed him during his time on earth.  May his music and compassionate humanitarianism live forever.  He was all for L.O.V.E.  May God bless and watch over his adorable children, always.    I love you Michael! (and I can clearly hear him respond with, \\"I love you more!\\").

0545123267|2.0|Potential spoilers present.<br />I was told this was going to be the next Twilight, but I have to say, I did not enjoy it.  Not that I enjoyed the Twilight books to begin with, but after reading some reviews on Shiver, I was hoping for something good.  I ended up scanning much of the book instead of really reading it.  Sam and Grace sounded almost exactly the same in the first person narrative which made reading a pain because I had to pay attention to every chapter heading to know who was talking.<br />That said, the prose wasn't bad.  It is a very readable book and if Twilight and anything like it is your thing, then great.  You'll love this especially since Sam is a wolf and if you're a Jacob fan, it's a bit of redemption for what happens in the last Twilight book.<br />The actual plot was mostly absent.  As I was scanning, I found that the majority of the \\"story\\" was basically Grace and Sam having a whirlwind romance and very little actually happens until the last fifth of the book.  By then I'd lost interest in the characters and was only reading to finish the book because I'd invested the time to get that far.  Grace seemed only to be there to pine after Sam and Sam only felt present when he was struggling with his wolfiness.<br />I give two stars for the fact Sam changes into wolf form when it's cold and the author had a few other little interesting tidbits here and there that were different from a lot of the current trends in vampire/werewolf fiction.<br />Heavy on the romance, but incredibly thin on plot and any real character development.
0345438205|1.0|Wow, as in after having been blown away by the surreal experience of \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" the movie and the book, and after being brought to tears by both, and even given moments of stunned shock and amazement at events in the two sequels, that it all comes down to this.<br /><br />In my own experience, \\"3001: The Final Odyssey\\" is the fastest science fiction book I've ever read.  It's also the most offensive, horrifying, and utterly pointless I've ever read.<br /><br />And I feel bad about saying that.  Arthur C. Clarke's forewords and post-word acknowledgements in all four books is incredible and does wonders in personalizing him and his books to us.  He even explicitly states that the books are not really canonized sequels, but \\"variations on a theme\\" in his words---sequels in separate universes.<br /><br />It allows for the 2061 epilogue of Lucifer suddenly disappearing in 3001 to be done away with in this book, which extends to approximately 3021 or so.<br /><br />But that's the very least of the book's problems.<br /><br />First, the good, or at least what can be passed off as good: It's well-written.  Mostly.  I say \\"mostly\\" because a lot of the pages are full of details, explanations, and descriptions that become so convoluted and complex as to become completely opaque.<br /><br />But even worse, there are instances where ENTIRE PAGES of text are completely copy-pasted from \\"2010\\" or \\"2061\\".  \\"2061\\" repeated the ENTIRE transmission of Dr. Tsien revealing there is life on Europa.  \\"3001\\" DOES THIS AGAIN!  \\"3001\\" ALSO completely copy-pastes Dave Bowman's revelation of life on Jupiter before the explosion.  It also copy-pastes an entire CHAPTER from the previous book, WITHOUT EVEN GIVING CONTEXT TO IT!  As in, when copying Bowman's description or Tsien's transmission, it was done in the context of people listening to the transmission, or Bowman revealing the information to Frank Poole.  One entire chapter is a total copy and paste from the previous book, even down to the NAME OF THE CHAPTER.<br /><br />This is no exaggeration: At least 10 pages of the book can be skipped over if you have read the previous books.  They are word-for-word copies from the previous books.<br /><br />Now, the bad:<br /><br />- Anyone with even the slightest affection for any religion, or even atheism, will find reason to be offended.  Clarke defends himself in the epilogue, not really claiming to be bashing any religion, and he can claim plausible deniability in claiming that the statements on religion only come from one particularly unlikeable and poorly characterized character, Dr. Khan, but it's still coming from the author, and not only are his views not in the least countered by Frank Poole (though he claims to think about doing so), but they're all but ACCEPTED by him by the end of the book<br /><br />He equates any and all religious belief as essentially mental illness.<br /><br />But don't worry!  Even atheists are considered in some way childish and immature for being so dogmatically certain of no God.  Instead, the spirituality in the future is divided into Theists and Deists.  I forget which one believes what, but honestly it doesn't make a damn bit of difference anyway, not out of any failure to identify the potential satire on the many subdivisions of Islam or Christianity, but just because no one in the book gives a damn, and it's one of the only true Red Herrings in the book.  It makes no damn difference in the book.<br /><br />Essentially, the beliefs are narrowed down to: Believing there cannot be more than one God, and Believing there cannot be less than one God.  Whooopee.<br /><br />So everyone out there who follows a religious belief, no matter how secular, how radical, how peaceful or tolerant: You're mentally deranged.  That is what this book states.<br /><br />The book, also under Dr Khan's moronic rantings, essentially states that RELIGION is the SOLE REASON that people have murdered one another in such large numbers, aside from personal conflict or emotion.<br /><br />The scary part is that some people seriously believe this.  I think South Park did a fun job of disproving this with their episode in which Cartman is frozen and goes 500 years into the future, where everyone is an atheist... and they are at total war with each other.<br /><br />My own statement is that RELIGION is NOT the REASON people have committed atrocities throughout the ages.  RELIGION has simply been the common banner.  It's common sense that if you want to gather a huge force of people, you must appeal to what they have in common.  Religion is what they have in common, because everyone has thoughts and fears and ideas and beliefs on life, death, and the surreal and supernatural.  Claiming religion is somehow a disease responsible for atrocities is like saying the bomb is responsible for such mass death of innocents.  Spoiler alert: Guns are cheaper.<br /><br />Anyway, the book basically points to mad religious freaks, essentially cultists, people like Aum Shinrikyo, who masterminded the Sarin gas attacks in the Tokyo subways in 1995, or Warren Jeffs, polygamist who has raped underaged girls and forced them to marry older men, who arise once out of a thousand over centuries, and an even fewer number end up acting out acts of religious terrorism.  Dr Khan has the sheer AUDACITY to hold these TINY TINY TINY MINORITY of religious extremist terrorists as evidence that RELIGION is bad and evil.<br /><br />Holy Fail, Batman.  That logic would give Mister Spock a heart attack or two.<br /><br />- Regardless of Clarke's own political beliefs, the future world in this novel is essentially one where every single technological nightmare and horror story of science fiction (short of evil alien/robot overlords) has come and gone, but unlike \\"Futurama\\" which plays this effectively for comedy, it's played so straight in this book, it is TERRIFYING.<br /><br />One example which seems horrifying and yet is so casually tossed aside, it's almost COMICAL is the concept of the Braincap, which produces essentially a virtual reality entirely within a person's mind.  Frank Poole wisely states this sort of thing could become insanely addictive, and Dr. Wallace casually says \\"Oh yeah, it is---millions of people have died from it\\" or whatever.  MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE DIED, SO UTTERLY ADDICTED TO THIS ULTIMATE ROLEPLAYING FANTASY DEVICE THAT THEIR BRAINS SIMPLY OVERLOADED AND DIED, and it's not only cast aside in one sentence, but is treated almost humorously, AND THE BRAINCAP IS STILL IN USE IN 3001!<br /><br />As someone who has a family member who has suffered from a crippling addiction, this is NOT a humorous idea for a book that is supposed to be hard, cerebral science fiction.<br /><br />Further making this horrifying, Braincap sessions are MANDATORY in this future, for some reason, and somehow it has become the style of the day for EVERYONE to shave their heads bald and wear wigs.<br /><br />- \\"3001\\" features essentially a \\"1984\\"-ish future without the historical revisionism.  A seemingly apathetic Big Brother.  There's even a point where one of the characters, having trouble focusing their thoughts in a telepathic message, QUOTES A 1984-ISH PARTY MANTRA TO CALM HERSELF.  \\"Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the party\\".  There is even a point in the book where the character claims Communism is the most perfect style of government, though quickly states that it's not the system they use.<br /><br />If that isn't disgusting or horrifying enough, there are people (whom Clarke tries to justify as claiming they are criminals undergoing rehabilitation) who are essentially mentally manipulated in order to serve as work slaves to pay off their debt.  THEY ARE LITERALLY CALLED \\"NONPERSONS\\".  I think only Frank Poole uses that term, but it's REPEATED EVERY SINGLE TIME.  And what sort of Unfortunate Implications arise that the much-esteemed Dr. Khan is a blonde-haired Nord, thelovely Dr. Wallace is mostly Japanese, and the NONPERSON CRIMINAL SLAVEMAN is brown?<br /><br />Further adding to the 1984 theme is identification implants in the palm of people's hands, complete with name, birthdate, and something like a social security number, and what amounts to eugenics, or at worst the concept of \\"Pre-Crime\\" like in Philip K. Dick's \\"Minority Report\\"---AND THIS IS TREATED LIKE A GOOD IDEA!  The Braincap is used essentially to detect people with mental diseases or illnesses or handicaps of any sort.  Those who are found to have signs of major psychosis are then separated from humanity if they cannot be cured.<br /><br />I have Asperger's Syndrome, also known as High Functioning Autism.  This is NOT a mental disease or illness or defect.  It is not curable.<br /><br />The mere IDEA that this (NOT the \\"regular\\" Autism) is something that SHOULD or CAN be cured is offensive to my entire existence.  HFA has shaped the person I am in a great many ways.  If it could be \\"cured\\" I would cease to exist---you cannot create a personality out of nothing.<br /><br />This all takes up a huge portion of my review because it takes up a huge portion of the book, close to 150 pages before the actual \\"story\\" starts.<br /><br />I put \\"story\\" in quotations because it's not so much a real story as it is a short plot-thread executed just to end this fantasy of terror.  Dave Bowman re-appears, contacting Frank Poole, explaining that the aliens behind the Monolith have apparently re-activated it.<br /><br />There then proceeds to be an explanation which not only COMPLETELY DESTROYS all the mystique, awe, mystery, and ultimately the beauty of the previous three books.  While logic and rational explanations always exist for romance, there's always a satisfaction in knowing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the creativity seemingly ran out before Clarke could finish this.  The Monolith's big mystery is... exactly what was revealed from the very first book: it's essentially a high-level computer holding all the programs and information the aliens left it with to oversee the development of species.<br /><br />Okay, so that wasn't very satisfying, but what makes it WORSE is that Clarke insinuates that this computer can essentially not only INTERACT but FALL VICTIM TO THE EXACT SAME ISSUES THAT BEFALL MODERN-DAY AND FUTURE HUMAN COMPUTERS.<br /><br />Clarke openly acknowledges in the postludium that the movie \\"Independence Day\\" used this exact same concept in its movie, but what differentiates this is that the aliens in the book have FROM THE VERY START OF THE SERIES been described to be BEYOND MACHINES.  THEY ARE PURE ENERGY.  THEY DO NOT NEED SPACESHIPS BECAUSE THEY -ARE- SPACESHIPS.  And their great technological marvel is taken down by a few trojan horses Norton AntiVirus 3022 would be able to detect but not fix?<br /><br />You've completely disconnected me, no pun.<br /><br />Worse, the essence of Dave Bowman and HAL, as displayed in the previous two books, are reduced from cosmic mystery between being ghosts and being sort of \\"hybrids\\" between human/computer and Alien, to MERE COMPUTER PROGRAMS.<br /><br />That's right.  The Being that Was But Still Contains the Essence of David Bowman... is a highly advanced computer program with highly advanced Artificial Intelligence.<br /><br />This cannot even be dismissed with that famous quote of Clarke's \\"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic\\" because the aliens ARE energy beings like Bowman had become, and it was even implied in earlier novels that he had BECOME one of them.<br /><br />So now he's just reduced to a computer program of the Monolith.<br /><br />But there's always hope with the PURPOSE, as Kane would say...<br /><br />But no.  The purpose is as human and easily deconstructed and destructed by even a mere human bastard philosopher like me.  These aliens are apparently testing various species.  An example is given of failure in the form of a planet manylightyears away which suffered a huge vacuum explosion so massive, it caused its star to go supernova.<br /><br />So apparently it's implied these aliens are going to do the same to us... based on what?  On a moral system completely beyond our own understanding?  And yet it's treated as though it is going by Clarke's own moral system, in which Humanity in the 20th century is apparently guilty of extinction.<br /><br />Mister Spock would die of multiple heart attacks from the insanely faulty logic of that.<br /><br />And to make sure Spock dies as painfully as possible, this is based on OUTDATED INFORMATION!  Apparently since these aliens are located 450 lightyears away, the original Monolith transmission from \\"2001\\" reached the aliens nearly 500 years later, and so based on information THEY SHOULD KNOW TO BE FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OUTDATED, they send instructions of destruction (no pun) to the Monolith, which will take ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED YEARS.<br /><br />Imagine if the people of the world were to be judged by a modern-day legal system based on what our species did in the 1000s AD, from a frame of mind of modern-day law and morality.<br /><br />Wow.  This book is a marvel in how it manages to thoroughly offend the sensibility of any and every living thing with a sound and thinking mind.<br /><br />But I can still love Arthur C. Clarke as an author, because as he says in his postludium, copying from the phrase a US president once used:<br /><br />\\"It's fiction, stupid\\"of people's hands, complete with name, birthdate, and something like a social security number, and what amounts to eugenics, or at worst the concept of \\"Pre-Crime\\" like in Philip K.

B000XSWVEC|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I first started watching this movie.  But boy oh boy when it was over I could only hope to have one of my children join a drumlin (when they are older)just so I could watch it live.  This movie has a good story line too, but the dumming...fabulous!

1594488843|5.0|Drive by Daniel Pink<br /><br />One main drive has propelled us for centuries. Biological Drive. This covered eating, drinking and reproducing.<br /><br />Reward/punishment response is the second most used drive, we'll call it Carrot/Stick Drive.<br /><br />Now there appears to be another drive, a third drive we'll call \\"Intrinsic Motivation\\" and it is the basis for the new business OS.<br /><br />Motivation 2.0 has served us for many decades and carried us out of the depression by making the bulk of the workforce into cogs/drones/etc who mindlessly followed a set of protocols. To a degree that same mentality followed many into the cubical farms of white-collar work.<br /><br />But many of us have noticed over time (and probably therapy) that our creative side was crushed, pushed so far deep inside us that many of us forgot what it was like to color outside the lines.<br /><br />We have been so programmed by Motivation 2.0 to reward good behavior and to punish bad behavior that when someone tells us another OS is available we probably want to laugh.<br /><br />It's hard to believe, but some people will do something just for the sake of doing it and the reward associated with doing it well.<br /><br />Pink starts out explaining how several components of our every day lives are the result of projects that are worked on for free by people who only wish to be rewarded by the ability to work with others who share their passion.<br /><br />If you paid these folks to do what they do it would stifle their creativity and bring the project to a screeching halt. Wikipedia is free and was built for free. It is also a creative work of an aspect of Motivation 3.0<br /><br />A few jobs can be enticed with reward, but those jobs are fewer and fewer in our country each year. Mostly algorithmic (repetitive processes) work can be (and has been) outsourced or offshored and in some cases done better and with more attention to detail. Of note: only 30% of job growth comes from this type of work.<br /><br />However, heuristic, creative work such as design or finding out something that we didn't know we couldn't live without cannot be enticed or punished in its execution. This less step-by-step work now accounts for 70% of US job growth.<br /><br />Enticing people to do a task has the effect (according to forty years of research) of making folks actually not want to complete the task or do it again. Punishment also has a similar effect. Parents punished for picking their children up late from pre-school with a fine, were more apt to actually be tardy since the only relation to the act was to be fined. The relationship with the teacher had been monetized in relation to being late and was no longer a factor.<br /><br />As we have seen in our culture, reward can lead to shortcuts and poor judgement. Sears technicians who overcharged customers is one example. As Pink states \\"The problem with making an extrinsic reward the only destination that matters is that some people will choose the quickest route there, even if it means taking the low road.\\"<br /><br />One way around this backfiring is to give the reward after the fact, but do not make it a condition of future behavior. Making the reward more sporadic is better in the long run.<br /><br />Pink points out many interesting studies done in various environments that in themselves make for interesting reading. One example was that of artists who executed both commissioned and non-commissioned works. The commissioned works, when judged by a panel who knew nothing of the source of the works found the non-commissioned works to be more artistic and expressive while the commissioned works were too \\"constraining\\"  according to the panel of experts.<br /><br />\\"If-Then\\" rewards are being replaced by \\"now that\\" rewards that work in conduction with nontangible rewards. The reward of working on a team that produces an amazing work for an event is as rewarding to some if not more than the money. Useful information,instead of efforts to manipulate behavior also work well with creative teams.<br /><br />Studies have shown that we exhibit two main types of behavior. Type I and Type X. Type I is Intrinsic. These types are motivated by the act of doing the work itself. Creating environments where our innate psychological needs flourish will see more of this behavior.<br /><br />By default we have an innate inner drive to be autonomous, self-determined and connected to one another. When we are allowed to be in our \\"natural\\" state, we satisfied, motivated and productive.<br /><br />Any other behavior is learned. At the center of Type X behavior is motivation so wrapped up in Carrot/Stick that to take that away is to remove the air that person breathes. Type X does succeed, in the short run. But in the long run, Type I will outperform and master the tasks needed. And Type X's end up in the cardiac ward.<br /><br />Motivation 3.0 has three major upgrades built in that help bypass \\"short-term-itis\\" and move you in to more long-term thinking/working:<br /><br />Autonomy, or giving someone the freedom to act is a good thing. Without it we would not have \\"Post-it\\" notes. They are the product of what William Mcknight of 3M called \\"experimental doodling.\\" We would also be without Gmail from Google, another product of what is turning out to be the most productive time spent at Google, or \\"20% Time\\" as they call it.<br /><br />Mastery, the glassy-eyed look one has when they are so connected with their work they become one with the task. Some call it \\"flow\\" and athletes have used it to describe the feeling akin to runners-high at times. Mastery is attained in many ways, each discipline has its own path, but most of us know that simply attempting to master a skill is a rush in itself. [[ASIN:0316017922 Outliers: The Story of Success]]<br /><br />Purpose is what makes some people get up at the crack of dawn and stay up late into the evening. It is like a burning desire.

0736063684|5.0|I bought this at Costco on a whim, because I weight train and it is really fantastic.     Explanations of what an excercise will do and what muscle groups are an excellent source of information, but I am a visiual learner and this product really shows you what each excercise does in the gym, so you can focus on a particular area more easily. It is not and encyclopedia but a great resource of information.    It has the info with the pictures to help and considering it is translated it is still fairly easy to understand.     For weight trainers this is a great resource!
B003539QKO|5.0|Onece again Wayne shows hit wit, Skill and Versatility on this CD. It's amazing that he does very little writing and most of his lyrics are off the top of his head.as a lyrisist I cannot freestyle i can only write and its one hard thing to do,if you're a rapper you know this. If you are't a fan of auto-tune or hard guitar riffs this isnt for you but I happen to like the switch. Wayne makes it seem easy and effortless. I dont know if this is equal to The Carter III but its close and definately a must have for all fans. Young money is the future of hip hop so dont sleep on them because theres alot more to come.Check out tracks 7,8,.10 and 14 those happen to be my favs. Hope you lie it as much as i did
B00023BLXK|5.0|This is my new favorite movie.  If you liked the first Dirty Dancing you'll love this one.  It's new and fresh, and very entertaining.  Patrick Swayze even made a few cameo apperances in this movie.  I highly recommend buying this movie.  You'll love adding it to your collection.
B0026P3G12|5.0|The Susan Boyle CD is great to listen to and she is a great person also.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have used this DVD for the past 7 weeks.  I love it.  I began switching between levels immediately, although only between 1 and 2...I added Level 3 after a month of levels 1 and 2.  I find this to be a great quick workout.  If I only have 20 minutes, I do one workout.  If I want more, I do two workouts and I have even attempted to do all 3.  I've only done this twice.  I began with 3lb weights and now use 5 lbs ones.  This video can be adapted and made more difficult by using heavier weights.  I have already dropped 2 pants sizes, lost several inches around my waist, thighs and arms.  I've lost almost 15lbs, but I haven't missed a day of exercise....except one and that was a big mistake.  Don't think that you need to rest your body....you don't.  Just modify the moves to accommodate your muscles if they are sore.  I missed one day and the next day I thought I was going to die.  Toughen up and don't stop.  Don't give up.  This DVD is worth the $9.00 and you will notice a difference in your weight and body toning.  I will be working out with Jillian for as long as I can.  It is definitely worth it!!
B0001I55OC|4.0|I bought Timeline for Gerard Butler, but got pulled into the story as well. the actors delivered truly believable performances and you were kept wondering what was going to happen next.<br />  The battle scenes were beautifully shot, you actually felt you were in the battle and could smell the smoke and the blood of battle. The photography and choice of locations left me spellbound. I had to watch this movie twice the first night.
0142410314|5.0|I love this book! I recommend it to all ages. It is about a boy name Charlie who is poor and hungry during winter. During winter an exciting news happens. Mr. Willy Wonka's Marvelous Chocolate Factory is putting five golden tickets in candy bars. See the five lucky kids that come to see the secrets of Mr. Willy Wonka's Factory. My favorite part is the factory.
B001F12J0C|5.0|I really  thought I had reviewed this item  before!!! But guess i hadn't. I haven't watched the DVD's yet. But the delivery time was absolutely  amazing!!!. Thought I had just ordered them and then there they were at my  door.!!! Will order from again. They looked like they were all in  tip top condition as advertised.
0142410373|5.0|I love the book, The Witches! Roald Dahl did it again. His wonderful imagination of witches ! In the book he tells you how witches really look like. A boy goes on his imagination with witches! His parents died from a car crash, or so they say. So the boy lives with his grandma. Will the witches die and never return to kill children? That's the whole point to kill all children. Will the boy succeed in saving the children from the witches? Will the witches take over the world? Find out in the book The Witches?
B000068TPN|5.0|This is an amazing piece of military history.  Read it over and over.  By the way, the movie didn't even tell half the story.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Took me a little while to get into it, but as it progresses, I got more involved with the characters- and ended up loving it.  Great movie !
159448385X|5.0|This book is amazing! It is touching in its portrayal of human strength through suffering, loss and disappointment. I've learned a lot about a country (Afghanistan) that I really knew nothing about before, and I've come to somewhat understand and greatly appreciate the Afghan culture. It opens your eyes to the suffering that the people of war-ravaged Afghanistan have endured and continue to do endure on a daily basis. I would recommend this book to anyone looking to expand their cultural horizons, while at the same time experiencing a great story about the strength of 2 women in Kabul who experience love and loss during modern day war.
B001M5UDGS|2.0|...but I don't recommend it either.  The first episode, for me, I could have almost completely done without.  Only at the very end of that episode did anything seem to click.  The 2nd and 3rd were better but I didn't like the way it ended.  All-in-all...just not all that funny, though it has its moments.
B002BJGYV2|5.0|I've gotten hooked on the Gilmore Girls and want to also get the 6th & 7th Seasons soon. The repackaging was nice also.
B0028T6XXY|2.0|I doubt if anyone has an accurate total of the number of 78's, 45's, LP's, or CD's Sinatra released. It has to be in the hundreds, maybe thousands. With a small amount of research, Michael, you could surely find some new songs to record. Even the new ones (which most of us Sinatra fans have never heard of) that you record are second rate. Sinatra's repetoire included Gershwin, Porter, Berlin, Martin and Blane, Warren, Cahn and Van Heusen, Weill, Arlen...on and on...but how many more times are YOUR fans going to keep buying \\"Call Me Irresponsible\\", \\"Feeling Good\\", \\"Fever\\", \\"Come Fly With Me\\"? I swear, every CD you record or I attempt to buy is always full of repeats or previously recorded songs...not that they weren't good the first time you recorded them...but hiring a new A&R man would increase your sales and your popularity. I like your voice but I, as most of your fans, long for something different. You're in a rut...rehashing the same tunes on each new CD. Why should I continue buying them when I apparently have everything you know? If you're gonna revive the sounds of Sinatra and Bennett...pick out twelve NEW Sinatra songs. I didn't buy your Madison Square Garden CD as I think I already own five or six recordings of your \\"Call Me Irresposible\\"...each new recording sounds like the one before. Surely, I can't believe that your grandpa would continue to pick the same songs. If you want any more of my money...let's hear an entire CD of Sinatra songs and forget about the tuneless originals. Sorry kid, but they're just not that good. Even Sinatra couldn't make them sound great. Oh, well, you won a Grammy with the same old schlock...I guess, they're be MORE repeats on next year's CD. You're wasting your talent and our time and money!
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This book is very well written and gives a great deal of insight into Alzheimers Disease. I couldn't put the book down. Alice, the main character, tells her story first person and her descent into the depths of the desease is wonderfully described.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I chose both J & A in my summary because one without the other would not have succeeded in the deep and profound lives they lived. First of all a sober assessment of this film should be put aside until one has read David McCullough's fantastic historical account of J.A. The reader is entertained by a master storyteller, who first caught my ear in the ever great Ken Burns series \\"The Civil War\\", where he was used as narrator and historian. Once you have read this book then the many facts that you face when watching the film will make all the more sense.    Why is J.A. such a great series? The producers and director took great pains to reproduce the look and feel, the authenticity of the times. (my one and only criticism of this and just about every such series is that costumes, especially of the soldiers all look like they were just freshly pressed and taken from the closet. Soldiers of the day had no such luxury and probably looked pretty shabby, notwithstanding the bright colours. But I quibble....) The overall view is the impression that we are looking at the times as they really were. What I noted in particular was the extreme hazards of a winter time boat crossing of the Atlantic !!!! Good heavens, I can think of few things at that time or our own that were more perilous and as we watch poor J.A. wretchedly sick as the boat crashes upon the waves....we tremble at their fate. Never mind that they had to fight a pitched battle against a British ship....and could have been sunk themselves.    John Adams was a complex man but a very good and moral one. Bull headed when he dug in his heels, opinionated, erudite, hard working, a devoted and loving father and husband. All of his life's energies he channelled through the filter that was his beloved wife, Abigail. John trusted no other human as much as his Abigail. They say that they had one of the great love and literary affairs of the century. If the volume of correspondence and the expressions therein are adequate testimony, then we witness a true love. John was both a farmer, scholar and lawyer, something not seen much in our time. He was also guided by a simple but iron willed principle that all men must be governed by laws and that society that abandons them opens itself up to the rule of the mob. Early in his life he is tested as he is given the thankless task of defending British soldiers who stood accused of killing several colonists. His uneasy but fierce and successful defence of the soldiers gives us an idea of the depth of this man. He was to be tested over and over again as he was torn away from wife and children to tend to national duties as they rapidly evolved. There was not a single time that he did not gain his wife's blessings to his paths, no matter the pain it caused her.    The series quite accurately tells their story. From the incredibly difficult days where he was away in Philadelphia helping hammer out the declaration of independence while sickness and the British forces gave his wife and children many sleepless nights to the even more wrenching times when John was alone in Europe trying with great vexation to motivate French and Dutch bankers and royalty to support the erupting American revolution. The series shows the physical depredations he lived through and the mentally trying decision to send his young son John Quincy off to St. Petersburg as a diplomatic assistant.    The ensemble cast is superb from top to bottom. Much detail is given to making the actors appear as close to the historical characters. While they had no photography back then they certainly had plenty of portrait painters and we know pretty much what they looked like. David Morse's depiction of Washington was almost inch for inch what he would have looked like, the actor being as tall as Washington was. As well it is known that Washington's teeth had been removed or came out and that he wore ivory dentures. Look at all the stuffing in Morse's mouth and the attempt to reproduce the generals face is all there.    While there is so much tragedy in the Adams family, with the loss of a daughter to cancer and a son to alcoholism, the most shattering moment comes when John watches his wife slip away. Such very great people you cannot find much in the historical record. I still must say that I find Thomas Jefferson one of the most vile of the founding fathers. A prosperous, brilliant, urbane, conniving, calculating and charming man who simply could not see his pleasures and wealth compromised by ever giving up his slaves, of which it now appears that he fathered a number of children; I find him personally disgusting. Give me John Adams and the manner in which he was a father, a husband, a Vice and President of the United States. When all is said and done, this is one of those very great series that should be mandatory in every American school system.    The chemistry between Laura Linney and Paul Giamatti is composed of a wealth of excellent dialogue, quotes from their huge output of letters to each other and by the unbreakable bonds of love. Clearly these actors felt a sympathy for these founders and were able to channel their spirit with such clarity. Tom Wilkinson's depiction of Dr. Benjamin Franklin is wonderful to behold. Watch for the hilarious chess game played in the bathtub. As I am watching the series all over again it motivates me to re-read McCullough's book. Both are treasures you should own and learn from.
B002RSDW80|4.0|This was a great movie.  I had seen it at the show in one of the girls night out evenings.  I liked it so much. I purchased the movie as one to add to my collection.  It will go on the shelf at the cottage/summer home and join its place with all the other feel good clasics.  It even got the thumbs up vote from my husband as we watched it at home.

It was bad enough to turn it into a musical--the \\"real\\" Mary Poppins never sang--but adding cartoons??  Anyone of any age who has read the books **before** seeing the movie has found this very sappy, saccharine movie very hard to digest.  I know I did when I was about 8 or 9 years old.

B001EO2UKO|4.0|With each of Dido's albums, she appeared to be becoming more and more obscure due to the public's evident waning interest in her work. Had it not been for a 2008 appearance on the Tonight Show, I wouldn't have even known she released an album that year. But I finally got around to listening to Safe Trip Home.<br /><br />Dido's soft-but-sweet vocals haven't changed much, which makes it easy to pick out highlights like \\"Never Want to Say It's Love\\", \\"Burnin Love\\" and \\"Quiet Times\\". \\"Us 2 Little Gods\\" is also good even though she is yet another victim of the confusion of \\"us\\" and \\"we\\" (yeah, I know no one came here for an English lesson, but I couldn't help it). Anyway, \\"Don't Believe in Love\\" is another one of those cases where the lyrics don't look like much on paper, but it's all in the way she sings them.<br /><br />I also wonder which version of the album I have because most outlets list the album as having eleven tracks but mine has fourteen. The three extra songs are \\"For One Day\\" (which is pretty okay), \\"Summer\\" (a highlight) and a remix of an earlier song on the album called \\"Northern Skies\\". And the latter is one of those remixes that doesn't sound much different from the original version -- in fact, it doesn't sound different at all (and the original is five minutes too long to begin with). Though Dido isn't getting as much attention as she used to (outside of this site, anyway), there's nothing but a comfortable ride to be had on this safe trip home.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B0001US8FI|5.0|This is a great product. I ordered it for a gift and was happy to have it arrive on time.

B002M9WW30|4.0|Alright well all 6 Rocky films in blu ray for 49.99$ (at this date 2/1/2010) is a great deal. The movies themselves look terrific (but could look a bit better not to mention use some Stallone commentary on each film outside of 1&6 which is why this gets 4 stars and not 5) and probably won't look better. Sound is solid and the special features are alright (nice retrospective on the villains tho but where is Mr.T?) so outside of what I listed its a pretty good set.    As for the films lets break it down.    Rocky - The first and a film that continues to be the legend. The little engine that could movie. Amazing film a total classic.    Rocky 2 - Worthy sequel to a classic film. Its still small and intimate as you go through Rocky's struggle. Props for showing Rocky learning to read.    Rocky 3 - So you enjoyed being at the top of the world what happens when you aren't and lose your manager/trainer? Awesome villain, awesome training sequences and still Carl Weathers is the truth as Apollo \\" Man when we fought you had that eye of the tiger that edge and we got to get it back! \\". Whats stunning is to watch Rocky change his fighting style from hard hitting Southpaw tomato can to right handed speedster.    Rocky 4 - Watched this nostaligic, cinematic gem recently and it still holds up as a goofy, heartfelt cartoon. The film is so damn entertaining and when the \\" Theres no easy way out \\" montage ends if it doesn't get you a little misty nothing will. Nothing beats the training montages in the Rocky films (man I can't believe those situps Rocky was doing off the second tier in the barn) but here the cinematography in Russia is breathtakingly beautiful.    Plus it's just plain fun to watch... no plot to follow, just kick ass montages and geektastic lines.    It was like in 1-3 they were trying to make great movies, make them respectable and realistic... then when they got to 4 it was like \\"aw screw it, let's just make a God damn music video, that's all these films have becomeany way.\\" They didn't try to make the movie anything but what it really was, and that's why 4 is so great.    Rocky 5 - The worst Rocky film hands down and a total turd. Its dumb its boring and its ultimately pointless. Stallone originally wrote that Rocky died at the end of brain damage. The studio says no which leads to Rocky Balboa.    Rocky Balboa aka Rocky 6 - A return to form but still not a pox on the first 4 films. Antonio Tarver is not scary, interesting or a good actor on camera thats pretty much a three strikes and you're out. Luckily Stallone knows how to make a film and stage a fight. Its worthy and good but its not very entertaining, fun or rewatchable. Watch Rocky 1, 2, 3 or 4 to experience the real Rocky.    So great blu ray set that almost is 5 stars. Why no commentaries for 2, 3, 4 or 5 Sylvester?
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|A great movie the family can enjoy.  Very funny.  One of the best Pixar films.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Great movie and part of a solid trilogy.  Lots of action supplemented with Arnold's one liners make for a good watch.  As far as the Blu-Ray goes, it looks better than a DVD, but not by much.  Pretty good for a 20yr old movie I guess.
B001TD1XWG|4.0|Alright, We got a Pitch for you...Take the biggest rapper in the world, pair him off with an auto-tune and cookie-cutter hard rock tracks and see what happens. The result isn't as bad as you'd think at first.    In fact, Lil Wayne pulls more of a Prince in the aspect of evolving as an artist, rather than staying formulaic. It takes balls to try something unique - especially when you're at the top of your game...and this proves Lil Wayne a true artist.    The only negative to this album is the rock samples. The back-beats are sub-par at best and sound dated. (What do you expect with Blink 182 and Korn alumni contributing the \\"rock.\\" There's a reason these guys are doomed to re-hash 1996 for the rest of their careers.) Lil Wayne could have taken a slice from cutting edge rock artists and even blended electro with them (see Timbaland, Pendelum or KMFDM.) Talk about a mind-trip that album would have been.    All in all, its a good listen. There's good pop structure and great lyrics. The delivery sounds quality and the production sounds top notch. Only in 2010 could we see an album like this surface. And what a start to the new year.    For another great example of an artist stepping out of his comfort zone, check out Chris Cornell and Timbaland on the album Scream - [[ASIN:B001FBSMF8 Scream]]    Check out Prince when he started experimenting with the \\"nu-funk\\" sounds of the 90's on his symbol-album right here - [[ASIN:B000006L4R Prince & The New Power Generation]]    And for the future of electro/rock beats - check out this unsigned band called \\"The S1nd1cate\\" - their debut album (RELOADED) can be found on Amazon.com
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I've been a fan of this series since first viewing it on the CBC in 1974.  I've owned the VHS set, but have since given that to a friend.  When I read online about this 30th Anniversary edition DVD set I searched around and found the best price through Amazon and one of their sub-sellers.  If you're a WWII history buff like me you'll appreciate the 12 additional hours of extras; most of them extended versions of interviews that appear in the series in more-edited form.    Olivier's narration is absolutely one of the best things about this production.  However, the producers note that had they been making it more recently they would have included subtitles for the interviews rather than voice-over translation.
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|Of the couple hundred DVD's that I have owned, this one is simply the best.  The cinematography, the sound, the clarity is all great.  It helps that the Killers are one of my favorite bands.  I have watched this DVD many times and I am still amazed each time by how good this DVD is.
B001BTG3OQ|4.0|I hesitated to buy this flash.  The SB-600 was dated and no replacement was rumored, and I really wanted to buy one flash one time and not have to think about it.  I purchased it thinking I was a non-professional and I would not run into the thermal shutdown issue.  I purchased ENELOOP NiMH batteries and I started shooting.  I've only experienced thermal shutdown twice - and that was with bounce flash + a very dark room + iso 200 photography with a 70 or 80 photos in a row.  If you set your camera to iso100 in a dark room and really push the flash, you can hit this really quickly but is that realistic?  I am disappointed that there is such a cloud of controversy surrounding it.  It may hurt resale.  My experience was that when the temperature gauge hits it's midpoint, you will quickly get to thermal shutdown in the next couple of photos.  The batteries were not even warm when taken out, nor was any part of the flash that I could touch.  Once shutdown occurs, you can not turn on the flash and get into the menus to turn off the thermal protection circuit until the unit cools down. Plan accordingly.  Either turn off thermal shutdown protection before and monitor the temperature frequently or plan to wait about 5 or 10 minutes for the unit to cool down.  If you are a pro, you probably have more than one flash anyway and can swap them though this is inconvenient.    All in all, it is a powerful excellent flash.  It helps me make fantastic memorable photos.  If you can't afford a $2000+ full frame camera to shoot low light and high ISO, then having the best flash is the next best alternative.  Plus as you grow your photography skills and upgrade equipment, this flash will continue to serve you well.    The flash has the nikon CLS (creative lighting system) so you can put the flash off-camera and shoot from different angles, or use an umbrella to get nice diffuse light.  It also comes with a ton of extras -- nice storage case, some gels for coloring the light coming out ofthe flash, a diffusion dome, a white bounce card.    I definitely recommend this flash though I hope some day soon, Nikon issues a firmware fix or services these very expensive flashes and rids us of the temperature issues.
0385737424|3.0|I fully expected to love this children's book; I had heard great things about it from several trustworthy people, and it had just won the Newbery Medal, and it had been heavily influenced by [[ASIN:0312367546 A Wrinkle in Time]] and included elements of time travel. What could go wrong?<br /><br />Unfortunately, I think I may have suffered from too-high expectations going into this book, because it ultimately left me feeling flat. First, the interactions between the characters didn't seem real to me; relationships tended to be based on sudden, grand revelations rather than gradual and natural developments. Then, when the main character did carry on real conversations with others, I found that I didn't particularly like her; for someone who had read A Wrinkle in Time a hundred times, she showed remarkably little curiosity about the puzzles posed by time travel and preferred to scornfully dismiss the topic as \\"too weird\\" than to have fun imagining the possible implications. And when time travel did make an appearance in the story itself, the revelations felt almost anti-climactic after the elaborate build-up. There just wasn't enough complexity there. I was especially disappointed when the promised explanation for one character's strange behaviour turned out to have nothing to do with the main mystery at all, but instead was an exaggerated reaction to one of those \\"grand revelations\\" that apparently determined the course of all relationships.<br /><br />Overall, this wasn't a bad book, but I don't think I'd recommend it.
B000NQRE0K|5.0|If you like Mel Gibson this movie is a must have. Great story line, great acting by everyone involved. May be the best directed movie ever, by Mel himself of course. I already had it on DVD but wanted it one Blu-ray. The picture and sound quality are much better than the DVD. Not the best quality picture I have seen on Blu-ray but noticeably better than the DVD. The extras are much better than whats on the DVD. Mel worked his ars off making this movie. He was lucky he did not end up in the hospital in the process. Now Amazon needs to put some of Mel's other Blu-ray titles on sale. We Were Soldiers, Patriot etc.

0765348276|4.0|Many people have compared OLD MAN'S WAR to the works of Robert Heinlein, and this comparison is apt. Scalzi writes in a Golden Age style, focusing his text almost entirely on dialogue, scientific or sociological explanations, and brief scenes of action; most of the dialogue is also there to explain scientific, technological, or military subjects. There is very little visual description, and almost no emotion, so that even though Scalzi tells you what is going on, you can neither see nor feel it. If this is a shortcoming of the book (and I think it is) it is an artifact of the old fashioned style, and probably intentional.     John Perry, the hero and narrator, enlists in the Colonial Defense Force on his 75th birthday. He's transported off the earth and given a new and improved body. This is Scalzi's Idea #1: old folks bring a lifetime of experience to the army, and they are less likely to question their predicament -- after all, they've already lived one life, and this new one is just a bonus, even if it involves unquestioning loyalty to the military and participation in endless wars. What have they got to lose? A further effect of this is that the soldiers of the CDF are not entirely human: their bodies are augmented with implanted computers, artificial blood, and improved speed and strength. They're fighting to make the galaxy safe for the human race, even as they've given up their own humanity.     More memorable, for me anyway, is Scalzi's Idea #2: that the galaxy is a hostile place, swarming with aliens who want to kill us, eat us, and colonize our planets. Habitable worlds are such hot real estate that diplomacy and peaceful relations are basically unheard of. War is brutal and totally without mercy. This is a pretty pessimistic outlook, and also a fairly unusual one. However, Scalzi is a good enough writer that he brings this up in the text. Characters frequently engage in discussions about the ethical and moral consequences of their actions, and those of the CDF -- with such an advanced army, war is easier than diplomacy -- and Scalzi generally allows them to argue their points intelligently and doesn't take sides. In this way he improves on Heinlein, who would have turned each discussion into a one-sided lecture. Ultimately, however, Scalzi lets himself be seduced by the simplicity of the grunt's-eye-view tale, and never really deals with the moral issues in the text itself: the third act of the book is a fairly conventional military adventure, and the climax is contrived from the outcome of an important mission. A more promising thread involving Perry meeting a \\"ghost\\" soldier cloned from his dead wife gets left for the sequel.     OLD MAN'S WAR works, despite its flaws, because it does what few recent science fiction novels have tried to do. It refuses to distract its readers with details of plot, setting, or character, and instead gets right into its premise in a straightforward and unadorned manner. Its greatest strength is that it raises all the issues it sets out to raise, and makes it readers think. I'm looking forward to seeing if Scalzi's future novels improve on this format, and if they manage to reconcile their form and content.

006056251X|4.0|I gave this book 3.5 stars, which was lower than most other Lisa Klepas books I've read and reviewed. I found it very enjoyable, but there were some weak points.<br /><br />This is book 3 in the Wallflower series. Book 1 is Secrets of a Summer's Night and book 2 is It Happened One Autumn. You really need to at least read book 2 before this one, because it provides the back-stories for the main characters. Obviously the series is more enjoyable if read in order.<br /><br />The plot of this one is somewhat poorly paced and most definitely cliched. Evie, a shy and socially awkward young woman marries a known rake, Sebastian, in order to be free of her abusive family at last. Sebastian agrees to marry Evie because her wealthy father is on his death bed, and he plans to use her money to replenish his dwindling fortune. The catch to the deal is that Evie wants nothing to do with Sebastian after the wedding night, sexually or otherwise, because she's afraid she will fall in love with him and end up hurt. Sebastian initially agrees to this with the assumption that he may still have many extramarital affairs, but soon realizes that he desires only Evie and seeks to seduce her. In addition to the main plot, we have subplots in which Sebastian takes over the running of Evie's father's club, and a disgruntled ex-employee has some grudge against Evie. All of this just barely comes together, and it's very rushed near the end, but for the most part it makes sense and it's entertaining. As for the cliches, they add simplicity and charm even as they make the story predictable.<br /><br />Evie is a somewhat dry character in my opinion. She starts out shy and innocent, and grows a backbone over time, but even after all that there isn't anything to make her stand out from other heroines from similar books. Sebastian is a bit better--he's rough around the edges, but never abusive. He's conflicted, claiming with his words to care for nothing and no one while his actions demonstrate otherwise. I really liked this, and the way he treated Evie was incredibly sweet. The romance ends up being barely above average, though, because it's predictable and the heroine is like a hollow placeholder.<br /><br />I was also a bit disappointed that the other wallflowers were mostly absent from this book. showing up only occasionally and not as a full group until the end. In the previous books part of what drove the plot and made the reading worthwhile was the friendship between the girls.<br /><br />I still enjoyed this book for the fact that it continues a series I love.

B0018QOIXU|3.0|Chasing Pavements is by far the best song on here.  She has a unique, soft voice with great range.  The lyrics are catchy and the beats on some of the songs are really good. However, it lacks the edge of a Kate Nash.  Overall, good for those who like a more mainstream British female singer.
B000654OUG|5.0|When speaking of Schubert's keyboard output, for many years I have counted - among the living pianists - only Alfred Brendel and Radu Lupu on my short list of greatest interpreters. Their artistic trajectories and personal gifts seem particularly shaped for the delicate, perfumed melodies and playful rhythms Schubert conjured up so often in his work. Undisputed authorities of the field - considered as such by both specialists and audiences across the world - their recitals and recordings programming the Viennese composer's opuses (mostly Sonatas but also Impromptus, Moment musicaux, Klavierst&uuml;cke, German Dances, Scherzos, Lieders) are always eagerly anticipated events.<br /><br />However, I must gladly admit my short list has slightly enlarged lately. Since this CD box set arrived, in my preferences Mitsuko Uchida has definitely - and definitively! - gathered this select group of accomplished Schubertians bringing her unique and inspired insight to a delightful music for ages. So no surprise that now she enjoys a privileged place among them.<br /><br />The outstanding result of these records - imbued with Uchida's superclass artistry - once more testifies her long run devotion to the Viennese music and her genuine commitment to value its everlasting treasures. This determination borders on a burning passion - I dare say even a fascination - with classical music riches, that only great artists can utterly experience to finally share it with us. Just remember her Mozart complete concertos and sonatas, as well the traversal of Beethoven concertos and - the more recently released - two discs comprising Titan's late sonatas. All these achievements could well have been explained by her musical training in Vienna some five decades ago, by the Imperial Capital mood that impregnated her ever since, by the high-spirited atmosphere so vivid over there. Yet, I think her passion stems from a deeper empathy with true values and their irresistible flair. Available - as all weknow - only in the immortal masterpieces, most abundantly grouped in the XIXth century.<br /><br />Once assumed the axiology, Schubert could well be one of the first choices for a lifelong partnership. Each of the sonatas recorded here unfolds its own character, its unique charm. Uchida commands a high-quality pianism in which the virtuosity is just a connotation - not a goal by itself - while the lyricism gets through with clarity and naturalness. The sonatas breathe an amazing fresh air - think of the ones in E flat major (D 568) or D major (D 850) - whilst the German Dances or the other short pieces (Moments musicaux D 780) exhibit a pleasurable and light-hearted flavour, all so fittingly featuring Uchida's skills. How lively the melodic lines combine, born from one another, developing calm reveries and delicate emotions arisen amidst the most intense upsurges of romantic fervour - as the case is in the great A minor Sonata (D 784) - or bleak soliloquies, like - for instance - in the second movement of the A major Sonata (D 959), where a restrained noble tristesse emerges through a sober and discrete - yet fondling - finger-work.<br /><br />All these Schubert discs were recorded by Mitsuko Uchida in the renowned Golden Hall at Musikverein in Vienna, during five years of peak artistry in her fifties and issued as individuals in their time. At a worthy price, this box set storing all 8 CDs is a not-to-be-missed collector item.
B000002MU3|4.0|REM pretty much put aside their folk influences on \\"Monster\\".  Instead they used as their launching pad classic rock from the 60's and 70's - Velvet Underground, Lou Reed, David Bowie, Stones, and a little early punk - to make a loud rock album, with a twist to the left.  This is announced by the opening electric guitar chords of the first track, \\"What's The Frequency, Kenneth?\\"  My favorite tracks are \\"Crush With Eyeliner\\" (dark and murky) and \\"Bang And Blame\\" (a topic we all can relate to).  \\"Tongue\\", with its falsetto vocal, sounds like a slowed-down version of The Stones' \\"Emotional Rescue\\".  Two other very good tracks are \\"I Took Your Name\\" (similar to \\"Crush With Eyeliner\\") and \\"Circus Envy\\" (punk influence apparent).  OK now, almost every good album has at least one bad track on it, and this one is no exception.  \\"Let Me In\\", to me, is just a wall of noise with little musicality in it.  But, that's why we have the \\"FF\\" and \\"Next Track\\" buttons.  The final track, \\"You\\", is back on the right path.  It is long and solemn with musical effects that I can only describe as \\"futuristically psychedelic\\".  This album is good rock fun from a talented band that dared to experiment.

Worth the money a must have for all Byrds fans.Some of the out takes are better than the originals. the cover of Carol King's GOING BACK in the bonus tracts has a definite southern twang in the vocals Gram Parson maybe? Crosby's TRIAD, & Hillman's DRAFT MORNING are classics
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I looked a lot for this blu-ray version of Planet Earth.  Some other versions do not have the male voice as the narrator, instead it is Sanguinary Weaver.  There are also other kinds of quality out there of the actual blu-ray.  From the reviews that I read, this was the best one.  I am happy with Planet Earth, and I gave it to my father for Christmas this year.  I would warn though, that this one is a four disc set.  My roommate has the normal DVD version (not blu-ray) and it has five discs in it.  The fifth disc is titled \\"The Future\\", and this version does not have that disc.  However, the run time of the dvd is the same as well, so \\"The Future\\" may have just been a bonus at the time for the normal DVD version.  I'm very happy with this purchas
0307388921|5.0|I absoutely love this book! Chuck Palahnuik is an incredible author. I think this one may be my favorite of all his works.
B000VR824S|5.0|There's a lot of various artists here, all top notch. Some of them were superb while others were only excellent. I liked the banjo back ground in the segways  between the bands and interviews. The intro gave a feeling of what it might sound like to be playing that banjo back when the blues was being forged. I thought this was very well conceived and portrayed. It can also be skipped through, although some of the songs seem to start abruptly. The audio is as good as it gets for standard DTS or PCM stereo. The video is also outstanding and as good it gets for standard DVD. My only complaint is \\"Why is this NOT on Blu-ray with DTS Master Audio?\\" It would be unfair to subtract anything for it NOT being Blu-ray I knew it was a DVD when I bought it. It just goes to show how good you can really be not being a slave to substance, kind of like a reverse Woodstock.  Yes I know some really good stuff was left out, but maybe they'll put it on the Blu-ray edition. This one is a no-brainier!! Buy it, Enjoy it, Live it!!<br /><br />I wish Amazon had a 3 Criteria rating that would make for a quicker and more accurate rating of Cd's, DVD's and Blu-ray's.<br /><br />1. Performance<br />2. Quality of Audio<br />3. Quality of Video (for DVD's and Blu-ray's)<br /><br />1.*****<br />2.*****<br />3.*****<br /><br />Bands that wish to have there performances recorded and recognised should be held to a standard. Poor audio, no matter how good the performance, is still a bad product. Those who would still purchase sub-standard audio quality recordings and rank that product highly are not doing the industry or the band justice. Demand better and we will get, it settle for less and that's what you'll get.

B002MEW7YY|3.0|Seems that the best Lucias are not borne in the MET...<br />This production begins with some good prognostics, but gained less and less momentum as the story moves on, culminating in the big chaotic sextet scene.<br />The final bit of Edgardo singing by the grave with the ghost of Lucia approaching is perhaps the best bit that this production could offer.<br />I don't know if La Trebka is a coloratura or not - I am not an expert in this field. However, I have seen and heard her in much better performances in bel canto than this one, viz. the Bellini opera on Youtube with Joyce Didonato. Here, despite having the right sort of timbre, her Lucia failed to take flight both vocally and dramatically, despite all her effort. The first aria (or duet) is some what ordinary in that Netrebko failed to tackle the underlying psychological complexities of Lucia. Hers is a straight-laced portrayal. The inner struggles, the uncertainties, put in juxtaposition with her overwhelming love for Edgardo, are simply not there.<br />I tend also to agree that vocally this is not Netrebko's best performance. May be she has other nights when she sang better Lucias at the MET's production, but definitely not in this recording. Her runs are a bit approximate, and the high notes not really as secure as she would have them elsewhere.<br />The male leads fare much better. Kwiecien is a very evil Enrico, while Beczala is a very tragic Edgardo. Both singers are from Poland, it seems.<br />The staging aren't really that bad, with a Scottish countryside backdrop that befits the story well. It is only the direction that caused trouble:<br />why should Enrico and Lucia row on the floor? If Lucia is a child that readily engages in browls with her brother, she would have fled with Edgardo instead of submitting to the torture. Then, of course, the unwitting photographer that wasn't in the score - it throws some light on the mindset of the director - that this whole thing is JUST FOR SHOW. And that tells a lot.
B001OQCV6K|3.0|I am not a Sherlock Holmes scholar.<br /><br />I KNOW of him, in the sense that I know that he's the fictional father of forensic science, was often portrayed with a deerstalker hat, pipe, and cape, and had a well meaning if bumbling sidekick known as Watson.  He was also very British, a fact that looms large in this new interpretation of Holmes.<br /><br />Holmes skill, and by proxy his creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, orbited around the fundamentals of British society, something I think we Americans don't always appreciate.  The notion that you can tell something about a man by the way he dresses, by the stains on his shirt, by the way he walks, by the inclination of his head or how he swings his arms, all feed into the insidious belief that one does not rise above one's class.  This is part of Holmes' brilliance in penetrating disguises and deceptions - the bad guys can pretend to be someone else, but their true nature gives them away.<br /><br />Viewed through this lens, this latest incarnation of Sherlock Holmes (played with beleaguered smugness by Robert Downey Jr.) gives us glimpses of the society that helped shape him.  We understand that Holmes can spot a tobacco stain, chalk dust, or a shoe scuff - but not the reasons that such details are intuitively obvious to a man of Holmes' intellect and perception.  He's paying attention to things that the society of his time took for granted.<br /><br />The plot revolves around Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), a cultist capable of manipulating a secret society into believing that he can survive even the hangman's noose. The name is reminiscent of Algernon Blackwood, the author of the horror classic, The Wendigo, and a member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The Golden Dawn manifests in the film as \\"The Temple of the Four Orders.\\" Blackwood's sinister influence is perhaps more appropriately attributed to Aleister Crowley.  The secret society is significant, because it blurs the social boundaries, with members from across high society (even Americans!). This is simply intolerable, and we look to Holmes to set the social order straight once more.<br /><br />Guy Ritchie is no fool - he knew that to make Holmes palatable to Americans the Holmes myth would need to be punched up (literally).  So all the vices, all the physical prowess, and all the eccentricities of Holmes are in full display here - his lack of tidiness, his familiarity with the marital art bartitsu, and his obsession with Irene Adler. There is evidence that all these elements existed in the Holmes canon.  They were of course revealed gradually, whereas the film throws them all into the pot at once.  Whether or not this is a good thing depends on your appreciation for pulp.<br /><br />The pulp film style - non-stop action interspersed with little explanation - is in full force.  Victorian England isn't explained; it's simply on display in all its gritty glory. The extras are really ugly, brutish caricatures while the leads are almost luminescent in their cleanliness and pearly-white teeth. Adler being the prime example (played by the delicious Rachel McAdams).<br /><br />McAdams seems woefully out of her depth.  While her character is supposedly so wily as to be the only woman to give Holmes a run for his money, it's established very early that Holmes has the upper hand.  In fact, their relationship comes off as something of a schoolboy crush - understandable, but not quite a worthy foil for Holmes.<br /><br />Downey is his usually disheveled, recovering-addict self.  It's clear Downey's become the new go-to man for playing characters that closely parallel his own real-life troubles, and the actor inhabits them ably.  Maybe a little too much so - the infernal \\"Downey mumble\\" is in full effect here--sometimes I can't make out a single word of what he was saying.<br /><br />The real standout is Jude Law as Watson.  Law's refined yet frustrated Watson grounds Holmes, as he should.  He also upstages Downey with his easy British eloquence. This version of Watson is no fool but a worthy equal, establishing a buddy-cop vibe to the film.<br /><br />Ritchie's cinematography is practically a character unto itself.  Whether he's showing Holmes' calculating his attacks in slow motion or zooming through carriage and across cobblestones, he manages to encompass all of Victorian England with a sweep of the camera.  It's a testament to Ritchie's skill that the film doesn't drag despite its long running time.<br /><br />Loud, violent, fast-paced, and a little too blas&eacute; in its forensic explanations, Sherlock Holmes is nevertheless entertaining enough to make it worth seeing for fans who know of Holmes by reputation only.  .equal, establishing a buddy-cop vibe to the film.

B001MW0J2O|3.0|If you know me, I hate to use cliches like this, but I suppose it's fitting to say that Animal Collective took the indie world by storm in 2009. Some reviewers and listeners have said this thing is a prophecy for the future of music, will change the way you listen to music, will go down as a landmark American album, yadda yadda yadda. Do I agree with all this? Well...............no. I'm sure the rating will give that all to you. (be prepared for a long, wordy review; this thing can't be adequately reviewed easily)<br /><br />I will say that this is definitely the Collective's best album yet, and they seem to be getting better with every album. But many of the band's problems still remain unfixed. There are two big, big problems with this album, and I suppose this band in general. The first one is, I can think of very few AnCo(the new abbreviation B) ) songs that were not as good as the first time you heard it. Alot of their stuff simply do not hold up in repeated listens. I know many people have said that the more you listen to the songs the more hidden sounds and layers will be presented to you. Well even if that's true, that doesn't always increase one's appreciation for the song in question. Quite a bit of these songs just become uninteresting. For example, even the huge dynamic change in In The Flowers, which I thought was just amazing when I first heard it, now only holds my interest for maybe 45 seconds. Maybe it's my problem, maybe I'm just ADD for the music these guys try to make. Nevertheless, that's how I feel about it.<br /><br />And the second big problem for the album/band(which I suppose is connected to the first) is, the band's music has never been that endearing or memorable to me, and that seems to be the complete antithesis to nearly everyone else's personal reception. There's just not that many times when I feel that a song is worth every single second it took to listen to it. Perhaps the only songs that lifted themselves up from both these problems is Taste and Bluish(in fact songs 5-9 is probably the best part of the CD) which if anything have gotten better as time went along. My Girls is a song that I really wrestle with, because some days I can be really into it, and some days I get really bored with it.<br /><br />Now, I've talked about the negatives, now I'll talk positives. After all, I am giving this a 3, not a 1. You will never, ever mistake this album for anything else you'll probably ever hear. It is an entity of it's own, and a true \\"indie\\" album, which we don't see much anymore. I'm not saying that the band doesn't have their influences, but they also have a sound completely of their own, and I can do nothing but completely respect that. These songs are very, very layered, so it shows that this album was truly labored over, and at times it hits these truly epic, exhilirating moments. And one problem of the band it has done away with(except for Daily Routine, which is actually pretty cool), is they no longer have overlong songs that are just explorations into nothingness that seem to drift on forever. That has always been the least interesting thing about the band, and the songs that do that have never seemed to serve any purpose to me.<br /><br />So as you can see, my opinion on this thing is anything if not mixed. But as I said, this is their best album so far, and they seem to be getting better with every one, so maybe next time around I'll be closer to getting on board. (I've said that Panda Bear's solo record Person Pitch is one of my favorite albums of the decade, so that can only show that these guys have the potential to really win me over). As for now, we got this, and I haven't felt so intrigued by an album in a long time. When's the last time I had to make one of my reviews this long? Even if I didn't like it nearly as much as everyone else does, it's still a very interesting venture for any adventurous music listener.Bluish(in fact songs 5-9 is probably the best part of the CD) which if anything have gotten better as time went along.

B000RZGFYS|4.0|Reign in Blood is every bit as intense and heavy as it was back in 1986. \\"Raining Blood\\" and \\"Angel of Death\\" are in my opinion the strongest songs on the album.  This album is great from top to bottom and deserves 5 stars...however the reason for the 4 stars is the highly cheesy \\"Altar of Sacrafice\\".  All I have to say is Spinal Tap would be proud of this track. If you feel like hearing some intense metal listen to the rest of the album and avoid \\"Altar\\" at all costs.
B000SEGCRS|3.0|The book is not completely useless.  You can \\"extract\\" a few tips from the book.  However, al books of this author (yes, I've read them all) are lacking a basic order.  It looks like the author never bothered to put things together, simply writing about anything that comes to his mind.  For example, he writes about sharp pictures, then, once he gets to a word \\"flash\\", he completely switches from the main subject and keeps writing about different kind of flashes you can get from one particular store.  Then, while talking about flashes, he gets to white balance, or something else, and keeps talking about that totally different subject.  Then, the wedding comes to his mind.  Ok, here we go, we talk about weddings, which get us to making sharp pictures, which leads to flashes and lenses, etc., etc. etc.  Repetitions, repetitions, repetitions...   The \\"jokes\\" are very distracting.  While reading many things, I was thinking: \\"what is he talking about, is he out of his mind?\\" then you realize: \\"ah, that was a joke\\".  Silly.

0385504225|3.0|I finished the book last night. I found myself skim reading the last fifty pages saying to myself blah, blah,blah. It seems Dan Brown has developed a formula for his novels and he sticks doggedly to it. I mean really, the last two novels brought Langdon back from death, fool me once shame on you; fool me twice shame on me.<br /> In Lost Symbol, Mr. Brown let his research and facts get in the way of the story. There was too much and it went way beyond the climax.He needs to get a better editor or one that's willing to point out the flaws in his novel.<br />  There were some real plausibility issues at the end of the book. Here we have the Solomons, one drained of most of her blood and the other with a severed hand, both of whom have just seen Peter's son killed by shards of glass, and they decide to take Langdon on a tour of the capitol building? Come on!<br />  The novel had great potential, but it let me down. It would have been great with a hundred pages taken out and the writing fine tuned. Please don't forget about the your readers, Mr Brown.
3822837849|5.0|This book is a delightful look into the past of Photography and through what better lens than the publications of Alred Stieglitz. It so sell shows you the styles and aspirations of the photograher of the early 20th century and the expectations of the photographers clients during that eara.    It also reminded me of the days before digital when I shot 8\\" x 10\\" and 4 x 5\\" formats that the making of a really good photograph is in part the time of setting up and having time to really think out the shot.    The compositions and posing of the portrait subjects really have improved my ability to see and think the making of my photographs.    The book is a very good investment and for the price it is a steal.    Darryl
B0026P3G12|4.0|As everyone now knows, Ms. Boyle became a household word overnight with her turn on \\"Britain's Got Talent\\" and the rest, as they say, is history.  I find it difficult to separate her from her album because it took incredible courage to get up and sing in front of a critical audience, particularly for a woman who has spent her life in obscurity and fading dreams.  I purchased the album because of my admiration for that courage when she reached out and grabbed the brass ring, but I didn't know what to expect.  First I want to say \\"Well done Susan on releasing your first album!\\" But......my major criticism of this album is the song selections. Although some of the songs are reflections of her personal history and very suitable for her voice (e.g. I Dreamed a Dream, You'll See, and Who I Was Born To Be), others do not take advantage of the room-filling depth of her voice and she ends up sounding weak or saccharine (Wild Horses, How Great Thou Art, Daydream Believer, The End of the World). I don't like having Christmas songs mixed into a regular album because, let's face it, by the end of Christmas we are all ready to ditch the Christmas songs for the next year. While I think that an eclectic mix makes an album interesting, the mix of songs on this album is a bit schizoid.  The old fashioned religious songs like How Great Thou Art and Amazing Grace seem out of place here, and How Great Thou Art is pale and uninteresting when compared to Cry Me A River and Madonna's \\"You'll See\\" and will bore her younger fans, while the covers borrowed from more modern pop/rock will not be enjoyable to the older members of her audience. Other songs, like DayDream Believer, are dragging and have lost the rhythm and flow in the original recorded by the Monkees and instead of sounding sweet sound depressed.  Overall, it is a sampler, I suspect, of Ms. Boyle's favourite songs and some which the producers wanted her to do.  As a sampler it is fine, but I came away wishing for more songs with strength and power, such as Celine Dion sings.  Hopefully, she will be able to do further albums which take advantage of her love for traditional Christian songs and she can do specialty albums such as church songs and Christmas songs in dedicated albums which will satisfy those niche audiences. All-in-all I enjoyed this album, but I put the songs I liked on a CD to listen to in my car so I don't have to keep skipping the songs I found boring.trength and power, such as Celine Dion sings.

142313494X|4.0|This first book in the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series is a great start to the saga.  The quality of the writing and the vocabulary is excellent, and Percy's style of narration is easy to go along with, and for readers to identify with.  There are plenty of action scenes featuring numerous creatures, and the quest that forms the central part of the book takes the action from Long Island to Los Angeles.    If there was a fault, the book slows down a little towards the start as Percy gets to Half-Blood Hill, a training camp for the offspring of gods.  But it soon picks up again as he and his companions Grover, a satyr, and Annabeth make the trek out west to discover who has stolen Zeus's lightning bolt.  There are some surprises in store, and the story keeps the reader guessing right until the end.
0446569895|4.0|Everybody knows Ozzy Osbourne in one way or another -- classic satanic rocker, burned-out family man, or whatever.<br /><br />So he tries to incorporate a little of everything in \\"I Am Ozzy,\\" a rough'n'tumble autobiography full of all the embarrassing, unflattering, sometimes bizarre details of his life. It takes awhile to get used to his rambling style, but these stories have an unpolished brand of charm... and he's undoubtedly had an interesting life.<br /><br />John \\"Ozzy\\" Osbourne was born into a working-class, impoverished British family, had a miserable stint at school, and seemed destined for \\"manual labor or manual labor.\\" Instead, he went to prison.<br /><br />Fortunately for Black Sabbath fans, that isn't where the story ends. After hearing the Beatles and Fleetwood Mac, he became enamored of the rock'n'roll life... albeit a darker, weirder side than the hippie-dippie stuff that was popular at the time. And after a few failed bands, he got into a true, brilliant band that was later named Black Sabbath, hated by critics and much beloved by music fans.<br /><br />He got married, had sex with groupies (in that order), went on Top of the Pops, encountered satanic freakfans, and produced a slew of albums with Black Sabbath. Lots of booze and drugs. As you'd expect, both he and the band started spiralling out of control. But after quitting it, he got involved with his future second wife Sharon, and launched out on a new life of music, madness, sex, dove-biting, bat-biting and -- most horribly -- reality TV.<br /><br />Honestly, I didn't much care for \\"I Am Ozzy\\" during the first few chapters. The combination of a misspent youth and Osbourne's rambling style gave me a bit of a headache. But after awhile, his life story starts to grow on you -- his stories became funnier and more bizarre (how he almost killed a vicar with a hash cake) and his meandering way of recounting the past begins to flow more easily.<br /><br />And since this is Ozzy Osbourne, he's got a LOT of freaky stories, so the book feels like sitting down and listening to the old guy natter about the Bad Ol' Days. Some are filthy, some are crazy, and some are just plain hilarious (`There's this incredible new thing. It's American and it's called pizza!\\"). And he writes in a rough-hewn, unpretentious style that meanders all over the place, but has charm.<br /><br />Of course, it's got the F-word sprinkled through it hundreds and hundreds of times. What else would you expect?<br /><br />And to his credit, Osbourne is unafraid to admit to the uglier parts of his life -- he was a burglar, he fired shotguns at small animals, and he cheated on Wife #1, as well as other sundry regrets. He's also pleasantly down-to-earth about his music, even when people didn't like it or didn't get it (\\"Are you sure they didn't make a mistake, son?\\" \\"What d'you mean?\\" \\"This cross is upside down\\").<br /><br />It took a little while to grow on me, but \\"I Am Ozzy\\" ends up being an R-rated funride through the nasty world of rock and drugs -- the good, the bad, and the really gross.ing down and listening to the old guy natter about the Bad Ol' Days.

0064407667|4.0|The title A Bad Beginning could be taken in two ways.  Firstly, the fate of the children in the story, and secondly, the writing itself.  That is not to say the book is terrible.  It hums along at a fair pace, and the narrative is done in an entertaining, jocular style.  But the story, at 150 pages of largish type, is little more than a skeleton, with little to flesh it out.  Everything is told plainly and simply - which might make it suitable for younger children - but the subject matter is dark - dead parents, physical abuse of children and a man attempting to marry a 14 year old.  Parents should review the book ahead of time to decide if it is suitable material for their children.
1840220554|5.0|Jane Austen. Her name is practically synonymous with classic, understated romance, as well as comedies of manners with a subtle, sly sense of humor.<br /><br />And Austen's \\"The Complete Novels\\" brings together the full complement of her finished novels, from the little-known \\"Lady Susan\\" to the classic bestseller \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" (and everything in between). This collection is flled with lovably flawed heroines, beautiful formal prose, and some rather unconventional love stories.<br /><br />\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" become a problem when Elizabeth Bennett takes a dislike to the handsome, aloof Mr. Darcy -- and her prejudice against him builds after he sabotages her sister's love match, and the charming Wickham drops some shocking claims about Darcy's nastiness. But the facts are very different -- and when scandal hits the Bennett family, Darcy may be their only hope. And \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" clash when the two very different Dashwood sisters, smart Elinor and romantic Marianne, both fall in love -- one with a man she can't have, and the other with a guy who may be horribly unsuitable.<br /><br />Anne Elliott has a problem with \\"Persuasion,\\" since she was once engaged to the impoverished sailor Frederick Wentworth, but was persuaded to break it off. Now he's returned from war as a wealthy hero... and Anne still loves him. \\"Mansfield Park\\" is the backdrop for shy Fanny's life with her rich relatives, who usually treat her as a servant -- except for her kindly cousin, Edmund. But when the flirtatious, fashionable Crawfords arrive in the neighborhood, it unbalances the lives of everyone at Mansfield Park.<br /><br />And \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a fitting location for Austen's spoof on gothic romances, in which the hyperimaginative Catherine Moreland is taken under the wing of the Tilney family, and especially handsome Henry -- and learns a lesson about the difference between fantasy and reality. \\"Emma\\" is a frothy romantic comedy about a rich, somewhat spoiled young lady who tries to arrange the lives of people around her so that everyone is happy. The problem is, life isn't that simple -- and neither is love. And as an addition to Austen's main body of work, this edition includes the novella \\"Lady Susan,\\" who is sort of the evil sociopathic twin of Emma -- a brilliant and manipulative widow who seduces, plots and schemes. Yummy stuff.<br /><br />The omnibus collection displays the range and depth of Austen's writing skill beautifully; though each story is very unique they're laced together by common themes. Except for \\"Lady Susan,\\" each story is a love story, tempered with some clever commentary on the society of Austen's day (example: entailment, which plays a part in several plots), and a biting, sharp-edged wit (the mockery of the toadying Mr. Collins and the obnoxious Elliott family).<br /><br />And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen painted her stories vividly -- there's a bit of roughness in \\"Lady Susan\\" and \\"Persuasion,\\" but nothing too dramatic. Each one has powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"), as well as deliciously witty dialogue (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But she also weaves in some intensely romantic moments as well (\\"Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman, that his love has an earlier death. I have loved none but you\\").<br /><br />Austen also had an interesting range of heroines -- quiet ones, melodramatic ones, intelligent ones, naive ones, and mildly spoiled ones who think they know best. But each one has a major character flaw that must be overcome before she can find true love and happiness And she has an equally fascinating range of love interests: the quiet shy Colonel Brandon, the sexy and clever Henry Tilney, the blunt Mr. Knightley, the generous and honest Edmund, and especially the smart, sexy Mr. Darcy (who has a flaw of his own to overcome alongside Lizzie).<br /><br />Jane Austen's \\"Complete Novels\\" draws together all her finished novels, and let readers explore the mannered society and obstacle-filled love lives of her heroines.).<br /><br />Jane Austen's \\"Complete Novels\\" draws together all her finished novels, and let readers explore the mannered society and obstacle-filled love lives of her heroines.
B002SVBDYQ|4.0|This film have excellent choice of music. My favorite is Band of Skulls \\"Friends\\" and Lykke Li \\"Possibility\\". I'm a alternative/punk rock fan but I do enjoy the music in this soundtrack.
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|It's my understanding that Clint Eastwood intends to \\"hang up his spurs\\" as far as acting goes. Not that anyone could possibly blame him. This film the best I've seen in quite some time. Other reviewers talked about the bigotry but I see it more as diversity & cultural misunderstanding & how it can be overcome given the opportunity. It also shows that our country is changing rapidly & will probably never be the same.<br /><br />I learned a lot about the Hmong people that I wasn't aware of before, it even made me do a little more research about them. They are an amazing culture. I like the fact that most of the actors were native Hmong which gave the film a sense of realism, as well as the fact that it was filmed \\"on location\\" as opposed to Hollywood. All of the casting was superior.<br /><br />I have noticed a lot of thinly veiled references to many of Mr. Eastwood's prior films in this one which I found very amusing. I'd swear that \\"Daisy\\" is the same dog from \\"Outlaw Josey Wales\\" (gladly he didn't spit on her head - but the scene with Grandma was priceless!) The relationship with Grandma seemed familiar (even though she didn't speak English) to Granny from \\"Outlaw\\" (mutual tolerance). There was also some \\"tobacco-spitting\\" included). It seemed like some of the character from \\"Heartbreak Ridge\\" was in Walt, just maybe later in life. There might have been a small amount of \\"Dirty Harry\\" in there as well. Watch it & I think you'll see what I'm talking about.<br /><br />Even though there is a lot of sadness in this film, there is also an abundance of classic humor as well. The way Walt used \\"Toad\\" to pay back his \\"debt\\" was priceless (\\"wasp nest, now that's terrible\\")! The barbershop scene was also great!<br /><br />The scene in the basement (during the party) begs the question: What does it say about our society when an 80 year old terminally ill man has to level a dryer when there is a room full of young able bodied young men watching him do it? Where will we be when there aren't any more \\"Walt's\\" left?<br /><br />This film also depicts a lot of the problems that our own culture has (family interaction, etc.) It was really disgusting the way that Walt's family treated him but sadly it's too commonplace these days.<br /><br />Every time I watch this film it makes me sad that it will most likely be the last time we'll see Mr. Eastwood in front of the camera... Every time I watch the movie I feel that he's trying to tell us something more (about himself personally?).  If you are a are a fan of Mr. Eastwood (or even if you're not) this is a \\"Must See\\" movie... I would give it more than 5 stars if I could!n there aren't any more \\"Walt's\\" left?<br /><br />This film also depicts a lot of the problems that our own culture has (family interaction, etc.) It was really disgusting the way that Walt's family treated him but sadly it's too commonplace these days.<br /><br />Every time I watch this film it makes me sad that it will most likely be the last time we'll see Mr. Eastwood in front of the camera...

B002SJIO4A|4.0|As \\"District 9\\" opens, we learn that a mysterious spaceship has been hovering over Johannesburg, South Africa since 1982.  After years of trying unsuccessfully to integrate the more than a million aliens who arrived on it into regular society, government officials have decided to move them out of the slum, known as District 9, where they now reside, to District 10, a camp located far away from the city (the creatures are derisively referred to as \\"Prawns,\\" due to their crustacean-like appearance).  Trouble begins when Wikus Van De Merwe, a field operator for the MNU (Multinational United), becomes exposed to a mysterious alien substance while in the process of evacuating the camp, a substance that causes him to slowly turn into a Prawn himself.  Immediately, the MNU wants to dissect him to better understand how to operate the aliens' weaponry (for some reason human DNA renders the weapons useless in human hands).  However, Wikus escapes and becomes a fugitive from justice, finally hooking up with an alien who may possibly be able to help him retrieve his full humanity.  (Though set in South Africa, the movie`s provenance is actually New Zealand).<br /><br />Shot partly in the style of a you-are-there documentary and partly as a conventional third-person narrative, this relatively low-budget ($30 million) thriller, written by Neil Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell and directed by Blomkamp, is high on creativity, raw energy and imagination and low on sci-fi movie cliches (the overused fugitive-on-the-run scenario being one of the few concessions it makes in that regard).  \\"District 9\\" also provides more food-for-thought than the average big-budget movie in this genre.  Like \\"Alien Nation,\\" it uses the arrival of outer space visitors to weave a thought-provoking parable about such relevant social issues as prejudice, governmental and corporatist secrecy and propaganda, black market exploitation of the masses, and xenophobia.  The script also deviates from the standard formula by making the aliens neither pointy-headed super-intellectuals light years ahead of us in knowledge, nor unthinking villains bent on colonization and destruction, nor namby-pamby sentimentalists reaching out a hand of friendship from across the cosmos.  They are just worker drones who happened to get stranded on a strange planet, whose generally compassionate inhabitants invited them to stay on - albeit clearly as second-class citizens, as it turns out.  The movie also captures some of the poignancy of the 1986 version of \\"The Fly,\\" as piece by piece, Wikus loses the one thing that defines what he is - his humanity.  Yet, ironically it is in becoming less human - in being able to more fully identify with an \\"other\\" to the point of extraordinary self-sacrifice - that he becomes most human (a theme not unlike the one in \\"Avatar,\\" actually).<br /><br />Even with all its impressive CGI effects and hardware, \\"District 9\\" would not be half the movie it is without the extraordinary performance of Sharlto Copley who, as Wikus, provides the human heartbeat the picture needs to be effective.  A somewhat bumbling, barely competent bureaucrat is not an obvious choice for an action movie hero, but Copley makes that very tricky transition seem utterly natural and seamless.  Wikus is a good-hearted man who's forced by circumstances to perform actions he wouldn't normally perform just to survive, yet he remains true to his moral code most of the way through.  It is he and he alone who lifts \\"District 9\\" to the level of compelling human drama.<br /><br />Excellent special effects, exciting action sequences, some subtle social satire (particularly in the early stretches) and moments of surprising tenderness all combine to make \\"District 9\\" a one-of-a-kind moviegoing experience.king the aliens neither pointy-headed super-intellectuals light years ahead of us in knowledge, nor unthinking villains bent on colonization and destruction, nor namby-pamby sentimentalists reaching out a hand of friendship from across the cosmos.

We haven't yet watched any of the DVDs that came with it, but we have truely relived our wonderful  Beatle era thru music.  We were extremely satisfied with this order, the price, the timely way it was delivered in a brand new, sealed box and there were no problems at all. Great sale.  Thanks!

B00008977N|5.0|Although the video is not razor sharp (by new 1080p standards) I found this to be an excellent DVD.  Already being a big fan of his music/these songs, it was kind of a no brainer, but the pleasant surprise was the theatric presentation of them and I mean that in a good way.  The opening sequence of \\"Come talk to me\\" with him rising out in a backlight phone booth from beneath the stage was quite dramatic and well done I thought.  If you are a Gabriel fan I give it my vote, if not I still think it is a nicely done DVD.

1594488916|4.0|The Man Who Loved Books Too Much by Allison Hoover Barlett is a fascinating true crime book about a man, John Gilkey, who \\"collects\\" rare books by stealing them. The twist in the story is that Gilkey steals the books not for profit, but for personal edifice. In hot pursuit of Gilkey is rare book dealer Ken Saunders. And rounding out this picture is the author Hoover Barlett who becomes Gilkey's trusted confidant.    The Man Who Loved Books Too Much is an interesting read on two levels. First, as an expose into the rare book world which Hoover Barlett does an excellent job of explaining. She attends famous book fairs and speaks with various dealer victims of Gilkey's. She also plumbs the psyches of the average book collector with whom Gilkey shares many attributes (love of the physical object and desire to collect one type of object).    Next, she probes the depth of Gilkey's psyche as to why he continues to steal rare books when he has been repeatedly caught and imprisoned. Gilkey declares, \\"I like the feeling of having a book worth five or ten grand in my hands. And there's the admiration you're gonna get from other people.\\" The paradox, of course, is that Gilkey cannot display his hot books for admiration nor easily sell them if he chooses to. Gilkey never gains insight into the ultimate futility of his \\"collecting\\" nor the consequences of his actions on himself or others. Like a moth drawn to the flame Gilkey continues to steal and continues to get caught.    The Man Who Loved Books Too Much is a compelling, but ultimately somewhat sad story of an amoral thief.      Review Based on Borrowed Library Book.
B00132D808|5.0|If you're reading this, chances are you're not one of this band's fans, but are likely a, shall we say, \\"more mature\\" music fan acting on a recommendation or a hunch.  My quick tip is that if you like the Beatles, the Beach Boys, ELO, and other '60s and '70s-era orchestrated rock/pop music, you owe it to yourself to get this CD.  It might take you a few listens to thank me, but I think you will.  I think this is an important album in its own way, a brilliant album, inspired and beautiful.  It's become one of my favorite albums.<br /><br />Let's just say I'm waay outside this band's demographic--I'm 47, a rock musician for 30 years, and I tend to listen to \\"musician's music.\\" I look for serious musicianship and songwriting, and I usually ignore emo and other teen styles.  I can't stand Blink 182, Good Charlotte, Jet or Fall Out Boy.  I bought this for my 13-year-old daughter for Christmas after hearing \\"Nine In the Afternoon\\" coming out of her room many times, and thinking it sounded pretty cool.  I've still never heard their first CD, though I like the single.  But since giving Pretty.Odd. a spin to see what the fuss was about, I must admit I am totally blown back by this album.  It does walk a fine line between homage and copy-cat, but I guess it doesn't matter to me--I love it.  I've been recommending it to all my musician buddies, and they're all loving it too.  It's got all the sonic elements of a George Martin-produced mid-late period Beatles album, but with modern recording techniques and equipment.  There have been so many \\"next Beatles\\" tags thrown out there by the media that I stopped paying attention years ago.  All those promises faded into forgettable obscurity.  But I think this one might stand the test of time--though unfortunately the band broke up not long after releasing it.<br /><br />And that's a telling insight into the polarizing nature of this album.  Even the band didn't agree on it.  There are some haters out there, and they seem to come in two main categories: a) younger fans who can't stand that this isn't part 2 of their first album, and; b) people who think it's too much of a Beatles rip-off.  And to be fair, there are plenty of Beatles tropes, from the \\"Get Back\\" beat of Pas De Cheval to the \\"Good Morning\\" horn section of Mad As Rabbits.  The production by Rob Mathes is some of the best I've heard, far beyond a mere George Martin ripoff.  Just Google the guy and check out his credits.  This is a dude who has written piano arrangements for Ray Charles, cello arrangements for Yo Yo Ma, and vocal arrangements for Luciano Pavarotti, just to name a few. If you love the Beatles and think you might be offended by someone sounding like them, I guess this might not float your boat.  But if you love the Beatles I think you've got to at least check this out to see for sure--to me the original sound of this band shines through, giving this album its own unique flavor and flair, but it's a sound you will be instantly comfortable with, like an old pair of Levi's.  To my ear the orchestrations here are even more brilliant and well-integrated into the music than Martin's legendary work on Sgt. Pepper and Magical Mystery Tour (both of which I've owned for many years, and am intimately familiar with).  If you like an album that's full of well-crafted, evocative songs performed flawlessly, and augmented by visionary orchestral arrangement and production, you're gonna like Pretty.Odd.  If you're curious what kind of album George Martin might make today if he had a cutting edge pop band at his disposal, look no further.  This is an album full of instantly catchy toe-tapping songs, that also rewards repeated listenings with a ton of intriguing detail. I'm sure I'll still be listening to this one years, even decades from now.<br /><br />So do yourself a favor, keep an open mind, and pick up a copy of this CD or download it to your Pod.  This is a \\"headphones album,\\" so throw on some good ones, relax and prepare for an experience.  From the very first song you'll be transported to a friendly place you might have thought didn't exist any more--a happy, summery place where the colors are psychedelic and the music makes you smile.  It's kind of old fashioned, sort of brand new. And all good.  You'll be glad you tried it.

B002Y0MQ6A|4.0|I just heard about this movie and since I'm a fan of viral movies and/or Chris Pine, I checked it out! Basic premise is that four travelers are attempting to hit a possibly safe/tucked away location from the lead character's childhood - all the while trying to steer clear of infected people. Naturally, this proves hard to do.<br /><br />One of the things you notice about this film is that the cast is very strong and very believeable. These are just regular people who are just trying to survive as society completely disintegrates and the rules change.  The director made smart choices in my opinion with no few special effects - and thus making the film simply more realistic, barren, and terrifying.  The film raises the question of what would you do if faced with the same situation? And it does make you think.<br /><br />Choices and rules are difficult and they have to be. Chris Pine is very strong in the lead role and it's a great change from his role as Jim Kirk. He still is very charming at times but also reveals he can go the distance emotionally.<br /><br />This is one of the better movies I've seen of this genre in a long time and it's completely worth your time. Seriously.
B002MBAJ4M|2.0|Government Mule , who I have been a big fan of, has been going downhill for a while.  Like a lot of groups I think their creativity is either spent or they feel the need to be mainstream.  The one bright spot in the past few years has been Mighty High (which demonstrated creativity and has some excellent songs on it) and that has mostly reworked/sampled material.  This disc is almost a complete loss - except for some bright moments on the last few songs and they don't even cut it because Warren seems to have some strange desire to break a good groove up with softer pop girlie moments.  My suggestion is that the group figure it out.  Go back to what made you great and different or sell the hell out completely and do more hard pop songs.  Before I go I want to say that the majority of my frustration lies with the other reviewers here.  I bought this CD because of the reviews and the lack of songs to sample.  I took a chance.  Well the majority of you must not know what Gov't Mule is about (Or was about?). This album shows Gov't Mule may be content with the mainstream move it has been on for years and as such maybe the majority of the reviewers who gave this thing a thumbs up have evolved with the band and embrace the \\"new\\" Gov't Mule. I for one do not buy in to that movement and want the bad asses I loved back.

B00008CLOA|5.0|I've known Pink Floyd's album DARK SIDE OF THE MOON for many, many years, but although I've been writing Amazon reviews for nearly a decade, I've always been reluctant to post comments about DARK SIDE. What more can I say after thousands of others? How many people are going to decide whether or not to buy this universally acclaimed classic rock album based on my comments?<br /><br />Well, I might as well dedicate this space to two properties of the album that I've always found peculiar indeed. The first is the way it succeeds not so much based on its musical content (its melodies, harmonies and rhythms -- its tunes abstractly considered) as its atmospheric production. Now, I'm a fan of nearly the whole of Pink Floyd's career, and this album would be fine music regardless of the producer, but Alan Parsons's role is what takes DARK SIDE to a completely new level: the sense of space (the SACD quadrophonic mix is worth it), the warmth of the sound, the plain authenticity of the sampled speech and the flawless mixing of one track into the next. Pink Floyd's music had been more overtly psychadelic in the past, but the exploitation of spatialization makes the trippy moments here more out of this world than ever before. It's almost like the band could be playing anything, but the way the sound comes at you is enough to make it a masterpiece.<br /><br />The second remarkable property that I admire about DARK SIDE OF THE MOON is how behind the times it is in many respects -- that's right, I like how it sounds more in tune with the late 1960s than its 1973 release date. In expressing the vibe of that remarkable period of history that had already sadly passed forever, Pink Floyd created a monument, whereas something more clearly Seventies might have lessened its greatness.

0143036556|4.0|Like his best-selling earlier book, \\"Guns, Germs and Steel,\\" Jared Diamond has written a long, dense, often repetitive book that is nonetheless both fascinating and informative.    In \\"Collapse,\\" Diamond offers lessons from the failures (and less common successes) of past and present societies that have struggled to survive environmental challenges. Sometimes the challenges arise from difficult local conditions, but they are always made worse by societal decisions on the use of resources.    Diamond applies the lessons learned to world environmental problems of today and offers insightful conclusions. His chapters on present day issues in China and Australia are particularly informative. Although the read can be slow because of his writing style, it's a book worth taking the time to absorb.

B002UZXJA6|4.0|A lovely album with some powerful arrangements. I would have liked a little more variety (more uptempo songs) but still a great listen. I have started warming up to Alex and Lynn, who had the thankless job of filling in for the greats, Orla and Meav. I feel they could have been given more solo time to stretch their wings though. Hoping they stick around for the next album/dvd.
6304071906|5.0|This was an excellent accounting of what happened in that infamous time in history.  The actors involved were very real.  The incidents lifelike too.<br />I liked it much better than the more recent movie.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|I am an avid reader and in constant search for great novels. Let the Great World Spin, I can honestly say, is one of the best books I've ever read - masterfully crafted characters with whom all may relate, a realism which makes us laugh while breaking our hearts, and wholly structured in such a way that, after putting this book down, you will think about it for weeks after. McCann creates a spectrum of individuals which the reader is immediately drawn into, then cleanly connects them all; its a novel that will should completely change how you see the girl one on the side of the road or the man in the car beside you.   He captures the human spirit wonderfully.   Please read this novel.

B002RI9ZPY|3.0|Good follow on. What I liked was that the author did not run out of ideas and was able to write three novels of equal intensity. Recommend this book.

B001TD1XWG|5.0|I'll start by saying if your a hardcore fan of only rock this will be total garbage to you. If your a hardcore fan of only rap this will be total garbage to you too. But if your more like me and like both Rock and Rap you will notice that this album is only rock influenced not a rock album but you will like. I'm not mad at Wayne for makeing this cd b/c I think it's one of my favorate albums ever and thats b/c I understand what I'm listening to. This is pretty decent blend of rock, rap and pop all in one cd and I love it.

B000002I97|4.0|Yep. John nailed a few scenes didn't he? I was in Fairhill North Philly when this came out and it was at the height of Nam and the total and complete collapse of the neighborhood from drugs and plant closings. Friends of mine came back with Purple hearts and bruised arms. Thorazine for the brain and Darvon for the pain. Tag and bag and do the shot. From the jungle to the jungle back to the jungle. Couldn't get out of Dodge WITH a ride.<br />John nailed a scene or two.
B0013ND36G|3.0|I got my copy few days ago. Don't expect too much from this 2003 movie and this Blu-ray is just reasonable. Not too much different from my older DVD copy, expect better sounds and sharper. But for under $10, a good buy indeed.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Having watched this special lady evolve from a shy somewhat sheltered life into a star has shown that it can be done.  The quality of the voice is easy to listen to at almost any time. The person behind the voice comes across as a very down to earth person. My hope is to see her make many more records with this close to home sound without being rushed.
B002BFBAWO|4.0|Upon hearing the movie's plot from a friend and the Twilight overnight sensation star Kristen Stewart, I really thought this is just another teenage flick. Although there are some cheeky scenes, it is still better than I expected.<br />The plot is very simple. James(Eisenberg) plays a typical high school graduate who has good grades and has a bright future. He dreams of going to the Big Apple and studying there. But he's broke. He ended up getting a job at a theme park called Adventureland. It kinda looks like a crappy job with kids vomiting, adults cheating for their kids and obnoxious teens on group dates. But when he finally meets his dream girl in co-worker Em (Stewart), everything changed. It isn't a typical teenage love story because there are some twists and conflicts like a secret love affair. (Spoiler, sorry.) Considering this is from Director Greg Mottola, this lacks hilarious scenes like those in Superbad or Knocked Up. But thanks to Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig, who play the couple who runs the park, there are laugh-worthy scenes. There's also a tinge of indie vibe in this film with all those music (especially the music!), the lines and their clothes (that Games, Games, Games gray t-shirt).<br />The thing that impresses me most about this whole movie are both the performances of Eisenberg and Stewart. They fit the characters perfectly. They're so believable. You'll wonder if Eisenberg's really that awkward in real-life and Stewart showed she was just another confused kid.<br />It wasn't that outstanding or Oscar-worthy but what's important is that it entertained. If you liked Juno, you will definitely dig this.
B002VUFKG6|1.0|Obviously, eating, praying and loving didn't work too well, because the author is still a bitter, self-absorbed woman busily over-analyzing every relationship and dreading every possible commitment.  If one has to think this hard about love, marriage, pregnancy or anything, it shouldn't even be a question.  I grew exhausted by the author's mental contortions of whether she and her boyfriend should get married. It was like plucking petals off daisies - he loves me, he loves me not...  The author goes on and on about her relationship and all the great qualities of her boyfriend, which is probably nice for him to read, but exceptionally boring chapter after chapter.  I am honestly trying to figure out what everyone sees in Eat, Pray, Love and this horrid book.
B001UV4XUG|4.0|When you see Romantic Comedy (rom-com) movies in Hollywood, it is so cliche, so predictable, so feel-good. It's like there's this formula that boy meets girl, feels good (or sometimes bad) then eventually, because of a significant episode (be stranded somewhere, go to one of their hometowns, there's a big project at work, etc. etc.), they will soon fall in love... and we all know the rest.<br />500 Days didn't jump into that bandwagon. In fact, it defied the norms of Romantic Comedies. Usually, it is the guy who doesn't believe in love and 'plays the field' and girls are the common usual hopeless romantics. But not in this flick. It's the guy who is trying to find \\"The One\\" and whose heart was broken, who moves on from this heartache. The forward-replay sequence of the days may be weird and confusing to some but this makes it very unique. It shows the contrast of Summer's before and after effect on Tom's life. And I don't think it will be just as striking if it went from Day 1 to Day 500. For me, the ending is very, very promising. Like it would stay in your mind even after the credits are rolling. It's like the ending is also something else's beginning. And the fact that it ended there leaves so many things in the viewers' imagination.<br />The movie had so many fun moments, I could almost relate to my own experiences (although not exactly the same, just as funny as  a memory)- like that game when they were shouting the male organ in a park, the 'morning after' dancing on the park, the guessing of songs by humming it over the phone, the husband-and-wife role playing in the mall. And just as many sad moments like the reality/expectations scene, the last conversation at the 'favorite spot'. I just wasn't showing, but tears were already welling.<br />I also need to commend the witty script, the convincing cast (I really think Joseph Gordon-Levitt is one of Hollywood's most underrated actors) and this movie's ability to make you smile through tears. If you've been in and out of love, you know what I'm saying.ve, you know what I'm saying.
0393075966|5.0|I admit that economics confuses me, so when I read a book written in lucid easy to understand language I can begin to understand a compound-complex idea a little more clearly. Nothing in economics is as it seems because politics can often obfuscate with ideological explanations that are neither simple or even partially true when based on politics. Stiglitz doesn't say that the free market can't work, but that it isn't the entire answer. Regulations, as the banking meltdown of 2009 demonstrates, are necessary to prevent greed from becoming the dominating motivation for Wall Street and big banks, especially investment banks that measure success only in terms of how big their next bonus will be.    \\"Freefall\\" doesn't give us all the answers, and again I admit that I still have questions, but for a basic understanding of the markets as they played out in the past couple of years and how deregulation merely increased the problems for most of Main sreet this is a very good place to start. Some critics have already panned this book as a call to socialism, but those critics obviously lack even a basic understanding of what socialism really is and are only looking for a buzz word to sustain the belief that a totally \\"Free Market\\" system is the only good thing, when in fact it increases the chances of boom and bust cycles coming even closer together in the future. To begin, modest regulations are all that might be needed, and if bankers once again act trustworthy and preform ethically it could be enough. If greed continues unabated, then the middle class will disappear and only the wealthiest will profit.

0316044695|5.0|I first learned of this story after hearing Marcus talk as the guest speaker at a corporate event. Having been a veteran but having not gone through anything near his ordeal I could at least put it in context. This story is both awe inspiring in the picture it gives us into the Navy Seals training and the picture it gives us of the great men serving this country. I must say I also have grown to respect some of the Afghans based on this tale.     If you are a liberal you will hate this book so don't even bother. If you want to read a great story about love, faith and heart than this is for you.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I am 34 years old and all my life I have been an avid TV watcher.A lot of shows over that time I have liked, but nothing has impacted my life like Smallville.Between the chemistry of the characters, the interesting plots and the overall heart of the show, I have been hooked since the show began.I highly recommend that you buy all the seasons and watch as Tom Welling becomes the legendary Hero, that we all know and Love.

B001KVZ6FW|3.0|Up until now I've loved every Pixar movie I've ever seen, but this one was somewhat of a disappointment to me.  I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it either.    It had a few funny moments, but overall, I found it rather sad and depressing.  It was marketed as an uproarious comedy, but somehow an old man losing his wife and being forced out of his home just aren't funny subjects.  I know sometimes in entertainment, bringing the audience down makes the funny parts seem funnier, but this movie just fell a little flat for me.      A lot of the story didn't make sense.  Not that everything has to make sense, but the childhood idol of that old man should have been long-dead or at least approaching 100 years old, so the character just didn't fit.  The thing with the dogs was entertaining at times (SQUIRREL!!!) but largely didn't hit it for me either.  I've come to expect a great deal of creativity and innovation from Pixar (Monsters Inc has one of the most innovative story lines ever created) and I just didn't see the same level of that in this movie.    I would give it 3.5 stars at best.

Stevie should have slapped her for the vocals on Rhiannon, Nashville shame on you for promoting this and making people think it's worth it. The only good here thing here, is the A and R department at her label. They need a raise for pulling this off. It's just another murder on music row.
0470450266|5.0|Whether you are sculpting human or alien characters with ZBrush, your ability to create convincing results with an efficient workflow is extremely dependent on your knowledge of sculpting anatomy. As any established character artist will tell you, the education you get through sculpting your first human body following anatomically correct guidelines is one of the most important learning processes you will go through. Scott's book is an indispensible companion for you on this journey.    The book thoroughly covers the head, torso, arms and legs, all the way from the skeletal regions and muscle groups to fatty tissue and skin. It also covers how to sculpt them with top level ZBrush expertise. If that's not enough, the book's companion DVD has videos of Scott going through and showing you how to do the steps in the book, base models from you to start your human sculpture, and the results of his work that you can study.    If you are struggling with the gap between your creations and the ones you see on ZBrush Central or CG blockbuster movies, the content of this book will get you closer to making top shelf characters. It is extremely well written with excellent step by step instructions you can follow. I wish I had it during my journey of sculpting my first anatomy figure; however, I am thankful to have it now because it is extremely useful as reference when I am struggling with a certain area in my character work.    An absolute must have for any character digital sculptors library.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I have really enjoyed listening to Susan's CD.  I still get goose bumps each time she sings \\"I Dreamed A Dream.\\"  But, there are some other really good songs, \\"Wild Horses\\",  and \\"Who I Was Born to Be\\" are two of my new favorites.  I'd highly recommend...
B0026P3G12|4.0|Susan's voice sends shivers up my spine! I would have looked up more about her prior to buying the CD. Still, the inclusion bio with the CD tells a lot both positive and maybe negative. Also, I'm a romantic who loves familiar lyrics. Enjoy singing along on occasion. I'd buy her next CD. Very happy with Amazon.com treatment of my purchase.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I just saw \\"Avatar\\" with three other veteran science fiction fans--two middle aged couples.<br /><br />Bottom line: James Cameron hasn't become a writer since doing \\"Titanic.\\" That leads to the film's main shortcomings.<br /><br />But it doesn't matter. This is such a breakthrough in film--in nearly erasing the boundary between live action and animation--that anyone who cares even a little about film must see it, and see it in a movie theater, and in 3D. I don't care if you mainly like sombre low-budget Sundance films or Swedish movies so depressing you want to step in front of a train afterwards. I don't care if you find most Hollywood films jejune, or whatever other artful adjectives you prefer. You still have to see this. You can't talk about cinema unless you do. Besides, it's an eyepopping, unforgettable experience.<br /><br />Someone had described it as a film you have to have seen in order to be able to talk with anyone under 40. I suppose that's so, unless you have the sort of prosaic mind that can only relate to movies about people who look and act like you in places much like what we see around us.<br /><br />I'm not sure it's a great movie. But it is great fun, as long as you don't think too much. And a bit moving, as long as you don't feel too much. And it redefines what you can put on a screen (if you've got his $300M budget)!<br /><br />To me the most important aspect is facial animation. One of our group was underwhelmed by it--by how they'd been able to instrument the live actors' faces and transmit their expressions to the animated characters you see onscreen. Our friend had heard such glowing reports of it that perhaps he expected too much. He said he'd seen better facial expression animation in other films. But the rest of us thought it worked well and looked great. Perhaps it's that none of the actors were showing a lot of nuance--whether that's the acting, or the direction, or the limits of facial expression animation today, I don't know. But the animated characters definitely looked like the live actors.<br /><br />In some ways it's like a cross between a traditional fantasy movie and a traditional science fiction movie, with a hint of sci-fi explanations for the sorts of things that are normally explained magically.<br /><br />The forest scenes on the alien planet reminded me of the forest scenes in Hayao Miyazaki's great (non-computer) animated film \\"Princess Mononoke.\\" If you haven't seen this film, I'd strongly recommend seeing it after you see Avatar.<br /><br />The military scenes reminded me--less so--of \\"Starship Troopers.\\" That, too, would be interesting to see after \\"Avatar.\\"<br /><br />I'm an educated layman when it comes to military technology, biology, exobiology, cinema, and Cameron's films--I've seen \\"Abyss,\\" \\"Aliens,\\" \\"T1,\\" \\"T2\\" & \\"Titanic.\\" And enjoyed them all. I know what to expect from Cameron. Unfortunately, I know enough about those subjects to know when Cameron was going for an onscreen effect and defying logic and what we know about those subjects. I'm also a veteran scuba diver, and I saw where he borrowed from underwater scenes I'm familiar with. Only sometimes the transplant needed anti-rejection drugs so I'd stop thinking about how he was borrowing cool images without thinking through what kind of sense they might be making. Still, Cameron's better than George Lucas and many others in terms of borrowing images more than real ideas.<br /><br />Yeah, I know I'm a voice in the wilderness on this subject.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is the same one I have about most Hollywood sci-fi--more fi than sci, and not always understanding that a whisper can sometimes be more powerful than a shout. Cameron puts all the money onscreen.<br /><br />And speaking of screens--we saw it in a big Imax theater, on the far side, about halfway back. This was because we got there half an hour before showtime. Mistake. It wasn't awful to see it to the side like that, but it was definitely suboptimal.You'd see this best in an Imax theater from the back row as near to the center as you can get. Everyone in the audience who wasn't near that spot got less for their money.<br /><br />The 3D was very, very good. This was, as I recall, \\"RealD\\" or some such. It used inexpensive 3D glasses with what looked like mylar lenses. I had some annoying reflections from the bottoms of the big lenses, though they didn't directly interfere with the screen image.<br /><br />Later I want to see it once more in 3D on a non-Imax screen. Again, not necessarily because it's better than lots of other films with more intelligent screenplays, more nuanced acting, etc.; but because I want to see this cutting edge cinematic technology at work on a wide screen in 3D--and with me sitting in the exact middle and pretty far back.<br /><br />So did the animation look real, or did it still look like animation--especially in the scenese that combined animation with live action?<br /><br />Close. Not quite. Not yet. But we're getting close.<br /><br />You can read dozens of reviews of Avatar that tell a lot more about the story and whatnot than I did here. Avoid em until you've seen it. You'll enjoy this film more if its surprises actually surprise you.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I just saw \\"Avatar\\" for the second time, under very different circumstances--nearly empty theater, on a conventional big screen instead of IMAX, using the Real3D system and glasses.<br />The theater being nearly empty, we got to sit it the right place this time. Huge difference being able to sit smack in the middle of the theater.<br /><br />But also--I think I liked it better on a conventional wide screen than on IMAX. I can't say this for sure, since our seating was so crappy for the IMAX showing. We've seen other IMAX films, and always found that we only enjoyed the viewing if we were sitting in the back row in the middle, or nearby. This is a hard one to universalize, though. You may prefer the IMAX version. I will say they make for a distinctly different viewing experience, so you shouldn't just flip a coin. You'll probably prefer one over the other. Think it through.<br /><br />As for Avatar itself--my spouse and I enjoyed it the second time around. The visuals are so spectacular, from the very first shot to the last, and so real-seeming, that they quite overcome the formulaic plot. As my Russian friend said, you could always tell what was coming.,<br /><br />I told her that this isn't always bad, though. Some films are more like rituals, where unpredictability isn't what people are looking for. This is one of those films.<br /><br />So don't let smartypants friends dissuade you from seeing it because they have objections to the screenplay. They're probably right, but if they weren't noticing what they were seeing in order to criticize the uncreative narrative--then they've got a real problem.<br /><br />Some people regard works of art for what's missing. Someone wants said music lovers listen to music, while audiophiles listen to problems in microphone placement.<br /><br />\\"Avatar\\" has strengths and weaknesses. Most of the complaints about its weaknesses are probably true, but the strengths are so off-the-hook strong that they make it not just worthwhile but necessary to see the film, and see it in a theater, in 3D.<br /><br />Speaking of which we saw it this time with the Real3D glasses. I wear eyeglasses, and these fit over them comfortably. I was happy with the 3D experience they provided.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />What follows are some further comments that you should probably wait to read until you've seen the film, though it doesn't have plot spoilers.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Here are the storytelling risks Avatar could have taken:<br /><br />None.<br /><br />Unless Bill Gates whips out his checkbook, a $300M film must be a blockbuster to make a profit for all involved.<br /><br />That's impossible for a film that just shows domestically. It has to be a world blockbuster. It has to be PG-13 for all those conservative countries, and it has to have an easy to follow good guys/bad guys plot for all those lower middle class moviegoers in Lahore and Belo Horizonte and, and, and.<br /><br />Of course Princess Mononoke was vastly deeper. It could make a profit on domestic Japanese sales alone. Ditto various Japanese anime series.<br /><br />Ditto, for example, the scariest, most morally complex vampire film ever, the Swedish shocker \\"Let the right one in.\\" Which had virtually no special effects and no name stars...and which, I'm sure, could make a profit from domestic Swedish sales alone.<br /><br />And ditto another film you could compare Avatar with, the Finnish/Russian collaboration \\"Cuckoo.\\"<br /><br />OTOH making the Na'vi look/act so much like us might have shown a lack of imagination or simply needing to make the film fly in the world market, but it made sense biologically. Actually I objected (on scientific grounds) to the Na'vi being as different from us as they were: erect bipedal hominids aren't going to have tails. Nor blue skin. And the huge yellow eyes--you'd see that in a nocturnal animal, while the Na'vi were diurnal. The hairy USB port thing was magic with a sci-fi gloss.<br /><br />I say this because sci-fi fans generally suffer from what I call the \\"Star Wars Cantina Syndrome.\\" They assume aliens will look/act alien unless proven otherwise, as in Arthur C. Clarke's Rendezvous with Rama, where everything to do with the aliens was at all times inexplicable.<br /><br />But science has a great rule of thumb principle called the Assumption of Mediocrity: we assume what we see and know is par for the course unless proven otherwise.<br /><br />Moreover, you can see the convergent evolutionary forces throughout nature--and I've seen nature at its wildest, most diverse and fanciful, because I'm a veteran scuba diver who has dived from Indonesia to Canada to the Caribbean. It all seems like a hurricane of life forms at first, but later you discover there's a reason for everything.<br /><br />And erect bipedal hominid is the ticket for a dominant tool using terrestrial lifeform.<br /><br />The hexapedal animals, pollen sucking horse equivalents and other stuff was a lot less likely. Didn't interfere with repaying that $300M investment, but it lessened my own buy-in. One of most powerful evolutionary forces we've seen is the one forcing down the leg count on terrestrial animals above the scale of one with an exoskeleton.<br /><br />If you want to see a fairly recent sci-fi film with an actually interesting plot/characterizations/moral complexity, see \\"Serenity.\\"<br /><br />There's no use to watching Avatar and thinking about how it should have been adapted to the viewing desires of an educated minority. As others have said, just wait for the technology Cameron pioneered to become available at a lower cost.<br /><br />Then it will get very exciting. But for now and forever, the most cutting edge huge-budget films will always be lowest common denominator crowd pleasers.<br /><br />Except, of course, for \\"2001.\\" I'm still amazed Kubrick was able to get that financed.just flip a coin.

Unless Bill Gates whips out his checkbook, a $300M film must be a blockbuster to make a profit for all involved.    That's impossible for a film that just shows domestically. It has to be a world blockbuster. It has to be PG-13 for all those conservative countries, and it has to have an easy to follow good guys/bad guys plot for all those lower middle class moviegoers in Lahore and Belo Horizonte and, and, and.    Of course Princess Mononoke was vastly deeper. It could make a profit on domestic Japanese sales alone. Ditto various Japanese anime series.    Ditto, for example, the scariest, most morally complex vampire film ever, the Swedish shocker \\"Let the right one in.\\" Which had virtually no special effects and no name stars...and which, I'm sure, could make a profit from domestic Swedish sales alone.    And ditto another film you could compare Avatar with, the Finnish/Russian collaboration \\"Cuckoo.\\"    OTOH making the Na'vi look/act so much like us might have shown a lack of imagination or simply needing to make the film fly in the world market, but it made sense biologically. Actually I objected (on scientific grounds) to the Na'vi being as different from us as they were: erect bipedal hominids aren't going to have tails. Nor blue skin. And the huge yellow eyes--you'd see that in a nocturnal animal, while the Na'vi were diurnal. The hairy USB port thing was magic with a sci-fi gloss.    I say this because sci-fi fans generally suffer from what I call the \\"Star Wars Cantina Syndrome.\\" They assume aliens will look/act alien unless proven otherwise, as in Arthur C. Clarke's Rendezvous with Rama, where everything to do with the aliens was at all times inexplicable.    But science has a great rule of thumb principle called the Assumption of Mediocrity: we assume what we see and know is par for the course unless proven otherwise.    Moreover, you can see the convergent evolutionary forces throughout nature--and I've seen nature at its wildest, most diverse and fanciful, because I'm a veteran scuba diver who has dived from Indonesia to Canada to the Caribbean. It all seems like a hurricane of life forms at first, but later you discover there's a reason for everything.And erect bipedal hominid is the ticket for a dominant tool using terrestrial lifeform.    The hexapedal animals, pollen sucking horse equivalents and other stuff was a lot less likely. Didn't interfere with repaying that $300M investment, but it lessened my own buy-in. One of most powerful evolutionary forces we've seen is the one forcing down the leg count on terrestrial animals above the scale of one with an exoskeleton.    If you want to see a fairly recent sci-fi film with an actually interesting plot/characterizations/moral complexity, see \\"Serenity.\\"    There's no use to watching Avatar and thinking about how it should have been adapted to the viewing desires of an educated minority. As others have said, just wait for the technology Cameron pioneered to become available at a lower cost.    Then it will get very exciting. But for now and forever, the most cutting edge huge-budget films will always be lowest common denominator crowd pleasers.    Except, of course, for \\"2001.\\" I'm still amazed Kubrick was able to get that financed.
3941579282|5.0|When I opened the package I was surprised how nice the book looks like. I have seen a couple version, but this one is really the nicest one. So if you are looking to impress somebody this is your book. :) Well, besides that it is nicely done. I think I don't need to say much about the content sine we all know the story of this classic masterpiece. Five stars from me!
1416955070|2.0|The true testament of a good book to me is how quickly I end up reading it. This I had no problem putting down again and again. Based on other reviews and the glowing endorsement of The Twilight guru Stephenie Meyer, I expected at the very least a supernatural teenage angst fest of unrequited love. Instead, you get-*Spoiler Alert*a case of Star Wars inspired almost incest that is practically laugh out loud funny. At least it explained why the protagonists crush was the most emotionless potrayal of adolescent longing since Little House on the Prairie. The book should've been better. Some of the dialogue crackled with wit, but I found myself not really caring for any of the characters, and that could be largely due to the fact that none are that interesting or well drawn. To me it's like she had the bones of a good story, but didn't know how to flesh it out.If you're looking for your Twilight replacement, I wouldnt recommend this, unless you're absolutely desperate.
B002Q9MZHE|3.0|OK, my earlier condemnation was a bit premature. Being such a fan of Netrebo & Villazon I was compelled to revisit this Blue Ray film and was rewarded with some moving artistry so am revising this review.<br /><br />As posted earlier I nearly gave up on this film. The opening scenes were dull and lacked Blu Ray quality although later scenes were fine and up to expected HD standards.  But the Dolby 5.1 audio was particulaly diasappointing and appears to not be the new HD format. The Stereo option is very flat and lifeless.<br /><br />The costuming and sets are traditional but overall the film lacks the atmosphere of a live production although Netrebco and Villazon come across convincingly. I see some are put off by the miming but that did not bother me as the subtitles distracted close attention to it. The other artists and chorus are fine although there is no full cast listing and the conductor and orchestra remain a mystery.<br /><br />But there are quite a few negatives: the 2.35:1 film format; the questionable sound quality already referred to (although to be honest my ears adjusted so it was not as big a drawback as on first encounter); odd distracting B&W sequences; the dull lighting of Act 1.<br /><br />However the artistry is first rate so this disc is a bit of a curates egg with good and bad features. Note it is region coded, in my case A but that has nothing to do with the video quality as other region A discs here are fine.<br /><br />So I'll withdraw my earlier condemnation but only recommend it with caution.
B00005QGAX|5.0|I bought this (and Dangerous) for replacements for the original cassettes that I bought when they were originally released.  I love every song from \\"Bad\\" to hard rocking \\"Dirty Diana\\" to the beautiful \\"Man in the Mirror\\".   I also love the bonus track, \\"Streetwalker\\".  Makes me want to dance!!
0446567337|5.0|The story behind this book was terrific.  I can relate to it because my husband was in the service during Viet Nam.    The story tells you how it is when you are involved with a military person during time of war.  It was a terrific read and also a tear jerker.
B00005QGAV|5.0|I LOVE this CD (bought it as a replacement for the cassette I bought on it's very first day of release).  Like all Michael Jackson albums, I love every song.  There are never any \\"fillers\\".   But my favorites are \\"Jam\\", \\"In the Closet\\",  \\"Remember the Time\\",  \\"Give in to Me\\",  \\"Keep the Faith\\"....  Oh, forget it, I might as well list all of them!  He will always be remembered for his beautiful heart-felt \\"Heal the World\\".
0446693804|5.0|This is another incredible story from Nicholas Sparks.  It is just a simple \\"downhome\\" story about 2 people and the love that they have for each other.  This is also a \\"tear jerker\\".
B0012GMYUU|5.0|This is a great album.  Beck covers a lot of ground on this album.  The only thing I don't like about this album is that it's not long enough.  Beck really is the best Strat player alive today.
B0028K3192|3.0|It's a bit uneven, but has a couple of real gems in \\"Pretty Wings\\", and \\"Bad Habits\\", both of which are the most touching (and jazziest) R&B I've heard in a while - especially live.
B00164KYV4|3.0|Just ok for me. It was somewhat entertaining but I am glad I didn't pay big bucks to see it in the theater.
B00005TPKD|5.0|This 1969 debut by German \\"Krautrock\\" outfit Amon Duul II is a fine example of late 1960s psychedelic rock as it developed in continental Europe.  Although there is a lot in the way of 1968-1969 Pink Floyd influences, this is definitely a unique sounding album.  In fact, I love pulling these old albums out - it reminds me of why I got into progressive/psychedelic rock in the first place.<br /><br />The five tracks range in length from 2:03 to the mammoth title track (20:47).  The music blends acid rock/garage rock, melodic psychedelic rock, a high level of studio experimentation, and some European avant-garde influences together.  Throw in the occasional sitar and tabla part and you have a good idea of what Phallus Dei sounds like.  Overall, I am reminded somewhat of Pink Floyd albums such as A Saucerful of Secrets (1968) and Ummagumma (1969); particularly the live set.<br /><br />In spite of the release date and the use of the sitar/tablas here and there, this album does not sound dated at all - it still sounds really cool in an \\"arty\\" sort of way.  What contributes to the \\"artiness\\" are the unusual vocal styles of Renate Knaup and Chris Karrer, which include fairly \\"straight\\" vocals (in German) but also some chants, and moans amongst other atypical uses of the human voice.  There is also instrumentation unusual for a rock group including the occasional use of violins, vibraphone, and pieces of percussion such as Turkish drums.  Furthermore, although some of the tracks include some pretty wild jamming, the music is fairly sophisticated (for psychedelic rock) and there is evidence that the longer pieces were thought out in advance - there is some structure.  The large title track is a good example.  Indeed, these qualities set the album (and group) apart from their contemporaries (Jefferson Airplane for example).<br /><br />This remastered version by Repertoire is very nice and features restored cover artwork and a very informative booklet.  The sound quality is pretty good.  The bonus tracks include the previously unreleased four part mini-epic \\"Freak Out Requiem\\" (about 16-17 minutes long) and \\"Cymbals in the end (0:31).<br /><br />All in all this is a fine example of the \\"Krautrock\\" style by an influential group.  Recommended along with Tanz der Lemminge (1971) and Wolf City (1972).tty good.  The bonus tracks include the previously unreleased four part mini-epic \\"Freak Out Requiem\\" (about 16-17 minutes long) and \\"Cymbals in the end (0:31).<br /><br />All in all this is a fine example of the \\"Krautrock\\" style by an influential group.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|One of my all time favorites. I have watched it many times and never tire of the story.
1423119509|3.0|The nice looking chest was crushed and the books corners too.<br />It looks like the box they used to ship it was too small and they smashed the books-chest inside to make it fit.<br />The shipping box was fine so it does not look like it was damaged by the carrier.
0452289963|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. Take your time with it. It is well worth it and I can't wait to read it again. Nearly have to dip it in highlighter as it is so enlightening and noteworthy. If you can't get into it, you are not ready for the changes you need to make to yourself. Try again later.
B001B1R1EU|5.0|I'm not a music expert, far from it. And I also have to admit that what tempt me in the first place was Haydn's concerto, a piece I really like but never had in my collection. This recording far exceededmy expectations when I was ordering it. The whole collection is very interesting and suitable for multiple hearings. I find Bremen German Chamber Philharmonic's playing very well balanced with Ms Balsom's trumpet which seems to be from a different material, than ordinary brass! Coupled with her skillful playing, the sound is extremely clear and although the trumpet is probably not the easiest instrument to accompany one's day, it's a sheer pleasure to listen to, while at home or in the car. I highly recommend it.
B0029LHW68|5.0|I've read the negative and postive reviews and can only lend my voice to the fans of this CD. I have read how all of the songs sound similar and myself equate this to the score of some of my favorite movies. The symphony moving you from story to story, moment to moment till you finally get to the end of the adventure, the resolution. 30 Seconds to Mars calls forth thier army who lend thier soul and spirit to this deep involving album. The cd takes you on a journey lift your spirits in the sadness. Positives and negatives, this cd has an epic quality to it. Sad and soulful in songs like Alibi and Hurricane, are thrown in like the painful times in your life where the more powerful fist pumping songs like the title track and Kings and Queens pound forth like anthems of hope in these times of pain, cynicism and despair. The Kanye West collaboration appears here without a lot of Kanye's input, possibly none which is a good thing, which is good because the Kanye west version sucks. 30 Seconds to Mars has found a way to show the trials of existense and the angst of a generation and show that anger is not the only way to handle it, use your mind, your soul and gather your army. This is WAR!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Great movie series. Touching love story, great historicaly correct saga. Fantastic acting. Good period costuming. Great casting. All around A1 for those who care for nations history.
0446567337|5.0|i would read this book 100 times over. the story is SOOOO beautiful. Although it doesn't end how we'd want it to, it really shows that not everything has a happy ending. I really believe that it potrays what pure love between two people really is. I loved it!
B000A2RRF4|5.0|i so much enjoyed the Live in Bucharest Concert featuring Michael Jackson, I sent a copy to my Granddaughter so that she could take pleasure in it also. I plan to order several more copies for gifts to family and friends.
0439023491|5.0|An excellent sequel to the first book. While it did not have the same amount of suspense, I still found myself caught up in the story. I look forward to the next in the series coming out this summer.
B0026P3G12|5.0|We thoroughly enjoyed this CD though we bought it just to be part of Susan Boyle's success.
B002NWRMVS|3.0|There are many good songs on this CD.    There are many good arrangements on this CD.    Sadly, too often the arrangements do not fit the songs.    Growing artists, like growing children, sometimes develop unevenly, needing a little time before everything fits as it should.  I remain a fan of Norah Jones and look forward to her next project.
0743277457|5.0|I really enjoyed this book by Josh.  It takes the reader step by step towards mastery of one's chosen field, be it art.  It is well written, as well.  I think the best part for me is on how to use adversity to your advantage.  He is into fight and not flight, usually, but it is fight with insight and not blind rage.  There are the 4 Fs of life:  fight or flight, feed and .....O foolery, have focus, and be my friend.  Lucky, John Cutler Anderson, still on the road, make it a blue road.  OK - read Josh's book!
0938045695|5.0|You need to read carefully, if you are unfamiliar with this type of workout, as I was. However, the book explains everything very well, and if you take you time and follow everything exactly, it should work as advertised.    With just a very basic work out level so far, my posture has improved, my back feels better, and I have more energy. Also, my wife is seeing muscles that haven't been seen in quite a while!    This is a program a busy person, such as myself, who also has a hard time sticking with a workout plan in general, can do, persevere in, and see results from.    I can't say enough good things about \\"Enter the Kettlebell\\" and kettlebells in general!
B001UV4XX8|1.0|Are they sure about this 1.77/1 aspect ratio? This is absurd. What are we living in the 80s? Warner Brothers are idiots.
B00284BNKC|5.0|This is  great movie. I bought it on Blue ray and wasnt disapointed at all. Still is a great movie but now it is in hi def.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Clint Eastwood does a great job in his role as a widowed Vietnam War veteran whose neighborhood is becoming predominantly Asian. Great film, some funny parts, the plot is complete but eventually depressing, and the ending is great. Lots of racial terms and swearing, but this is a Vietnam vet we're talking about.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I read this on vacation in no time.  My first by this author.  Mystery, not sure how or where it was going.  Love that!
B002RVZV9K|4.0|Some of my initial reactions to the movie are similar to what others have noted (unusual pacing, unusual selection of guitarists, unusual presentation of the \\"summit\\", etc.), but after listening to the commentary track and looking at the extras, my appreciation of the movie increased.    Yes, the structure and pacing was a deliberate choice (remarkable how much \\"This is Spinal Tap\\" has influenced both rock musicians, and rock documentary makers). Yes there was a bigger list of guitarists that the movie producers had considered. And Yes, there was a lot of music at the summit that never made it to theatrical release.    It might get Loud may not be the definitive rock documentary, but it is a good film about the relationship between the electric guitar and the artists who play it.  A film that deliberately stays away from the \\"rock critic\\" and \\"rock historian\\" view of the subject.
0743277465|5.0|First of all, I am not a viral marketer, which is what I assume all 5 star reviews are.     If you are one of those people who reads biographies of exceptional individuals trying to extract wisdom to apply to your own life and circumstances then I highly recommend this book to you. It is loaded with concepts that you can take and start personalizing to meet your own ends. If you are a seasoned self-help/lifestyle veteran like myself then I would still recommend this book for the gems like circle making.    If you want concrete, step by step paths that require small amounts of introspection, then look elsewhere. If you want an amusing story with boatloads of applicability via intense, and most importantly, honest introspection then pick this up immediately.    It is in my top 5 of all of my self-help/lifestyle purchases, perhaps top 3.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I'm delighted to comment on Susan Boyle's first CD. There is a good balance of religious, stage and popular music. She does a fine job of holding her own among other current recording artists. I've enjoyed playing I Dreamed A Dream--over and over. I wish her every success.
0312383436|5.0|Although the entire pretext of this story, Milly's impulsive marriage, is rather silly, somehow the whole story ends up working beautifully.  Whether writing in her pen or real name, Wickham has an amazing ability to create characters who you care about despite the fact that they are often foolish, immature, dizzy, flighty et al.  Milly is pretty much all of those, but she ends up being likeable because of the writing.<br /><br />The Isobel and Harry sub-plot was far more preposterous, and could have been omitted without any harm to the storyline.<br /><br />But all in all, I really loved this story!
B000UZPIAW|2.0|same thing over and over. poor nikki. had it all and his parents screwed him and made him do drugs. wish i hadnt have given him more money for when he relapses again.
0061766089|1.0|The problem with good design is that as a finished product, it tends to efface the process that led to it.  Master painters and sculptors often made dozens of studies before creating the celebrated works we see in museums --- and we need to follow a similar process before we can expect to produce anything good or beautiful.<br /><br />I dislike this book.  The title promises so much, and then the author tries to stuff in as many vignettes as possible, giving short shrift to each, as well as to the overall message.  Since every story employing [the author's firm] IDEO or a \\"design team\\" was a smashing success, the argument goes, the author's processes must be the right way to stimulate design thinking.  What about the flip side of the story?  Why isn't there an analysis of design failures?<br /><br />Fortunately, the author summarizes the main process points in the final 15 pages of the book in CEO-talk: \\"begin at the beginning\\", \\"take a human-centered approach\\", \\"fail early, fail often\\", \\"get professional help\\", \\"share the inspiration\\", \\"blend big and small projects\\", \\"budget to the pace of innovation\\", \\"find talent any way you can\\", \\"design for the cycle\\", \\"don't ask what? ask why?\\", \\"open your eyes\\", \\"make it visual\\", \\"build on the ideas of others\\", \\"demand options\\", \\"balance your portfolio\\", \\"design a life\\".<br /><br />While reading this book, I found that \\"design team\\" could often be replaced by \\"consultant\\".  The author does not describe what separates mediocre design from great design; nor how to identify a good design team.<br /><br />The author describes his \\"butterfly test\\", where people vote for ideas by affixing post-it notes next to items posted on the wall.  This is essentially a public ballot --- a cute idea, which will only work in organizations where people won't be swayed by how others have voted; otherwise, wisdom-of-crowds benefits won't accrue.
B0027BOL4G|4.0|Great documentary, if this film does not open your eyes to what is in our food nothing will.
B002EEP3NO|3.0|This was a difficult project.  The pieces come all in many, many different bags, but there is no apparent order to the bags.  For example, all the 4 by 2 blocks do not  come together in a bag.  It is a puzzle and multiple different pieces come in different bags.  This took many hours to sort out in order to even start building.  I think this was an unnecessary step.  Other lego toys have different stages of the building process in differnt bags in order.  it really is difficult enough for the children to do, let alone having to sort thousands of pieces first.  this was unnecessary.  in addition, in the end, there were at least 6 important pieces missing, with many extra pieces that were not used.  this made little sense to me.  luckily we have an extensive lego collection and were able to come up with substitutes, but for over $400, i believe that we should have received ALL the pieces.  The actual toy looks marvelous and is very fun to play with.  That said, i am still upset about the missing pieces and do not see why they had to be jumbled in the bags.
1591843162|5.0|Godin's book has arrived at the perfect time.  He puts into words what anyone who has been paying attention to the career landscape must have been thinking but wasn't articulate enough to say. As I read it, I sort of hit myself in the head and thought, \\"yes!\\"  Like a Malcolm Gladwell book, he makes his points through the use of interesting stories and anecdotes.  What gives this book extra cred for me is that Seth Godin is a marketing genius.  He has framed this argument through the eyes of a pragmatic and forward-thinking marketer and helps you think of your own career in that same way. I certainly have a new view and new hope about my work.    If someone you care about is in a funk about their work and wondering how to get out of it, give them this book.  It will intelligently shatter their viewpoint toward work and help them make sense of things.  And that's their best hope for doing work they enjoy.  Maybe we all should just take a few boxes of Linchpin to hand out at our next high school reunion. Bravo!
B00000IQC8|3.0|Bought the movie so that I could study the fundamentals of script writing, at least, that's the excuse I used and I'm sticking to it. It wasn't a bad movie being that it was the director's first attempt at it. I actually enjoyed seeing it in black and white film. It kind of reminded me of the movies I saw when I was a kids in the 1960's. Okay, it was funny to watch. I'd recommend getting it and the squeal. In a way I wished it to was in black and white but I guess when Hollywood throws money your way to make it better, you use it. Anyway, it was fun to watch. So go ahead and get it and invite your buddies over for a laugh.
B000641D2Y|5.0|I purchased this movie for a gift and from what I understand the person that received it was very happy .
0060005696|4.0|If you are looking to get into the issues and pitfalls of decision making, this is a very good and fun book to test the waters. While it has way too many redundant examples of decisions we are all constantly faced with, it does a great job of identifying each of the components of most of the decisions we make. It is a quick read and very interesting. Perfect fodder for a cocktail party and you will learn something new. I am just not sure it really had to be quite as long as it was. It could have accomplished the same thing in 75% of the pages or included more discussion of the scientific research on the topic.
032147404X|5.0|I purchased this book because I recently got a Canon DSLR also from Amazon.  I am a total beginner when it comes to using a SLR. So I got this one because of the gret reviews.  This book is very good.  Easy to read and very informative.  I've also bought a couple of others, but like this one the best.  I am planning on also getting the volumes 2 and 3 in the near future.
B002T9H2LA|4.0|Typical Tarantino. Good characters, quirky storyline. I need to watch it again. I like war movies, and I like Brad Pitt. Overall, well done, entertaining and recommended.
B002LCOQU0|4.0|Of the three Kraftwerk albums I own, this is my least favorite, though it is not a bad album. There are plenty of their trademark repetitious machine music phrases with plenty of melody and odd sounds thrown in.<br /><br />I recognize more of this album than any of their others because I've heard clips in commercials, radio theme songs, and other places that I can't quite pin down. I think this album may have been their biggest hit, chart wise.<br /><br />It has plenty of good cuts, however, I don't find I get as absorbed in them as I have with Autobahn and Trans-Europe Express. I am only contrasting The Man Machine against the others as it is still a great album.<br /><br />If you like good electronic music, you can't go wrong with The Man Machine. Recommended.
0743455967|5.0|King takes his readers through his life, peppering amongst the biographical detail his insights into his writing craft. I bought this book a few years ago for a university writing course for my step-daughter. She recommended I read it, so I purchased my own copy. I'm glad I did because it's a book that ought to be read by aspiring writers with a pen in hand for marginal notes or asterisks.A most novel (pardon the pun) approach to writing about writing indeed. The book is part biography, part tips for the aspiring writer, woven into a truly entertaining read. Highly recommended!
B00004WNSN|5.0|Even since I got into electronic music back in the 60's (Lothar and the Hand People), I've sought out bands that play in that genre. Kraftwerk were one of the pioneers of the German branch of the genre, along with Tangerine Dream.<br /><br />Trans-Europe Express is a deep listening album, full of unique sounds that take many listens to fully appreciate. The band has a tendency to play repetitious riffs, and occasionally, they go on and on with nothing new each 12 bars, and they have been criticized for that. However, they also lay down a machine-like atmosphere layered with melodies, electronic drum beats, and Ralf Hutter's mechanical voice.<br /><br />As the music plays, I can focus in on the subject of each song, and actually feel it. This is not just endless noodling, set over a repetitious beat. It evolves.<br /><br />As I listen I am also trying to figure out how they get some of those sounds. I know how to replicate many of them, but they also surprise me with something that takes a while to figure out. I actually have to force myself to stop thinking analog synth patches as I listen to it.<br /><br />Overall, this album is pure atmosphere with some melodies and unique accented vocals to hold it all together. I place it right up there with Autobahn. Highly recommended for electronic music fans.
B00177YEFM|3.0|I am a high school band director and I wanted it to use as a baton for our spring concert. My groups are performimg music from the Stars Wars movies and I thought it would be fun to conduct with. For that, it works great, as a reading or desk light, it is not very bright.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|It's hours of fun in a cute box.  lol.  There were some seasons that weren't so great, but the overall price on amazon was lower than anywhere else i found it.  :)  AND, it has a very cool \\"Gilmore-isms\\" book that explains all the random pop references they make in the show in alphabetical order.  I haven't had the chance to really check it out closely, but it's pretty great.  Only advice - watch an episode or two of the show before you decide to buy it if you've never watched before... most of the seasons are the same kind of banter and if you didn't like it, you'd be dissatisfied with your purchase, whereas,  if you did like it, you'd even enjoy the \\"not so awesome\\" episodes.  I feel like it's worth it... enjoy!
B002T9H2LA|4.0|I liked it very much. I enjoy any time I read or see that an enemy of the US gets dusted on a regular basis.
0061914177|5.0|Gary does a great job explaining the power of social media networking. He also outlines the best ways to start blogging right now. Great book! Great Info! I am currently working on building a site right now and i am using the majority of the techniques I read about in this book.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|As always Michael Blube'is awesome.. He always gives us exactly what we expect from him.  Amazing voice, style and great looks.  Perfect package.
0810993139|5.0|This is a laugh out loud book.  My four boys took turns reading to each other and laughing.  Have a reluctant reader?  Try this book!
B002MU4NL8|5.0|This has to be one of the most entertainingly sarcastic movies of the decade, basically riding on the Star Trek premise, and leaving no stone unturned. Great humor, great acting, and the plot is actually intelligent and entertaining; the viewer will definately walk away gratified.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|I have been a fan of Alicia Keys since I first heard the song \\"Fallin'\\".    [[ASIN:B00005JXS6 Songs in A Minor]] was Alicia's debut CD and it was released in 2001.   My favorites included \\"Troubles\\", \\"Goodbye\\", \\"Butterflyz\\", \\"Girlfriend\\" and \\"How Come U Don't Call Me\\".    Her 2nd CD, [[ASIN:B0000DD7LC The Diary of Alicia Keys]] was released in 2003.   As soon as I heard \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" and \\"If I Ain't Got You\\", I knew that Alicia had something special on her hands.    My other favorites included \\"Diary\\", \\"Karma\\" and \\"So Simple\\".   This CD was just as good as \\"Songs In A Minor\\".    4 years later Alicia released [[ASIN:B000VEYJP2 As I Am]], which was too long of a delay to some of her fans.    However, after they were treated to songs such as \\"Like You'll Never See Me Again\\", \\"I Need You\\", \\"Teenage Love Affair\\", \\"Superwoman\\" and \\"The Thing About Love\\", her fans weren't disappointed.    With \\"The Element Of Freedom\\", Alicia picks up where she left off to nice results.   Her first 2 singles \\"Doesn't Mean Anything\\" and \\"Try Sleeping With A Broken Heart\\", fall along the same lines as Alicia speaks about heartbreak and missing the one that she loves.    \\"Empire State Of Mind (Part 2) Broken Down\\" is Alicia's r&b version of \\"Empire State Of Mind\\" which feaures Alicia and Jay Z and is featured on his \\"Blueprint 3\\" CD.    Alicia does an excellent job of capturing the energy of the original version and re-writing the song to talk about her town the same way Jay Z did in his lyrics.     On \\"Wait Til You See My Smile\\", Alicia finds a way to make an anthem of inspiration just as she was able to do with \\"No One\\".   This song has the ability to take you out of the darkest times and is very inspirational.     This track is clearly my favorite from \\"The Element Of Freedom\\" and hopefully it gets released as a single.     On \\"That's How Strong My Love Is\\", Alicia gets to explain to her significant other what she is willing to do to make sure that he believes in what they haveand how much of an effect that could have on him.   Just as she explained on \\"The Thing About Love\\", love can take you through many things, good and bad.    On \\"Unthinkable (I'm Ready)\\", Alicia shows a sense of vulnerability as she explains how a man has taken her to places that she has never been and has her doing things that she rarely does.    This is another great song on this album.     \\"Put It In A Love Song\\" features Beyonce and is produced by Swizz Beatz.     While it's not a bad track, it may not be as great as what some people may have thought when they saw that Alicia and Beyonce were on the same song.   Obviously, with that combination, most people would have expected a collaboration to remember.     \\"Love Is My Disease\\"  talks about how Alicia is missing her love when there are times that she can't be with him.   She appreciates the feeling when she is with him but it's hard to deal with the times that he has to leave for any reason.  \\"Distance And Time\\" deals with relationships that may have failed because of the distance between the couple.   Alicia sounds as if she is speaking from personal experience as she pours her heart into the song.    \\"How It Feels To Fly\\" has Alicia talking about how being in love makes her feel how she wants to fly and stay in the sky and never come down.    Overall, I definitely think that fans of Alicia's previous 3 albums will also be a fan of \\"The Element Of Freedom\\".  There may be songs that are better than others in some cases, but you shouldn't have to skip too many tracks when you listen to this CD in its entirety.

B000HCO83Q|5.0|As this movie opens, things are looking up for mutants.  A new President (Josef Sommer) is so sympathetic to their concerns that he has created a Department of Mutant Affairs, helmed by one of their own--former X-Man Dr. Hank \\"Beast\\" McCoy (Kelsey Grammar).  At Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, the mansion has been repaired after the commando incursion of [[ASIN:B0000BWVCM X2 - X-Men United (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)]], and students of all sizes scurry through the halls at class-change time.  Even Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) seems to have settled in as part of the team, although in Danger Room simulations he still has a tendency to bend the rules.  But Scott Summers (James Marsden) is so consumed by grief over the death of Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) that he's abdicated his position as leader, forcing Storm (Halle Berry) to step into the slot--a job she doesn't want.  And Magneto (Ian McKellen) remains at large and a matter of deep concern to the government.  Then Jean is unexpectedly resurrected from the depths of Alkali Lake.  But Prof. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) fears what the strain of saving herself may have done to her Class 5 mutant powers.  Meanwhile, Warren Worthington II (Michael Murphy), head of a great pharmaceutical company, has announced the creation of a vaccine that can suppress--permanently--all mutant ability.  Despite assurances that taking it will be entirely voluntary, Magneto, that survivor of the Holocaust, fears what its existence may mean and begins assembling a mutant army called \\"The Brotherhood.\\"  In the end, it's five Xavier students against a mass of raging outlaw mutants with a weapon that may mean the end of the world.    This splendid climax to the X-Men trilogy is worth every cent of its cost, from the sensitive portrayals of inner conflict suffered by Wolverine, Xavier, Storm, and Jean to the thunderous John Powell score ([[ASIN:B000FBFTCS X-Men:  The Last Stand (Original Motion Picture)]]) to the introduction of imaginative new mutant characters (including Ben Foster as Worthington's son/namesake, Angel, with his gorgeous 20-foot wingspan) to the stunning special effects.  (I'm only disappointed that Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler didn't make a return appearance.)  Note: If you didn't see it in the theater, DO NOT stop the player until after the credits have rolled.  You'll see a short scene that hints of more to come--and if it's as good as this, I can't wait!

0670021652|4.0|As a man, I managed to resist the siren call of \\"Eat, Pray, Love.\\" It's not that I don't read female-oriented literature, and, in fact, \\"The Secret Life of Bees\\" and \\"The Lovely Bones\\" are some of my favorite novels, but I tend to steer clear of the latest literary bandwagons. My resistance crumbled after lunch with River Jordan--an incredible author in her own right--during which she insisted I simply had to try Gilbert's books.<br /><br />I started out with \\"Committed.\\" Married for nearly twenty years, I thought this subject of marriage might be an interesting one. Within the first few pages, I was caught up in the whimsical web of Gilbert's prose. She uses humor and honesty to disarm, and I found myself looking forward to the next chapter. I wondered how she and her beloved Felipe would overcome the obstacles of Homeland Security, not to mention their own fears of going through divorce. In today's society, it's a genuine fear. Gilbert makes it clear that she would've been content in a committed relationship, without the legal documentation, but the US government had other plans for her--and, she seems to admit, perhaps God did too.<br /><br />Despite the sparkling prose and personal insights, \\"Committed\\" lacks a bit of that anecdotal, fun-loving spirit that I suspect made EPL such a huge bestseller. Gilbert makes some great observations about marriage in other cultures, and the way relationships should/shouldn't work in our own, but these observations sometimes feel like long editorial pieces instead of threads in a running narrative. We work through long passages before encountering Liz and Felipe again, sharing a seat on a horrendous bus ride, or relaxing in the sun. More of the personal would've made this book more enjoyable for me; nevertheless, I found it readable and worth investigating. While I don't agree with all of Gilbert's commentaries, and while I was taken back by her misinterpretation of the early church fathers' view on marriage (before the Catholic Church stepped in), I thought she made some excellent points about the Auntie Brigade, the mortality rate of married women, and so on.<br /><br />I wish Liz and Felipe all the best, and I hope many are challenged by this book to rethink their own relationships, as well as our cultural views that have led to the dissolution of so many marriages.d in), I thought she made some excellent points about the Auntie Brigade, the mortality rate of married women, and so on.

B001LF2WCC|4.0|This is a fantastic movie. loved the blue ray and gerard the butt-ler the best!He is an awesome actor and it showed in the great epic tail based on a true story about King Leonidis and his warriors! His buff body was enough for me to watch it, but hey, the guys will dig it too, lots of blood and some gore to go along with the story, but that is what makes it seem so real in every way! Great special effects and editing! Awesome movie, way worth the $20 to $30 price tag! This is a keeper, even our teenage son liked it alot as well as my hubby, who thought it was really great too! I do not however, recall seeing Heath Ledger or Christian Bale in it, I do not believe so, unless they were some boys in it with very small roles! I have seen it twice! Go Buy it!
B001GCUNWQ|4.0|Good, fun, entertaining movie. The actors who have been chosen for the voices are good choices and they do a great job. In this story, the female mamoth has a baby at the end of the story.
B002RSDWF8|4.0|You get:  - the usual album + 2 bonus tracks (including the cool new (rather 80s) 'One time we lived')  - an ambient version of the album 'Wait for me' (very cool, in fact I personally prefer the ambient version of Hotel to the actual Hotel album)  AND   - a very very cool DVD - featuring recent live stuff (go! if you've not seen Moby live (you'll want to after seeing the DVD), clips from the Wait for me album, interviews, etc    All for a (currently at least) BARGAIN price!    Moby describes this album as being a more beautiful, musical, personal album than some of his previous... the album you might listen to alone on a Sunday morning (as opposed to an album you might listen to with people / at a club). It is that    Preview a few tracks - then buy it!

B001684L0A|5.0|I enjoyed this series when it first came out, so this was a obvious buy on my part. The only hesitation was that it came out on DvD first, but when the Blu-ray version came out I bought it. The production demanded that clarity in detail.     The show also showed how.. well. REtarded America had become in education in regards to our children and how well people spoke outside of monosyllabic dialogue nowadays. Seriously, Adams wife was teaching her own children LATIN at tender ages of TEN Or under! Both men an women used words in daily life back then you wouldn't hear in your own household too.     Compare that to the now I dare you.

B001992NUQ|4.0|I know he was knee capped by the main actor -weaver- and chocked by the production -20th Century-, but I still don't like what he did in the end.

0446567337|3.0|i've never read nicholas sparks before, but felt very compelled to read this book because the movie is due out soon.    so here are my problems  1. THE LANGUAGE OF THE MAIN CHARACTER: for a soldier who never really took to school, went to college, or really ever read - he's really freaking eloquent. some of the times he sounds like an old man trying to talk like a young man. example: who uses \\"coed\\" to describe female college students? i was a college student in 2000 and haven't been referred to, nor did i refer to myself as a \\"coed.\\" honestly, who says or hears a 20 year old male college student say something like \\"man, look at them hot coeds.\\" the other half of the time the character, john, speaks like a well read, college or graduate bound student. and i'm not trying to stereotype any soldier by saying the can't speak well, but it didn't seem to flow. i know a lot of soldiers because of my brother in law, and they all remind me of john - but they don't speak like this. they're intelligent, smart, they've seen things no one should - but i don't hear them speak like this at all. so it made it a little less believable.  2. PLOT SEEMS PLANNED: and i know it is, but i don't like reading a book that feel like it's been mapped out. it literally feels like \\"okay, boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, other boys like girl. ooh, lets add in some family drama to add depth to the boy. let's make the girl the all american sweetheart girl that no boy can resist falling in love with....\\" you know what i mean? sometimes in reading the book, it felt like \\"okay, milestone met, check.... next milestone met, check....\\" i want to be lost in the story, be involved in the characters and in their world.    here's what i enjoyed  1. RELATE-ABLE STORY: for the most part, the story was easily believable. lots of soldiers join for different reasons and the story was relate-able. i could easily imagine some of the soldiers i've met telling me about their background and coming across something like this  2. EVEN SOLDIERS CAN FIND LOVE: unlike most soldiers i know, the main character found love. so it was nice, especially for those soldiers that died - to imagine that maybe they too could have fallen in love.   3. NO FAIRY TALE ENDING: it was real. real life sucks sometimes and that's the truth of it. i'm really glad it wasn't all glitter and rainbows because that would have make me just hate this book. i liked that the main characters were conflicted and acted like, well, young people in love.    so as much as i enjoy the story, it seems like every time i started to get into the story... BAM... unrealistic character language. totally tore me out of whatever literary trance i could have found myself in. so that's why the 3 starts.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|I've been a big fan of Neon Genesis Evangelion for many years. I've watched all the original series (and barely made it out alive from 25-26) and absolutely love [[ASIN:B000068OJ1 The End of Evangelion]]. When I found out they were remaking the series, I was both excited and concerned, but it turns out my fears were alleviated when I finally got to see Evangelion: You Are (Not) Alone.<br /><br />Gainax took the first few episodes of the series, cleaned up the story, and redrew all the art, amazingly integrated CGI (especially compared to its poor modern usage in anime) and used a movie budget to make something that looks GOOD to watch in 1080p. If you're as big an Eva fan as I am, or even if you just liked some of the series, I'd definitely recommend Evangelion 1.11. They've changed enough of it to flow better in a straight 110 minutes of run time and I didn't want to stop watching for a second.<br /><br />Now, the real question begins: When will 2.11 escape to the United States?
0451228731|5.0|Heck YEAH! almost done with Daemon, this story is epic this will probably be the first book(s) I've read first before seeing the movie, they will probably make one I bet.

I've always been leery of getting too reliant on computers despite being an IT guy.  Now is the time to be thankful some aspects of present are still somewhat private, like some cars, and paper money! Someday this will be a thing of the past.

B002WY65VU|5.0|Spoiler alert: Details follow, but no matter what you'll still die laughing at this great horror and humor combination.<br /><br />Yes, there is such a thing as funny zombies. At least in the movie ZOMBIELAND. While George Romero may have made his fortune with the flesh eating living dead, this new take on the genre adds a much needed dose of originality and humor.<br /><br />The movie is narrated by Columbus (Jessie Eisenberg), a young man with his own set of rules for survival. Rule number one is cardio. As he puts it, the fatties were the first to go due to their inability to outrun the zombies. With each moment of the film, Columbus passes along bits of wisdom concerning how to survive. Some involve his personal experiences; others are short vignettes demonstrating how to survive.<br /><br />While traveling down the road in hopes of finding his detached family alive in Columbus, OH (the names of the characters relate to where they are from, a way of detaching yourself from those around you), Columbus meets up with Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson). The pair may not be fast friends, but it's a ride so they move on, heading east with the hope that there are more survivors there.<br /><br />As they travel you get a glimpse of the difference between the two. Columbus is sort of a nebbish, prone to sitting back and not taking things head on. Tallahassee, on the other hand, runs full throttle taking on zombies with ease and pleasure. When the pair check out a grocery store in hopes of finding the elusive Twinkies that Tallahassee craves, they meet up with two young girls, Wichita (Emma Stone) and her younger sister, Little Rock (Abigail Breslin), also survivors.<br /><br />Unfortunately the girls are also con artists who take Tallahassee's car and leave the dynamic duo to fend for themselves. Finding another car, the pair head out only to cross paths with the girls once more. The exception this time is that they band together to get somewhere figuring they have a better chance this way.<br /><br />The girls are headed towards an amusement park in Los Angeles and with little coaxing the guys join them. Landing in Hollywood, Tallahassee has an idea: find a \\"Homes of the Starts Map\\" and spend the night in one of the mansion belonging to some mega star. Who they select and what happens makes for one of the funniest parts of the movie with an exceptional cameo appearance by...well you'll see.<br /><br />While at the Hollywood home much is revealed about the characters. Tallahassee shows an emotional side unseen before and with good reason. Columbus and Wichita begin to develop young love, only to stop just short when Tallahassee interrupts.<br /><br />The next morning the girls set out for the park and the guys plan discuss where to go next. Ignoring one of his rules about not being a hero, Columbus begins to think that maybe the girls could use their help. This of course turns out to be true when the bright lights of the amusement park attract hundreds of zombies all intent on a buffet of teen girls.<br /><br />Arriving just in the nick of time, Columbus and Tallahassee come to the rescue with the girls trapped at the top of one of the rides. But with so many zombies on the scene, just how can each of the four survive?<br /><br />The movie takes the usual zombie genre route with no explanation of just how the whole thing began. Zombies are intent on eating the living. And like the newer zombie films, these zombies move at a frenetic pace rather than the lumbering flesh eaters from the old films.<br /><br />What makes it different is the humor that is added. Rather than be non-stop serious the whole time, jokes pass between the characters. The search for Twinkies has hilarious results. And the aspect of young love blooming from the ruins of the world adds a nice touch of hope for the future.<br /><br />There is already talk of a sequel and I for one can't wait. Even watching this the second time I found myself laughing aloud at the various jokes though I knew what was coming. And the horror aspects of it were as solid as any blood filled flick in theaters these days. And for gore fans, yes this is a wet film with zombie blood gushing everywhere.<br /><br />If you're looking for something a little different that adds a twist to a well used genre, then this is your cup of tea. It might not be the best things for the kids to watch, especially younger ones, but teens will undoubtedly laugh and you might have a chuckle or two as well.

B000FC2L1Y|4.0|This was the very first book I read on my brand new reader. I had the hardcover version checked out from the library but it was just so darn BIG that I kept putting off reading it. Now I am not at all opposed to thick books - longer is usually better IMHO - but thick books are heavy. They don't travel so well. They make my wrists ache. They are hard to read in bed. So, it was easy to decide to return my free library copy and pay for the ebook. What a delight it was to read Diana Gabaldon - but THIN! I also loved trying out the dictionary function. Naturally, not every Scottish word is represented - but that just made it all that much more special when I got one. I just wish the dictionary had pictures. That would be so cool.

B000W9399S|3.0|It is rare to find a book where its strength is also its weakness.  However, such is the case with The Colour of Magic.  As a satire of the fantasy genre, the book has no boundaries and succeeds and fails for it.  The author takes aim at a number of cliches and stereotypes and succeeds about 66% of the time.  However, the author seemed to want to skewer so many different cliches that the narrative connecting them suffers.  It reminds me of a movie parody a la Scary Movie.  Whether the movie/book works depends on how skillfully the disparate scenes are connected.  Here, the connections are hit and miss.<br /><br />At times, it seems like the author paints himself into a corner and just makes up some ridiculous to solve the problem.  For instance, at one part of the book, the two main characters are falling to certain death from several thousand feet in the air.  All of sudden - Whoosh - and they are on an airplane on an alternate world for a page or two and then - Whoosh - they are back in their own world miles away and several thousand feet over water.  In the next paragraph, they are washing up on an island.  It makes the reader go Wait, What, how did they survive the fall?  Absent these distracting occurrences, the novel is otherwise entertaining and original.  I can't help but think i missed some of the references and satire due to the age of the book, but the ones i caught i mostly enjoyed.  Reasonably entertaining, but i will not be continuing the series.

B002JIEYLW|4.0|I haven't listened to the Black Box 2004 remaster of Vol 4, but I am familiar with the old Castle Communications CD release that was etched in the 1980's.  This 2009 remaster has a noticable volume drop in the right channel at 4 minutes 52 seconds into \\"Wheels of Confusion\\".  I'm quite surprised this \\"glitch\\" was allowed to slip past quality controls and it leaves me wondering if the original master tapes are simply getting too old and brittle.    I've pondered the notion of ripping the track to WAV and performing a decible boost to the right channel in the damaged area to correct this problem.  If I do, I'll keep you posted on my findings and methods.

A six-year old (Ender) is chosen to go to military school because of his potential.  Ender must overcome social, physical, and mental obstacles.  And still be six-years old.  The story is compelling and the characters are deep.  The ending leaves me scratching my head but I'll let you decide that as I would still recommend this book.

This is the first book that ever made me extremely paranoid; afterwards I felt like that someone (or something) was watching me at night. That at any moment a door might appear in my home, or that I'll open a door and find something else behind it... Something horrible and hungry... Because of the effect that the book had on me I have to recommend it. Any book with that level of emotional power is a must-read in my mind. Definitely check this one out. However, if you scare easily read with caution.
0312370849|4.0|A historical fiction about an event that took place in Paris during WW II.  It tells of the rounding up Jews in Paris and their treatment by the French police and  German invaders as the Jews were prepared to be sent to concentration camps.  It was a forgotten portion of French history until an American journalist who is married to a Frenchman was assigned to write about the story for a magazine. Her quest to find a child that was removed from her family and to contact the child's family becomes an obsession which eventually involves her husband's family.  The story draws the reader into the family dynamics and educates the reader about a piece of recent history many of us have never heard of.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I bought this movie for a friend who really likes it and was happy I could find it at Amazon for a fair price because I could not find it in stores. Very happy with purchase!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Excellent. I gave this as a gift to some friends.  I have the HD-DVD version. I like Attenborough's narration. The video quality is excellent. The main reason I gave this item as a gift is because this video of the world shows the awesomeness of God's creating hand.
B002ODEJYE|5.0|This is very simply an excellent concert disk.  The show is amazing... very theatrical and entertaining.  I have never seen a Pink concert before (live or disk) but was really impressed with this one.  If you like concert DVDs, this is a great one.   Even better in Bluray!
0698400852|5.0|We all know the story of Dickens' Christmas Carol.  I chose this edition because the description indicated that it had good illustrations.  We weren't disappointed at all- the paper is nice, heavy, with a touch of cream in the color.  The illustrations are all in full color, and found on just about every page.  Finding the short story \\"The Christmas Tree\\"  at the end of the book was a nice surprise too!  Overall, an excellent addition to our Christmas library.
B002L5810I|5.0|This video is a great mixture of music, drama, fun, laughter, sadness, suspense, and of course ALL MJ!  I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it and will watch it again and again. It can easily be interpreted as a statement about MJ's constant flight from mobs of fans, papparazzi, leacherous newspeople, and evil forces wanting to bring him down, as well as his escape into fantasy and the world of children to help ease the stress of it all.  But more than anything, it's pure entertainment and LOVE, which is what MJ was (and is) all about.

B002RSDW80|5.0|What can I say!  If you love to cook and enjoy great food, you can't pass up this movie.  Julia Child was at her best at what she did and Meryl Streep knocked her betrayal out of the ballpark.  Great movie with great characters.  A real keeper.

B002436WFI|1.0|I bought this movie used for $3.00.  Unfortunately, it is not worth 3 cents.  This is absolutely one of the worst movies I have ever seen and believe me I tried and tried.  As a long-time Terry Pratchett fan I am horrified!  Jeremy Irons, Tim Curry and Sean Astin.  All actors I love.  All doing complete crap in this movie.  It was embarassing to watch.  Don't bother with this total loser, you will regret it.
B002ZHKZEM|2.0|Five \\"specials\\" (bit longer than regular episodes) across (inexplicably) five discs with commentary, Confidentials, deleted scenes (all placed on the last disc without regard to the episode they pertained to), and the like. Over-priced, yes, but as mentioned elsewhere, in the context of the longer-length series and its over-pricing, apropos in keeping with the pattern. As for the worth of the episodes themselves...fairly rubbish. Though nothing as awful as the Christmas special \\"Voyage of the Damned\\", nothing remotely as good as even the middling, say, \\"New Earth\\". So the end of Davies and Tennant's Doctor comes and goes without much recommendation. The first two specials (\\"The Next Doctor\\" and \\"Planet of the Dead\\") were the best of the lot - the first for its idea, if not execution, and the second for its potential companion (Lady Christina), though not its actual story. Next, \\"The Waters of Mars\\" arrives as filler with a \\"villain-of-the-week\\" threat. And finally, the two-part finale \\"The End of Time\\" brings the return of the Master and another original-era character played by Timothy Dalton. Again, the Master is played with no style, subtely nor sinister demeanor but all camp (even Yellowstone National isn't large enough to contain this much camp!), clown and fight or flight. Literally. For diehards and fools only; pray that you're just a diehard, at worst.

B002U6CJCE|4.0|**SPOILERS**    Well, I went by Best Buy after work and they only had 2 Blu-ray copies and I didn't look to see how many DVD copies. (Hard to tell how many copies they really had sold or had available.) Anyways, they took my coupon after investigating it like it was fraudulent or something. Total came to $22 USD and change.    I opened it and didn't expect Blu-ray disc artwork, but it had some cool artwork of the \\"coolers\\" the Unisols are in in the movie. I popped it in the old PS3 and went to Blu-ray live to see what was available and it was just trailers, including the movie's trailer, which you could download in HD or stream in SD. I figured I'd download it later.     The movie came up with a trailer for \\"Black Dynamite\\" that was awesome. I skipped the next trailer. The menu screen came up and was nicely done with scenes from the movie. It gave the option to watch with MovieIQ or without and I chose to watch without this time.     The opening is perhaps one of the best parts of the movie and actually this part of it I don't care JC and DL are no where to be found. This is a great car chase and gun fight, expertly directed and filmed and does not look like DTV at all. It could have easily been a scene from a Bourne movie, just plucked out and put into this movie--that's how well done it was.     I like the subtle cues from Arlovski (NGU) (he looks down at his arm after being shot, but isn't bothered by it) that lead the viewer to see something isn't right about these kidnappers. They seem superhuman and they are. From the museum, to the car chase and ultimately the helicopter liftoff, you have a great dramatic action sequence of events that is spectacular.     The movie slows a bit to give everyone a breather, and to establish the overall plot of the movie. You have the main bad guy (Commander Topov) speaking in Russian (subtitles are fairly easy to read, but sometimes you have white on white and you miss something) and telling everyone what he wants and why he kidnapped the Russian premier's two children. During his \\"voiceover\\" Hyams plays out scenes of violence and takeover very well. Music is particularly effective in scenes like these to give you the mood of despair.     Dr. Colin is introduced as he barks orders at generic soldiers who are working for Topov. For me he was overacted and I was happy when he met his demise. He was a little over-the-top to me. Ironically, he had more personality and is more memorable than Topov. Kristopher Van Varenberg plays Dr. Colin's assistant in a few scenes and he is actually good for what the scenes were.     With all this mess going on, the US is working with the Russians to resolve this bomb and kidnapping threat. Many of the characters introduced have brief time and are throwaways--including the 4 original Unisols that are sent in and are killed rather easily by Arlvoski's NGU. I like the scene where Dr. Porter briefs the regular soldiers about the history of the Black Tower and White Tower Unisol programs. The clips are well set up and directed and give the series some depth and background, considering it loosely is related to US1and US2, as the time frames just don't match up. As a viewer you have to almost guess how this is related to the others. It could just as well be a standalone film. I think I may have thrown in one flashback scene from US1 just to give homage to it and remind people this is the same universe that the first one was in.     The scene with Luc and Dr. Flemming in a cabin is a rather poignant scene as it shows how vulnerable Luc has become and how he is trying rehabilitation to become completely human again. (Which brings to question, what happened to him after US2? This is where some time frames don't make sense. The doctor mentions Luc is making a lot of progress compared to 2 years earlier when they found him. Found him where? Found him when? 2 years after US1 or 2 years after US2?) The second scene with Dr. Flemming in the restaurant is a missed opportunity for homage to US1. Luc is sitting there listening to the Doc and sees a guy whom he thinks is approaching him. They could have had a flashback scene to the diner from US1 or they could have had him re-enact a similar \\"diner scene\\" here in this restaurant. Instead it is a brutal attack against an innocent patron and no real explanation as to why he snapped.    In the meantime, they establish more scenes of Arlovski's NGU stalking first generation Unisols and other soldiers almost like a Predator. His scenes are good, but he has no real presence other than the big brainwashed killing machine--which I guess he is supposed to be--but then again this does nothing for his future unless he is going to play a killing machine in every subsequent movie.     Mike Pyle is the real surprise and is far better than Arlovski in nearly all of his scenes. He isn't going to win any academy award be he gives a great performance as a regular United States soldier who, through skill, is almost a super soldier himself. He is believable in his scenes and he is able to keep the movie from slumping in the non-Arlovski, JC and DL scenes. (And with him being cloned at the end, it's clear that IF there is another US movie, he will be in it.)    When the terrorists demands are met and Topov plans to pack up things and leave, Dr. Colin brings in Andrew Scott, or a clone of him, and just like old times, Scott over-kills Topov and looks like he is enjoying it too much. Dolph shines so much in such a brief time. He gets up from killing Topov and confronts Dr. Colin by asking Colin the same questions that Colin was asking him as part of a reboot process, if you will. Dr. Colin, quirky as ever, tells Scott that Scott isn't the one to be asking questions and to obey him. Well, Scott takes him and gives him a free eye exam with no co-pay. Classic Dolph moment and a big welcome back to the infamous Sgt. Scott.    Meanwhile, the U.S. government has broken into Luc's cabin and kidnapped him and are getting ready to initiate him back into the Unisol program as it's clear that they have no other choice. (This is were belief has to be suspended, as why is one first generation Unisol going to have any better luck against the NGU than the other four that met their demise in about 10 minutes? Answer: Because this one is JCVD!)  There is a nice training sequence of Luc, where he trains with small firearms and close-quarters combat. I understand that some of this is not JC and I don't get that as this is easy stuff that an actor should be doing himself. I understand he had limited time, but come on.     The last scene with Dr. Fleming, you have a concerned Luc who knows he is about to lose whatever humanity he regained, but still cares about her safety. She refuses to leave him alone while he completes the transformation back to a Unisol. He grabs her like he is going to kill her but lets her go and he is a full-fledged zombie again, with a single goal, rescue the hostages. JC's acting is good for his limited screen time and his moments with the doctor are some of the best. This scene is especially good as he gets right back to how he was in the US1.    The long shot that everyone is talking about where the camera tracks Luc across the frozen landscape as he heads to the enemy HQ, killing everything in his way, is awesome. No other word. It is the beginning of \\"JCVD\\" replayed in this movie. It looks epic due to the way the Hyams captured it. JC looks formidable and he goes from an assault rifle to small arms to knife combat and you get some of the best action sequences in years. The choreography is outstanding and the blood is flowing all over as Luc kills one bad guy after another.    The eventual fight with JC and DL is somewhat of a letdown. Of course, it is cool to see the two fight again, but the fight itself, the length of the fight, and the context of the fight all bother me, the two times I've seen it. First of all, when Luc comes across Scott, Luc just stares--some recognition in his face--but nothing else. He says nothing. If he had said \\"Sarge\\" I would have fallen off the sofa. After all, Scott was experiencing old memories, why not Luc? Scott mutters stuff and Luc listens. The homage is clearly the two kidnapped children in the corner, like the two Vietnamese ones in US1. It was nice, but it could have been longer and more poignant. Luc attacks Scott in no time and they engage in a who can break down more walls in a row the fastest. There are some kicks and punches, but nothing like the ones in US1. This is more brutal, more close-combat. It's more grappling and wrestling than JC doing a jumping roundhouse to DL's head. The fight lasts 5 min. or so and Luc dispatches Scott with far more ease than in US1. It was way too quick and left me with a glass half empty feeling.     Luc manages to locate the kidnapped children and they follow him as he is attacked by Alovski's NGU. The fight between them in only marginally better than the fight between Luc and Scott. There are some good kicks by JC and the end fight is decent, but nothing as grand as in US1. I understand the location was limiting and there's only so many ways of making the same \\"warehouse\\" look exciting for fight setups, but by the last fight I was kind of glad. Don't get me wrong, the last 30 minutes are some of the best in a long time, but still I felt a bit letdown.     Overall, this is a solid movie. I liked it a lot, but throughout, something kept telling me that as much as I was liking it, it had the potential to be so much better had the emphasis not been on Arlovski and had JC and DL had more time. Hyams, Jr.'s direction is excellent. Hyams, Sr.'s cinematography was superb as it always is. The music was almost non-existent, but for the mood of this movie, it fit it. It accented what it was supposed to, but didn't drown out the creepy, claustrophobic atmosphere that was created. In the end it was bittersweet though, to see two iconic action heroes back onscreen, but for such a small amount of time. But I'll take what I can get.     Directing: 8/10  Acting: 6/10  Cinematography: 8/10  Music: 7/10  Sound Design: 7/10    Overall: 7/10 (or 4/5 stars on Amazon)
B002PMV9FG|3.0|If you are a fan of Harry Potter, then this movie will continue your love of Potterworld. If you have not been keeping up with Harry's exploits, this is not the movie to introduce you to his world.  It feels like the middle of the story.  I realize that this is basically a \\"middle story\\" in the books, but if you are new to Potterworld then you would not want to start with this movie. It begins almost exactly where the last movie ended; It might be a good idea to watch 'Order of the Phoenix' before watching this movie to avoid feeling a bit lost at the beginnning as I did. The story carries on and the end leaves you feeling as if it were unfinished; not really reaching its own resolution but merely a breathing point before taking off on the next HP adventure.<br />The effects were enjoyable and the story was good.<br /><br />The dvd itself was not packaged very well and the case was cracked when it arrived.

In the last week all I've listened to this album repeatedly.  I really enjoyed their first two albums and this album is something different from the first two but equally as good if not better(IMHO).  I highly recommend this album if you appreciate the sound they are going for on this album.  This was a really pleasant surprise for me and I look forward to seeing them later this month on tour.

B001PPLIFU|4.0|I thought this was going to be a very good movie after watching Daniel Craig in Casino Royale.  The movie was a dud.  The Blu-ray disc was fine.  I guess I'm writing a review for the disc, not the contents. :-)  One thing I wish it included was a DVD copy of the movie.
B002GJU54E|5.0|Throughout the Janet Evanovich books, the more that came out, the more bad reviews there were.  I read the reviews for this book and waited for the paperback because of some of the bad ones.  I worried for no reason.  With the exception of Plum Lucky, I  have loved all of the books.      This one was filled with fun laughs about monkeys and Diesel, of course.  Its not like the other books where when Diesel comes into play, Ranger and Morelli leave.  In this book you get to see all three of Stephanie's Hunks.  The plot is interesting and will keep you guessing.  The new characters are very interesting and Wulf gave me the heebie geebies.    Bottom Line: Ignore the bad reviews, this book was great!
B001GCUNW6|2.0|I, like some of the other reviewers, had audio mastering issues with the blu-ray on my LG 370 player.  I returned the original DVD to Amazon thinking it was a blu-ray issue, but the replacement did the same thing.  I even called the 20th Century Fox help line and all they could do is suggest that I either make sure the blu-ray player was using up-to-date software (which it was) or contact LG & inform them of the problem.  Luckily the movie came with a DVD copy too, but it was very disappointing that the blu-ray was not viewable.

0670021652|5.0|It has to be so very hard for an author who writes such a publishing phenomenon has \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" to publish that next book. The expectations of the reading public are huge and the desire to read another book along the same vein is enormous. If the reader is expecting to pick up this new book by Elizabeth Gilbert and get, EPL 2, they will be disappointed. The author has changed and evolved as a person and she can't go back and duplicate what was already done. In this new book, she explores her life after the time period of EPL and her reaction to the institution of marriage. This subject becomes of utmost importance to her since she wants to build a life with the Brazilian she met in Bali and he can no longer enter the United States without being married to her (too many border crossings and time in the US without a legal connection).<br /><br />I thought EPL was great and I think this new work is also great (different but great). Ms. Gilbert's solution for trying to get comfortable with the institution of marriage is to try to understand it through doing as much research as she possibly can while moving from country to country waiting for the US officials to clear her fianc&eacute; to enter the country and for them to actually get married. It is obvious the author is a thinker and an analyzer. She has a deep-seeded skepticism regarding marriage after an ugly divorce and she appears to take the philosophy that understanding something makes you fear it less. She spends the length of the book exploring how marriage has evolved over time and over various cultures - it used to be that people didn't get married until the female was pregnant since why get married if you aren't going to be able to produce children. I particularly enjoyed the discussion about the Western view of marriage (the spouse completes you and is your soul mate) versus other cultures where the spouses have a role but aren't expected to meet every need. The author spends a fair amount of time examining the Christian church's evolving stance on marriage and I found it highly informative and interesting. The discussion may be offensive to some since it does expose how the church has changed its view drastically and dispels the notion that the clergy has always supported the institution of marriage.<br /><br />I found the book to be interesting more scholarly than EPL. While Ms. Gilbert spends time sharing her philosophy about marriage and her deeply personal thoughts on the topic, this is only one part of the book. As I said at the top of the review - let this book stand on its own and you probably will enjoy it if you like this type of writing. If you expect another book just like EPL, you will be disappointed.the Christian church's evolving stance on marriage and I found it highly informative and interesting.

B002JVWR4U|5.0|So often good, intriguing science fiction teases the viewer with intrigue and possibilities, then falls flat when the \\"resolution\\" is revealed. I'm thinking of the TV show \\"Life on Mars.\\" Well, \\"Dollhouse\\" not only draws you along with artful mystery and suggestion, in the end it knocks your socks off with the storyline and the conclusion. I agree with another reviewer who says this show packs in more story in it's two short seasons than many shows do over five seasons (think \\"Lost\\" which is incredibly uneven in terms of actual content). This may be due in part to the one-season reprieve Josh Whedon got to continue the story - so he had to pack a lot of story in a short number of episodes. Why can't all TV be this intense?    I can't recommend this show enough if you're a fan of science fiction set in the contemporary world. For me, this is one of THE BEST sci fi shows I've ever seen.

B000F8O35U|5.0|I forgot how much I really like this movie until I got it and watched it. I had woken up in the wee hours one night and for some reason came across the Disney channel who was advertising The Little Mermaid on next...so I stayed awake to watch it only to realize they turned it into a TV show. It drove me crazy suddenly I had to see the movie! Tried all my local video stores and all said the same thing...they stopped stocking it because people would rent it (and any other big Disney classic) and then never return them. So I am now the proud owner of the Little Mermaid and am a happy camper. I haven't checked out the bonus dvd stuff but if you like the movie it is a good deal.

Funny, outrageous and at times you can actually see him. Ozzy is the original wild man of rock and roll.  I highly suggest you pick up a copy...I haven't laughed so hard in ages.

1427208476|4.0|I highly reccomend Sarah's Key.  It is well written, is a page turner, heartwarming and very emotional.  It touches a part of history that most people may not be familiar with, however after reading the book this mostly unforgotton part of history will stay with you and you will never forget it.
0061703257|3.0|Dennis Lehane is one of the best writers currently producing books. He has the ability to write in a very engaging style that draws the reader in. He can express emotion and atmosphere quickly and convincingly. His main characters are incredibly fleshed out and very deep. However, I didn't think this was one of his better books due to the ending.<br />  I really enjoyed getting to know the main character. He's a very well developed man of strengths and weaknesses. I found myself caring for his quest and his overall well being. The world he enters into on the island is a spooky one. The book definitely imparts a level of paranoia and fear every time we open the pages. This is a very atmospheric book.<br />  For all the strengths, the book totally falls apart due to the twist and the ending. The twist is one I thought was obvious and quite cliched. I think if you have a mind for anagrams or have encountered a lot of stories with twists, this will be an easy guess for you. It's just not very clever and worse, it takes a great story and makes it totally irrelevant.<br />  Twist endings are a tricky beast. There's the kind that come almost totally out of the blue and redefine the story - the good ones pay off all the build-up before the twist (think Million Dollar Baby), the bad ones are just silly (the Village). Then there's the kind that have the entire story build to them - good ones leave clues and everything fits together like a puzzle, the bad ones have tons of clues, some that contradict other clues, and force the story to serve the twist. Shutter Island is the last kind - the twist is obvious and doesn't even make sense in context of some of the scenes. I think Lehane would have been much better off just telling a straight story and letting the conclusion come naturally from the story he was telling rather than trying to force his twist onto the story.<br />  I give this book 3 stars because it's written so well, but I'd recommend avoiding the story if you have a mind with any propensity for logical puzzles.ind with any propensity for logical puzzles.

B002N1AF7W|3.0|I am going to enter a review which I feel is an honest assessment but will annoy some of the previous reviewers (at least).<br />Now I love this album and have owned a copy in some form or other since its debut in '77.<br /><br />I jumped at the chance to buy my two favourites when they were remastered ( The Mix and Man Machine.)<br /><br />Upon listening to The Mix I thought there was very little upgrading of the sound in the upper frequencies, and any improvement to the bass was caused by the recording being slightly louder only.<br /><br />I subsequently read the \\"glowing\\" reviews for the Man Machine and thought it must be true that it is vastly improved. Not.<br /><br />To verify my suspicions, I played my analogue master cd back to back with the new remaster...and came to the conclusion that I could get the same sound simply by turning up the volume on the old copy.
B0021L8UQ2|4.0|This is pretty little good creepy evil child movie.like THE OMEN OR BAD SEED type the style to it,Alots intense/scary moments then real good till end with a great twist I didn't expect come that way,  But didn't made well in the box office because might people didnt much about this little thriller ride, but IS well made with great script, good acting & solid cast.. They done a great job executed in screen! Gives a try that's for sure! After all bought it for my DVD/horror collections!B+
0765356147|4.0|Summary:  --------  The Hero of Ages is a satisfying conclusion to the Mistborn trilogy by Brandon Sanderson.  The battle between Preservation and Ruin come to a very dramatic conclusion and a very interesting beginning for what will hopefully be a new series.  The novel wraps up all the lose ends but it takes a long time to get there.  My only issue with the novel is that it could have been editted down by 150 to 200 pages without losing anything in the condensation.    World Setting:  --------------  The world is very well developed with some very interesting concepts.  The classic battle between good and evil is switched to a battle between Preservation and Ruin/chaos.  Creation is not possible without some part Preservation and Ruin which is the crux of the conflict.  It is a good point played out very well.      Characters:  -----------  The characters are well developed and make for very enjoyable reading.  Most of the main characters do not survive which just feels right considering the world is just about to be destroyed.  The author respects the scale of destruction/chaos very well.      Prose:  ------  The writing style is very effective and enjoyable.  The only issue is that the amount of writing could be condensed without sacraficing anything.  The descriptions are quite affective.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|I saw the documentary 'All Together Now' they did about the 'Love' Beatles show in Las Vegas and just couldn't get over how awesome the music sounded. I've been a life long Beatles fan so I came on here to see if they had made a soundtrack. THANK GOODNESS they had!! I have almost literally played a hole in this CD.<br /><br />The fact that the masters were reworked for the show by George Martin and his son Giles only makes it better. No one could have done a better job that the original magic man. The way some of the songs flowed into each other was just brilliant.<br /><br />If you're a Beatles fan you HAVE to own this CD!
B002HWUU1I|5.0|I fell in love with Glen and Marketa after having seen ONCE. Bought the soundtrack, listened to it for weeks all day long. Couldn't wait to get their new cd and though I JUST got it, I think I've played it enough times as if I'd bought it when it came out in Oct. and listened to it once daily. I love it!!!!!!! Their voices together are magic! I totally recommend it.
B00008WT5E|5.0|\\"POWERAGE\\" by AC/DC, is one of few albums that re-energized the rock music scene in it'era!  The other two were VH1 and Def Lepard'S High&Dry.  Like the last two mentioned, POWERAGE has remained viable and certainly one of the finest efforts that AC/DC has produced!  I most highly reccommend this recording for any one who has not listened to it, or as a reignition tool for anybody who has but has lost their drive.  This recording is compelling!!!

B002GHHJU4|3.0|This is my first experience in the Jennifer's Body universe. I'm waiting for [[ASIN:1608865010 Jennifer's Body]] to arrive from Amazon, and will be getting the Blu-Ray from the UK because the idiots at Fox think it's financially viable to region-lock their Blu-Ray discs.    The soundtrack is something you wouldn't associate with something that claims it resembles a horror film. It has echoes of the songs Juno had, but, dare I say it, more \\"hardcore\\". Yeah, that seems right - \\"Hardcore Juno\\".    Not hardcore with thrashing heads and heavy metal, hardcore as in more heavy than the music on Juno's fifty-billion editions of the soundtrack.    A few songs stand out: obviously, Panic! At The Disco's \\"New Perspective\\" is catchy a short and sweet for those who like Panic! (like me), \\"Kiss With A Fist\\" by Florence and the Machine is worth a few listens, but is nothing ground-breaking. Little Boots' \\"New In Town\\" is catchy and up-beat, and fits with what I've seen with the film perfectly. Cobra Starship's \\"Chew Me Up and Spit Me Out\\" is funky and dancey, and a pleasant listening experience. Probably by favourite song is \\"Toxic Valentine\\" by a band I've never heard of: All Time Low. Don't ask me why, I guess it just sounds awesome. I'll probably check their records out sooner or later.    The range of styles on here, there should be at least one song to please anyone that listens to this. Three stars.
B000002KKC|5.0|It's very hard to describe this album. It seems like this album is one GIANT MOOD SWING. Buckingham's songs seem manic and strong, Nicks songs seem introspective, angry, dreamy and dark. Mcvie's songs seem down-to-earth, hopeful and thoughtful. What a combination of talent! Somehow it all works. With each listen you discover something new. This album is a piece of art. The lyrics don't seem to important. Each songwriter manages to wrap you up in a different atmosphere with harmony and conviction. This album is truely great. Very hard to describe but highly recommended.

Warriors know the truth.  Wait for Lone Survivor to see the true face of Our Troops, of Our Current Conflicts. [...]
B0026P3G12|5.0|This album is just beautiful.. I have not heard an album in years that was so soothing as well as enjoyable.  Susan Boyle's voice makes one forget all the bad crap that goes on in this world today.  She can really make you have a relaxed state of mind................
B0026FCKVO|5.0|This is first rate Suspence, first rate acting. This is what all suspense/horror movies should aspire to. Forget present-day blood-splattered gorefests. This is eff-ing SCARY! I first saw this movie in the theater as a 12 year old boy (okay, that dates me) and it has never left me. I remember a poor young woman sitting a couple of rows in front of me standing up in one scene and screaming!!!  Her friends pulled her back down.<br />We are so de-sensitized today that I doubt anyone below the age of 35 (maybe 40?) can appreciate Audrey Hepburns' delimma (and excellent acting... or Alan Arkins' skin-crawling antics).<br />No other movie reaches the bar or has impressed me as much (unless it is \\"Requiem for a Dream\\"; I had to force myself to take a nap afterwards to Get Outa My Head!/MAKE IT STOP!!). \\"Wait Until Dark\\" has set the goldbar standard for me for Classy Suspense/ O God I Think I Just Pee-ed Myself a Little/Didn't See That Coming.

B002YICN74|5.0|This is a great CD! It is a little more edgy than a Jonas Brothers CD. And although it is still suitable for younger listeners, older listeners will find it very enjoyable. Nick, who is influenced by musicians such as Stevie Wonder, Prince, and Elvis Costello, has taken those influences and created songs with catchy music and meaningful lyrics that will stay in your head. Clearly this is not the end of Nick Jonas. He is a musician who, although young, shows that he has an enormous amount of talent. I would recommend this CD to anyone.

B000000XB9|4.0|Who would have thought?  To me, they sound like a group that should have come from Louisiana or Southern Mississippi because of their deep Delta bluesy swamp rock sound.<br /><br />This CD could have been improved just a little better.  I see that they gave us the whole version of \\"I've Heard It Through The Grapevine\\", but I really missed having the full version of \\"Suzie Q\\" as I've always known it.  I've never heard it cut short like it was here, and there is no excuse for it.  It would have fit on this CD, in addition, to having even one more bonus track, like \\"Born on a Bayou\\" or \\"Midnight Special\\".<br /><br />Oh well, I guess I'll just take what they give us and collect my own perceived shortcomings and make my own second Chronicles CD. The second Chronicles CD that they released, well, I could laugh.  The second half of \\"Suzie Q?\\"  What a joke!  I'll make my own 2 disc \\"Best of Creedance Clearwater Revival\\" because I do need \\"Ramble Tamble\\", \\"Keep on Chooglin'\\", and even, the two other tracks that I just mentioned, plus there are other great tracks.  Hell, I could even make a second collection that includes John Fogerty's \\"Rock and Roll Girls\\", \\"Centerfold\\", and \\"The Old Man Down the Road\\" from 1984.  It's so easy to make a second CD of CCR to complement this release of Chronicles.  So, thanks for the effort anyway.

I've sampled some of Lara's other albums but they just don't compare to this one in style and grace. Her voice just stands out so much when its not accompanied by so much of the background instruments as in some of her more pop albums. Here it's simply a piano, and a string quartet. Quite simple, but the combination with her voice is extremely beautiful. I hope she does another intimate album like this in the near future.  She is at her best in this style.
0545123267|3.0|In the midst of the Twilight fanaticism comes a book not about sparkly vampires, but werewolves.  These werewolves are vastly different from Meyer's, as they change into wolves only when the air is cold enough, and they stay that way either when the air warms up, or in some cases, forever.  Shiver is about a werewolf named Sam who is often seen in his wolf form by Grace outside her window in the winter time.  They eventually meet in unlikely circumstances when Grace feels the need to protect Sam after he shifts unexpectedly into his human form.      Now, this all seems like the standard plot for pretty much any werewolf or supernatural novel, however, Stiefvater manages to build a character-driven plot filled with mystery and suspense.  When not focusing on Sam and Grace's relationship, Shiver revolves around Sam's past and his 'pack' that slowly seems to be disintegrating.  The bad part of this plot is that Stiefvater's novel reads like she forgot she was going to implement something later in the story, so when you reach a few chapters, you wonder, \\"Why was I not introduced to this before?\\"  After you encounter some scenes like that, you start to wonder why they don't appear in the rest of the book.      Stiefvater's style of writing, however, is poetic and moving.  I could picture nearly every scene she described, down to the smell and the shade of the colors.  I felt she struggled with making me believe the situations though, and her character design (while somewhat believable and intriguing) felt a bit stiff.  Grace is the girl with parents without parents, and I felt like this detracted from her character.  This issue, fortunately, is discussed in the book.  Some characters were even a bit too stereotypical, which I'll admit as a writer is a very hard thing to get away from.  Even then, Stiefvater should've found a way to avoid this.      While reading this, I so desperately wanted there to be tied ends at the end of the novel, but that's not what happens.  Ifyou're looking for a book that simply ends, don't bother with this one.  The utterly odd ending of this novel left me confused more than surprised and happy (which is how I think Stiefvater wanted the reader to feel).  If you're looking for a simple read with intrigue and vivid scenery but little in the way of character development, go for this one.      Before I finish this review, I feel like I need to point some things out about some of the other reviews who are claiming this to be similar to Twilight.  Let me begin by saying that I am in no way a fan of the Twilight series and in my personal opinion Twilight is absolute self-image damaging garbage (I have read all four books so don't accuse me of having not).  While Shiver bears similar characteristics to Twilight, Stiefvater's writing is more talented than Meyer's and I think that there's something unique to be found in Shiver.  If you weren't a fan of Twilight, this book will either surprise or bore you.  If you're a Twilight fan, you'll enjoy this, as the romance is far more believable and the plot is far more advanced.     I will be picking up Linger when it comes out though, as the descriptions in this book are so vivid I think I could learn something from them.
B0000TG9E2|1.0|So yet another DVD that does not play correctly.

(and no, it is not my dvd player, I always test on multiple working players)
031606792X|1.0|Words cannot begin to describe how I feel about this book.  I was a devoted fan of the Twilight series for many years, and even went to a Barnes and Noble Party for the release.  When it came to the Island Esme scene, I began to realize how utterly horrible this book was going to be.  After reading this, book, I went back to the first three to see that they are JUST AS BAD.  If I could give negative stars, I would.      There is offense and damaging portrayals in this book, from a woman who can't have kids being commented on as 'she wasn't as female as she should be' and 'what was she now?'.  Those words are ACTUALLY in the book.  I'm sorry, Stephenie Meyer, but since when does not being able to have children constitue as NOT BEING FEMALE?  If someone can't have kids they are still a woman.  There are more moments of ridiculousness in this book, from Jacob watching women women creepily in a park (like a rapist might), to fountains of blood (were there tiers?), to women needing to be 'controlled' and men performing 'heroic' acts by talking about ending someone's pregnancy AGAINST THEIR WILL.      There's racism, transphobia,and classism littered throughout the pages.  The Cullens are described as so white they sparkle, and have enough money to buy islands and nearly every rare expensive car.  I felt like Meyer's ideals were being shoved down my throat.  Alice won't let people wear an outfit more than once (classism and wealth?) and the Cullens seem hollow and selfish.  I can hardly begin on Rosalie, who seems to be the most vapid and useless character in literary history.  Bella, however, remains the special and unique snowflake she's been since book one, and is always complaining about how she doesn't deserve either of them.  Newsflash, Bella: you don't deserve two men who constantly abuse you emotionally and make you think their way is right.  There are plenty of better guys out there (remember Mike Newton from book one?).    SPOILERS  After Bella's transformation,she CONTINUES to be just the greatest thing ever graced upon earth, and I find that this has gone beyond Mary-Sue into some kind of god who can do absolutely no wrong.  These 2-D characters bore me throughout the rest of the book, and although I tried to get excited for the Volturi battle (that DIDN'T EVEN HAPPEN ANYWAY) I just felt the plot was lacking.      This book is about a group of stupid horrible people who go around doing stupid horrible things that make things 500x worse than they should be.    I hate this book.

B00127RAJY|4.0|This is a great video if you're short on time (30 minutes overall)and it will kick your butt but I don't think doing it for 30 days straight is good for your knees.  I am in good shape and walk 4 miles regularly during the summer. I didn't have knee pain until I did this for 2 weeks straight.  My muscles did get toned (a little too much-adding bulk to my butt and thighs) but the 2 minutes of cardio in between the weight training is very high impact- jumping jacks, butt kicks, jump rope in place.  And that was just level one. There are three levels.  You are supposed to do level 1 for 10 days, level 2 for 10 days and level 3 for 10 days.  I think it would be more effective when alternating with a cardio DVD.      Great DVD overall but be careful.

B002R5V7MG|3.0|The Mahler performance is good.  But will it be so good twenty years from now?  Is this really a version that can supplant Kubelik, or, God forbid, Bruno Walter?  Frankly, I thought there were moments that were somewhat shallow, where key details were buried beneath the romantic flow.  And the sound is stunningly lacking in nuance.<br /><br />As for the L.A. Philharmonic, they sounded infinitely better when Maazel conducted them in Sibelius 2nd in January.  On this Mahler DG live recording the strings sound thin.  Fault of the recording?  I don't know.<br /><br />I'm a subscriber to the L.A.  I've been knocked out by Dudamel a few times already.  I expect great things.  But let's not lose our reason over this.<br /><br />As for the opening piece...the finest moments reminded me what a remarkable film composer Jerry Goldsmith was (especially in his score for \\"Chinatown).

So loving the big G i made my dad take me to see this opening day at our local theatre. I was 9 years old and i was waiting to see him mess up tokyo, not seeing any preveiws. I was ok with it being new york, i love that town and it shocked me to see it get the S@#T kicked out of it. Then we see godzilla, for me being nine i should have loved the t-rex look, but i  wanted godzilla. I would watch this movie allot on video cause this is the only G movie my father liked. i hated it for years cause to me it was not godzilla. But looking back as i am no 20, i have this in my dvd collection. It does take in allot of aspects of other g films. it is kind of close to the original american release of king of the monsters, and 1985. and has aspects of other monster films the beast from 20,000 fathoms. But this is a good movie, its fun, its action packed. and it could have been godzilla, but its just zilla. its a good movie and fun. i love it and i love all the other godzilla films, i have em all on dvd, three of em i own on region 3 cause america hasnt released any copys yet. that being said this is a good movie and worth the price. the features are just good, better than others worse than others, but its sounds and looks great. get it and eat allot of popcorn cause thats what this is. its a popcorn movie.

She sings about the same things. She does the same things. Not even Sasha Fierce could save her this year from her usual predictive self, and let me tell you. I'm not impressed!    After releasing this boring expected piece of material about 10 different ways, I ask myself, just how money hungry this screeching banshee really is.    Anyways, for the people that are impressed by this garbage should get back to their pharmacist for potential refills.    One thing Beyoncé does best is Filler.  she sure knows how to cloud good singles in the midst of complete trash.    People save your money and go support a real artist.  Madonna, Lady Gaga, Bette Midler, Jewel.  Even Jennifer Lopez can deliver a great cd from start to finish.    If you're thinking about buying this. i suggest you get the singles (that by the way sound just like her previous work) and skip the rest.    Beyoncé i'm not impressed. Better luck next time, hopefully, by 2020 maybe you'll show some signs of growth.    but God knows i won't be waiting that long. I won't be holding my breath on that one.

I highly recommend this to anyone who has ever had even a remote interest in Bob Dylan.

1416594787|4.0|Overall, this book presents condensed scientific evidence in support of evolution; these data provide valuable talking points for both those wishing to understand evolution by natural selection, and those who wish to defend it against its few critics.  For the most part, Dawkins describes somewhat complex scientific data in simple language. Unlike Dawkins' other works, this book is inclusive to those of faith, and attempts to unite supporters of evolution on all fronts.       Positive aspects: This entire book is worth the read for two chapters alone.  1) A chapter explaining evolutionary mechanisms within microorganisms (specifically Richard Lenski's famous experiments on bacteria).  2) A chapter detailing various methods of dating layers of Earth's surface, coupled with a complementary analysis of the fossils found within.    Negative aspects: On a few occasions Dawkins gets off topic, though he warns the reader that from time to time he will do so for entertaining reasons.  There were also a few occasions where I wondered why Dawkins presented a particular scientific study; it was not entirely clear to me.    Conclusion: This book is invaluable when pointing out the logical fallacies of those opponents of evolution.  Again, it affords the reader basic tools to defend evolution in the public sphere via an understanding of how these evolutionary mechanisms work. This book is best for, but certainly not limited to, those with a strong interest in science.

B002ONC9NC|5.0|I've known people who've lived through this exact situation.  The parents let their underage daughter date an older man. This girl is 16 when she meets him and he is in his late 30s. It is set in the early-middle 1960s and the girl is aspiring to go to Oxford.  However, she finds it dreary that a hard academic life will lead to a rather dull career in teaching or government work.  So dates to concerts, fine restaurants, jazz clubs and eventually trips to Oxford and Paris turn her head.  Carey Mulligan and Peter Saarsgard are outstanding as the couple.  I've always admired Saarsgard's ability to become just about anyone and he certainly does it again here, even becoming believably English (he does not play an American in England, which is the way this is usually done).<br /><br />The parents are very good too, especially Alfred Molina as her father.  I can now see how this situation could happen. I don't think everyone's parents would give in to the older man. However, with these two, I can see they are easily conned, stolid middle class folks who have never been up against this level of charm and finesse before.  I expected to find them contemptible but did not.  I expected to find her dopey and did not.  Saarsgard's character is complex.  I would like to say I detested him but I ended up wanting to know more, especially how he came to be the way he is.<br /><br />This is a highly volatile issue, especially in America, an adult being sexually active with a minor.  One must keep a few things in mind though.  First, this is set roughly fifty years ago, when a lot of young women married fresh out of high school and their other horizons were limited.  Second, the parents and the girl are seduced into this but it is not like everyone around them is in favor of this.  There are plenty of outraged people who take a stand, especially her teacher and headmistress.  Third, in the real life situations I've seen develop and in this film one, the man is always affluent.  This factor always seems to a deciding one, tipping the scales towards him.<br /><br />I did not think this was a permissive or tolerant movie about this situation, as some people have claimed.  In fact, it might be a good wakeup call for a lot of parents to see this.  I highly recommend this film.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00275EGWY|4.0|I am not a Iraq war veteran, but only a simple Vietnam war veteran, so let me tell you that this movie shows the intensity of being an American soldier in a country where the everyday citizens may or may not want you there. For me that was the message of this movie. Besides that the sheer intensity of the film equaled the first 30 minutes of \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" which is saying a lot. This film is almost too intense to bear.<br /><br />I have a negative comment about the movie which may seem minor to some and that is the showing of a lame cat near the beginning and another shot of a cat running across the screen later on. I know the intent was to show realism but wars are all about humans killing each other and I do not need to see injured animals when I watch a war movie. This may seem to be minor to some but to me it is major and it is why I gave this movie 4 stars instead of 5.
1594488916|5.0|I gave up collecting several years ago but this story made me want to start again!  The personality disorder of the protagonist is truly fascinating and this is a great read about this history of books and those who seek rare and first edition books.  In our increasingly electronic society and culture, its nice to be reminded of the beauty and attraction of books. Above all this is a fascinating crime story with an interesting twist at the conclusion.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|I am a major Star Trek fan don't get me wrong but this movie is totally unwatchable and it is not because of the actors or the story but because of the endless lens flare and camera overlay. I have no idea what they were thinking of but they made a movie so hard on the eyes that they rendered the story meaningless with their jumpy camera work and cheap \\"special effects\\". There may have been a great story here but I was too distracted by the sloppy direction to pay attention to the story. I would rather watch \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\" anyday than this hunk of junk movie.
B002NWRMVS|3.0|Norah Jones is one of my favorites, and I do like all that she does, but this CD seemed a little flat to me and the songs too similar.  I've practically worn out her previous CDs from playing them over and over.  The Fall will likely be added to my iPod and played whenever \\"Random\\" pulls it up.  That said, I'll still buy her next CD!
0307454541|5.0|This book was titled \\"Men Who Hate Women\\" in  its native Sweden - while accurate, the name change was a wise move as the book is much more about our lively protagonists than villains.  I thought it was time to give up on fiction when I  finally got around to read this book.  Glad to so say it made the embers of my interest in fiction glow again would be an understatement: I devoured this book.  I've been to Sweden a few times and part of my interest in the book was being familiar with the areas mentioned n the book, but any book could have done that.  What makes Larson's book so incredibly readable is the use of dual protagonists.  One is obviously an idealized version of the author; he's likeable but a bit boring.  The other is the perfect foil.  If you don't know much about the book, I won't spoil it by going into detail, suffice to say she is now one of my favorite characters.  When you start reading this book, discovering her will be a memorable pleasure.<br /><br />As highly as I recommend this book, I have to mention one incredibly odd thing about this book.  The story ends one hundred (86 pages, really) before the book ends.  Basically, the main story ties up nicely but Larson wanted to tie up all the loose ends and a joyless sub-plot.  It's obvious the reason the story goes is because Larson wrote himself into the male protagonist and wants to let him shine.  But he doesn't shine - he's like the straight man in a comedy duo.  He works great in setting up his teammate but, alone, he's nothing special.  The extended ending read like watching the deleted scenes from a movie - they were enjoyable, but don't add to what was otherwise a masterpiece.
B000000I7K|4.0|For Whom the Bells Tolls (Paramount 1943) is one of the highlights in screen legends Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman filmography.....The musical score by one of the most underrated composers in the history of cinema -Victor Young- reflects perfectly the nature of the film...It is a score to listen carefully and enjoy for a lifetime....
0060557818|5.0|Neverwhere is a fantastic story about where things go when the world forgets them, or they fall through the cracks (or gaps as another reviewer pointed out). Vividly told, with an unforgetable cast of characters, this twisting tale is some of the best contemporary fantasy there is. I recommend this book more highly than almost any other.
B000022TSY|5.0|The movie came in very good condition. It is a very great movie to watch. I love the motorcycles and freedom. I want to do that as well!
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I have collected Beatle albums since I first saw the Yellow Submarine and Hard Day's Night on television, 10 yrs old.  I fell in love with them and continue that zest even today.  I bought this set for pure pleasure and fell in love with them and their music all over again.  I introduced my 4 year old to them and she loves both St. Pepper's and the Yellow Submarine music.  She can belt out \\"A Little Help by my Friends\\" loud with gusto.  I have always admired their creative talents for years and exposed myself to all types of music just to appreciate them even more.  I like the sound of the cd's and recommend them to anyone who is a fan.
B002BW7A58|4.0|I would have to say that this....i wish lil wayne would stick to rapping. I cant say i dont like this album but the auto tune is too much on some songs before the album they put auto tune on his voice and it sounds good but on this Rebirth it is just too much it drowns out his voice. i do like the albumm and it does have some good tracks, and the production is great. but now that i have this and his latest mixtpae no ceilings. I would have to say i cant put no ceilings down it is awsome but this isnt anything i will be listening too alot. I give him credit for his creativity but he is just so much better at doing hip hop music.
0062502182|5.0|This is a great book.  I highly recommend this to readers of all ages.  The book was in great condition.  I love hand me down books because it's easier to turn the pages!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|It was very educational, but it was hard to get through because it was a bit boring. I recommend it if you want to know more about where food actually comes from.
B00275EGWY|1.0|I love war movies. I hated this one. Yes, characters can grow to love war, but no one who pulls the wires on bombs lives long enough to have defused the number of bombs he claims to have defused. He would not have been doing that. Why is it in the movie? It is in the script, so it is a lousy script.<br />A little realism in handling of bombs would have improved the movie 100%. The way it is written, he is the kind of guy who is going to have an \\"accident\\" after he endangers his unit one time too many.<br />I thought it was a typical inept effort by someone who has never really been to war. I know he was over there, the script guy, but he obviously wasn't disarming bombs.<br />I liked the depiction of Iraq, the dangers, etc, but the \\"hero\\" is an inept idiot, and the script that has him pulling bombs out of the sand, or the car, by the wires is just bad writing.<br />I can't believe it is getting nominated for Oscars, etc. There's a phrase from Vietnam: REMF. This is a REMF movie.
B00004RITP|5.0|This recording has shaken me. There is so much emotional content from this live performance of a piece so well loved by Maestro Rattle. The desperation and pain is so heartfelt in the orchestration that the reader can step right into Mahler's last years of life and experience it with him.     The fadeout at the conclusion of the final movement must rank as one of the finest ever recorded. Fadeouts such as Tchaikovsky 6 come to mind. Yet, nothing compares to this Mahler 10.     In my review of a (Wheeler) Mahler 10 recording my comments were skeptical. Were the final movements really Mahler? This recording is as close as we are going to get. The Berlin playing is so accomplished and lush. The dynamics are brought out so clearly by Maestro Rattle. Yet, this recording has a welcome gentle frailty, perhaps the unintended result of the sparse orchestration.     I have but a handful of recordings with the Berlin Phil that are not conducted by HVK or Furtwaengler. This recording is gladly a welcome addition to my collection of BPO recordings.     Mr. Cooke and Maestro Rattle with the Berliners have made a believer out of me. Essential.
