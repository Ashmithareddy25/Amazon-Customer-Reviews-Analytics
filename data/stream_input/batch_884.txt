B00005JXY3|3.0|The Karate Kid Part II is no way as memorable as the orginial but at least it's not unwatchable like Part III. Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita have always had this natural chemistry - you can tell they were really good friends on camera and off. Some of the acting from the supporting cast is just plain awful and the pace of the film is rather slow. So-so sequel - stick to the orginial.
B000ANXLB2|5.0|This is an excellent set of Beethoven's complete symphonic cycle. It has great sound and was nicely shot. However, I will say that, considering the price, DG should include commentaries of the Beethoven symphonies by Karajan himself as a bonus.

0241003008|1.0|I bought this book as I remember it from my childhood and it was one of my favorite stories.  I  wanted to have a copy around the house for the children in my family.  I had no idea that this book would be a miniaturized cheesy reproduction.  It's essentially worthless.  Children will not be able to get the full effect from this garbage undersized version.  Got to love corporate greed.  Shame on AMAZON, the author, and the publisher for peddling this subpar version.  DO NOT BUY THIS COPY.  It's smaller than a dollar bill. It is a great story, but you need to buy a bigger book than this one.  Good luck figuring out what the regular sized/traditional book would be.
B001PPLJIQ|3.0|When a \\"serious\\" movie like The Reader comes to your multi-plex, dragging rave reviews and award nominations, then you feel compelled to see it.  You do so, if you're like me, with that slight feeling of dread that this will be very long, very serious and very ambiguous.<br /><br />Kate Winslett deserved her Oscar for Best Actress as Hannah, the SS guard who deliberately helped murder hundreds of innocent jews. Her young lover, played by newcomer David Kross, was also outstanding. Other than that, the movie defies logic and leaves you wanting more.<br /><br />My biggest complaint was that the movie makers wants us to believe that the handsome, adorable German youth would fall in love with someone as scrubby, ugly and plain looking as the Hannah character.  Lust, yes. He's young and lusty and she might have been a brief sexual encounter before he goes out into the world.<br /><br />But we're supposed to believe that he loves her over the years--even after she's convicted by a court of mass murder. If possible, she looks even more grubby, plain and repulsive. She never shows us a trace of charm, wit or beauty. She's just a stolid mass of mangy hair and a plain body and she lives in a dark, depressing hovel of an apartment.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes portrays the lad as a grownup but he is so quiet and subdued and blank that his later admission to the daughter of a Nazi concentration camp is embarassing to watch. The close-up of him, in tears, and feeling so sorry for himself is cringe-worthy.<br /><br />I watched this in the movie theater and am glad I did. But once was enough. It's way too long, depending on never-ending close-ups and extended pauses before the movie moves again.<br /><br />This is a good movie to watch great acting. I just wish the story was more believable.
B000B8657S|5.0|Without trying to add to the discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the individual releases vs. the complete box set, I should like to point out that as of this writing (May 2009) these recordings are available on the Hyperion website for 25% and 55%, respectively, less than the Amazon price. The 37 individual disks come to GBP 390 and the box set is GBP 135. At the current exchange rate, this equals $620 (Amazon: c. $815) and $215 (Amazon: $480).    ADDITION (June 6): The individual CDs have subsequently been repackaged by Hyperion in standard jewel cases and several of them don't come with the full song-by-song notes any more.
B000PC0U1W|4.0|Never would I have thought to watch this movie on my own. Comic books/graphic novels have never interested me. Fortunately, a friend recommended it to me, so I broke out of my usual selections and gave it a shot. This is both an entertaining and thought provoking film, one which shines a revealing light on our own recent and current political climate.     If more people would, as I did, take a chance and view this film, they might find themselves having a better appreciation for freedom and see the dangers we succumb to when we willingly sacrifice our liberty for security. This film offers a vision of what occurs when a paternalist government seises ever more power \\"for your protection.\\" We should look at our own politicians skeptically, whether they promise to protect us from the danger of \\"terrorists\\" or \\"greedy capitalists.\\" Yes, this review is political, as so in the movie.

1847371264|5.0|What a tremendous find! Beautifully written and believable, with several unexpected plot twists to keep the reader involved till the last page. I've already ordered and now read the author's next book.
B0006GANOQ|5.0|Forget the sequel. This is the one that should be seen by every die-hard action movie fan. Alongside the Die Hard series and Terminator 2: Judgment Day, this is yet another action film that does its job well. It helps us escape from reality and make us watch a high-octane two-hour display of suspense, drama, and in several occasions, comedy. I still have no idea how they were able to film scenes on the slow-moving freeways of Southern California, but they sure accomplished in what they wanted and needed. Reeves, Bullock, Hopper, Daniels, and Morton give marvelous performances throughout the film. Hopper especially steals the show as the maniacal bomber who will stop at nothing in order to get what he wants. Mark Mancina's music score adds finer touches to this highly popular action film, while John Wright's editing really hits the spot. Jan De Bont's directorial debut should not be missed.
B001KX50BK|4.0|I know this sounds trivial, but I've perused through about 10 or 12 pages and can't find anything but people complaining about Julia's character being a hooker and deleted scenes.  What about the cover art?  Why'd they have to go and change that?  I know it's all about marketing, but \\"Pretty Woman\\" was originally written in pink, and there were full-body shots of both characters.  While this movie will always be one of my all-time favorites, I wish \\"the powers that be\\" would leave a good thing alone.  Oh well, I'll hold off on buying this until they decide to put the cover back the way it was.
B000001E7T|4.0|To Bring You My Love  being Harvey's 1995 release and received great reviews from the critics when the album was released and the album did reasonably well peaking at #12 in the UK Album charts and #40 in the Billboard 200. Singles of this album where \\"Down by the water\\", \\"C'Mon Billy\\" and \\"Send his love to me\\". The booklet contains no lyrics, some nice photos of Ms Harvey and a list of whom and what they play on each track. 4/5.
0143038419|3.0|I bought the book because of the media attention it received. Otherwise I would have assumed the book's subject would be boring. To my delight, it was entertaining. Elizabeth did a good job conveying her struggle to hold on to a life that contributed to her deep sadness. As I read Elizabeth's book, I thought of my mother's life as a young illiterate, poor immigrant abandoned in the U.S. with three children to care for. Despite facing far greater tragedies than Elizabeth, such as abuse, life threatening illnesses, loss of two children, murder, rape; she became self-made millionaire. Moreover, her spirit was unwavering in finding good and purpose in all life situations. Elizabeth, among other memoir authors, inspired me to write my mother's story, Mama Moon. If Elizabeth's struggle to renew her life after divorce could inspired so many, then surely, Mama Moon will do the same or more.
B000KGGLCU|3.0|The Confessions Tour - Live from London (CD+DVD)  is an alright concert with Madonna proving the point that she is only a so so singer. She sounds so much better in the studio versions. The sound quality is amazing but some of the old tracks sound like they have added to many layers of noise and they feel a bit top heavy. The booklet is not that impressive and the quality of the photos is subpar. 3/5.
0515141429|4.0|This book is pretty good. I was a little worried about reading this type, because it was a little bit out of my league of choices. But once I started reading it, it got better and better. Reacher does appear realistic, even though some of the military stuff isn't exactly on point. I like the way Child makes his character think. Child told me he was concerned about me reading this because some of the graphic violence in it (he knows I like the cozy), but it surprised me by being less than gross than what I feared. This is a book worth reading, and as the series goes on, you can see Reacher change his manner, if not his attitude about people.
B001IBIQU6|4.0|Sounds Of The Universe  being Depeche Mode's 12th studio album and their 2009 release was a massive hit all over the world peaking at #1 in Germany, Argentina, Australia and Sweden. On the Billboard 200 it peaked at #3. Singles that have been released so far is Wrong but the second single to be released is Peace which will be released 15th June. The booklet is quite odd and I have no idea what the graphics on the front are supposed to represent. 4/5.
0698116496|5.0|From the balloon that gradually floats off toward the moon to the clock in the zookeeper's bedroom that marks the time it takes to get the animals all back into bed, there is a lot of subtle humor and fun in this book.  My 2-year old can't get to sleep without it.  She has learned the word \\"inconspicuous\\" in connection with the way the elephant looks before he's discovered in the bedroom.  This is a special book  - right up there with _Good Night Moon_.
B00005ASHM|4.0|Pet Sounds  being The Beach Boys 11th studio album and their 1966 release and singles released on the album were \\"Caroline No\\", \\"Wouldn't it be nice\\", \\"Sloop John B\\" and \\"God Only Knows\\". Yes it is a good album, however to compare it with \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" does not work for me as I consider Beatles to be far superior. Even Rolling Stones has made better albums then this. However, do not get me wrong this is a good album, but not as good as many would have you believe. The booklet is very nice with many photographs, liner notes written by Brian Wilson and David Leaf. No lyrics are included but we get a list of whom plays what on each track. 4/5.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is an excellent work out video.  Its short but gets the heart rate up.  I think it's perfect for people who don't have a lot of time but who want to get rid of those excess calories.  I don't have to spend an hour or more at the gym.  In 20 minutes I get more of a workout than an hour at the gym.
B001SO69IY|5.0|Ok, so the original blackout album was 5 stars, #2 is 4.5! why the half star difference, cause the first album was all about..well... Doc & Mef. The second album albeit excellent has one too many cameos. Nonetheless this album is highly entertaining! and props go to Redman; judging by his current albums, his game at age 39 is top rate!
B001TH16DS|5.0|Restoration near perfect quality i like the ability to view both enhanced and original effects. Lots of special features. Great for any fan of the show.
0385340575|4.0|How do you dare put a book down when by page 2 the main character (Jack Reacher, of course) spots a woman who appears to be a suicide bomber on a subway train. She sits in a black heavy coat mumbling to herself. Reacher knows something is wrong. He lists the criterion for suicide bombers. Reacher knows after he goes through the list that he is dealing with a very dangerous situation. What will Reacher do?    Lee Child writes a fast paced book, of course, and this one does not fail to explode out of the gates and never slows down. Reacher has to deal with the NYC Cops, the Feds, Dept of Defense and possibly even the Taliban or Al Qaeda who have possibly infiltrated the city of New York.     The plot moves quickly and I found myself turning the pages in total enjoyment. The only problem I had with the plot was the \\"memory stick\\" which had a good premise (what was on that memory stick?), but it seemed to fade out of importance near the end and I thought Lee Child could have done more with that issue.     Still, it's a great read and Jack Reacher fans can rejoice as he is back and better than ever!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This show changed me for the better, no wait, it changed me for good. I guarantee anyone that goes in and sees that show will find something that they can connect to with Elphaba. For years I was afraid to watch The Wizard of Oz because of the witch. Now after learning her story, she's become like a best friend to me, even though she's fictional. I see so much of myself in her. The music is so powerful and inspiring and it made me a fan of Stephan Schwartz, Joe Mantello, Idina Menzel, Kristin Chenoweth and really a lot of other people. It made me a fan of Broadway in general too. Seriously, if you have not seen this show yet, GO! I'm looking forward to seeing it for the fifth time on my birthday in August!
1416550542|4.0|Kate Morton has given us a modern day mystery with heavy overtones of Dickens in this epic multi-generational saga.  The constant switching between 1913, 1975, and 2005 is not as confusing as it may sound and the reader soon becomes inextricably linked to Eliza, Nell, and Cassandra and easily adapts to the time-frame of each character.<br /><br />The mystery of Nell's parentage permeates the novel and, as she is dying in her 90's, we are transported back to her story which began at age 4 when she was abandoned on a ship sailing from England to Australia.  Her granddaughter, Cassandra, is charged with learning the details of the abandonment, a mystery Nell herself was close to solving but had to abandon in 1975.<br /><br />The story of young Eliza Makepeace is at the heart of this tale.  Eliza grows up in a rag and bottle shop reminiscent of Dickens' most compelling novels.  Her eleventh hour rescue from the workhouse and adoption by one of England's most socially prominent families is pure fairy tale, much like the fairy tales she writes and Morton intersperses into this novel for enchantment and foreshadowing.<br /><br />The reader will come to love/hate the characters of Rose (a latter day Lady Shalott) and Lady Adeline Mountrachet (Cinderella's stepmother?) as well as the underdeveloped male characters such as the perplexing Nathaniel, the ever-creepy Linus, and Chris, the doctor-cum-gardener.  The female characters are definitely more developed and the lack of definement with the males, particularly with Nathaniel, left this reader wanting more of his story.<br /><br />Solving the mystery will keep you turning the pages and long after you think you have solved the puzzle, new details will make you rethink your solution.  All in all, an interesting tale told in multiple time frames with women linked by their resourcefulness and need for identity.

B000I2JDEY|5.0|This has got to be the best portrayal of a difficult marriage that has ever hit the screen.  It is so real, so intelligent, so funny, and so pathetic that it is worth viewing at every period of one's life.  Nothing portrays the complexity of living together in disharmony as this film does.  They hate eachother, they love eachother, they find themselves stuck in realities and games of their own making, to the awestruck horror of their young guests who appear to be on the same path.<br /><br />You have Martha, who is spoiled, self-destructive, an alcohol abuser, and lover.  At lucid moments, fuelled by alcohol, she gets glimpses into what she is doing to their marriage.  She reproaches herself, yet plays the game with relentless cruelty and energy.  George appears hapless, stuck in a career that dooms him to mediocrity and scorn by the woman he continues to love and despise.  But he is smart and witty and devious.  Underneath, there appears (at least to me) to be much that is good in both of them, but it is submerged in their frustration at stalled lives.<br /><br />As a young student, I saw this and was horrified.  Why don't they divorce?  That is the natural question.  Isn't it over, given the horror on display with such nakedness in front of their naive guests?  Then, in middle age, you can recognize what you have seen in so many couples:  the rage at personal limits and perhaps fate, turned on the partner as blame, yet the core of caring still intact in unguarded moments.  They operate within boundaries of their own devising, but even these no longer work for some reason.  SOmething has changed, some vital turning point reached or breached.  Is it broken, the end?  Or is it an indication of some new way forward?  My reading of the film is that it is ambiguous and up to them - just like in real life.  If there anything positive left?  Or will they kill eachother?<br /><br />If you can take it, this is an utterly mesmerizing film, so real in its portrayal of living dysfunction that its power cannot be denied.  While my own marriage never reached such a depth of enmity and emotional violence, it is a place that any realist should fear to tread.  After all, you never understand how easy marriage was until it no longer works.<br /><br />REcommended with enthusiasm for those who have the courage to look reality in the face.dysfunction that its power cannot be denied.

0316044695|5.0|I have read a few war on terror related stories like One Bullet Away, House to House and by far Lone Survivor has been the best of them all. It's told in a patriotic and country loving tone and the story itself is very exciting. Makes for great reading! Highly recommended 5/5
B0000C3I6U|5.0|There are other reviews detailing summaries of this incredible documentary and the mind games and raw emotion in the film.  I am going to write that anyone who weight trains, a few days a week as a hobby to split training 6 days a week as a job, this movie is a must have.  After watching a few minutes of some of the greatest, most well known bodybuilders of the 70's, you will want to literally pull your car out of its parking spot (like Franco Columbu in this movie) and head straight for the gym.  On those \\"lazy\\" days that everyone has, when I don't really \\"feel\\" like going to the gym or giving it my all, I throw this in and slap the lazy out of myself.      This is a great documentary about the sport and the personalities that helped make it.  It shows Arnold's charisma and not that he is a dumb ox, or Oak rather.  But if I had to sum up how I felt about this movie in one word, it would be Inspiration.
B002962RKE|5.0|The music--fabulous. The acting--great. The theme--the best. Will be watching and waiting for more. Turning away from the almighty dollar to do what makes one truly happy is more than a goal: It is inspiration.

B001PPLIEG|2.0|Being a James Bond fan, I was very disappointed with the editing, and  lack of directing to develop a concrete thriller that James Bond movies normally provide.  Scenes would cut mid sentence, then a blow-up scene,  then back to another 10 second conversation, then another action scene.  It lacked credibility, and seemed bent on minute to minute blow-up action  scenes that didn't make any sense.     I should have saved my money, and watched it at the $2 theater instead.

B00097DX3U|4.0|Liked more songs than I didn't.  Not as good as self titled cd: Audioslave.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|Well! Now that I've finally seen it, I can comment: Brilliant!  I think my favourite aspect of this film is the fact that it doesn't in ANY way detract from what has come before. Does it rewrite the entire history of the franchise? Yes. Does it irrevocably alter characters that we have come to know and love? Yup. Does it take cheap shots at the original shows for laughs? You betcha. And does it do all of this with reverence and grace, without sacrificing the dignity of a 42 year old legend? Absolutely!  I'll admit that I was very worried. As updates go, this one wasn't really necessary. The beauty of the Star Trek universe is that it really is big enough to tell whatever stories one would like. It doesn't have to be about Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the U.S.S. Enterprise. For examples, see any of the countless books and comic books that have valiantly carried the franchise along while its presence has been lacking from television airewaves. So when I heard that this film would be revamping the series from the beginning, I had visions of a television hack (non other than the creator of \\"Lost,\\" \\"Alias\\" and, ahem, \\"Felicity\\"?!?, J.J. Abrams) reinventing the wheel for lack of better ideas. Boy, was I wrong!  This story lovingly recreates the Star Trek universe from scratch, choosing the best elements of the original series, trimming away what no longer really works and retooling only the elements that were outdated. There are plenty of new ideas and in-jokes for fans of the original series while introducing Gene Roddenberry's wonderful vision of the future to a whole new generation. The action and excitement will leave you breathless on the edge of your seat. But the plot is clever, thoughtful, detailed and intelligent. Cliched as it may sound, there really is something here for everyone.  Rather than insulting Gene Roddenberry's genius vision, this film demonstrates that the original ideas behind Star Trek are just as valid today as they were in 1967. Then, as today, our world stood in conflict, chaos and bloodshed. But this vision of the future is one in which people of differing races, cultures, and even species work and live together to face the challenges that lie ahead. Star Trek once again points the way to a better, brighter tomorrow.
B000VBP382|5.0|Wonderful movie that brings the story and family into a contemporary audience. I remember watching the first 20 minets of this film and thinking I wanted to go and live with the Bennet family. This is my favorite movie. Joe Wright got it all right.
0307269752|5.0|Come one come all!  Every Mystery/Thriller genre reader cannot afford to let Stieg Larsson's novel \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" pass you by.  Larsson died in 2004 but not before handing in his three manuscripts - a trilogy you can not afford to miss.  I let this book sit in my To Be Read (TBR) file too long from its initial release date of 9.16.08.  I cannot say enough about the book other than it is a MUST read for all of us who love our Mysteries and Thrillers.

B0009WFEK0|5.0|Pretty cool stuff - I would say a definite 5 star in its class.  Not the kind of stuff I would listen to every day but still great stuff.  Nice beat.  I love stuff with a strong heavy beat.  I can do some serious dancing to this stuff or blast it while driving, or play it on the drums.  This stuff is \\"in the groove!\\"  It can also be party music--where you want the party to be lively.  2 CDs from 2005.  Cool techno sounds woven into the music, too.  I could do without the singing, but I won't hold it against the group. Saying the same words over and over again has no purpose, but the beat and techno more than makes up for the mindless verbal blather.  (Many people like the verbal blather though.)  Many of these songs are of sufficient length, too, again, making them great for listening or dancing.  I hate it when I just get on the floor and get moving and the song is over.  Fortunately, most DJs will at least mix  a couple of songs together.  Anyway, as you can see below, many are extended length.  There is nothing distinctive I can say about each but they are all really cool and all the same type of music and beat.  They bring out the ANIMAL in me! R-O-A-R!!!  My son loves the album, too.  I loaded it on my PC and ipod so I get to hear it now and then because he keeps \\"borrowing\\" my CD.  About 100 minutes worth of music total in 16 tracks, so if you have only one CD hole in your car, this one will play for almost 1 ¾ hours without having to change it or listen to repeats.

B001PPGAIA|3.0|Understanding \\"epic\\" to be a story that celebrates heroic feats in a way that is not necessarily factual, it is a perfect descriptor for Australia.  Bigger than life in some respects, much smaller in others,  the story of the Stolen Generation is an important one and deserves better telling than it got here. Hugh Jackman was excellent while Nicole Kidman rarely came across as more than an actress with insufficient emotional investment in the role.  Not a blow out but a movie that definitely did not live up to the hype.

B00005JKGO|3.0|I won't attempt to outdo the first rate reviews of \\"La Vita Dolce\\" that are already posted here (except to say that a film about shallow, meaningless lives in 1960s Italian society sounded like the last thing I wanted to watch until I bore witness to it and was in tears by the end), but I feel it necessary to comment upon the unusual and disappointing choice of features attached to this 2 Disc Collector's edition.<br /><br />One would imagine that a two disc set (one of them entirely devoted to supplemental materials) would contain everything you ever wanted to know about this staggering, bewildering monument of a film.  I had so many questions when the film ended, as well as so many mental notes to compare against the authoritative opinions of a supplemental documentary, but none were to be found.  While the second disc contains a number of features that wax nostalgic for the film's actors and (most prominently) it's director, there is absolutely no supplemental information about the film itself, aside from an insultingly light introduction to the film given by a man who outright admits to know very little about Fellini.  Even the optional audio commentary to the film was frustratingly deficient, failing to apply any insight beyond the obvious at too many critical points in the film.<br /><br />A film like this one deserves more -- even just an audio track of a critical essay written on the film while stills are displayed on the screen.  A 2 Disc Collector's Edition suggests a full and well rounded collection of supplemental features, but I doubt anyone other than completest Fellini fanatics will find much value in the supplemental features here.  Where's Criterion when you need them?
B000FC11A6|4.0|The author has a unique writing style; often dispensing background information in pithy and vulgar many-page rant-lets. Highly enjoyable as long as you don't mind some gruffness.     Virtually all characters have humorous elements, but with equal depth. The plot is advanced via at least three different threads in alternating chapters. To the authors credit, all of the threads are engaging.    Computer science content is remarkably plausible (read: well researched and presented by an expert), with almost no hand-waving. Can't comment on same for historical accuracy.
B001FB55HG|3.0|Hollywood has a habit of rebooting successful franchises, and it seems like the next one on the list is James Cameron's \\"Terminator\\" franchise. I have always wondered how the futuristic apocalyptic world of this sci-fi franchise would look like and as to how humans are able to survive and keep a \\"resistance\\". Having the rare distinction of being both a prequel and a sequel, \\"TERMINATOR SALVATION\\" attempts to give us that vision. The film pretty much takes off after where Jonathan Mostow's underappreciated \\"Rise of the Machines\\" and takes place many years after Cameron's original.<br /><br />2018. John Connor (Christian Bale) is an tired soldier in a war against the killing machine-hordes of Skynet. Using tapes left behind by his deceased mother Sarah Connor (voiced by Linda Hamilton), he tries to piece together clues to their future and how everything is tied to the past. Some people see John as some prophet, and he has managed to gain the confidence of many soldiers, including a teenager named John Reese (Anton Yelchin) who is also John's father. After a skirmish between the resistance fighters and machines in a desolate area, a man named Marcus (Sam Worthington) is freed. He was a ruthless killer executed sometime ago, and who has now regained consciousness. Wandering in the wasteland which was formerly L.A., Marcus befriends Kyle who points him to the direction of the resistance movement. Kyle becomes captured and marked for execution, as Marcus meets John Connor. But Marcus is a lot more than he seems to be, and the fate of humanity is now at risk.<br /><br />The Terminator franchise is a series that is essentially an action-packed chase film that was thrilling, and manages to expose the heart of human drama in the face of a potentially horrific future. It was brilliantly simple, its creator James Cameron and then director Jonathan Mostow's renditions carried the same scent and mechanics. Well, this time around, director McG, is a odd choice since his less than impressive resume includes the abysmal \\"Charlie's Angels\\". The world of 2018, is not too much to be understood as it is to be experienced. \\"Terminator Salvation\\" chronicles man's fight for survival ruled by machines and intelligent computers. The direction is very uneven and presents a lot of inconsistencies in its existing groundwork. What's more, the film relies on the impression that whoever would be watching this film is a fan, as it abandons a lot of characterization.<br /><br />The moody and brooding monochromatic world of \\"Salvation\\", is something different from Cameron's set groundwork of night executed guerilla warfare, where humans are left in the underground on the brink of extinction. Keep in mind that this film occurs in the early days of the resistance (the early models of the T-600) and this time around, there are quite a good number of survivors in this dried up barren world. The screenplay by John Brancato and Michael Ferris is very inconsistent and proves to be a little too hollow. (Not surprising, since these two are responsible for \\"Catwoman\\") The script introduces certain aspects, that seem quite viable but then abandoned. The script felt a little too rushed and lacked a careful methodical approach. It seemed like they were relying on the audience to fill in the plot gaps, such as why the machines were taking prisoners, or as to how the resistance seem to be well-supplied in armament and provisions--they have aircraft and submarines. It would have been easy to give subtle hints that humans are needed as slaves to maintain the machines or to use their organic skin for the newer T-800 models, and that the supplies were stolen, that there were military lines of communication left in the world; But none of these were brought into exposition. I thought Cameron's world gave the impression that humanity was all but wiped out, with very few survivors. The direction relies on the audiences to find explanations, and leaves us to our assumptions. A littleeffort in plot details and characterization would've helped. The direction exhibited ignorance to this successful sci-fi franchise.<br /><br />The film is also promoted as a film about John Connor but it carried a more steady diet on Marcus and even borrows elements from \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" and maybe even the \\"Matrix\\". The concept of what makes a human is quite interesting, but it was a little unnecessary. Marcus was human to begin with, despite his alterations to machine parts. He has his own organic parts, and still has the human essentials. The idea of him becoming a `sleeper' terminator carries little merit as a machine who thinks himself human. In this installment, the machines have risen to the point as being more interesting than their human counterparts. What's more, McG never fleshes out the idea of the duality of man and machine, the potential combustive merging of man and machine, Marcus' character would've been interesting if guided by more competent direction. Bale takes a backseat to Worthington and the Connor character was almost left with nothing but to play a supporting role. The cast is a little uneven, but I cannot really blame them given the small things they had to work with. I was real pleased to see Moon Bloodgood, she was a sight for sore eyes.<br /><br />Amid all the plot mistakes and blunders, McG attempts to flood our minds with explosions and very cool scenes of battle. Yes, the film does have a good number of  \\"Man Vs. Machine\\" confrontations. The machines this time around looked very inventive, as to how they mimic common military strategies and firepower. There are terminator motorbikes (idea probably taken from \\"Robotech\\"), a huge tank-like robot ( which looked like a refugee from Michael Bay`s \\"Transformers\\"), a carrier aircraft, and we see glimpses of the T-600, the slow earlier generation terminator. Oh, we also get to see the newer generation T-800 and a CGI-generated \\"Anuld\\" makes a short appearance. The battle scenes are cool to watch but they are hardly epic, since they are too short and barely carried any emotional impact. Still, the action sequences were thrilling enough and may be enough to give the movie hyper-kinetic momentum, to compensate for the clumsy storytelling.<br /><br />Now, is \\"Terminator Salvation\\" worthy of a nod from Cameron? Well, probably not. The film's storytelling is clumsy and uninspired, the film doesn't carry the same metal scent in the other previous films of the franchise. But for a fan of the franchise as I am, I was willing to forgive its shortcomings. At least the franchise is given new life, since I am very disappointed that \\"Terminator: Sarah Connor Chronicles\\" was recently confirmed as cancelled.<br /><br />Recommended! very timidly.

B001FB55HG|2.0|Terminator: Salvation was disappointing. It seemed liked everything was worn out,the robots the humans. The weapons were standard like we have now where were the lasers they had in the other T's? Christain Bale seemed angry throughout the whole movie like, is it over yet? The cyborg, Marcus showed more emotion than John Conner. Yes, I did go for the action but, it would have help to have a better storyline. The metal sounds seemed too loud, music did not fit the movie. If they make a next one, maybe it will be better.
B000001GPX|5.0|These are great performances and a great buy. The 5th is tense, dramatic, mesmerizing, majestic. The first movement is so full of drive and tension, it commands attention from beginning to end. It is fast, but so full of body and precision that it feels perfect. Musicologists and music lovers like to ponder the sense of inevitability in music: That every note, phrase, line of music is perfectly worked out in an inevitable progression. The 1st movement of Beethoven's 5th is usually cited as the greatest example of inevitability in music and to my senses Kleiber's Beethoven 5th supports this notion very well. The 2nd movement is warm and fluid, overflowing with feeling. The strings are lush and the woodwinds poignant. Phrasing is superb and the classic Vienna timbre is evident. This is the perfect counterpoint to the opening. The 3rd is buzzing with energy and detail, then magically subsides into quiet mystery and tension. You know something big is coming! The way the 3rd movement leads into the finale is perfectly judged and to my ears has never been equaled on record. Kleiber stretches it to the breaking point and then...goosebumps! This transition again brings the idea of inevitability to the forefront and what comes after is pure glory: The brilliant brass; the tuneful, singing woodwinds; the famous VPO strings. They're all there in force to the end. This is truly epic!    The 7th is also a collectors item. Kleiber combines a delicacy of articulation with a full bodied drive that is unique. Usually it's either one or the other: A clearly phrased rendition without much weight or a thickly textured giant. Kleiber finds the ideal balance between the fine details and driving rhythms in such a way that the end result is both full-bodied and transparent.    If you are interested in this CD definitely go for Deutsche Grammophon's \\"The Originals\\" edition rather than the first CD versions (separate for each symphony) from the 1980s. The earlier versions, especially the 5th, have a severe harshness that has been removed with the new remastering. I can't comment on the SACD or DVD Audio versions.
B00004RJ71|3.0|Bound by Honor (1993), appears to have been inspired from a book,  that the director has faithfully transposed onto the silver  screen.    It's a valuable DVD rental for those interested in the urban  culture of the USA (particularly, in Los Angeles and Latinos back  in the 1970's.)    Considering the length of the film (3 hours), the visual quality  (although not wide-screen) takes on special significance, and  this is the  case here, showing outstanding talent in the  selection of various scenes in and around LA, in homes, barrios,  streets, and more, such that, the story is flawless in  representing all places where the actual story develops and  forms, upto and including showing a pentitentiary in its many  aspects. The importance of realism cannot be over-emphasized in a  movie dealing with this type of subject.    At the same time, the work is also another milestone in  documenting gang lifestyles, namely,  its origins and the  mentalities of those belonging and taking part in it.    The acting talent is also spotless, in particular  Benjamin Bratt  (as  Paco, a US Marine and later DEA agent), and Jesse Borrego  (as Cruz, a graffiti artist, and  painter). To a lesser degree,  Damian Chapa  (as Miklo, a gangster) puts in a good effort, while  also being a bit of an oddball in the casting. His perception is  shown, as battling being of mixed-origins, only half-Latino  having to be twice as extreme to be accepted by his peers in the  gang subculture.      The movie is educational, showing the uphill struggle of those  desiring to leave the penal system, once brought into it,  considering that the outside world (as well as the inside one) is  not black and white, but different shades of grey, as many  partake in gambling, the bookie business, sex rackets, gang  violence, abuse, physical threats, etc.    The script seems well articulated, with a fair bit of slang and  jargon from the subculture (\\"Don't mad dog me!\\" or \\"Carnal!\\" -  bro, etc.)    The name of the movie, is perhaps a misnomer, as the gang members  are compelled to stand in solidarity with each other, over a  period of years, from a feeling of identity and common origins,  and not necessarily for satisfying a requirement of honor.  Indeed, the essence of this movie is about how people change, to  survive economically, realistically, and socially over a period  of years from youth to well into their adulthood, measuring that  change against a non-changing gang oath.    Particular effort was made into making the scenes stylish and  visually appealing: a Fedora hat, coupled with a white interior  shirt, or a muscle shirt being the gang uniform.    The movie has plenty of action, with street chases, wreckless  driving in streets spectacularly laid out, as well as man-to-man  combats, pistol firefights, and more.    The hardships behind bars are not left out, showing the pressures  felt, gang authority exerted , the outcome of limitated access to  help, freedom and resources in realizing one's natural potential,  or even, access to certain foods and dishes. It also suggests  payoffs occur behind the scenes which can explain a lot.    With merit, the story reminds viewers that, if there are sellers  of substances, it exists stems from a significant consumer-side  in the USA, meaning, a supply is setup, very profitably, to meet  the demand, with the resulting competition, double-crosses,  strategic take-outs of rivals, etc.    In sum, this is a long, visual movie, that will captivate the  audience, holds their interest and takes them on an impeccable  autobiographical tale from childhood in the barrio to adulthood,  with a number of hardships, struggles and successes.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I won't be trying to fool anyone; there's a lot of boring musicals out there.  This, however, is not one of them; this is in fact one of the most interesting and gripping musicals I know. The vocal performances are overall great, with Idina Menzel shining, while the music itself is even stronger! Not every musical can stand for itself without the screenplay, but this one is good as a music album as well as a show.    Highly recommended!

B001AVEJ1Y|4.0|I thought this was a great movie with a weak plot (I know that sounds contradictory). The film had  great acting, character development, special effects, etc. - perhaps the best of any Trek film. I loved the way the film tied together the main TOS characters.     On the other hand, I thought the plot was a bit too  grandiose - especially for a 2-hour film. I won't reveal any spoilers, but I will say a lot changed in the Star Trek universe - yet, it seemed way too quick. I'm not a Trek purist, but I just felt like the whole \\"villain develops planet-destroying technology\\" plot has been done a bit too much (e.g., Wrath of Khan, Generations, Insurrection, Nemesis) that the actual storyline seemed mundane. However, the character development and the chance to see Kirk, Spock, and Bones on the big screen more than compensated.    Trek purists beware!
1423113497|5.0|This is really a second-hand review. I purchased this series for someone else as a gift. He called to tell me how much he enjoyed the books. He has read books 1-4 and will get the remainder of the series.

B001R3YRFS|4.0|Had been hoping for this title to hit Blu since the start as there is so much to preserve here, and in the end - it has been bittersweet. I am a big fan of the film, am happy to see it on Blu, but there are so many missteps by Warner here I couldn't in good conscience give this five stars.<br /><br />Picture: The remaster looks good on Blu. That yellow lens provides a nice richness to the urban sprawl in hidef. The clarity, other colors and panoramas look cleaned up, and there is only a sparse artifact depending on the scene.<br /><br />Sound: The old 2.0 - yech.<br /><br />Special Features:<br /><br />Commentary: I am so split on this one. The packaging and online listings show a commentary by \\"Michael Douglas and Director Joel Schumacher\\". In actuality - that is furthest from the truth. The track actually has Edie Roe Smith (writer), Paul Hirsch (editor), Michael Paul Chan (actor), a 1993 recording of Michael Douglas, and a non-scene specific rambling by Joel. Once this unknown dude starts the track with this lame introduction - I knew we were in trouble. All of the recordings were obviously done at different locations and are sometimes not scene-specific. But, the tidbits of great information from the creators make for a commentary you will want to hear.<br /><br />Conversation with Michael Douglas: (10 minutes) Would have almost wanted to hear this in the commentary instead. They do an updated interview but splice in all of these degraded film shots of the movie. It was distracting but at the same time was nice to see MD come back for a talk.<br /><br />The Book/Cover Art: Warner did that glued-on paper leaflet thing again. I already tore it off and the resulting picture of Douglas with film credits is much nicer. The book is nice, but the essay is more of an ad plug than anything at the Criterion level of intellectual worthiness. The only page I found worthy out of the twenty is the trivia page of five fun facts, which were mostly already known.<br /><br />The Menu: Does not exist in the normal form. The movie auto plays so you have to stop it to get to what they have for a main menu - which looks like a supplemental page. Probably one of the worst Blu menus I have seen. Not a deal breaker, but just adds to the feel that Warner did not put the effort into the packaging/logistics part of this product.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with having it for my customers. The special features appear to be the same between the Deluxe Edition and this one. Since there are no upgrades to sound mixing, no updated commentary by Douglas, unfavorable packaging and presentation, and some mislabeling I could only give this four stars.plays so you have to stop it to get to what they have for a main menu - which looks like a supplemental page.

B000FC10MU|2.0|I actually hated this book, although I did read it all the way through.  Gaiman seems like a Stephen King wannabe without the sense of humor.
B000006OS2|4.0|This movie is probably going to offend many people with today's sensibilities. It's one of those Taming of the Shrew storylines where the shockingly independent woman has to be tamed by her man to be the perfect, obedient, wife. Normally, I'm not a huge fan of these kinds of movies, since usually the man is a total cad and the woman has all rights to resist him, but he bends her to his manly will in the end and she suddenly has all the personality of a dead carp.<br /><br />McLintock is a bit like that, I admit. But it's John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara who are always AMAZING together! And it's an Old West story that John Wayne always did so well! And I find it generally fun and silly. You just have to leave modern sensibilities at the door. For something similar with considerably less spanking (yes, spanking. With a coal scoop) you might try looking into \\"The Quiet Man\\" where he also stars with Maureen O'Hara and it's a fairly similar Taming of the Shrew story.<br /><br />My copy of the DVD came in excellent condition and played extremely well.

B001IMFHVG|5.0|This one really lives up to its name.  Rubinstein returned to Russia in 1964 for the first time in half a century.  I don't imagine anyone in the audience was disappointed by this Moscow recital (all-Chopin, except for the encores).  Since all of these works are Rubinstein staples, it's hardly necessary to discuiss them individually, except to say that he is in excellent form throughout.  A few notes, however.  The sound on the DVD is quite good (until the encores, that is, when the sound deteriorates somewhat), capturing R's famous \\"golden tone\\" at least as well as most of his studio recordings.  Visually, the DVD is a bit fuzzy (as is to be expected), but the camera work is superlative, leaving viewers plenty of time to watch R in action from various angles (without distracting us with constant shifts).  And Rubinstein is a marvel to behold, his spine at right angles to the keyboard, rarely bending toward the piano, but rising slightly from the bench to create shoulder weight and lifting his hands practically to the top of his head to create visual excitement at the end of the Heroic Polonaise.    One other note:  Rubinstein seems to want to play the four movements of the Chopin Second Sonata without pauses, as a kind of fantasy-sonata, but the audience starts to applaud after his powerful performance of the first movement.  R, impatient to contuinue, shakes his head, and people quickly stop applauding, but he seems somewat distracted.  The only careless playing in the recital comes in the first half of the scherzo, where he throws some notes around, seems to me to forget if he's already played the second repeat, and has a memory lapse just before the trio.  It seems to me he just got distracted.  A final thing to marvel at:  Runinstein's stamina.  He was 77 at the time and played a long and very taxing program.  But at the end of it, he looks like he's ready to do it all over again!  Don't miss this one.

B001FB55HG|3.0|The first Terminator movie, released twenty-five years ago (!), was a brooding masterpiece of hopeful nihilism.  T2 provided powerful lessons in empowerment and introduced a kinder, gentler Terminator, one more appropriate for a future Governator.  T3 was more of the same and successfully teed up potential story avenues for multiple interesting characters.  The latest chapter, Terminator Salvation, drops the ball.    Like the latest Star Trek movie, T4 is an origin story and in this one, set in the year 2018, we have for the first time, a prolonged look at an adult John Connor and get to see how he meets the incomparable Resistance fighter, Kyle Reese, the hero of the original film.  And therein lies the problem with Terminator Salvation.    Because Reese eventually is ordered by John Conner to go back in time to ensure his mother's survival, and thus the birth of John Conner who eventually defeats Skynet, we know that ultimately Conner and Reese have to make it through the travails of the current chapter.  We know they are in no real danger.    The new Star Trek prequel somewhat got around this dilemma by delivering constant dollops of focus on the main characters (and by placing the action in a parallel universe).  However, T4 effectively abandons the intense interpersonal human drama and watertight logic of its predecessor movies.  In fact, even cursory scrutiny leads one to believe that in the next ten years humankind will know how to subsist despite no visible means of agriculture, produce an unlimited supply of ammunition for automatic weapons and be able to surgically transplant vital organs without such complicating factors as the need for matching blood types or a sterile operating environment.    The cast does as good a job as was possible with the material.  Connor is played by Christian Bale, who ably reflects the literally world-weary Resistance leader.  Anton Yelchin, who plays Reese, pretty much steals every scene in which he appears.  And although Blood Moongood (are you serious?) is fetching as the winsome Blair, her fairly whiny presence as the only major female character only underscores how much the series has veered from T1 & T2 director James Cameron's penchant for strong female protagonists.  After the first two movies, I felt like I knew Sarah Connor, and, uh, Blair is no Sarah Connor.    One of the two most interesting aspects of the film is in the character of Marcus Wright, played by Australian actor Sam Worthington.  To continue with the parallels to Star Trek, Marcus is a red shirt.  In other words, when the leading characters on the enterprise beamed into hostile territory, we knew none of them would suffer mortal danger, so to show that the aliens were Really Bad People who could do Really Bad Things, a crew member who wore a red shirt usually bit the dust.  In an irony introduced midway through the movie, Worthington's character ends up being the most human of all.    The other high point is in the special effects. The visuals in T4 are stunning.  This world of Skynet is filled with original Terminator models for as far as the eye can see, liquid metal Terminators and Trojan Horse Terminators that release Motorcycle Terminators.  There are even mammoth Jurassic Park Terminators capable of snatching up hapless Resistance fighters in their huge grasping fists.  In a continuous CGI-generated shot lasting several minutes toward the beginning, we follow John Connor as he takes over a helicopter, flies it into the air, then ultimately crash lands.  By the end of the exhilarating sequence, my head felt like one of the trademark crushed human skulls present in every one of the movies.  Gone are the days of shoestring-budget effects and multiple crushed AMC Gremlins.    Unfortunately the trend of the Terminator movies has been to progressively move toward the Holy Grail of Big Budget Special Effects and away from well-told and soul-stirring science fiction, which, at its best, explores the pesky troublesthat result from humans being ourselves and then being forced to solve our moral dilemmas which are inevitably of our own making.    On a perhaps not totally conscious level, we respond to the Terminator movies because we recognize our times.  The original movie tapped into Cold War dread and fear over the formidable reach of the Evil Empire.  T2 was right for an optimistic time of glasnost.  The third installment fit into the current age of terrorism, with an \\"the enemy was within\\" denouement.  The message of the latest is, I don't know...Skynet could afford massive armaments by leveraging L.A. real estate?    Watching Terminator Salvation is a lot like riding a roller coaster ride: thrilling while it's going on, but over when it's over.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, however, intricate battle scenes and mind-blowing spectacle can't replace basic concern for characters.  In the end I wasn't allowed to care nearly as much as I wanted to.    Admittedly, the bar is high, but that's why movie makers earn the big bucks.  Hopefully next time there's no \\"MCG\\" turning the franchise into fast food \\"McTerminator\\" movies.  We fans can only hope that when the Terminator installment next comes back, it is more Harlan Ellison and less Harley Davidson.    Grade: C        Some of Dreamer Action Figure's other scribblings can be found on My Space.  \\"Terminator Salvation: Rise of the Deus Ex Machina\\" was originally titled, \\"Salvation from the Trend in the Terminator Movies, Please\\" and was written after reading a couple of reviews of other films written by a friend in his local newspaper.  It's become something of a tradition for me and one of my brothers to see the latest Terminator movie on the day it comes out.  I suspected something was afoot when we arrived more than thirty minutes early in anticipation of the crowd and walked into a totally empty theater.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Unbelievable!  This movie has everything even for those who know nothing about Star Trek or had very little interest in the original series.  There were happy moments, sad moments and lots of action in between.  It is by far one of the best science fiction movies I have ever seen.  The actors did excellent jobs representing their characters and I am looking very forward to any and all seqeuels.<br /><br />Star Trek was made by the creators of Lost which is also my favorite TV show.  If the Star Trek Blu-Ray is anything like the Lost DVDs and Blu-Rays then it should be packed with lots and lots of extras.  I can't wait!!  I don't even have a blu-ray player or HDTV but will have one when this movie comes out to buy.  I will be the first in line!

B001EAWMGA|5.0|I first started noticing information on the film Outlander about a year ago on various Science Fiction sites and began to track it until it's recent DVD release on Amazon.   Apparently something happened causing theatre display that was extremely limited in both Europe and the United States crippling the commercial release of this excellent product. This film has a well written unique plot that works--Aliens---swords---Vikings!! The photography, locations, plot line and Computer Generation are all first rate. James Caviezel displays a particular alien quality which is very,very believable...I believe that the very few flat spots in the film could easily be fixed by a directors cut edition---I would have enjoyed seeing more of Caviezel's retractable body armor and more of the most excellent Ron Pearlman in the film but you cannot have everything....Outlander as it stands is one of the best SF movies I have seen in a long time..I enjoy hunting quality, relatively unknown SF dvd releases such as Outlander, the french SF film Chrysalis, and the upcoming Hunter Prey...Outlander however has been the best, unknown SF film, in recent memory.
B001TOD92C|5.0|The Wrestler is without a doubt the Best Movie of 2008! Witness the Resurrection of one of the Greatest Actors ever Mickey Rourke who fits his role perfectly as Randy The Ram a Wrestler from the 80's.The Story is so Human and touches the human spirit on so many levels.Ive always been a fan of Mickey and this one is his Perfect Role.I feel so many of his films were overlooked especially \\"BULLET\\" which is a fantastic film.Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood give truly amazing performances.I absoloutely loved this film in every way possible.Highly Highly Recommended to anyone who is ready to truly witness Mickey in his prime.Welcome back my friend...
B0019R7XVC|5.0|I was looking for some good old rock n' roll on Amazon when this band popped up; and let me say--WoW!! These guys rock and rock hard...I can't believe they never made it in the US and to find out that they are/have disbanded is a big disappointment.  For anyone looking to buy an awesome 'rock in ur face' CD...buy this.
B0002S943O|2.0|Fan of the band, saw them live, and enjoy a great deal of their music, but just not a fan of this show or DVD.
B00004LN16|3.0|Keeping a &#34;Stiff Upper Lip&#34; has never been a problem with AC/DC. They stayed with their meat and potatoes rock even when it wasn't fashionable, refused to tinker with the formula when their sales backslid, and continued to crank out albums of varying quality year after year. The one thing they have never done, however, is cut a bad album. &#34;Stiff Upper Lip&#34; follows in the tracks of [[ASIN:B000BC8T7I Ballbreaker]] and [[ASIN:B00009MGR6 Blow Up Your Video]]; solid and predictable, not earth-shattering, yet listenable years after.<br /><br />The title track, &#34;House Of Jazz&#34; and &#34;Safe In New York City&#34; are the best things here. You may get the feeling you've heard these all before, and you'd be right. But few bands can do this as predictably as AC/DC, and they make it sound so easy that you can forget how hot it really all is. After all, &#34;Stiff Upper Lip&#34; is Angus and Malcolm at the band's quarter century mark and it was almost 20 since Brian Johnson joined the band. That the albums maintain a consistent quality (even if they aren't masterpieces) is a testament to the band's skill.

B001SO69IY|4.0|1st I have to thank these 2 guys for their latest effort. This CD is very very good. You can just hear the amount of effort Red & Meth put into this CD. This CD is a str8 listen I don't have to skip any tracks. Quick track review:  1. BO2 - Good opening track. This is always necessary.  2. I'm Dope Ni**a - Good change of pace. Most tracks are uptempo. Not     Havoc's best but solid.  3. A-YO - Cool radio track with a catchy hook.  4. Dangerous MCees - HARD!!! Best Erick Sermon beat in a while.  5. Errbody Scream - For the clubs but it's nice and dirty. Beat is        energetic.  6. Hey Zulu - Another for the clubs. More for the ladies but still cool.  7. City Lights - For the ride  8. Father's Day - Smoothe  10. Mrs. International - Not my cup of tea.  11. How Bout Dat - Nice beat and rhymes.   12. Dis Iz 4 All My Smokers - Hmmm...I quit smoking 9 years ago and this track made me feeling lighting one up. HARD!!!!!  14. 4 Minutes to Lockdown - Beat could have been better but it's cool.  15. Neva Herd Dis B4 - It's okay  16. I Know Sumptn - I don't think so.  17. A lil Bit - Radio song.    15 total songs, 11 in my IPOD = A DAMN GOOD CD.  BUY IT!!!!
B000002O4S|3.0|Back to the Future has a very fast paced and exciting soundtrack with parts that are very haunting as well. Really enjoy the instrumentals as well as the songs by Huey Lewis and the classics like Earth Angel and Johnny B Goode.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Everything previous reviewers said is true.    If you are interested in the history of WWII, you should own this box set.    If you are interested in documentaries, you should own this box set.    If you are a fan of Laurence Olivier, who narrates the series, you should own this box set.    For me the highlight of the entire series is the episode entitled \\"Remember\\".    It is haunting and poetic.    A great example of what documentaries are capable of.
B0001I561E|5.0|The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Lion King, and Beauty and the Beast were all part of the Disney revival. Right before Pixar and the huge advances in computer animation these Disney movies have a look, character, and beauty that is hard to beat.    Aladdin follows the classic fairy tale for the most part and like the other 3 movies mentioned above the music and score are also incredible. Voice talent was well matched and the humor from Robin Williams and Gilbery Gottfried gave a spark to the movie.
B001P9KR8U|1.0|I had difficulty watching this movie, not because of violence, but editing.  In the first half, 2- 3 seconds was the max between cuts.  Someone delivery a 15 second line would have five edits before the line was delivered.  Usually this technique compensates for lack of actual content or action, making one feel there is more going on in a scene.  I guess this is popular for generation ADD.  I predict this film will end up in the dust bin of history.  I have no desire to see it again, not usually the case with a great film.  Maybe I haven't played enough video games to enjoy such a film.  I admit, my view certainly seems to be in the minority.
0792165020|4.0|This is one of those films that sends shivers down your spine. Matt Damon is a pretty good actor and seeing \\"Jason Bourne,\\" play this role and have such homo erotic and strange story tangents is just creepy.
B001ECQ6E2|3.0|***THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BLU RAY EDITION***<br /><br />After 3 tortuous years in the making and adapted from Henryk Sienkiwicz's huge book, \\"Quo Vadis\\" was unleashed on the public in early 1952 - just in time for maximum exposure at the Oscars in March. Costing a staggering $7 million dollars (a figure that even now seems extravagant), the sandals and sand epic did huge box office business in a post-war world hungry for pure escapism - and even managed to garnish eight Oscar nominations along the way. Unfortunately - 57 years later - time has not been kind to this bloated beast of a thing.<br /><br />But first to the picture quality - as the word \\"Overture\\" sits stubbornly on your screen for a few minutes, it's clear that major restoration work has been done here - and then when Robert Taylor (Marcus Vinicus) does turn up riding his chariot into the outskirts of Rome after two years of campaigns, the colour and clarity is BEAUTIFUL. It stays pretty much this way for the whole of the movie - and as you can imagine with this much money spent on it - the outdoor and indoor sets are sumptuous - the BLU RAY image revealing colour and detail everywhere you look.<br /><br />The problem for me is that the film itself - no matter how good it may look now - is a crushing bore - and if it weren't for Peter Ustinov's fabulously over-the-top turn as the loony and crass Nero, \\"Quo Vadis\\" would be unbearable. The normally lovely Deborah Kerr looks suitably bathed in Christian light and full of love for humanity as you can imagine, but I find her po-faced performance as Lygia to be tedious and strangely dead - and again as a lead, she is acted off the set by a supporting actor - the Oscar nominated Leo Genn. British born Genn plays the artful Petronius - a courtier to the harp-playing, poetry composing, grape-eating Divinity. Petronius uses intelligence and cunning to effortlessly dance around Nero's increasingly ludicrous claims and word games. He - of all the cast - feels the most real - Taylor and Kerr seem to be merely doing their jobs. \\"Quo Vadis\\" is three hours long - and for me - I felt too many instances where I wanted to reach for the fast-forward button...Ustinov and Genn kept me from doing so.<br /><br />However, for lovers of the film and period buffs, the Blu Ray purchase is a no-brainer. It looks great - and if you have a home cinema kit or better still a projector and large pull-down screen - then this will transport you back to the opulence of Fifties MGM overkill in a way that the DVD never could.<br /><br />Great to look at then - but for me - not really a great movie...rr seem to be merely doing their jobs. \\"Quo Vadis\\" is three hours long - and for me - I felt too many instances where I wanted to reach for the fast-forward button...Ustinov and Genn kept me from doing so.

B00005A8H5|1.0|Thought this was just an extended Top Gun soundtrack with \\"You've Lost that Loving Feeling,\\" \\"Great Balls O Fire,\\" etc., but turns out this is some strange Super CD format that none of my players or computers support. Never heard one track off this CD and although it is my fault for buying it and I should have returned the CD I have no idea what would play this CD. I think the entire format was dead before I ever ordered this thing.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|I use just do reviews on itunes but this release I feel needs to be expressed on here as well. This album rocks from start to finish with powering vocals and great guitar riffs. Amazingly reminds me of Heart back in the day. This is a great buy for any rock fan trust me if you are missing rock the way it used to be played Halestorm delivers all your urges.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|Top Gun made so many people want to become fighter pilots. As a movie it was probably one of the best promotional tools the Navy and armed forces ever had and the spike in enrollment for years was measurable. Of course there were very few who became pilots or even RIO's and probably ended up in crap roles and not even on an carrier, but I digress.    It's strange to look at the film now and see the outdated old Ninja motorcycle, know that F-14's are no longer in service, Top Gun itself doesn't exist, Anthony Edwards is bald, and Tom Cruise is a Scientology freak.    People also comment on the 'homo-erotic,' volley ball scene, but I prefer to think that there are many more straight women who enjoyed that one scene in a guy's film vs homosexual males.    Top Gun as a film is out dated, but it is still fun to watch and feel like I'm a little kid again who thinks that one day I could be a fighter pilot. It's a film locked in a period of time in US history that has come and gone, but it still makes me smile.
B001N26GFC|2.0|Poppy - the titular happy-go-lucky - is a 30-year-old single teacher played by Sally Hawkins.  She lives with a female friend and enjoys her single life, which includes drinking with friends in pubs and riding around on her bike.  One day, her bike is stolen, and she decides to take driving lessons instead of replacing the bike.  Enter her driving teacher, the unfriendly, overly serious Scott (Eddie Marsan).<br /><br />\\"Happy-Go-Lucky\\" received very good reviews and several Golden Globe nominations, including Best Picture Musical or Comedy.  Thus, I was expecting a light, comedic movie.  However, \\"Happy-Go-Lucky\\" is anything but a comedy.  Mike Leigh's \\"comedies\\" are often underlined with a rather morose sadness, but \\"Happy-Go-Lucky\\" takes this trend a step further.  Poppy is superficially cheerful and optimistic, but her forced cheerfulness seems to be a means of covering her inability to cope with uncomfortable situations, like a nervous laugh.  Listening to her constant giggles and snorts is extremely grating.  The driving scenes are particularly irritating, with Poppy nervously giggling and snorting nonstop and Eddie angrily yelling for Poppy to pay attention.  There are a few laughs in a segment involving an emotionally unstable flamenco dance teacher, which is quite funny but also pretty much disconnected from the rest of the film.<br /><br />As a comedy, \\"Happy-Go-Lucky\\" fails miserably.  How about as a drama then?  Well, as a drama it also falls short as the main character is so thoroughly annoying that it's hard to root for her or care about her life.  This movie, however, has obviously appealed to some audiences and critics; some people seem drawn to Poppy and her life.  I'd say that if you like Mike Leigh in general, you'll like this film much better than I did.  I don't generally like Leigh's films, aside from the superb \\"Topsy Turvy\\" (1999).  I like \\"Topsy Turvy\\" because it seems more scripted than his other works; he's famous for having only a script outline and then working with his actors to \\"improvise\\" the action.  Unfortunately, the improvisation is all too apparent here, especially with some of the supporting actors who are extremely stiff and seem as though they're acting in a different film.  I was sorely disappointed with \\"Happy-Go-Lucky\\" - the movie is amateurishly made and was really chore to wade through to the end.working with his actors to \\"improvise\\" the action.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|I've been watching for this release for some time now, but apparently it won't be coming.  I've read the \\"reviews\\" here and take them as editorials on the situation.  I think most of them are right on the money.    I think it's a sad situation when an artist who we've supported over the years gets to a point where they willing ignore the base that put them on top.    If you ever read this Mr. Lucas, please remember that everything you have, the computer you're sitting at reading this, the cup in your hand, even your kids college education came out of our pockets.  Sure it was a fair transaction, but don't forget where it came from.    It is indeed sad when the artist doesn't support the fans.
B001IXSU8M|5.0|Lady GaGa shows her supreme talent on this album. \\"The Fame\\" is one of THE best albums to come out in over a decade, period. With her supreme artistry, breath-taking vocal talent, amazing perfomances (ever read a review of her live show? She blow's 'em away Every Time), and original fashion, Lady GaGa will take over the world! If Stevie Nicks and Prince had a love-child in 1986, you'd get Lady GaGa. Lady GaGa is utterly fantastic.  \\"Pop Music Will Never Be Low-Brow\\"   I can't wait to see her live (I'm sure it'll bring me to tears, just like the first time I saw Stevie Nicks live)!!     ~Chandra aka JaidaMoon
B000UZ4G8M|3.0|Sure, it's nice to have \\"How to Save a Life\\" and \\"Song beneath the Song\\" in one place, but I wish \\"Back Where I Was\\" by John Elliott and the Hereafter were part of this compilation.
B000UO338W|5.0|If \\"The Last Sucker\\" is indeed Ministry's swan song, what a way to go.  Al Jourgenson, one of the pioneers of industrial/metal, has always been socially conscious, and especially loathing of organized religion (\\"Psalm 69\\") and the Bush era, both senior and junior.<br />  Not that the evil deeds of W. aren't worth this scathing wrath Jourgenson delivers.  Without trying to get too political myself, which, given the last three Ministry's lyrical contents is not easy, it's a glorious insightful exercise of the 1st Amendment, set to punishing brutal riffs and samples that make your skin crawl, since many of those are from the Bush man himself.<br />  What makes latter day Ministry particularly powerful is the inclusion of Prong genius Tommy Victor as a full musical writing partner and guitarist extraordinaire.  Few can pummel your cranium into soggy grits like Victor can, and his attack is as brutal as the crimes Jourgenson laments on \\"The Last Sucker\\".<br />  Favorite cuts include the title track, the Cheney slam piece \\"The Dick Song\\", which is funnier than hell, and the closer \\"End Of Days Pts. 1 and 2\\".  What makes these interesting is the inclusion of the prophetic and chilling final speech Dwight Eisenhower gave on national television before turning the office over to JFK.  In it, Eisenhower warned the public of the danger he saw emerging of the military industrial complex getting mixed up with profiteering and tipping the balance between rightful defense needs and outright military corruption.  Talk about hitting the nail on the head.<br />  We should thank Jourgenson for including all of that speech as an album closer, as he obviously wants to share a chilling moment in history with his listeners, and good for him for trying to educate us.<br />  But whether you agree with his politics or not, it's great for the music, too.  Prong and Ministry are a match made in metal heaven, or hell, whichever they prefer.
0061544493|3.0|The book wasn't what I thought it would be, but it was still enjoyable.  Kind of a 'How to' book.
006135323X|5.0|Refreshing and irreverent, Ariely actually performs experiments that evaluate questions I've had for a long time, like, why do people prefer name brands, why free is not always free, the cost of social norms (why you don't pay your mother-in-law for cooking your dinner, the effect of cultural preference for uniformity vs. individuality, this book will interest you. Ariely's experiments are clever and simple, and quite fascinating. He has an interesting story to tell about his own life, as well. When I finished this book, I mourned my loss. I very much missed my fascinating companion and all of his goofy experiments. I wanted to go out and do some experiments, too. It just seemed like a tremendous amount of fun.<br /><br />Narrated by Simon Jones, whose British accent made me think that Ariely must be British. Well, he's not, so go figure. Ariely is American, born in New York, but raised in Israel. He returned to the states to get his two Ph.D.s (cognitive psychology from Chapel Hill; business from Duke), and currently lives in the states. Simon Jones was just great, though. He did a lively and authoritative interpretation of what could have been a little dry with a lesser reader. Some British accents annoy me just about to death, they seem more interested in making sure everyone knows that they are of a higher social class than anyone but God. Not Simon Jones, though he sounds quite aristocratic, it's in the old money way, a voice that makes a person comfortable. He offers a friendly intelligence that made the reading really sparkle.<br /><br />I review only audiobooks. Check out my other reviews, then download, plug in, and never be bored again.
015603283X|5.0|I decided to get this book after watching The Ninth gate, which is based on it.  While I liked the movie, the book has a lot more detail about the various characters and fills in some blanks that were in the film.  The Club Dumas is a good story and an easy read. I went through over a 100 pages in one reading.
B0011Z51QG|5.0|I know these reviews are for the items not Amazon service, but I just wanted to include how satisfied I am with the MP3 downloads and services.  That said, Purple Rain is, in my opinion, Prince's greatest album. It isn't often that a fan can love ALL the songs on one album..a mix of songs from many albums, yes..but not every song.  I grew up in the 80's and Purple Rain just reminds me of all that I loved from that time.  The movie, Purple Rain, was okay, but I think the songs were the best part. Prince is a great artist and songwriter..I love how he mixes funk, dance and rock.
0451169514|3.0|\\"It\\" starts off so exciting with so much promise. Then the story started to drag for me and I started to get bored towards the middle and end. I had to drag myself over the finish line in this marathon of a book.      The reason for my mixed feelings is the boredom I felt reading this about halfway through and, like many others, the bizarre ending. Without giving anything away, the turtle and the part featuring Beverly and the boys near the end I just didn't get. I almost feel S. King just lost it near the end or he was reaching for something that I just didn't see. I did not find this book scary at all... I was surprised, I thought I would. I have read just a few of S. King's books, but I would put this behind \\"The Shining\\", \\"The Stand\\" and \\"The Dead Zone\\".     On a positive note, I thought \\"It\\" was original and the story as a whole a very good one. The plot and story were well developed and the characters were as real as they can get, which is what I have come to expect and enjoy from S. King. The way King ties the book together I thought was masterful.     However,in the end, \\"It\\" was a mixed-bag for me. I think I would have enjoyed it more if it was about 700 pages instead of 1100+. That is a long way to go to be a bit disappointed.

B001TH16DS|5.0|As a kid, Star Trek wasn't something that I watched all of the time. I got much more into the show via the movies. So watching this Blu-Ray and marveling at the quality and all of the extra features has made the experience a total joy. Watching Season 1 after viewing the new movie just added to the overall enjoyment. I truly appreciate the care and attention that went into remastering this jewel for the BD format.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|How pathetic is the mindset and state of our movie-making industry these days that the cleverest, most creative movie storytelling comes from the creators of animated features like this one?  It's almost as if they are the only ones who remember how to do a completely original concept, create engaging characters and witty dialogue, and a gorgeously realized world for it all to happen. So what if the Paris of \\"Ratatouille\\" is more the Paris of dreams - it's a movie, a place to spend time in, imagining that it all really does look like that, a sparkling city spread out below the rooftop of a walk-up flat with the view of the Seine. That's what movies are for, to delight, engage and entertain.<br /><br />It does help to be a bit of a foodie: as my daughter observed, upon noting  the quick throwaway bit of Chef Gusteau on the covers of certain magazines - \\"Mom, do you realize we have every one of those magazines in the house?\\" If ever there was a movie that would give you the serious munchies, this is it. Ratatouille may not the first big foodie movie, but it is definitely the first animated foodie movie, and luscious on every level. Visually, it's a feast; The Paris skyline cannot possibly look as beautiful in real life as it does here, in this tale of a young rat with dreams beyond his station in life.<br /><br />Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt) has a discriminating palate, and an unstoppable urge to be a chef, inspired by a cookbook \\"Anyone Can Cook\\" written by late five-star chef Auguste Gusteau and watching too many hours of the French version of the Food Network. When Remy and his whole rat-clan must depart their country home at speed, Remy is separated from the other rats. By chance, he finds his way through the sewers of Paris, and winds up in the holy of holies: Chef Gusteau's restaurant kitchen, now run by his none-too-ethical senior, Chef Skinner (voiced by Ian Holm).<br /><br />He teams up with the very junior Linguini (voice of Lou Romano), the garbage-boy, pot-washer and general help, desperately inept and just as desperate to keep his job. While Remy can understand Linguini and human speech in general, Linguini cannot understand him. But with practice, they work a means; Remy sits on his head and pulls at his hair; he is the chef, Linguini his means.<br /><br />This is one of those animated movies with an absolutely painterly aesthetic, as complicated and gorgeous as one of those 19th century academic visions. The restaurant kitchen where much of the action takes place is a real, tactile place, and the action is non-stop. I am left to wonder if Anthony Bourdain's Kitchen Confidential had some influence, especially with the characters of the other kitchen staff. It would have been nice to for them to have had a little more of the action, but never mind. I am sure I missed most of the sight gags, on the first time through. This is another one of those rare and lovely movie treasures like Chicken Run,  which adults and children can enjoy together... although they probably will be laughing at different things.<br /><br />Bonus features included in the DVD release unfortunately do not include either of the two trailers. One incorporated the priceless line \\"It's not too bad once you muscle past the gag reflex\\"; the endearing lament of a foodie longing after better things! Features do include the hilarious short \\"Lifted\\", a short feature hosted by Remy and his brother Emile \\"Your Friend the Rat\\",  cheerfully outlining the history of human-rat relationships, and another called \\"Fine Food and Film\\". That feature is a behind-the-scenes look at the similarities between creating fine food and fine animation; among them tireless attention to small detail and creative passion being but two of them. The deleted scenes are not really deleted, fully animated scenes, but rather animated black and white preliminary sketches of scenes that were considered, but not considered essential. All in all, well worth waiting for, and watching over and over.

B001EXE2ZQ|5.0|An enchanting real-life fairy tale, as light as a drift of marshmallow fluff, about a runaway princess and an American newspaper reporter, and their day of playing hookey in Rome; a Rome which is so thoroughly a part of this story that it might as well be one of the supporting actors. This was Audrey Hepburn's breakout movie role, and one is also charmed to learn from the extras that she was as gracious, loyal and endearing to everyone she worked with, as was  the character she played: Princess Ann, of some unspecified European country, on a state visit/good-will tour of post World War II Europe. Isolated by the requirements of her position, bored beyond tears, and chaperoned every minute of every waking day, Princess Ann impulsively flies the luxuriously gilded coop of her country's embassy in Rome late one night. She is discovered almost asleep on a park bench by reporter Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck). Being one of nature's gentlemen, he assumes she is inebriated and takes her his artistically disarranged little garret of a place; when he realizes who she is, he has plans.<br /><br />Part of the undeniable charm of this movie is the fact that it shows us a past that is nearly out of reach: a past where motor-traffic meant a flock of Vespa scooters, and a working newspaperman would never be seen not wearing a tie. It is a world which pre-dated the paparazzi, ruthlessly pursuing celebrities twenty-four seven. One could barely imagine a newspaper reporter and his photographer friend being so gallant today - even if the princess and the reporter did manage to fall into love.  A bittersweet ending; when the two almost-lovers part after their delirious, carefree glimpse of love in the shadows of the eternal city.<br /><br />Of the extras, the most interesting is \\"Rome with a Princess\\" - a modern day look at the various authentic locations used,  and a retrospective of Audrey Hepburn's career at Paramount studios.

B001FB55HG|5.0|Before I ramble on about franchises and time travel and the cool visuals of a metal humanoid trying to kill you, let me just say this: If you are a fan of Terminators, see this movie.  See it before other reviewers spoil it. GO!<br /><br />Still here?  Sigh.  This review is spoiler free, but you're bound to see something on the Internet or on television. Don't say I didn't warn you...<br /><br />One of the reasons the Terminator series is so popular is that it's a self-selecting franchise.  You either buy into the paradoxical time travel concepts or you don't, consider humanoid killer robots to be the logical evolution of warfare waged against humans or not, believe that the best choice for a killer robot to go undercover is a muscle-bound heavily-accented Austrian or just a lame vehicle for a bodybuilder-turned-actor.  In short, Terminator is more about style and less about logic. The Terminator movies have always made tough choices that are normally movie-suicide: endangering children, killing dogs, lacking a clear lead character, and blithely earning an R rating.  So by the time we reach the fourth installment of the series, it pretty clear that Terminator doesn't care much what you think about it.<br /><br />Forget time travel.  This movie takes place in a future we aren't entirely familiar with.  Forget Sarah Connor.  She is a mere shadow here, a voice on an old cassette recorder.  Forget the Schwarzenegger you knew - there are no clever robots with marketable catch-phrases.  Terminator Salvation takes place in the midst of a post-apocalyptic struggle to the death between humanity and robots, when Skynet is on the cusp of developing the flesh-shrouded Terminators we know and fear.<br /><br />There are two main characters: John Connor (Christian Bale) and Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington).  Connor is the boy we've watched grow into a man throughout the three previous films; Wright is a murderer given a second lease on life. The two share a common destiny that revolves around the survival of John's future father, the teenage Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin). The difference between the two men unifies the movie as they struggle with the crushing burden of knowledge, about themselves and their own complicated histories/futures.<br /><br />The special effects are amazing.  The action sequences take your breath away.  Terminators of all stripes from all three movies make an appearance, along with a cadre of all new clanking monstrosities. There are nods to the older films, from the way certain characters turn their heads after being punched to the music that plays on the few functioning radios.  And for the five of us fans who know that Connor is supposed to have a scar over one eye, we find out how he gets it. The director, McG, is clearly a fan and knows his material.<br /><br />If the movie has a flaw, it's that Connor isn't really necessary.  Although the entire franchise hinges on his very existence, Wright and Reese steal the show.  Bale mostly screams a lot (and if you're wondering, his recent tirade fits his character quite well) while Worthington struggles to disguise his Aussie accent.  But if you're a fan of the series and already forgiven its many paradoxes, there's nothing in Terminator Salvation that is unforgivable.<br /><br />Terminator Salvation is indeed the salvation of the franchise.

B0002Z0EYA|4.0|Troy is a EXCELLENT Movie. However, it has a big mistake. In the history, Troy was besieged for 10 years but in the movie, Troy was only besiege for nearly a month. THAT IS A BIG MISTAKE. But anyway, it's still a GEART MOVIE.
1416914307|4.0|I picked this book up after seeing that Robert Stanek recommended it. I was not disappointed. From the very first chapter I was hooked into the world of the Shadowhunters. The relationship between Clary and Jace will keep you enthralled and wanting more. But anyway, buy it. Or at least read it, borrow it from a friend. But this book is definitely buy and keep worthy.
B001FSDOZO|3.0|This album is not for everybody. It is not especially original, but if you are nostalgic for an 80s arena rock style then this very well may be worth the cost of admission for you. I would have given 3 /12 stars if I could have. And subjectively, I may have given a 4. But as much as I am one of those people who gets nostalgic I wanted to give an objective score that takes into account the fact that, true, the music here is not particularly unique or stand out as different, and the lyrics are quite frankly very trashy. This album does not break any new ground but it does improve on the 80s arena formula. The biggest influence on this album to my mind is Def Leppard. If you like them, you will probably enjoy this album. This album definitely rocks the house compared to previous Nickelback albums and for that I prefer it. Their other work was too radio-friendly and safe for me. I need edgier stuff and Nickelback delivers on that count here. If you want a throwback to, and improvement on the arena style rock, and if the \\"dumbed down\\" frat house lyrics don't bother you this album is worth another look, even if you don't like Nickelback's other albums. I didn't think I would like it and then had the opportunity to listen to the whole thing for free and was glad I had the chance. I bought it after that. It is not a \\"great\\" album but it is a good album. The older style and raunchy lyrics will definitely put some people off, however.

B001KL3GY0|5.0|These days it is extremely rare that I find an album I can enjoy from beginning to end. One where none of the tracks sound like \\"filler\\". I can say with confidence this is one of those rare albums. With a very original sound that will make you want to move this album has it all. Not only do these guys rock the house, they give you a little sample of dance, funk, disco and blend it in beautifully to create an unforgettable and irresistable product. Not only is this my favorite Franz Ferdinand album, it is one of my favorites that I've ever had. A must for anyone who appreciates good music and wants something different for a change.
B0007TKNII|5.0|In the world of musicals, there have been many standouts; \\"South Pacific\\", \\"Oklahoma\\", \\"My Fair Lady\\", and \\"The Sound of Music\\" are just a few of the wonders that have delighted audiences the world over. But in recent times, no one has captured the imagination of fans everywhere like Andrew Lloyd Webber and his masterpiece, \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\". Eighteen years after opening on the West End and sixteen years after beginning on Broadway, \\"Phantom\\" has finally taken the world by storm as a movie. And it's still unbeatable.    Of the many critics of the film, the main complaint has been with casting - mainly, that of the lead role. While Michael Crawford shone in the theater production, the choice of Gerard Butler as the movie phantom had many heads being scratched. Butler doesn't have as commanding of a voice as Crawford, yet it still works. His gravelly tone and dangerous appeal play a nice complement to the smooth tones of Patrick Wilson as Raoul, and it is this danger that lures Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum) to his dark world.    When some musicals make the transition to film, they remain as they were on stage, resulting in a somewhat stilted performance. The fact that \\"Phantom\\" doesn't follow its stage counterpart exactly is a welcome relief. The movie mainly acts as a flashback, with short interruptions to show the present-day, shot as if they were film reels of the early 20th century. This nicely breaks up parts that would not have fared so well on the screen.     Overall, \\"Phantom\\" is a delight to watch on the screen. Butler and Wilson are brilliantly matched as foes, and Emmy Rossum shines as Christine Daae - I actually prefer her performance to that of Sarah Brightman. Lush and overstated, it captures the passion of the story in a way that will leave you breathless.

B0002OERI0|5.0|After listening to Greendays \\"21st century\\" for the first time, I had to go back to write about \\"American Idiot\\"  I always hoped that Greenday's next album would somehow top this work of art.  I'm honestly not sure what to think of their new one.  I can say without a doubt that \\"American Idiot\\" is one of the best albums I have ever heard.  With much dismay I have to say \\"American Idiot\\" is still this bands best album.  Every track proves time and again that creativity isn't dead yet.
0783226845|5.0|If you want to see what it means to be best actor then there is no doubt that this movie is the one to watch.  Al Pacino is absolutely incredible.  A young Chris O'donnell is excellent as well.  The title makes sense if you watch the movie but you won't understand it if you haven't seen the movie.  This is simply worth watching because of the acting.  It is a solid story and very unique but is a bit long.  I recommend the movie simply on the fact that it is worth every second watching Al Pacino playing the role of Lt Col Slade.  The ending is one you won't forget either.  What a great flick!
0783230370|4.0|What a strange silly film. 1994 was not a great year I guess for Hollywood and for Schwarzenegger. Apart from being absurd, the humor there may have been between some of the frames and shots has disappeared. The film still survives as some kind of entertaining slow motion mental disposal animated and agitated void and empty discourse on the taste of the cosmic wind on the other side of the moon. But if you want to taste the slightly nostalgic vision of San Francisco and its cable cars be my guest and enjoy the trip.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID
B00004Y6NT|5.0|Excellent second album from the most underrated musican ever! Mark K. is  just the man. He can switch from a beautiful ballad to a catchy rocker  without effort. Ranks right up there with Clapton, etc.
B0000041Z5|5.0|I can only share the enthusiasm of reviewers who praise these performances by Georg Solti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. I own most of the Brahms box sets (Chailly, Harnoncourt, Karajan, Bernstein, Bohm, etc.), but I have to say I'm most impressed with these recordings. I actually prefer Solti's and Harnoncourt's to Karajan's acclaimed cycle.<br /><br />I'm not sure what is about these performances that make them so great. The tempi are excellent and not rushed. The overall sound quality is really good, especially considering this particular box set was released in 1991. The performance from the Chicago Symphony is excellent.<br /><br />To all those who enjoy Brahms' music, you really should consider this set. Highly recommended.
143915726X|4.0|My Sister's Keeper is mostly the story of two sisters: Anna, who was diagnosed with leukemia when she was two, and Kate, who was conceived so her umbilical cord could be transplanted to save Anna. Kate is now thirteen, and she has decided to sue her parents for medical emancipation because every time Anna is sick, Kate must offer pieces of her body up to save her.<br /><br />It's a harrowing tale told from the point of view of Kate, her mom (via flashbacks dating back to Anna's first diagnosis), her dad, her brother (a juvenile delinquent), her attorney, and her guardian ad litum. While the story is told through multiple voices, I found myself identifying (and enjoying) Kate's parts best. She truly wrestles with her love for her sister and her yearning for independence, as any thirteen-year-old would.<br /><br />There are no easy answers in this book, and it's a fascinating look at a complex issue both legally, medically and emotionally. For the record, although I don't know what the new ending is, I'm appalled the movie has a different ending. I will try to withhold full judgment until I see it, but I can't imagine any ending as more appropriate than the one Picoult wrote.
B00000F5KH|5.0|\\"Central Station\\" is a Brazilian movie with a simple story line, but it has a tender, affirmative take that many moviegoers will embrace. A spinster, a crotchety middle-aged crone, a professional letter writer in the central railroad station in Rio, is visited by a mother and her son who see her in order to have her write and send a letter to the absent, perhaps shiftless father. (She has a touch of larceny; sometimes she doesn't mail the letters.)<br /> When the mother gets killed in an automobile accident, the boy desperately needs the letter writer as a link to his father. An act of greed on her part sends them into each other's orbit. They begin a crosscountry odyssey looking for the father. Throughout the movie and on that journey we see how the lower end of the economic ladder live in Brazil.<br /> It's a movie with compassion, a warm feeling, a feel-good movie. We see good people and acts of kindness. The spinster evolves, learns a great deal about herself as the story progresses and as she grows fond of the boy. The spinster is turned around by the persistent, insistent boy whose single-minded goal is finding his father. She almost finds romance with a good-hearted truck driver, but that proves elusive when he keeps on trucking.<br /> You'll feel some tearjerking sentimentality, but the movie shows how the humanity of people can build bonds.<br /> It's a movie with superb acting, a gentle touch, and insights into what makes us tick as human beings when faced by adversity.
0525421033|5.0|Gayle Forman's young adult novel, If I Stay, is tremendous. It's the story of a lovely family in Oregon: punk rockers turned cool parents and their two children Mia, a gifted cellist and high school senior and Teddy. The bulk of the story is told by Mia through flashbacks after the family is in a car accident. She tries to figure out if she's alive, and if so, should she stay when her family is gone.<br /><br />What could easily become schlocky or depressing is ultimately uplifting in the deft hands of Forman. The characters are a family I want to have over for dinner. The book is a mere two hundred pages, but Forman manages to have not just one, but a multitude of well-formed, likeable characters.<br /><br />Yes, it's a young adult novel, but I would recommend it to adult readers as well. It's a timeless tale, and it's the second-best book I've read this year.
143915726X|1.0|I bought this book even though reading the reviews made me a little wary.  I should have listened to my inner voice.  This is truly one of the cheesiest books I have ever read.  I have so many complaints about it, it is difficult for me to list them all but I will touch on my bigger ones.  Number one, was the voice of the main character Anna.  I don't care how intelligent this 13 year old is, even the most precocious of children would not talk like this. It annoyed me so much I could hardly look past it and finish the book.      Secondly, the lawyer and his relationship with the guardian.  The reason for their breakup as teenagers was completely unrealistic.  I doubt any 17 year old boy would be so worried about someone's \\"freedom\\". Most would not even be able to understand the implications of the disease that they had just been diagnosed with. The fact that they kept it a big secret throughout the book was so dumb.  Number one, it could be guessed pretty quickly if you have even cursory knowledge about service dogs.  All those stupid one liners he would give to people who asked him what his service dog was for made me want to scream.  Also, I highly doubt that that many people would be rude enough to even ask what his service dog was for.  \\"Why do you have a service dog?  You're not blind!\\" say eight million people in this book followed by a silly one liner from the lawyer.   Gag!  As was the fact that after having a seizure, he then returned less than an hour later to finish arguing his case in court and then drove home.  The author seems so meticulous in her research about cancer but then she throws that at the reader and expects us to buy it.      Then of course there is the ridiculous ending.  The scene where they pull the plug and let Anna go after harvesting her organs let you know that they left her heart and lungs in place.  Why would they donate only her kidneys and not the rest of her organs?  A family who had been through all of this suffering and had been on the waiting end of an organ transplant would certainly have wanted to give the gift of all of her organs, not just taking what they needed and leaving the rest to be buried with her.  I would like to think they would not be that selfish.    The character Jesse was equally over dramatized.  His voice, too, was overly precocious.  Many many things about his story were unbelievable.  That he wouldn't get caught for his arson and then would go on to become a police officer despite having a juvenile rap sheet a mile long.  He stole a dump truck, for goodness sake and used it as his getaway vehicle!          The only characters that seemed real and not caricatures were the mother, Sara and the father Brian.  I could actually sympathize with them and it led me to some thought about what I would do facing a similar situation.     That is the only thought this book provoked.  It was just a bunch of cheesy, over dramatization.  I know that this book is fiction, but one can only suspend so much disbelief. Run!  Run away from this silly silly book as fast as you can.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Who doesnt love a book that has real, loving characters? Hosseini made a book that touches and warms the heart. Needless to say he didn't disappoint. He showed the true nature of women suffering in silence. He portrays the bond between two women stuck in the same situation extraordinarily well. This book got me wanting to help less fortunate people. I am truly grateful that I live where I live and I highly recommend this book.

0767817664|4.0|An 80's \\"classic,\\" FRIGHT NIGHT is a straightforward (and yet tongue-in-cheek) vampire film that doesn't have any real surprises, but which never fails to entertain.  Chris Sarandon mugs it up as the bloodsucker who moves next door, and our teen leads are suitably cute and pathetic as they run around trying to enlist the aid of skeptical cops and the narrator of a nightly horror show called, of course, FRIGHT NIGHT.<br /><br />There are a few things you might cringe at.  I found the spikey-haired friend (Ebo?  Is that what they kept calling him?) to be shrill and annoying.  And the cheesy 80's dance scene went on two verses too long, but overall I was impressed by the special effects, the dedication to detail, and the fact that the movie never tried to be anything other than a good, old fashioned, fang-flick.
B001TOD92C|5.0|Pierwszy film Darrena Aronofskiego 'Pi: Faith in Chaos' zaostrzyl moj artystyczny apetyt. Niestety kolejne jego filmy ('Requiem for a Dream', 'Fountain') byly dla mnie coraz bardziej wiednacym rozczarowaniem. Choc byc moze staralem sie w nich dostrzec czegos nieistniejacego, jakiejs metafizycznej idei. Zauwazalnym poniekad spoiwem wszystkich filmow Aronofskiego jest bol. Gleboki, powszechnie znany bol; zarowno fizyczny jak i psychiczny.<br />Wedlug slow rezysera 'Wrestler' jest filmem o sporcie, zawodniku, oraz zakulisowych realiach sportowego przemyslu rozrywkowego. I jest to obraz zaprojektowany i wykonany bardzo dobrze. Dokumentalna estetyka filmu - oparta na szorstkosci swiata sportu - fantastycznie podkresla napiecie personalnej historii tytulowego bohatera. Mickey Rourke ('Body Heat', '9 1/2 Weeks', 'Wild Orchid', 'Sin City') gra tu role zpasnika ktorego dawna swietnosc juz wygasla, pozostawiajac mu splowiala peleryne wspomnien oraz medalowa kolekcje cielesnych blizn. Nie majac jednakze innej zyciowej alternatywy, byly mistrz skazany jest na kontynuowanie swojej meczacej i fizycznie bolesnej kariery. Dodatkowym zadziorem w zyciu zapasnika jest fiasko jego kariery rodzinnej, oraz nieudane proby ozywienia zapomnianych kontaktow z corka.<br />Calkiem udana rola filmowa wydobyla Rourke z cienia Hollywoodzkiego niebytu, choc musze przyznac ze nie moge podzielic gloryfikujacych slow uznania i zachwytu nad emocjonalna glebia jego gry aktorskiej, wielokrotnie wypowiadanych przez Aronofskiego. Obiecujaca zas wydaje sie byc kontrapunkcyjna rola egzotycznej tancerki w klubie dla mezczyzn, zagranej niespodziewanie odwaznie przez Marise Tomei ('My Cousin Vinny', 'Chaplin', \\"In the Bedroom').<br />Byc moze jest to film o ludziach pelnych wzajemnego wspolczucia, probujacych budowac pomosty laczace ich nie tylko ze soba, ale tez i z ich wlasna przeminieta swietnoscia; o ludziach uwiezionych w realiach swiata im wspolczesnego.<br />Zachecam do osobistej oceny.<br /><br />Hotel Detective.

1416562605|5.0|Skillfully written, provacative, and irreverent, Aravind Adiga's novel focuses on the great divide between India's rich and poor and the mistrust and corruption that runs like a poison through all levels of society.   In a first person narrative, Adiga unfolds the story of Balram, a servant driver, and his  ascension from the darkness (the poor underbelly of Indian society) to the light (the self-serving wealthy who hold all the strings).  The story is relayed with a wit and candor that are hilarious at times, but are just as often uncomfortable to read as Balram becomes harden to societal injustices and uses them to justify his own maniacal actions.  The book has received criticism for being a \\"caricature\\" of India; though, this IS the intended goal of the author.  The novel is a satirical comedy, one that nonetheless deftly describes the raw side of a sector of society that functions through exploitation and corruption.  Adiga's contemporary style of writing offers a fresh alternative to readers who would like a deeper look at such strugges within Indian society, poltics, and culture.
B000002GBD|5.0|For me this one is tied with \\"Loud n Proud\\" as Nazareth's best, but while that one had all he best songs.  This one is the most consistant.  Only $8.00 I'm sold. Some really great songs are here too. \\"Changing Times\\" could be Zepplin. \\"Love Hurts\\" is a cover that is better than the original Everly Bros song. Ditto for \\"Beggars Day\\". \\"Rose in the Heather is a beautiful intrumental with some great slide guitar work fom Manny Charlton.  \\"Whiskey Dringing Woman\\" goes back to their sense of humor side and sounds like Skynrd. I'm not even gonna go into the two opening tracks, lets just say they kick major butt.  As fo the band they are in great form.  McCaffrey doing his best Rod Stewart meets Brian Johnson vocals.  We already mentioned Chalton. Darrel Sweet & Pete Agnew were a very good rythm section & had their game down by now.  Everyone who has a slight interest about how 70 rock was should check this one out.

The point of view of the person with the disease grabbed me from the beginning.  The symptoms are so true to life.  I would recommend this book to anyone whether they've known someone with Alzheimers or not.

0307266303|5.0|When have you seen a book with this many reviews and none below 5 stars? You know what this book is about from the other descriptions and reviews. Here's how I feel about it. This is the first time I've reviewed a book on Amazon.com and it's the first thing I wanted to do when I finished the book ten minutes ago. The second thing I will do is email many of my friends to urge them to get the book. I will NOT loan them my copy! My wife will be reading it next, though I interrupted her so many times to read portions of it that she is already thinking of people to tell about it.  I've been a serious runner (sometimes more/often less) for 40 years and have read countless articles and books about running. This is the best. It satisfied my running soul and my academic mind. I couldn't wait to finish it and I didn't want it to end.
1401207529|3.0|I bought the comic because I read a lot of reviews about how good this comic was. Well, now I can say I disagree. It's not a masterpiece at all. Perhaps I'm trying to compare it with the great film Batman Begins, or just with the antiheroe masterpiece Watchmen. But it's not only this.    There is no real story with progression, which is what I expect of a limited comic. Gordon and Bruce Wayne come to the city and start to push criminals. Gordon's story is good, but Batman's isn't. It's funny and realistic to see Batman in his origins, as a rockie, avoiding the Police, being wounded... But then what? The film showed us how he started to train, to improve his suit and then the story goes on. There are main enemies and Batman wins over them. Here it's not that way. Batman just didn't confront any main enemy and send him to jail. He only appears to save Gordon's child and everything is over. You turn the page and there is no more. \\"What? Isn't Batman going to rock any bad guy?\\" \\"No, he isn't. It's over.\\"    Even though, the art is good. Gordon story is also fine. But there is no argumental line to folow. The problem presented at first (criminal mobs) is not resolved. I know Batman can't triumph over all the criminals forever and not in a single comic. But the least I hope it's seeing his origins, and a criminal boss as a key enemy, who is presented and defeted at the end of the story. Even if he returns in the future. But I want to see progresion.     And yes, it's funny to see a rockie and a Dark Batman. But not THAT funy. I still want one story to follow over the pages. Please, watch the film if you want to see Dark Knight origins and Watchmen if you want to know the darkest aspects of heroes.
B001UW58YU|4.0|This is a very good concert. The guy is immensely likable and very talented. However, two other reviewers have commented on the downsides that I also see - firstly that it is a fairly bland concert with no real pizzaz and secondly that I can see no reason to have paid for the Blu-ray disc when it is almost discernible from the standard DVD. Fans will not feel let down - but, in terms of format, I suppose it may come down to what you feel able to afford.

B001I9O9L8|2.0|Probably my own fault but I hadn't realized that this is a quite early video dating from the period not long after Sting left Police. It isn't a full length rock concert - it is more of a documentary - and it was probably very enjoyable in its day. However, it isn't much of a spectacle as a Blu-ray offering and I'm afraid that, despite being a fan of Sting and his work, I just didn't enjoy his persona in this recording. Maybe Blu-ray has just the raised the bar on recent recordings and hence, in comparison to other offerings, my expectations were not met here. Most Sting fans will like this but will probably also own the DVD already - there is nothing in my mind to justify the increased cost of Blu-ray.
B000VFGQUC|4.0|Great \\"Live and Dangerous\\" concert footage with Gorham/Robertson that looks great on the big screen and has excellent 5.1 sound. Phil Lynott's massive talent as a frontman / bassist / vocalist is incredible to watch, it's such a shame he's gone already. His songwriting talent was underrated and underappreciated IMO.  Additional concert footage with the John Sykes era lineup is also very cool, plus video clips that include Eric Bell (Whiskey in the Jar) and a yound Gary Moore on at least one song. Seeing that brought back memories of my only time seeing Thin Lizzy live, in San Franciso circa 1979 with The Cars opening, and Kansas headlining. Gary Moore was all over the stage, and just the most incredible guitarist I had ever seen. He left an indelible impression on me. The Interviews with Brian Downey, Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson are insightful and very cool, hearing there perspective and recollections of the early days of the band.  True fans don't miss this one...it Rocks.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|We have been watching Lonesome Dove on VHS for years, and decided to upgrade to DVD.  Not only do you get much better quality, but this is an anniversary edition...so many extras.  Just buy it, you know you want to.
1439138311|2.0|Having married a Brooklyn 'boy' who was an avid Dodger fan, lived in Bensonhurst and Flatbush, heard of the stories of the Irish, Italian and Scandinavian influences, blue collar workers, living in small apartments, living over stores, and in general how things were...I expected so much more from this novel.  It seemed at times that the writer was penning a teen novel, the pages went on and on in an extremely 'simple' fashion.  If it weren't for a few 'racey' pages, I would have been convinced that this book's intended audience was not an adult one.   I cared very little about the characters; although there were a few heart wrenching moments of reflection and observation.  It did not move, grab the reader, or supply any truly worthy story.  I wish it had.    Somehow, the ending....was concilliatory...it was just what she did, rather than any real caring and emotion.  Somehow too, the main characters were in their innocence selfish and one dimensional.
4789009637|5.0|I bought this after trying Contemporary Japanese.  Genki is very straight forward.  There are a lot of \\"with your partner\\" in the practice areas and as I don't have a partner, I write them all out minus the ones where is asks for specific information on fellow students.  I find that this has helped me in remembering vocabulary and my writing as I am constantly repeating certain sentences.      It can get a little confusing with the grammar especially the particles so I am going to buy a supplementary book to help me with that.    Personally I find that even though everything is formal and others may complain about how it sounds but I think that for a beginner this book is great!  If you think about it, when you learned English or whatever your native language is, you didn't speak, read or write it perfectly.  It took time to learn and listen to others to get it right.  And this is what this book does.  It may not have you speaking the greatest when you're done, but it will get you speaking, reading and writing more than you were before.

0316017922|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell is a great synthesizer. He's masterful at taking a few random ideas and events and weaving them into a pattern that can help us see how the world operates. He's got a reputation as a deep thinker, but I'd suggest that he's not thinking deeply as much as broadly -- though that still has tremendous value.    In \\"Outliers,\\" Gladwell looks at people whose achievements have put them far on the end of the success scale (and, in one memorable chapter about airline pilots, at the failure end). Gladwell challenges the notion that these people were self-made, and that their outsized achievements were due completely or almost completely to their capabilities and effort. Gladwell dissects their achievements to show that each person or group of people benefited from being in the right place at the right time, with just enough cultural capital and smarts to take advantage of the fluke of time and place.     Gladwell makes a compelling argument, and his examples are solid. While some reviewers have pointed out that Gladwell's research seems to be little more that Wikipedia citings and well-known books and journals, he has done a good job of putting that information into a coherent whole. He's not using dubious information or making things up, so I'm not sure why some people have raised a fuss.  Gladwell is doing what popularizers always do: They take original work created by others and turn it into something that's more accessible and relevant to a wider audience. It's no different than a history book by Doris Kearns Goodwin.    Anyway, what's in the book? The book looks at several types of high achievers and asks how those folks got there. Inevitably, it's a combination of luck and effort -- whether it's top amateur hockey players in Canada, Bill Gates and Bill Joy, or top New York City lawyers. Each person was born at an ideal time and was able to leverage his small advantages over others into an overwhelming advantage in adulthood. For hockey players, it's thebenefits of being a few months older than competing kids, which then leads to getting selected to elite teams and getting better and more practice as a teen. With Gates and Joy, it was access to computers right at the time when programming first became relatively efficient to do. For the lawyers, it was being forced to work in mergers-and-acquisition law when top firms wouldn't hire them, and then being the most knowledgeable about that type of law when it became the most lucrative part of law in the 1980s.     Along the way, Gladwell provides interesting asides about how cultures (especially American) have advanced over the decades, and what was important at what time. It makes you think about how you would position yourself for the next breakthrough opportunity -- and if it's possible to see it coming. And it also makes you think about the inordinate effort that the most successful still had to undertake in order to seize the advantage.    However, the book has some weaknesses. One is that Gladwell only occasionally writes about people who were also in the same place at the same time and didn't seize the opportunity. Why didn't they? Was it brains, effort, culture? Probably it's a combination of all those factors, but I'd like to see more discussion about missed opportunities.     Also, the success stories in the book don't vary very much. People are either filthy rich or have risen to the top of the law-medical-academic profession.  What about a religious leader or a community organizer? What about an entertainer besides The Beatles?  Variation would have been good.    Another weakness is (pointed out by others) is that Gladwell's definition of success, and therefore of an outlier, is vague. It seems to have something to do with absolution pinnacles of wealth and power -- The Beatles, robber barons, Bill Gates, and Robert Oppenheimer. But it also seems to have to do with guys who are just super-successful lawyers, but who didn't have any lasting impact on the profession, or kids who have risen out of poverty to go to college, or kids who won college hockey scholarships.     Yet, truly unique people -- the ones who change the world -- can't be produced by a standardized system. But the ones who do well, and perhaps beyond expectations, actually can be produced by a system. The system isn't always fair, as richer kids have a much better chance of winning in the academic world, for example. But that's a very different issue than how The Beatles found their magic. Gladwell is drawing a link between the two that they both are reflections of their time, place, culture, etc., but I think that argument is stretched.    The other thing that's annoying about the book is Gladwell's written tic. He italicizes words and phrases that he wants to emphasize. It's as if he thinks we're not smart enough to understand the point he's making, so he has to lay it out for us.     One final note. Up until the last chapter, the book reads like a business school case study. It's written clearly, and it has occasional humor and memorable characters or events. But it feels impersonal. Then, in the last chapter, Gladwell changes tone. He tells his family's tale as it reflects his thesis, and it's quite moving. It's a great way to end the book, and, frankly, a little more of that emotion would have been beneficial all the way through.
B00000251N|5.0|Stirring, soulful, inspiring and haunting all at the same time. To say that they do not make music like this anymore is an understatement. Although the source material for this soundtrack is firmly rooted in the 70's it has the ability to do what only great works can. It transcends time. I was given the book earlier this year by a very good friend who knew that I needed to read it. Wow! Once I started I could not put it down. I think I finished it in about an hour.      Thanks to Amazon for having this in stock. I ordered two copies of the dvd-one of which I will give to my friend. Although she loves the book she never knew that there was a film, so this way I get to return something of value to her.        This is definately Neil Diamond's best work. It was difficult to get past the song - Be. When I thought that it could not get any better the sequence with- Dear Father- kicked in and it had me, totally, utterly under it's spell. If you need something to just have playing in the background while you are doing stuff around the house, or need something to take away some of the stresses of daily life this can be a powerful meditation for anyone who understands.       This soundtrack along with the dvd would make a cherished gift for someone that needs a little uplifting.        A true classic!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This was so good, I had to see it on DVD again. The acting, staging, story editing, etc., were excellent. Paul Giamatti portrayed Adams very well: a brilliant man not well versed in public relations skills, with so much perseverance in getting those supplies from France that he lost his manners. What a departure for Giamatti from \\"Sideways\\". Laura Linney also did an excellent job. Through these two great actors, I felt John and Abigail Adams's kinship (\\"Dear Friend\\"), love, passion, dedication to their families and country.    The George Washington and Ben Franklin portrayals were very believable, almost uncanny. I think Jefferson, though, had a more fluid personality than was shown here.    I also want to comment to others about some things they brought up. First, book vs. movie: an author has the freedom to explore as much as he/she likes in their writing and is free to portray a more genial Adams at any time. McCullough is a documentary writer, not a novelist. The HBO series turned his doc into a novelist kind of movie, which is to be expected. Therefore, there should be more tension, active drama and high conflict than is portrayed in a doc.  Second, it's a good idea to judge the book as it is - non-fiction - and the series as it is - a MOVIE. I'm glad I didn't read the book first, because now I want to.     Some memorable scenes which stick in my mind:    Our first Congress voting for independence. Not the high-minded, self-assured image schoolchildren get of lofty men in fancy velvet clothes, but one of a group of vulnerable men expressing great hesitation and fear in heavy silence. The look of \\"Holy crap\\" on their faces was priceless, after the near-unanimous vote. They had everything to lose, and they knew it too well.    Dinner time at the grand dame's chateau in France. In the height of frivolous and lusty chatter at the table, Adams -- surrounding by painted men and women (many of them prostitutes) was obviously, painfully out of his league. Suddenly he demands in his strident manner, \\"We need ships and supplies!\\"  And what does he get instead? Glassy stares from his stunned hosts. And there's Franklin, ready to sink into his chair! Priceless. Adams learned his manners eventually and softened the hard edges. Now, I don't know if this really happened, but again, it's a MOVIE, not a doc. Tension, conflict, drama!    Nabby's breast surgery. The pain and terror this brave woman went through, with no anesthesia -- I cannot begin to imagine. Same with the man on the ship when a cannon ball from the British maimed him and his leg had to be cut. These scenes make me appreciate what they went through, and how easy we have it today.    I recommend HBO's \\"John Adams\\" (on DVD) to anyone who wants a dramatic story about the Adams' intimate lives and their struggle for seeing our country to its independence. And to round everything out, read McCullough's book, too.
B00260HH3K|1.0|Since 2002, me and many other Dragonball fans around the world have feverishly anticipated the release of a live action adaptation of one of the most beloved anime franchises the world over.     The idea of a live action Dragonball movie brings so much potential to the table, and really changes the perspective of film making in bringing an anime to life, and bringing fantasy to life in a whole new way. This should have been something we have never seen before, it should have been aw-inspiring, captivating, and capturing the very essence of the Dragonball series that so many people have grown up with and come to expect.     Sadly, Dragonball Evolution is perhaps one of the worst movies I have ever laid my eyes on. Not only is this movie a wretched failure from a \\"fan\\" point of view since I am a fan of the material, but also as someone who loves and watches movies, and pays attention to Hollywood.     Within the last two years, we have seen some truely great films including. The Dark Knight, Iron Man, No Country for Old Men, Transformers, There Will Be Blood, Slumdog Millionaire, and many many more that would take up too much of this review.     With Dragonball Evolution, it takes all of the high calbur oscar-worthy/winning acting, and high grade special effects and production values, and pretty much takes it out with one destructive \\"air-bending\\" Ka-Me-Ha-Me-Ha(a little inside joke on the movie).     The movie is so out of touch with its source material, this movie can hardly be called \\"Dragonball\\". Outside of name-sake(or Marque value) such as Dragonballs, Goku, Bulma, Yamcha, Shenlong, Ma-fu-ba(sealing technique for Piccolo), Piccolo, Grampa Gohan, Mai, Chi Chi, Master Roshi, Oozaru, and the Ka-Me-Ha-Me-Ha. This movie has next to nothing to do with the original story and characters.     Even if I was not a fan of the Dragoball series, and did'nt know what it was, I still would have found this movie attrociously bad.     The movie has so many problems, it's hard tolist them all, because some just don't make any sense, or they are so confusing, it's really hard to put any of the movie into a coherent perspective.     I'll start with the performances of the actors. Simply put, Abysmal. They deliver pointless dialogue, have pointless scenes, no chemistry outside of boy-like-girl love interest, and lets you know you're watching a bad movie and nothing else. The actors are either un-interesting, extremely campy, or the dialogue is so horrendous you just cringe at it.     You would think with an actor like Chow Yun Fat on board, this movie would have some deceny to it. But sadly no, his performance may be one of the worst of his career. Goku(Justin Chatwin) is beyond un-compelling. He's just anger inducing to see him portray Goku in such poor character. Lusting after girls affections, wanting popularity, picked on by bullies for no reasonable explanation. Gag me with a spoon.     The story makes little sense. 2,000 years ago, Piccolo with his disciple the \\"Oozaru\\"(that's right, not even calling him a \\"Saiyan\\") tried to destroy/take over the world but was thwarted by monks and Piccolo was sealed away. Without any explanation, Piccolo is free from his prison, has Mai(his hench-woman) at his side(who by the way has no back story to explain how/why she's with him), he's in an air-ship. And we are given no explanation throughout the film on his full intentions, or anything else relating to his character. Also, he has the shortest amount of screentime of the movie, totaling 5 scenes.    Meanwhile Goku is turing 18, gets a dragonball from Gohan, and Goku is somehow involved this cliched prophecy with an eclipse that relates to Piccolo wanting to destroy/take over the world for no reason what so ever.    Later on with the final battle of the film is where the continuity of the film throws its hands in the air and walks away from the movie. Piccolo is somehow able to control the \\"Oozaru\\" side of Goku, and that Goku is the \\"Oozaru\\" from 2,000 years ago who served Piccolo. There's absolutely no explanation at all as to how Piccolo is manipulating Gokus transformation, or how he even knows that he's a Sayain. Or if Goku is the Oozaru, then what the hell is going on? And if Goku is 18, then how was he alive 2000 years ago serving Piccolo? It's a total mind meltdown.    The movie is just full of continuity problems that plague the film from the main plot, to the character sub-plots that amount to absolutely nothing and have no sort of resolution. The special effects are horridly done, there's so much wire work you could swear they worked in a circus. And it's just a completely un-interesting film.     The acting is laughable and completely unbelieveable in any sense, the fighting and special effects are poorly done and look unconvincing, and overall boring. The story and plots are poorly written, confusing, and even leave a fan of the series like myself, completely lost in the continuity issues that plague this film.     This is easily one of the worst films FOX Studios has ever produced based on a major worldwide franchise. Do not buy this movie, it is a waste of time, and a complete disgrace to the series many fans know and love. But this is also an insult to people wanting to see a good movie, you're going to have to look elsewhere because this movie has no entertainment value to speak of.    Overall, this movie is about as cliche as you can possibly get by ripping off of better movies like Spiderman and the Matrix, but also being totally un-original, and just making no sense what so ever with its story, characters, and relating to the Dragonball series.

0792165020|5.0|\\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\" was released in North America on Christmas Day, 1999 and became a boxoffice smash. Starring Oscar winner Matt Damon in the title role, the movie is about a man who entangles himself into the life of a rich shipping heir, Dicky, played superbly by Jude Law. Thomas Ripley goes to beautiful Italy, on the advice and expense of Dicky's dad, who wants Tom to bring his playboy son back to the U.S.. Once he gets there not only is Tom Ripley smitten by Dicky's extravagent lifestyle, but he is also smitten with Dicky himself. Once Tom realizes that Dicky will not give into his (Tom's) advances, he kills him. This is where the movie really takes off as Thomas takes over Dicky's life. The film is about stealing not only someone's identity, but their very own life.<br /> The acting is flawless, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Cate Blanchett, and Gwyneth Paltrow all deliver excellent supporting acting performances. Anthony Minghella, who directed the superb \\"English Patient\\", outdoes himself in this film. He should have received an Oscar for his directing, as not only does he bring out the best in his cast, but he brings out the best in his shooting locales. Filming on location is difficult for any director, but once you see the directorial work in \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\", you will understand that filming this piece of art was no easy task. When I watch this movie it is unlike any I have viewed, as I feel like I am actually in Italy. The scenic locations are exquisite and they add to the drama of this masterpiece of the cinema.<br /> The movie was nominated for five Oscars, sadly winning none, and the film was budgeted at forty million dollars. No expense was spared when making this work.<br /> The DVD contains a neat commentary by Minghella, and there is a neat documentary on the making of the film with the cast. The trailer is included and the film is in widescreen.<br /> This is definitely a five star movie!
B0013FSL3E|3.0|This film ought to have worked.     For me, applying adult judgement, Pixar are a brilliant outfit who have great production standards, tremendous imagination, an amusing and quirky sense of humour which provides something for adults watching with their offspring, and enormous skill at animation. None of those things were missing from this film. My children have enjoyed everything else Pixar have done - that's an understatement - and I expected them to love this DVD too.     They didn't.     The trouble was that the bleak and lonely start, with the last robot on an abandoned Earth, having been left on his own for centuries as he gradually tidied up a planet humans had messed up, was played just a bit too strongly to work for my seven-year-old children.     The sombre opening reduced my daughter to floods of tears, and after about 20 minutes she gave up and went off, thoroughly depressed, to do something else. My son did watch the whole film, and reported that overall the film was \\"OK\\" as there were some \\"better parts\\" but this was a much less enthusiastic response than he normally gives PIXAR's offerings.     I think that this illustrates the old saying that no-one can please everyone, and particularly that nobody can please every child. I am quite certain that millions of other children will have loved this film. Unfortunately some didn't like it, and my daughter was among them.     I am not writing this review with the intention of advising other parents not to get this for your children. It's very possible that they will get far more out of the film than my two did. But if your children are on the soft-hearted and sentimental side, watch it with them, and be ready to put something else on if you do find that your family, like mine, is one for whom this particular film does not work.
B001FB55MG|1.0|Mr Sandler wasn't a very good actor, and the writers did a very poor job on the script. It was a waste of time watching it.
B000GYI32M|3.0|I found the third season to be a tale of two halves. The first half was very disappointing. It was hurt by new irratating and implausable characters. (Johnny, I thought, was boring. Jim Cooper, an old character, was pathetic. I would have preferred to see that he grew and learned from his mistakes.)<br /><br />Some of the story lines were also implausable and weak. I suspect this was partly because there was no great conflict in the series. Ryan had become assimilated into Newport and was no longer at odds with it. (I think a nice twist would have been to deepen the conflict between Marissa and her new public-school world.)<br /><br />In short, I no longer knew what the series was about, or what important goals its characters had.<br /><br />I found the the second half of the season much better, especially because the series seemed to take a deeper, more dramatic turn. (It was certainly an adult drama as much as a teen one.) Yes, there were some problems - I felt Seth's pot smoking happened too fast and wasn't developed - but I like the way Julie's character seemed to grow and the way Kristen battled her alcoholism.<br /><br />It seemed the good, likeable characters - to me the most endearing part of the series - had a more central role.<br /><br />Finally, though I know some will disagree, I think Vollcheck, a perfect, believable rival to Ryan, brought a much needed sense of good vs. evil. I now had someone to root against.<br /><br />And so I again became addicted to The O.C.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|[...]     Please fan check this out.  as well    [...]    There is a user called ADYWAN. Believe it or not, this man has already created the STAR WARS blu-rays. The fans includen me already got their hands on episodes IV and V. This fan with a real heart for the movies is currently in the works for episode VI and the rest.    Believe it or not, these versions, have been taken from an HDTV bradcast in germany (16gb of raw material). ADYWAN, as he called himself on the net used this raw material. He first had the passion to do a complete color correction of the movies, and then perfected it.    Amazingly, in his version Greedo does not shoot Han Solo first, he corrected it, which was amazing for guys like me who remeber how the original was.     He also corrected the terrible \\"pink\\" Darth Vader lightsaber from the 2004 DVD realase. Also corrected the horrible blueish version of the 2004 DVD release of ESB.    Versions of this true masterpieces are already avaliable on the net, and ready to pop in into any PS3 and Blu-Ray on just a burned DVD9 AVCHD disc.    I must say, they are indeed a miracle. I'm watching them at full 1080p 24p, color corrected, garbage taken out, as it should have been at the beginning.    This is what happens when the wait is too long. This is what happens when the fans get dissapointed because of the greed of a corporation Lucas.    After watching this great and passionate job. I'm rest assured we don't need to wait until 2012 or the end of the world to watch the trilogy.     I say it is much better to watch the job of a true artist, who hasn't even been compensated for doing this, and instead put his heart and love for the movies to make this happen.    I seriously doubt at this point that whatever Blu-Ray version Lucas comes out, would be able to surpass this one.    This \\"Star Wars Revisited\\" version is made with true love and passion. Instead of an overdelayed Blu-Ray version made just for profit.    Please check this out and support the guy.

B001FB55HG|4.0|A lot of people seem to want to hate this film and I can understand that people are basing it off the great precident set forth by the first two films, but if you go into a movie with the expectation it will be bad than you will not be pleased no matter what you see on the screen. I love the first two films and consider them the only part of the franchise that contribute to the actual lore of the Terminator world created by James Cameron. This movie is the first movie that actually shows us the future that Sarah was so valiantly trying to prevent.<br /><br />Let me start off by proposing something in terms of the storyline in this film. This film takes place, supposedly, before John Connor sends Kyle Reese back in time to save his mother and in effect concieve John. If this is the case, I do not think we should be seeing a fully developed leader in John Connor at this point, which we don't. Christian Bale gives a solid performance, despite his cold demeanor and lack of ability to control the situation, despite having his mother's advice. The movie is clearly the setup for at least one more film, possibly two(depending on the gross) and is a very good starting point.<br /><br />The effects are just outstanding in the film, to say the least. I actually enjoyed very much that they started this film with the \\"lumbering hulk\\" T-800's as the primitive Terminators instead of jumping right into a realm of something much more advanced. If you're planning more films, you can't throw out your best material in the first film, you just can't, so I understand the logic. The HK's are great, but the best on-screen behemoth is by far the massive 4-5 story tall Termninator(I want to say they are called Chimera, or were in Cameron's versions possibly). I actually thought they did a pretty good job sending the impression of danger, especially thanks to the sound effects, and I felt like it was hopeless for anyone to escape the thing. The cinematography is quit gripping at certain points, such as the scene on the outskirts of a Resistance base that involves a burning treeline, a helicopter crash, and a nice scene done in a nearby pool of water. Even the scenes involving air combat are quite well done and do not go over the top at all, they run at a pace that is completelly realistic and exciting at the same time. The sets and imagery used for the film are all very well done I think, much moreso than a post-apocalyptic film like Resident Evil 3. They use a slight grain fliter in the camera work, but it is never overbearing. It is varied as well as shown in the final section of the film that takes place in an environment that is juxtaposed to the bleak wastelands that the Resistance calls home.<br /><br />I think the main thing to consider in this film is the timeline in which it takes place. As odd as it is, this film presents less advanced technology in terms of the termninators and weapons used by the resistance than the first two, but I think it is done for continuity to keep with the idea that this is not yet the future where Connor is shown in T2.<br /><br />There are certainly a couple of instances in the film that bugged me in terms of believablity, but they are minor enough for them to not ruin the rest of the film for me. The story could have been fleshed out somewhat more, but again, this isn't meant to be the endall of the franchise and I don't expect them to reinvent the wheel in terms of what the story actually is. There is a story in this film, and it is given to you in fair doses and paced well between action sequences. To say there is no story in the film is rather ignorant. Story is dilemma and John Connor most certinaly has a large Dilemma in the film. There can be no film without a story and this film is no different.<br /><br />This film will please many action film lovers as it is a great one, but it is not just an \\"action film\\". It is what you make of it folks and I went in with an open mind and left the theater(as did my wife) loving the film for what it was. The film could never outdo T2, not many can, but this is a different time for filmmaking and it is done well within those confines. I am actually quite excited for the next film and hope they up the anty quite a bit in both story and visual effects, but only time will tell.film could never outdo T2, not many can, but this is a different time for filmmaking and it is done well within those confines.

And what odd thing do most successful hockey players have in common?<br /><br />Gladwell has a theory that behind everyone's success story there is a \\"real story\\" of opportunity, timing, upbringing and/or culture that paved the way, and he uses it to answer these questions and more.<br /><br />This is a quick and entertaining read (except for the last chapter about his mother - which I found just tedious)- but it's not a self-help book. Many of the factors of success he identifies (outside of working very hard and long to be the best) aren't something you can control too well.<br /><br />It is, however, a great book for any curious mind or trivial information junkie!  You'll definitely enjoy this one if you enjoyed [[ASIN:0061234001 Freakonomics [Revised and Expanded]: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything]]<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Great, entertaining read for those who like to explore ideas. Read it, and I'll bet you end up telling a friend at least one of his theories and examples!
B001FB55HG|4.0|I just seen this film and was a little worried about the PG13 rating but it did deliver. It takes 15 years after Judgement Day & stars Christian Bale as a great John Connor when I herd that Christian Bale was going to be in it Iknew it was going to be decent but didn't expect somthing very good Bryace Dallas Howard esily replaces Claire Danies from T3 I was worried about the use of CGI for the T 101 but they did a good job making Rolland Kickanger look like the Terminator from 1984 when Arnold was in that Role Anthony Yelchin plays Kyle Reese in his teens but he's no Michel Biehn but was pretty solid in the role Michel Ferris & JD Brancato wrote the script I think it had some cliche moments and recognises T1 & T2 a lot but they hit the mark the Story is there's this good terminator Marcus Wright played by Sam Worthington and he donated his body to Skynet while on Death row but he comes back 15 years later as a Terminator and he sees LA has been destroyed he meets a young man named Kyle Reese.
B001N26GFM|4.0|Good movie with a horrific ending. While a lot of reviewers had problems with the factual events - \\"how is it possible that the little jewish boy can sit at the fence unobserved\\", etc.,REMEMBER - this is a MOVIE, not a documentary.  If you are easily depressed, this is not a movie to watch and I certainly would not recommend it for children under 10.
B00003CXBH|5.0|The more I see this film the more I like it. First off, it has magnificent South American jungle scenery, filmed in an area that features multiple gorgeous falls. This is one of the prettiest films you will ever watch - guaranteed.      \\"The Mission\\" won the Oscar for Best Cinematography in 1986 and that award was well-deserved. There is just one stunning scene after another.  I can only hope it gets a sharp Blu-Ray treatment someday. Then it will really look awesome!    The story is very interesting, too: a supposed true-life account what happened back in the 1700s when a few dedicated priests tried to bring Christianity to the natives. It shows what occurred when a combination of the Catholic Church and the Portugese slave-traders and politicians attempted to put a halt to their missionary. This is a drama, not an \\"action film,\\" but the movie has extended violent ending, and sometimes is shocking in that finale.    Jeremy Irons, as the dedicated Jesuit who heads the mission, and Robert De Niro in a surprise role as the killer slave-trader-turned-repentant priest are both excellent in their leading roles. It was interesting to see a young Liam Neeson, too.    To some, the story might be a bit slow I found it very involving. After several viewings, I began to fully appreciate to lush score by Ennio Morricone. This is simply one of the prettiest and classiest movies I've seen and it's highly recommended.
B001FB55HG|5.0|Wow let me tell you, I just got back from seeing this movie with my beloved family -  A wife & 2 kids (we had to leave the dog at home!

0375836675|5.0|Read this book.  It's funny, tender, sad, heartwarming, ridiculous, scary, and wonderful.  It's also wise, and has some very important things to say about life and how we choose to live it.  Don't read the spoiler  reviews--just pick up the book and start reading.  It's so well-written.  I am a new Marcus Zuzack fan.  And if you have never read the Book Thief---read that one too.  They are both the kind of books that when you finish, you take a deep breath, pull yourself together, and call a friend who likes to read, so you can tell him/her about this fabulous book that they have GOT TO READ.  He's just that good at writing.  Go! Read!
B000FCKBCU|4.0|This book was a lovely summer love story that, while predictable, still sweet. With hilarious comic relief and a steamy love making session, Sophie Kinsella has done it again.
B00005JKG9|5.0|This movie is one of the most underrated I know of. The cast is among the best ever assembled. Every time I watch it,I see more of the penetrating insights it contains.
B001TODCII|4.0|I watched TAKEN with some friends last night and enjoyed the movie.  It's fast-moving, slick, driving entertainment.  The cast is great, especially Liam Neeson as an ex-CIA operative doting on a teen daughter he never really knew.<br /><br />But I was trying to reconcile how Americans can love a movie like this so much (where a former CIA operative beats with extreme prejudice, tortures with extreme prejudice and kills with extreme prejudice) and yet turn all kinds of squeamish and hand-wringing when it comes to dealing with real-life terrorists really trying to kill us.<br /><br />Does it have to be your daughter before you care?  Would you trust Liam Neeson to do the waterboarding?  Is it easy to \\"pretend\\" to like this stuff in a world where it isn't \\"pretend\\"?<br /><br />Just something I wondered after listening to friends after the movie.<br /><br />But it's a cool movie.  The plot is lean and fast-moving.  The horrible crime of sexual slavery is addressed only to get the plot moving but isn't used to prick anyone's conscious, just provide a story of rescue.
6305181810|4.0|I've always really enjoyed this film, even if it is blatantly manipulative in its political correctness preaching. It's just great storytelling, regardless.    The film features a deep cast and one that puts on a great displaying acting, from the lead \\"good guy\\" Matt Damon to the lead \\"bad guy\\" Jon Voight to all the performers somewhere in the middle, headed by ambulance chaser Danny DeVito.    It's not a believable story at all - a rookie lawyer fresh out of school outsmarting a team of proved veterans with big money backing them - but it makes for a good story. Everyone likes to root for David against Goliath, which is what this turns out to be. Just one example, by the way, of the political correctness in here: the kid lawyer's hopes of a fair trial only become reality after the older, obviously-corrupt white judge suddenly dies and is replaced by Harvard- educated black judge (Danny Glover, of all people). Now, as it's quickly demonstrated in the film, a man of Liberal sensibilities will be bring fairness and justice to this case!    The story is not flattering to lawyers, but it's not all-condemning either. It's pretty balanced in that regard. There's not much profanity, either. Damon does very well in this choice role and once again demonstrates why he was considered one of the best in the crop of today's younger actors back in this mid-to-late `90s period.      It helps that he portrays an extremely likable character, who not only sticks up for a poor, neglected family against a big, wealthy corporation but rescues a sweet woman (Clarie Danes) from her physically-abusive husband at the same time! Wow, he does it all: SuperLawyer!    Danes is very appealing as the battered wife who winds up being romanced by Damon. That part of the film is not distracting, but a nice break from the legalese of the main story. It helps make the movie even more involving. There is very little \\"action\\" in here but not much is needed to keep one's attention since it is so entertaining for the full 2-plus hours.
0061120073|4.0|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn captures the life of the Nolan family, who live in the slums of Brooklyn, not by choice, but because they are poor. The book follows them from the opening of the 20th century through the 1920s. The central character here is Francie, the daughter of Katie and Johnny, opening when she is 11, and follows her through her teenage years.    The book is a coming-of-age novel, but at the same time, it's a look at many issues prevalent at the time which one could argue are still prevalent now. For example, beyond the immediate effects of poverty on Francie's family's life, the author has also reflected on how people both on the inside and outside of the Nolan's community viewed poverty. There is a great scene where Francie and her brother went to a \\"celebration for the poor of all faiths\\" (211) -- where the kids received little gifts, watched a play, etc., and then there was a give away of a doll. The woman gives a speech about the child giving away the doll, saying that \\"Little Mary is a very rich little girl,\\" who had received a lot of dolls for Christmas, and wanted to give the doll to \\"some poor little Mary.\\" All of the \\"poor\\" little girls refused to own up to being named Mary, because no one wanted to be a \\"symbol of all the poor little girls in the audience\\" (212). There's also a part where Francie, who wants to become a writer and is good at it, turns in compositions about \\"poverty, starvation and drunkenness\\" which her teacher tells her are \\"ugly subjects to choose..\\" and while Francie argues that they are true, the teacher says something along the lines of well, sure, but these are not subjects to be written about. (321).    Smith also writes about the perception among many of the poor that education would lift their children out of the slums and give them a chance to have a better life than the previous generation, but at the age where they can go on to high school, many families were so poor that the kids had to get working papers to helpsupport the family, sounding the death knell of many parents' dreams to get their children out of the slums and into a better situation, further perpetuating the cycle. I could go on. Gender, geography, the role of women, these are all important themes, but I can't write forever here.    What this book is really about is hope and perseverance. At the end of my edition is a little bio of the author, and in it, the author's daughter notes \\"She often said about 'Tree' that she didn't write it the way it was, but the way it should have been.\\" I think the reason this book resonates with so many people is reflected in that statement. Would we have liked it as much if she had written A Tree Grows in Brooklyn \\"the way it was?\\" Contrast this book with Ann Petry's The Street, where it was definitely written the way it was and see which you like better.    I vaguely remember reading this book as a teen, but I think my recommendation would be to older readers who are a bit more life savvy. There's a lot in this book to contemplate.
B000002GIE|4.0|Man is this record a lot of fun. The pride of Boston, MA, Extreme seemed superficially to be a typical product of the hair metal age and to be fair they did exhibit many of the cookie cutter traits of their contemporaries.  They were however not afraid to explore prog or funk which set them apart from much of the rest of the pack. They showed on their debut how much of a supremely talented foursome they were.  Nuno Bettancourt rang notice that he was a new guitar god and Gary Cherone had area ready pipes and the rhythm section of Badger and Geary completed the band, no slouches here.  Much of the subject matter of `Extreme' ran to the joyous celebration of childhood and the band showed early on that they tended to write conceptually and this would be more apparent in later releases. Van Halen seemed to be one obvious early influence especially in regards to Nuno's playing. \\"Mutha\\" is probably the most Halenesque song with its full throttle guitar intro and the style of the central riff before the chorus.  \\"Kid Ego\\", \\"Little Girls\\", \\"Wind Me Up\\" and of course \\"Teacher's Pet\\" round out my personal favorites. \\"Watching Waiting\\" is a very good power ballad type song and \\"Play With Me\\" concluded the LP at breakneck speed.  Good to great metal from the late 80's that at least gives one another flavor as opposed to the same old stuff. Extreme would gain much fame and fortune with their next record.
B0016OMFO8|5.0|I just picked this album up today, after having liked the Wilburys since '88 with their first album.  I really like this one, probably just as much as Vol. 1.  If you're a fan of them or any of the members, you'll probably love it.  Great folk rock stuff.    All the songs are good, stand out tracks being \\"Inside Out\\", \\"New Blue Moon,\\" \\"You Took My Breath Away\\" (which Carrie Fisher was thanked for in the liner notes.) There's also a great cover of Del Shannon's \\"Runaway\\" on here.  These are all very catchy.    Throughout the album, there's lots of great acoustic guitar work, and Dylan's signature harmonica playing.    The Wilburys were a great band.  If you've never heard them but are a Dylan, Petty, Harrison/Beatles fan and/or just into folk rock, I highly recommend checking them out.  No other band has compared to the mix of such legends.

With little in the way of bonus content, it is still a decent buy for the price.  Buy this if you don't own the dvd, but consider holding off for a special edition if you already own it on dvd.

B0011ZNAIC|5.0|Barry, a smart young Bee, gets out of the bee hive and visits a human city where he interacts with a girl who saved his life. Of course we learn later that bees can talk, however they agreed in between them that they should not talk to humans, lol.     Barry walks around with this human girl only to realize that humans are taking advantage of the honey that the bees have worked so hard to produce. He decides to sue the Honey selling company, and wins the case.     Barry requests that all honey is returned to the bees, which causes the bees to stop working and causes the flowers to weaken. Eventually he convinces all the bees to work again in order to save all the beautiful flowers.     Also at the end we realize that you can land a jumbo jet using the bee landing techniques, lol.      Funny and very entertaining. Certainly a great family movie

B001P3SA94|4.0|The movie tells a good story and gets at many of the critical elements of the blues in Chicago in America in the 1950s, which is certainly worthy of motion picture treatment. So understand that.<br /><br />But see that it does so without dealing with the fact that Chess was run by the Chess brothers. The film says `so long' to Phil Chess and focuses on Leonard Chess, who by most accounts was in fact the determined driving force behind Chess Records, the fabled label of Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry, Etta James and many others. Details subordinate to an attempt to achieve an overall truth.<br /><br />For eample, there is a common story that holds that the great Muddy Waters was in a do-rag white-painting the Chess studios at the time the Rolling Stones appeared to record there; that is not how things are depicted in this film. That story may not be true either - in any case, it might not have helped this film, which is a fairy successful music biopic, to have included such a detail.<br /><br />The reason I write this is that I started out writing a book called `Sunnyland Blues' because, in a late night kitchen chat, Sunnyland Slim somewhat disgustedly described the Chess brothers' methods of ensnaring artists. The method had to do with `giving' artists Cadillacs [clearly something at the center of `Cadillac Records'] in lieu of true royalties. Sunnyland actually introduced Mudy Waters to the Chess bros..but the film depicts things differently.<br /><br />Slim seemed to hold a respect for Chess's accomplishments. From a long-view historical perspective, what the Chess brothers did is something like a blessing - it could have been more, and it could have been more equitable.  You decide. Check out this flick.

B000E1ZBGS|1.0|First of all, I should say that I am an avid Jane Austen fan. I think she is one of the greatest authors in the English language. Making a film of this story is a privilege because of the material in the book. I loved the previous two adaptations made in Britain by the BBC, the last one from 1995 being exceptionally good. Colin Firth and Ms. Ehle were outstanding in these roles and apparently lived and breathed Darcy and Elizabeth for a whole summer. This latest adaptation doesn't even come close to the standards in the BBC version. It seemed as though this version tried to be different from the 1995 version, and failed as a result because this required a departure from the book.<br /><br />I found the acting surprisingly awful. Mr. Darcy in the 2005 adaptation lacked conviction, and seemed to be bored with the role he was supposed to be playing, when he wasn't trying to stay awake. Colin Firth was far more convincing. The other characters were almost as bad, including Ms. Knightley. The silly 20th Century smirks and childish behaviour, just didn't translate to the period of time that the book deals with. Jane Austen's great lines and dialogue were replaced with many 21st Century lines which although at times funny, didn't fit with the period. I do not understand why the Bennet family was made to appear very rural and poor. They were not poor in the book, but quite well to do. Like Shakespeare such modern adaptations can work, but this one was difficult to fathom. I look forward to seeing another Pride & Prejudice adaptation, but the 1995 version is the gold standard to which they will need to be compared, and not this version.<br /><br />Some positive points:<br /><br />Great CD with wonderful music. I loved it.<br /><br />Great packaging and extra materials.
B001E2JNA6|5.0|We have had the original P & P for many years. When I first got the Blu Ray player I was amazed at how the DVD looked so much better. I debated buying it in Blu-Ray, I mean afterall how much better can it look? Bought it anyhow and was truly amazed at the SIGNIFICANT difference! Colors are much more vibrant. Utterly astounding. Buy it, you won't regret it.
0757302661|2.0|if it wasn't for the breathing and the talk about staying calm and focused, I'd give this book 1 star. Its terrible. What's sad is that I agree hospitals do get it wrong for most standard pregnancies. However I dislike the anti medical establishment that runs through the book and I greatly detest the implication that if you don't succeed at the methods in this book its your fault for not trying hard enough. She really glosses over anything that could go wrong and when she does confront it she blames the hospitals for everything. Or the mother. She seems to forget that in the good ol' days, a lot of women actually died in child birth. And in fact a lot of women still do. I really do think that the method was designed to simply sell the birthing classes.<br /><br />For an infinitely better book on natural birthing, read anything by Ina May.
B000J103PC|5.0|Oh, I am sure I will ruffle some feathers calling it \\"One of the most perfect comedies ever made,\\" but that is my opinion. Let's look at what goes into a great film:  Great Dialogue: Check  Great Performances: Check (anyone who disagrees on this one is an idiot)  Original Story: Check  Great Theme: Check  Good Art Direction: Check  and MAKES YOU LAUGH: CHECK    This handles dialogue beautifully, presents interesting arguments (both sides) about the world of fashion, and  Meryl Streep's performance is deceptively complex... she is brilliant, as are many of her co-stars. This is a first-class film that makes you feel good. After a bad day at work, this is one of the films I love to pop in the DVD player!    One of my all-time favorites!
B000W4KT64|4.0|I enjoyed this but after reading some of the reviews I think I'd better check out the original John Waters film---I might like that better.  Having not seen that nor the stage version I had nothing to compare this with so I just took it as it came, and I liked it.  The cast was surprisingly good.  Christopher Walken is always very watchable; here is he cast as a relatively weak man and that's sometimes hard to do and still have it be interesting.  His dance duet with Travolta as Edna on the back porch is really lovely.  I kept thinking how much fun they must have had.    Much has been said, pro and con about Travolta.  Since I didn't see Divine or the guy who did such a good job on stage, I can't compare.  I really liked him and thought his decision to play Edna \\"straight\\" was a wise one...I found myself thinking that this was a real person, Edna, not a guy playing a woman.  It probably would be a lot easier to go for camp but I liked what he did with it...made the character genuinely sympathetic.  He was also very funny and I tended to watch him no matter who else was in the scene.  OK, his accent wasn't perfect but he was the only one who at least attempted a Baltimore accent and at times he got it.    Michelle Pfeiffer was beautiful in a thankless role as the stereotyped up-tight White ex-Beauty queen. Queen Latifah was also beautiful as the steotyped warm hearted Black woman. Allison Janney plays another steotype--the cruel White Bible thumper.  (egad...all these stereotypes!!)  I might be the only person on the planet who got a little tired of Nikki Blonsky's one-dimensional role and I was at least glad she didn't win the Miss Hairspray contest.  Another stereotype---the fat girl with the heart of gold who wins the cute guy...not very realistic and why didn't she fall for a nice nerdy guy?  No, she wanted the cutie...so is she superficial or what?  Well....if you don't get too caught up in all the Messages that the film is trying to force at you, and just enjoythe energy and dancing, this is not a bad way to spend two hours.  (I wanted to correct my rating to three stars but couldn't figure out how to do it.)

B00005RHGK|1.0|There's probably little more that could be done to make this the dumbest horror film ever.    A pair of siblings are driving along a lonely road and are almost run off it by a strangely looking super fast truck. Later they see the truck by a church and someone throwing what looks like wrapped up bodies down a hole in the ground.    Why there's a body dumping ground near an interstate is the first of many dumb plot points. Why the guy dumping bodies is doing so in daylight, only to chase after them and then, after running them off the road, continues on.    The siblings don't think it's a good idea to go to the cops but to go back to the site and see what was happening. Do they consider that anyone else might be around there. No. The girl says she won't be getting out of the car, but that's precisely what she does. The guy says he only wanted to look down the hole but he insists on his sister holding his feet as he dangles down the hole. They're trying to pack in so many dumb things here it's amazing.    The film only gets worse.
B001AVEJ1Y|1.0|Ussually I don't mind if the roles of characters are pased onto a new cast in a movie or television series, so long as they keep true to what made the show special.  For example: When the new Battlestar Galactica came out on SCI-FI, I was at first a little skeptical, but decided to give it a chance to see what it could do.  To my surprise, I was most pleased with the changes.  I decided to employ this same technique with the new Star Trek.  I was NOT pleased with the results and I'm starting to believe Hollywood is getting desperate.      First off, let me talk about the characters.  Though I admit that the director selected a cast that resembles the old characters, I do not think he portrayed them well.  If anything, the script was beyond cheesy and hard to believe.  There were several instances in the movie where I wondered \\"who talks like this?\\".  For example, the test Kirk was trying to pass, was completely chesey.  Kirk was just to arogant.  The scene would have probably worked if Kirk acted serious and played out the test, and then gave a smug smile to his bewildered superiors after he passed.  Instead, the director gave him an apple.  Who eats an apple while taking a military excercise?      Another quarel I had was the scenery.  Though the staff had done a pretty good job with the bridge of the Enterprise, that's all they worked on.  Nero's ship was a complete mess where I could not tell what was what.  Also, you would think that there would be \\"walkways\\" between all the open platforms.  The Enterprise engine room was especially degrating.  The set was nothing more then the inside of a brewery with a radioactive label slapped on a tank.  To add insult to injury, I only saw one or two engineers per scene in the engine room.  Hello.  Radioactive material.  Antimatter.  Things that make the ship fly!  Who's managing all that?  Better yet, how are they controlling what happens inside?  They could have at least put some computer consoles inside to show how the engines are maintained.  Even a warp core would do (yes, the original star trek had a warp core.  The engine room was on top of it).    And the biggest problem: theme.  Every previous Star Trek film dealt with theme that focused on what it means to be human.  For example:  Star Trek 1: Needidng some one for support (V'ger needed guidance).  Stat Trek 2: Revenge (Khan wanting vengeance)  Star Trek 3: The value of friendship (Kirk doing what ever it took to get Spock back)  Star Trek 4: The desire to be home (the crew's main objective was to return home, even though they were criminals)  Star Trek 5: Exploring a person's faith  Star Trek 6: How some people fear the future  Star Trek Generations: The desire to have a family and make a difference.  Star Trek First Contact: Revenge (Picard wanting to destroy the Borg.  Unlike Khan, Picard learned the error in his ways)  Star Trek Insurection: Focused on a part of our history when cowboys forced Indians off their land.  Star Trek Nemesis: Explores the differences between someone who aspires to be more and someone who does not.    Star Trek 2009: ?????.  I have no clue.  The characters didn't learn anything or make any changes.  No lessons on humanity or definitions that show us what makes us human.  Just kill the bad guy and save the world.    All in all, this is not Star Trek.  Only the title says otherwise.  No effort was really made to focus on characteriztion or plot of the story.  Call it something else, but don't call it Star Trek.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Even though (as of the time of this writing) you can still watch Dr. Horrible online for free, and can download it for a song, there are two very important reasons why you must get the DVD:  First, sales of the DVD help to cover the costs of production (including the salaries of the cast and crew).  There's already talk of a Dr. Horrible sequel in the works; so, if you want to insure that high-quality independent productions like Dr. Horrible continue to get made, you need to support the producers by buying the DVD.  Second (and more importantly, from your perspective), you've got to buy the DVD for the special features.  As you might expect, there are featurettes about the making of Dr. Horrible, and a very entertaining (and often hilarious) commentary track featuring the entire cast, all of the writers, and the director, discussing the making of Dr. Horrible.  There are also some \\"Easter Eggs\\" that you can hunt for.  But the real treats are: \\"Commentary: The Musical\\" and the Evil League of Evil (ELE) application videos.  As the name suggests, \\"Commentary: The Musical\\" is a second commentary track (again featuring the entire cast, all of the writers, and the director); but, instead of just talking about the making of Dr. Horrible, this time they actually SING about it.  And the songs on \\"Commentary: The Musical\\" are actually very good.  In my opinion, they are almost as entertaining as the songs in the Dr. Horrible musical itself.  In fact, I've still got some of the songs from \\"Commentary: The Musical\\" stuck in my head.  As for the ELE application videos, I was reluctant to watch them at first, assuming that they would be cheesy amateur videos sent in by fans.  But I was amazed to discover that they were all very well done, very professional, and very entertaining.  Do not pass up the opportunity to watch the ELE application videos.<br /><br />I haven't said much about Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog itself, because I am assuming that, if you're considering buyingthis DVD, you must already be a fan of the musical.  After all, as I have already mentioned, Dr. Horrible is still available for free online viewing.  So, if you haven't seen it yet, go watch it (it's available at Hulu), then come back here and order the DVD.  In case you've never heard of Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog, it is a tragicomedy musical about a hapless supervillain (Dr. Horrible, played by Neil Patrick Harris), his superhero arch-nemesis (Captain Hammer, played by Nathan Fillion), and the woman they both love (Penny, played by Felicia Day).  It was created, co-written, and directed by Joss Whedon (the genius behind Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Firefly, Serenity, and Dollhouse).  I would go into more detail; but no description of Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog can do it justice.  You've just got to go watch it and see for yourself.
1582701709|1.0|When I was first introduced to this concept by a former \\"good\\" friend of mine, I was intrigued.  But I have discovered that this is a hateful book and philosophy.  I am a breast cancer survivor, and have lost friends who believed this book TOTALLY.  To think that people believe cancer or any other disease is like a common cold, only transferrable by thought or association, not deed, is deplorable in this day and age.  My \\"once upon a time\\" friend truly believes that if I even say the word cancer, use my experience to help more recent cancer survivors, visit patients after surgery in the hospital, read up on new treatments and better nutrition and exercise, and share my knowledge and experience with others is detrimental to me and I think of more concern, to her.  I believe her premise is that saying the word \\"cancer\\" is rather like the old pink elephant example, where just to think it brings it into your life.  You know, if you think it, you will get it.  \\"The Secret\\" recommends that you isolate yourself from illness in others, and let the medical field deal with it.  How easy is a life like that, if you isolate yourself from the life trials of others.  This book merely gives people who are fearful of dreadful diseases the crutch to blame others and isolate themselves from people going through difficult times in their lives.  How can anyone believe this stuff?  It is cruel and deplorable.  She is not longer my friend because I am the sum of all my life's adventures, not the Typhoid Mary of breast cancer.  If the section in the book on dealing with illness is the author's idea of positive thinking, let someone else read it.  Then when they get a disease like cancer, AIDS, diabetes or other diseases which invoke superstitious fear in others, they can experience the rejection of their friends and loved ones too.  So much for compassion.
0618918248|4.0|I'll try and make this short and sweet. \\"The God Delusion\\" should be a required read for theists and atheists alike as it does answer many questions, but it should not be one's only source when trying to determine whether there is a higher being. I doubt it will convert many believers to non-believers, but it surely will enlighten them. This wouldn't be a bad place to start if one wants to learn about the arguments for and against the existence of God/gods, but one should really base their decision on more than a single book. I suggest balancing \\"The God Delusion\\" with a more scientific approach along with an historical examination of one's holy text. For the latter, I found \\"Is Christianity True?\\" to be a good concise assessment of the Gospels.    Final word: Read it! Worth the money and time.
0312944098|5.0|Prisoner of Birth is the best book by Archer and one of the best I have read in a long time.  I simply could not put down this book till the end... The flow is great and there is never a dull moment. You want to keep reading to find out what happens next. It does not bore you with too many legal details which a Grisham book surely does. I would recommend this book to all!!!!
0307474275|1.0|It is difficult for me to imagine  how this book ever became a world renown best-seller. Ther is absolutely nothing in it which would be of interest to an average intelligent person. The so called sensation is hard to conceive and attempts to be inresting are too weak. I undesrtand that ther exist an either sequel or pre-quel? Good luck!
1569242739|5.0|Okay, I'm gonna add my two cents to other 211 people who have given this little gem of a book a 5-star review.  Let me first start by saying that I am somewhat obsessed with cupcakes and love to bake.  I am not a vegan but my husband is and thus I generally make everything vegan.  Over the years, I found myself buying all the trendy \\"it\\" baking books, Magnolia, etc.... only to be repeatedly disappointed in my attempts to \\"veganize\\" a non-vegan recipe.  I could generally succeed at making a chocolate recipe, but forget vanilla.  As all we vegan bakers know, the egg replacer would help bind the recipe, but the rising was ALWAYS an issue.  I'd have to fill the whole damn cup with batter because it would never rise.  No egg, no rise......until.....NOW!  I'm still trying to wrap my brain around the chemistry of how these little gems can be made without egg replacer, but they can!!! Follow the directions and you'll end up with perfect little cupcakes every time.      Please also read the foreword to the book.  There are many helpful little nuggets in there regarding the whys and hows of ingredients, bake temperatures, peeking while baking and troubleshooting.      I am so completely impressed with this book I can't begin to tell you.  Yes, you can make delicious tasting and way cool looking cupcakes that are vegan that will delight your taste buds and impress just about everyone around.  I challenge anyone to discover these little yummy things are vegan....they're that good.

0671449028|5.0|All of my kids love her books. We read them daily and own almost all of them. Our three and five year olds practice their 'reading' by reciting them over and over again to the baby. They are cute, happy and well done. As a parent, I never grow tired of reading them as with some other authors. Two thumbs up!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I read that this game was addicting, but I had no idea.  If you like board games, you REALLY need to purchase this game.  The pros to this game are: even though the \\"how to play the game\\" booklet is huge, it REALLY is easy to learn; the booklet shows you the easy way to learn the game - and it even has a link to view video instruction on-line (which is very nice!); once you learn the basics, you can change the game to make it more challenging and a totally different game each time you play; in addition there are expansion packs available!  The big con-side is that the game suggests a minimum of three players and a maximum of four players for the game without any expansion packs.  I usually only have one other person available...so we either take turns being the \\"third player\\" or we just play the game with the two of us - it is not as much fun (the 3rd person really adds to the challenge of the game), but we still have a great time!  The dynamics of the game really are best with 3 to 4 players.  The game itself is made of a very sturdy hardboard/cardboard, but we play SO much that we have squshed the corners of some of the pieces (we are hard on games).  The game will still last us many more years of enjoyment, though, because the pieces are sturdy.  I love this game because we can make it as challenging as we want and it never goes \\"on-and-on-and-on\\" - the game booklet claims the game can be played in about an hour, and no lie, no matter how challenging we make it, the game lasts almost exactly one hour.  Then we can play again or stop for the evening.  We can make it super easy (play for less points or give ourselves a 'city' to begin with, for eaxmple) if we only have a half an hour.    The Settlers of Catan is a fun game.  It teaches cooperation, deal-making, strategy, and planning by giving you \\"resources\\" that you can use in a number of ways to win...there is no totally \\"right\\" or totally \\"wrong\\" way....just like life, there are so many paths we can take to thesame end result and so many ways to \\"win\\" ....

1401207529|2.0|Only four issues long, this is meant to tell the story of Batman's formative year. I went into this riding high on the wave of adulation for this work and came away feeling cheated and like I'd gotten screwed with my pants still on. There are some inspired moments but mostly I was asking the question, \\"Yeah, okay, interesting - but when's the freaking story gonna start??!\\" Its not enough to say \\"It's Millar, shut up\\" or \\"Its untouchably masterfully brilliant!!\\" cos it really isn't. Compared to other Batman stories - basically anything Denny O'Neill wrote, Venom, Long Halloween, Hush etc - Year One falls down. Over-hyped with some good ideas but no real payoff.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|First, I am an avid fan of Charlaine Harris and her Sookie series.  I really didn't know what to expect from the show.  Would they capture the humor of the books?  The essence of Sookie?  Would I feel I was visiting friends for a nice cold glass of iced tea as I do when I read the books?  Well I bought the series, never having saw one episode and I can say that YES it does all I wanted it to an more.  The filming, music, and imagery is top notch, draws you in before the story even starts.  Sure there are changes from the book.  Tara being one, but GOD how I love this NEW Tara!  The show can't be the books, that just isn't possible.  But it is as good as the books, believe me, an avid fan!  There are changes, and I am sure there will continue to be changes, frankly, I don't WANT the series to follow the books faithfully.  This show stands on its OWN merit, which says a lot, being that is based on a series I love.  I don't feel any fan of dark humor, supernatural themes, or quirky shows will go wrong with this one.  Some have complained about the sex and nudity....did you read the books?  Jason IS a horn dog, we just weren't in HIS head when he was doing it!!  The actors/actresses do a fantastic job of bringing our beloved characters to life as do the writers!!  Kudos to the entire team of True Blood and I look forward to Season 2 and many more!!
0141439513|5.0|The manuscript for Jane Austen's best novel, originally titled First Impressions, was rejected and returned to the author. After some revisions, the novel was published as Pride and Prejudice. It has remained one of english literature's most popular novels.  Pride and Prejudice did have its share of critics, perhaps one of the most notable of those critics was Charlotte Bronte, author of Jane Eyre, who called Austen's novel a disappointment. I wager many people would heartily disagree.<br /><br />Even people who have never read Pride and Prejudice have heard the names Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy. The main protagonists of the novel have become trademarks of the British Regency era. In the novel, Lizzy and Mr Darcy appear to be the epitome of opposites. Upon their first encounter, Elizabeth Bennet believes herself perfectly aquainted with Mr Darcy's character and hopes she will never find herself in his miserable presence again. The phrase \\"don't judge a book by its cover\\" aptly applies to Mr Darcy.<br /><br />Pride and Prejudice is one of the finest novels I have ever read. I love it not only for the romance (which is unparalleled), but also for its humor. The televised adaptations of this novel, some dating back to 1940, are excellent. The BBC version starring Colin Firth, and the 2005 movie starring Keira Knightley are amazing.  I don't think I could pick a favorite if my life depended on it. If I had to be stranded on an island with just one book, it would be Pride and Prejudice. If I could dream a fictional character to life, it would be Mr Darcy. Pride and Prejudice, an unforgettable book filled with unforgettable characters.
B001ECQ6YW|5.0|I've watched five times by now, but I keep appreciated hidden little things from the movie. The story is so good, just like old kungfu stories I have read in my childhood. Animation graphics is so awesome with very real action moves. Don't know if Jackie Chan shares his ideas and action direction, but it's as is from his movie signatures. Very good moves, most of them are real fighting moves.  This is one enjoyable movie for the whole family. Highly recommend to all. Can't wait for the sequence!!

B001RTP3Z0|5.0|I am a big fan of Leonard Cohen so I naturally bought this. I was surprised at the quality. Usually a live concert is no where near as good as the album. Because usually an albun is processed so that any mistakes or imperfections are edited out. But at 76 Leonard sounds as good if not better than he was 16 years ago. I loved it so much that I bought the cd and the dvd. I have listened to it non stop for 2 weeks stoping only to go to work and clean my house. If you have never heard Cohen then you should. A friend at work heard my cd and she loved it and she said how is it that I haave never heard of him before I am 54 just like you. Well My only regret is that he has not chosen to tour the usa. Maybe he will one day. My husband has seen him in concert years ago and I am so jealous. Hey you can't take your money with you, and even in the troubling times facing us his music brings such joy and peace.
076790592X|5.0|great book.  shipped quickly.  my mother loves mitch albom and really enjoyed this novel as a gift.
B00133KHCY|1.0|I ordered this product (a great movie) and it was never delivered.  The mechant claimed it was rejected at the delivery point which is not likely since I had it delivered to my work address (it was a surprise for my wife's birthday).  Failed transaction lead to a no sale.  Go figure...
B001TODCII|1.0|Remembering Liam Neeson in \\"Schindler's List\\", this picture is several notches down for him.  The plot is mindless and the writing amateurish.  For openers, the character of his daughter is portrayed as a selfish, unappreciative, spoiled brat for whom I would have trouble leaving the house to rescue.    After his rich characterisation of Oskar Schindler, Neeson's speech over the phone, threatening the kidnapper, is embarrassing.    As a whole the picture is contrived, predictable and completely unbelievable.
B0000WN0ZK|2.0|This movie, which was considered terribly trendy and profound when first released, doesn't date well at all. The story of a fashion photographer who thinks he's witnessed a murder in a park is much less than meets the eye.<br /><br />There are holes in the plot as big as the Grand Canyon -- for example, when the photog returns to the park, thinking he may find a body there, he doesn't take a camera with him! And when he drops in on a rock concert, the audience is sitting absolutely still, like so many statues -- this is supposed to tell us something about alienation, or whatever.<br /><br />The film seems interminable, but it finally does end --- with the famous tennis scene, which is played by mimes, without rackets or a ball (insert joke here). Like the rest of the movie, it's pretentious hooey.<br /><br />The commentary track is almost as bad. There is a great deal of talk about illusion vs. reality, and Antonioni's use of color, and whether the script is politically correct, and the artist's function in society, and on, and on, and on.<br /><br />The sequence that gives the film its name -- the blow up of pictures taken of what may have been a killing -- is skillfully done, but, like almost everything else in this movie, it goes on too long.<br /><br />Viewed now, this film, which caused such a sensation in its day, is a huge disappointment.<br /><br />In fairness, I should note that the young Vanessa Redgrave is wonderful, but she can't carry the whole movie.
B001RIY4WE|1.0|As others have pointed out this won't play on even a newer Blu Ray player.  I have a 6 month old Pioneer with the latest firmware update and it will eventually (try 20 minute load time) play the audio only!  The disc is going back to Amazon.
B001TH16DS|5.0|Having been born in the 70s, I didn't get to see the Star Trek series during its original run. I totally loved the movies as a teenager. I watched ST:TNG, Deep Space Nine, and some of Voyager, but I never really watched the original series.<br /><br />Having purchased a PS3 for Blu Ray movies, I thought I should plunk down some hard earned change and get the original series. All I can say is \\"WOW.\\" This show looks fantastic in HD, and it sounds very good as well. The updated visual effects brings you into the action more than some guy holding a cardboard cut out of a planet. The new exterior shots of the Enterprise look great as well, and the updated audio track sounds sonic. I get goose bumps when I hear Alexander Courage's Star Trek theme during the opening credits.<br /><br />Fantastic job from CBS/Paramount (or whoever is responsible). Any Star Trek fan with a Blu Ray player owes it to himself to pick this first season up!!!
B001FB55HG|2.0|I am sad to say Director McG destroyed this franchise. His casting was terrible. Christian Bale is a great edgy character actor. He could not sell the audience he is the kind hearted John Connor. Bale should have been the Terminator. Sam Worthington would have been a better choice as John Connor. McG story telling at best was confusing. The story was all over the place with weak dialog. The visual effects looked great but they did not help tell the story. They actually made it more confusing because most of the time they had no purpose. His many battle scenes went on so long that they became boring. McG put in a lot of nonsense. Example, Connor has a piece of iron the size of a 2x4 plunged in to his chest that protrudes out his back. The next scene he is on the operating table looking like he was there for a yearly check up and the doctor say I think he has a bad heart. The movie is bad, boring, ridiculous and a big disappointment. Not even a good rental.
B00007ELEL|5.0|The individual DVD arrived very efficiently and in perfect condition. \\"The Big Lebowski\\" is one of my favorite movies and I'm glad to finally own it. The only complaint is that the \\"menu\\" - such as it was - consisted of two options for viewing the film (widescreen or full screen) and nothing else. Otherwise, the disc was in great condition and I recommend the seller highly.

B001U0HBPG|5.0|I didn't see this one at the movies cause it was getting mixed reviews but I must say that once I got the DVD I liked it very much.    Brad's acting is brilliant and worthy of all the praise he got for it and Cate is amazing (she always is)
B0000ADY9I|5.0|This is the music that motivated me to play the guitar, along with countless others. To think Duane was just 23 yrs old is astonishing. His passion and sense of urgency are matched only by his technique! BLUES AT ITS ELECTRIC BEST !!! This album and Otis Redding \\"Live in Europe\\" are the standards for live recordings.
B000GCFO0S|4.0|For a truly unique film experience check out \\"Silent Hill\\". As a fan of the games I expected to be impressed but anyone looking for innovative filmmaking and extraordinary (WOW) production design should find this film fascinating. I am firmly convinced that Gans and Avery have hit a home run here.     For those who have never seen the game, \\"Silent Hill\\" is the best ever survival/ horror game series. It is difficult and confusing (a lot of mazes and D&D-like details) so expect major disorientation at times during the film-which is a bit like actually playing the game.     The acting was convincing, the editing extraordinary, and the atmosphere oppressive. Not 100% how I visualized it before viewing but even the differences tended to work in favor of the film.     The town itself looked and actually felt familiar, unlike the mess they made of \\"House of Wax\\". This is definitely the sort of film best seen on the big screen with a theater sound system. Everyone should be totally creeped out.     Enough said, more at this stage might spoil things so read on only if you have already seen the film or if you don't mind some spoilers.     Dahlia Gillespie had a daughter (by an unknown father) named Alessa. Alessa became the town outcast until a bunch of religious nuts (led by Christabella) decided she was a witch and must be sacrificed to keep evil out of Silent Hill. Dahlia went along with this because she was afraid of her own damnation for having the child. But the ceremony went wrong and the nutcases were not just killed but sent to a netherworld between heaven and hell.     The dark side of Alessa ended up in the same place but she was split into duel entities and the good part stayed in the normal world where she was adopted by Rose and Chris, and named Sharon. Sharon's sleepwalking is caused by her connection with Alessa who wants her to return to Silent Hill.     On the way to Silent Hill, Rose and Sharon arouse the suspicions of a motorcycle policewoman (Cybil Bennett). This happens because Cybil has been extremely protective of children since she saved a little boy from a psychopath. Cybil follows them to Silent Hill (once a coal mining town that was abandoned because of a burning seam of coal under the town). At the town limits a mysterious girl appears and both vehicles crash. When Rose and Cybil regain consciousness Sharon is gone.     As they explore the abandoned buildings they discover a church with a warning siren where the religious cult hides when Alessa (presumably) causes a darkness to take over the town; for some reason the darkness and Alessa cannot enter the church. It turns out that Alessa sent her Sharon identity back into the world of the living to bring back someone (Rose) who can take her into the church where she can finally exact her revenge.     Everyone is dead in the netherworld of Silent Hill, even Rose and Cybil-they don't know it yet but they died in the accident-because you can only enter the town if you are dead. Alessa needs Rose which is why she died, it was just Cybil's bad luck to have been involved in the accident.     The tip off to their being parallel towns comes when Rose's husband Chris enters the real Silent Hill and finds nothing supernatural in the place; although he senses a connection with his wife and adopted daughter, he finds no tangible sign of them. Rose passes right through him and the ending scene of Rose and Sharon in their home is blurred, but the scene with Chris in the parallel home is completely clear.     Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.
B001FB55HG|5.0|The typical Terminator movie, this one begins at the Longview Correctional Facility in 2003 where a death-row prisoner is being asked to donate his body to a noble cause.<br /><br />Fast-forward to year 2018.  There is destruction everywhere as we see John Conner and the Resistance fighting off the human-hating terminator robots, which are manufactured by Skynet Labs.  In this flick, John Conner meets his father Conner Reed.<br /><br />Of course, I cannot tell you any more about the storyline, other than it's the usual Resistance vs. Terminators.  The Terminators (Ts) are bad and big and some are bigger than big, including flying Ts and Ts on motorcycles. As usual, it's hard as heck to stop them or kill them.  Some of them keep getting up for awhile.  The objective is to put Skynet Labs out of business and kill off the Ts, but after 2 T movies, we know that ain't so easily done.<br /><br />The movie has almost non-stop action and it gets pretty intense.  The whole concept about these big scary robots taking over and killing humanity is not a good concept for children to watch, so I would not take the young and impressionable.<br /><br />The computer graphic imaging is pretty cool and it takes up a lot of your energy to watch this movie.  It was about 2 to 2 1/2 hours long but enjoyable.  I give it a 5 for the action, graphic imaging, intensity, etc.  The storyline was basic good guys vs. bad guys and the standard T action as in the first 2 Ts.  Thoroughly enjoyable on the big screen.

0312330537|1.0|My god. What an incredible load of drivel this is. Though there is room in the world for large stories largely told, Gregory David Roberts' self-aggrandazing pseudo-autobiography teems with ludicrously bad prose, characters so flat I'd like to use them to keep water off my bathroom floor, dimwitted philosophy, and self-love. I quite literally had to stop reading from embarassment at the sex scenes (\\"my body was her chariot and she rode me into the sun\\"? ye gods), and repeatedly found myself saying, \\"No, actually\\", at Roberts' increasingly idiotic turns of simile and metaphor even outside that context.     Absolute drek.
B001VB8UAE|5.0|Fabulous concerts. I watched the CBS special and was very happy to get so much more on the DVD of that concert.  Arrowpond is one of my favorites...Barbra is truly amazing.  And the 3rd DVD showing her in the recording studio making The Broadway album was wonderful.  I enjoyed all of them.
B001TCAT9U|4.0|I purchased the deluxe set thinking it would be similar to \\"The Best of...\\" which was loaded with music videos of the past, in addition to the movie about the musicians.  Although I enjoyed the music on Sounds of the Universe, I was disappointed in the lack of music videos to go with these beautiful songs.  Not only are these guys eye candy, they create some of the most thought-provoking music videos (see Precious and Suffer Well).    On Sounds of the Universe, I particularly liked Peace and Wrong.  Both songs are reminicent of DM past and speak to me in terms of melody and lyrics.  All in all, great music, but don't waste the extra money on the deluxe set if you're looking for videos.
B0015UKX7E|5.0|The ultimate New Year's Eve 1999 party.  The party every Prince fan would have wanted to attend.  Prince is at his very very best.  He was amazing as was Larry Graham and the NPG (Rosie Gaines) and guests Lenny Kravitz - Morris Day & The Time - and other special artists & guests.  Just when you think it was over...Prince grabs you and spins you around for another ride.  He gives you his hits - he sings blues - he does rock. Since I couldn't be there LIVE;  I am so glad that I bought it. I felt like I was there. He is truly amazing...but of course......he is PRINCE..!!!!!
B00005221M|5.0|This is a outstanding movie that has it all, action, war, love, jealousy, betrayal, passion, honor, friendship, courage, sacrifice, death and sorrow, and freedom! This movie gives you a remarkable glimpse of Colonial America, and how the brave men and women, lived during these daring, and dangerous, unsettled times.<br /><br /> This is a story about the last of the Mohicans, a native american who is a very brave and honorable man who is Mohican; he has two brave, handsome sons, that he has raised to honorable manhood, except one is white who is (Daniel Day-Lewis)named Hawkeye. He loves his sons and is very proud of them both!<br /> They all get caught up in the war between the British and the French, who have Indian allies, some are bitter renegades, full of hate and betrayal, and going on killing war parties.<br /><br /> The Mohicans  help save the beautiful daughters of a British Colonial Munroe, and Hawkeye falls in love with one of them, that is named Cora. Together they go on a incredible journey across the breathtaking beauty of the forest, and waterfalls, and mountains, and splender of Colonial America, to get to the fort where the daughter's father (Colonial Munro) is trying to defend the fort, from a French takeover. Then their journey takes on a dramatic turn, that changes them forever!<br /><br />This is a great movie, I highly recommend it! The chemisty, and looks that pass between handsome Hawkeye and the very beautiful Cora is awesome and hot! I loved this movie, it had a lot of action, and it gives you a idea of how hard and uncertain it was, especially during the harsh, fighting battle scenes! And it made me sad to know that the Mohicans are a vanishing people, who will be no more part of the frontier, because of the ever increasing, changing times of Colonial America!<br /><br /> And I also loved the protective way the handsome Mohican brother, of Hawkeye watched over the other very beautiful, younger daughter of Munroe, it seemed like in a unspoken way, that they belonged together! Awesome movie! This movie was very well done! and I loved the wonderful, outstanding work of the people behind the camera lens!wesome movie! This movie was very well done! and I loved the wonderful, outstanding work of the people behind the camera lens!
0399230033|5.0|My 2 year old grandson laughed out loud when the book was read in an animated way. Delightful for me too.
B000BB1MIC|5.0|This continues to be a source of enjoyment to me with witty lines, fun situations, superb acting.  I'm so glad you were able to keep the actors, just a shame you lost the best writers.  Keep producing the best of longtime story lines.
B000SFJWLU|4.0|The best way I can describe the style of the music these guys make is Pantera meets System of a Down.  It's some of the best I've heard in a long time.  I recommend it to anyone with interests in that range.  I'd give it five stars, but it would have to blow me away to get that; four stars is a regular fixture in the CD changer.
031606792X|3.0|The beginning of the book turned out to be a decent continuation of the story.  I definately think it has adult content.  My biggest complaint is that the ending was weak.  Sure it's nice things became happily ever after but I'd like to have seen some action.  So much time was spent building up with strategy and who has what abilities that I thought there'd be more of a fight to it.  It'd be nice to have seen a battle between the voltare and the cullen crew and then throw in a resolution.  I've read many fantasy books that had just a more exciting punch in the final battle.  It was a let down to compare the end of this series with others.  Over all it was a good series to read but unfortunately when you remember a series you remember the beginning and the end mostly, how much a series grabs you and if you like the characters \\"first impressions\\" and then the end \\"exciting conclusions\\" and \\"satisfying resolutions\\".  This was missing the exciting conclusion part.
B0001O3YD0|5.0|The DC of Pitch Black is one of the best films I've ever seen. I've seen the 'normal' version a thousand times by now and I was happy to find all those scenes I haven't known yet. I can only recommend the film. And last not least ... there are really great special features!
B0017V7GLC|5.0|This is an excellent album. If you ever liked old school punky goth this is a must in your collection. It definately goes back to the roots of the genre but in a very fresh and interesting way. Full of mournful yet somehow perky notes, chords and melodies, this music carries you into a dark yet fun little nook of your mind.
B000065KLO|5.0|Hedwig is a wild ride in to the life of the leading character.  This journey is filled with razzle dazzle and great music.  More than that it is a multilayered look in to the life of Hedwig his pain and struggle.  The struggle to find and live your truth is one we all share regardless of the circumstance.  John Cameron Mitchell's performance is outstanding it is easy to see why this film had the Golden Globes paying attention.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|Last year, when I learned that a new Star Trek movie was due to be released in 2009, my heart was compounded with both eagerness...and doubt. Eager, because upon seeing the name J.J. Abrams at the helm, I knew he was going to make it great. But at the same time, I had doubt if I ever going to like the movie at all. I mean, look at Star Wars! Although I did watch the three Star Wars movies when I was a kid, I never did become an avid fan. Thanx to George Lucas for coming up with those crappy prequels (ok, so Sith was slightly better than the first two), now I kinda' hate Star Wars.    Likewise, I was never a Trekkie. Well, I may recognise some of the characters from the TV show and know what the story revolved around, but only vaguely. If The Simpsons hadn't used Leonard Nimoy as a guest voice in some of its episodes, I might not even know there was a character named Spock Prime. True, the Star Trek movies starring Patrick Stewart (who also played Professor Charles Xavier in the X-Men franchise) as Captain Jean-Luc Picard were quite recent, but they failed to attract me to become a fan.    But when I saw the trailers some months back (Trailer 3 is somewhat more touching), I knew that Abrams will be taking us for a thrill ride. My doubt was immediately replaced with uncontrollable anticipation.    Gladly, my anticipation was met with satisfaction. Heck, I dragged my wife along just to watch it again, and she too, had enjoyed it and both of us are non-Trek followers.    For most movies, they usually left me awed only when the end credits started rolling in or after I left the cinema. But for Star Trek, it made my jaw dropped even at the beginning of the movie, and my jaw continued to drop (literally) at most times throughout the movie. Yes, it is THAT good!!!    What made Star Trek such an unforgettable movie? Well, for a start - it is a fun movie and full of action right from the start - from the attack on USS Kelvin, to when younger Kirk destroys the classic car (forno apparent reason), and the fight scene between Kirk and Sulu with some bad Romulans on the drill machine, right up to the climax battle sequences. Seeing the characters running (usually to save themselves or others) for most of the time, indicates that this movie is a fast paced one and moviegoers should stay glued to the screen and in their seats - like when the 800 souls are 'fleeing' for their lives, or when Kirk rushes (with McCoy and Uhura entails behind him) to prevent the USS Entreprise from falling into the trap, or when Spock and the Vulcan elders are running out of the cave, or when Kirk is trying to save himself from being eaten by the (cool) space monsters on Delta Vega, or how about when Earth's core is being drilled from space and the Earthlings are running towards it, wondering what it is (the drill machine is a reminiscence of the Alien space craft from the Independence Day movie - with hot, fiery beam fired from the centre of the craft and the beam is protected by circular side walls. In Star Trek, it is the side wall that Sulu uses to bounce himself back up to safety).    Despite its fast pace, all the main characters (the good guys and the 'bad' ones) are properly introduced and developed - we either love them or hate them. The movie also invokes our tear 'glands'. Both Kirk and Spock lose a parent in tragic turn of events! Our hero James T. Kirk is both beaten (his dad dies, and so, he settles for a less-than-ordinary life) and got beaten up rather badly, I mean...literally. First, the bar fight, then by Spock and towards the end of the movie, by some Romulans thugs. The Romulans are headed by Nero, played by Eric Bana (Bana is clean shaven and tattoed - making him almost unrecognisable). We also feel for Spock, with personality crisis (half human/half Vulcan) and trying hard not to be emotionally compromised after witnessing the tragedy that befalls his mother (an older and taller Winona Ryder) and home planet.     In one memorable scene, Abrams brilliantly puts all the (good) characters on the bridge. Totally priceless, especially for the fans!     The movie provides good comic relief when Kirk is trying hard to get Uhura's first name, or seeing Kirk's reaction to those numerous vaccine shots, or Chekov's first scene with his accent, or Scotty and his false calculation when transporting Kirk and Spock right in the middle of the enemies.    Go watch this one! So what if you don't understand those sci-fi technical stuffs like 'external inertial damper' or you worry if you can't fully appreciate the characters. The movie calls for repeat viewing, for fans (of the Star Trek franchise) and non-fans alike. After all, the Rolling Stone calls it as a 'Pure Filmmaking Exhilaration' and 'An Irresistable Invitation For Fun', and Access Hollywood \\"The First 'Star Trek' For Everyone\\" (true indeed), and Newsweek with its simple yet accurate two-word review to sum it up - \\"Way Cool\\".    P/S: This review together with some movie stills can be found at my blog [...]
B001F290E4|2.0|Seal had me from the first note. Great disk if you love his voice and the oldy tunes.
B00009Z574|4.0|One of the things that can make or break a band like Yes are how they handle crossing over. In terms of Supertramp and Genesis in the early 80's it worked but strangely enough Yes were the first group to give it a go. You'd think that with guys like Rick Wakeman who really seem to get off on 15 minute solo's that it would be a fools arrand. But considering the success of [[ASIN:B00007LTIC Going for the One]] and a few years off had given the band the opportunity to understand it was time for a change.\\"Don't Kill The Whale\\" is pretty short and has a nice groove to it-not an uncommon thing for Yes in general but the shortness in this case really works well in this particular case,especially the keyboard.\\"Future Times\\" and \\"Release,Release\\"....well they're good,not great and pretty typical of Yes's classic sound.On \\"Arriving UFO\\",\\"Onward\\" and \\"On The Silent Wings Of Freedom\\" strech out a little bit more.\\"Circus Of Heaven\\" and \\"Madrigal\\" both return to classic themes but.....fact is,a lot of this music is rather samey.A dramatic rhythm here,anthemic vocal here-Yes's variety of prog rock really seemed to be stuck in the same old strech. Even though some of the songs are pretty good.Some of the bonus tracks really are interesting,\\"Amiliene\\" is a pretty strong rocker and \\"Money\\" (not the Pink Floyd hit by the way),with it's great satiric backround recitation....well does recall Floyd's tune of the same title with it's funky groove. \\"Countryside\\" is another great song,a very poppy tune actually. Again with the bonus cuts some of them sound a little samey but this is worth it for it's highlites.Although it's strong musically it's an example of how every lost album is not necessarily a full on lost treasure.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Superb HD video of rare sights around the globe make Planet Earth both highly entertaining and a true 'work out' for your 1080P panel & Blu-ray player. Something you will replay time & time again. Very good value at Amazon. A must have for your video collection.
B000MGATTE|5.0|my friends and i all loved this book. i can't imagine why it has three stars.
1851775722|4.0|My daughter uses both this book and the companion one for the previous century for her Fashion Design Degree course. She is delighted with both books. They exceeded our expectations and have terrific photos with the right amount of text.
B001SF8G1Q|3.0|Hailed as Dylan's return from the self-imposed oblivion of SELF PORTRAIT, this album brings us into Dylan's Woodstock paradise, where he wrote songs as babies pulled on his shoestrings. Listening again, after nearly 40 years, I was struck by how short the songs, which range across different styles, are.
B0000640VM|5.0|The dvd was in great condition and was delivered promptly...faster than I thought in fact.  As for the movie itself, it was exactly as I remembered.  A fun adaptation of Dickens' Oliver Twist in which Billy Joel carries the film as the voice of the character Dodger with some rockin and soulful tunes.  The kids loved it!
B000HEWEDK|5.0|Excellent science fiction movie. It is unquestionably a true classic.[[ASIN:B000HEWEDK Forbidden Planet (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]
B00005U122|5.0|In my teen years there were several inspiring rock bands that molded our lives. Pink Floyd was my personal favorite. When they split, I was of course devastated. I caught an opportunity to see Roger Waters \\"Pros & Cons of Hitchhiking\\" tour back in the 80s and I didn't expect much, but I was blown away. I later saw David Gilmore's version of PF and felt Roger captured the spirt of PF that I remember. This DVD pretty much let me relive that Roger Waters concert I saw so many years ago. I gave this DVD to my older brother, who was also a Pink Floyd fanatic, and he was likewise, blown away!
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I have been in the metclub for 15 years, this album was worth waiting for. And the concert blew your mind. Still rockin hard as ever.
0316017922|2.0|I bought this book because it was highly recommended by Charlie Munger, vice chair of Berkshire Hathaway. I was disappointed. The book has no practical application whatsoever. I just finished the book and still don't know what I read about. It certainly wasn't about success. I think people who buy a book that says \\"the story of success\\" are eager to learn something about the subject, well, if that's you I would recommend to look elsewhere. The last chapter in the book is about authors mother who came from Jamaica and barely made it, because of the issue of race. I just think it is useless to complain about race, it is not something one can change. Another problem was that author seems to believe that being a lawyer or a physician equals success. I work with a bunch of physicians in the hospital and I would not call them success stories, a lot of times they are plain disasters.   I did like reading chapter 7 The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes, simply because I like to look into causes of failure that lead to things like plane crashes. Gladwell showes you that even small failures compounded can lead to consequences of huge proportions like plane crashes. So that is the only part I liked. The most boring part was about Jewish immigrants(and I am an immigrant myself) selling aprons in the streets of New York, and that somehow led to their children and granchildren being succesful and extremely lucky lawyers. I barely made it through.   Gladwell's arguments are extremely weak. I felt that he was describing more extreme cases that won't happen to you.
B001KMB6X2|2.0|Vin Diesel's new sci-fi action \\"Babylon A. D.\\" follows the story of Toorop, anti-heroic mercenary hired to transport a mysterious girl named Aurora into the near-future America. In the film helmed by French director Mathieu Kassovitz (\\"The Hate\\" \\"The Crimson Rivers\\" \\"Gothika\\"), the futuristic world is in total chaos - like the film itself which is about as chaotic as it gets.    For all the top-notch players including Michelle Yeoh, Gérard Depardieu, Charlotte Rampling, Lambert Wilson and my favorite Mark Strong, with the cinematography of Thierry Arbogast (\\"The Fifth Element\\"), \\"Babylon A. D.\\" is a mess. Visually the film is often interesting and I really like Vin Diesel, but each action set-piece only leaves us puzzled and confused instead of exciting us. Why should they use a train, not a plane? Why a submarine? Everything looks terribly contrived.    I know the director's complaints about the studio's interference. With all respect to Mathieu Kassovitz and everyone involved in this project, however, the film had no chance of becoming whatever he had envisioned. If we could ignore the confusing narrative gaps in the latter half of the story, the badly-edited snowmobile action sequence or the very irritating and poorly-acted character of Aurora who keeps nagging suggests something is wrong with the incoherent film from the very beginning.     \\"Babylon A. D.\\" is a mildly entertaining action. Surely the visual designs sometimes look borrowed from other better films, but they are not boring. Still I am afraid that the film's production history would be more interesting than the film itself.
B001TH16DI|5.0|To echo some others' thoughts here....great set, great value at Amazon's price.  I've never seen these films look so good on home video.  The Star Trek summit disc is a wonderful extra feature.    The best news of all: we can finally see STAR TREK VI as it was seen in theaters, at the aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  Previous video incarnations of this film were presented at around 1.85:1, including the SD DVD edition.  Unlike the other films in the series, this title was shot in Super 35, which was basically a full-frame format.  Prints could then be generated at any aspect ratio by cropping portions of the full frame.  This provided a high fidelity image, shot with spherical lenses that allowed a greater depth of focus than with anamorphic (Panavision) lenses.  In the old days, it was a great way to ensure that the film would also be compatable with home video's preferred 1.33:1 ratio.  Most filmmakers shot with the \\"scope\\" aspect ratio of 2.35:1 in mind for their final product.  STAR TREK VI was shown in theaters at 2.35:1 and was meant to be seen at that aspect ratio.  Finally, Paramount got something right!
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|I saw this film twice while watching the third season of the original series, and I still have to admit that what I said about it on my blog on trekspace was right one word WOW. I grew up watching the original series in reruns before the Next Generation started in '87 and have been a trek fan ever sice. And with this film I feel no diffrent I am looking forward to the next installment.
B001E0PUI2|5.0|This book is great...lots of great useful tips and pretty funny too :) learned a lot...can't wait to try out what i've learned..will buy more
B000005S2Y|5.0|Circa 1979--I was assigned to find music to accompany some 9th grade presentation. We were told to find music that evoked emotion. We were digging through a collection of vinyl looking for something, what, we weren't exactly sure.    We started listening to this record and it darned near knocked us over! The almost Gregorian opening and chant-like melody grabbed us immediately. I was deeply involved in music at the time and I remember thinking \\"It's wonderful. I don't like it, but it's wonderful.\\" I wanted the structure of truly classical music. But for some reason the album haunted me and stuck in my memory.    Several years later I rediscovered Heaven & Hell and gave it a more thorough listening. It has been one of my favorite recordings from that time forward. Some of the more delicate passages were plucked for use in \\"Cosmos\\" the ground breaking mini-series by Carl Sagan.    Vangelis was about 10 years into his career when he made this album and about 4 from winning an Oscar for his \\"Chariots of Fire\\" soundtrack. In my opinion, this is the keystone work in his library. As a concept piece, Heaven & Hell successfully evokes emotions in the listener. Good, bad, beautiful, ugly, happy, and sad. It's all here and is impressive in its scope.
B001UREJWM|3.0|I was looking forward to getting this CD when I heard it was due. Then I saw the cover art. Yikes! And the \\"Walmart\\" cover version shown on Amazon isn't available in Canada. Oh well. (I've made 0 for 10. Yesss! Let's go for 0 for 20!)
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|What a treat to have Leonard Cohen entertaining in my living room.  The man really never grows old.  The voice, the conversation, the  songs are made new again in this splendid DVD. Treat yourself to  an incredible evening with Leonard Cohen.
0425179877|5.0|First, I will say do NOT read this book without also reading Flight: My Life In Mission Control by Chris Kraft. The two of these books go hand in hand and what one leaves out, the other fills in. Kranz focuses more on the technical side of the missions, and all the problems they encountered. His account of the Apollo 1 fire is haunting. Kraft on the other hand gives a lot more personal/personnel details. He tells you who was good to work with and who was not and why. This book was a VERY enjoyable read and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone that has even an ounce of space interest...because after you finish it, you'll be looking for more!
B001TH16DS|5.0|I started watching Star Trek beginning with its first episode in 1966. Then it was on a black & white TV. Didn't miss an episode. Later I purchased all the episodes through Columbia House video on VHS tapes. Until you see this in HD it's hard to explain. First, if you are a diehard and don't want to see any enhancements to the color, etc. you can see the episodes untouched. But for the rest of us . . .hold on to your captain chairs. They went back to the original music score and instrumentation and re-recorded the theme music complete with a Soprano singer and today's sound technology. Talk about depth and separation of sound. They also went back to the master film negative and corrected all imperfections (scratches, missed laser beams, etc.) Then they enhanced the contrast, brightness and color gamma. No more faded looking colors or missed skin tones! They made the planets look like planets instead of colored masses. Added a few extra fly-bys of the Enterprise with enhanced definition and different perspectives. Even added frames of the Enterprise laying probes from working bomb-bay style doors aft(only mentioned not shown orginally). You can also watch the episodes in enhanced and with a press of a button have it go split screen, showing unenhanced on the left and enhanced on the right. They made some additional enhanced graphics / definition in many scenes. I particularly liked the way they redid the ship leaving earth of the past. As they approached the sun it now increases in size as they draw near. It looks like a fireball with solar flares, and the ship \\"banks\\" around (instead of staying horizontal)just before whiplashing away. There is an additional hour long feature that discusses all the changes.
B000002L99|5.0|One of their best!  Always have loved this CD since it first came out, a great addition to your collection!!
B001TH16DI|5.0|I have watched all 6 star trek movies and they all look great. The set is worth the purchase especially at $79. Everything was of best quality it can be especially for the time period.
B000HGA5PM|4.0|The video and audio are not perfect but enough quality to appreciate the show. The live audio is charming compared to the highly maked up mixes.  I´m happy to found it!
0756405890|3.0|Coming off a 5 week binge of George RR Martin (all 4 books without pause), I was suddenly excited that there was fantasy worth reading again.  I asked around what I should read next - I even went so far as to ask jokingly that the recommender put their credibility at stake.  Name of the Wind was the unanimous recommendation, and that, combined with the glowing jacket reviews and numerous comparisons to Martin, clinched the decision for me.    The bottom line is that I did not enjoy Name of the Wind and find very few if any connections with Martin.  Martin is epic; Rothfuss is biopic.  Much of the praise for the book centers on Rothfuss' worldbuilding, but I don't see it - the whole book hinges on buying in to a single character, whose story is so similar to Harry Potter that its incredibly distracting (and I didn't like Harry Potter, so it was doubly annoying).  Whereas Martin's many characters are flawed, finite, and nearly always tragic, Rothfuss's Kvothe is yet another preternaturally gifted child whose obstacles are neither convincing or compelling.
0879309210|4.0|The book provides amazing detail on all aspects of maintaining and repairs guitars. If you have at least intermediate guitar experience its a great book for guitar upkeep. However for casual users and anyone who is hoping to get into this type of repair look elsewhere. It gives little explanation for those with a lack of basic knowledge and you'll spend more time looking up diagrams and terminology then reading the book.         The write is slightly biased towards certain guitars, which while popular and common, are not owned by everyone. Chapters that should be basic universal guitar help are used to spout particular brands and their specific upkeep which doesn't help those on off brand guitars. If you own a Fender or Gibson you'll be set but most other brands are left in the wayside        To summarize good for more experienced users, bad for those starting out. Good for anyone owning a guitar who wants upkeep help. Better for anyone owning a Fender or Gibson. Despite the negative comments if you have the basics down this book provides excellent tools for items as basic as cleaning your finish to repairing rotting tuners. A great book for a serious guitarist to own.
B00006ADFL|5.0|This story is a bit disturbing. It cronicles the friendship between two girls who have noone else but each other. It was a really well done story, based on the true events of these same girls. I guess the most disturbing part is the fact that they truely thought that taking the life of the one girls mother would actually keep them together.
B00006I53S|4.0|This is a great lens. The USM is so silent, I had to refocus on a few different things just to make sure it was actually working. You can't hear a thing! The image stabilization is a great feature, especially since I never carry around a tripod. It really helped out when I was shooting pictures at an air show recently. My only issue so far is that I have found if I leave my Rebel XT on auto mode, the pictures turn out too bright and kind over exposed. So I have just had to learn to set the camera up myself manually and the pictures are amazing.
0783225482|5.0|I've loved this movie for as long as I can remember. Its a very uniques story about what can happen when you can live forever. Goldie Hawn and Meryl Streep are just amazing. Its laugh out loud funny
B000ZLFALI|5.0|WONDERFUL PERIOD PIECE TAKING US THROUGH THE MOST IMPORTANT SOCIAL STRUGGLES OF A GENERATION, FROM VIET NAM, WOMEN'S RIGHTS, BLACK RIGHTS, AND THE YOUNGER GENERATION USING MUSIC TO EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS, AND PEACEFUL AS WELL AS VIOLENT RIOTS GOING ON THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  ALL SET TO BEATLES MUSIC.......VERY APPROPRIATELY.
143915726X|5.0|While helping my best friend move into her new apt. she ran across her tote of books. In the tote was the book, \\"My Sister's Keeper\\". I had never heard of the book let alone the movie. My friend told me I HAD to read it. I knew nothing about it, but trusting her judgment I read it. I found myself unable to put it down and in tears by the end. I was so sad and yet so happy for those two little girls. Since I have read it 2 weeks ago I have already told EVERYONE I know that they now HAVE to read this book.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|You have internet capabilities on your blu ray player. I have a Sony BDP-S300 player and the same thing happened to me that happened to another reviewer. A screen came up from \\"Skynet\\" saying that you need a 2.0 player and the blu ray player I have is only a 1.0. The menu finally came up and I selected the Special extended directors Cut(more on that later)and it started to play until it got to the studio canal screen and at 23 seconds it did not move. So it is the blu ray player and not the disc. I repeat: NOT THE DISC BUT THE BLU RAY PLAYER. Proof of that is then I took the disc and put it in my PS3 and it work perfectly due to the fact that it is hooked up to the internet.    Once I put it in the PS3, the Blu ray got friggin awesome. Skynet tells you that you are connected and it gives you the city you live in with area code, your email address, the degrees outside where you live and other goodies that only skynet would know. Then once you are pass that it ask you to select a version.    For everyone wondering there is all three versions of the movie on here just like the Ultimate edition. You type in the same code to get the special director's extended edition as on the Ultimate edition which is 82997. There is interactive menus as well as triva games and quizes you can do while you watch the movie as well as picture in picture. I havent watch everything yet so I cant tell you all the special features but there is a bunch more. The picture and sound is fantastic and I am glad that I waited for this version of the blu ray as it is basically the Ultimate edition dvd on blu ray. I would recommend this to anyone just know that there is a good chance that your blu ray player has to be hooked up to the internet or perhaps have all the latest updates.
1436196329|1.0|My children love all books in the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series. When they noticed the audio book in the library, they got so excited, that we had to rent it out. We listened to it in the car, but the narrator was so monotone and boring, that we returned it without going through even the 1st Cd. I am glad that I didn't buy it!!!  If you like audio books, I highly recommend the \\"A-Z Mysteries\\" and the \\"Halfmoon Investigations\\" . Both are great, with excellent narrators.
B0000CG3K6|4.0|Origin of Symmetry  is the first Muse album I've heard and it made me fall in love them.  I love the mix of operatic drama with a pounding rock, very bassy back-beat.  The vocalist makes his voice sweep back and forth like a violin, and then growls it out to sound like a snotty-nosed punk kid in the next phrase.  All of the songs meld together very well to make this effort seem like a complete stream of thought from start to finish.  Very well done.
B00000DQSV|5.0|I love Duran Duran and this record in one of their best. Could never find it in a store and found it on Amazon. Probably will listen to it til it dies. Will recommend this album to all the fans still out there.
055380684X|3.0|Author Daniel Coyle unlocks the code of talent, drawing from examples and case study in music, sports and education.  He explains the neurochemistry of getting good at an activity and punctures the myth that people are natural born geniuses in certain realms.    The Talent Code begs for obvious comparisons with another excellent book out around the same time on a similar subject, \\"Talent Is Not Enough.\\"  Both place an emphasis on not only practice, but on what Coyle calls \\"deep practice\\" - mindful concentrated rehearsal.      Read and use this book to improve at whatever skill set you are looking to refine!
B001WCN23W|5.0|First of all, if you are re-buying again, I'm assuming you know how good this is so I won't comment on that. I will comment on the remaster though. I have the old CBS Sticky Fingers and not the Virgin 94 Remaster. I set up my Sony and Oppo players to do both discs at the same time. Then, so you know, I then switched the discs to the opposing player. This UM remaster is louder at a volume reference point. I did not adjust the volume for the discs. Louder for some is better. I didn't  mind the loudness and it didn't seem to distort much at higher volumes. I mean, how loud do you need to turn your music up? It seemed there was a little more clarity on the top end and all around in the music. Sometimes that happens when you boost the sound though. I obviously bought this because I believe my old Sticky Fingers didn't have the clarity and treble I like in my music. I will say I do not like flat sounding discs and I use tone controls when listening to my music. I guess I can't be an audiophile can I? In the end it is a matter of preference in your listening habits as to if you want to make this leap. I am not totally disappointed in this remaster and I do think I could've survived without it. I hope this helps........
B0023RSZLY|1.0|The author failed to provide even basic support for much of his opinion.  I rate this as one star because:    a. I know he could have done better, having read his prior works  b. There are already too many political hacks masquerading as historical authors  c. My relatives who were present at some of the events covered in the book tell me the author was just flat wrong    YMMV; but this book was a waste of ink, paper, and energy, contributing needlessly to Global Warming.
0375826726|1.0|I first was initiated to paolini's work while working with adolescents. When I saw the first book, I thought to myself this kid has a future ahead of him. I thought the first book was intelligently written and I was really surprised to hear of the age of the writer. Second book was also Ok although not as good as the first. This third installment I am sorry to say I did not care for at all. I have to agree with some of the critics earlier that the book dragged way too much (into uninteresting subjects and the \\"meat\\" lacked) to be interesting. It also appeared to me like the writing had regressed in quality. I found Eragon very Childish in this book with his constant \\"But why?\\" and the \\"Why me\\". To me this was supposed to be a trilogy and three books is all I will procure. Others can enjoy the last book when it comes out!
B0011HOEY4|4.0|At first, because it was rated R, I wasn't going to see it, but because it was based on a true story, I thought I'd try it. The opening scene almost made me shut it off, but I hung in there since I enjoy Denzel Washington and Russell Crow (very convincing performances). I was not dissappointed. What struck me was the contrast in the two main characters - Frank Lucas (Denzel), the suave drug dealer/businssman and Det. Richie Roberts (Russell), the humble, extremely honest cop. I grew up in NY during this time and vaguely remember hearing about that. It's a good drama, the era of the late 60s - early 70s was recreated perfectly.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|Enterprise was an excellent addition to the Star Trek franchise, but like the original series, was cancelled much too soon. While there certainly seemed to be an abundance of \\"bashers\\" when the series was originally broadcast, the general mood within Trek fandom seems to have shifted a bit, allowing Enterprise to finally receive a portion of the respect that it originally deserved.    Low ratings were not caused by a poor series....    Enterprise was created at a time when the TV viewing public had just been exposed to fourteen, uninterrupted years of Star Trek (21 seasons in all), not to mention several movies. In my opinion, the mainstream public was simply burned out on \\"Trek\\". Also, the very idea of telling stories that took place PRIOR to the original series, seemed to alarm die hard fans, causing a fair amount of friction. To make things worse, UPN (The now defunct United Paramount Network) was not a healthy home for Enterprise. The network was not available in all areas across the US, and local affiliates would sometimes air episodes off-pattern (on different nights and at different times), if they even showed them at all.    A poor third season was caused by Low ratings....    Low ratings caused the writers to act out in desperation and initiate the ill conceived third season. While the Xindi plot-line itself is fairly interesting, the pacing of the season, and the \\"Xindi\\" as characters, left much to be desired. The Xindi plot was basically seen as \\"Borg-Lite\\" by many fans (a threatened Earth rehash).    Season four; What might have been....    Once the Xindi plot was wrapped up, Enterprise was back on course! Unfortunately, the news of cancellation put the writers in an awkward position. They were allowed to finish the season, but with such a limited amount of time left, they had to condense plot elements (that deserved three of four episode arcs) into single episodes. As a result, the last few episodes seemed rushed and unfinished. In particular, the resolution of the \\"Trip & T'pol\\" plot-line (in the final episode) left many fans feeling betrayed by the writers. Actress Jolene Blalock, who starred as T'pol, described the final episode as \\"appalling\\", and with good reason. \\"These are the Voyages...\\" (the final episode) is truly THE most insulting episode of Star Trek ever produced.    If you've never seen it, I would ask that you NOT believe the negative reviews. Watch it for yourself and make up your own mind. I'm almost certain that after you watch the final episode, you'll wish that Enterprise had received the traditional seven year run. Of course, you'll also wish that you never watched the absolutely wretched final episode.    Worth owning on DVD!

0783226888|2.0|The only good things about this movie are Bruce Willis, Sydney Poitier, and Jack Black. And that's about it; the rest of the movie is anything but special. It's an almost worthless movie if it weren't for the three actors mentioned above. The plot had some interesting elements, but what ruins the film are pretty much everything else. Richard Gere, especially, turns out to be quite annoying and incredibly dull. The chemistry between him and Diane Verona's character didn't work at all. I almost felt like I skipping their scenes and focusing only on Willis.<br /><br />The good editing, music, and cinematography turn out to be a waste in The Jackal. I should have watched the original 1973 film instead.

Stories built around time travel are always absurd and tend to open a huge can of worms your best left ignoring. And besides the makers of the film already did and you'll wind up hating the movie. Go in not expecting much and your experience of the film will (probably) be salvaged. If you like terminators and watching humans fight them you'll at least like those scenes.

0061711292|5.0|I'm not one to accept that a novel is worthy of \\"classic\\" billing just because everyone else says so.  Each classic I read is on trial; and there is no presumption of innocence until proven guilty.<br /><br />Muriel Spark acquitted herself convincingly.  The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie is brilliant for many reasons.  In the beginning it lulled me into the sense of comfort I get when I'm reading a Jane Austen novel.  I assumed that I would have been reading a witty coming of age tale about six Scottish girls; some witty, some not so witty and their eccentric teacher.  Spark kept up the ruse long enough so that when I realized that I'd been had, I was in way too deep to bail out.<br /><br />There isn't much action in this novel.  It concerns itself primarily with character studies.  And Spark's characterisations are uniformly brilliant.  All the major players are drawn masterfully.  Even relatively minor characters such as the artist Lloyd and his wife Diedre are fascinating.  But Spark's genius lies in the portrayal of Miss Brodie herself and the \\"Brodie girl\\" Sandy.<br /><br />This is a dark, dark novel, deceptively wrapped in the cheerful packaging of birthday and Christmas gift paper.  As the story unfolded I found that Miss Brodie was not the harmless beatnik before her time which I was led to imagine she was.  She is also not a classic anti-heroine.  Sandy is even darker.  She is more Brodie than Brodie; unhampered in her choices by considerations of conscience or sentimentality.<br /><br />Brilliant too is Spark's use of timing.  The story runs seamlessly despite the frequent and unannounced shifts in time.  The story never suffers for not being told in chronologically linear sequence.<br /><br />If the test of a novel's effectiveness is the emotional impact it has on its reader, this is a successful novel.  The dark, dark themes continued to resonate long after I put the book down.  They've lodge themselves somewhere in the back of my mind where I hide unpleasant childhood memories and resounding adult disappointments for my own protection.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|Like all works of art that endeavor to \\"illuminate\\" the Holocaust, \\"The Reader\\" ultimately finds itself looking for answers where none can be found.  Yet, the beauty of the film is that it seems to acknowledge the impossibility of its task.  Thus, rather than trying to resolve all the issues it raises, the movie simply lays them out before us, trusting that, in the final analysis, we will be able to come to our own conclusions about what, if anything, it all \\"means.\\"<br /><br />Though it is set in a number of different time periods, the story proper begins in 1958, when a 15-year-old German boy by the name of Michael Berg is seduced by a 38-year-old  woman named Hanna Schmitz.  For a summer, the two carry on a secret, illicit affair, wherein the woman introduces the boy to the joys of physical love, while he reciprocates by reading the classics to her between bouts of passionate lovemaking.  Flash forward to 1966 when Michael, now a university law student, discovers, much to his horror, that this very same Hanna who meant so much to him in his youth is actually a former concentration camp guard currently standing trial for war crimes.  The story goes even further ahead in time as a now middle-aged Michael keeps up the relationship by sending his personalized recordings of books to Hanna as she serves out her time in prison.<br /><br />There has been some criticism leveled against the film that it aims to cast a Nazi mass murderer in a \\"sympathetic\\" light.  Yet, what ultimately comes across in the story is not how \\"likable\\" a person Hanna is but how sadly tragic.  Like all fine drama, \\"The Reader\\" goes beyond the two-dimensional stereotypes of heroes and villains to examine the complexity of human relationships and the messiness of the human condition.  The movie keeps us emotionally off-balance throughout.  Even in the early stages of the courtship, we are torn between our attraction to the characters as individuals and our revulsion at the difference in their ages.  Hanna is particularly enigmatic as she embraces a child two decades her junior yet seems to find some strange fulfillment in him that goes beyond the obvious physicality of their relationship.  Despite the touchy nature of these scenes, we get a feel for what brings these two very different characters together at this particular moment in time.<br /><br />As the story moves on, the screenplay confronts many of the thornier issues surrounding what exactly happened in Germany in the middle of the Twentieth Century, questioning how so many \\"average\\" people could, at best, have turned a blind eye to the events that were occuring, and, at worst, have allowed themselves to become complicit in the mass atrocities.  There's a beautifully incisive scene in which a young law student confronts his professor, demanding to know how the man has been able to live with himself for all these years, knowing that he did not do everything within his power to try and stop what was happening. In that brief, shining moment, we get a sense of what it must have been like for the people in Germany in the decades following the war when so many, Hanna included, simply turned their backs on the past in an effort to move on with their lives.<br /><br />Perhaps the most complex character in the story is Michael, who, as he ages and learns more and more hidden truths about his first love, must come to terms with the fact that the woman he thought he knew on the most intimate of terms may, in fact, be an unrepentant mass murderer.  Yet, love is not something that can be turned on and off at will, and it takes Michael decades to figure out just how best to deal with the moral dilemma raging in the very depths of his soul.<br /><br />Michael is played first by David Kross in the period from 1958 to 1966, and then by Ralph Fiennes in the time thereafter.  Both are superb, with Kross, in particular, delivering a performance of such delicacy and sensitivity that he sets the groundwork for what Fiennesis called on to do later in the film.  And, of course, Kate Winslet, in the role that won her an Oscar, demonstrates yet again why she is one of the screen's great actresses.<br /><br />Kudos must also go to screenwriter David Hare, who has adapted Bernhard Schlink's complexly structured novel with integrity and taste, and to director Stephen Daldry and cinematographers Chris Menges and Roger Deakins for the sumptuous look they have achieved with the film.  Together, these fine artists have created a work that challenges the intellect and roils the emotions.the film.

B000002GBB|5.0|It's funny.  Dennis DeYoung once said he was not so happy with the contributions he made to this album, because he did not pen the hits 'Blue Collar Man\\" or 'Renegade\\"    He always has been their primary hitmaker.  But, the funny thing is, it's HIS songs on this record that FAR outshine either of Tommy's hits, or any of the other songs here.    This is my second favorite Styx Album, tied with Grand Illusion, and only slightly behind Equinox.    Probably a harder rock album than GI, with a really fantastic progressive edge to it.  The keyboards on this album just kill!    Band Lineup:  Dennis DeYoung-keyboards, synthesizers, lead vocals (and the most talented member of the band)  Tommy Shaw-Acoustic and Electric Guitars, vocals, sometimes lead vocals   James JY Young-Guitars, vocals, occasional lead vocals  Chuck Panozzo-Bass, vocals  John Panozzo-Drums, percussion, vocals      Breakdown:  Great White Hope--written by JY, it's actually one of his better songs.  His voice is about as tolerable as it could ever be.....and the keyboards in this song are outstanding.  7/10    I'm Ok--I like the message this song sends.  Wonderful singing by Dennis, and great organ work.  Written by both Dennis and JY, which just goes to show that collaboration between two people whose musical leanings are very divergent can produce OUTSTANDING musicianship.  10/10    Sing for the Day--written by Tommy for his daughter, which gives it some of the sentimentality akin to songs like Babe or Lady that were written by Dennis.  This is my least favorite song on the record, and not a rocker by any means.  Intriguing arrangements, however. 2/10    The Message--instrumental.  Killer synths.  Composed and performed by Dennis 6/10    Lords of the Ring--Written by Dennis but sung by JY.  JY does it justice too, amazingly enough.  Nice Synths in this one too.  7/10    Blue Collar Man--Ok....I'm gonna tell you right now....I am SICK of this song.  It's been overplayed.  Nice rocking track with some really good harmonies and keyboards (thank you Dennis), but it's one of the weaker songs on here....along with Sing for the Day and Renegade.  3/10    Queen of Spades--HOLY CRAP, what an OUTSTANDING song this is.  Written by JY and Dennis (those two need to collaborate more because the result is ALWAYS incredible)...but sung by Dennis.  Probably the hardest rocking song Dennis sings for Styx....and DAMN he can sing along with ANY hard rock vocalist.   This is Dennis is in his hardest rock guise....and all it does is leave you wanting MORE!!!   Fantastic melodies....guitar work....keyboards.....and VOCALS complete with screetching.  Wow.  25/10    Renegade--Their other \\"hit\\" from this record.  Written and sung by Tommy.  It's a good rocking song, but I'm totally sick of this one too.  Overplayed!  Good harmonies, however.  3/10    Pieces of Eight--I LOVE LOVE LOVE this song.  The melody, the keyboards, and Dennis's singing just KILLS.  Written and sung by Dennis....it's one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard in my life.  I'd describe it as a very melodic, yet rocking song.  Anthemic.  Outstanding musicianship here.  Of course, we cannot forget those trademark Styx Harmonies either....25/10    Aku-Aku--Instrumental, written by Tommy.  4/10    Anyone who wishes to understand what Styx is all about would be best served making this album as one of their initial selections.  It's outstanding.....and in NO WAY can Cyclorama be compared to this beautiful album.  Cyclorama was done without Dennis....and No Dennis=No Styx.  Ever.    THIS is Styx at their best.   My highest recommendations go to this album!
B001PPLJJ0|5.0|The film:<br /><br />\\"The Reader\\" deserved its Oscar for best actress, but it also deserved the Oscar for best film (it lost to the inferior \\"Slumdog Millionaire.\\") It tells the tale of a young man growing up in post-war Germany who has an affair with a mysterious older woman. Without spoiling too much, the story ends up touching on the holocaust, how much we can blame participants, and whether or not love transcends these historical pains.<br /><br />Normally, I dislike holocaust films. I find that Hollywood too often beats us over the head with the \\"it's BAD\\" message (This Just In! Hollywood Geniuses Discover Holocaust Was Bad!) as opposed to mining the much more interesting tales of personal struggle, loss, redemption, and ignorance. \\"The Reader\\" offers an intelligent, probing, and insightful look at the human costs on those who were not direct victims, and on the society of post-war Germany at large. It also tells a heck of a love story, to boot.<br /><br />I felt so respected by the makers of this film. There is no heavy-handed moralizing, in fact, the message of the film seems to be that, while of course there are great moral wrongs that have been perpetrated, there are lesser consequences which do not make it into history books, but do have an impact on real people and deal them real pains that ought to be respected.<br /><br />As mentioned in other reviews, this is not a movie for the kids, at least not kids who still titter when they see nudity on screen. The first half of the film is consumed by a lusty affair between a 32 year old and a 15 year old. It's not for immature audiences.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray:<br /><br />On the opening scene, I thought this film must be shot on digital. The source was just too clean, with little to no film grain in evidence. Upon further research, however, I have discovered that it was indeed shot on Kodak Vision2 and Vision3 film - which Kodak advertises as producing less grain in low light and in general. Given this, and the fact that detail is generally so strong in this image, I can only assume that this Blu-Ray has been mastered without excessive Digital Noise Reduction.<br /><br />It is a lovely 1.85:1 image which suits nice widescreen displays beautifully. Black levels are strong, loads of detail is evident in shadows, and colors are extremely naturalistic. There are many moments that offer the sort of \\"3-D\\" realism that the best HD can give. The quality of the image adds immediacy and impact to the already involving film.<br /><br />Audio is very dialogue driven. This is not a BD that will rock your neighbors.<br /><br />Extras are very strong. 42 minutes (!) of deleted scenes are presented in 480p widescreen. I watched them all, and I would say only one cut was truly unfortunate - a little bit of backstory for Michael's law professor that would have added depth to the story. Mini-documentaries are also available, touching on the writing and casting process, as well as Kate Winslet's aging with make-up. Overall, it's a very strong slate of extras.<br /><br />*********<br /><br />Any fan of serious dramas and romances would do quite well to pick this up. It's a truly great movie that is very affecting and also thought provoking. It's a monument to respecting the viewer, allowing them to digest complex morality without beating them over the head with a \\"message.\\" I would compare it to films like \\"The English Patient\\" or \\"I've Loved You So Long\\" (another 2008 Oscar Nominee).<br /><br />It is also presented in an exceedingly beautiful HD transfer and a strong package of extras.

B000RO9PXC|5.0|This show is just unbelieveable! When you're listening to it you are listening the \\"real thing\\" with The Doors. This is not \\"remastered\\" as the traditional music industry has gotten us used to. This is not \\"edited\\" as the traditional music industry has made albums to be sold. NO WAY!! This show is here on these CDs as they happened back then.... when The Doors didn't get the right tunes to carry a song along, when they had NO IDEA what song to perform in a live show and when Jim Morrisson (of course!) was so lost on stage into the effects of alcohol and drugs as well. This whole thing is the beauty if this set... checkin a band being who they always were. I do applaud whoever was responsible of this project for keeping it as it was.
1592402690|5.0|...Ever since I picked up my first Beatles biography-slash-memoir, I always felt that there was a side to their story that was missing. And Emerick's accounts filled that void.<br /><br />The fact that this book takes the point of view of someone who was with the band at their most essential--their music--is enough to merit this a place on any fan's shelf.<br /><br />More important for me, though, was the fact that Emerick provided yet another insight (and often, a totally different and unexpected one, at that) on the 4 guys that were the Beatles. Just when I thought that I might finally have an inkling as to who John, Paul, George, and Ringo really are (or were), Emerick reveals (whether accurately or not, who knows) the ineptitude of Lennon on the basics of sound recording, Harrison's near-embarrassing incompetence on guitars during the earlier band albums, and Ringo's apparent mulishness in his more private moments. On McCartney, Emerick is blatantly biased for...he loves the guy.<br /><br />Of course, I suppose I needn't be surprised. Different people impact on different Beatles members, and different circumstances (say, touring across the globe vs being ensconced in the EMI Studios) would inevitably impel a different side of a Beatle to show. There's something to be said for seeing how the band works when it's time to do their voodoo--and Emerick's stories of the often zany and challenging, or utterly aggravating and tension-filled (but definitely never boring) Beatles studio sessions are every fan's wet dream.<br /><br />The great music that churned out from EMI studios like that of Revolver, Sgt. Pepper, and their swan song Abbey Road, among others, would then be seen as a combination of artistry (both from the side of the band and of the engineer & producer), providence, as well as unmitigated accident...with a smattering of intended flukes that were nothing more than secret jokes played for their listeners.<br /><br />Whatever may be the case, Emerick's stories are to be treasured--it tells of how, as a sound engineer, he was pushed to his creative limits as a response to the unceasing fervor of the band to raise the bar for themselves, expecting nothing less from the people who handle their music.<br /><br />Half the time, of course, I don't even understand the technicalities that Emerick spouts about...but it doesn't matter. What really mattered to me is finally having someone show me how the band members forged musical history as they crowded about a mic, or tinkered about in a piano, guitar, or synthesizer, or how they showed their vulnerabilities by eventually inevitably drifting apart from one another, to the point that they literally could not stand each other's presence for long periods of time.<br /><br />This insider look at the Beatles recording at the height of their career is a must-read. Certainly, as the the New York Times Book Review states, this book will irresistibly pull readers back to listening to these well-loved songs...straining their ears to hear those tell-tale sounds, clicks, and echoes that told hidden stories and marked a revolution in music.w, as a sound engineer, he was pushed to his creative limits as a response to the unceasing fervor of the band to raise the bar for themselves, expecting nothing less from the people who handle their music.

0312944098|3.0|By his own admission, Jeffrey Archer's A Prisoner of Birth is a modern day tale of revenge and self-reinvention that borrowed from and relied heavily on Dumas's The Count of Monte Cristo.  For this reader it appears that Archer was inspired by more than one author.  Prisoner also smacks of other Dumas works as well as G. B. Shaw's Pygmalion (My Fair Lady) and a previous Archer tome titled \\"Not a penny more, Not a penny less\\".<br /><br />SUMMARY:  A man from the wrong side of the tracks (Danny Cartwright) is convicted and imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit based on the false testimony of four supposedly upright individuals (Musketeers) from the right side of the tracks. While in prison he is schooled in etiquette and the kings English by a fellow cellmate (Sir Nicholas Montcrieff).  Danny is not only a willing and amazingly astute Eliza to the Nicholas's Henry Higgins, he also possesses the street smarts that Nicholas lacks.<br /><br />Through an unbelievable set circumstances (which I will not discuss lest it spoil the pleasure of other Prisoner readers) Danny is able to plot his revenge against his accusers and dispense his own particular brand of justice.<br /><br />Even though you've undoubtedly come across many variations of this plot before, you will find that Archer's skill with the written word will make the 500+ pages of Prisoner fly by. 3 1/2 STARS
B001PA0FFO|5.0|Let me say it up front: Change is inevitable. The four seasons show us that. But what change? To what end? What does doubt do to the equation? Can good come from doubt?<br /><br />\\"Doubt\\" depicts the troubling nature of doubt. In fact, the viewer is lead by the playwright's skillful dialog to question Sister Aloysious as a righteous destroyer. Are her doubts founded? In her best role to date as idealistic, but easily influenced Sister James, Amy Adams shows us the damaging nature of doubt and resulting gossip and outright allegations.<br /><br />You see, Donald Miller is the first African American student in St. Nicholas Catholic School in Boston in 1964. Father Flynn takes a special interest in Donald because he is isolated and intimidated. The doubt begins when Sister James relates an incident--rather, pieces of an incident--about Donald's being called alone to the rectory.<br /><br />Actually, the doubt begins with Sister-and-Principal Aloysious and her strict, stern, brook-no-nonsense way of running the school. One scene shows the deadly dull minimal talk at the dinner table among the nuns. The other shows the three priests in lively, hilarious conversation. Joy and community vs duty and stodginess. The contrast actually shows the viewer the extremes that can exist in a conflict and should warn as foreshadowing instead of truth.<br /><br />It's an unspoken accusation that is at the center of this drama. Is Father guilty or not? The film's tone would have us believe that Sister Aloysious is on a witch hunt because she dislikes the warm, caring, and popular priest. However, as a teacher in a Catholic school where diligence training concerning sexual abuse and harrasment is a monthly event, I understand Sister Aloysious's attention to this duty. What is more important: the care of a child or the protection of a priest? There's a very fine line here and one the playwright/director walks so carefully.<br /><br />Is the priest guilty?

B00243FQFA|5.0|I really do not watch too much TV anymore because of lack of quality and/or story telling. Certain series however are the exception and Stargate is that exception for me.  I have always had a liking for good Sci-fi, but that's rare for me also.  I think a LOT of Sci-fi is as worthless as much of the other nonsense that is on TV.    I didn't start watching any of the Stargate series because I thought that the original movie \\"STUNK\\".  But many years later I caught an episode of Stargate Atlantis and began watching the series from that point on the Sci-Fi channel.  Needless to say that I began to really enjoy the Atlantis series (Rodney Mac - really takes time to endure his annoying character!).  Seasons 4 and 5 were outstanding.  Sooooo, I watched the entire five seasons and was not disappointed!      Soooooo, I started to watch the Stargate SG-1, just to see what all of the references, terminologies, etc, were that I did not understand in Atlantis.  I began with season 1 and I am now in season 3.  I'm truly enjoying the Stargate world.  My brother, if he were alive, would really enjoy SG. He really loved sci-fi and turned me on to it many years ago.      enjoy!    h
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|THIS CD IS THE COMBINATION, IN MY HUMBLE OPINION, OF THE TWO GREATEST MUSICIANS OF OUR TIME.  STEVIE WINWOOD IS SOOOOOOOOOO TERRIBLY UNDER-RATED IN THIS COUNTRY. EVERYONE KNOWS HOW WONDERFUL CLAPTON IS (!!), BUT STEVIE IS UNMATCHED ON THE HAMMOND AND PLAYS A GRRRRRRREAT GUITAR.  HE CAN DO ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING.  MY FAVORITE CD OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000FS9MV0|2.0|DO NOT BUY THIS CD FOR SKYLARK OR LOVER MAN!! You will be disappointed as it sounds awful! I will stick with the original talents on the classics. The rest of the songs are mediocre, but the back ground music was nice.
B00197POXG|5.0|I highly recommend Dr Quinn, Medicine Woman: The Complete Series Megaset.  It is true the package the dvd disks are in could be more sturdy.  It's also true it is hard to get each disk out of it sleeve.  What I do is once I have the disk out I leave the disk in the dvd player.  And when we want to see a picture I just open the drive and close it and the picture comes on to the screen.  We are on disk six and so far the words and the actors/actresses voices are in sink with each other.  The color is beautiful and to date each picture is new to us.  Either we forgot what we saw when it first aired on television or we haven't seen these series.
B001PPLIFU|2.0|This movie is just like most other Bond movies except with 30 minutes of story, interaction, and humour edited out. Lots of fancy camera work thou is suppossed to make up for it. There is a skeletal plot based on the events of Casino Royale, but I could hardly understand much or try to care what Bond's motivations are... all you know is that he is pissed for some good reason and he doesn't care about anything except that he is pissed. Craig is given one expression to show, and he looks good showing it. And the movie ends as another Bond movie. Kinda boring and uninvolving, but it looks good I suppose.
B001N26GFM|4.0|I've seen a great number of movies in my 76 years; I've not seen the best, however, this one comes very close. I'm a self-appointed expert on the Nazi regime and this movie is a very good depiction of that time in our lives. I highly recommend the movie especially to those of you who were alive at that time - 4.48 stars.
B001FB55HG|3.0|Firstly, I'm a huge Terminator fan, and despite Cameron's abscence on all the incarnations of the mythology after the Universal Studios 3-D ride i've been an avid follower of the Terminator franchise.  I had read only one article concerning this new film in last month's Fangoria, and Mcg, the director, stated that it was going to follow the mythology set by the first two films and leave out the third, but after viewing the film I found that to be untrue.  Even Salvation's script was written by the same screenwriters of part three, Brancato and Ferris.  Before I go any further, let me see if I can get the Terminator movie timeline down:<br />Terminator happened in 1984.<br />T2 happeneed 13 years later in 1997.<br />Terminator 3 happened  ten years later in 2007.<br />Finally, this film happens  eleven years later in 2018.<br /><br />Okay, I think I got it, unless some fanboys out there can correct me.  Sorry Rise Of The Machines haters, this is a direct sequel to that film.  It uses the last film's new timeline and also brings back the newly introduced character of Kate Brewster, this time played by Bryce Dallas Howard filling in for Claire Danes.  Characters, HA!  That's one of this sequels biggest problems, the characters aren't interesting even one bit.  They're all action movie cyphers, that are barely indistinguishable.  I mentioned Bryce Dallas Howard earlier, and I still can't figure out why she would want to be in this film.  She has nothing to do, but look concerned for John and rush around.  The relationship that the third film hinted at is all but glossed over and we find our couple already ready to have a baby in the midst of war.  Guess, protection like condoms were wiped out completely in the nuclear holocaust.  Maybe they should have gone to one of the many abandoned 7-11's still standing .<br /><br />The two main characters in this film are John Connor(Christian Bale), of course, and a new character, an ex-con found in cryo sleep named Marcus(Sam Worthngton).  I was excited by Bale's casting as the older Connor.  Adding him to the cast meant, at least to me, that the new Connor would be more war worn but still have some humanity.  I'm sorry to report that any action movie star could've played the Connor in this film.  He's more robotic then, well, the robots.  Long gone are the human touches added by Edward Furlong and to a lesser degree Nick Stahl.  It's sad because one of the climax's big emotional beats is lost because of the way the character is portrayed and written.  I understand that this Connor has to be harder, but this hard makes him unrelatable and even worse, uninteresting.  Sam Worthington is far more interesting.  He is your basic anti-hero with a secret past.  There is a point when he has a relationship with a downed resistance pilot, but it's far too brief and not depthful enough to justify why she helps him out of a jam later in the film.  She is played well enough, the actress' last name is Moonblood(can't think of the first name at the moment).  She's brings a likeable and HUMAN presence to a film that desperately needs it.  Too bad there wasn't more of her.  Her relationship with Marcus in the final film relies more on the 100 year old and well known to the audiences of cinema convention of what must happen when two strangers of the opposite sex have a chance encounter.  Unfortunately, Marcus' character's two main plot twists are either ruined by the trailers or just predictable.<br /><br />Special mention must go to Anton Yelchin.  He does a spot on impression of Michael Biehn's character from the first film in his teenage form.  He must've watched and listened to Michael Biehn very closely.  Though he doesn't look anything like the original's Kyle Reese you can feel his presence.<br /><br />The lost humanity in this film I feel is due to some editing in the final film.  Since the film is 90% action and no interesting dialogue or character moments I suspect the studio asked Mcg to edit themovie down to its basic plot and get to the action scenes faster.  I suspect an unrated director's cut dvd in the future with more then graphic violence added back into the film.  Mcg does a good job with this film.  The tone is dark, much darker then the last film's.  The action scenes are good but not too over the top.  If the character beats were stronger or existed on any level the scenes would've had much more impact.  I really do believe these character beats exist, in no small way due to the fact that I know that screenwriter Paul Haggis(Casino Royale, Crash, In the Valley of Allah) was a ghost writer on this.<br /><br />The PG-13 rating doesn't effect this film.  It's brutal and dark and unrelenting in its tone and violence.  There's a couple of gun battles where you can tell some bullet hits were edited out but that's about it.  Plus, the lack of profanity makes the film feel less authentic as a war film.  But that's about it.<br /><br />The special effects are good and KEWL and blah, blah, blah, blah...Do we even need to mention them anymore when it comes to big Hollywood films?  Speical effects are so pristine these days it makes you wonder why the characters and story haven't become important again.  They should be after this summer, which is shaping up to be a major let down as far as the big genre films go.  Though, and this one is impressive and scary, the special effects that were used to give Arnold Schwarzenegger is cameo without him having to show up for filming were very impressive.  It was fun seeing Arnold the way he looked back in 1984, down to the hair cut.  Scary, seeing how with the scripts that get filmed these days, how actors bringing any life to a film may not be necessary one day.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this film and I suspect I will once the dvd comes out in its director's cut.  This movie feels like Skynet took over the edit.  Way too many machines blowing up stuff real good and not enough of the humanity that the previous films had.  If I'm wrong about the edit, and there's no director's cut, then I feel less bad about not giving this film its fourth star.  Sigh....tion scenes faster.

020161622X|4.0|This is a good handbook for programmers who care about their craft.  It serves as an good overview of many best-practices.  The book provides a strong motivational force to reflect on your own techniques, habits, and mistakes, and to then go forward and improve.<br /><br />Many of the Tips in the book might seem obvious and well known to an experienced programmer.  Indeed the subtitle is \\"from journeyman to master\\".  We humans seem to learn by repetition, so even if you already understand know every single idea in the book, it's not a bad to review, reconsider, and re-align yourself from time to time.<br /><br />In general the quality of the tips leads me to make this a 'must-read' recommendation for any programmer aspiring to greatness. The book provides a strong focus on test driven development via several related tips, so it has quite a bit of overlap with many other books on the market, some of which I have reviewed here.<br /><br />Some of my favorite tips are:<br /><br />\\"Don't Live With Broken Windows\\" -- This one really stuck with me and comes back to mind on a frequent basis.  The idea that a little bit of disorder naturally leads to more disorder (entropy) is a strong one.  The example given is the well known \\"broken windows theory\\" that describes a form of inner city degradation.<br /><br />\\"Prototype to Learn\\" -- this is something that has really become important to me over the last few years.  You absolutely must create experiments when solving unknown problems.  And once the learning has been accomplished, you must be prepared to throw the code away, but keep the knowledge gained.  One of the mistakes junior programmers tend to make is to believe that every line of code is precious and should be preserved.<br /><br />\\"Design to Test\\" -- this is of course some of the TDD overlap I mentioned earlier.  However in my experience this side effect of TDD is one of the most powerful aspects of the technique.  When you are planning or writing your tests from the very beginning, you are _forced_ to consider how your modules will be properly unit tested.  And this consideration _forces_ your modules to be, well, modular.  Testable.  Cleaner.ow your modules will be properly unit tested.  And this consideration _forces_ your modules to be, well, modular.  Testable.  Cleaner.

B000002GB6|3.0|Everyone who wasn't deaf in the 70s knew Feels So Good.  The album version is longer with more improv than the radio version.  I was a big Mangione fan then. I liked 70s easy jazz in general, and his band had a very smooth 70s sound (except when Chuck himself played out of tune). However, none of these tunes in particular excite me.  Summary:  Band: great.  Tunes: eh.

B000P0J0B0|5.0|This movie is crazy ridiculous.  The violence is over the top. All acting performances are amazing and Robert Downey jr.'s performance stands out the cast similar to Tom Sizemore's small role that is played well. Rodney Dangerfield takes a bizarre turn as an abusive father. Oliver Stone did a good job, but I would have preferred QT's original draft that he originally had to sell to fund Reservoir Dogs. Oh well, at least this is still interesting.
B001FB55HG|1.0|Not learning from either the massive successes of their first two films or the junk heap which was the third, the writers/producers continued toying with a great franchise.<br /><br />And it's not just a case of 'memories from the past'. They toyed with how to kill the terminators themselves. Which if you're going to do a 'future' in today's now-future, using the then-technology which was already established to elaborate on that same storyline (as was infered) would make sense. This was actually a key feature of the films, what made them such a 'good' tool as had been conceptualized by Skynet.<br /><br />Instead, in a lame attempt to be 'current' the special effects department makes new ways to kill the machines---inadvertently toying with the franchise's whole pre-established backstory.<br /><br />Ugggh! Just leave good enough alone already.<br /><br />Christian Bale is a great actor and I've seen him rescue other franchises (remember Batman?). So this abomination should not rest at his feet in any way. He did the best he could with the material with which he was provided to work with. And for this I commend him.<br /><br />I also like Bryce Dallas Howard, playing Kate Connor, the role previously inhabited by Claire Danes. Coming across as John's partner in the film, they are going to save humanity togeter. I could not help but think of today's bleak economic scenario while watching the two of them work together for a 'better tommorrow'. This part of the film was salvageable.<br /><br />The writers and the producers are the ones who need to be held responsible for having allowed this project to have seen the light of day.
B00005UEAR|5.0|One of Dream Theater's best albums, rivaling Scenes from a Memory in my opinion. There's something for nearly everyone in hear, ranging from fans of Dream Theater's heavy metal side to fans of their progressive side  and fans of their softer emotional work. Must buy, for 1st time DT listeners to hardcore fans (like myself =D)
0006547745|5.0|This is an account of William Dalrymple's tour in 1994 of the Middle East, from Mount Athos, through Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, the West Bank, Israel and Egypt.  His object was to follow in the footsteps of John Moschos, a 7th century monk who had recorded such a journey, and Dalrymple's quest was to search out what is left of Christianity today in a region that had for many centuries been the centre and heartland of Eastern Christendom.<br /><br />It is a beautifully written mixture of vivid touristic descriptions and encounters on the one hand and, on the other, a historical account of Christianity under the Byzantine and Ottoman Empires and under modern Turkish, Syrian, Israeli and Egyptian rule. He visits places that were once great centres of civilization - Antioch (now Antakya), Edessa (now Urfa)  - but are now at best provincial centres and at worst crumbling ruins.  They were once rich in ethnic and religious diversity; and Dalrymple gives a sympathetic account, often laced with gentle humour, of even the weirdest of the beliefs, superstitions and practices of early Christianity and indeed of some contemporary monks.<br /><br />The 20th century in particular has seen a huge cultural impoverishment under the fanaticism of modern nationalism.  As recently as 1955 there was a pogrom against Greek Christians in Istanbul which Dalrymple describes as `the worst race riot in Europe since the Kristallnacht' with seventy three orthodox churches gutted.  How widely is that known or remembered today?  At the end of the Graeco-Turkish war in the early 1920s there were still 400,000 Greeks in the city; by the time of the 1955 riot they had been reduced to 75,000 and today there are perhaps  5,000 left, and even they are imperilled by the rise of Islamic fundamentalism since the 1990s.  The fate of the Armenian Christians is better known, as is the touchiness on this subject of the Turks, who  are even now obliterating churches and monuments which bear witness to  the fact that once there was a flourishing Armenian civilization in Eastern Turkey.  At the end of the 19th century there were 200,000 members of the Syriac Orthodox Church - in the 1990s only about 900  were left.  Christian villages were then being burnt to the ground on the pretext that their inhabitants collaborated with the Kurdish PKK (who in turn accuse the Christians of collaborating with the Turks).<br /><br />In Eastern Turkey Dalrymple was always shadowed by the police, and his visits to the remaining monasteries greatly disturbed the monks there.  The atmosphere was completely different when he crossed into Syria.  Although that country was also crawling with secret police, there was no discrimination there against Christians, and thousands of them had fled there: Armenians from Turkey, Nestorians from Iraq, Christian refugees from Palestine.  Hafiz Asad, the then dictator of Syria, came from a minority Muslim sect, the Alawites, and his power base was made up of a coalition of minority creeds in a largely Sunni population.  The Christians felt secure for the moment, but dreaded what might happen on Asad's death.  (He would of course be succeeded in 2000 by his son Bashar.)  And meanwhile Dalrymple can witness Muslims worshipping together with Christians at the shrine of the Virgin of Saidnaya.<br /><br />On to the Lebanon - just four years after the end of the 16 year-long civil war whose ruins were still all around.  The Maronite Christians, whose French-created dominance was one of the causes of the war, had lost out, and some 300,000, over a quarter of the Christian community, had fled. But Maronite clans had been as likely to murder each other as they were to murder Druzes or Muslims.  And when they turned on Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, Christian Palestinians suffered along with the rest.<br /><br />Next Dalrymple stays at Mar Saba, an austere monastery in the Judaean Hills, whose orthodox monks believe in demons and are convinced that the Pope is a Freemason and that on the Day of Judgment all non-Orthodox, Roman Catholics included, will suffer the torments of Hellfire in the valley below the monastery.<br /><br />Crossing into Israel proper, Dalrymple records another shrinking Christian population, though the figures he gives on page 317 don't remotely add up. Moreover, he says elsewhere (p.363) that the number of Christian Palestinians in Israel proper has actually quadrupled since 1949.  But in the Old City of Jerusalem the Christian population has shrunk from 52% in 1922 to 2.5%.  The Israelis make life as difficult for the Christian Arabs as they do for the Muslims; and many Muslims are also hostile to them (though Dalrymple does not mention that), so the Christian emigration rate is double that of the Muslims.  This chapter is full of the iniquities of the Occupation.<br /><br />Then finally to Egypt, beginning with a wonderful evocation of Alexandria past and present - the past vibrant with many cultures;  the present, since Nasser expropriated or drove out the Greeks, the Jews, the French and the English, a largely monocultural shell. From there Dalrymple went south, via the fount of the monastic movement at St Antony, to Asyut province, the main centre of the Coptic Christians, and an area where Islamicist fanatics carry out murderous attacks on Copts, tourists and the State. The State fights the Islamicists, but thinks that the best way of combatting fanaticism is to allow the country to be Islamicized.  Dalrymple needs a massive escort of troops and police to visit the monasteries there.  It makes for a graphic end to an account of how everywhere in the Middle East - Syria excepted - the ever-diminishing number of Christians are under enormous pressure.<br /><br />The one fault of this very readable book is the frequent absence of dates: ranging, as he does, over many centuries, Dalrymple simply assumes that his readers know (or are prepared to look up) in which of them the  Emperor Justinian ruled, when the two Simon Stylites sat on their pillars, when the Lebanese Civil War began and ended etc.  The book badly needs a chronological appendix.of Judgment all non-Orthodox, Roman Catholics included, will suffer the torments of Hellfire in the valley below the monastery.

0385340575|4.0|First, let me add my comment to the other reviewers who have actually read the latest \\"Reacher\\" novel instead of complaining about the price on Kindle. (The average rating for those who read the book is four or five stars.) I enjoyed \\"Gone Tomorrow\\" more than \\"Nothing to Lose,\\" based on sheer pace and suspense without quite all the apocalyptic political \\"baggage\\" that weighed down the last novel.     While Child still has some points to score about the Patriot Act, Donald Rumsfeld, and so on (I don't want to give away the plot), he also depicts some characters in our government worthy of Reacher's (and the reader's) respect. More importantly, \\"Gone Tomorrow\\" is vintage Reacher in terms of allowing the reader to solve the puzzle alongside our hero. There are some terrific action sequences and, as always, everything Reacher observes and learns along the way comes in handy at the end.     All this being said...I'll save the 5-star review for the next Reacher book that takes Jack into his true element...in the middle of nowhere, one man against the world.
B001TH15UM|1.0|Totally agree with a previous review about the sound mix on the Blu-ray disc - it's awful. You get 3 options, DTS-HD, Dolby 5.1, and LPCM. Both the DTS-HD and Dolby 5.1 are terrible - you can barely hear the guitar and anytime the keyboard plays it is way louder than all the other instruments. The only way this disc is watchable is by using the LPCM audio option, which doesn't suffer from the bad audio mixing, but still isn't worth paying extra for Blu-ray. Don't know if this is a problem with my player - it's a Panasonic DMP-BD35, but if you're looking for sweet DTS-HD sound, keep looking.
015206396X|3.0|Graceling is the story of a young woman named Katsa born with the \\"grace\\" of survival. It gives her superhuman strength which is a both a blessing, because she can defend herself; and a curse because her grace is exploited by her unscrupulous uncle who is ruler of their kingdom. As soon as her grace is discovered, she is trained as a killer and is sent on errands for the king against those who would oppose him.<br /><br />Guilt ridden by the pain that she has caused, Katsa decides to form a benevolent council to right the wrongs she has done on behalf of her uncle. It is at one of these secret missions that she meets Prince Po, a young man from a neighboring kingdom who is graced with insight and foretelling. Prince Po understands Katsa and she feels she has met her match in hand-to-hand combat. Katsa is drawn to Prince Po's warmth and sense of humor and the two become fast friends. In spite of Katsa's promises never to fall in love she finds herself doing just that.<br /><br />The rest of the story takes Katsa and Po on an adventure to gather information about Po's grandfather's kidnapping and the story's twists and turns keep the action going and easily readable. There were problems with the writing, however, that made the prose seem choppy and poorly executed. Sentences were often repeated and I found myself thinking, \\"Okay you've said that already. Let's move along.\\" I was able to overlook most of that, but not the heroine's choices.<br /><br />Katsa is a young woman in her late teens and, as such, she has some set ideas about marriage and motherhood---she will do neither. It is never clear why she feels this way, but I predicted that she would change her mind by the end of the book. I was hoping that Katsa would grow from her experiences and new found love. But from the beginning of the book until the end, she held fast to her decision never to marry. I could see how deeply in love she had fallen with Po and he with her. She suffered greatly over his well-being when he was in peril and he gave her a ring which, unbeknownst to her, made Katsa owner of everything he held dear. His very identity was tied up in that ring and he gave it to her.  You don't find that kind of love every day and yet Katsa looked squarely into Po's mother's eyes and told her that she would never marry. That makes no sense to me. Instead Katsa justifies her decision as not wanting to take Po's choice to one day love another. What the heck?<br /><br />Part of falling in love with someone means including them in your plans. It can sometimes mean that that which once was important to you no longer is as enticing if the one you love is not there to share it with you. Perhaps because the author is a young woman herself and has imparted some of her own notions of marriage and family to her heroine do we see Katsa reflect those ideas. Perhaps the author needs to grow herself so that her characters will as well. Because of this I am afraid the story left me somewhat unsatisfied.<br /><br />Graceling was a highly readable story with some flaws that made it less than perfect.and he gave her a ring which, unbeknownst to her, made Katsa owner of everything he held dear.

It can sometimes mean that that which once was important to you no longer is as enticing if the one you love is not there to share it with you. Perhaps because the author is a young woman herself and has imparted some of her own notions of marriage and family to her heroine do we see Katsa reflect those ideas. Perhaps the author needs to grow herself so that her characters will as well. Because of this I am afraid the story left me somewhat unsatisfied.     Graceling was a highly readable story with some flaws that made it less than perfect.
B001RTP48G|5.0|After waiting for months and then listening to the album on Utube due to its being released in the UK a month before the US, it finally arrived.  Fantastic, true PSB, had me dancing and memorizing the words from start to finnish!  GET THIS ALBUM!  If you're a PSB fan, you'll love it.  If you're new to PSB, try it!
B001R4KQDE|5.0|You already know the movie so all I can say is that the Blu-Ray has a much richer dynamic range, so buy it.
B001P9KR94|5.0|I initially ignored this movie since I thought it was another lame musical as shown in the commercials.  Now after having rented it to see what the hype was about, I now plan on purchasing it.  It is not a musical...fire the people who marketed it.    Believe what the 4-5 star reviewers say about this; ignore the 1-2.  It had a low budget compared to the typical Hollywood movie, but I honestly could not tell.  I rented it on Blu-ray, and it looked amazing.
B001IBIQU6|5.0|LOVE the new CD!  Can't wait to see them on tour later this summer.  It came in prompt fashion and wrapped as it should be.
0375842209|5.0|This is such an amazing book, I can't tell you how much I enjoyed it. The setting was kind of foreign for me but that didn't distract from the enjoyment when I started to get into it. The story and character development were terrific, and I loved the poetic style it's written in. It was recommended to me by a friend who's in a book club and it was their monthly pick. They ALL in the group loved it and were filled with laughter and tears, so I decided I couldn't go wrong with it. I was right. This beautifully written story in a way reminded me so much of Anne Frank's diary and I suppose in some ways Liesel isn't so much different from Anne. This sad story will move you in a special way and it really is the best book I've read in awhile.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I NEVER review anything I buy but I feel compelled to write about this DVD.  I LOVE this workout.  I have been doing it for about a month and haven't felt this strong in years.  It is very good at working your core muscles.  I go back and forth between level 2 and level 3.  It's a very exciting and fun work out, I actually look forward to doing it.  Jillian kills you for 20 minutes and you feel so good when it's done.  This is hands down the best workout DVD I have EVER used.  It is changing my body.
B001SN78JO|5.0|Surprisingly, a very good movie.  Easy to relate to the character of Jim Carey, not wanting to do things, and then suddenly, finding himself saying yes to everything.  That made this movie very funny!  Turns out saying yes was the best thing he was doing.  Great movie.
0385340575|5.0|\\"Gone Tomorrow\\" hooks the reader on the first page when Reacher, the quintessential loner American hero, finds himself on a New York subway late at night with another passenger who meets all the criteria for being a suicide bomber.  What to do?  Intervene, and perhaps make it worse?  Ignore the warning signals?  What if Reacher is wrong?  Of course, Reacher gets involved.    And then things really get exciting.  Reacher finds himself in the middle of a maze of lies, told by everyone from the victim's family, to the local cops, to a Senate candidate.  And if he can't find the truth, he'll surely be killed.    \\"Gone Tomorrow\\" gives us Reacher at his very best - impeccably logical, always ready to dish out mayhem, and completely unstoppable.    It's also Lee Child at his best - tension that mounts from the first to the last page, tightly would plotting, and lean, elegant prose.    Definitely a book not to be missed.

B001RTP48G|5.0|I got on Amazon.com to look for a long-lost Pet Shop Boys CD single (\\"Was It Worth It?\\", with the \\"Miserablism\\" Electro Remix by Moby), when I saw the advertisement for \\"Yes!\\"  As a fan since 1986, I was giddy.  The Boys have only let me down once, with \\"Bilingual\\", though even that one has grown on me over time and proven to be a masterpiece(the re-release with the bonus material really helped).  I think Tennant and Lowe have been making excellent music since the get-go, and \\"Yes\\" continues to pass the torch.  At first it wasn't what I was expecting...it wasn't until \\"More Than a Dream\\" that a big goofy grin spread across my face and that familiar joy bubbled up inside me - the Boys are back in town!  \\"King of Rome\\" made me pause and look wistfully off into the distance as I felt the soulful and heartfelt vibrations of Tennant's masterful falsetto and the rich percussions wash over me...\\"The Way It Used to Be\\" is another high point, poppy and driving.  By the time the album was over, I was ready to hear it again - each listen deepens my appreciation.  I realize now why I like them so much - they are not afraid to transform their sound and explore new musical territories.  At their very core, these are two intelligent, clever, talented guys who make great electronic music with thought-provoking, at times ironic, at times poetic, lyrics.  They are good at what they do, and they enjoy it, and it shows!  I sense some double meanings in \\"Legacy\\"...I hope they are not saying goodbye in that song (\\"Look at me / I'm so over it\\").  I sincerely hope there are more albums left in this dynamic duo.  A few more things...the bonus disk is AWESOME!  First \\"Night Life\\", then \\"Relentless\\", and finally \\"Fundamental\\" have each had explosive bonus material that expands the experience of the original album - a two-for-one I wouldn't miss.  \\"Yes\\" is no exception.  \\"This Used to Be the Future\\" is the most poignant techno song I have ever heard - like a pop song from a Bladerunner-esque future.  At first I thought Neil and Chris were finally doing a duet, but now I hear its the dude from Human League (\\"Don't You Want Me, Baby?\\").  This track alone is worth the price of admission.  I think they put it on the bonus disk to prevent it from overshadowing the album tracks. Each subsequent dub remix that follows gets better and better...\\"Pandemonium - Stars and Sun Dub\\" bears an immediate re-listen after the first hearing.  The disk culminates with the \\"Love, Etc\\" mix.  This is a hard disk to remove from my player!  Just what I needed to start my summer - fresh new music from one of the most talented and seasoned musicians out there today - thank you Chris and Neil  here's to many more!
B001XRLWPQ|4.0|CASTLE is one hell of an entertaining piece of light, fluffy cop television. It's the perfect antidote to those who are wallowing in the dark sewers of cop shows like LAW AND ORDER SVU or CRIMINAL INTENT or the brilliant but extreme THE SHIELD. Creator Andrew Marlowe, perhaps best known as the screenwriter for AIR FORCE ONE, has created a very breezy and incredibly fun cop show that's primary purpose is to counter the altogether too intense police procedurals that the public seems to inhale like cigarette smoke (you know it's not good for you, but you can't help it). He's also added the perfect actor for a show like this: Nathan Fillion. Many people weren't familiar with Fillion's work until he became a cast member of the horrifically awful DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES, but before that, he was a key player in what's known as The Whedonverse, starring in the all-too shortlived FIREFLY and also guest-starring in the final season of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. He was also featured in one of Whedon's more recent and brilliant creations, DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG, where he wonderfully plays a shallow, over-confident superhero. He also appeared in another VERY shortlived Fox television show called DRIVE, which was cut down before it could reach its potential. He's been featured in films like the FIREFLY sorta-sequel SERENITY, a wonderful indie splattergore comedy called SLITHER, and some unfortunate direct-to-DVD fare like WATER'S EDGE and WHITE NOISE 2: THE LIGHT. But as he proved with FIREFLY, he has more than enough talent and charisma to carry a show on his own if necessary (even though it wasn't necessary with how great FIREFLY was).<br /><br />And that's very much the case with CASTLE. As mystery writer Richard Castle, this is his show. Despite some strong supporting performances by actors like Susan Sullivan, who plays his flamboyant, vibrant, and at times, annoying mother, and a sometimes over-her-head Stana Katic as his professional and personal foil, NYPD Detective Kate Beckett, this show and everything great about it is planted rightly and firmly on the charm and talent of Fillion.<br /><br />The show is very much in the vein of a program like MOONLIGHTING, pitting the goofy yet irrestistably charming lothario against the by-the-book, stalwart, intelligent and sassy and undeniably sexy-but-sexless woman as the two of them get into one wild adventure after another. The thing about this show that gives it perhaps an even stronger catch than a show of this type should is that it has a specific \\"mythology\\" arc that will carry it for at least another season; namely the unsolved murder of Beckett's mother, and Castle's determination to solve it, even if it means that he will lose a friend and potential love interest in Beckett.<br /><br />So I say bring on Season Two, and continue the tone that the show has given us, and don't let it conform to what the \\"hitmakers\\" see trending with the too-upsetting cop shows. Keep it easy breezy. And hopefully the show will get the audience it deserves, and Fillion will get more of the opportunities he deserves.ett, this show and everything great about it is planted rightly and firmly on the charm and talent of Fillion.

0563486430|4.0|The Stone Rose is my second Doctor Who read by Jacqueline Rayner (following Winner Takes All featuring the ninth Doctor). Rayner takes the Doctor (as played by David Tennant) and Rose (Billie Piper) to ancient Rome following Mickey's discovery that a statue of the goddess Fortuna, modeled after Rose, is on display in the British Museum. When the two arrive in Rome, they discover that a nobleman's son has disappeared after modeling for an unlikely sculptor who's all the rage for the lifelike quality in his works. Rose soon discovers that the sculptor's talents stem from sinister motivations, and she and the Doctor are thrust into a time-bending, paradox-forming, high-stakes quest to save the sculptor's victims, oh and the planet too while they're at it. This novel was a nice change of pace setting-wise - I've always enjoyed the television show episodes that allow you to see the Doctor acting within the confines of a historical time period instead of an alien, distant future.  For the most part, I enjoyed this story (though I think Winner is a better effort from Rayner) - the first half of the novel was well-constructed, but the second half falters a bit once the whole time paradox element comes into play. It felt like Rayner didn't quite have the handle on that element of the story that would've been required to pull off the reader's suspension of disbelief successfully. Character-wise, Rayner once again gives an excellent, entirely believable representation of Rose. For the most part I'm also quite pleased with her take on David Tennat's Doctor, though he does become a bit overly melodramatic (particularly during the arena scene). The supporting cast is also solid, particularly Mickey and the new character, GENIE. It's a bit unfortunate that Vanessa's character, around whom so much of the latter half of the story hinges, feels as though it's developed too little, too late. I'm quite pleased with Rayner's ability to bring the Doctor and his companions to life, and I'll definitely be reading more of her Who fiction in the future.ll definitely be reading more of her Who fiction in the future.

0618918248|2.0|As someone who has read Dawkins' earlier work on THE SELFISH GENE, I expected THE GOD DELUSION to be both bright and \\"bright\\" (a propagandistic attempt to use a word to denote atheism and connote intelligence).  Dawkins is a good expositor of and contributor to evolutionary theory and makes a good case for the gene (not the group or the individual) as the primary unit of selection.  But when religion rears its ugly head, Dawkins becomes \\"bright\\"-- and sophomoric.  As a scientist, Dawkins knows that one cannot verify a hypothesis by collecting supportive examples.  One cannot prove that religion is fatally flawed by collecting examples of bad religion.  By their fruits ye shall know them is good advice shared by Jesus, William James (pragmatism) and Dawkins.  Does religion bring \\"more abundant life\\"? is a good question. Toward the end of THE GOD DELUSION (p. 341) Dawkins makes an argument in favor of a religious education-- as literature.  It's good to know about religion as long as you don't believe it.  In the course of that argument, he cites a 1954 Gallup poll indicating that two-thirds of American Catholics and Protestants didn't know who preached the Sermon on the Mount.  But while the \\"brights\\" are enjoying that laugh line, they should consider its implications for their method of judging religion by its wretched fruits: why should the behavior of \\"religious\\" people unfamiliar with religion be regarded as a fruit of religion?  Academic Marxists still discount the fall of Communism as merely the collapse of \\"actually existing\\" (not \\"real\\") Marxism.  Long bread lines are a fruit of \\"Soviet Marxism,\\" not the real thing.  A serious attempt to argue that God is a delusion would pay a great deal of attention to the distinction between actually existing Grand Inquisitors and religion at its best.<br /> Dawkins doesn't do that because he is a ghost buster.  People are frightened into religion and do not understand that they have the choice to leave it.  If \\"brights\\" continue to respect religion, people will continue to be more responsive to their fears than to the rational arguments of the intellectual elites.  Therefore it is necessary to frighten people out of religion.  The \\"God meme\\" replicates itself by making people feel that it is NOT SAFE to reject religion.  The cultural Darwinians must create memes that make people feel that it is not safe TO BE RELIGIOUS.  For example, tell people that subjecting children to religious education is worse than child sexual abuse (p. 317).  Or tell people that those who claim that God permits evil to give people a chance to overcome adversity should rot in Hell (p. 64).  Sophisticated arguments that carry weight with intelligent people don't work with religious crackpots.  Dawkins does not address himself to sophisticated believers, because he does not believe that there are any.  True, he says that \\"science finds itself in alliance with sophisticated theologians like [Dietrich] Bonhoeffer, united against the common enemies of naïve, populist theology and the gap theology of intelligent design.\\"  But any delusion that Dawkins will explain why even sophisticated non-gap theology is still a delusion is quickly dispelled when he says, \\"What worries thoughtful theologians such as Bonhoeffer is that gaps shrink as science advances, and God is threatened with eventually having nothing to do and nowhere to hide\\" (p. 125)  So the table is set, and now Dawkins is going to explain how  Bonhoeffer overcomes that worry and defends Christianity in a scientific age and why that more sophisticated defense nevertheless fails.  Not.  Dawkins says nothing about the defects of sophisticated theology.  Why?  Because, of course, it is not Bonhoeffer's THEOLOGY that Dawkins regards as sophisticated but Bonhoeffer, who-- had he not been executed by the Nazis-- would surely have become a \\"bright.\\"  Nor does Dawkins attempt to address the Christianity of geneticist Francis Collins but tries to outnumber him withtestimonials from \\"bright\\" biologists James Watson and Craig Venter.  (Stalin asked, \\"How many divisions does the pope have?\\"  Is that the level Dawkins feels he must operate on?)<br /> The new ghost busters should stick to their scientific and philosophical work and stop trying to break spells and raise consciousness by being contemptuously disrespectful of religion.  Liberals can't understand why talking down to people doesn't produce more enlightenment.  (But how can we not talk down to them when they are such idiots?)  Dawkins has not tarnished the respectability of religion-- we don't need him to formulate the question any ten-year-old can ask: Who created God?-- but he has tarnished his own respectability by stooping to propagandistic meme-marketing.
0783225857|3.0|This is a great movie.  I feel a bit taken however, since the description of the disk lists it as \\"widescreen\\" 1.85:1.  As far as I can tell, it is a 4:3 digitization letterboxed, and not an anamorphic widescreen.  I expected more from something called the \\"Collector's Edition\\".

Once again, as in the series, the strength of the camaraderie among the team, is the main attraction for me.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|I never thought I would like any BBC period piece better than Pride & Prejudice.  I was wrong.  This 4 hour program is so well done - great acting, a good lesson in the class system, a look at early manufacturing in England.  Best of all, a romance not unlike Pride & Prejudice where there are misundestandings on all sides.  Oh, yes, and Richard Armitage! I thoroughly enjoyed this and recommend it highly!

B000021XS0|4.0|Let me just start by saying that I have not been a DT fan. My son begged me to listen to this CD for years and I kept putting it off. Every time I heard Labrie come in with his awful acapella on Regression, I would reach for the stop button. All I could see in my mind was some Journey wanna be faggin' it up, and my aggro musical tendencies would not stand for that.    I finally got this CD for my B-day and could not put it off anymore. I sat down and popped it in to my stereo, prepared for the torment to begin. As a lover of concept albums, I told myself to just relax and take it for what it is(then if I still don't like it, I can make a coaster out of it!). The tick-tocking started and the hypnotist speaks....So far, so good...Oh God, here it comes....Labrie sounds awful still....How could they let this go on the finished album, I wonder....The overture kicks in and it is Awesome! Maybe this won't be so bad after all. Strange Dejavu...Singing is much better, and in key with the music..nice, not great but listenable. I allow myself to be pulled in to the story and the music. Phenomenal! I love the lyrics and the playing is fabulous. Maybe this really is as great as everyone has been saying... but the singing is just not as good as it could or should be...Oh, well....Arriving at the final track? Already? Wow! That was a fantastic journey! And I hardly noticed Labrie being off key after the opener!    My final impressions: This album is instrumentally and conceptually a masterpiece. The story is original and fascinating. Like PF-The Wall, the ending is unclear and it lets you wonder what the possible outcomes could be. I like that. So why not 5 stars, you ask? Labrie. His singing is uneven and, well, annoying for the first couple of tracks. It then improves, or fades into the background, as the album progresses. I am undecided as to which....I have since explored some other DT releases. The older stuff is very good instrumentally, but I cannot get past the Fag-setto of Labrie. Sorry. I know I should not let this ruin it for me, but it does. He has obviously toned this down since the success of Scenes. I am really enjoying 6 degrees right now and I think he actually sounds pretty good! I will get ToT next. I hear it is heavier and that fits my Prog-metal-aggro personality more than Awake.    So, If you are not sure about this release, and have put off not listening to it for years like me, I suggest you get yourself a copy and be prepared to be impressed. Just bite your hand and plug your ears thru Regression and you will be OK. I promise!

Elend Venture, the new Lord Ruler of Luthadel, clings to power while Luthadel's aristocrats and merchants grumble and two enemy armies, one lead by Elend's father, camp outside the city gates. Fortunately, Elend can rely on help from his unofficial assassin and lover, the young allomancer Vin. Vin's magical metal burning ability makes her a target.

055358894X|1.0|The book was fine if you only care about the action and story.  but in truth the characters were horribly bland, and not because the author gave them bland personalities  it was because his writing offered absolutely no view on their characters inner selfs, what they thought of how they felt.  he hardly ever even told you they were talking with a specific emotions.  the large amount of swearing throughout the bookw as one of the things that gave this book a l ittle b it of color against all that gray,  but most people seemed to hate even that.  I got as far as I could but eventually I found myself reading through words without paying attention to what they were.  I need deeper character development in the novels I read.
B000WTLDPU|5.0|While this movie bears only memories of the Neil Gaiman's very excellent and funny Book, Stardust - it is a wonderful movie, one that you can really get your teeth into - and such great fun. A family(ish) movie, if you have older kids, and one with layers of good humour as well as some pretty Ghoulish stuff to keep you squirming.    It starts, as all stories start, before the story begins - will so says the original book - although I loved the introduction in the movie too! The village of Wall is so named because of the wall which runs along beside it - with a guard to prevent anyone from getting through the wall to Faere on the other side. Dunstan Thorn (played by Prince Caspian actor - Ben Barnes) goes there one evening, jumping through the hole in the wall and ending up back home, and nine months later presented with a baby whose name according to the note is Tristan Thorn.    Tristan (Charlie Cox) grows up rather insipidly pallid, and works in the shop where he longs to marry local girl Victoria (Sienna Miller. She is off-hand and sends him on a quest, through the wall, to find a fallen star.     In Faere on the other side of Wall, Tristan discovers a new world, and that fallen stars are not lumps of rock, but rather beautiful and rather petulant, young women. However he captures her determined to take her back to Wall - to Victoria, to prove his love and to therefore win her hand in Marriage    Unbeknownst to him, there are two other competing groups for the Fallen Star - Yvaine - (Played by Clare Danes). Firstly the competeing Princes of Stormhold, whose father the 81st King has flung the Ruby out the window - of the three sons left whoever gets it first gets to be King in his stead. It is the gem which has Knocked the star out of the sky.    Then there is the Witch (MIchelle Pfeiffer) and her two sisters - called the Lilum in the book - who seek the star to cut out her heart so they can gain their youth and strength. Some of the funniest scenes in the movie are from Pfeiffer who has to be careful about magic as it ages her and she only has so much of the last star's heart to use.    The chase through Faere ensues, and includes a trip on lightening harvester with the wonderful Captain Shakespeare (Robert deNiro) camping it up - and his rough crew \\"arrghhhhhhh!\\" which is great fun.    In the end it is a run to the end, and finding out what stars do best.     While the movie loses some of Yvaines cynical petulance, there are truly wonderful touches in the movie. Not the least is Tristan's transformation in looks and acts from a pasty shop-boy to a confident young man.    I have to confess a deep love for Neil Gaiman and his writing -and while this is not his book, I loved it. A very good fun romp, with sharp twists, almost Roald Dahl-esque justice and humour. And great characterisation from the actors too of course!
B000077VOY|5.0|What more can I say than the title above? Those of us who grew up watching shows like this nowadays wonder what the hell the executives are thinking putting on such crap-ola on TV and expect children to watch what they produce. Cartoon Network = CRAP !!!!!!!!
B0011NVC9I|5.0|This is not Beowulf, the classic poem which has been so beautifully translated by Seamus Heaney - or written for children by Michael Morpunga (sp) - however as a version of Beowulf displaying the strength, bravado, and weaknesses of Beowulf and the grim nature of Danish and Geat kingdoms, this is an extraodinary telling.    I wondered how much Neil Gaiman had in the telling - certainly through Zemeckis, this version has a great deal of humanity, as well as humour. I really enjoyed it as arip roaring tale. I certainly wouldn't have bothered watching it at all if I hadn't caught part of it on the telly - after that I had to seek out the DVD.     I thought the animation would be distracting, and it does have a flatness to it - but it also allows the telling of the story with its fantasy elements, to develop beautifully.    In this version the boastful, strong but hearty Beowulf is travelling from Geatland to the Danish kingdom of Hrothgar's where the meadhall Heoror has been plagued by a Hell-born monster - Grendel. For 14 years Grendel has ruled the hall and the land of the Danes by night. Hrothgar, an old king with a young wife, has had no answer to it.    In the early stages Beowulf boasts of his feats of strength - killing sea monsters and so on - and his crew and men mock him but not to his face. In fact Beowulf, like many egotists seems completely ignorant of their laughter and their inside knowledge that his boasts are inflated.    Key elements in the story are changed. Grendel is altered from a Hell-born beast intent on destroying pleasure, happiness and all that is good and essentially godly - he is a simple creature - he seems to be simply motivated by hunger and simple stupidity rather than hate.    Beowulf defeats him, naked - and the scenes leading up to the fight are some of the most hilarious - with handily placed drinking cups and so on to conceal his anatomy - a bit reminscent of Austin Powers movies.    After the defeat the movie departs from the original story of Beowulf almost completely. However the re=written story has an immensely powerful theme - and is very reminiscent of King Arthur tales, of weakness and power. Interesting that both Arthur and Beowulf are similar in time, set around the 5th and 6th centuries. Now the King Hrothgar kills himself and Beowulf takes over the kingdom - yet you see that his fate begins to echo that of Hrothgar's.    The question of what or who is Grendel and his mother - and how did they get there is answered in this story - and the Mallory 'Wheel of time' style telling of the story brings things into a full cycle. It is a very clever motif and development.    The actors used for the characters, Ray Winstone, Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich especially do an extraodinary job - and the animation was extremely well done.     I am really in awe of this movie. Not classic Beowulf, as I said, but a classic in its own right.
B000WC3AKI|5.0|I admit that some of the story lines are not true when it comes defining some of the events that occur in the movie, since I work with the NWS. But it's NOT a documentary ! It's a movie !....and should be viewed as such. This is a very good movie because no one has been able to put together a movie as this one was with the excellent special effects. Do not watch any other movie that has been copycated on TV movies or cable...none of those even measure up. Although sequels never measure up to the original, I'm looking forward to 'Twister II' eventually coming to theaters in the next few years.

Initially, she is very homesick, but slowly learns to adjust to her new life and her new independence.  Having fallen in love with an Italian (shock!), she suddenly finds that she must return to Ireland to deal with a death in the family.  There, she must confront her family's expectations for her future, and well as her own.<br /><br />As with all T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's books, this one deals primarily with the themes of privacy and distance, particularly distance between family members.  It isn't so much that people WANT to keep secrets, as that it seems not to occur to them to share their feelings or to discuss their lives.<br /><br />As usual, also, T&oacute;ib&iacute;n writing is perceptive and thoughtful.  His descriptions of Eilis' seasickness on the journey over and her homesickness are unerring.  Here he is on homesickness:  \\"She was nobody here.  It was not just that she had no friends and family; it was rather that she was a ghost in this room, in the streets on the way to work, on the shop floor.  Nothing meant anything.  The rooms in the house on Friary Street belonged to her, she thought; when she moved in them she was really there.  In the town, if she walked to the shop or to the Vocational School, the air, the light, the ground, it was all solid and part of her, even if she met no one familiar.  Nothing here was part of her.  It was false, empty, she thought.\\"<br /><br />Though this is not my favorite of T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's books, I would certainly recommend it.  (A not-great book of T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's is better than most writers' best.)
1416955070|4.0|I stumbled on this in the supermarket while looking for something to pass a weekend of house-sitting. Didn't even realize it was a young adult book. I enjoyed that the characters, while young, generally sounded like adults instead of whining children. A slightly different twist on the supernatural world that keeps you interested.
B001CC7PPI|5.0|I teach this work as the pinnacle of Hitchcock's oeuvre in a film class, and I can literally watch it back-to-back, once every 10 weeks, and not get tired of it. It is so fantastically done on all fronts that it holds up beyond nearly all other popular films in the history of cinema.<br /><br />This is a well-done DVD with a truly fascinating doc on the second disk that gives all kinds of great inside information about not only the work itself, but Hitchcock's methods. My caveat is for the DVD transfer. One of my students worked for years at a restoration facility and when I showed him this DVD, he made disgusted noises at the cheap quality of the digital transfer. Apparently this is the way it's done nowadays because studios are too cheap to go in by hand and restore 35mm, so the pixillation is noticeable during dolly and panning shots, as are the fluctuations in color. However, this isn't exactly a posh Blu-Ray, and I suppose we should be thankful the Hitchcock 5 exist in the public domain at all, so 5 stars it is. :)
B0017PCW62|5.0|This album is not for the faint of heart but if you are brave and open to truly excellent and emotionally raw and vibrant music then you need to give this a try. I originally bought this in it's original release in the early 1990's as I had first heard the music while getting my one and only tattoo.  I'll buy this again as a gift for the serious music fan in my life but I stress that most can't handle the truth in the lyrics or the raw intensity of the vocals.  But if you have strength and want to take a walk on the wild side of truth this is for you.
B001FB4W0W|3.0|I am one of those people who read and loved Charlaine Harris's books before watching the show. After hearing True Blood's rave reviews, I was excited to see it when it came out on DVD. Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations.<br /><br />Let me start with the positives. The show creators did mostly good casting job. Actors playing Bill, Pam, Arlene, Sam, and even Sookie delivered great performances and looked pretty much like I imagined them. I enjoyed seeing some of my favorite scenes come to life - trips to Fangtasia, Sookie's and Bill's meeting at Merlotte's, etc. Some moments created by writers (for instance, a flashback into Bill's past) were very interesting too.<br /><br />On the other side, it was painful to see what had become of Charlaine's world in this acclaimed TV series. Somehow small Louisiana town of Bon Temps came of as a \\"nest\\" of sex-crazed low-lives.  Jason instead of a charming womanizer was portrayed as a stupid drug-obsessed man whore, Bill became way too sullen and even violent, Sookie appeared to be a halfwit. I missed chemistry and love between Sookie and Bill. Their relationship unfortunately looked like the one between a fangbanger and a user-vampire. Also, was it necessary to fill the series with so much sex? I am no prude, but I do not think Jason's weekly sexcapades added anything to the story. Made-up side story lines of perpetually whining Tara and male prostitute and drug-dealer Lafayette also only added to the general air of nastiness of the fantasy universe created in the series.<br /><br />In spite of all these negatives, I will still check out season two. Maybe the series will finally take a right direction, lighten up on gratuitous sex and concentrate more on the great material provided by Charlaine Harris.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|Even if you are not a fan of both of the main actors you won't be able to deny how majestic and striking the film is.  Worth taking the time to see and you will learn a lot about Austrailia's part in the war as well as it's cattle ranching history.  All the characters were vibrant and I found myself riveted to the screen during the movie....had to buy a copy for my own collection.
B001FB55HG|3.0|In my opinion, compared to this year's other additions to popular franchises, \\"Terminator Salvation\\" stands somewhere above \\"Wolverine\\" but below \\"Star Trek.\\" This movie had so much promise, but sadly fell flat.<br /><br />On the bright side, the movie looked good, it had excellent special effects and some great action scenes, it was able to hold my attention almost throughout.<br /><br />On the other hand, it could have been so much better! First of all, the script needed some major work - the story was so muddled in the beginning, it was hard to stay interested. It was my impression the movie  was supposed to be about John Connor, however, somewhere along the way my attention totally shifted to Marcus - half-robot/half-human - and his journey to find out what had happened to him. I found myself much more interested in him rather than John Connor, his wife, resistance, or Kyle. Considering that Marcus was meant to be a secondary character, it is very sad, isn't it? The story should have been more focused and followed the scheme of first 3 Terminator movies.<br /><br />Secondly, I am getting sick of directors putting characters in the movies only to be politically correct or in attempt to attract different demographics. I am talking about characters of Common and silent girl that didn't serve any kind of purpose.<br /><br />Finally, I have to agree with many reviewers that the world after the Judgment day didn't look quite like the one portrayed in previous Terminator movies.  The Resistance seemed to have as much resources (weapons, helicopters) as Skynet; the survivors were way too good-looking, rested and clean. Well, you get the picture.<br /><br />Overall, it was an OK movie. I enjoyed some parts of it, mainly toward the end. I am grateful that a new noteworthy actor was introduced to us - Sam Worthington who played Marcus. I think he \\"owned\\" this movie. It is curious if this franchise will go on though, I heard it was meant to make three new Terminator movies.....
0385338732|2.0|The story line was trite and sophomoric. When it is appropriate to the character and plot I am not averse to reading curse words in books. However I found the author's over use of dropping \\"F-Bombs\\" off putting. It made me cringe to see it used so often. (Besides, there are some great curse words that don't employ the use of F-word.) I found the characters of Fi  and Amy to be the most appealing. The scene where Amy is found to be \\"knicking\\" stuff from Lexi's home to be very funny.
B00000IMYA|4.0|I purchased this item primarily for use in a college jazz history class. The quality is excellent and I'm delighted to be able to bring this historically important performance to life for my students.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n's \\"Children of Men\\" is a horrifying vision of how the world could end if no more children were born.  Extremely provocative, this film made me realize how important children are to our future.  Without them, the world becomes psychologically insane before dying a physical death.<br /><br />  Mother Nature has imposed her own form of birth control on mankind.  At first, a few women began miscarrying, then hundreds more until it became a world-wide epidemic.  It is now the year 2027 and a child has not been born in eighteen years; despair and grief has led the world to the brink of total destruction.  Every country, except Britain, seems to have collapsed.  The British government has launched a campaign to rid the country of all illegal immigrants known as Fugees.  One of these Fugees is a pregnant girl, Joy.  Theo Faron (Clive Owen of \\"Derailed\\") struggles to help her get safely to a boat owned by Operation Humanity.  Unfortunately, a terrorist group, the Fishes, wants to use Joy's baby as a pawn for its diabolical plans against the British government.<br /><br />  \\"Children of Men\\" is highly recommended for fans of apocalyptic, end-of-the-world horror.  Extremely tense and war-like in its graphic depiction of street violence, this film is highly emotional.  Not easily forgotten, it will leave you asking, \\"Could this really happen?\\"  One touching scene that made me cry was when Joy's baby was being carried out of a destroyed building.  The tenants stood spellbound, gaping and murmuring, \\"A baby.  A baby,\\" as they remembered a world that was long gone.  A political statement as well as a disaster film, \\"Children of Men\\" should be added to your science fiction/horror/adventure collection.
0765348276|3.0|I've read little in the military SF genre, so take my comments as coming from one unfamiliar with the terrain.  The premise here is intriguing, and after seeing all the positive reviews on Amazon I thought it would be hard to go wrong.  I've got mixed feelings having read it.<br /><br />Scalzi gives us a character driven story, pure gold concept, and imaginative tech that never gets in the way of the drama.  The narrative is clear and crisp, especially in action sequences, and the dialog is generally good.  Unfortunately, the philosophical material isn't exploited for what it's worth.  What is there feels forced.  Our hero's commit genocide without thinking twice, develop a conscience when the story asks for it, then lose it again when the story needs to move on.  The progression comes off ham handed.  There are moving moments, but the characters never feel truly real.  And despite the cool concepts and loads of action, most of the book has a dull feel to it.  It picks up toward the end with some good battle scenes and an unexpected plot development, but it's just not a big enough payoff to call this book great.<br /><br />All of the ingredients for greatness are here.  I'm left thinking this could have been an all time classic if it had stayed in the oven for a few more revs.
B000B5IPDI|4.0|A Cult film, that is.  A wonderfully non-conventional bit of story-telling that should be thoroughly enjoyed! Why settle for a \\"just-the-facts-ma'am\\" kind of life when you can add so much more to the story in the telling.  Edward Bloom (Ewan McGregor/Albert Finney) becomes the quintessential opposite of Charles Dicken's Josiah Bounderby of \\"Hard Times.\\"  In \\"Big Fish\\" the facts, like gold, are where you find them, and Edward Blooms endless stream of \\"fish stories\\" may have more facts than his son, William (Billy Crudup) is willing to credit them for.  So William, tired of dad's \\"fish stories,\\" goes on a fact-finding mission to learn where his father's reality ends and where truth begins. What the son learns changes everything for him, maybe you too.  Worth more than one viewing, so it's worth owning!
B001FB55HG|4.0|Months before the release of the latest entry in the Terminator franchise the movie's leading man Christian Bale was out creating negative buzz for the movie when the press found out about his onset meltdown thanks in part to TMZ somehow getting their hands on a tape of his profanity laced on set rant which was directed at the film's Cinematographer.   This lead many to speculate if Bale wasn't just playing crazy in the film \\"American Psycho\\" especially since Bale had previously been arrested for allegedly assaulting his mother and sister in 2008.   The question was soon raised would Bale's behavior cause some people to not watch his latest film?  Outside of this negative buzz surrounding the film's leading man there was the issue of the disastrous film Terminator 3:  Rise of the Machines (2003).   Would this terrible movie still be fresh in the minds of many movie goers and prevent many from giving T4 a fair chance?    The answer to both questions is yes.  Personally, I have no problem with Bale I think he's a talented and intense actor.    The only reason I wrestled with the idea of not taking a chance on this film for awhile had to do with my opinion of T3, which I think is one of the worst movies ever made.   I eventually opted to see T4 in the theatres for appreciation of the greatness of what writer-director James Cameron created 25 years ago with Terminator and his follow-up to his masterpiece Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991).    Sure, I knew that James Cameron wasn't involved in the writing or the making of the fourth film, but still the potential for greatness was there.  Luckily this potential was realized in this film.  This time around the setting is the bleak future that you've been hearing about and which was briefly glimpsed in all the other films.   The year is 2018 and John Connor is FINALLY an adult (33 to be exact).  While he's not quite the true leader of the resistance yet except in spirit he is still able to inspire people around him.     Muchlike the first 2 films this movie features well done action sequences that get this are filmed without the amateurish- shaky camera work seen in such abysmal films as Aliens vs. Predator and the Resident Evil films.  The action scenes are not only well choreographed and filmed well they are also entertaining to watch.    T4 pays homage to the other Terminator films in subtle but recognizable ways.  If you recall in T2 they show a 44 year old John Connor with a scar on his face leading human forces against the machines.  T4 shows Terminator fans just how he got that scar.  Also a few popular Terminator quotes are nicely incorporated in the film, they use Linda Hamilton's voice and picture as Sarah Connor in ways that fit nicely into the story, the film also as some scenes reminiscent of Cameron's Terminator movies, and a there is also an unexpected, but much welcomed cameo.     This movie also showcases the talents of 2 male actors who have the potential to go on to become big stars.  These men are attractive but relatively unknown Aussie Sam Worthington who makes a good impression with his portrayal of Marcus Wright.  In fact Worthington is so good in his part that he steals with show from Christian Bale.  This is not to say that Bale does a bad job, because he does a good job in the role of the charismatic John Connor it's just that Worthington brought a lot more to his character.   The other talented male actor worth looking out for is Anton Yelchin who plays a young Kyle Reese (he also plays Chekov in the new Star Trek film).  Yelchin plays his part in the film in a heartfelt and convincing manner.  He is 100% believable as a teenage Kyle Reese.    While the movies special effects don't have the original 2 films wow factors since those films were doing something brand new and innovative when they were made T4's special effects are still astonishing nonetheless.        I would recommend people watch this film. This includes fans of the James' Cameron Terminator movies, Terminator fans in general as well as the casual movie-goer. It's definitely a worthy addition to the franchise and happens to be a good summer action flick in general that's worth your time and money.        Rating:  B+
0553801503|2.0|In the first three books of The Song of Ice and Fire, George R. R. Martin crafted an intricate, gritty world tilting (perhaps inevitably) towards darkness and the oncoming winter.  Those three books are populated by fascinating, evolving characters and convoluted plots and intrigue.  Unfortunately for the reader, \\"A Feast for Crows\\" (the fourth book in the series), while in theory set in the same world, is a sad departure from the previous three in the series.  Rather than focusing upon the characters we have grown to know and love -- Bran, Arya, Jon, Tyrion, and a handful of others -- Martin instead decides to spend virtually the entire book on the B-cast (paranoid Cersei, cowardly Samwell, noble-but-ugly Brienne) and a host of one-chapter nobodies.  (Seriously, did anyone care about Sir What's-His-Name's short-lived adventures in the South?)  Very few of these secondary stories are played out to any satisfying conclusion, and so most of \\"A Feast for Crows\\" feels like a holding pattern.    This is intensified by the fact that Martin has been held up by writer's block for so long.  He wrote and published the first three books in the series in 1996, 1998, and 2000 respectively, but there was a five-year gap between the third book (\\"A Storm of Swords\\") and the fourth.  With time stretching towards another five-year gap in publication for the fifth book in the series, readers can only hope that Martin concludes the epic in a timely and satisfying fashion.
032147404X|5.0|I bought this book upon the excellent reviews here in amazon.com, honestly, i benefited from the book, let's say 60%, as I already know the other 40%.<br /><br />This book is an excellent choice to read when you have an interest in photography. It's very easy, direct to the point, and delivers the receipe of many photos that when you see, you just say, WooooW.<br /><br />So recommended.
B001HN697M|3.0|I loved the movie trailers and could not wait to see this. Unfortunately, I have a 2-year old and this was not a family movie- so I had to wait a bit longer for it to come out on DVD. I have to say I'm disappointed. I loved the first two and had high hopes for Rise of the Lycans. It was good, but I was left wanting more. More action, more Lucian, more lycan scenes, more Rhona, just more. I like how it was done in the same thread as the first two: dark, up-close fighting scenes, great characters and story; but as I was coming to the end, I thought, \\"This can't be all?\\". Overall, being a fan of the Underworld series, I didn't like it, like it, but did not hate it either: so three stars for being okay.
B001TOD92C|5.0|Not only do I think that this was the greatest movie of 2008, but the Wrestler climbed up to the be one of my all time favorite movies. It hits my heart that only few have done.  I recieved the movie in a few days from ordering it, everything was awesome

B001FB55M6|2.0|I love Jim Carrey - he's a rare talent - up there with Robin Williams in terms of wit, intelligence and acting capability - but that doesn't save \\"Yes Man\\" from being an awful film.<br /><br />It must have seemed like a good idea as a screenplay at the time - he has to say 'yes' to everything - which will of course lead to all manner of hilarity. But mostly the jokes and sketches are wooden and fall flat on silence time after time after time. There's also a rather stupid and crude pun throughout about a certain regional accent. At times it seems like Hollywood just doesn't know what funny is anymore, except to be gross-out or crass or take the piss out of easy targets. My wife and daughter sat watching this with me - and asked several times how this dog got made - that's how bad it is...<br /><br />The Blu Ray print is superb, but after a while that doesn't matter as you wished you'd hired something else.<br /><br />Buy \\"The Truman Show\\" or \\"Eternal Sunshine...\\" or \\"Lemony Snickett\\" - Carey has done so much better than this.<br /><br />One to avoid I'm afraid...
0738711500|4.0|The Easy Tarot set was the book and deck set that I picked to be my entrance into the world of tarot. I was drawn to the beautifully illustrated images of the Gilded Tarot (the name of the deck included) and decided that it was to be my first. Seeing as I was a total beginner, the title of the book seemed appropriate and I was confident it could get me off to a great start.<br />Set comes in a nice volume shaped package with the book, the deck, and a poster of the Celtic Cross spread inside. The deck did not disappoint- the cards are colorful, vibrant, smooth, and magnificently illustrated to draw the reader in.<br /><br />The book, however, was off base. \\"Learn to Read Once and For All\\"? Not so much. It's a good introduction and a good push in the right direction, but if you are a beginner you will find yourself having to look up classes on the internet or go searching for another instructional book to read to get any further. Also, the author gives her own interpretation of each of the cards- these are not really to the point, and they do not necessarily match up with the classic meanings or interpretations. I found myself throwing the book aside and looking up the meanings on the internet to make sense of my spreads. Her study methods are also questionable. She would have you write while speaking allowed every description and interpretation of every one of the seventy-eight cards, which makes up about 100 of the 223 pages in the booklet. A straight forward way of learning, but.. there are better ways.<br /><br />If I were to give individual reviews I would give the The Gilded Tarot by Ciro Marchetti five stars and Easy Tarot Handbook by Josephine Ellershaw a two and a half or three stars.<br />In my opinion? If you want the deck, buy it individually and save the rest of your money to get a more comprehensive book on the tarot. But if you don't mind spending a little extra, it's a good first step for absolute beginners.

B0013FDM7E|4.0|Imagine going everywhere you used to go to, and never encounter another living human. Robert Neville does.

B001NFNFNA|5.0|Changeling is a psychological movie. It depicts the life of a mother, who was struggling to survive in her work life as well as being a single mother. It happened at a time that society was young and forming, it does not have many rules and regulations to protect the young kids, such as staying at home without the baby sitter. It depicts the life of how public authorities draw conclusions and tries to solve missing persons dilemma and tried to look good to the public, sacrificing the pursuit of the truth. In all, I am learning that when one is under pressure one is able to admit falsehood just to keep life going...
B001FB55HG|2.0|Yes, it's true, Christian Bale reprises his Bat-voice (\\"I do not have throat cancer!\\"  *punch*  - see YouTube Joker Interrogation video) as the future John Conners here in this disappointing reboot of the Terminator franchise, playing the role much as he would have the Dark Knight.  Bale spends much of the movie yelling at the top of his Bat-voice, often times for no good reason.<br /><br />This movie helped to remind me that although I have eagerly anticipated all the Terminator sequels, I have been disappointed by all of them to varying degrees since the original classic.  None of the subsequent films have had the same sort of emotional connection to the central characters that the first Terminator movie had.  The love story of Kyle Reese and Sarah Conner and their appealing nature, together with Arnold's scary-hilarious turn as the Terminator, was what made the first movie in this franchise so special.<br /><br />In this movie, none of the characters are given enough time or dialogue that we ever care anything about them.  The few good bits with the Marcus Wright and Blair Williams characters are cut short and kept too sparse to fill them out either.<br /><br />The movie lacks originality - some of the scenes are recycled/copied from other movies - the scene of the fireball explosions in the trees by the river is from \\"Apocalypse Now\\", the tension of waiting for the industrial elevator scene is from \\"Aliens\\", the robot frozen in place only to break free is from \\"Terminator 2\\".<br /><br />And so this movie becomes just another hyperkinetic action movie, with lots of fighting, explosions, car crashes, and scary robots chasing after scared humans.<br /><br />Even as an action movie, this movie suffers as many of the action sequences didn't make sense.  There is almost no sense of continuity in the action in large parts of this movie as cuts from one set to another are completely disconnected.  For example, in the opening sequence, we go from what looks like a radio telescope farm in the desert, which has become a battlefield, to John Conner rappelling down a giant hole/tunnel  in the ground which has suddenly appeared,  to a dark tunnel/sewage system filled with water (what's that doing in a desert?),  to a dark laboratory filled with bodies on lab tables, to a dark prison filled with human prisoners, to a clean and shiny computer center.  And then all of a sudden John Conner is seen climbing back up again to the first set, the radio telescope farm in the desert, except mysteriously, everybody around him is dead.<br /><br />The final fight scenes at SkyNet were equally baffling, as the fighting moves back and forth between what looks like a steel foundry (where else would you find a vat of molten iron?), a robot factory, a prison for humans, and a computer center.  WTF?<br /><br />The location of John Conners's resistance section varies from an air base to this dark underground cave-like warren to this rather elaborate mined compound with watchtowers and barbed wire, all located next to a river that is filled with angry Hydrobots.  WTF again?  Nothing connects!  Just what the heck is the human resistance doing with helicopters and A-10 aircraft on an air base anyway?  I thought this was supposed to be the post-nuclear holocaust human society - you simply cannot hide an air base, or any sort of fixed command base from nuclear weapons!<br /><br />Isn't there something in Basic Filmaking 101 that tells you how to get scenes to connect?<br /><br />I must admit that I love this franchise - it's really the memories of the very first movie that keeps me going in spite of all the disappointments.  And so I forced myself to sit through another viewing of this movie ..... and promptly fell asleep during parts of the second viewing.  All the loud explosions, the yelling, and the noise, just got surprisingly repetitive and boring.<br /><br />One can blame the poor characterizations and lousy plot on the scriptwriters. One can blame Christian Bale's ego for staying on his one-note crusade as Batman in this movie.  But when the movie fails even to keep you awake in its basic role as a thrilling action adventure movie, there is only one three letter word that you can blame for this whole mess:<br /><br />McG<br /><br />I do hope this franchise continues with a better director and better scriptwriting (if you're going to make a movie with giant robots, why not Michael Bay? and yes, McG definitely is losing in his spat with Bay).<br /><br />Although this is a weak reboot, the Terminator franchise has such a strong foundation that much can be done to improve things in the future.  Christian Bale is a terrific actor - he just needs a strong director to tell him to ACT instead of yell and play Batman all the time.  The Marcus Wright and Blair Williams characters introduced here in this movie also have much potential for the future.<br /><br />Here's hoping...n in this movie.

0452286751|5.0|It is difficult to summarize what \\"The Fountainhead\\" by Ayn Rand is about.  The simplest explanation is that it is about an architect named Howard Roark who saw the world very differently than others did and the people who are intent upon destroying him.  But simplifying the premise down to that sentence does Ayn Rand an injustice.  For \\"The Fountainhead\\" is an examination of society and individualism and it touches on themes that greatly exceed the reach of its characters.<br /><br />The readers are first introduced to Howard Roark on the day he is expelled from Stanton Institute of Technology for refusing to conform to their expectations of architecture.  For Roark believes that buildings should be built based on personality and purposes, as well as from the land that surrounds it.  His ideas are revolutionary in an era when architects were expected to draw upon all the preceeding styles to build their own greatness.  Roark's struggle to establish himself as a worthy architect who should be allowed to build things his own way is contrasted with the meteoric rise of Peter Keating, whom Roark had boarded with during college.  Keating conforms to every expectation, becomes wealthy and famous, but knows that he will never measure up to Howard Roark and will always be a mediocre architect.<br /><br />As the world slowly begins to accept the idea of modernism in architecture, Roark becomes a major league player in the building business, a rise that several people try to destroy.  Dominique Francon, the woman who loves Roark but cannot choose him, sets out to destroy his prospects by winning jobs for Peter Keating, among other attempts to hurt him.  But the real threat lies with Ellsworth Toohey, a philanthropist and self-fashioned expert on architecture who writes a column in the most popular newspaper of the day.  He recognizes Roark's genius but knows that it goes against every grain of information he has brainwashed his readers into believing, so he does all in his power to conserve his anonymity and bring him disgrace.  Yet in spite of all these obstacles, Roark continues to fight for what he knows to be his personal truth, no matter what losses and battles get thrown his way.<br /><br />\\"The Fountainhead\\" by Ayn Rand is an intriguing read, but definitely not one that is fast-paced.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|Got the DVD set for the wife. She loves the novels and she loved the series when it aired on HBO.<br /><br />I'm puzzled by the packaging. Wished HBO had used slim cases for the DVDs instead of that old-fashioned fold-out packaging.
B000VNMMPM|5.0|Stunningly surreal and deeply touching French movie about the fateful encounter of a hopeless man called Andrea with a female angel called Angela. Both humorously met as they were about to jump off a bridge in Paris. Lady jumps off, man saves her from drowning and later discovers that life is more than just chasing money, clearing off debts, and a cycle of misery.<br /><br />Angel Angela teaches Andre to pause and take a breather, to rediscover the simple things in life, to get his self-esteem and confidence back in reality by being honest, truthful and discerning about the people he surrounds himself with. In helping Andre to uncover self-love from within himself, he grew to love her whilst reframing his limited outlook of his world of misery. Though penniless, he found joy with Angela who disclosed that she is an angel from heaven. When and after she had helped him clear off his debts with his hoodlum pursuers, he discovers that he has fallen in love with her and finds his only meaning in life as long as she is with him. She gradually feels the same way too, but being an angel, she has to leave him as soon as her mission was complete. Watch the movie to see how this love story ends!<br /><br />What makes this movie a great one? Besides the awesome looks of its sexy lead actress, the themes taught throughout the movie reflects on our modern realities as a wake-up call to reflect, discover and learn that the fullness of life is more than about the endless pursuit of money and accumulation of material tangibilities. It's what's inside your soul that matters much more than your earthly wealth, this is a timeless truth that many people today fail to learn till after their physical death.<br /><br />Love yourself, share your love and gifts with others.

B001T0I7LY|5.0|The Hungry Planet is most familiar for the photos of some thirty families from very different cultural traditions, each posed with a display of their week's supply of food. The book elaborates on this with many photos of the families at home, at work, at play, in the kitchen, at the market, in the garden. The accompanying reading enhances the experience but is not so extensive as to interrupt the pictures which are the main attraction. It's a wonderful book to share with anyone but especially with youngsters who are old enough to appreciate the variety of human tastes and experiences.
B000002BE9|5.0|All of her cds are amazing. It's as if she's ripping out a piece of her life and showing her bare soul in each song. She's so open with her emotions and honest about her vulnerabilities. I've seen her interviewed and she's a lot like myself. Unable to express herself verbally but on paper she's a mastermind. Her music forces you to open your mind and not take her words as they come surface wise. She's deep and you have to dig for the meaning through her clever metaphors. For the people who asked does she play piano, yes she does. On youtube there is a video of her at 6 or 7 playing the piano for her father. She's always been very talented, different and wise beyond her years.        If you love poetry, you'll love all of her albums. She writes every song and is NOT manufactured.

B000OPOAM0|5.0|\\"The Terminator\\" blends science fiction and horror into a non-stop classic film.  James Cameron's budget was beyond low but he succeeded in bringing the scares with brutal violence and breathless action.  The time travel storyline is simple here and it actually makes sense.  The characters act and react in what would probably be logical ways, given that they have a nearly indestructible killer cyborg stalking them.  And speaking of the cyborg, Arnold Schwarzenegger was perfect for this role.  He's a huge, hulking mass and is intimidating to say the least.<br /><br />The special effects are dated by today's standards, but if you're a fan of stop-action animation, there's some very cool scenes to drool over.  There is also some great model and old school puppet work, highlighted by the Terminator cutting into his arm and eyeball to do a few repairs.  Speaking of that, even though this film is very violent, the blood, gore and language is milder than you'd expect.  \\"The Terminator\\" is one of the greats of sci-fi cinema.  It always entertains and is endlessly re-watchable.
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|The picture quality on all the movies in this box is simply amazing. There is a certain amount of grain in all of them but, I think, this is just normal film grain.    The cover box is a bit flimsy and not glued on properly although this could just be a 1 off thing.    All in all this box set is really worth the price.

B000RMQH30|5.0|Lifeline is, at least for now, Ben Harper's last recording with The Innocent Criminals, but this ensemble certainly gives a good account of themselves.  Lifeline is an acoustic leaning effort that is for the most part upbeat and fun.  It gets off to a great start with \\"Fight Outta You\\" with its acoustic groove and message of encouragement - \\"They'll look you in the eyes and stone you/Then turn and disown you/Don't let 'em take the fight outta you\\".  While it may seem odd to associate acoustic with energy, this song combines them nonetheless.  However, don't expect to stay at a fevered pitch for the entire CD.  \\"In The Colors\\" immediately dials things down to a much more mellow song to someone that Harper wants to \\"Dance with me into the colors of the dusk\\".  Harper also delivers some clever lyrics on \\"Say You Will\\".  I loved the second verse \\"Like Marie Antoinette said to Louis XVI/Man I think we're going down./Our chances are slim and none/And I'm afraid slim just left town\\".  Even the songs that aren't as upbeat such as \\"Fool For A Lonesome Train\\" and the instrumental \\"Lifeline\\" are still done in a way that is neither brooding nor self-absorbed.  There really isn't a bad song on the CD.  So, if you're looking for acoustic jams, clever lyrics, and an overall positive vibe, give Lifeline a try.  I think you'll like it.<br /><br />Download this:  Fight Outta You

6305657947|3.0|Slick, stylish remake of 1968 film which had Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway in lead roles. This time we have Irish actor Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo in a formula love story similar in many aspects to James Bond movies from the late 90s, which coincidentally starred Pierce Brosnan.    If you want a safe, entertaining movie to watch with a girfriend or wife then this fits the bill. Don't be deceived by the art-heist caper as it is simply a hook to connect billionaire Wall Street crook Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) with insurance investigator Catherine Banning (Rene Russo). Females love Rene because she is not a stunning, hot-body and provides subliminal hope to all average looking girls.     In reality this is just an old-fashioned Hollywood love story in which rich playboy falls for poor, working girl. He dazzles her with expensive restaurants, jewelry and trips. She pretends to play hard-to-get but in the end succumbs to his money and lifestyle. Story ends with them embracing and kissing.    In spite of slick production and excellent direction by John McTiernan, the script by Leslie Dixon and Kurt Wimmer has glaring problems. Leslie wrote the love scenes and Kurt the action sequences. Approximately 12 minutes into the film and two days after the heist of a $100 million Claude Monet painting from a New York City musuem, insurance investigator Rene Russo while guzzling a can of Pepsi One in a New York Police Department precinct office has a mind-boggling revelation: billionaire Wall Street financier Thomas Crown is the thief. She rushes to a computer terminal and with four keystrokes generates a report about all top bidders at worldwide auctions during the previous five years for Claude Monet paintings. Voila, Thomas Crown is consistently among the top bidders.    Then with nothing more than the auction report and her feminine intuition, Rene confronts Pierce. And, so begins the cat-and-mouse romance. Rene has a dossier about Pierce and Pierce a dossier about Rene.She is from a poor family in Lima, Ohio and has clawed her way into the world of high-paid of insurance investigators with a gig for some rich Swiss. Yadda, yadda, yadda.    After dancing the tango, he asks if she \\"wants to dance or wants to dance?\\" They rush to his luxurious Brownstone in the upper 60s (streets) off Park Avenue in Manhattan and fornicate on the stairs leading to his bedroom and then again on a desk in his home office. Rene or her body double shows bare breasts.     Shortly thereafter, they fly a glider plane and then fly by private jet to the Caribbean island of Martinique for a romantic tryst.     Of course, he has fallen in love with her and to seal the relationship promises to return the stolen painting. But, she cannot forsake her alleged ideals and commitment to her employer, so she tips the New York Police Department about his plan to return the painting to the museum during the day, just before her planned elopement with Pierce.  However, Pierce assumes such and brazenly outwits the NYPD by mysteriously infiltrating dozens of similarly dressed men into the museum. NYPD detectives are reduced to bumbling idiots and Rene is happy. As she sneaks away to rendezvous with Pierce, the chief detective tells her to say hello to Pierce.     Rene rushes to meet Pierce at the East River heliport in Manhattan but Pierce is not there as promised. Rene proceeds to JFK airport and boards a United Airlines flight to London. After the plane departs she begins crying. A man in the seat behind her offers a hankerchief. Yes, it is Pierce. Somehow, he either followed her or knew she would flee to London. Somehow he knew she would fly United Airlines rather the more popular British Airways, Virgin Air or American Airlines. Somehow he managed to obtain the seat behind her. And, somehow he managed to board without her noticing.     End of story as they embrace and kiss and she promises to break both his arms if he ever pulls another similar stunt. Most females in the audience will have tears in their eyes. All I can think is that I write free reviews and two writers got paid $1 million for writing trite cliches.    This film premiered during 1999 with a mild box-office opening of $14.6 million in the USA. Eventually after two years it generated worldwide box-office revenues of $124 million. However, it was far overshadowed by the World Is Not Enough, the James Bond film starring Pierce, which opened in the USA during early November 1999 with an initial weekend gross of $35 million and then went on to become the then biggest-grossing James Bond film with worldwide theatrical revenue of $362 million.     Pierce began playing James Bond in Goldeneye which was released during 1995. He was the fifth actor playing Bond and replaced Timothy Dutton. You can see much of the James Bond films in the Thomas Crown Affair, especially since Pierce also produced the Thomas Crown film.     However, as with the first Thomas Crown Affair film, it is superficial like a stunning, mindless blonde bimbo or male model. Beneath the surface are the usual cliches giving hope to all poor girls dreaming of escape from poverty by marrying a rich man and living happily after. Such nonsense is being perpetuated by alleged music cable channel VH1 which for the 2009-2010 season is offering psuedo-reality show \\"Megan Wants To Marry A Millionaire.\\" I wonder if Megan is going to fornicate on second dates like Rene and Pierce?    Pierce since 1999 has been trying to produce Thomas Crown Affair 2 and during 2009 said that if it did not go into production during 2009 that it would probably never happen. After ten years, I suspect that few people care. And, apparently the Thomas Crown Affair with Pierce and Rene is no longer a hot commodity considering the low price on Amazon for used DVDs in very good condition. That says more than all the glowing reviews by Pierce and Rene fans.     By the way, I formerly worked for a very rich man who had a world class art collection and regularly bought at worldwide auctions. He never attended such and never bought in his name which is standard practice for the ultra-rich. First and foremost he did not want rivals to know he was pursuing any artwork and secondly for security and insurance, he did not want public records of his acquisitions.    So, Rene's supernatural revelation and miraculous, instantaneous worldwide auction report is nothing but nonsense and Hollywood fantasy which also is this film's foundation. If nonsense and fantasy are your desire then this will fulfill.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|This retelling of Pride and Prejudice takes us where no other Austen adaptation has gone before. Modern London singleton Amanda Price has been dreaming of Mr. Darcy her whole life and when Elizabeth Bennet shows up in Amanda's bathroom wanting to switch places, Amanda is ready to accept. However, once inside the story, things don't go exactly as Jane Austen planned! The results of Amanda's interference are both funny and heartbreaking. . I don't think this show is meant to be taken seriously as a period piece. It seems to be more tongue in cheek with many inside jokes for lovers of all things Jane Austen. If you try to take this as a direct adaptation or a strict period piece you will be disapointed. I'm a Janeite and a huge fan of the novel and the Colin Firth version and I really enjoyed this production. I think even Jane Austen, if she lived today, would be laughing along
1905654294|2.0|When I read Twilight a couple years ago, I became obsessed with this series - not a very unusual thing to happen, obviously. I absolutely loved it and I went insane waiting for the next books to come out. It didn't help that I also got one of my friends into it, and her obsession added to mine. I was almost in tears when Breaking Dawn came out, knowing the series was over.    Those tears soon turned to laughter as I read this book - and not a good laughter. I can't believe how disappointing it was. I admit that I have read a few Twilight fanfictions, and while reading Breaking Dawn I honestly felt like Stephenie Meyer just took every cliche she could find from those other stories and shoved them in her book. Everyone was so out of character, the whole plot was ridiculous (hence, my laughter during even the most serious parts), and the writing style that I loved so much seriously deteriorated. Maybe there was no good way to end this series, I don't know; but this was just terrible. I can't even get into the details that upset me too much, I know I could go on for ages. Twilight is still my favorite book, and I'm very grateful to Stephenie Meyer for introducing me into this world, but if you want my honest opinion, stop once you finish Eclipse. The ending to the series is not worth it. If you absolutely need some closure, read the first 3 chapters of Breaking Dawn, MAYBE the very end if you're desperate, and stop there. No need to ruin the story for yourself.
031606792X|5.0|I'm a 30 something female who started out reading the series so I would feel comfortable about letting my tween daughters read it. Now, I've totally became addicted to them and can't wait for more.    I believe that the book started out as you would expect. Then as you get into it suprises you weather good or bad. It was negative for me. I put it down angry for  a few hours, I couldn't stand it any longer. Then read until I fell asleep. I believe this is the best book in the series. I also believe theirs so many mixed reviews because people didn't get their way. Its wonderful that books can bring out so many emotions and so varied. I would tell Stephenie Meyer that she is brillant and that our entire middle school girls love her series. Its wonderful when girls that don't like to read can't stop. I would love to see tons more books in this series.

B001NLKWLW|5.0|I enjoyed the mystery of this book and the characters. It kept me comming back until completed.
B0015DYIH2|2.0|When wriiting this conclusion to a decent series, author Stephenie Meyers forgot the basic rules of fantasy power.    1. No character can be all powerful. There has to be limits to every characters power.  Bella is all-powerful: She has no \\"bloodlust\\", there is effectively no limit to her shield.  She single-handedly won a battle with the supposedly powerful Volturi.  And really, her 'shield' was stolen directly from Star Wars.    2. Sacrifice means you have to give up something important in order to have what you want. In this series, someone needed to die, and that was Jacob.  Now, Jacob was my favorite character and I hate Edward. However, for the plot to work, and the threats of violence to hold - not to mention the little suspense there was - people had to die, and Jacob needed to be one of them.  In addition, Charlie needed to die at Bella's hands in order for there to be SOME terrible outcome of vampirism.    3. It made absolutely no sense for there to be no detriment to Bella becoming a vampire.  There is never an explanation for how she can avoid the terrifying transiton and supposed first year of constant thirst.  She just goes through 2 days of pain and bada boom she's the perfect superhuman. The only decent chapter was when she lost a small bit of control on her first 'hunting trip' and went after the humans.    4. The half vampire baby was a prop, and a poorly used one.  I think her introduction was an effort by the author to avoid writing about Bella as an actual vampire, because as soon as the baby is born the book transitions into Nessie's Story.  And poor Jacob, who was sick at Quil's imprinting on a toddler, has to be imprinted on a newborn?  He goes from proud wolf-man to wolf-mount.  Besides, half-vampires are not a new concept...and Blood Rayne isn't the only one out there.    5. Could there be a more contrived ending?  Throughout all of Aro's stalling your could almost hear the author's anxious worry that her drawn out stand-off might heaven forbid turn into a battle.  The loss of Irina is inconsequential and has absolutely no impact on the story.  Truely, the finale by rights should have been Bella's losing control in the so-called bloodlust chapter, forgetting the possiblity of her shield expanding out from her, and launching herself at the enemy. Super-Newborn anyone?    6. Lastly, the sex-scene that never happened. I don't read books for this, but really, use a little more grace if you have to add it in.  We're not looking for anything graphic like Jean Auel, but come one, fade out fade in to destroyed pillows etc? Who is so in love they would miss that? And really, I thought more of Bella than to suddenly turn from proud virgin to begging teenager.    All in all, this book was a terrible conclusion to a half-way decent series.  JK Rowling wasn't afraid to have terrible things happen to beloved characters. The sacrifice gives us a reason to stay in love with them.    Well, on a bright note, at least the story is over.  Or is it?
B000M341QE|5.0|I've seen the film only once, which is not quite enough to catch some crucial details about the father at the beginning.  But the film is essentially a frantic gangster send-up like \\"Goodfellas\\" plus Hamlet with a theological twist: it's the search for identity and for the father, which are essentially the same thing.  It's also a film in which DiCaprio is no longer seen as a mere teenager or, recalling Spielberg's leaden caper film, where Sheen is more caricature than believable character.<br /><br />There's a scene in the film between DiCaprio and Nicholson during which I was conscious for the first time that the former could hold his own--as a mature, believable, adult actor--and with the very best of them.  And what a crucial scene that turns out to be.  In this modern-day \\"Hamlet\\" tale about a young man's desperate search for identity, he gains it--threefold--and just at the moment we're convinced he's lost everything.  In the film's last incredibly tense, headspinning moments, we learn that 1. DiCaprio rather than Matt Damon is the trusted \\"son\\" of the mafia father figure played by Nicholson (Damon's character rejects outright the sentimental notion of being a \\"son\\" to Nicholson); 2. we are assured that DiCapio's identity is not lost when Mark Wahlberg's character, as a surrogate for Martin Sheen's character which, in turn, is a surrogate father to DiCaprio's, shows up to dispose of the imposter; 3.finally, the deal is triply \\"clinched\\" at our realization that the father of the baby being borne by Madolyn is not Damon's but DiCaprio's.<br /><br />The line from \\"Hamlet\\" that's recited is \\"Readiness is all.\\"  But life, Scorsese, seems to be saying, is far more unpredictable and ludicrous, far more messy than this: none of us is ever ready (Nicholson's line to the effect that \\"we're all dying\\" suggests as much), and DiCaprio's character seems the least ready of all.  Yet in the midst of all the violence and bloodshed, and despite all the lunacy and confusion, justice and clarity win out after all.  This is, in many respects, the film befitting a mature, or \\"senior,\\" director, who is moreover a man of faith.  Unlike Coppola's fascination with the \\"humanness\\" of mafia families, Scorsese seems more interested in the \\"humanity\\" of these unsaintly, fallen prodigals who come to symbolize us all: they represent the universal human condition in all its absurdity and hope for redemption.  For Scorsese they, no less than all of us, must not be consigned outright to the circle of the eternally damned.  Even in their twisted, misguided, and confused relations, fathers and sons manage to find one another, mothers produce the sons by the fathers they truly love, the identity that is at once so elusive and questionable emerges after all--there's no question about its being a human identity and there's even a possibility that it retains much that is holy, emanating from a supreme father who ultimately pilots this ship of violent fools to a peaceful end.win out after all.

0553582038|5.0|Remember how Robert Jordan went from writing exciting books for the first 3-5 books of The Wheel of Time series? Then it was aimless, and boring, and each page was filled with a hundred names you couldn't remember and didn't need to as it turned out? This book has the feel of Jordan's plummet into irrelevance, including too many names of nobody characters and no action whatsoever. However, it is a great book when compared to what else is out there. Martin is the man now. Only Patrick Rothfuss and his \\"The Name of the Wind\\" are even close. So this gets 5 stars anyway.

B00004ZAV3|3.0|In 2000, The Beatles released '1,' a single-disc, 27-track compilation spanning The Beatles' entire career, 1962 to 1970. Released on Apple in 2000, the record was digitally remastered, and before I begin my review, the sound quality on this disc is exceptional. It really is. Now, read on for my review for '1.'    While each of these 27 songs are five stars easily, I don't really recommend this disc for anybody except for the new, casual or hardcore Beatles fan. Why, you may ask?     First off, while everything here is superb, two of their finest albums go completely unrepresented. 'Rubber Soul' and 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' are easily two of the finest records EVER MADE, and yet, there is NOTHING on this album from those albums. No 'Michelle,' no 'In My Life,' no 'Drive My Car,' 'Norwegian Wood,' 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.' I could go on and on and on.     Also, nothing from one of their early albums, 'With the Beatles.' That means, no 'All My Loving' or 'You Really Got A Hold On Me.' These are also disappointing omissions.    The point is, it's virtually impossible to gather all of The Beatles' best songs on one disc. It has been attempted many times, including on '1.' Now this is a good disc, I own it, and I have listened to it many times. It's got many of the basics, on a positive note. Spanning 'Love Me Do,' from 1962, to 'Let It Be' and 'The Long and Winding Road,' from 1970, this disc does cover every phase of the group's career. But, the omission of songs from 'Rubber Soul' and 'Sgt. Pepper's' prevents this disc from getting five stars.    Any Beatles compilation lacking tracks from those two albums is three stars at best.     Overall, I strongly recommend '1' to the casual Beatles fan, the new Beatles fan, and for the hardcore fan just because of the slamming sound quality. But otherwise, I recommend '1962-1966' and '1967-1970,' both two disc sets, to get The Beatles best work. There, you will collect many of their great songs that are missing in action here. Get those instead.    '1,' unfortunately, can be skipped.
0385341008|5.0|My first exposure to this delightful work of fiction was listening to the audio version on Random House CD.  When I finished it I felt like I had personally been with Juliet, Dawsey, Isola, Sydney and company.  That I had actually been a visitor to the Isle of Guernsey.  I wanted to buy the book, so I could see the words spoken by these characters for myself.  I plan on purchasing the CD version as well so I can go to Guernsey whenever my spirit needs a lift.  This is one of my top 10 reads of all time.  I was not aware that the German Forces had managed to occupy an area so close to the British Isles and \\"Guernsey\\" magnified my understanding of the British experience during World War II .
B00004T9UF|5.0|Many love Eminem.  Some think he's a genius, a true artist, and one of the greatest rappers ever.  Others think he's just a poser who is misogynistic, homophobic, and vulgar.  Listening to this album makes me fall into the former category, and I'm proud to be there.  I think Eminem is a real artist, and a damn good one.  This is one of his best albums, and whenever I play it, it still has the powerful impact of when I heard it first.  Unlike a lot of rap albums which date once the shock value is over, The Marshall Mathers LP stands tall.<br /><br />This album has some of Eminem's greatest songs.  The darkly hilarious Kill You is a great starter for the album.  The song Stan is a great song, with a fantastic backing track by Dido, and Eminem's lyrics really tell the story well of an obsessed fan and how hard it is for him to deal with it.  It's a powerful and sad song, and Eminem's performance is brilliant.  The song Who Knew is wonderful and filled with dark humour.  The line about the late Sonny Bono still makes me laugh (sorry, Sonny).  My favorite track, though, has to be The Way I Am.  Starting with a scratchy backing track and a wickedly intense piano bit (by Tom Coster, Jr.), Eminem rips into everyone and himself about fame, fortune, the garbage of just dealing with life with a performance that is as intense as it is breathless.  It's one of his greatest songs ever, and I still get chills whenever I listen to it.  The song The Real Slim Shady is a lot of fun.  Kim is another harrowing song, one that shows Eminem isn't afraid of showing the pain and agony of his first marriage (now divorced).  It's one of the most difficult songs on the album, and I have a hard time listening to it at times, because it's filled with so much raw pain and agony.  It's pure emotion, and it's ugly, like pure emotions can be.  But it's undeniably something you remember, whether you like it or not.<br /><br />Many self appointed moral guardians (of both political stripes) love to take Eminem's lyrics out of context to show that he's the main cause of all the problems in America, and if we just ban him, everything will be fine.  Well, that's never worked at any time in our nation's, or any nation's, history.  Eminem has his pulse on something, but he doesn't know what it is.  He just feels it, and he goes with it.  The man is one of the best rappers ever, not a flash in the pan, but a real artist who will stand the test of time.  The Marshall Mathers LP is one of his finest achievements, and I'm hoping for more great achievements from this great man.yrics out of context to show that he's the main cause of all the problems in America, and if we just ban him, everything will be fine.

B0000X61VE|3.0|I don't really recommend this video to people who are not familiar with safety. It is OLD SCHOOL form as one reviewer has mentioned. I will however say that if you know where to engage, and use total core control, it can be fun and beneficial. Radu and Cindy do not give enough cues on safety and muscular engagement. If you know how to take care of yourself by not pushing and relying on momentum, then take it for what it is---a creative workout (I have seen far dangerous dvd's in today's market). I'd like to see someone come out with a dvd that has Shape Your Body's cinematography and creativity with more emphasis on safety and controlled movements.

All the necessary   ingriedients are available in most American markets and this leads you into wanting to experiment. If this is not   enough as written, you receive a bonus, a visual DVD, showing you how to develop the skill and preentation is then up to you.  A must for any cook to have in her library of  books.

Jokes aside, the energy, love, talent, vibration and joy exuded by this group is simply inspiring. I recently went to their concert in Houston and it truly amazes me how they give it their all. When these people get together, they produce magic.    I believe no other reviewer has spoiled the surprise at the end. just be sure to watch this uninterrupted and with a GOOD stereo (or home theater) system.    don't think, just get the DVD. now.

0385340575|4.0|After last year's debacle in \\"Nothing To Lose\\" author Child brings us classic Reacher in this year's \\"Gone Tomorrow\\".<br /><br />I have to believe that he and his publisher must have paid some attention to all the bad reviews, including all those right here on Amazon.<br /><br />This time around, Reacher mistakenly believes a fellow passenger on the New York subway may be a terrorist preparing to commit a violent act, and when he approaches her she commits suicide instead.<br /><br />As Reacher tries to determine why, in an effort to redeem himself in his own eyes for making such a blunder, he has to wade through barriers created by the NYPD, as well as \\"unnamed\\" Federal agencies. In true Reacher style he bulldozes his way through to the kind of slam-bang action-filled climax that satisfies on all levels.<br /><br />Peopled with unique and interesting characters, truly evil villains, and fully-realized settings, this novel delivers.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|On the one hand, when a studio bankrolls a remake or a 'reboot' in this case, I feel the need to lament the lack of creativity, the lack of original thought at work in the Hollywood studio system. Can't anyone come up with anything new and original? But when the 'reboot' is as good as \\"Star Trek\\", I kind of wish J.J. Abrams was at the helm of them all. His new film adds richness and depth to a once ailing mythology bringing it back to life by going back to the beginning.<br /><br />\\"Star Trek\\" introduces us to Kirk (Chris Pine, \\"Bottle Shock\\"), Spock (Zachary Quinto, TV's \\"Heroes\\"), Bones (Karl Urban), McCoy (Simon Pegg, \\"Shaun of the Dead\\", \\"Hot Fuzz\\", \\"Run, Fatboy, Run\\"), Sulu (John Cho, \\"Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle\\"), Chekhov (Anton Yelchin, \\"Alpha Dog\\") and Uhuru (Zoe Saldana, \\"Drumline) on the first voyage of the U.S.S. Enterprise. As this is \\"Star Trek: Origins\\", if you will, writers Robert Orci and Alex Kurtzmann (\\"Transformers\\", \\"Cloverfield\\") and director J.J. Abrams (TV's \\"Lost\\" and \\"Alias\\", \\"Mission Impossible III\\", \\"Cloverfield\\") have taken some liberties with the timeline and stayed true to other parts of the mythology. What this mix accomplishes is to give us a fresh take on these characters, allowing us to see how they got started and how they would become what they would become.<br /><br />A rebellious kid, Jim Kirk (Pine) likes to race vehicles he doesn't own in his Iowa hometown. One day, he enters a bar filled with Starfleet Cadets and starts hitting on a beautiful woman. But Uhuru (Saldana) isn't interested and asks him to leave. A fight quickly develops and Kirk gets a bloody nose before Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood) puts and end to the bar brawl. He sits Kirk down and explains he knows about him, about his father and challenges Kirk to join Starfleet and do better than his dad did. His dad died trying to save as many lives as possible when the U.S.S. Kelvin was under attack. The next morning, Kirk takes up the challenge and meets McCoy (Urban) a doctor who is also headed to Starfleet for training. Three years later, Kirk is taking the infamous Kobayashi Morou test again. And passes. Much to the astonishment of the test's creator, Commander Spock (Quinto), causing the two to become, at best, rivals. Just as an academic tribunal is called to investigate the charges against Kirk, Starfleet receives a distress signal from Vulcan. They quickly dispatch the recruits to new ships and eventually, everyone ends up on the Enterprise under Captain Pike's leadership. As they head out to assist the other star ships, Kirk becomes convinced they are about to enter an ambush and proves to be right. A Romulan mining vessel, led by Nero (Eric Bana, \\"Hulk\\", the upcoming \\"Funny People\\") is drilling into the core of Vulcan, causing seismic activity and he has just blown up the rest of the ships. The Enterprise takes evasive action, but Pike is soon summoned to the enemy vessel leaving Commander Spock in charge. He appoints Kirk his First Officer. The first order of business is to stop the drill and then save the Captain. But Nero proves a persistent villain and when he reveals what he really wants, everyone kicks into overdrive and start working together, becoming the team we all remember. Will Kirk and Spock learn to work together? Will everyone find their place on the Enterprise? Will this vessel staffed largely by new recruits be able to fight off the bent-on-revenge Nero?<br /><br />Abrams has achieved the right balance of reverence to the characters and universe of these people while taking them to new and exciting places, bringing them alive for a new generation. It's really quite remarkable work when you think about all of the other needless remakes and reboots littering the Hollywood landscape.<br /><br />All of the characters seem to have the trademark mannerisms of the television cast. Pine develops a telling swagger and bravado, very similar to William Shatner's portrayal of the role. More importantly, hedoesn't display these mannerisms from the beginning; he grows into them as he develops the courage and bravery he will become known for. A friend saw a copy of Entertainment Weekly with Quinto as Spock on the cover sitting on my desk. \\"How do you feel about them using a CGI character in this film?\\" After a brief conversation, I learned he felt the character had to be CGI because he looked so similar to Leonard Nimoy's Spock, only a lot younger. I explained that an actor was playing the role and he was just amazed. Quinto was, reportedly, the first person hired for the film and he does an excellent job of making the character his own, while paying homage to Nimoy. Karl Urban seems to have a lot of fun paying the perpetually cross Dr. Bones McCoy, again adopting and paying homage to many of the character quirks DeForest Kelly used in his portrayal. Zoe Saldana is good as Uhuru. She and Kirk meet in the bar the night before they leave to join Starfleet and he continues to pine for her throughout the film. Her Uhuru is a little more fully integrated into the plot, a little more active, involving herself with Kirk and Spock. Anton Yelchin has some fun moments as the very young Chekhov. And John Cho. Well known for silly, raunchy comedies shows he may have some action chops on him. Sulu is also new to the Enterprise and has some growing pains. When Captain Pine picks Kirk and Sulu to lead a mission to stop a Romulan drilling device, they team up on a pretty terrifying and thrilling mission. And Sulu's unique skill set quickly comes in to play.<br /><br />And that, is your crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise. Wait! Who am I forgetting? Ah yes, Scotty. Scotty is played by Simon Pegg, a British comedian who stars in a series of memorable films he co-wrote and co-directed (the best is \\"Shaun of the Dead\\") and he is clearly having a lot of fun playing the role. At one point, he shouts James Doohan's trademark phrase \\"I'm giving her all she's got\\" and it's nice to hear it even if it seems drowned out by the cacophony surrounding their battle. It is also interesting to see how Scotty joins the crew as he isn't on the ship when it leaves Starfleet.<br /><br />Bruce Greenwood plays Captain Pine, the original commander of the new U.S.S. Enterprise. He does a good job displaying the right mixture of knowledge, leadership and mentoring to his young crew. More importantly, this is Abrams way of giving a little wink and a nod to the fact the original television series pilot was filmed with Captain Pine, not Kirk. The network didn't like it and Gene Rodenberry recast the role making William Shatner Captain Kirk. This pilot episode would eventually become the basis for a later two-part episode reusing much of the footage in flashback. An interesting move on both Rodenberry and Abrams' part.<br /><br />Eric Bana plays Nero, once a simple miner trying to make a life for he and his expectant wife, who is now so hell-bent on revenge, he will destroy entire planets to achieve his goal. He is good, surprisingly, and displays both the right level of menace and humanity as displayed through his reasons for wanting to extract revenge. Bana was once the next big thing and starred in a series of films, none of which ever achieved much critical praise or box office clout. He is more interesting as the villain in this film than he was as the \\"Hulk\\" in the version directed by Ang Lee. He is following this film with a role in \\"Funny People\\", the new film from Judd Apatow starring Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen, Leslie Mann and Jonah Hill.<br /><br />And I don't think I'm spoiling anything for anyone by mentioning that Leonard Nimoy makes an appearance as Spock. It is sort of thrilling to see him return to such an iconic role. Better yet, rather than a quick cameo, his appearance plays an integral role in the plot and he has a significant amount of screen time.<br /><br />Perhaps best of all, none of the characters goes without creating at least one moment of levity. It is nice to see that while the material is taken very seriously, they also recognize we can have a bit of humor, to lighten up the serious nature of the story. Just a little.<br /><br />Abrams has created a plot involving black holes, time travel (allowing him to include Nimoy) and revenge. It is an involving, complicated story that makes good use of the characters, their mythology and their backgrounds. It's a great ride and an almost perfect film.<br /><br />I read an article about the making of this film and Abrams noted that when he was researching the material and watching the episodes of the television series, he noticed a lot of scenes had lens flares in front of the character's faces. This is yet another aspect Abrams chose to pay tribute to. And it is an interesting visual device the first dozen times or so. But when this continues throughout the entire film, sometimes more than once in a scene, it becomes distracting and annoying. In almost every scene, a bright light or a lens flare partially obscures at least one character's face for a few seconds before disappearing or lowering to return again. A few times, this is used as a transitional device, but more often than not, it simply becomes distracting.<br /><br />Despite this one annoying (and constant) distraction, Abrams and his writing team have done an amazing job of bringing life back to familiar characters and a familiar mythology that we don't have to give up just yet. I can't wait to see what they come up with for the two sequels. Can Khan be far away?unding their battle.

Characters are so finely constructed that it's easy to imagine walking down the street and running into Clary or Magnus at a faery diner, or wandering through eastern Europe and being repelled by some imagined force.

B0026OR1UK|5.0|\\"Myelin wraps - it doesn't unwrap.\\"   Simple and amazing.  According to Dr Fields et al, at UCLA, it is a neuronal highway paved by using its firing circuits and synapses to mold pattern of our overall brain capacity and capabilities.      According to their analysis it is only one directional occurrence.  It only wraps, it does not unwrap.  Once your skill set is wrapped, you cannot un-insulate it unless your system is aging or it is diseased.      I am most interested in diseased part, especially during the developmental age, where manifestation of neurodegenerative process is less pronounced due to more robust re-paving capacity at younger age.    Therefore, our neurodegenerative studies and research should re-focus and pay attention to the most likely marker in Multiple Sclerosis of Gliotoxin, which is highly catatonic for astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.      In disease like Multiple Sclerosis, which attacks more women than men, it represents an initial pathogenic factor leading to the neuropath logical features of MS, such as blood-brain barrier breach through endothelial cells causing eventual demyelination.
B000002G26|2.0|I have been buying from amazon for 5 years. And I never received a CD that was so poorly packed. This seller must be 8 years old. And the CD case was broken and probably bought at The Dollat Tree. I will not ever buy from this seller again.
B000002KDO|5.0|The third album, Master of Reality, while not being Sabbath's best (behind Black Sabbath Vol. 4 and Black Sabbath) is still pretty much a perfect album.     The album is guitar driven except perhaps with the song Solitude, which is somewhat similar to Planet Caravan (it's not as good though). There are two good instrumentals on this album: Embryo and Orchid. My only complaint about those two is that they are too short. Into the Void and Children of the Grave (this song is not about dead children) are two of my favorites by Black Sabbath and have awesome riffs. After Forever is pretty cool too and is one of the most Christian songs I've ever heard. Sweet Leaf has a nice riff and decent vocals, but I feel like something is missing from it; it's the weakest track.    If you already have albums of the Ozzy era of Black Sabbath, then you should get this album. If you're new to Black Sabbath or haven't heard Black Sabbath as it sounded with Ozzy however, I recommend you to buy the album Black Sabbath Vol. 4.
1433502410|5.0|This is an excellent study bible.  The ESV translation is great, and I love all the study notes.  I had previously been using the Life Application study bible, which is good, but the study notes in it are geared toward application of the bible verse to life today (hence the name \\"Life Application\\").  The only problem I have found in this approach is that the notes don't always give a clear explanation of the verse (both from the original language and in context), but rather sometimes only gives a life application lesson from the verse.  I would rather know what the verse really means, and then through prayer ask the Lord to show me how this verse can be applied in my life.  Having a clear biblical understanding of the meaning of the verse is far better than skipping this step and just having someone explain their view of how this verse should be applied to my life.  With the ESV study bible, their notes are really good, along with many cross-references, maps, outlines, introductions, etc.  I enjoy this study bible more than the Life Application one, and I like the ESV translation a lot, too.

B001FB55HG|1.0|ok I'm a big fan of the Terminator series but I was not happy when I left the theater. I'll be fare in saying that it was well made & I could tell a lot of work went into the movie. But I just didn't like it. The beginning of the film really dragged; I could count on one hand how many actual terminator robots showed up to get the action going. Also, the diaglogue was really difficult to understand in the helecopter scene; I missed the whole conversation over the chopper sounds and the yelling. I can't believe I'm saying it, but the story would have been better if they'd cut out John Conner and just followed Kyle & the confused Android dude (whose name escapes me)- there was a lot to work with between these two characters they were interesting and the story should have just featured the two of them as the stars and then end the film the two characters meeting up with john conner at the end. All John did was walk around in his sewer house and talk on the radieo and be boring.Well he had a few fight scenes but those scenes could have been done by the other two actors.     skip this next part if you dont want a spoiler:  My favorite John Conner scene is when he goes on the radieo and tells the human resistance around the world to NOT attack Skynet for the sake of their future. Call me picky, but why the heck would these people listen to him. half of them dont believe he's the real prophet and NONE of them know that human prisoners are being held at skynet, so i found that scene...peculiar...\\"YES, LET US ALL NOT ATTACK SKYNET, OUR MOST HATED ENEMY AND STICK IT TO THE MEN IN CHARGE!FOR OUR...FUTURE?\\"     finally, the last thing i didnt like was the whole \\"Stick it to the Man\\" attitude Conner displayed. clearly it's hollywood military but i come from a miliatary family and know a few things one of which is that you do not argue with your superior, DUH! when will hollywood get that right?
0385341008|4.0|This is a charming summer read.  Interesting historical fiction. Delightful story. Set immediately after the end of the war.  Written in form of an exchange of letters between a writer from London and her friends, publisher and residents of a channel island occupied by the Germans during the war.  Sounds heavy, but reads as breezy, light and witty due to the personalities of the letter writers.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|This is a superb documentary about Philip Petit's wire walk between the twin towers of the World Trade Centre in 1974. The documentary is clevely constructed and makes the film as exciting as many thrillers.<br /><br />Contemparary interviews with the particpants adds enormously to the film, and the emotion that some of them still feel to this day is quite surprising and moving. The idea for the walk first formed in Petit's mind when he saw a newspaper article about the towers before they were built. Years passed before planning could start but eventually the detail fell into place.<br /><br />There is a lot of original footage in the documentary, as well as reconstructions and material from his earlier walks on the Sydney Harbour Bridge and others.<br /><br />Fabulous.

B000BUYP4Q|5.0|As a small child, Bruce Wayne witnesses the murder of his multi-millionaire father and mother in an alley. Thankfully before their death, they imbedded Bruce with good teachings to make him a good man when he grows up. Later on in life, as a young man, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) comes back to Gotham City seeking revenge on the man that killed his parents. When plans don't go accordingly, and also when he lets someone know what his intentions were, he realizes that his path for doing good for the city, isn't the correct path to do it in. So he leaves Gotham to escape and to find his way. And then a man by the name of Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) finds Bruce and tells him of a secret place that will teach him to fight for justice, but he must get there alone. When Bruce gets there, he begins his training in martial arts, ways of the ninja, and fighting what he fears most. After 7 years, Bruce finally returns to a Gotham City that is slowly falling into the bad guys hands. And Bruce takes it upon himself to help rid Gotham of the bad. To make them fear what he fears. To make them face Batman. As Batman begins to clean up the city, he finds out about a plan that will destroy Gotham City schemed up by Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy) and someone from his past. A toxin that will make everyone go crazy is about to be released in Gotham and Batman is the only one that can stop it.<br /><br />After some really bad Batman sequels (4 and 5 in particular), the franchise seemed to have been shot like a race horse with a broken leg. How could you ever come back from nipples on the bat suit? And then Christopher Nolan steps up and says \\"Hey yo, WB, I'm bout to hit you up the side of the head with a sweet Batman cause you know, I did Memento and Insomnia\\". Ok he didn't really say that, but he did promise them greatness, and greatness was delivered. While at first you think Batman starts off a little slow, you have to realize that we are delving into the persona of Batman himself. The reasons why he became the bat. The way he learned to fight the way he does. And to realize the biggest thing of all... that Batman is just a man. He has no super powers. He gets hurt just like the rest of us, except his been in some rigorous training to help ignore a lot of the pain. And it's great to see the two separate entities when it comes to Bruce and the Bats. Batman is the true man now, while Bruce is just the disguise that hides him. While Batman is fighting crime and avenging justice, Bruce is the cocky and fun playboy millionaire that no one would suspect is Batman. Christian Bale was great as both. I still think Michael Keaton is my favorite Bruce though because he just has a `coolness' about him, but Christian was definitely great also and is my favorite Batman, even with his kind of weird Batman voice.<br /><br />Christian Bale isn't the only awesomeness going on here in this movie either. Gary Oldman plays, perfectly, Detective Gordon. Even down to the look of him in the graphic novel `Batman: Year One'. Oldman usually plays bigger roles, but man I'm glad he played Gordon. Just perfect. And then you have Alfred, the butler/second father, played, well, once again, perfectly, by Michael Caine. Morgan Freeman is even here, playing Lucius Fox, a man that works in the `basement' of Wayne Tower inventing and making up some insane items for the military, that Batman eventually uses for himself. Think of `Q' for James Bond. Crooked smile Katie Holmes plays Bruce's best friend and love interest Rachel Dawes. She's also a woman that holds her own and tries to bring down the bad guys through the justice system. She's ok I guess.<br /><br />Some of the extras on the 2 disc were great. I knew Bale just got done making `The Machinist', and was Ethiopian like skinny for that movie, so I was amazed he got huge again for Batman in such a quick time. I mean it's hard for me to just lose 10 pounds. What I didn't know what that when Christopher Nolan told him to get as bigas he could, Bale did just that. He got fat. So fat that Chris was baffled and thought he'd never lose the weight in time. Some of the crew would tell Bale \\"What are we making again? Fatman?\\" So Bale had cut up the weight he regained. Crazy! Watching the scenes where he is learning to fight, you can tell he was still losing some weight, but he's still thick. They really didn't think the suit was going to fit him...hehe. Also the scene where Bruce and Henri Ducard are fighting on the frozen lake by the glacier was crazy. They had to rush that scene with almost no preparation. After they were done filming, the next day the lake became unfrozen and was a lake again. Talk about lucky. There was a lot of good stuff on those discs that will keep you busy for awhile. When you see what they did to make Gotham City, you'll be blown away. Talk about some work.<br /><br />Even though the movie does have some hokey scenes in it, such as the rooftop Batmobile scenes, it really doesn't hurt the movie at all for me. Great movie. Plain and simple. I thought nothing could beat it, but I was wrong when Dark Knight came out. So make sure you watch this first before Dark Knight...heh. Own it. Own it. Own it. And make sure you own it in HD-DVD or Blu-Ray.<br /><br />P.S. - Some of you know I'm reviewing my DVDs in order because it gives me something to do. How did I go from Be Cool to Batman!?!? Bad Matt...bad.<br /><br />P.P.S - I'm a top 1000 reviewer now! YAY!as he could, Bale did just that. He got fat. So fat that Chris was baffled and thought he'd never lose the weight in time.

0689865384|4.0|Could you imagine a society where everyone looks the same and no one is ugly?  In Tally's world, everyone gets to be pretty at the age of sixteen.  Or do they?  I thought this book had some thought provoking material and was an easy read.  The story was realistic even though there were some parts that seemed a little far fetched like the attack on the Specials in the end.  There are a couple of themes to the story as well. I felt the characters in the story were likable and easy to relate to.  They had ideas and feelings of teens today.  I would recommend this book to others and am looking forward to reading the next in the series, Pretties.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Other reviewers have complained about the unsubtle political undertones of the book, and not without cause.  Israel and Palestine solving their problem overnight, unsympathetic characters paying for things in 'Randbucks', and the plain implication that Bush, in fact, is to blame all make the author's politics very, yet unneccessarily, clear.    If you can roll your eyes at Cuba being the Earth's newest economic superpower, and Fidel embracing true democracy now that those troublesome sanctions have been lifted, and continue reading, there is some great writing here.  The author has obviously thought long and hard about zombies, as he covers everything you've thought of and dozens of things you haven't regarding a zombie war.  From infantry battle tactics when facing a 'chain hoard' of almost a million Z's, to the fate and action plan for dealing with the millions of infected in the worlds oceans, to the grand national and global strategizing needed for ultimate success.  Throughtout it all we meet interesting characters with emotional, often disturbing stories to tell about their wartime experience.     Take that as a warning: this may be a book about a fictional world war against the undead, but it takes itself very seriously.  These aren't uplifting tales about survival in adversity, but ambiguous, tragic stories that seem all too plausible among human beings thrust out of their comfortable lives and living for years in fear horrific death while witnessing unimaginable things all around them.  I0d recommend this to anyone who wanted to read some dark horror, but not if you are looking for some fun, light, theoretical reading on the zombie apocalypse everyone has thought about at some time in their lives.
B001V7YWTQ|3.0|No real reason to complain about the performances, but the song selection isn't very inspired. Interviews on the DVD say that the initial pool of songs was developed by each other; that is, Clapton listed the songs from Winwood's catalog, and vice versa. The pool was winnowed down, but I think the initial idea was weak. The songs Clapton plays lean too heavily on the blues, and Winwood's selections are just plain weak. Precious time is wasted playing the very repetitious \\"Glad,\\" for example, which could have gone to perhaps twenty better choices from Traffic. (I'd put \\"Shootout At The Fantasy Factory\\" and \\"Sometimes I Feel So Uninspired\\" high on that list. If Clapton really thinks of Winwood as a guitarist, as he says on the DVD, this would have given Winwood more of a chance to contribute. As it is, he's relegated to more of a singing sideman role, playing the organ.)    As for Clapton, I feel like we need another performance of \\"Ramblin'\\" as much as, say, Kinks fans need another recording of \\"Lola.\\" \\"Forever Man\\" was a fine, off-the-beaten path choice, but too few choices are like this.    I hope their sets on tour this summer are more interesting.

B0002F6AH0|4.0|This series is great for all the reasons mentioned elsewhere. A few things to note though    - mentioned elsewhere, but this collection focus heavily on the 'British experience', which may not interest everyone  - little mention of Mussolini and his rise to power  - could have used more mention of Soviet atrocities during the war (particularly the Baltic states)  - the bonus documentaries are very hit and miss, and mainly just expand upon what was in the original set (reusing footage and so on).  - could have used more detail about post World War II events, beyond the one episode that quickly covers the occupations of Germany and Japan, and the Nurmerburg trials. Could also lead into discussion of what started the Cold War  - could flesh out more about why the Soviet Union was allowed to remain the occupier of many countries for nearly half a century after the war, as well as remaining a dominating influence in Eastern Europe  - and more analysis of why the Allies chose to work in cooperation with Stalin, when they all knew about his murderous regime.    among other things that bear further analysis. In any case, this is a great set for anyone to get a full picture of World War II.

0316044695|5.0|Today is Memorial Day 2009 and it meant more to me than it ever has before. After reading Marcus Luttrell's book \\"Lone Survivor\\" I don't think I will ever feel quite the same about the war in Iran or any of  our wars... anywhere.  The Navy Seals should be proud of all they accomplish, even before they go to war.  I'm sure they are, but very few could make it thru training as Marcus & his friends did.I learned to appreciate all servicemen. I can't believe the pain the Green Berets, Navy Seals and Special Services go thru to achieve their goals..   Thank God for you all!!
B001PA0FFO|5.0|***This review contains PLOT SPOILERS, and is intended for those who either don't mind them, or who have already seen the film.  I tried to compose a review without PLOT SPOILERS but found that I could not adequately convey that which was haunting and praiseworthy about the film.  This fine film is built on a foundation of uncertainty, doubt, suspense and surprise.  If you haven't seen it yet, and want to enjoy it as much as I did, don't spoil the experience -- just go ahead and rent/buy it without reading further.***    I found this a magnificent film; it has haunted me fairly intensely since we saw it last night.  The performances are magnificent, as you would expect from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Meryl Streep.  The direction and pacing suited the storyline extremely well.  The film is intense and somewhat claustrophobic, with dire events playing out in a close community andwithin an enclosed space.  This accentuates both the isolation and the lack of privacy of Meryl Streep's character as she must confront an awful situation, largely alone.    As it develops, the film pulls you this way and that, leading you first toward one conclusion, then to another, back and forth until by the end the terrible truth cannot be denied, despite it having been a purely circumstantial case.  The film ends with the fulfillment of a great act of heroism, which is then quickly undermined, leaving the abiding faith of the protagonist deeply shaken.  Because the protagonist is at first so unlikable, it takes time for the viewer to appreciate her virtues and ultimately her heroism, which renders the film's faith-shaking denouement all the more tragically felt.    I tend to rebel against most film clichés, but one that I am known to eat up -- and did again in this film -- is the counterpoise of an unlikable protagonist and a seductive villain.  In this film, the hero is indeed deeply flawed, and while the actions of the villain are unforgivable, he is also possessed of some good intentions, or at least has convinced himself that he is.    The premise of the film is that two nuns suspect a priest in their church/school of being a child molester.  They - and the viewer - have nothing concrete to go on, only circumstantial evidence and intuition.  One of them is grabs the first opportunity to believe \\"proof\\" that her suspicions are ill-founded, whereas the other continues to believe in his guilt, and pursues him relentlessly and fearlessly until that guilt is implicitly admitted.      The film toys with the viewer a great deal, dropping suggestions of guilt, then quickly supplying exculpatory explanations.  How the viewer reacts to all this may be influenced by knowledge of the breadth of this problem as it is now known to have existed in the American Catholic church over this time period.  With this in mind, the viewer may be predisposed to see guilt in every circumstantial clue.  But I was influenced by other things as well - including the film Capturing the Friedmans, in which a family was basically railroaded on trumped-up charges of child molestation.  Awareness of these conflicting potential story directions makes the viewer feel guilty, and cynical, for seeing depravity in what might actually be pure acts of kindness.  One scene in which Hoffman hugs the student, who has just had his books spilled, could have been a model of Christian comfort were it not for the viewer's eyes probing for every evidence of impropriety.  Absent hard proof of anything, it comes down to what we each read into what little we do see, and we feel the uneasy basis on which to make a judgment.    If there's one Hollywood cliché that really bugs me, it's the stereotype of the hypocritical sanctimonious religious blowhard, pointing the finger of accusation at everyone else while engaging in private indiscretions or even crimes.  Hollywood has beaten that one to death, and I found this film refreshing in its alternative portrayal.  Here the ramrod-straight religious conservative is actually the sincere, idealistic one, whereas the one who seems superficially more reasonable, pluralistic and tolerant who is actually up to no good.  Philip Seymour Hoffman's character is the one who thinks it's perfectly fine if Frosty the Snowman appears in the Christmas pageant, or if students have access to ballpoint pens, in contrast with Meryl Streep's uncompromisingly rigid ways. It's his comforting demeanor that causes Amy Adams's character to drop her suspicions, and even to turn on Meryl Streep for her intolerance, which proved later to be exactly the wrong call.    Interestingly, people are at their least convincing in this film when they are making their own cases in oral conversation.  I was convinced of Phillip Hoffman's character's innocence until his conversation with Amy Adams in which he sounded like a creepy NAMBLA spokesman, trying to redefine \\"love\\" to suit a private twisted purpose.  And again, later in the film, even when no one has caught him doing anything, he destroys his credibility by the way that he tries to constrain Meryl Streep's avenues for checking on his past behavior.  Nor does Meryl Streep do herself many favors by the way she presents herself early; she leads the viewer to deem her a heartless tyrant before later revealing her inner compassion through action.  But each builds a more positive case for themselves with actions in other scenes - or at least, so it seems.    The film is morally complex in that it shows a series of suppositions and intuitions leading to the accusation of a terrible crime, all in the absence of clear evidence.  The easiest type of film to make would be one in which it was all a big misunderstanding, and the lesson is not to jump to rash conclusions.  But in this case, the suppositions turn out to be right, raising the far more complex case of how to morally conduct oneself when one lacks clear information and the consequences of being wrong are terrible.   No jury could have convicted Hoffman's character on such flimsy evidence, but Streep's character lacked the luxury of legal certainty in moving to protect a child.    The final confrontation between Hoffman and Streep is a powerful moment, in which Streep's character, a woman who has devoted her life to unquestioning service of the church, declares her loyalty to a higher moral sense - she in effect declares that she will do what she believes is right, to protect a child, regardless of how the church judges her and indeed regardless of how God judges her. She doesn't put it as directly as this in the film, but more artfully, and the effect is more moving than I am relaying here.    In the final scene, when Streep's character expresses deep doubt while clutching her cross, she doesn't say what she doubts:  Hoffman's guilt?  Her own actions?  The actions of a church that basically just kicked him a level upstairs, free to prey?  Her own fundamental religious faith?  Whichever she means, she has plenty to doubt at that moment - her certainty of her moral rectitude has given way to a dumbfounding confusion in which her church and faith have failed to uphold the most fundamental principles of a moral society.     It's so easy to imagine a lesser film being made from this material - how easy it would have been to craft a ham-fisted, preachy film, or one in which all religious people are portrayed as hypocrites, or a broadside attack on Catholicism, or any of a number of other lousy ideas.  Instead, Doubt is a riveting, emotionally buffeting, engrossing, moving film of great moral complexity and subtlety.
0205313426|5.0|A very clear, concise, and informative book.  It isn't written to teach grammar, but to fine-tune writing.  Strunk has a definite opinion on stylistic matters and he presents this throughout the work, using examples to illustrate his points.  White mentions in the preface that he tries to loyally adhere to this style.  Although there are things that one might disagree with, Strunk's advice is always worth remembering.<br /><br />For someone who doesn't have an excellent grasp on writing, this has been a valuable guide.  I expect that even the professional writer would benefit from incorporating Strunk's advice into his writing.<br /><br />Very worthwhile.
0307269752|5.0|For many years, my very favorite mystery has been Playing for the Ashes by Elizabeth George.  But after reading The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson, I now have a new favorite.  This book is not just well written, but the plot will haunt you.<br /><br />Mikael Blomkvist is a Swedish journalist and part owner of the financial magazine, Millennium.  Down on his luck, he receives a very lucrative offer from the rich and aging industrialist, Henrik Vanger.  Vanger wants to hire Blomkvist for an entire year.  First, he wants Blomkvist to write a book about the Vanger family.  Henrik believes his relatives to be \\"for the most part thieves, misers, bullies and incompetents.\\"  Henrik claims that \\"this story will make Shakespeare's tragedies read like light family entertainment.\\"  But the real reason for hiring Blomkvist is that Henrik wants the writer to revisit the disappearance and probable murder of his niece, Harriet, 36 years ago.  Henrik has conducted his own amateur investigation over the years and \\"Blomkvist wondered whether this was an unhealthy obsession or whether over the years, it had developed into an intellectual game.  What was clear was that the old patriarch had tackled the job with the systematic approach of an amateur archaeologist.\\"<br /><br />At first, Blomkvist believes there is nothing new to be discovered.  But little by little, new light is shed on old clues and a clearer picture emerges.  Blomkvist needs the services of a researcher/investigator, and so Lisbeth Salander is hired.  Salander (the girl with the dragon tattoo) is young, disturbed, anti-social, and perhaps suffers from Asperger's Syndrome.  But she is an incredibly talented investigator with a photographic memory and the ability to hack into computers.  The two make a good team.  The closer they get to unveiling the truth, the more their lives are at risk.  I carried this book around with me for several days until I was done--I just couldn't put it down.<br /><br />What makes this book even more fascinating are the circumstances surrounding the book and the author.  Stieg Larsson was a Swedish journalist who died in 2004 of a massive heart attack at the young age of 50.  He had three complete novels written but unpublished at the time of his death.  The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is the first of what has become known as the Millennium Trilogy.  Originally written in Swedish and published in 2005, the English translation was released in 2008--winning a number of posthumous awards for Larsson.  The second book, The Girl Who Played with Fire reunites Blomkvist and Salander and will be released in the United States on July 28, 2009.

Most work very well, Quiet Nights unfortunately fails. I was excited about her potential take on Brazilian and Latin flavor. The selections are all strong, however DK isn't able or doesn't want to do them justice. The monotone and overly heavy breathy renditions make it hard to get through each song let alone the entire disc. Typically you can find a gem or two, I think you would be hard pressed to find anything worth remembering or even playing twice. A big shame. Makes me wonder if DK is having legal issues with her label.

B001ANYDAO|2.0|Reading this book is like eating cotton candy. A pleasant and breezy read, yet in the end failing to impart much of anything substantive or nutritious.  This collection of stories or anecdotes is threaded by the collectivist theme of society's (i.e. government's) inordinate influence over the individual.  Gladwell is a good ol' New Yorker liberal, after all.  To be fair, Gladwell's bias is not tendentious and there were a few insights that I gleaned from the book.    It's up to you if you're willing to pay $10-15 for this cotton candy.  As for me, I'd rather spend the money on a juicy cut of New York steak.  Bloody, please.

B001VGFMBY|3.0|Most products can garner a four or five star rating with simple things. Music is different. I think these guys have infinite potential. This album wreaks of James Brown. There are obvious other influences but they are overpowered by the \\"good foot\\" vocals and horns that would make J.B. proud. It may also piss him off on some occassions. I agree with one of the previous statements that most great albums take you on a ride that changes sound and offers changes in rhythm, lyrics and tone. This one starts and ends the same way. Its feverish and very sophomoric but infectious and groovy at the same time. You will enjoy it and then become bored with the lack of versatility. Eventually you will play the four or five songs that personnify the album for you and keep the rest on the shelf.
B00169N0BK|5.0|I've been giving the ColorMunki a workout for several weeks and find that it is easy to use and my print colors have never been more accurate.  It replaces a first generation Pantone Colorvision Sypder I bought in 2002.  My desktop is year old quad core PC from HP running Windows Vista Ultimate, an Acer Ferarri 20-inch LCD monitor and photo printer is an Epson Stylus Photo 2200 printer.  I've seen a number of negative reviews here that leave me baffled, so I offer some advice.<br /><br />1) Before you install ColorMunki software, be sure to un-install and/or disable other color management software, like Adobe Gamma.  On Windows, I'd recommend using a good registry cleaner, like RegCure, to insure no color management applications are being loaded in the background.<br /><br />2) Check to make sure your graphics card software is set to the defaults.  Some games and photo editing software might \\"tweak\\" the color management settings.<br /><br />3) The ColorMunki \\"Easy\\" mode calibration requires a good, late model graphics card and software controllable graphics monitor.  For best results, use the \\"Adanced\\" mode and check both \\"Optimize brightness\\" and \\"Optimize Luminance\\" boxes.<br /><br />4) Don't calibrate you in monitor in \\"Advanced\\" mode a darkened room.  A fairly high level of ambient light is needed to set reasonable levels of brightness and luminance on your monitor.  This is likely the source of comments that brightnees on iMacs and other LCD monitors can't be turned down enough to make the ColorMunki happy.<br /><br />5) When creating paper profiles a) allow test prints to dry at least two hours before you scan them and b) make sure you scan the strips on top of a white card or stack of like paper.  My fist calibration of Epson Ultra Premium Presentation Matte paper was a little off because I scanned it directly on my blonde wood desk.<br /><br />6) Most laptop displays really cannot be calibrated adequately for critical color work because they use an integrated GPU with limited capability.  Results are going to be disappointing if the laptop does not have a dedicated GPU, like the ATI Mobility Radeon X800 or nVidia GeForce 9600M GT and fully adjustable display.  Only high end laptops meet this criteria, like the new MacBook Pro or HP Pavilion X16-1040.<br /><br />7) Take your time.

B001QB9H10|3.0|Happily ditching the cute kid, American setting and terribly fake CGI from Transporter 2, the third movie in the series is another bit of brainless car stunts and martial arts fun.<br /><br />Once again, Frank is shocked -- SHOCKED! -- to discover that the package he's delivering is a person, this time the sexy (but kind of annoying) Natalya Rudakova, who mostly seems to be an excuse for Jason Statham to take off his shirt.<br /><br />While it's nowhere near as good as the original, it's a big step up from the sequel and a good bit of action movie fluff. Definitely worth a rental for fans of the original.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Would really do the job if I would do it more than 3 days a week.  It's intense.
B0026GBIB6|2.0|Ive been a fan of DM since Speak and Spell and this has to be their 2nd worst album ever.  The bleeps and blurps all over the album seemed lazy and misplaced to me and there is sadly there is no synergy between sound design and the theme of song.  Also Martin Gore's chord progressions are advanced to the point of dischord and the modulations dont captivate me in the same way songs in the last 20 years did (I hope this isnt because Alan Wilder left!).  There are probably 3 well thought out songs on this album while the rest was a very large disappointment.  Sadly I feel like the band has finally become sloppy after all these years - earlier songs from chord arrangements, to sound design to the complex context in which they were delivered, were on a way higher lever and far more pleasing and captivating to me.  Im going to buy the latest Simple Minds CD and pretend this album never happened.  But its OK - Im spoilt as this band has delivered some of the best music I could have ever dreamed of in the last 20+ years.
B001TODCII|5.0|This is one intense, action packed, one and a half hours of movie. There is something that drew me in, and made me believe almost all of the amazing things that happened. The car chases were pretty spot on (going the wrong way down Les Quais de la Seine was a bit over the top); the gun fights; and the hand to hand fighting were incredible but not over the top. Liam Neeson, Bryan, is one lean mean Albanian killing machine.<br /><br />Bryan, former CIA agent, is divorced from his wife and she married a very rich man. Bryan quit his CIA job to live closer to his daughter Kim. Kim convinces him to allow her to travel to Paris with her friend Amanda. Bryan wants her to stay safe and gives her a cell phone to call each day. Kim falls for a con man at the Taxi stand, and they both end up kidnapped. During the kidnapping Kim is on the cell phone with her father all the way in California. The intensity of the story really starts here, the feeling of helplesness any normal human would feel is incredible. Instead, Bryan just swings into cold action.<br /><br />There is a moment at the airport where the film almost lost me. The two spoiled rotten very rich girls are standing at the Taxi stand in Paris. Peter, the con man, shows up and says Taxis are so expensive, would you like to share one? Under no circumstances can I imagine either of these spoiled brats thinking of saving money. If at that point Amanda had leaned over to Kim and said, hey he's hot, let's share the cab. No that didn't happen, and it just missed ringing true. A minor point, and the film doesn't suffer too much with that problem.<br /><br />Technically the film is pretty well done. Luc Besson co-wrote the script. Besson is a pretty amazing director in his own right, he really understands the whole thriller, edge of your seat film. The original French version of Nikita ([[ASIN:B00004XMSL La Femme Nikita]]), is very similar to this film, (Nikita is much darker). The film is skillfully directed by Pierre Morel, [[ASIN:B00008AOVL The Transporter]]. Pacing is excellent, just enough lead up and tension to each chase scene. The sound is remarkable, I felt more explosions in my seat from the subwoofer than I have in a long time. Fortunately the rumble is not over done.<br /><br />Oh and now for the rating. PG-13. Well, that's generous, better be sure your 13 year old is a bit mature. There is a very intense horrible torture scene about 3/4 of the way through, you may wish to fast forward. It is no worse than anything on 24 or on many television program. Just be forwarned, a 13 year old might just be a bit taken aback by this particular scene. Early in the film, we discover that Kim has been kidnapped by Albanians looking to traffic women from the Western Europe and the US. You also get to see prostitutes in Paris. There is no nudity, but be prepared that the average 13 year old might have some questions. There's very little foul language. Tons of violence, there's a quote by the French policeman at one point - 72 dead, 13 wounded, and a construction site destroyed. So you get the idea, lots of people shot and killed. The MPAA makes no logical sense whatsoever.<br /><br />It's an intense fast ride. It's violent. But there is something special about this film. And I did enjoy it very much.ansporter]].

B0002F6AH0|5.0|I have read heard and seen much about Hitler and the wars. But all I ever heard that he was a devil...and rightly so.    However this box set dawned a new light on events before the rise of Hitler that led to his rule and demise. And most importantly that he did not and could not do it alone. All the carnage, mayhem was hailed at first as an example of good strong government. In the guise of valiant community effort and sheer fright of the people.    Oh how we all love to be led like lamb to the slaughter, we will give up our basic human rights and freedom all for the mother land which ever; and where ever your mother land is.    After our 9/11 we could have embarked easily on this type of rule ...but the difference was that we are Americans, bred to think for ourselves.     This DVD is very powerfull and I recommend it to all who thought they knew all about Hitler,,,, He was one man but a whole nation and a whole following as well.    Brilliant.
B001BGTWXI|5.0|Not being a big Slipknot fan to begin with except for a couple songs like'the blister exists' I didn't expect too much out of this album either. Then I saw the video to Psychosocial and thought if the rest of this is as good as this song then the cd might be worth getting. So I bought the cd and in my personal opinion the whole thing is the best Slipknot has ever done. This is coming from a person that is a fan of death metal and listens to alot heavier and harder music than this. I just like this album period. I have it in my stereo at home and it gets played at least once a day. I don't care what direction some think Slipknot has taken and they might not like but I do like this cd and now hope Slipknot sticks around for more like it.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Why review this music when all the appropriate praise has already been offered? Because it is just that good. Because silence would be wrong.  Because those who have given it anything less than five stars need to be outnumbered. Perhaps even sought out and questioned: what were you listening to?  This is American music at its zenith. Simply presented. Pure emotion. Authentic. It is as good as it gets in this time, in this country.
B000I2J6K0|5.0|So... unlike most of the reviews I've read, I'm NOT an excercise enthusiast. But when I got pregnant, I started to feel like I was holding myself in the same position all the time - my body felt like it was getting older by the minute. (As if 37 wasn't old enough) I bought a yoga video, but couldn't take all the hippy-spiritual-\\"get in touch with your child\\" stuff. I just wanted to feel like a human being. I got this video and loved it.    I did it 1-2 times a week from arond the 4th month till the week I had my daughter. I found it reinvigorated my entire body, helped with circulation (read: cankle control), kept me balanced and made me feel spry overall.     The workout is fast-paced, but it's doable (even for me, the non-exerciser), and though I ended up modifying a few of the moves in the end, I found it easier and better than walking - even just one mile of walking was harder for me and worked fewer muscles.     THE KICKER: I truly believe that my labor and delivery was easier and quicker because of the exercises in this video. All the squatting and pelvic floor exercises came back big-time when it counted. Sorry if this is TMI, but I only pushed for 20 minutes. I felt like my body was strong and prepared for what it needed to do...    I WILL be recommending this to anyone I know who gets pregnant. And, shocker, I actually have the urge to keep exercising. Not sure what's happening to me...
0307269191|3.0|Like the author, I am both a novelist and a runner -- but he's far better at both than I will ever be. Murakami has run more than 30 marathons -- me just one. He's written numerous novels -- me just three (and two of those still to be published). So it was with great anticipation that I began this book.<br />I found it clearly written and engaging but disappointingly slight -- the kind of book an author writes to make a few extra bucks when he's become well-known and successful enough to sell just about anything on the strength of his past record and reputation.<br />There are a few nice observations about life and running and the connection between them and some mild philosophizing on encroaching old age and how to approach it. But in general, I had the sense that the author was as much hiding his true self as revealing it.<br />His description of writing his first novel is fairly typical. He's watching a baseball game (he gives the exact date) and it's the top of the second inning and someone gets a hit and at that precise moment, Murakami decides it would be fun to write a novel. A few months later, it's written; a few months after that, it's won a prize. Just like that, easy as pie.<br />Running is much the same. Occasionally there's some pain but mostly it comes easy, mile after mile after mile. He gives his muscles their marching orders and usually they obey. A couple of times, there are relative failures (in running but not in writing) and the legs seize up. But in general, no challenge is too great that it cannot be overcome.<br />As the book wore on, my general envy passed. One can't be jealous of Superman. At the end, I found myself regarding Murakami, not as a fellow runner and writer, but more of a phenomenon whose brain and body are constructed of different materials from mine.<br />And I found myself, while admiring him, also somehow disbelieving him.

B0013Y1GEQ|4.0|I first saw SHALL WE DANCE in its original incarnation, the Japanese version, and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was very culture-centric in its outlook, something that's missing from this remake, but it's very enjoyable nonetheless. I was hesitant to see this remake at first, since I was such a big fan of the original (even though I only saw it once), but this version won me over once I did see it. It captures the joy the main character found in dancing (something I myself will never know, unfortunately) and is a lot of fun to watch. Stanley Tucci and Richard Gere are excellent, as is Susan Sarandon, as usual. A worthwhile purchase and it has high multiple viewing value.      The Bluray image is good - it doesn't seem much was done in the way of re-processing for the release, but it does look very good.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|What an interesting way to tell a story.  I must admit I was skeptical about the story really coming together through just letters.  Shaffer and Barrows do a wonderful job.
B0000062FN|5.0|My best Santana Album with Abraxas and One of the best music albums in history, clearly.   This is a fantastic Disc, great songs, great players and a fantastic latin-rock fusion. Amazing.
B001U0HAYS|3.0|Film has very problematic picture and sound quality on Blu-Ray. It's a great 70s era \\"conspiracy\\" film, and very slow and talky in the Sydney Pollack way, that appears rather quaint and naive considering what we have learned about the way the world works since then.<br /><br />The source transfer for \\"3 Days of the Condor\\" has obviously not been re-done for Blu-Ray, and appears to be the same source transfer used for the much older DVD edition of this film. Although the superior medium and capabilities of a 1080p Blu-Ray disc make this an upgraded way to view this material, the limitations of an aging source transfer abound and call attention to themselves. Detail is good in well lit scenes, much less so on indirectly lit surfaces and shadows. Blacks are unstable, noisy and milky. Skin tone and texture show the waxy effect of DNR (digital noise reduction). Much of the \\"grain\\" appears to be tele-cine noise, much more than the actual grain in the original material. The sound is mediocre. All in all a better view than the DVD version. But only worth renting, or if it can be purchased used or on mark down at $10 or less. A fine film. But this Blu-Ray edition is certainly not worth $20.
B000002GJ7|4.0|`Extreme II: Pornograffitti' was very different from much of what its detractors referred to as the hair metal scene of the late `80's early `90's.  The band had power ballads but nothing like the formula of the day. The album's biggest hit \\"More Than Words\\" was basically a duet between Nuno and Gary while \\"Hole Hearted\\" was all acoustic and folksy.  The band could funk it up; witness \\"Get the Funk Out\\" (great bass line from Pat Badger) and \\"When I'm President\\". And for metal, `Porno' has several choice cuts including \\"Decadence Dance\\", \\"It's a Monster\\" and \\"Money\\".  In short, Extreme did a little bit of everything just as they had on their debut but their focus was more epic the second go around.  `Pornograffitti' made Boston's young guns a brief sensation in the metal scene. I remember a friend of mine raving about this band playing in clubs down in Providence and this odd little acoustic duet they would play that surprisingly wasn't on the debut LP.  He was convinced that \\"More Than Words\\" was going to be huge if it ever got released and he was right!  I don't like `II' better than `I', I think they are both extremely enjoyable and show a band with an embarrassment of riches showing off shamelessly. Sex does sell!
B0018CWEYY|5.0|It is VERY suspenseful and mysterious. One of the best seasons ever to come out of this television series.
0765317389|5.0|Amazing! Simply out of the ordinary! Card has taken his writing to a new level, with his use of simple elements from the Sci-Fi genre. The more you read the more attach you become to the novel. You are introduced to so much more than you ordinary Sci-Fi because Card has created a story that has let the mind wander freely in. From the contrast between characters and the imagery of battle rooms all sound so unrealistic but somehow Card can draw you back in to the story. The main plot in which, gifted children are isolated into military schools where they are trained to become the futures savior against the Buggers. Here you are truly introduced to the light and dark side of Ender through his epic simulations and interactions between his fellow classmates. It is not a surprised if you can connect yourself to Ender because the connection that Card uses between him and the reader is what really makes you so attached to the story. Ender being the highest ranked of the students is rising up among the highest military soldiers being the envy of students that he had excelled leading to the challenges that any ordinary person must face (fitting in). Through all of these challenges that Ender faces will he sink into the pressure and become what he is not or will he overcome his obstacles to become the best commanding officer on Earth to save mankind!?!? This is one ride that you just have to strap yourself into because it's a ride that you'll never get off. -jue
0061673730|5.0|I first read this book a lot of years ago. Every copy I bought seemed to end up being given to someone else. This version I have just read reminds of how life - changing the book is. This copy is for my son and i hope that he sees in it the values that I do.  The values in the book - once they are part of your life, they deliver Quality forever - which makes this about the best bargain ever!!
B001DDBCUU|4.0|People have often told me how [[ASIN:B0011UBDTK Sex and the City - The Complete Series (Collector's Giftset)]] was meant to be a \\"chick flick\\" show & I, as a male, had little business in watching it.  Well, chick flick or not, I LOVED the HBO series (so long as it was uncensored & not the TNT version).  So, it was only natural that I would be more than a little bit intrigued by the return of the ladies on the big screen / DVD.<br /><br />Carrie Bradshaw's wedding to Mr. Big is the centerpiece of the film.  While there were many times I thought of Mr. Big as Mr. Big JERK, it's still only fitting that he is \\"the one\\" whom Carrie is to marry.  From the earliest episodes of the series, Carrie's & Mr. Big's lives weaved in & out of each other.<br /><br />There are a host of subplots as Samantha and Miranda have their own issues to deal with.  Meanwhile, sweet Charlotte has her biggest wish come to fruition.  That's good to see, as Charlotte was always my favorite character on the show.<br /><br />One of the things that makes this movie so poignant is that we already KNOW all of the characters thoroughly.  We know about Carrie's flaws, and we love her anyway.  A great deal of \\"character development\\" is unnecessary as these are our friends from way-back-when.<br /><br /> There have been rumors that there might be a sequel in the works.  I am a little squeamish about that idea as I'm not sure where the story can \\"go\\" from here.  The original premise was about 4 single women in New York.  Well, 3 of them are now married off.  It seems to me that a sequel would degenerate into its being a \\"regular\\" run-of-the-mill soap opera, whereas SEX AND THE CITY was always so much more than that.  We'll see what happens.<br /><br />So, if you're  a fan of the show, then this DVD is a must-have.  If you were only curious about the show, then I would suggest you watch all the episodes 1st as it's important to have a clear picture of how important to see the backdrop of the stories which culminate in the movie's plot.  Welcome back girls!Welcome back girls!
B001IBIQU6|1.0|I LOVE Depeche Mode & Oh gosh, I listened to this album & already knew the 1st song \\"Wrong\\" which I like but the rest of the album is horrible!!! So disappointing, just not the Depeche Mode I remember.
B001UE276A|5.0|I've spent my whole childhood and teenage years listening to Depeche Mode. I knew all the lyrics by heart, I was collecting tapes with remixes and fake t-shirts with the Violator logo. We were all very poor and the music was the reason to gather and dream of seeing the world in their eyes...    By the way, I live in Romania.    The times are different now. But Depeche Mode kept that special place in my heart. Being now able to order an original box with DM books, discs and cards was like returning to a time when a song was more important than everything else. I returned back in time, to feelings that truly matter.     That's what this box did for me.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|It was a gift for my mother, she LOVES the show. I, myself, have only seen a few episodes, though it looks like a show I'd get into. I plan on borrowing it sometime to watch. :)

B001TH16DS|5.0|There is no question that this blu-ray set is thus far the best looking and best sounding home video release of the Original Series. The picture quality is superior to the original DVD release issued about ten years ago. And it is superior to the season sets issued a few years ago. The supplemental materials are superb as well. But in my opinion what steals the show is the viewers ability to watch either the original versions of the episodes or the enhanced versions with modern CGI effects. For the purists who insist that this is somehow an insult to the creators, I politely disagree. The improved effects only make the show shine even more brightly. Indeed, the set contains a documentary in which surviving creators of the show explain that the new effects are what they would have done had they had access to the technology. At $65 this collection is a steal. My only problem is what to do with my older season sets? Perhaps I'll donate them to a needy friend!
B0000DJZ8R|4.0|\\"The Grapes Of Wrath\\" is an interesting, beautifully-filmed, powerful movie, despite being marred by obvious political bias.    With the fabulous black-and-white contrasts here, I wish John Ford had directed a bunch of film noirs because this sure has the feel of one. This is just great photography and camera angles.     Henry Fonda is the lead character and does a fine job as usual but Jane Darwell steals the show as the matriarch of the family. John Carradine almost does the same with his ex-preacher role. The scenes of the family all piled on this old jalopy is one that will stay with you.

B000CNE092|5.0|While the cover of this DVD is one of the worst that I have ever seen, you may think that this is just another princess movies but the film inside I couldn't recomend more. The story is mostly fictonal and won't give you much history about the real story; but who needs history anyway...the story is about a girl near St. Pettersberg who is the only surviving child of the Russian Royal Family hooks up with two con men while the undead Rasputin seeks her death.    This movie is very Romantic and yet keeps the kid friendly vibe, everyone in the family will enjoy it.    What comes along with the dvd set is a 1-hour long movie which stars the bat in the main movie.     The set also includes commentary in the movies which is very interesting and is worth watching at least once maybe on the second time you watch the movie.    I own this dvd set and gave it 5/5 stars, the only thing that could possibly make it better is a better cover.

B001TODCII|2.0|The stars are for Liam Neeson and Maggie Grace, but not so much for the film.  It's a standard action/international thriller--nothing that has not been done a thousand times before.  Shooting an innocent woman in the arm to make her husband talk does not make me admire the so-called hero in the story, and neither does his leaving a man to be electrocuted repeatedly until the power eventually goes off.  Yes, I get that he is trying to rescue his daughter, but if it were so easy, there wouldn't be so many women still hidden away, as they are right now.  There's also no indication that he was going to notify the French police or Interpol about all the captive women he saw.  Sure, they could be moved, but at least there would have been some leads and perhaps DNA left behind.
B001PA65VC|3.0|After listening through this, I give it 3/5. I'm mostly a trance/house/club kind of person, so a lot of this was not my style. Omen was good, as was the reprise. Invaders Must Die is also a good one, but all the others have too much going on, and the audio isn't very clean, as if the music wasn't post produced, just released as it was recorded. I don't very much like that style. Ive listened to a lot of Prodigy in the past, and this isn't one of their best albums that they've made. Also I found several songs too repetitive and sounds like techno more than the punk/electronica that they usually produce. If you like techno, then this is the album for you.
B001RIY4WE|3.0|From what I've been able to see of it, this seems to be the best release of T2 to date, excellent video and audio quality.    But the disc keeps freezing on my PS3. I can only watch for 20 mins or so, and then it just locks up. I have to eject the disc, shut down the system, and then wait for several hours before my PS3 will even recognize it as a valid Blu-ray disc again. I think this might have something to do with the internet connectivity, and the next time I try, I'll make sure the internet is switched off completely.     And it isn't the disc, since I've already exchanged it for a new one, and it does the same exact thing.
0061438294|5.0|This book works on a number of levels.  First and foremost, it is ordered from the most honest parts of the body to the least honest, which really helps the flow of the book.  The pictures included with the body language examples are very helpful, and the anecdotes further reinforce the practical use of body language cues.  Navarro also reminds the reader of the importance of baselining and looking for clusters of signals; any one signal, especially out of context, provides little actionable knowledge.  I felt immediately prepared to field test the knowledge contained in the book, and based on that alone, I would say it hit the mark.  \\"The Definitive Body Language Book\\" (Pease & Pease) is more comprehensive, but a bit overwhelming; they complement each other well, but if you are going to read both, I highly recommend reading this title first.
B001FBSMF8|5.0|As a Chris Cornell fan from about 1989 it is very telling that I've very rarely been disappointed by this artist.    I was heartbroken when Soundgarden broke up and a bit wary of Audioslave... then I fell under the Cornell/Morello spell. Then there are his three solo albums. All have their positives and negatives. \\"Carry On\\" is Cornell's one album I really had to work a bit get into, but eventually did.    Then came \\"Scream\\". I have to admit, upon the first listen I was thinking, \\"What the hell IS this? He's gone down some funky, poppy, R&B road!\\" But man... once I got hooked by one song (Enemy) it wasn't long before I was hooked on all the rest. Plus, with the way the songs are designed to flow into eachother, I find it nearly impossible to just listen to one song at time.    This album, though a huge departure, is by far Cornell's most energetic, addictive and just plain enjoyable solo album to date. He is a true artist who obviously has no interest in rehashing what he's done before and brave enough take a risk on new genre... and, as one would only expect from him, DOMINATE it.    If you are purely a genre fan, no matter the performer, and you only tolerate the rock genre, then this album is probably not for you. But if you are a fan of an artist and trust a gifted one to create something special, then I highly recommend this album.
B001OQCVAG|2.0|A totally predictable retread of the jilted lover movies that seem to pop up every decade or so.  This is a silly, faux thriller that leaves no cliche uncovered.  I think the whole script was written for Beyonce to have her \\"you-go-girl\\" lines during the absurd girl fight sceen.  The screen play is at least under 120 minutes --well just barely.  That's the good news.  The real problem is the utterly atrotious acting.  Terrible doesn't describe Beyonce's acting ability.  She may be a great singer, but if she were on an acting version of American Idol she would be one of the first to get rejected, you know, in those first two weeks where we see all the hacks to laugh at. Idris Elba as Derek Charles is OK and only makes a few minor novice errors, but he could have been anyone.  I will commit no more words to this horrible flick other then to warn potential victims of move theater prices to save your money.  Rent if you must. Two stars only for the baby's fine acting.
B0009FU0ZQ|4.0|I usually like Tom Selleck but I had put off purchasing any of the Jesse Stone films until recently.  I bought Stone Cold as an experiment and was very pleased.  I like the character of Jesse Stone as a man with some issues to deal with but still a man with interest in and compassion for his fellow townspeople.  Tom Selleck portrays this man on the edge of burn-out very believably.  I like this first sampling enough to purchase the three other Jesse Stone offerings and to pre-order the one yet to be released.<br /><br />Jesse has moved from Los Angeles to a small East Coast town, looking for some peace.  However, it turns out, even small towns have murders.  Not only are all the characters, as well as Jesse Stone, portrayed well, but the plot is intriguing and keeps your attention right up to the climax of the mystery.

B001E7OO2I|4.0|If there's one thing John Legend will never be accused of, it's resting on his laurels. If you bought his second album expecting it to sound like his first, you were probably disappointed. Likewise, if you listen to this album expecting it to sound like either of his first two, you will probably be disappointed. While I don't feel he has produced his masterpiece yet, all of his work is good for various reasons. That includes this album. He's not afraid to experiment; try new things; explore different boundaries. It shows his versatility and is, in my opinion, what makes an artist an artist. His continuing Evolution makes me wonder what his next album will be like; maybe he'll call it \\"Shape-Shifter\\".
078322947X|5.0|This film is truly a hidden gem.  I want to say that they don't make films like this anymore, well they don't. Desperate men taking desperate chances in far away exotic lands (with Real Actors not beautiful people trying to act).  Totally awesome!  Next time you don't know what to watch, get this film.

B000002UAR|5.0|This was the Album when the Beatles stepped through the door into a totally new era of music history.  This was when they peaked at Rock and Roll and graduated into a totally new band rediscovering who they were and what they were about to become.  This is the one album that every Beatles fan should own because it distinctively displays their musical talents at this new level ever so smoothly woven into chords and count as songs bounce through your head.<br />The songs on the album are all classic and will live in Beatles history forever.  This is Revolver.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|Spsellbinding during first half and slows down a little in the second half.  Very entertaining.
B000005S5N|4.0|this cd kicks serious butt. the first 5 songs are the true keepers but the last songs still have a-ha quality. In my opinion, the one cd other than Hunting High and Low that is a must have.
B0017QDH3S|2.0|I love this 'theme'. This idea. The beginning was cool. Some effects were cool. I'm such a science fiction freak I will generally watch even pretty bad movies without complaint, just happy to have a little more of my genre make the big screen.    Yet... my 12 year old and I watched this. The plot... needed help so badly even she was scornful. It's one of those cases where the only reason the plot works at all is because the writers make all the characters uncommunicative morons, who get in situations solely because they're so stupid that you can't even feel sorry for them. We were too busy yelling at them to feel sorry for them.    Then there's the whole jumper-history and the lead's mother issue. Since the people pursuing the jumpers are not jumpers themselves, what are the odds that some one in a billion trait would show up in the kid of a hunter? Had they written it so they were all jumpers but on opposite sides, that might have had a chance.    To make matters worse, the one truly decent character in the show was apparently killed by the hero, or close enough (even that was not entirely clear), dashing the last ray of optimism we had for him or his worthiness. Before it was over we were genuinely hoping the hero would die a sudden and fiery death. Totally annoying.    But I love the whole concept this is based on. I feel like this COULD, potentially, have been an awesome movie. I would love to see more along these lines. It just doesn't seem like anybody with a brain was closely enough involved with it to have it come out less than embarrassing.    If your only interest is some cool effects in nice settings, have at it. It does have that, it's an \\"action movie\\" and I liked that part of it.     If you want even half a plot or halfway intelligent characters, though, this is probably not the show for you.
089381525X|4.0|Salgado is divine. He produces the most perfect images out there, in the documentary realm, and this book projects that well.  The images are spectacular, no other word than that.  Excellent printing of an amazing darkroom work.    Still, one series stands out above all - the Brazilian gold mine workers.  This is the only series where you can feel strong emotions and the judgmental eye of the photographer (and this is what I'm actually looking for in documentary photography. But it might be only me, though).  I assume the reason for that is Salgado's origin, but nevertheless, I really wanted all the series in the book to be emotional as this one.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|This DVD of Leonard's London concert last year is vintage Cohen, with old and new songs mixed together and a bit of humor thrown in here and there.  His musicians are masters, and so is he.  His voice is gravelly, but his three female backup singers smooth everything out.  If you love Leonard and his music, you will love this DVD.    His current US and Canada tour is the same playlist as the London concert.  The beauty of a DVD is that you are sitting in the front row and can see everything!  But don't miss the concert in person, if you can get there.  There is something about being live that can't be captured.  But if you can't go, the DVD will almost put you there.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|I purchased two DVD's with CD's of the Playing For Change video and music.  One was for my daughter who is an elementary music teacher, and one for myself.  The music is amazing, but I thoroughly enjoy the people from around the world who sing and play instruments on the video.  It is remarkable that someone could put everything together, it must have taken months, maybe years to accomplish.  5 stars isn't enough but it gets a top review from me!
B0001KL5DA|3.0|Six Feet Under is a contemporary soap opera that expands the boundaries beyond historical limits - a mortuary, gay men, possibly compulsive sex, etc.  The family is 'haunted' by their deceased father.  Believeable, not always.  Entertaining, yes.
B001TH16DI|5.0|The video quality of each of the movies is quite good and is indeed in high definition.  The colors were pretty good and the detail was excellent.  This is definitely not just an upscaled DVD-quality transfer -- the difference between these movies' video quality and that of an upscaled DVD version is pretty obvious.    There are a lot of extras on each of the discs although not all the extras were in HD.  The Captain's Summit (Disc 7) is pretty entertaining and is in high definition.    I highly recommend this collection.
B001TOD92C|3.0|I did not expect to like THE WRESTLER.  But this movie really surprised me.  Once you get pasted the endless punishment these men force on themselves in the ring, the brutal things they do to their bodies over and over again, there is a story told in THE WRESTLER that is definitely worth watching.<br /><br />THE WRESTLER tells the tale of a professional wrestler, Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson, very late in his career.  Wrestling is all this man knows, and 20 years after the fight of his life, he is still following the trail, picking up second-rate matches where ever he can, living paycheck to paycheck.  But then he has a major heart attack. He decides to give up wrestling, hook up with a stripper for whom he genuinely cares, and mend his relationship with his daughter. None of this works.  Wrestling is all he knows, and so he decides to go back into the ring, the only place where he feels truly appreciated and respected.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke does an admirable job as Randy the Ram, especially when you realize that he does all of his own stunts.  You genuinely come to like this character, and it is very easy to connect with him.  Rourke is dead on in his portrayal of a man whose professional image inside the ring is pure violence, but outside the ring, he is a gentle, kind person just trying to survive.  Marisa Tomei is quite good as the aging stripper, who has feelings for The Ram, but is not quite ready to admit to them.<br /><br />THE WRESTLER will give you a shocking look into the world of professional wrestling, and quite frankly is not for the squeamish.  The overall pacing is rather slow, and you have to be willing to just allow the story to unfold in its own manner.
B000GGSM76|3.0|Not their best... but love it.  The Blood is my favorite song on it.  Has the classic Close to Me on it, although my favorite version of the song is not on the album.
B000K7UG34|3.0|First off let me say that this is one of my favorite war movies of all time. I owned this previously on DVD and I have seen it at least a half dozen times.     PQ - The picture quality on this one was rather disappointing. I don't mind grain and actually prefer if over DNR. However, the image was soft throughout most the picture and quite honestly was only marginally better than my upscaled DVD of this movie. I would say that this and 28 Days are the worst Blu-rays I own in regards to picture quality. Both on Blu-ray only offer a slight upgrade from an upscaled DVD.     AQ -I first knocked one point off for no lossless track. I then knocked a second point off becuase I had to frequently adjust the volume. The action scenes were great and you feel like your in the movie. The dialog during these scenes is suprisingly good as well. The problem is when you go to the non action scenes you can barely hear the dialogue. Hence my one point deduction for this issue. I also knocked another point off for a flaw in the DTS audio track. I noticed towards the end of the movie that I was getting audio spikes. A couple of examples are when Mel Gibson returns home to his wife at the door and when the credits were rolling. I noted that my Pioneer Elite receiver was stating +4 for volume, it would go up for a second or two and then back down. This typically takes place at the begginning of the movie and I know it is encoded within the Blu-ray. I noticed this issue about 3 - 4 times so I was kind and only deducted one star for this issue.     Extras - Basically the same as the DVD release. Nothing really to add here other than the fact they are average in quantity. However, the content on the commentaries and some of the special features are really good.       Overall - If you have the DVD and a good to high-end upscaling DVD player then this is probably not worth an upgrade. However, I highly recommend this movie on Blu-ray or DVD.
B0013FSXT6|2.0|The first time I saw Eyes Wide Shut, I focused on the revelation of the perversions of the rich and powerful. They have moved beyond morality. They believe they can get away with anything. Sadly, as we see the financial corruption in plain sight today in our banking and investment world, and their incestuous relationship with Washington -- which is bailing them out with trillions of taxpayer dollars -- it is clear that the oligarchy thinks it can screw the \\"little people\\" with impunity. In the sexual realm, there may be no difference, and the film depicts this. People are just pieces of meat, to be used for whatever whim these super-rich elites should desire. I suspect there is more truth to this aspect of Eyes Wide Shut than we would like to believe.     The second time I watched Eyes Wide Shut, I concentrated more on its theme of fidelity, jealousy, interactions within a marriage relationship, and of course the \\"adventure\\" Tom Cruise's character has as a result. What is the message here? There is something to be said for the safety and stability of home, though fantasies do intrude and can lead to danger, even destruction.     The concept of the film, to address these issues, was probably a reasonable goal. However, for all the labor expended on crafting this film, all the little details that the film buffs and movie historians will obsess over, all the craft involved in filming and editing, the movie is ultimately a flop.     Why?    The dialog is laughably bad at times. Cruise's and even Kidman's acting seems incredibly phony. The overall plot probably would have served as the framework for a good movie, had the script and the performances not been so awful. Even the erotic scenes are not titillating, because of the revolting and bizarre atmosphere in which they are contextualized.     Perhaps worst of all, the couple at the center of this story are not interesting people. Cruise does not in any way appear or act intelligent enough to make a credible physician in this role, not just because he's a pretty boy, but he simply doesn't have the bearing of a professional man. And why should we care about these people, seemingly sleepwalking through their pampered and conventional lives? Yes, the troubling things that the good doctor gets himself mixed up in give us a sense that he has confronted evil, and we do root for him on that basis. But at the end of the film, we almost do not care whether this couple stays together or breaks up.     The movie is pretty to look at, at times, with low-contrast naturally-lit interiors. The \\"orgy party\\" scenes are a bit more stark -- with the pseudo-cultic circle of people in robes and masks in their ceremonial rites. However, there is nothing mind-blowing like 2001 or the battle scenes in Full Metal Jacket.     It's hard to recommend this movie. For all its apparent intentions to tell a good story and comment on relationships and society, it feels to me like a dud. Perhaps like me, you will have to watch it twice to convince yourself of that, but frankly I think it would be a waste of time.
0452289963|3.0|Needed the book for a class. Enjoyed the book.  Came in time when I needed it.  Thanks.
0671015206|5.0|I'm so glad I found this book. I heard Tom Leykis recommend this book on the radio awhile ago and I ordered it right away from Amazon. When I read it I instantly felt as if I benefited from what the book talks about.<br /><br />Even years later, I still flip through this book to remind myself of what goes on in the life of a millionaire. There's the exterminator who drives a bulky looking van with a bug on the roof of it, who nobody would think is a millionaire. What you'll discover when reading this book is that exterminator owns his business, has a dozen trucks just like that, and still goes on call every once in awhile just for the passion of his business. There's the stockbroker who's not a millionaire, and admits he'd probably make more money if he held onto his investments, but since he's staring at monitors all day he's tempted to actively trade.<br /><br />The book goes through statistics and research. You'll learn that most successful investors are not even high income earners, they are frugal, patient, spend more time researching their stock picks than they do buying and selling repetitively, and don't tend to wear expensive suits and watches as you may think.<br /><br />A great read for anyone.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|In spring of 2009 this music is still being played on the radio on almost a daily basis. The CD hasn't left my player in a month. I usually buy a CD and only like the one song I hear on the radio. With a little luck, I might like one or two others. Rarely do I enjoy an entire CD. This is one of the few. While I still love The Kill and From Yesterday, Attack and A Modern Myth are also favorites. Although tomorrow, Savior or Revolve could be the ones I listen to all the way to work.
1439138311|4.0|Both my husband and I read this during the last week.  It's rare when our tastes overlap.  This novel is set apart from many of the (wonderful) evocations of the immigrant experience due to its total lack of sentimentality.<br /><br />During the 1950s, a young woman with few job prospects in her Irish hometown, is encouraged to try life in Brooklyn NY.  Her brothers have all left home for work in England; one sister would stay behind  to provide company for their mother.  An Irish priest, home for a visit, makes it all happen.  Then what?  A very quiet, understated book unfolds.<br /><br />The author seems to create tension regarding almost every possible small social interaction. Toibin explores the idea of home, exile, not knowing what to hope for, and how our decisions are made.
1439130833|5.0|Without a doubt this book has done more for me then anything I've ever read.  I talk about the book The Secret all the time to everyone.  I think life is way to short to waste it, this book helps keep everything positive.  I have given this book and have had all my employees watch the DVD.  It has truly helped my business and the work place.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|i saw the movie in the theater and thought it was great.keith ledger did a fantastic job as the joker.the bluray is also excellent,great picture and sound.recommend buying this one,it's a keeper..
B001TOD92C|3.0|I never received The Wrestler DVD I ordered so when it was almost a month since the order was placed I asked for a refund and went to the local walmart and purchased the DVD myself although it was higher priced than Amazon. The seller blamed the post office which seemed reasonable so I will be more careful now when there is something I really want at a bargain price. It's the first time I was let down by Amazon so I am \\"twice shy\\" from here on. I did get the refund.
B001MYIXAW|3.0|First of all, I have not bought this. The movie itself I saw in the cinema and it is superb. As others have said, Magnolia has announced that the next pressing of this film (if there is one) will contain the theatrical subtitles. Don't buy this unless you truly believe that that will never happen. Personally, I am not confident that they will re-release it unless this version sells an extraordinary number of copies in North America, which it won't because it is a foreign film with very bad subtitles. I love the movie itself and will definitely buy a copy of the new version if/when Magnolia releases it. If after a year or two, Magnolia still has not released a new version, I may consider buying a copy and remuxing the theatrical subtitles in myself. The theatrical subtitles are available online. Although they are a bit hard to find. If you can get your hands on them, and are planning to watch on your computer, there are many players which will allow you to display the subtitles along with the movie. There is also a version of the movie itself with the theatrical subs already muxed in available on thepiratebay if you have a fast enough connection to download a 8 GB file. The only problem with that version is that the video has been recompressed to half size and the audio is the compressed version. So eventually I will have to buy a copy. Even if Magnolia doesn't budge on the subtitle issue (talk is cheap).
B0013FBS20|5.0|Great movie. I bought it used and was leary of that. The movie came exactly as described, used but in new condition. It was exactly that. Shipping was fast and they kept me informed of all info that was necessary. This was a very positive experience and I will do it again many times in the future.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love the Shred. It's a quick effective workout (especially when you'd rather be doing something else). There are 3 different levels so you can work at your own level until you're ready to move up. Great purchase!

B001R10BMS|3.0|It was good to finally have a clean, crisp copy of this unique piece of Bond paraphernalia.  The commentary was enlightening & the extras so-so but well worth having in the collection.  This is a work often jealously overlooked because it was not part of the franchise per se.  If you're a Connery as Bond fan then its a must.
1433502445|4.0|First - I love the single-column layout for the bible text. Wonderful - wish they all did it. The study helps are massive - you get a systematic theology in miniature as well as the textual helps and hints.  The standpoint is conservative Evangelical, but with some concessions, such as the cultural cop-out for \\"head-covering\\".  Subjects like the millenium are dealt with in a scholarly way - ie tell you nothing you didn't know, outline the various different opinions and sit on the fence!  But there are some very useful background tips, and they are up-to-date, as well.  Some ESV translations are weird, like \\"seah\\" for \\"measure\\" (AV). I have no idea what a seah is, but if it represents 2.3 litres then 3 seahs of meal is WAY too much for a loaf of bread! Modern translations are supposed to make it EASIER to understand?  But - still recommended.
6302470021|3.0|Well worth the purchase and is a zany addition to any Bond fan's film collection, despite it being outside the franchise.  The extras are extensive & informative and the movie itself has many fascinatiing moments even though it disintegrates into mayhem in the final quarter.  I'd still recommend it as fascinating & amusing Bond paraphernalia.
1592401791|5.0|Once I started to read this I actually I felt like I was right there in Geoff's shoes and assisting recording  music history.  This book opens up so much more insight into nearly every song that I had to relisten to my original MONO vinyl albums fresh again to hear sounds I never knew were there.  I became so absorbed whilst reading this on the train that I almost missed getting off at my station several times! No other book has had that effect.  This is a MUST have book for any Beatles fan and so much so, that I had to purchase my own \\"hard\\" copy (after reading a borrowed paperback) just to keep it as a reference next to my treasured Beatles vinyl albums.  From Dianne (Melbourne, Australia)
1932100660|5.0|You can't fight truth.  If you read this book and don't change how you live your life, you're in denial.  Buy this book for everyone you care about.  This book sheds light on the subjects that have always been in question regarding health, disease, diet, science, and much more.  Some of the best money I've ever spent.

1416511946|5.0|This insider's view of addiction is one man's descent into the hell of excess.  Through it all, you find yourself sympathizing with the main character, instead of simply condemning him for poor choices.  The message is that after a while, you don't do drugs anymore, they do you.
B000KIPT30|5.0|Peavy, Robinson & Houston use the Behringer 4-Channel Stereo Headphone Amp HA400 in recording sessions...and highly recommend this product. The sound quality is excellent...actually better than some other more expensive headphone amps on the market. Even with the thunder of an 8 piece drum kit, blazing electric guitar amp output, and a keyboard at near full throttle...the Behringer 4-Channel Stereo Headphone Amp delivers pristine clear sound on each channel to the band members. Buy it for the value...excellent price; but love it for the quality and portability.  [[ASIN:B000KIPT30 Behringer 4-Channel Stereo Headphone Amp HA400]].

B001FB4W0W|5.0|A guilty pleasure! Just got it last night and have even watched a couple of the episodes again.  A little cheesy at times but totally worth it.  The books are awesome too and this first season is based on the first book only, \\"Dead Until Dark\\". Sooooooooo goooood!!!

0316143472|3.0|This is the second book I've read by the author, with the other being _Naked_. As with his other work, _When You Are Engulfed in Flames_ is a collection of short vignettes, with each one being fairly independent of the other. Neither book is especially laugh-out-loud funny; rather, the humour is largely dry and somewhat absurd, with the narrator usually being in some surreal predicament (e.g. being the passenger in a big-rig truck where the driver detects his homosexuality and delivers suggestions of a sexual nature). However, unlike _Naked_, none of the stories are very compelling: there is no sense of adolescent growth, confusion, and personal danger. The last story on quitting smoking is unusual and interesting, but come on, who wants to read yet another story about a middle-age man trying to put down cigarettes?<br /><br />All in all, the book is a good read if you like mildly-humourous stories.
0743554450|5.0|\\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" as read by Atossa Leoni is an experience not to be missed.        As far as the author's work is concerned, all I can say without repeating what other enthusiastic reviewers have written before me is I that I liked this book so much I wish it had never ended.        As for the audio version, it is absolutely outstanding. I've usually been reluctant to have a book read to me until I heard this one. Much to my regret, I haven't seen any reviews of the audio-CDs on Amazon's reviewers' list. (If there are any, I missed them). It is a pity because Ms. Leoni's performance adds an incredible depth to the story.  Her beautiful voice keeps you enthralled to the end.  She impersonates the different characters in the story with great talent by changing the pitch of her voice, yet, it never sounds overdone.  Above all, I found that hearing the words in Farsi (i.e. pronounced as they should) really made the characters come to life. Now I understand how a Scheherazade was able to keep the King enthralled for a Thousand and One Nights...
B001CD6FKS|3.0|The important thing to remember about Speed Racer, is that it reveals the true meaning behind going to see a movie. Previously, I thought that the true beauty of a movie lay in the acting, writing, and directing. But now I realize that things like plot structure, set design, acting choices, are all just a vehicle to bring to audiences the Sparkly Light.    I watched this a few months ago. I don't remember much of what happened in the movie, except that it was entertaining enough. But my head is still reeling from having witnessed THE SPARKLE.
B001KZI2WW|5.0|I love wearing my Santa Cruz while coaching high school football. They are very easy to clean, just take out the insole and wash with either bleach or soap. I previously owned a pair of Sanuk's but they get too dirt and they smell. Not with the Croslite material in these babies, once again GREAT JOB CROCS.
B001EAWMGA|5.0|One of the best sci-fi movies in recent years.  I was shocked that this movie did not get more fan fare.  It is in the mold of Pitch Black meets Beowolf!  Can't wait for the Blu-Ray, I will buy that as well.
B000Y7U98C|5.0|I was truely surprised with the reactions to this film. Great plot, great cast, great director, and great special fx - Sunshine could've been a generic Hollywood flick. However, director Danny Boyle managed to tell the story very appropriately, using his cast of somewhat typical characters, often leading the audience to assume the occurance of plot cliches, but moving on to surprise with another twist of fate (or \\"intervention\\").     The characters were smart in dealing with all these mishaps and the mistakes and reactions to those mistakes were believable. Not to mention the marvelous special fx which were mostly comprised of non-CGI effects - something I'm entirely in favour of.     A lot of critics seem to be dissatisfied with the third act of the film calling it unnecessary, uneven, or heavy-handed, but I see it as simply an eclectic director allowing his eclectiveness (word?) take hold and guide his hand. I agree that it was an unnecessary addition, but how would the film have ended without it? Most likely, the crew would've ended up sacrificing themselves to reignite the sun even without \\"other intervention\\", which would've been a tragic but rather procedural ending. I think Boyle realized this and chose to spice it up a bit - which it does.    Is the film better than Trainspotting? No, but it IS a different film entirely. Boyle is a very talented director that always choses atypical projects. It'll be interesting to see what his next project will be.

B000002G7E|5.0|The greatest VU album of all time and perhaps the greatest album as well. Just as their debut was more of a collaboration with Nico and Warhol, White Light/White Heat was truely their own record. They never really surmounted this as the group tended to drift more towards a Lou Reed vehicle (especially in Loaded)and away from the visceral experimentation of White Light/White Heat.     And the album IS unrepentantly experimental, avant-garde, alternative rock (perhaps in its first appearance). The intensity of Cale's electric viola and Reed's dirty twangy guitar predate even the Stooges' guttural howl and perhaps even influencing Frank Zappa to a degree (Hot Rats and Weasels Ripped My Flesh, perhaps?). The Velvet Underground defied conventions in such a natural existential way that they changed how songs were written and performed.     Of course in the end, it's all pretentious artsy meanderings, but extremely interesting and informative. While it may not appeal to newcomers, White Light/White Heat is not only an essential VU album, but an essential rock album as well that every audiophile should own.
B001RIY4WE|4.0|\\"T2\\" has been reissued on DVD so often by Lion's Gate and its predecessor studios that it has become an industry unto itself. That said, this is the best edition so far but it is flawed. First up if you don't have the latest firmware updates, it won't make it past the Lion's Gate logo. Secondly, once you do have that firmware installed due to the design, Java menu or both it takes forever to load on most machines.<br /><br />The good news is that we get the bulk of the previous DVD ultimate edition from a couple of years back. That's also the bad news for those looking for new extras because there really aren't any just stuff repurposed from the previous release.<br /><br />As far as the film itself it looks good although it looks like an older HD transfer to me. There is fine grain throughout and contrary to an earlier review at the Digital Bits it doesn't quite look like it's been overprocessed with DNR. Evidently according to that site the actual encoding may have been part of the process that created the look that it was over DNR'd for this release. There's quite a bit of fine detail evident throughout on second viewing. I still thought the film looked a bit soft considering it was shot in Super 35mm and based on previous viewings of the film part of that could be due to the encoding as well as the an the possibility that this uses an older HD master (probably the one used to prepare the DVD version from a couple of years back). Either way while it doesn't look perfect, it's still a firm step up from the DVD and the previous theatrical version on Blu-ray.<br /><br />This includes all three versions of the movie (for the last version you have to input the date of \\"Judgment Day\\" to access the version with the alternate ending added to the film)including the theatrical and extended cuts of the movie on a single seamless branching edition of the film.<br /><br />The sound is spectacular with the finest 6.1 mix I've heard and it's Lossless for those that are interested.<br /><br />There's also an edition with a flimsy but attrarctive T2 head that divides up the extras and various editions onto separate discs allowing for a higher bit rate for the visuals.<br /><br />Reportedly after Cameron finishes \\"Avatar\\" (remember this IS a rumor), he'll turn his attentiont to remastering this again. You can get this version or wait until that reported version hits the market.

B001FB55HG|4.0|Despite the apparent flaws that lie within it, Terminator: Salvation manages to be a worthy installment of the franchise that James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger first birthed 25 years ago.  Taking place in the post-Judgement Day 2018, Terminator: Salvation follows the paths of John Connor (Christian Bale) and Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington); two men whose paths are interlocked with each other in the machine ravaged future world.  For Connor, he is the heralded savior of mankind, fighting Skynet and the machines that have been trying to kill him since before he was born at every turn, while trying to locate Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), a young man targeted by Skynet because he is John's future father.  For Marcus, the last thing he remembers was that he was on death row in 2003, and now finds that he is not himself these days to say it lightly.  Despite any misgivings anyone had about director McG (Charlie's Angels) at the helm, rest assured that he more than competantly handles some dynamite action scenes.  The only flaw of them is that the film's story is really nothing more than an excuse to get said action scenes going in the first place.  Still, you can't argue that Bale is more than solid as the grizzled John Connor, while Worthington gives a star-making performance.  Seriously, this guy is good and is a definite future star on the rise and worth looking out for.  Moon Bloodgood makes for more than eye-candy as pilot Blair, while Bryce Dallas Howard, Common, Helena Bonham Carter, and genre stalwart Michael Ironside don't really get to do too much.  There's plenty of odes to the first two Terminator films, whether it be through dialogue or the use of Guns N Roses' \\"You Could Be Mine\\" from T2, and the arrival of a familiar face as the film races towards its conclusion is a welcome sight indeed.  The only truly major flaw for me was the film's ending.  If you had heard of the leaked original ending to film, let's just say that that would have been a ballsier way to end the film, where as here we just get left with the door open for more struggles against the machines.  Still though, Terminator: Salvation is a big, loud, and enjoyable installment that is worthy of its predecessors, and in that respect alone, it is a solid success that is worth your time.ay to end the film, where as here we just get left with the door open for more struggles against the machines.

B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|Yes folks, Star Trek is back and back in a big way.  Be warned that spoilers are ahead, but considering the plot of J.J. Abrams' reboot of Gene Roddenberry's legendary franchise has been pretty much out in the open, I'm probably not saying anything that you don't already know anyway.  It all begins with the vengeful Romulan Nero (Eric Bana) coming back in time to wreak havoc on the Federation, so much so that it impacts the history and continuity that die hard Trekkies will no doubt find bones to pick with.  From that point forward, we are introduced to the young and reckless James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) who is convinced by Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) to enlist in Starfleet.  It isn't long before Kirk is at odds with Spock (Heroes' Zachary Quinto); who himself is an outcast among his own Vulcan people, and shares a rocky relationship with his Vulcan father Sarek (Ben Cross) and human mother Amanda (Winona Ryder).  The dynamic and groundwork laid of Kirk and Spock's relationship is what helps make Abrams' take on Star Trek so good, as he modernizes nearly everything that Trek fans hold dear (seeing young Kirk driving to the Beastie Boys' \\"Sabotage\\" may be overdoing it a bit, but hey...), yet he manages to pay enough homage to the original series while putting his own spin on things.  Pine and especially Quinto are surprisingly wonderfully cast and Kirk and Spock, as is Karl Urban as McCoy, Zoe Saldana as Uhura, Simon Pegg in an all too brief turn as Scottie, and Bana as Nero; who is undoubtedly the best Trek film villain since Khan.  John Cho as Sulu and Anton Yelchin as Chekov are fine in their relatively small turns as the film moves along with a nicely brisk pace, but the real surprise manages to be the emotional chords that Abrams pulls; whether it be the destruction of the planet Vulcan or the appearance and guidance of old Spock (Leonard Nimoy), who foretells his past self and Kirk alike that their bond and friendship is more than paramount.  With brilliant effects, epic space battles, and overall dynamite action scenes; this is the Star Trek for a new generation that we have all wanted and rightly deserve.  Now here's hoping that Abrams can manage to pull another rabbit out of his hat with the series someday further down the line.brilliant effects, epic space battles, and overall dynamite action scenes; this is the Star Trek for a new generation that we have all wanted and rightly deserve.

B000069KGM|5.0|I must admit a little bias: CTA was the very first album I plunked my hard earned cash down for in my young life when I was but a freshman in high school. I devoured the record at that time but through the passage of years lost my vinyl and my intimate connection to early Chicago. Sure, I heard them on the radio through the years but it wasn't until recently, when I was gifted a \\"Best of\\" collection by Chicago that I rediscovered my earlier fascination with this incredible work of art. That collection prompted me to seek out the full CD of this phenominal first record by surely one of the most talented of American rock bands. Scorching guitar, crisp horns, masterful drumming, soulful lead singing and angelic harmonies embodying diverse music styles that reflect the best of American pop music of the 20th century: jazz, psychodelic, rock, swing, modern classical, blues and funk, sometimes in the same song. From piano interludes worthy of George Gershwin, to horn sections that could have been done by Doc Sevrenson, vocal passages that Brian Wilson would have been proud of, and out of this world guitar licks that would have made Jimmy Hendricks take notice. It's all there. Chicago has made some other beautiful music since this, their debut, but no other album they have done since compares to this one. Nor do many others in the history of rock. A few others come to mind: Pet Sounds, Revolver, Days of Future Past, not many others of this caliber. Get it now, listen to it forever.
B00005YXZH|4.0|YHF may be slightly excessive in its sonic texturing, leading to a few pockets of dead noise here and there, but most often compresses and contorts into fascinating shapes instead. The disc still sounds about as superb an example at the expansive direction Wilco was taking their once traditional sound with hardly any residual pretension.

0446364495|1.0|I get depressed when I think about the fact that some people actually thought this was a good book.  A friend recommended this book to me, insisting that I read it because it was so great.  That recommendation was a sure sign that the friendship was doomed.    The writing is laughably bad.  The book is maudlin beyond comprehension.  The narration is pretentious, smug, and condescending.
B000YAA68C|5.0|P.S. I Love You has become one of my favorite movies.  I saw it in the theater when it first came out, but being able to watch the DVD has made it really special.

I ordered the book from which the movie was adapted and enjoyed it as well.
B00000269G|5.0|Never a big fan of live jazz recordings, which can be uneven and distracting, this is one where there are none of those issues. A recent article in the Wall Street Journal reminded me of George Avakian's influence on this work, so I decided to revisit it and write a review. It turned out to be a good project for a Memorial Day weekend, as this is a memorable and historic recording that does not disappoint. Despite it being a trio, Garner's piano is recorded much hotter than the bass and drums, and he makes the most of it. His Autumn Leaves is suitably rich, and his April in Paris is quiet, dignified, and understated (like April ... in Paris). As I've said, the production level is high, especially for a live recording, and Stanley Dance provides the informative, interesting liner notes. (For more of Stanley Dance's work, check out [[ASIN:B0000030E3 Earl Hines Plays Duke Ellington]] and Coleman Hawkins' [[ASIN:B0009RS5Y2 The Stanley Dance Sessions]].) My favorite song is They Can't Take That Away from Me, where his treatment of the oft-repeated notes and phrases seems to be setting the tone for some of the better later piano-trio versions (such as Billy Taylor's on [[ASIN:B000000ZEP Billy Taylor Trio]]). Top to bottom, this recording has great song selection, great production, helpful liners, and a great pianist treating a respectful audience to a lively evening of entertainment. You can't ask for much more than that from a single CD. Buy it.

B0019X3ZZY|1.0|Salo is one of those shibbeloths of world cinema that over the years has developed quite a little coterie of wide-eyed fans. It is supposed by some to be the sickest, foulest, most depraved film ever made. While it's not pleasant, Salo, which is based of course on the work of Marquis de Sade, the most boring author who ever lived--is almost a joke on the audience, an exercise in sadism of the \\"how much more tedium can we stand?\\" variety. If you've ever tried to plow through the work of the Marquis you'll understand why a film based on one of his books could easily put one to sleep. I actually watched this movie on magic mushrooms and nearly fell asleep (I've watched it under normal conditions and also was quite bored.) Pasolini's starkly architectural arrangements and formalist cinematography is a radical inversion of pornography, which is perhaps the whole point. The ritualist and slumberous pace renders the -orgies, s..it eating sequences, munching broken glass, eyeball gouging and whatever else is supposedly shocking about this movie dry as a mummy and a hundred times less erotic. Only a true masochist would appreciate the endless references to avant garde literature and philosophy, Blanchot, George Bataills, et al. It works as a heavyhanded satire of authoritarian forms--all license will be sanctioned, the moral will be shot, that kind of thing--although if you really want to laugh, you'll check out Luis Bunuel. I would sell my copy of the Criterion DVD but like to have it on hand just in case I need to brush up on my art-geek credentials. Never mind the sleeping pills, try Salo!
B001RTP48G|5.0|I consider myself a big hardcorde PSB fan since 1986. Hence I love and have all their albums, side collaborations, special projects, you name it. Even tough as I said I love all their material I have to say that this album really stands out better than previous albums. The last time I was so excited for a PSB album was back in 1993-94 with their album Very. I mean almost each song on this new album is a pop masterpiece and you can say like we said back in 93 that this is also a \\"very\\" PSB album. This have got to be one of the best gifts the PSB has given recently to us loyal fans. I can't get enough of this album although my absolute favorite track is Around The World. This is dance pop nirvana. Thank you PSB!!!! Other favorite band of mine is Depeche Mode that released their new album almost at the same time as the PSB but even tough I also like their latest album I think the PSB album is a superior release than the DM album.

0684803356|3.0|I disagree with the reviewers that bash the literal Spanish translation (I actually kind of enjoyed it for the most part), but I also agree fully with those who say that parts (loooong parts) of this book are slow.  Really slow.  I'm also with those who are annoyed by the constant use of Robert Jordan's full name.  He's the only \\"Robert\\" or \\"Jordan\\" in the book, so why can't Hemingway just pick one and stick with it?    An abridged version (taking out half of the flashbacks) would have kept up the pace of the story better, and at 300 pages or so this would have been a much more enjoyable read.  I finished the whole thing (500 pages) in about 3 days, but I'll admit to skimming through many of the flashbacks (the obvious exception being Pilar's flashback about Pablo killing the Fascists).    Overall - not great, but good enough to get through.  Would love to see an abridged version.

B001FB55HG|3.0|In the year 2018, humans are resisting the machines Skynet created called terminators. John Connor is the man who is destined to lead the resistance. Everything John Connor knows is turned inside out when he comes across Marcus Wright. Marcus was put to death by lethal injection in 2003 for killing his brother and two cops yet here he stands today. When an all out assualt by John's superiors is declared on Skynet, John finds out that Kyle Reese (the man who would eventually become his father) has been captured and will be caught in the blast, he knows his only choice is to join forces with Marcus, rescue the human prisoners, and bring Skynet down.<br /><br />Christian Bale may have been the biggest disappointment in this film. After everyone heard the sound clip of him blowing up on set at a cinematographer, everybody kind of wondered if Bale's success was getting to his head. Well, it just might have. That clip seemed to run through my mind an awful lot throughout the duration of the film. My biggest complaint was that John Connor yelled the majority of the time, even when there was no reason to. When he did talk normally, he used his Batman voice. It just didn't seem to fit since Bale is more than capable of altering his accent (Harsh Times, Rescue Dawn, The Prestige). It's an issue that was bound to come up eventually, but just didn't really click until now.<br /><br />The other weak link of the film had to be the dialogue. It is incredibly cheesy at times. At the beginning of the film, one of John Connor's superiors yells, \\"You tell those men to respond, even if they're dead!\\" It just seemed to be over the top more often than not. While the dialogue was a bit on the atrocious side, the story did have one interesting element going for it. The entire film revolves around this element and is really the only new factor brought in to the Terminator franchise. While the film had its low points, I kept thinking that the film at least had this going for it. Then the ending rolled around and just completely dropped the ball.<br /><br />With all the negative components of the film, there are still quite a few pieces of the puzzle that are worth mentioning. The action scenes are beyond superb. The camera always seems to be in the right spot at the right time and it isn't too close, which is a definite plus. It seems to be too close during action sequences and fighting scenes in most films these days and most of the action gets lost in the shuffle (Transformers is a good example). Being able to see everything without wondering what happened to this character or that character is a nice change. Something that should definitely happen more often. The entire scene with The Harvester is pretty phenomenal. There are also quite a few throwbacks to the first two films of the franchise. \\"Come with me if you want to live,\\" and, \\"I'll be back,\\" are both used in the film, Kyle Reese uses his signature weapon, a sawed off shotgun, Marcus Wright knocks the windshield out of the wrecking truck in a similar fashion the T-1000 did with the diesel in T2, John Connor cocking a gun and firing at a T-800 while being wounded much like Sarah Connor did with the T-1000 while being wounded in T2, and I'm sure quite a few more that I missed.<br /><br />Sam Worthington should be getting all the attention Christian Bale is for this film. He actually makes you care about Marcus Wright despite what he's done in the past. The way he portrays his emotions and how he's done these horrible things yet is a decent guy deep down inside just makes you want to root for him. Anton Yelchin also deserves a mention. His version of Kyle Reese is pretty much spot on with how you'd imagine a younger version of Kyle Reese to act. His mannerisms, the way he talks, everything. He nailed it.<br /><br />The sound was also spectacular. Sounds of huge terminators echoed off the walls and made the ground shake, helicoptor blades seemed to chop through the air in violent strokes, motorcycles screeched from one side of the theater to the other to sound like they were going right by you, and you could feel the area around you rumble whenever there was a huge explosion. The sound is definitely a huge aspect of an action film and it really delivered here.<br /><br />Terminator: Salvation is worth seeing, but being a fan of the franchise and having high expectations may leave you walking away in disappointment. The film doesn't really elaborate on the war between humans and machines or really add anything to the franchise, when all is said and done. If you can somehow remember the first two films yet not compare this sequel with them while ignoring plot holes, Christian Bale's over the top performance, and cheesy dialogue, then you may be able to enjoy Terminator: Salvation to its full extent. But if you're looking for a great action film, then this film delivers.heater to the other to sound like they were going right by you, and you could feel the area around you rumble whenever there was a huge explosion.

B001TH16DI|4.0|I didn't buy this set when it came out because of all the negative reviews posted here, but my friend bought it so I borrowed the set from him and watched all the films and the added bonus material that was made for this Blu-Ray release. After actually watching the films in the set, I believe all the negative reviews are misguided. These versions of the movies surprisingly surpassed my expectations, but there are still a few shortcomings to the set. Here is an overview of my thoughts:    Star Trek - The Motion Picture: Probably the weakest film of the set. Only the theatrical cut is included when there are two other versions I've seen: The remastered Director's Edition and the film with twelve minutes of scenes shot for television in it. I happen to prefer the film with the televised scenes incorporated in, myself. It's the version I grew up on. It's obvious that Paramount rushed this set out to conincide with the new Trek film in theaters rather than giving this film a thorough Blu-Ray treatment. The ideal release would include all the possible versions to choose from. Also, this film has a few grainy scenes that could've been cleaned up more, although this is probably more of a problem with the way the film was originally shot. For the most part, though, the film has been cleaned up considerably and this is the clearest I've ever seen it.    Star Trek II - The Wrath of Khan: The set proclaims that this is the only film to receive a true, thorough remastering while the others seemed to have been simply upgraded to Blu-Ray and released without the thorough remaster. Truthfully, I didn't notice any difference between this film and others in the set. ST II looked excellent but so did most of the other films. We only get the theatrical version of this film as well but that's an improvement. The Director's Cut used those damned alternate takes that ruined the movie for me. Good to have the theatrical version back in print.    Star Trek III - The Search For Spock: This is probably the best-looking film of the set visually. I didn't notice a single blemish on the screen while watching this one.    Star Trek IV - The Voyage Home: Another superior release in terms of video and audio quality. A huge improvement over the standard definition DVD version.    Star Trek V - The Final Frontier: Video quality was pretty good. The sound on this one was amazing. A great Blu-Ray to watch with a surround sound system.    Star Trek VI - The Undiscovered Country: This is the theatrical cut of the film, which excludes the character of Colonel West. Also excluded is the scene where, after Scotty shoots the Klingon assassin out the window, it is revealed that he is actually Colonel West wearing a Klingon mask. My friend saw this in theaters and swears up and down that this scene was in the theatrical version but I'm not sure. Either way, the film doesn't suffer without these scenes. It looks and sounds amazing and it's back in its original aspect ratio.    Bonus Features: There are some nifty new features included with this set. The bonus disc includes a round-table conversation with Shatner, Nimoy, Stewart, Frakes and Whoopi Goldberg. It was pretty entertaining but I don't think it's something to watch more than once or twice. The best bonus feature with this set is on Star Trek II where there is an interview with James Horner on how he came up with the now-classic score for the film. On Star Trek VI is a feature about a theatrical production of the Klingon Hamlet by Shakespeare that is pretty interesting.    The Packaging: It's nice to have these packaged in the standard way most multi-disc boxed sets are coming out these days. The way Paramount released most of the DVD boxed sets for the TV seasons was appalling; they were stuck in cheap plastic trays that were held together by packing tape and it was damned difficult to get the discs out of the holders without snapping the discs in half. I was forced to store them in a CD wallet instead to avoid damage to the discs or packaging. With this set, they're packaged more efficiently and conveniently. The covers of the individual movies each have a picture of a different crew member. This is okay, I guess, but I would've rather had each film's poster like the previous releases had. Also, the discs have a bland gray label on them with lettering identifying what movie you're watching instead of having a nice decorative photo on the label like some of the DVD releases had. This is a sign of how cheap Paramount can be at times.    Overall, this is an above-average set but could've been better. Paramount should've taken their time and put all the different types of releases on each Blu-Ray disc rather than only one version. You know they're going to re-release them again in different versions later. I also wish they would put each of these out individually instead of making them only available in one set. If this were the case, I'd wait on buying The Motion Picture until they come out with the definitive version, but I'd love to own II-VI right away. The set is worthwhile for now, however, and it's nice to see them at a decently low price this time around. Hell, the TV seasons on DVD are still around $50 most places and this is only $75-$90 for six films on Blu-Ray. The set is a good value. Also, the films looked pretty nice on Blu-Ray considering their age. I was pleasently surprised by this.

Percy has won some battles and lost others.<br /><br />During the course of these books, readers have seen Percy grow up and take on more responsibility.  His life has improved in the mortal world because his mom is now married to a good man, who even understands that Percy is the son of a Greek god.  However, his Olympian heritage offers more danger than ever.<br /><br />In the past books, Percy has learned that he may be the hero that can either save Olympus or doom it.  In this book he quickly learns that no matter what he chooses, he's probably going to die.  So not a good thing to learn.<br /><br />Another thing that struck us about the book was the serious tone of this one.  The book starts out with a few laughs then zips off to a mission with deadly consequences for Percy.  He's forcibly reminded how powerful his enemies are and how mortal he and his friends are.<br /><br />There's brief respite at the camp, but even that quickly passes as the stakes mount and the odds against rise.  There so many characters this time around that many of them don't get the on-stage time I would've liked.  I missed Grover, but I understood why he wasn't on-stage as much.<br /><br />After Percy's trip to Hades, on a secret mission that really surprised me, the book turns into a long, massive battle novel that reminded me a lot of the Iliad.  My son and I clung onto every page as we watched Percy take on opponent after opponent, and suffer through every setback that occurred.<br /><br />Rick Riordan's writing is intense and his choreography of the battle scenes is vivid.  I had no problem imagining all the fighting taking place in Manhattan.  Not only does the author use his considerable knowledge of Greek mythology in this one, but he also does a lot with the New York landscape.<br /><br />And just when you think you know how to everything's going to turn out and what's really go on, Riordan manages to throw twists and turns at you that let you know the game is still up in the air and no one knows who will survive until the end.  I kept figuring it out, then having to stop and reconsider, and I am proud to admit that I got most of it right, but only a page or two ahead of Riordan's reveals.<br /><br />This has been a fantastic series from start to finish, and even better because I got to share it with my son.

0743455967|5.0|As a writer myself, I tend to be suspicious of books \\"On Writing\\" and the likes, although I did read a few and looked up others. Oftentimes, it's good stuff provided you remain critical. With King's volume, you need not worry: this book is awesome.    The book is mostly divided in two parts. The first part is autobiographical; the second is more specifically about writing. Even though I'm a recent reader of King's, I still enjoyed his short autobiography a whole lot. And what he has to say about writing is good to hear.    But what I learned (again) with this, as I had before with every bit of non-fiction King wrote (mostly introductions and forewords) is that he is a good guy. I mean that! He strikes me as a fundamentally good person. That makes him inspiring in its own right, but then he also knows what he's talking about, and the reason I say that is because he KNOWS that he doesn't know how everything functions exactly. People who try to give tonloads of explanations on something might be compensating for something, but King doesn't need to, and he's convincing enough.     With every book I read by him, I gained more respect for him. This one is definitely a book I recommend to everyone into King, or into writing. I insist: it's inspiring! King is very encouraging and his goodness is contagious.     Needless to say that the prose itself is good stuff, and it made for a delicious read. The book is also quite emotional near the end as King tells of his accident, which he miraculously survived.    Whole-heartedly recommend.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Sure Cloverfield sometimes defies belief--the main characters walk miles upon miles without ever fatiguing, it feels that they should eventually put down the camera, etc--but the film is skillfully made, the characters feel real (I was suprised to find that I cared about some of them) and the monster-movie aspects are done far better than any other film I can think of in recent years; it's a polarizing film but I think a good one.
0679746323|5.0|Most of the books I read and review have only a handful of reviews, they're mostly books about poetry, Gospel cds, books about Zen, so in a way I don't belong in the canon of reviewers who've poured out their hearts and extensive knowledge to praise or condemn this book. But the book touches a subject you can't resist putting your two cents in about. And the subject is the success of evil in our world. I think people that look at the implied ideological debate miss the truth altogether. People like Mao only have one principle: self-advancement. In this they are exactly like trees that expand at the expense of smaller plants, animals that kill other animals for nourishment, people that push others aside to get on the subway. In other words, many things that happen everywhere every day. This is  one aspect of how God made the world. And He made it in a way that one of its primary methods of success should be deception, lying. This is part of how Nature works: deceptive coloration, sexual attraction, the sense of personal importance. So I enjoyed this book very much as a study of just that: Nature unaffected by any higher influence.<br /><br />Of course, \\"enjoying\\" a book about a merciless murderer is something weird only some humans can do. But it is quite possible to sit in your chair and have a warm sensation of outrage as you read about what must have been absolutely miserable moments in someone else's life. Here we \\"enjoy\\" millions upon millions of murders. It's amazing in a way because Mao's rivals for power were not in any way good men, but he was the most cunning, deceitful, the most willing to inflict pain, the most shameless. And win he did. Everyone on earth, practically, knows who he was, and he's even a hero to many.<br /><br />Of course, he is only one of many 20th century representatives of Hell, but the book makes a good argument in favor of the idea that he was the Devil's favorite.<br /><br />I've put all this in rather archaic, mythological terminology: God, devil and angels, which the authors don't do, since it's a more or less straightforward historical account. And like many other big, fat history books about monsters of the 20th century, this one just lays out the horrifying facts. But successful evil on this level shakes you up. This was a man whose indifference to the astounding suffering he caused was absolutely magnificent. You really wonder how can this is be so, and why everything happened the way it did. I felt the need for a more cosmological explanation for suffering on such a colossal scale. But maybe that's just me, and I know that suppositions about why evil thrives would violate the genre. But, still, I wish I knew.gy: God, devil and angels, which the authors don't do, since it's a more or less straightforward historical account.

B000035Z3K|2.0|The Bottom Line:    A movie whose iconic nature has prevented many people from realizing that it's actually a rather poor film, Dracula is only worth watching to see Bela Legosi provide the definitive version of the world's most famous vampire; aside from Legosi the movie has little to offer besides lethargic pacing, a complete anti-climax of an ending, and uninspired direction by Tod Browning.
B000JIJPZY|2.0|Don't buy this gym! Get a bigger one!     We have a small house so I thought the smaller gym would be a good idea, but I really regret it. The pieces don't fit together quite right and things hang a little crooked, and it was hard to put together. The toys are not very fun or educational. Last, the narrow width is really bad - once your baby gets excited in the gym and tries to roll over, they can't - they will be prevented by the narrowness and the toy bar. One one of the larger square gyms, rolling over would be no problem, and rolling over is such an important skill. I feel like another gym would have offered a lot more possibilities and growth! I would NOT buy this one again. While I am glad there is a low-priced option for people who really can't afford a larger gym, don't buy this gym if you can possibly afford a bigger one!

B000OPOAM0|5.0|The movie had me gripped from the eerie opening scene of Los Angeles in 2029: very bleak, dark, life-less, desolate, nothing moving except these huge menacing machines. And as they scourge the land, a message appears: The machines rose from the ashes of nuclear war. For years they had tried to eliminate the few remaining humans resisting them, but the final battle would not be fought in the future, it would be fought here in the present. Tonight.     With that cryptic message, the heart-pounding music begins and one of the most awesome opening title sequences starts and \\"The Terminator\\" is underway. Few movies have the audacity and confidence in their audience to reveal their plots as gradually as The Terminator. Unless you've seen one of the other Terminator movies you won't fully understand the plot until half-way through. It's a movie that's got it all: action, horror, a love story, and, above all, old school science fiction. It features Arnold Schwartzenegger in his most famous role, as the most merciless cybernetic organism to ever grace the silver screen (even more merciless than Darth Vader!). And you would have to be a machine to not be moved by the ending.    In the rare event that you know little or nothing about \\"The Terminator\\" franchise, this movie is much more enjoyable if you don't know the plot of the movie before you see it. This movie is worth the price so don't read any more reviews after this one. Just buy it.
0307408833|1.0|I am a professional chef who cooks for gluten-free, vegetarian, and vegan diets.  I looked forward to the release of this book with great anticipation.  I realize that the author spent a great deal of time perfecting recipes for her bakery but these recipes don't translate well to home cooking.  The textures are rubbery, flavors are bland, and errors exist in the instructions.  The concept and photography are lovely; if the recipes themselves can be edited and/or improved, I'd be delighted to own a copy.  As for this edition, mine is going up for sale.

B001L1S1SK|5.0|Ugly Betty's 3rd Season continues to deliver a show with a lot of laughs and a lot of heart.<br /><br />The show's writing, performances, story lines are solid.<br />In this season we see the disappearance of some key characters and the addition of new ones.  All new characters are played by strong actors and even though they are mostly \\"bad\\", they are good to watch....<br /><br />On removing some characters:  Personally, I was sorry to see Christina go.  I loved this character and her relationship to Betty. I am not sure why she was taken out of the show.  I hope they replace her with a quirky fashion designer at Mode who will be instrumental in getting Betty to change her look.<br /><br />While I liked Molly's character and the actress who played her, I found that there was no chemistry between Daniel and her.  I am glad that she was let go, although of course it was sad that they did it through a terminally-ill story line.<br /><br />Henry came back for a short stint at the end of the season.  I have loved this character and was very unhappy to see him leave the show, especially with the pregnant-girlfriend story line.  But oddly enough, I was not happy to see  him again.  That's because Matt, Betty's new boyfriend, is just amazing.  It's a tribute to the writers and the actor who plays Matt that after Henry's story line, I was really into the Betty/Matt story.  I was sorry to see how they ended the season; and have no hope that they will hook up again.  That's a shame.  But it's plots like these that make the show interesting.<br /><br />The actor who plays Mark continues to give amazing performances, effortlessly switching from bad to good guy.  Also excellent performances by the actresses who play Amanda, and Hilda.<br /><br />One of the weak links in the show right now, is Ralph Macchio, who plays Hilda's new boyfriend....There is no chemistry there, and it's hard to see Hilda falling for him considering the last 2 boyfriends she had...He still has a baby face and every time I see him, I  think of his role in The Karate Kid.  They need to give him a devilish side, or get rid of this character all together.<br /><br />The other problem I find with  the show is that it's becoming increasingly difficult to believe that after 3 seasons, Betty has not learned a single thing about fashion. She continues to dress in the ugliest, most miss-matched outfits ever imaginable.  For someone who is so intelligent, it's hard to accept that she doesn't adapt some of the fashion savvy around her, and update her look a bit. I understand that the show is about \\"Ugly\\" Betty, but it's just not credible that working in a high-fashion environment does not rub off on her, even slowly, bit by bit, season by season.<br /><br />On the other hand, it's true that there will be a huge impact when we see Betty lose her ugliness (very likely in the show's final season).  And truth be told, at present, it is now very clear that the only ugly thing about Betty is her wardrobe.  Her personality is so charming, her love of life so contagious, her heart so big, that it's impossible to think of her as ugly, and more and more likely to see her beauty.<br /><br />Regardless of the couple of problems I mentioned, the show still deserves 5 stars.  The good elements more than make up for the bad.<br /><br />One final note.  At the end of season 3 we see Daniel and Betty getting even closer together, due to Molly's death, and Betty's breakup with Matt.  I don't know if the writers are planning for Daniel and Betty to end up together, as was the case in the original Spanish-language telenovela on which this show is based (\\"Betty La Fea\\"); but if this is the case, they do seem to be doing a good job in having Daniel's personality evolve enough to fall in love with someone for her inner rather than outer beauty.<br /><br />For this and all the other good reasons, this show is definitely BEAUTIFUL.in The Karate Kid.

B001EAWMGA|3.0|An alien named Kainan crash-lands on the planet Earth sometime during the reign of the Vikings.  He brings with him a monstrous carnivore hell-bent on killing and eating everything in its path.  Together, Kainan and the Vikings must band together to save themselves...assuming the primitive weaponry is a match for the alien predator.<br /><br />OUTLANDER isn't quite what it could have been.  It's riddled with cliches--lines, dialogue, camera-angles, plot twists, all erected upon a mountain of predictability.  However, OUTLANDER has three things going for it that help to elevate it (if only slightly) above the level of its peers.  The first is Jim Caviezel, who brings surprising strength to the lead role.  The second is John Hurt, as the leader of the Viking tribe that initially captures Kainan, only to come to rely upon his expertise.  The third is an interesting plot twist that questions the viewer's sympathy: Do we side with the dashing and unbelievably handsome alien warrior, or the ugly, supposedly blood-thirsty animal?  This level of discomfort isn't exploited nearly as well as it should be; suffice it to say, the carnivore has good reason to hate Kainan, and vice versa.<br /><br />Note that I didn't include Ron Perlman anywhere; he is grossly under-used, in a throw-away part that is a complete waste of his talent.  This is just one of many disappointments that makes OUTLANDER a mixed-bag of a film.  It could have been a truly thoughtful film; instead, it's little more than some dazzling special effects and a totally awesome \\"villain.\\"  Of course, that's probably more than enough to keep most viewers happy; and if that's what you want, then OUTLANDER certainly delivers.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|From the first episode I was enchanted. Every other Vampire Movie/Series has been either a bad B-Movie or just lame graphics/story line. UNTIL Ture Blood. The most engaging, captivating strangly Hypnotic series. EVERY character adds there own flavor to the show and if you have seen the series or not. This collection far exceded my expectations.Season 2 promises a whole new perspective on these engaging characters. I just recieved Season 1 on Friday and watched every Episode. Before I knew it the Sun was coming up and it was time to retreat to my coffin. NOW THE BEST PART OF THE SEASON ONE DVD'S- Pay attention while watching, you will be surprised at the small additions these episodes have been splashed with. Things HBO left out. What a gift,for all of us. Props to the DVD Editors. What a great treat that was. This was mean't to be a gift. Looks like my friend is geting Perfume instead. I'm keeping this for myself. BRING ON SEASON 2. AVL Forever.
B001EO2UJK|5.0|Para alguien se hace fanático de Genesis recientemente, esta colección es imposible de que falte. Genesis en la época de Peter Gabriel era una obra maestra tras otra y acá estan todas reunidas. No analizaré disco por disco, sino que la colección. Partiendo por la caja, es bella, con detalles que hacen que den ganas de cuidarla y no prestarsela a nadie. Al igual que los discos, sobre todo el The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway, es genial, es un libro empastado que contiene 3 discos!. Los extras, en particular los videos son buenisimos. El único detalle es que creo que deberían haber sido distribuidos de otra forma, ya que el Nursery Cryme no trae videos y el Foxtrot trae una presentación de la época del Nursery Cryme. Al igual que la presentación en Bataclan que es de la época de Foxtrot, que viene en Selling England By The Pound.   A pesar de ese detalle (mínimo por lo demas), esta colección es absolutamente recomendable, una muy buena inversión!
1416550542|3.0|The book keeps switching between the past and present with each chapter which I found annoying at times.  The three main characters are likeable but many of the characters in this book waste their lives dwelling on the past or wanting what they don't have.  But maybe that's the moral of the story.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is the 1st exercise video I ever purchased and it really works!!!  I am 56 yr. old, approx. 50 lbs overweight, and haven't exercised in a few years. After 1 1/2 weeks, I noticed a flatter stomach and the weight peeling off!!  The first 2 days were tough and I thought I was going to DIE, but I didn't give up.  I couldn't do the entire 1st workout without stopping for a few minutes, but I gradually worked up my stamina.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS VIDEO to the BEGINNER who is totally out of shape and really wants to see quick results!!!   JUST TAKE YOUR TIME AND DON'T GIVE UP!!!  Each segment is ONLY 20 MINUTES!!!!  That's just 20 MINUTES a day for a GREAT workout!!!!!
B00005N6KG|1.0|I decided to try these based on all the positive reviews and the price.  I run 3 days a week and lift at the gym 2 days. These failed the workout test.    They kept falling off in the gym during various movements and, while running, they invariably needed adjusting.    They may be OK for casual listening but are not intended for sports
B000EQ47HC|4.0|Popular opinion is that this is the weak followup to Boston's classic debut album. The truth is that half of this album represents Boston's BEST work of all time, while the other half is filler. The first half of this album is terrific, from the opening chords of the title track to \\"Man I'll Never Be\\", this is ace stuff. The trouble lies entirely on side two, which is generally sub-mediocre. The hidden treat on this side is \\"Used to Bad News\\", which is a great sonic pop bon-bon. Tom Scholz' record label rushed him to release the record, and it's painfully obvious on the remainder of the second \\"side\\" (second half for you CD fans). Nonetheless, the good stuff is so good, I'm inclined to give the whole album 4 stars. Make your own compilation by jettisoning the remainder of side two and adding most of the first LP, and you have one for the guitar gods' time capsule.<br /><br />dap
B001XJEKGC|5.0|I bought the CD and the DVD versions of the Clapton/Winwood MSG as a combo from Amazon.  The CD (which I reviewed in its listing) I gave four stars to - it's very good, but now that I've seen the DVD, I'd give the DVD five stars, mainly for what it adds to the equation: the visuals.  While it might seem counter-intuitive to grade musicians of this caliber by `what you can see', the DVD added such a great dimension to the show, in terms of WATCHING them solo and seeing the interplay between them, and their excellent band (these guys have serious CHOPS), that I think the DVD ups the ante, hence I'm giving the DVD 5 stars.  The musicianship is excellent (they make it look so EASY....i guess that's what the best guys do when they're on their game?  Plus they're clearly having a good time up there), and it's great to be able to see who's playing what (namely, that Winwood plays guitar on the first two cuts, and then on several others toward the end - he's a very good guitarist, and holds his own with Clapton, sometimes trading solos.  I wasn't exactly sure what SW was playing on, just from listening to the CD - Chris Stainton is the other keysman).  The picture is very good, and the camera work/composition is excellent, with nice close-ups and some striking angles where they got both guys in the same shot, Winwood on keys and Clapton on guitar.  Some have pointed out editing inconsistencies w/ the visuals, but I didn't really notice it, as I was enjoying the show so much.  I listened to the sound in DTS-mode (as opposed to straight 2-channel stereo) and it was excellent - really good mix - much preferable to the CD mix.  I guess if you couldn't be there, this DVD (with a good A/V system) is about as close as you can get.    As for the extras on Disc 2, they're good - interviews, some background on Clapton and Winwood's 60's exploits, their time together in Blind Faith, and behind-the-scenes prep for the MSG shows.  There are also a couple of bonus cuts, which didn't makethe `main' concert as presented on Disc 1 - I noticed in spots, there were synch problems (from watching the drummer) between audio and video, but the extra cuts are nonetheless good (including a 7 minute \\"Crossroads\\").  Overall, the disc set was definitely worth the dough, and if you're a fan of either Clapton or Winwood, and have any inclination to buy this, then absolutely do so.  You won't be disappointed.
B00004ZDVQ|4.0|This collection consists of 12 of Wonder's best '70's tracks, plus four tracks that were new at the time of this collection's release. What's amazing is that the new tracks are on a par with the best-of material. The timelessness of this music--it mostly sounds as fresh today as it did when it was recorded 20-25 years ago--makes a strong argument for Wonder as THE artist of the '70's. What keeps this collection from a full five stars is the exclusion of any material from his '60's and early '70's Motown albums. And what makes listening to this album a bit sad is the realization that he would never really hit these artistic heights again.<br /><br />Note that the four star review is for the music contained on these CDs. The mastering on this \\"remastered\\" package, issued around 2000, is rather poor--very loud, very trebly, not very much like the original (LP) album release. You would be better advised to seek out the earlier Motown issue. It isn't a sonic wonder, either, but it sounds better than this.<br /><br />dap

0743454537|2.0|If there is one thing to commend Jodi Picoult on, it's this: she has a talent for finding new, original, and provocative subjects on which to base books. The premise here is that a 13-year-old girl, whose transplants keep her older sister alive, is suing for the right to her body to avoid being forced by her parents into donating a kidney. Sounds pretty interesting, right? And I'll give it to her, Picoult does a good job of delving into the psyches of every member of the family--it's a difficult situation, and nobody is black and white.<br /><br />However, as far as the quality of the book, it's not good. It starts off well, but goes downhill as the story progresses, culminating in a trial full of gag-inducing melodrama. Also, Picoult's choice to use multiple narrators for this novel was a poor one, especially in the case of the males, who don't sound at all like real men. To try to distinguish the individual characters' voices, she resorts to cheap tricks, such as Brian's over-reliance on hackneyed celestial metaphors. In the meanwhile, the relationship between Campbell and Julia (neither of them members of the family in question) is distracting and is more wish-fulfillment fantasy than realistic. And the treatment of Jesse, the older brother, is simplistic and annoying.<br /><br />Picoult is clearly a bestselling author, but of the \\"cheap popular fiction\\" variety. For solid characterization or literary style, look elsewhere.
0307408833|4.0|First of all, I have no food allergies and neither does anyone in my family.  I'm a mother of two young children (ages 2 and 8 months) who simply wants a healthier version of my favorite treats so that I won't feel guilty sharing them with my toddler.  I used to bake once every year, if that, and pretty much enjoyed freshly baked goods from local bakeries.  So, my expectations are that it has to taste good for any of this to be worth it.    I preordered this book on a whim.  I had never been to the bakery in New York and I don't think the L.A. bakery is open yet.  Ever since the book arrived, I have looked through it every day.  This book is a visual masterpiece!  I love everything from the font and photographs to the colors and layout.  It makes me want to bake... and buy expensive, hard-to-find ingredients because, what the heck?,  it's part of the challenge.       So far I have baked the chocolate cupcakes (chewy and brownie-like, just like Erin says it should be), banana bread with chocolate chips, and the double chocolate cookies.  Everything has turned out well.  In fact, the banana bread was better than the non-vegan kind, and you couldn't even taste the flax seed meal in the cookies, which were incredibly delicious.   I mentioned that I am NOT a baker, right?  I am a very detailed person though and I guess my advice would be to follow every little step exactly as it is written.     Now, I've read a lot of the reviews and have been a bit surprised by some of the negative comments.  This is alternative baking, people!  The fact that it tastes as good as the real thing is quite an accomplishment!  Perhaps the frosting isn't the real NYC-shots deal, I don't know because I haven't made it yet, but I really wouldn't expect this woman to spend years perfecting her recipes only to spill every little secret on the pages of her book. I'm just excited that there are healthier options out there.... and with such style to boot!  I think this book is great fun and worth every penny.    ** I've lowered my original 5-star review because apparently the first few recipes I tried were the most successful.  The cinnamon toastie was a disaster and I never got the frosting figured out either (it was just OK, texture was really off.)  So, while I still make the scones every so often because they're so darn good, I am cautious with the recipes now.   I still highly recommend it and there are amazing ideas in here for alternative baking, but not everything has turned out as expected for me. **
0553381687|4.0|I started reading this series after seeing all the recommendations tagged on to Wheel of Time reviews, and at first was disappointed. The prologue... been there, read that. And the book does start off slowly. The good news is that the pace picks up, towards the end of this one and in the sequels--by the time I finished A Storm of Swords (the 3rd book, and my favorite) I was in love with the series. I didn't think I would want to reread A Game of Thrones, but now I have, and found it much better the second time around, in the context of the series as a whole. The thing is, this book is mostly setup; well-written and engaging setup, as you can tell by the multiplicity of 5-star reviews, but still setup.<br /><br />As far as what sets Martin apart from other fantasy authors... well, there's the dialogue. He knows how to write it. And it's often funny. Believe me, you start to need the comic relief. And there's the way he subverts expectations... several of the characters I expected to be major villains in this story either died unexpectedly early or have morphed into heroes. Then there's the way he assumes an intelligent readership. The backstory, instead of being handed to you, is something you have to piece together, and the answers to big mysteries are not obvious. And there's the political intrigue, which deepens as the series goes along. Martin knows how to write this stuff. You won't see any Robert Jordan-style conferences with women sitting around smoothing their skirts and glaring at one another... in Martin's world, politics means raising armies, arranging marriages, ordering assassinations, etc. He's well-grounded in the historical period as well: wounds fester, they leave scars, and so forth. No magical shortcuts here. Magic in fact is quite understated here, although there is more in future books.<br /><br />There are a couple misconceptions I would like to counter, though. One: don't be scared by what people say about the death rate! Yes, there is a lot of death in these books, as there was in real medieval wars. However, very few \\"viewpoint\\" characters (the ones with chapters named after them) have died so far, at a rate of less than one per book. That's not bad when we have 14 of them by book 4. Occasionally a character you care about will die, and brutally, but Martin's been quoted saying there are several he cares about too much to kill. So don't worry, some will survive! Reviews on this site actually led me to expect far more death than there was, and to assume characters dead multiple times, only to see them return. If most of your reading (like mine) consists of standalone, non-fantasy fiction, you probably won't be too shocked. Just don't expect every important character to survive everything, as they do in most epic fantasy.<br /><br />Two: the \\"gray\\"ness: there are people of real integrity in these books, as there are brutes who revel in cruelty. As well as a lot in between. The thing is, Martin's good guys have to make a lot of tough decisions, especially those in positions of power; this isn't a \\"just be virtuous and everything will fall into place\\" sort of world.

However, very few \\"viewpoint\\" characters (the ones with chapters named after them) have died so far, at a rate of less than one per book. That's not bad when we have 14 of them by book 4. Occasionally a character you care about will die, and brutally, but Martin's been quoted saying there are several he cares about too much to kill. So don't worry, some will survive! Reviews on this site actually led me to expect far more death than there was, and to assume characters dead multiple times, only to see them return. If most of your reading (like mine) consists of standalone, non-fantasy fiction, you probably won't be too shocked. Just don't expect every important character to survive everything, as they do in most epic fantasy.    Two: the \\"gray\\"ness: there are people of real integrity in these books, as there are brutes who revel in cruelty. As well as a lot in between. The thing is, Martin's good guys have to make a lot of tough decisions, especially those in positions of power; this isn't a \\"just be virtuous and everything will fall into place\\" sort of world.

0307408833|2.0|I share other reviewers' opinions - the title of the book is misleading. I was aslo looking for gluten free recipes that did not include a lot of sugar. Many of the recipes in this book don't fit the title. While she does use agave which is supposed to have less of an impact on the body as compared to sugar, there are other forms of sugar in many of the recipes. In addition, for those of us who can't have gluten, spelt is not an ingredient we can use.<br /><br />The pictures are beautiful and the recipes are different than other gluten free cookbooks. However, I did not try any of the recipes and returned the book.
B001FB55HG|5.0|If you're a big fan of Terminator 1 & 2, then I highly recommend this movie. This is one of those movies you should see in the theatre for big screen and sound. One of the few movies I've seen in my life that far exceeded my expectation. Great action, story, special effects, not a dull moment in the movie that I can recall, great cast as well. This movie is so good even a Governor of a big state paid a visit. I hope this movie will make so much money in the box office they will not even think twice about making another one. I am hoping and looking forward to that and also to the release of blu-ray later this year. I hope everyone will love and enjoy this movie as much as I did !!!

B001FB4W0C|5.0|I can't wait until the release of the Season 4 DVD set!  I worship Eric Kripke! He and the team went all out this season! I was shocked, surprised (lesser form of shock), devastated and amazed. Season 4 wasn't as lighthearted as the first 3 seasons. I broke out my box of tissue often as I watched Kripke and Company tear the brothers apart, beginning with Sex and Violence. The following 8 episodes were just as brutal as the wedge between the boys deepened and the evil seemed undefeatable.  This show is well written, well acted (love Jensen & Jared) and well delivered. The emotional roller coaster ride that it took me on was almost too much to take toward the end of the season. I need an intervention, but if offered a trip to Supernatural rehab, I would have to refuse. This is the best television series ever! Nothing comes close to this. Nothing.
0307269752|5.0|I love the unfolding sense of discovery that comes with a really well-written first novel.  And there's the growing apprehension that I may be reading a one-off and that all of the writer's energy and talent went into that one book, never to be repeated. But it is a fairly unique experience to read a book and understand that this was the first of three and there will never be any more. Whether or not Larsson pulled off in his second effort the wonder that is this book will have to wait until later this year when \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" is released. My bets are on a quality repeat, especially since the star of his second book is the Asperser's-driven, 24-year-old computer genius we first meet in \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\".  In fact, our troubled whiz-kid hacker, Lisbeth Salander, IS the girl with the dragon tattoo.<br /><br />This story isn't really hers.  It mostly belongs to Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist and publisher who has just had one of the worst years of his life. He has been set up, then successfully sued for libel, and now must face financial and professional ruin, as well as a prison sentence. Enter an aging industrialist with a problematic family who, for reasons unfathomable to Blomkvist, wants him to find out the true story behind the murder of his niece - decades before.<br /><br />Lisbeth's story is gently intertwined with the action until the two stories join and move forward with force. A word of warning - there is much necessary expose at the start of the book and the going is a little slow. It is worth the effort to track the characters and their environments. And, unless you are quite savvy in the world of international banking, business, and financial journalism, this is a great pr&eacute;cis.<br /><br />I liked the story, loved the characters, and was sorry to see it end.  Ultimately, that's the best a reviewer can say. And I'm happily awaiting the release of the next two in this incredibly finite series.
B001FB55HG|3.0|It was announced that the Terminator franchise would be relaunched and I was intrigued...even though Arnold Schwarzenegger was busy playing California's Governor and could not really participate...I became excited by the prospect of finding out where the story would go after the end of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. And then it was announced that Charlie's Angels helmer McG would be calling action on the film and I got nervous...When Christian Bale was cast as John Connor--I got really excited again...Given all of those ups and downs before the release of Terminator Salvation I suppose it's fitting that my feelings for the finished product ended up being pretty mixed...    The film opens--it is 2003, death row inmate Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) is housed at the Longview Correctional Facility where he meets with Dr Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter), a representative of Cyberdyne Systems to donate his organs and tissue for what he believes will be a good cause.    He wakes up 15 years after his execution, in 2018, to find a desolated downtown Los Angeles...    At the same time, John Connor (Bale) on a nearby Skynet base, is the sole survivor of an assault. He discovers plans to develop the T-800, as well as a Skynet transport carrying captured humans, who are being moved to Skynet's main base of North American operations in San Francisco.    Connor returns to a nuclear sub acting as Resistance headquarters and tells Resistance leader General Ashdown (Michael Ironside) of his discovery. Ashdown informs Connor that, even though it will result in the deaths of most of the prisoners, an offensive against the Skynet base in San Francisco is planned to take place in four days. When Connor asks why it would be in four days, it is revealed that the Resistance intercepted a transmission from Skynet, listing people that they planned to kill in four days: first on the list is Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), second is Connor, and the rest are the command staff of the Resistance. The resistance has also discovered a frequency that could possibly be used to force Skynet machines to shut down. After leaving the submarine, Connor speaks with his second in command, Barnes (Common). He also reunites with his wife, Kate (Bryce Dallas Howard).    Meanwhile. after stealing clothes from a dead Resistance fighter, Marcus makes his way through the city to discover that the only human survivors there are a teenage Kyle Reese and his young, silent, child companion named Star (Jadagrace). .    As Marcus and Kyle leave L.A. city behind to meet Connor, their vehicle comes under fire by various terminators, which takes Kyle and Star alive in a round up of humans to transport to a prisoner camp. Marcus, however, is left behind.    Connor is determined to discover why Skynet is taking human prisoners. The Resistance picks up unusually concentrated machine activity in the Los Angeles Basin and dispatch fighters to intercept the hunter-killers in the area. One of them, Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood) a pilot, is shot down and rescued by Marcus, and the interception fails.    The script from John D. Brancato & Michael Ferris sets up things nicely--allowing for plenty of T-action....But...I know that we are dealing with the end of the world type stuff--I must say, the film is almost too dark...I missed the type of humor (provided by Arnie) from the other films...Everything was too serious...    McG staged some great action scenes and the late great Stan Winston's crew pulled off some great FX and all--But this is a summer flick that's STILL not all that fun to watch--    As Connor Bale was just OK--which in and of itself was a surprise--Was I expecting too much from him? Maybe...I was more impressed with Worthington as Wright--Whose character had an engaging arc in the film and he really pulls it off.    Yelchin's Reese served as more of a major \\"Save him or we wreak our future\\" plot point than anything else. Hopefully he's got more to do in the next one.Howard, Bloodgood and Carter are there yes--but are pushed out to focus on Bale and Worthington.    Salvation is solid but has tonal issues that really took away from the cool factor--    Apocalypse is serious biz...But as a Summer Blockbuster it need not forget to have fun.
0312539517|3.0|I'm not a fan of historical novels, especially involving venerable figures, so I wasn't prepared to like this, but I am fascinated by the story of George Mallory, and I decided to give it a try.  This book was to all appearances a faithful account and almost certainly used letters and contemporaneous accounts as a foundation. Yet, the language didn't really ring true - perhaps too modern? And certainly too florid for the time in the personal relationships. It wasn't a waste of time, but it did cement my opinion that historical novels aren't my fare. For a student of the genre, this might work very well.
B000BRBA8S|5.0|For the typical American audience, 2046 can be a puzzle.  Americans tend to like their movies the way they like their novels, with a straight line progression of plot.  For those who can allow themselves the luxury of going with the flow, 2046 is a stunning achievement.  What this film does is to present more of a mood, spliced with wispy tendrils of thought that ebb and flow in both temporal directions.  Tony Leung is Chow, a Chinese author who writes what he considers second rate soft core porn.  He dreams of a mysterious land called 2046, which, in this film, is the room which, because of tragic memories, resonates with equally tragic yet frequently impish overtones.  His stories are full of tormented souls, much presumably like himself, who need to escape the unhappiness of the past by seeking in the present a key to the future. He peoples his characters as passengers on a train, some of whom have sex with automatons who resemble previous lovers.  Part of the joy of 2046 lies in the audience's task of distinguishing life on the train from life in Chow's daily existence.  Chow is a drinker, a gambler, and an inveterate womanizer, who nonetheless possesses a spark of decency that forbids him from taking sexual advantage of teenage girls who throw themselves at him. His life is a montage of regrets, beginning with a  prostitute who may or may not be the same girl from his past.  He courts her but sets some basic rules: their relationship will be platonic until she wills otherwise, and if and when she wishes sex, then their relation can be neither serious nor permanent.  She agrees, but when she falls in love with him, he stuns her by adhering to their original agreement.  In strolls another girl (Maggie Cheung); this one is the daughter of his landlord. She loves a Japanese but her father hates all Japanese and forbids her to see him.  Chow falls in love with her but refuses to even try to get physical.  Chow even helps her to marry her Japanese boyfriend. Enter the third female (Gong Li), known as the Spider Woman, who helps him to regain losses suffered in a casino.  Throughout these temporally floating affairs, Chow keeps himself aloof from a too deep attachment.  He may fall in love with one or more women, but he refuses himself the luxury of becoming overly emotionally dependent on any.  The filming style does not ever sink into a raw herky-jerky morass of illogic. By the time Chow goes through his last woman, he teaches himself the valuable lesson that regardless of how much one woman may have meant to him either in his murky realm of 2046 or in his even murkier real life, he can never go home again.  All that he and presumably the ones reading his cheap stories or watching this masterpiece can do would be to press on and face the next challenge, which in his case is to chain smoke as he awaits a woman who reminds him of yet an earlier version of herself.e third female (Gong Li), known as the Spider Woman, who helps him to regain losses suffered in a casino.

B001I0T92Q|5.0|I purchased this with two 8gb sandisk microSD's to go in my PSP.      This adapter is made of very thin plastic and you have to be careful not to torque it when handling.  Installing the microSD cards was a very simple matter, they slide right into place and look to be easily removable as well.     I followed the advice of several other reviewers and formatted through the PSP.  Formatting was instant and I ended up with ~14gb of free space to play around with!      Read/write times are great when transferring via USB from my PC.  One minor gripe is that I have a bit of lag time when booting up my PSP from the time that I see the XMB to the time it detects the memory stick.  The process takes ~4 seconds, though this may be a common PSP memory issue and no fault of the adapter (I have no experience with other Duo Pro's other than my 1gb chip).    All in all an excellent way to save [...] bucks over a standard Duo Pro, WITH the option to upgrade later on!

B001AVEJ1Y|4.0|Disclaimer: I come from the \\"old school\\" of Star Trek viewers, having lived long enough to have watched the original run of TOS in its original airing on NBC. I've read many reviews of this movie, some pro, some con, most of the \\"con\\" coming from old-school fans like me, who obviously don't like to see changes in the canon. I finally saw it for myself over Memorial Day weekend.    Without getting into any details that would spoil the plot, I can offer one piece of advice:    This Is Not Your Father's \\"Star Trek\\".    Now, that sounds like a marketing blurb, but it's not. It's a literal description, and a strong plot hint. When you see the movie and get into the plot, you'll understand. This one fact, when I got it through my head, laid any ghost of discontent to rest. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. And I believe that Mr. Roddenberry would have as well. That's as strong a recommendation as I can give. If you're going to the movie, I advise you to put your preconceptions in your back pocket and simply take the movie as it comes. When it's done, and you know the whole plot, then evaluate.    Some observations on the individual characters come to mind. First, as has been observed here, although Captain Kirk was perhaps the \\"icon\\" of TOS, we all know which character was the most influential (we never saw bumper stickers saying \\"I Grok Kirk\\", did we?) -- it was Spock, of course. And the character shines here. Zachary Quinto does a marvelous job of portraying not only the logical Spock in command for the first time, but the human Spock coming to grips with his dual nature.    Chris Pine is a very human Kirk, putting a down-to-earth bit of scuff on the \\"Captain Kirk\\" luster and thereby making him more believable. Pine did his homework, and it shows, not only in the portrayal of the character, but in little things like facial expressions.    Zoe Saldana as Uhura is a treasure. Nichelle Nichols was quite under-used in TOS, to her and her fans' chagrin, but Saldana plays a large part of the plot here (especially one particular part, which I won't dwell on here, but remember --- This Is Not Your Father's \\"Star Trek\\"). And hey --- we get to see her in her underwear. What's not for a Trekfan to like?    The stellar character portrayal, though, is Karl Urban's \\"Bones\\". It's absolutely spooky how well he played this character, making it his own while sometimes seeming almost to channel DeForrest Kelley. It's early McCoy, it's a tribute to Kelley, and it's a joy to watch. (And we find out how he got the nickname \\"Bones\\".)    Much was made before the movie's release about the look of the Enterprise. Yes, I too would probably have been a bit more nostalgic over seeing Roddenberry's original Enterprise, but remember --- This Is Not -- well, I've covered that.    Nothing in life is perfect, and I do have one large gripe with this movie. Not with the plot, the characters, or even the artistic aspects; it's with the photography. Specifically, the action scenes. Maybe it's because I'm 53 years old, wear bifocals, and was not sitting in the back of the theater, but the action shots were so jumpy, blurry, and disjointed that I could not follow anything that was happening in them. In short, the photography sucked. Now, I know that this style is the current fad among cinematographers (witness Battlestar Galactica and any number of small-screen productions that seem to love the \\"un-steady-cam\\" style), but to me this was a major fault in the production and the only thing I found to gripe about. C'mon, guys, all us old fogey Star Trek fans are already losing our vision; don't make it worse with this stuff.    All in all, I give this four-and-a-half stars (only deducting for the above-mentioned rant re photography). While I would not go so far as to call this \\"the best Star Trek movie\\" as some other reviewers here have done, it's definitely deserving of its accolades. When it comes out on home video, it will definitely have a place in my collection.
0765350386|4.0|EDIT (03/16/2014):  Upon re-reading this book (almost 5 years from my first reading), I'm updating my rating just a bit.  I'm now happy with the depth of the characterizations:  the characters now seem properly developed for their roles.  On the other side of the ledger, I still feel that the book is too drawn out and padded.  But, I'm increasing my ratings for the book by 1/2 star to a Very Good 4 stars out of 5.  The rest of my original comments, below, still stand.<br /><br />___ ORIGINAL REVIEW ___<br /><br />\\"The Final Empire\\" is the first book in Brandon Sanderson's \\"Mistborn\\" series (and his second published novel). Similar to the other two of Sanderson's books I've read ([[ASIN:B003G93YLY Elantris]] and [[ASIN:B002KYHZHA Warbreaker (Tor Fantasy)]]), the world, the magic system, and the idea, itself, are amazing. Unfortunately, there's one area where \\"The Final Empire\\" is a bit lacking: the characterizations. The two main characters (Vin and Kelsier) are fairly decently fleshed-out. But, the remaining characters are left almost entirely undeveloped. Also, in the society Sanderson has built, I can't see how ANY of these characters could even exist: with no education or other social support structure, they're ALL, somehow, fully capable of blending in and socializing with the upper crust. This is especially obvious with Vin. She's only in her mid-teens, has specifically received absolutely no education, and has been living as a thief without even parental upbringing (though her brother did try beating some behavior patterns into her) since she was about five. Yet, with a couple of weeks of tutoring, she's able to pass herself off at, essentially, royal balls. Even Henry Higgins required several months to do something similar.  Regardless of the problems with characterizations, I did find the book interesting to read and would have liked to have given it an additional half star. But, Amazon doesn't have that ability. So, I'm rating it an OK 3 stars out of 5.<br/><br />The novels currently in Sanderson's \\"Mistborn\\" series are:<br /><br />1, 2, and 3.  [[ASIN:B004H1TQBW Mistborn Trilogy]] <== Get this omnibus edition -- it's cheaper than the three separate books<br />4.  [[ASIN:B00540QR7Q The Alloy of Law: A Mistborn Novel]]

B001URRXQQ|5.0|This UK special edition CD/DVD set is really worth owning if you're a fan of Ms Carlisle's. It's extremely cheap (at least here in England) and features a 60 minute concert DVD from 1988 which I'd never seen. It's a big fave amongst Belinda's fans, though, and I can see why. She's in great voice throughout and though perhaps it's not the most dynamic looking show ever, Belinda looks great, healthy, trim and really enjoying herself. She's wonderful at hair tossing, too!<br /><br />The album itself is very good and with on-form writers like Diane Warren and Rick Nowels providing a chunk of the material it's commerciality was never going to be in doubt. The album has been remastered, it sounds a little 'warmer', perhaps, but the original sounded pretty good anyway so there was never going to be a massive improvement.<br /><br />The packaging is nice with a (slightly flimsy) 6 panel digipak sleeve and a slim but informative booklet with an essay on Belinda and credits for the CD and DVD. No lyrics, though.<br /><br />So, if you want a fresh look at a late 80's classic, pick up 'Heaven On Earth'. And if you're a Belinda novice, get 'Runaway Horses', HOE's follow up, next. It's by the same team and is very nearly as good.

I'm looking forward to seeing the movie and reading the other books in the series. FYI: My sister says each book is better than the last which is normally unheard of in a series!!
0061655546|5.0|This is a fabulous book. Hands down one of the best I have read in a very long time.    I somewhat remember when the RJR Nabisco takeover went down. I was in college at the time and not nearly as close a follower of business and economic issues as I am today. While many remember the October 1987 stock market collapse as the end of the go-go `80's, I think this deal was really the end of the era.    The book itself recounts the deal itself as well as the history of the players involved. And you deal with a memorable cast of characters. Ross Johnson, the party-hearty CEO who (somewhat unfairly) became the icon of takeover greed due to his actions during the RJR battle. Henry Kravis, the controlled, smart player who ultimately won control of RJR. Peter Cohen, the Shearson Chairman who was so desperate to do a deal and make the big time that he did not know when he was way out of his league. Ted Forstmann, the holier-than-thou dealmaker who got humiliated by his arch-rival Kravis. Jim Maher, the ballsy First Boston merger manager who broke the bidding wide open. The book also tells the story of RJ Reynolds and Nabisco themselves and those are interesting corporate histories.    The story reads like a thriller with every page featuring a new twist or a new knife in the back. And what makes this even better is most readers know the outcome. It is like watching APOLLO 13. You know how it ends and yet you stay with the moment and it is still gripping. The suspense is in the events rather than in the outcome. And it all works  very well.    I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I loved it and recommend it unconditionally.

I called Fox and reported it, but I didn't hear back from Fox.  After three weeks, I called again.  Surprise, surprise - Fox had no record of my call.  Fox asked me to furnish the information again, which I did.  Later that day Fox called me again; once  again, Fox had not correctly taken my information.  This time, Fox wanted  me to send them my copy of Slumdog, and they said that upon receipt of my  copy they would send me the correct Slumdog.  Since Fox could not seem to get my information correct after three tries, I decided to keep the DVD I had, based on the theory that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.  Fox should be ashamed of themselves for not providing better customer  service.  Fox has lost me as a customer, and I have been busy telling people about the extremely poor service from Fox.

B002962RKE|2.0|I love the high school kids, I love the music . . . so much I found my eyes misting up. Ya . . . and I want them to win the Glee Club competition sooooo much.    I've fallen in love . . .     Hey . . . I'm a vet, I love military history, The Alien Trilogy, The Terminator Trilogy and Battlestar Galactica. I want to see the wall pasted with the bad guys.    Can this really be happening . . . :)    Note: At this moment I am pretty disappointed. I cancelled my subscription to Glee . . . the pilot was definitely a 4 star in my book. But the following series went downhill, IMO. The music changed, the plot seemed to get muddled and uninteresting. But especially the music . . . totally different. Mostly an obscure collection of semi-modern lyrical. Just disappointing
B001FB4W0W|2.0|I gave this two stars for the intro song and credits. Great little mini-movie. I really like the books, but this HBO version just changes everything to sleazy, gross, nasty. No likable characters, way too much sex, too little internal consistency in the characters, not much genuine humor. Sookie is almost repugnant, a complete ditz. In the books, she's a very interesting heroine. And why so much time for a character not even in the books, Tara? She's OK, but far too one-dimensional (ie: angry) to carry half the show. Very disappointed.

B001FB4VZS|4.0|***MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD***<br /><br />I thought that this season of SMALLVILLE was one of its best, despite the absence of Michael Rosenbaum as Lex Luthor, who I think, besides Allison Mack and Tom Welling, was a major highlight performer on this show. But they brought in Cassidy Freeman as Tess Mercer, the new boss of Luthorcorp, Sam Witwer as doe-eyed EMT Davis Bloome who unfortunately shares his body with the Kryptonian force of destruction known as Doomsday, and giving Justin Hartley regular screen-time as Oliver Queen aka Green Arrow.<br /><br />While having some great action and acting moments, the series sometimes suffers from the contrived deus ex machina of the conveniently unconscious friend/colleague/love interest whenever Clark needs to use his powers but keep his identity safe. But the worst one of all comes from one of the season's strongest episodes when members of the 31st century's Legion of Superheroes come to Smallville to help Clark out of a jam. They leave with him a Legion ring that will allow him to come forward in time to their century.<br /><br />In the season finale, ***SPOILER*** Lois grabs the ring and is whisked forth in time, and subsequently Jimmy Olsen is fatally wounded by Davis.<br /><br />Hmm... do you think that the show will break continuity with the Superman mythology, or is Lois somehow going to come back and be able to fix this major character's death?<br /><br />I guess we'll have to wait for Season Nine!
B00005Q66Y|5.0|I was listening to this exquisite performance for the first time, laid back on the couch late one evening with the lights out, when it happened.

Better to wait for the Adagio, so every single person in the Philharmonie notices. Here's the perfect moment. Kerb-l-a-a-a-a-a-h!! Hey there, look at me, look at me...

B000YAA68W|5.0|What a fascinating and tragic life Marjane Satrapi has lived. Aesthetically, the film follows the style of her graphic novels (which I haven't read), simple and bold. But the way that it communicates the complexities of emotion, character, and history is truly superb and anything but simple.<br /><br />Satrapi and Parronaud achieve a feat of subtlety in their ability to  portray Marjene's youthfulness without watering down the narrative. The viewer can understand the limited perspective of the main character, while following the developments in Iran that the film tries to explore.<br /><br />The stunning Marjane Satrapi.<br /><br />Something in the film's tone is refreshingly unapologetic-Satrapi pulls no punches when introducing us to the people that have passed through her life in Iran and Europe. She describes her friends in Austria, for example, as having perfected \\"forced nihilism,\\" an obvious term of derision that I found hilarious. The heroes in her young life were communists, but they were her loved ones and composed the largest bloc of opposition to both the Shah and the Ayatollah.<br /><br />The tone of the film could have easily veered toward whiny or preachy because of its subject matter, but  never does. Instead, the viewer inevitably compares the struggles of their own life to the incredible hardships Satrapi has suffered. The result may be uncomfortable, but to some like myself, ultimately inspiring; it adds to our appreciation of art that is truly expressive and the tormented souls behind it that we are privileged to encounter every so often. Persepolis serves to remind us that those who create beauty in this world are often the most haunted among us.

0670020745|2.0|This personal account of a brain scientist having a stroke bristled with promise.  Alas, I found it lacking in many areas.  Not to take anything away from the author, but I feel her editor should have demanded a much better book.  The most compelling part of the book was early on, when Dr. Taylor was having the stroke.  But, in short order, the book lost something.  For me, the author did not do a very good job of describing her recovery.  By that, I mean that she made confusing and contradictory statements.  For example, she described how she could not understand words spoken to her, but then, like a day later, she implies that she COULD understand words.  And her constant refrain of \\"being one with the universe\\" may have been true, but she did not effectively convey to the reader just what that felt like.  Did she feel omniscent?  Did she feel she was part of a global family?  I didn't get it.  And, sadly, I found the last third of the book little more than a patronizing description of New Age gobbledygook.  I'm not questioning her motives, her suffering, her insight or her guts.  I just thought the book could have been much much better.
B001KL3GZO|5.0|I won't comment on the music on this CD as that has been covered so many times before, but the unbelievable accuracy and imaging of this recording spurred me to review the recording/remastering quality.  With eyes closed, you can hear exactly where Miles Davis is sitting as well as every other instrument's location.  I find it nearly impossible to believe that these are recordings from 1959 since the fidelity is so great.  It has been a true pleasure rediscovering this album in such crisp detail.  I do have to pass along a friend's comment, \\"Ahh, there's our old friend --- hiss!\\"  Yes, it's there, but I have to agree with him that it's nice to hear it again after digital recording has nearly eliminated it from contemporary recordings.  Having recently upgraded my stereo, I have been on a CD buying binge, and this is one of my very favorites to play for myself, friends and family.  Two final words: \\"buy it.\\"

B001DJ7PQ4|4.0|This season wraps up as many remaining loose ends, open doors and unresolved plot lines as it was humanly possible to do in 4 seasons.  Only a time lord could have done better.  Donna Noble does takes time to grow into what she would become, but both her development over the course of this season as well as the season finale had me running back through earlier episodes again and again.  Russell Davies is deliberately nurturing the Who fan's compulsive addiction to this immortal series.      Catherine Tate's performance in the final four episodes is so masterful and honest, one forgets that this is a fictional character in a fantasy show: she becomes everywoman dealing with impossible circumstances in one long bolt of lightening revelation.  Tate and Tennant have their own chemistry - no more romance, just friends, thank you - and their ribbing and teasing one another is the perfect antidote to all the unrequited love angst we had to endure in previous seasons. David Tennant seems to effortlessly channel the Doctor now: it will be hard to see him in other roles, although it is obvious that he'll have a long and prolific acting career.    There were few weak episodes: The trick is that each one contains clues to the finale and so should be watched in order.     The first one, \\"Partners in Crimes\\", reminds us of Donna and the Doctor's bond and makes one wonder where this could possible be going, but it was certainly fun.  Planet of the Ood and Pompeii meandered a bit but had their own worthwhile scenes and themes, especially upon second viewing. Planet of the Ood especially gets better after watching season 4 in its entirety.  Then it makes incredible sense.    In the \\"Sontaran Strategem / Poison Sky\\" Martha returns free of her Doctor crush. The  \\"fiance\\" twist, which continued into Torchwood episodes was a bit gratuitous: Dr. Jones had come to stand on her own two feet and was quite competent. The Sontarans are great classic villains and their updated, more compact look, was a nice twist (they were huge when Tom Baker fought them).      \\"The Doctor's Daughter\\" was frustrating. It was as if writer Stephen Greenhorn were trying to create a sequel or new companion, and at the last minute, changed his mind.  It would have been better as a two-parter. It had shades of classic Who with the \\"eternally\\" warring factions that can only find peace through the Doctor's intervention.      \\"The Wasp and the Unicorn\\" was slow until the comedy relief in the resolution scene, when the Doctor and Agatha Christie take turns announcing \\"Whodunit\\" and \\"Whytheydunit' to their captive audience.    The season really hits its stride beginning with the \\"Library/Forest of The Dead\\" two-parter, introducing the unforgettable River Song (what a great name!), sending us along its mad dash to the most over-the-top climax of any Who Season - ever.  And considering Third Season's finale with the Master, that's saying a great deal.    \\"Midnight\\" is sheer brilliance. It hits an unusually creepy and neurotic tone - it's a Twilight Zone episode that Rod Serling would have been proud to claim.  For once, all the Doctor's strengths work to completely undermine him.      \\"Turn Left\\" gives us Catherine Tate in the performance of a lifetime: she chews up scenery, but with heartwrenching emotional clarity. Donna finally has the big lightbulb turn on, and we see the beginning of the end... with another past companion thrown in for good measure. And it only gets bigger and more complicated with the final two episodes.    It would seem that by the time \\"Stolen Planet\\" ends, Davies had created a behemoth of a story so large and complex it threatens to bulge out of control at any moment: some useful detail neglected, some important character or plot twist forgotten. Past companions, Torchwood and Sarah Jane come out in full force:  But no, Davies managed to keep it from plunging into absolute confusion.  There is a pervasive sense that it could all fall apart or some plot device would became so unbelievable or absurd that disbelief could no longer be suspended and the whole story would collapse in on itself.  But miraculously, it doesn't. and you'll be sitting around exhausted, happy and satisfied - mostly - at the Journey's End.    Spoiler Alerts!     The ending is heartbreaking, although Dalek Caan's prophecy proved to be misleading... no one literally ---s.    Serious complaint:  Why wasn't a TARDIS crystal left in the parallel Universe with the clone and ----?      Huge plot hole:  If ------- itself is to be destroyed, how could the -----s and -----s possibly survive it?  Or did they have a suicide pact?
1416575464|5.0|I own hundreds of interior design and decor books and if I could only keep 5 of them, this would be one of the top 5 interior decoration books.  Why?    It's thoroughly up-to-date with styles which will inspire and stretch you, while retaining some classic styles.  It's a great how-to book.  It shows you how to put rooms together with different elements.  The rooms are original and captivating.  It has a \\"little black book\\" at the end of places to buy the design elements in person or online with a review of each and its price scale.  It's just a fun, cheeky book that is well-designed and entertaining to look at and read. It continually surprises and enchants.  I use this book in a design course I teach and the class loves it. Even if you like traditional decor, this book will inspire you to keep it fresh by incorporating something surprising or unusual just so the room doesn't look like every other traditionally designed room.    I just wish Domino magazine hadn't gone out of business, and like Victoria magazine, will be revived when the recession is over and we're all buying back copies of domino magazine on Ebay....    Until then, at least we've got this domino book with which to comfort ourselves!
B0019M2ITY|3.0|I have no idea why this watch is being categorized as a toy.  However,it is pretty enough, and performs its function of keeping time very well.  A bit gaudy, but you can easily dress an outfit up or down with this accessory.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|What a great story of how dire circumstances effect the lives of people in different ways. Dickens has a wonderful way of weaving characters of different backgrounds and social status into a tapestry that eventually makes a complete picture. I always like his endings of good eventually triumphing over evil but not before some interesting road blocks, twists and turns. As always in BBC productions -- excellent casting.
B000E41MS6|5.0|As so many others have written, this Sci-fi classic will be around for years.  Chris Eccleston was brilliant as the Ninth Doctor and is sorely missed.  He set the standard that David Tennant and following Doctors have to live up to.  Not only does Eccleston bring dark conviction, pain and vulnerability to his performance of the Doctor, he leads you through the maze that is the Whoniverse with an offbeat humor and manic intensity.  He will remain my favorite Doctor (behind Tom Baker).      Billie Piper is terrific as Rose, and along with Noel Clark, brings the uncertainty and apathy of the youth of London's working class to light.    My one minor creepout is that the writing/production team of Russell T. Davies and Julie Gardner are intent on gaining female viewership by building up an awkward romance between Rose and the Doctor. Since they play it out innocently enough, it's not a huge thing.  And the later incarnation of Tennant's Doctor is even more charming and younger-appearing than Eccleston. But it's just a matter of time before things have to change.  As a longtime Who fan I've seen William Hartnell, Patrick Troughton, and Sylvester McCoy (the \\"geezer\\" incarnations) take on this role, so the relationship between an ever-changing 900 year old alien with a 19 year old human girl is bound to take a weird detour that Rose may hesitate to follow, once the Doctor isn't quite so cool or adorable in appearance.      But I am certain Davies can handle even that turn of events.  The writing for each episode is packed full of imagination and biting social commentary about our times (especially pointed while living through the policies of George W. Bush's administration and The War on Terror) with its increased militarism, paranoia and ambiguous fears.  The Doctor assures us we're going to be okay, but not without a fight.  And there are constant battles with ordinary folk learning that they will have to engage the powers that be in order to change their world.      Somestandouts in the series:  Eccleston's brash performance in \\"Aliens of London\\" contains his delivery of one of the funniest lines in Who History.    \\"Dalek\\" sees the return of our favorite villains - essential to the Whoniverse and the Doctor's identity. Rose must take a stand that changes the Doctor for the better.    \\"The Long Game\\" shows what happens when people are seduced into perpetuating their own backwards state of affairs. The \\"media\\" in this new world is the key to their problems and solution.     \\"The Empty Child\\" and \\"The Doctor Dances\\" introduces the controversial but charming character Jack Harkness (eventually we grow to like him). And writer Steven Moffat (Coupling) produces one of the best stories of the entire 4 seasons with this two parter.  Powerful, unforgettable writing and quotes that even David Tennant has to recall in later seasons.    \\"Bad Wolf\\" and \\"Parting of the Ways\\"  reaffirms everything we love about this Doctor and makes our parting with him even more difficult in retrospect.  And Rose is forever changed once she sees that it's up to her (With help from Mickey and Jackie) to ensure that destruction and chaos are turned away. These last two episodes ultimately show what potential we humans possess when tested.    This season is a standalone classic. It works because the true heroes are those who allow their lives to change once they've encountered the Doctor: they stop accepting their place on the sidelines, stand up in the face of overwhelming odds and do something about the mess they are in.     Watch it! Laugh and Learn and save the world!
B00004YX39|5.0|When it comes to Steely Dan -- from their first album to the last -- there are no disappointments. Their impeccable, absurdly complex style sums up an era like few bands have ever been able to accomplish. I was way too young, and sadly oblivious, to appreciate the vast musical wealth of the 70s, but put on a Steely Dan album, and I'm instantly transported to the Hollywood Hills with a cocktail (or something much stronger) in hand, looking down on the Chateau Marmont and the hazy, seedy under-belly of Sunset Boulevard. With a coy wink and an subtle smurk, their music always hints of an insider's perspective that only those who have lived and partied too hard can appreciate. Case in point, in their own words, in 'The Caves of Altamira (not on the Gaucho album, but The Royal Scam):<br /><br />\\"Before the fall when they wrote it on the wall<br />When there wasn't even any Hollywood<br />They heard the call<br />And they wrote it on the wall<br />For you and me we understood.\\"<br /><br />Jaded? yes. Decadent? yes. And strangely, it's those qualities and others that make this group and their work, dare I say, endearing. So whatever term can be pinned to them, one thing is certain: Long may Steely Dan reign.
0312305060|5.0|I had several reasons to read this book. First, \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" is one of my favorite books and the film adaptation of \\"The Hours\\" is one of my favorite movies. So, I was prepared for something profound, but I was not expecting a book that would speak to me the way this one did. Michael Cunningham has a way of describing his characters' thoughts and feelings that makes me feel like he's inside my own mind. The fears, sensations, and oddities of Virginia, Laura, and Clarissa are so much like my own and it forced private feelings that I have never really acknowledged to come to the surface. Reading this book was a a very personal experience for me, but I believe that any reader will be able to enjoy it. Cunningham explores an incredible variety of emotions and demonstrates a unique understanding of human nature. I would recommend this book to pretty much everyone I know.
1595141715|4.0|When I look for a new book to read some of the things I look for are if one of my friend or someone has recommended it to me.. I also look for things that are of a different point of view of something I've read. The last thing I look for is if I think it will be interesting from reading a summary of it. A few of my friends told me that 13 Reasons Why was a really good book. So I looked it up and seen that it was about a girl who committed suicide and was telling her story through tapes. It sounded really interesting. I also liked it because I haven't read any books that give you both point of views. I would recommend this to high school students because I think the material is too much for younger kids. One thing I would change about this book is the transition between the girl on the tapes and the person listening because it did get a bit confusing at times. I really enjoyed this book.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|I was hesitant to purchase this movie online, at first . But I am so glad I did! Not only was the DVD in perfect condition when I got it but it came in 2 business days.

0375842209|4.0|When I look for a new book to read some of the things I look for are who wrote it and if I've read something from that author, and liked it. I also look for things that are of a different point of view of something I've read. The last thing I look for is if I think it will be interesting from reading a summary of it. The Book Thief covered all of these characteristics. I've read The Messenger by Markus Zusak. I really liked his way of writing. This book was about the Holocaust but it wasn't necessary about people in the Holocaust. It was about a family who lived during the Holocaust and hid a German. I've never read a book like that even though I've read a few books on the Holocaust. My last thing I look for is the summary and this one sounded really interesting. The whole concept of the story being told by death really grabbed my attention. I think this book is best for teens in high school. I wouldn't recommend this for younger kids because some of the things that happen aren't suitable for younger children. Something I would add to this book would be a glossary, because even though they say what the German words mean they only say it once and the words come up again. I do really think this book is a good book.
B001ILHY1I|3.0|DEATH RACE    This is for those who don't know another remake that was put out there, but unlike most I was actually excited about this one. I knew that this was one that needs the brain shut off and that really won't have character development, but that is ok. The thing that I was happy about is that the original films legendary producer Roger Corman returns as a producer on this film, that's enough for me. I know some people were worried because Paul W.S. Anderson is the writer/director of this film, but he is an action director and on that level he succeeds. Still this is a remake and with that there will always be disappointments, when watching this I felt like they missed a lot of opportunities. By that I mean this could have been a mindless, fun, and wonderfully violent EPIC film, instead it is the first three and just a decent flick.     After 2008 the economy started to fall through [yikes that is kinda happening] and the crime rate rises while every one losses their jobs. This sets things up for prisons to be very corrupt and very full, makes things interesting. At one prison in particular the warden has a little reality show on the internet called \\"DEATH RACE\\". An event that pits inmate against inmate in a race to the finish line, the only problem is you may be finished before you get there. Why do the inmates agree to do it you ask, well because if the win 5 times [I think is the number] you win your freedom. Yeah that sounds great for the population a crazy prisoner gets released from jail into the public after killing other prisoners live on a show, break out the welcome wagon.    It seems a racer named Frankenstein [David Carradine from the original for a quick cameo] is killed right before he wins his freedom, seems he was the fan favorite and Warden Hennessey needs him back in the races. So she sends out a prisoner to frame a famous former race car driver named Jensen Ames, it looks like he killed his wife so he goes to jail only to become the new Frankenstein. Of course he doesn't want to but he needs to be freed to see his daughter, so at least that much makes sense. So we are off to the races I guess to a fun filled violent experience to see who will win it, I mean it will be a close race. Jason Statham has driven many a fast car and Tyrese was \\"2 Fast 2 Furious\\" so it should be close.    This film is far from the original mainly because the first film is such a classic amongst the Corman fans like myself, but to be honest this is a new film for a new day and Roger did sign off on it. I find this film to be a really good buddy film, and I don't mean like a buddy cop movie or anything like that. I mean this film is best viewed eating and drinking with your friends; you can all get just as loud as the film and have a mindless good time. My brother, my girl, and a few others all enjoyed this and I think it was because of the atmosphere, good times had by all. Don't get me wrong you can enjoy this at any time but that is best way to watch this type of film I believe.    As far as the direction it is pretty straightforward, it is all centered around the action and that is fine since it doesn't try to be anything else. Anderson does a good job here as far as that aspect is concerned but don't expect a lot of character development. The deaths are really cool at least in my opinion even if there some over the top moments, but with a title like Death Race what do you expect. The cars are fun and match the atmosphere and look of the film and the action is solid, also The Dreadnought is a cool killing machine but it comes and goes to quick I think. Jason Statham is excellent in the lead role and really I felt he was the best guy for this type of flick. Tyrese though is another story because I just didn't see him in this, he did a great job with his character and maybe because of the lack of script he just seemed, I don't know. Joan Allen on the other hand I felt was great in this and made for a believable villain, I wanted to say something else. Natalie Martinez is decent in this and Ian McShane as Coach is very good in this as well.    To me this was a fun film although far from a classic it is still good enough in my opinion for a rental at least. I bought it as to continue owning all things Corman, don't have everything yet but I will get there eventually. Like I said before order some pizza crack open a few drinks [whatever you sip on] and watch this with you friends. It is a good time if you turn off the brain; at least I had fun with it.

0439023483|4.0|Once a year, the Capitol choses two youthes from each of its twelve districts to participate in the Hunger Games, a televised fight to the death. When her sister is selected, Kantiss volunteers herself and so begins a journey to the Capitol and to the arena where she must use all of her skills--and perhaps sacrifice her morality--in order to survive. Something of a flashy Battle Royale, The Hunger Games is compulsively readable and yet, filled with moral quandaries, unexpectedly intelligent. Unfortunately, its televised gloss and forced romance drag it down. While the book could be better, on the whole I enjoyed and recommend it.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a distinct case of \\"so good, and yet...\\" and as such, it's difficult to review. I take issue with some aspects of the text, yet on the whole I liked it and I don't want my grievances to overwhelm that fact. It is a compelling book: vivid, immediate, vicariously thrilling and violent, yet wrapped in tangled moral quandaries. Stranded in the wild, Kantiss's survival in nature is compelling enough, detailed with descriptions of dehydration and food gathering to make the reader acutely thankful for grocery stores. But worse, she's shoved into a life or death situation where she has ever right to kill in self-defense--yet most of her would-be murderers are in the exact same position. This quandary is sometimes solved by a convenient deus ex machina, but Collins often meets the tangled moral situation head on--which is remarkably discomforting and brave. The Hunger Games is always a compulsively readable page-turner, but it is sometimes remarkably intelligent as well, and that's a brilliant and satisfying combination.<br /><br />And yet. For all that I enjoyed the book, my pleasure was tainted by niggling annoyances. The Hunger Games are a national event, wrapped in glitzy ceremonies, controlled by Gamemakers, televised for the Capitol and districts to see. All of that flash and outside influence opens the door to unnecessary complication: spontaneous forest fires, gifts parachuting from the sky, and constant playing to the camera, all of which detract from the story's authenticity, some of which open the door to unwelcome deus ex machinas. Worst of all, it leads to a staged romance which is unbelievable, unnecessary, and messy. The story would have been better preserved without the complications of romance, least of all a faux romance. (It gets worse: in playing up this faux romance, Kantiss finds strength not in her quick mind or survival skills, but in her ability to act like a lovestruck girlfriend. Would that her survival didn't rely on acting weak and foolishly dedicated to a male character.) So the glitz and tacked on love story sour the book, but The Hunger Games is nonetheless riveting and surprisingly intelligent, a compelling and swift read. It could be better, and I don't think I'll pick up the sequel (I rarely do), but I recommend this installment.ication: spontaneous forest fires, gifts parachuting from the sky, and constant playing to the camera, all of which detract from the story's authenticity, some of which open the door to unwelcome deus ex machinas.

B001DU8T6I|5.0|I haven't bought the product, but I have heard all of the songs on it. I love each one. Some are better than others as in every album, but an overall good buy. Demi provides good clean songs with a range of pitches. Some are good if you just want to relax, others are for having a good time. I really enjoy her voice and I can't wait to hear future albums from her.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Awesome production of an equally awesome story.  Excerpts should be used as an adjunct to all high school American History and World History curriculums.  Highly recommend this for all high school students and their families.  Content and language may be a little too much for younger children.  Our younger generations need to know that their FREEDOM HAS BEEN SECURED BY THE SACRIFICE OF OTHERS so they will cherish and protect that freedom for the generatios to come.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I've done nothing but watch the director's cut of The Motion Picture on DVD... Last night I just watched the Blu-ray version. The picture is just absolutely amazing and I didn't notice any content missing, it's exactly as I remember it from the DVD version... Maybe my memory is shot, doubt it. There are plenty of extras, I'm sure not every one in existence, but plenty. The picture is so great, like many Blu-rays, you can see the glitches where they super-imposed the Enterprise on the space background. Granted, they could've included an option to watch the director's cut, but, hey, this is the original Star Trek movie series. These will be great no matter what version.<br /><br />I have now watched up through the entire set, and still the picture is perfect, still no complaints, AT ALL!!! Not sure why people are complaining about the picture, maybe their TV is a poor HDTV as is their Blu-Ray player? I can see EVERY hair out of place on every character, that's how crystal clear my picture is and my TV was just some cheap one I got at Wal-Mart, as is my Blu-Ray player. Once again, still no complaints.
B002AR9YPI|5.0|I would compare this album to Radiohead's In Rainbows in that its a towering example of a band at the top of its creative ability gelling together to create one cohesive vision. Whats amazing to me is that this is only Grizzly Bear's 2nd full-on album.     To me, this record has that intangible 'it' quality that you cant put your finger on what makes it so appealing, but its what keeps pulling you back listen after listen.     Describing the sound on this album is a bit difficult, but I would call it a rustic, ethreal, pop-folk. But I believe that the enjoyment comes not from whatever genre you want to call it, but at appreciating the meticulous song craft that creates what is, for me, the most memorable album in years.     Sorry Animal Collective, I love you guys and your new album is great, but you just got beat out for album of the year. Highest Recommendation.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I  highly  recommend  this  product  to  any  Supernatural  fan.  The  third  season  continues  quality  and  plot  of  first  two  seasons.

B001P9KR8U|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatre and was completely absorbed by it.  The story, the cinematography, and the glimpse into the way other people's lives are shaped was truly unforgettable.  Not a movie to watch repeatedly, but certainly one to be enjoyed on special occasions.
0575082372|4.0|I have read every Alastair Reyonlds book.  He captured me with the original Revelation Space, and I have been hoping (for his sake as much as mine!) that he comes around with another winner on that level.  While House of Suns is a much better book than his last few, is it also quite different from his usual style.    First the good...we have a far-reaching, mind-bending story that spans millions of years and crosses more than one galaxy.  It is a definite page turner and a great mystery.  The post-human characterizations are very well done and combine to give you that sense of ultimate time.  The interweaved story of Palatial is an interesting twist, very un-Reynolds like, but holds your interest to the (near) end.  The ending is actually quite good although stops VERY abruptly, as in you can't believe the last sentence is really the last sentence.  Perhaps he is leaving us hanging for a sequel?    Now the bad...it is definitely missing some of the thrilling noir that he is known for.  It is actually quite an optimistic novel, with relatively benign characters, not like what I expect from Reynolds.  The love story, frankly, was not all that convincing and it is supposed to be a huge part of the novel, so really does not satisfy on that level.  Also, the interweaved story of Palatial is ultimately pointless.  I really expected some kind of epiphany after reading all that.  I am still wondering why it takes such an important role in the book.  I mean there are tidbits that I thought I was going to connect, but ultimately it made no sense to the bigger picture (if it made sense to others, please comment and tell me why you think so!).  I also thought it was very strange how he alternated between a different point of view each chapter.  It was very distracting.  Finally, this book is a lot more fantasy than pure hard science fiction.  I just wish it was more \\"believeable\\".  I guess the fact that it takes place millions of years in the future allows him to bypass that aspect (with the one big exception being his faster-than-light limitation).    Still, I give it 4 stars.  A worthy read.  I would not spend the money to buy a hardcover, though.  Buy it in paperback or rent it from the library.
0385736002|4.0|After the ending of the wonderful Harry Potter series, I was looking for another series to get into, and I found this one quite by accident. While looking on Amazon.com for a copy of God Emperor of Dune, I found a link to this book. After reading the sample chapter on this site, I was hooked and wanted to learn more about this tale. From the beginning, this book really sucks you into its world, where you as a reader meet many of the people and creatures that we've all read about in mythology in a fun and delightful way. Before learning that there were six planned novels in this series, the first book really leaves you with that cliffhanger feeling. You care and WANT to know what happens to these characters. If you are looking to get into a really good series of books, I recommend it. I certainly can't wait to see what happens next.
0307346617|5.0|I raced through this book. It was an absolute page turner. Afterwards there were really only minor things I wanted different with the book.    Highs:   the Great Panic - how everyone collectively went 'oh ****' when the first military response failed  North Korea just shutting itself in, seems like an incredibly realistic response from them  the dogs' usefulness  the rogue sub  the battle of New Hope  european castles    Lows:   ocean floor zombies... c'mon I know we're suspending reality here, but if a 5.56mm bullet can explode their skulls, how are their heads not imploding on the ocean floor?   japan... all the japan stories just didn't seem to fit for me  taking back the usa... like i said, great account of the first new battle against the zombies. then tiny mentions of chicago, omaha, etc... i really wanted more.  wanted alot more recounts from safe zone/castle survivors and holdouts
0439023483|1.0|I'm pretty certain I read this before when it was called Battle Royale by Koushun Takami, or was it The Long Walk by Richard Bachman (Stephen King)? Either way, it is a complete and total rip off of both of these far superior novels. It's such a shame that this novel is being hailed as an original story when in fact it is total plagiarism. Read the titles above, they are better written, contain more compelling characters and are not cheesy teen pseudo-romances. It pains me to read all the positive reviews when clearly this book steals all of its central ideas without injecting anything new to the mix!
0451169514|2.0|I just finished reading IT last night.  These are my thoughts:    I loved reading about the children and their relationships.  The novel had a feeling of nostalgia and a coming of age aspect to it.  I enjoyed being privy to the thoughts of the individual children.  I enjoyed their ideas and conversations and emotions.  This was all good.  Good characterization!     The novel had a few scary parts.  I was most chilled over the mystery of the missing children at first.  The individual cases described.  Some of the sightings of IT. The voices in the drain.  The abusive father of Bev's and the bullies. The creepy kid with the fridge.  This got me page turning!    Then there were ridiculous parts that were ment to be scary.  Teenage werewolves, vampires, lake monsters, a giant bird . . . I tried to go with the flow at these parts.      Then came the end.  The end was terrible!  I don't know if I get it.  Spider?  Deadlights?  Chud?  Turtle?  Orgy?  What?    Well, I get it . . . but I don't like it!    This book could have been SO much better.  Maybe if IT was more real?  Maybe not a human serial killer, but not a demi-god or whatever she was. She could have been a ghost-like entity, a lingering evil, or a force that caused others to go crazy (like she did to Henry) . . . Something like that . . . Just not some product of the universe that feeds on children because they're easy to scare!  The ending was just so out there.  So removed from reality.  So ridiculous!    Honestly, I did enjoy reading this book.  I'm glad I did. I never got bored reading it. I just can't justify giving it more than two stars . . . because of the length . . . because of the ending . . . because of the complete ridiculous aspects.
1592332803|5.0|This book is awesome!      I've only made 2 things so far, the Bran Muffins & the Mediterranean Olive Bread.  Both are FANTASTIC!      So many things to bake, so little time!    I'm VERY excited about the chocolate cheesecake recipe as it utilizes vegan cream cheese I can buy at the store.  I had been looking for a tofu free cheesecake recipe so this looks amazing!  My omni mother-in-law bakes a chocolate cheesecake that she has been baking for years and years so I'd love to be able to veganize it :)  and have somethign to eat that doesn't make my stomach hurt :)      This cookbook is awesome - buy it today!
B001TIDXTM|3.0|As a 64 year old grandmother, I found this book a little disturbing for a younger teenager. I cautioned my daughter about letting my 12 year old granddaughter read it. Not that anything explicit was revealed, but just the suggestions of their 1st sex encounter after marriage and the black and blue marks and soreness Bella had, might not be understood by some younger children. Or the part where she should walk out naked or put a towel around her. The broken furniture in the bedroom.      Then Bella was pregnant, it was not a pleasant experience and childbirth was horrific for her. Very detailed description of how Bella's \\"monster baby\\" was abusing her. Another thing that might upset someone younger.     The anguish Bella went through was detailed when she was turned a vampire, might cause nightmares in some children. I know my granddaughter would have them.    I enjoyed the series, but found this last book a little dark and disturbing for a younger teenager. It will be interesting to see how they make the movie for this book without it being rated R if they stick to the book.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|I will leave the plot line to others who write those well. You know when someone who knows you're going through something asks you about it and you can't come up with a quick reply and finally just throw your hands up in the air and state...it's just too complicated to go into.  That is exactly how I felt after watching this movie. The multi-levels of feelings, reactions, analyses are still with me having watching The Reader a couple of hours ago.<br /><br />I teach about the Holocaust....I lost many relatives in the Holocaust. I never once had the thought that this was glorifying those who participated in the Holocaust. This is a character study of a woman who, on many levels, knew what she'd been involved in.  It is not a romantization ofthat involvement. On the contrary, it lays bare those complicit in the crimes of killing of innocents. Winslet's amazing and multi-layered portrayal of a woman did remind me of Streep in Sophie's Choice in that she was desperate to cling onto life while at the same time flinging it away from her. Her knowledge of her past actions is sublimely subtle.<br /><br />The young lawyer has to grapple with the crimes of his ancestors and indeed, that is Germany today. Fiennes has monumental decisions to make about his relationship with Winslet's character and I felt his burden more than once.<br /><br />I plan on getting the movie as part of my Holocaust library.  Whether or not I will be able to watch it again is up-for-grabs. I usually refer to this kind of movie as \\"a lot of work\\"...emotionally, mentally...but I have a feeling there is more to be seen that I missed the first time through.  If you like movies that make you think, deeply, emotionally....and that stay with you, then you should see this movie.
0140274111|4.0|A young lady's hectic life in New York in the 1940's.  A beautiful, unpredictable 19 year-old living life to the fullest, from one party to the next, breaking hearts here & there, in short, quite a tease.  A strong character indeed, with a hidden fragility coming from an obscure past, a past that she does not want to share with anyone.  Meet Holly Golightly, Travelling.  She is here depicted by one of her previous neighbours, a young writer with whom she shared quite a few adventures and a strong bond. Holly doesn't seem to have peace, she is forever on her way out, dazzling, attractive.  A young woman of the world, well known by New York socialites and not only.  Some of her connections are questionable and will they get her into trouble?  That is for you to find out.<br /><br />I loved the narrative.  My first book by Truman Capote, better late than never (I had seen the film but could not remember it) and a real discovery.  Simple, elegant, to the point, funny and sad simultaneously, conveying Holly's character in a perfect way.  I was expecting a heart-breaking love story but this was not it.  It was more than that.  Strong, fragile Holly (probably still travelling) is a very likeable personage.  The other characters including the narrator, mostly in the background, also find a perfect niche to complement the novel.<br /><br />It was an interesting choice by the author that she was depicted in an era when most ladies' place was at home.  Independent, not caring a bit about being \\"judged\\".  Looking for love?  Looking for \\"something\\"?  Is that why she is forever running around?  Well, as long as she can relax with breakfast at Tiffany's, all is ok.<br /><br />Read this book, a few delightful pages (it's very short) that will leave you hanging in there for an answer.
B0015OKWL2|5.0|Pacino and De Niro together again. This movie had a twist you just didn't see till the end. Great writing and perfect cast. These two together are fantastic. Definitely a must see.
044024367X|3.0|Not his best, possibly his worst but I still give it 3+ stars for the sheer artifice.  Reacher commutes between Hope and Despair as Nothing happens.  Huge amounts of filler are needed; lots of time in a coffee shop, strange but dull women, bar fights, portent with little outcome, descriptions of rocks, mysterious military stuff, mystery bodies, internal dialogue galore.....    Childs pulls out all the tricks to cover a non plot and mediocre characters and, given the standards of the genre, succeeds.  Even if you don't like the plot and action you must admire a craftsman at work.    Hope this is not his \\"Jump the Shark\\" effort.
B000P0J0AG|5.0|Loved the cast. Another De Niro movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Action, suspense a little romance and lots of action. A definite A+ Movie.
0316035904|4.0|I love David Sedaris. I love his writing - it's witty and amazingly observant. His commentary on daily life is brilliant and I'm quite certain that if we met in real life, we'd be best friends. It was because of this that I was interested in finally, after all these years, reading his Christmas collection Holidays on Ice. Sadly, in the end, I'm very torn with the book.     Some essays are hilarious, like \\"SantaLand Diaries\\" and \\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore.\\" They share memories from his past Christmases worth mentioning (working as one of Santa's Elves at Macy's, having a prostitute join his family for Christmas). Some were published in other books of his, so I've already read them, such as \\"Let it Snow\\" and \\"Six to Eight Black Men\\" (which are both terrific, nonetheless). And then some (three to be exact) I really didn't care for. They were okay, sure, but not written in his usual style. Rather than being first person narratives, he assumed the role of someone else and wrote their story (a angered wife, a rich competitive man, a TV executive) I didn't care for those stories and found myself skimming the pages rather than indulging. When it got back to his voice, I was comfortable again.     The book didn't exactly get me into the holidays spirit, but it did bring out the jaded side of me. And that's just as good, right?
1401322425|5.0|I love the show and was delighted to find the book.  There are sections that highlight the garden and how to grow vegetables that are used in the recipes.  I think he is an engaging writer and this book was everything I hoped it would be.
1905654294|4.0|For starters, I admit that at the age of 24 I still enjoy young adult literature. There's something about the Twilight Series, by Stephenie Meyer, that's ridiculously addictive. The plot is enticing, the characters are so well drawn out that they become friends, and the overall books are satisfying. With that being said, the last book in the series, Breaking Dawn, is a bit underwhelming.    Eclipse, the third book in the series, leaves off with Bella's ultimate choice. After almost being murdered by a gang of young and angry vampires, she finally chooses that her love for Edward, her vampire boyfriend, is stronger than her friendship with (and possible love for) Jacob, her werewolf best friend. With that, she rejects Jacob and agrees to marry Edward. Breaking Dawn starts on a hopeful, gentile, and happy note: preparations for the wedding and honeymoon. There, Bella will, as planned, finally join her future husband in a life of bloodlust as a vampire.     Naturally, there are some complications. These early set complications, along with previously noted problems, all culminate to lead up to the climax 700 pages later.     In my opinion, the problems with the book start with the voice. Between Eclipse and Breaking Dawn, Meyer penned a book out of the series entitled, The Host. Although the characters in The Host sound exactly like those characters we've grown to love in the Twilight Series, some of her writing style changed and with that, left Breaking Dawn different. She lost some of her characters, giving them new personalities and new motivations. Jasper becomes friendly and winks at Bella. Rosalie becomes angrier than normal. Also, what's with the nicknames? Since when was Jasper \\"Jazz\\" and Emmet \\"Em\\"?    A third of the way through the book she changes voices completely. Rather than having Bella narrate the middle chapters, she has Jacob. The reason is unknown. After three books of learning, accepting, and loving Bella's narrative, this new voice is different andirritating. Important at times, definitely, but there could have been ways to explain what happened without changing the voice. And most importantly, it's not very masculine. Meyer tries too hard to make him sound like a teenage boy, which results in dialogue even movies wont use. Thankfully, the narration is changed back to Bella's at a very crucial part.    The book centers around the idea of forever. Marriage binds a couple until death, but a vampire marriage couples a pair forever. Meyer reminds us of this very few pages, overusing the word \\"forever\\" much like she overused the word \\"dazzled\\" in the first book, being somewhat of a female Palahniuk.    I think the biggest problem Meyer faced, however, were her fans. It's not unknown that these books have created quite a following. With millions of fans aching to read the last book, message boards were filled with predictions, hopes, and fears. Wanting to suffice every fan, Meyer created a plot that lacked the passion she originally had in the series. Wanting to appease the fans, she lost many.      The plot itself was endearing at times, yet ridiculously over the top at others. My wildest prediction was proved to be true, something I truly hoped would not happen. Sure, a story of a vampire, human, werewolf love triangle is a bit out of the ordinary, but that's acceptable compared to what she proposes in the book.     Complaints aside, the book was decent. Not nearly as satisfying or complete as the others, yet still good and still very enjoyable. It had moments where I couldn't put the book down, moments that I reenacted in my head while at work. Moments that made me smile because it reminded me WHY I loved the series so much. With liking the characters as much as I do, I wanted to keep reading. I wanted to love it. And because of that, I did enjoy it. I did like how it ended, a happy ending, as she promised, and I liked what happened with each character. It was a solid ending to the series.    Who knows if the further books she plans on making (an encyclopedia, much like J.K. Rowling; Midnight Sun, the story from Edward's perspective; and the possible three additional books detailing life after the series, as told by other characters) will help the series or destroy it. Is she jumping the shark? Who knows. One thing I do know is that Meyer does have talent. She knows how to keep a reader interested. She knows how to create a world wide phenomenon and she knows how to make girls drool over characters too dreamy to be human. For all of this, I have a lot of respect for her. And, ultimately, for all this, I'll still have a very high regard for the series. Maybe not for forever, but at least for quite some time.
B00009P1O2|5.0|Freddie Mercury is hands down one of the best showmen that rock and roll has ever seen and this DVD showcases him at the top of his game.  It is well filmed, sounds amazing, with all the hits that you know and love, performed flawlessly.    I think every wannabe rock star should see this movie to learn what real performance is.  This band puts 99% of modern acts to shame.  Not only is their musicianship and performance top notch here, the interaction with the audience, as large as it is, is phenomenal!  You can see how every person, even those on the farthest row, were affected.

B001PJRAUS|5.0|Imagine entering the pages of your favorite book, walking with and speaking with literary characters you know so well, then finding the story moving in new directions because you are there. That is exactly what happens to Amanda when she finds herself in Jane Austen's Pride And Predjudice. Amada continues to push the characters in the direction she knows they should be going, but alas, it isn't working. And that is the fun of the film.    Originally aired as a four-part series on BBC, the DVD combines all four parts into a very decent film. I did not see the original four parts, I cannot tell you if anything was cut, I can only say I found the film neither too long nor too short. I did find it very entertaining.    I would say the film would be better enjoyed if you have watched the excellent Colin Firth version within the last year or so. Or be very familiar with the tale. Those not familiar with the story - and there must be a few - should aquaint themselves with the story before watching this film. Otherwise, they miss the fun. Austen fans should love it.

B0009UC7H0|4.0|My first comment is, don't try to take this film too seriously! Sahara is one of those misunderstood, underrated movie in recent years. I found it to be (mostly) lighthearted, campy, fun, and even a little bit dumb ...and reminiscent of the original Indiana Jones (Lost Ark, not the other three).<br /><br />It got awful ratings by critics (38% on Rotten Tomatoes), and I think many people were expecting another National Treasure. I'm not sure why they drew the comparison - just because they came out at the same time? But I actually enjoyed this more than National Treasure (and even more than Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skulls), simply because it didn't take itself too seriously.<br /><br />The film did tip it's hat to a few serious social issues (some of the corruption in African governments, lack of humanitarian aid, and most importantly, the corporations trying to corner the natural resources markets). But mostly, this was lighthearted and fun - windsurfing through the desert, diving, flying, racing, chasing, etc.<br /><br />And the casting was simply perfect. Frankly, I'm not a huge fan of Matthew McConaughey, but he was perfect for this role. Steve Zahn added a LOT to this film as the sidekick, Pen&eacute;lope Cruz and Delroy Lindo were wonderful, and William H. Macy was brilliant.<br /><br />I frankly was expecting something like Blood Diamonds (an excellent, excelling film) or National Treasure. Instead I was pleasantly surprised - I found it to be a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />Yes the villains were a bit over-the-top. The plot was a bit absurd but straightforward nonetheless (I simply cannot understand people who were confused by this, or said there were too many twists and turns) - it's a simple adventure movie that made me smile.<br /><br />I'm usually not into pop/pulp fiction novels, but seeing the movie actually made me pick up some Clive Cussler novels. I hope they make more of these films!
B0015FML06|4.0|What could be better than U2 from 1983 in concert? They were at their early peak and touring the U.S. \\"Under a Blood Red Sky\\" epitomizes that.  The CD/DVD version a great buy because you get the best of both worlds.  The CD does leave you wanting more songs other than the eight because eight songs don't quite do \\"Blood Red Sky\\" justice.  The booklet with pictures is a great added bonus.
B00024I0OC|4.0|This remastered 2-disc set by Sanctuary includes the excellent Valentyne Suite (1969) (Disc 1) and the US release of the album The Grass is Greener (1970) (Disc 2).  This set is not too shabby and features good sound quality, liner notes that may be of interest to folks not familiar with the group, and tiny photos of the group.<br /><br />Valentyne Suite (****½)<br /><br />This 1969 release presents a very exciting mixture of classical, heavy British blues rock, jazz and psychedelic rock, and demonstrates how the psychedelic groups were becoming more sophisticated, especially in terms of the level of musicianship.  Unfortunately, this album and group seem to have fallen through the cracks, which is too bad - this is a pretty good example of the proto-progressive style and its influences turn up on some of the debut albums by the English progressive acts.<br /><br />The lineup includes bandleader and virtuoso drummer/percussionist Jon Hiseman, Tony Reeves (bass guitar), Dave Greenslade (organ, vibes), Dick Heckstall-Smith (saxophones), and James Litherland (electric guitar, lead vocals).  While some of the psychedelic outfits active at the time had great drummers, Jon Hiseman really raised the bar.  Dave Greenslade was no slouch either and his organ playing is impressive throughout.  Lastly, Dick Heckstall-Smith was a very jazzy player and borrowed the technique of playing two saxophones at once from jazzer Rahsaan Roland Kirk.<br /><br />The album is split between four shorter tracks and the lengthy Valentyne Suite (it clocks in at a little over 16 minutes).  While I enjoy the shorter tracks, which blend aspects of heavy British blues rock, jazz, and psychedelic rock together, it is the three part suite that really holds my interest.  The suite is actually pretty cohesive and my favorite parts include the haunting, classically influenced passages, which feature some great Hammond organ work by Dave Greenslade.  He really used the organ to its fullest extent on the suite and could make it alternately growl and sound like a pipe organ.  Overall, this is a thrilling and early example of the multi-movement suite.<br /><br />The two bonus tracks on Disc 1 are OK and were recorded live on the Top Gear show.<br /><br />The Grass is Greener (***)<br /><br />Released shortly after The Valentyne Suite, The Grass is Greener includes a few tracks from the Valentyne Suite and tracks written with new member guitarist/vocalist Dave Clempson (the lineup was the same, with this single exception).  While the album is not bad overall, and presents a nice blend of jazz, psychedelic rock and heavy British blues, I have to admit that I was not completely bowled over - it is much heavier and the \\"artiness\\" that made the Valentyne Suite album so enjoyable is not present.  While the new tracks are not too bad, Bolero does not work well at all from a composition perspective.  I also feel that breaking up the three \\"movement\\" Valentyne Suite was not such a hot idea - as it appears on the album, The Grass is Greener (third \\"movement\\") just seems to hang in space.  Overall, while there are some cool moments here and there, along with some decent playing, this album is neither as cohesive, nor imaginative as the Valentyne Suite.<br /><br />All in all, the Valentyne Suite is an exciting listen and might be considered a good example of the proto-progressive style.  For those folks that are interested, the offshoot projects including Greenslade (Dave Greenslade and Tony Reeves) and Colosseum II (Jon Hiseman) are also good and worth checking out.tely growl and sound like a pipe organ.

0060922583|5.0|Michael Talbot's \\"The Holographic Universe\\" is one of the best and most meticulously researched books ever written by someone who does not promote his or her own ideas and views (such as a scientist/researcher) but rather puts together current scientific and spiritual thinking as it is. Definitely a must read for everyone in search of knowledge and understanding about the world in which we live. Considering that it first came out in 1991 with dozens of books published on higher consciousness ever since, Talbot's talent becomes even more obvious. Another, highly recommendable, more recent book in the same tradition is Lynne McTaggart's \\"The Field\\".
B0018RWMNM|5.0|Absolute best Western ever put on film, a real collectors item, Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones make this epic leap off the screen.
B001GM28HO|2.0|A thematic album about \\"Fame\\" with maybe one or two great songs (Poker Face being the best - I've listened to it a few dozen times so far).  Most of the songs on this album are stylistically simple and repetitive, consisting of occasionally good and rarely great lyrical hooks, simple musical composition that usually sounds as though a few samples have been overly used, and a repetitive sub-theme throughout many of the songs invoking a boy-girl motif even when this barely makes sense with respect to the particular \\"Fame\\" motif of the rest of the song.    Worth buying used or at half price for the two or three better songs on it, but not worth paying full price.  Catch the music videos on YouTube or elsewhere - they tend to be quite good.  Hope Lady Gaga gets more professional and complex in the future.    This first album wasn't worth listening all the way through for me (though I did), catch the music yourself someplace and decide whether it is for you, or just pay a couple of dollars for a cheap used version, so you won't regret the waste of money.    Edit to add:  The spoken (non singing) part of \\"Poker Face\\" reminded me of the style of Peaches, and I wonder whether Peaches influenced Lady Gaga in any way.
0739368435|4.0|I was about to give up on this book in the beginning ... too many names to keep track of.  But then, as the storyline progressed, it caught my attention and I was hooked through the ending!  What a delightful society.
0385338732|5.0|Sophie Kinsella hit the nail write on the head with this one. I love all of her books, but this one has to be my favorite to date. It was such a page turner I couldn't put it down. All of the great twists and intresting plot makes you wonder what going to happen next, as well as, what if. If your looking for a great read for this summer or any time this book is it.
0887307280|5.0|This book is well worth your time and money. It is easy to read and explains the reseans why small businesses fail and why they also succeed.
B002AR9YPI|5.0|Multiple listens reveal a rich complexity that becomes increasingly engaging.  I encourage you to listen to \\"While You Wait for the Others\\" several times prior to forming a conclusive opinion about this incredible album.  These guys are great musicians, and are a very tight band in concert.  I saw them live in Portland opening up their Veckatimest tour, and was repeatedly impressed by their imaginative and creative approach to these songs.  My favorite album of recent months.
B00003CXDB|4.0|The SEC in this 1980's film is far more effective than the SEC of 2008, but this is a film and the SEC was pretty much worthless back then too. Trust is the basis for business, not greed. When you can't trust financial statements, CEO and executives consistently lie, and you reward incompetence then the system fails.    You look at a movie like WallStreet and realize not much is different from the 80's. The cycles repeat, there is no limit to human greed, it is far easier for a good person to go bad than a bad person to ever go good and it is a bit depressing.    It's funny looking at Wall Street with the green text monitors, brick cell phones, 80's style excess, and everything is dated, but you also realize the movie's story and warnings are the same today in 2009.

B00003CXB4|5.0|The circle of life. It's funny how an old African tale taken by Disney and made into this film captures some of life's truths and shows some of the great sadness and joy most people experience as they repeat the steps of those that came before.    Death and loss, love, birth, great friendship, responsibility, loyalty, betrayal, evil, bravery, and more are shown in the transformation of these creature characters as well as the land itself.    Following the birth of Simba, seeing some of his childhood adventures, his self banishment, his upbringing with a wort hog and meercat, going back to face his fears, and the interaction of his family, friends, and subjects is very well done.    The animation is incredible. Still before Pixar and mostly computer animation. Music and score are also incredible with several catchy and fun tunes, a great love song, African flavored beats and chants, and touching instrumentals.    The Lion King is in the group of Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin as what I consider 'Modern Day.' Disney classics where it was still hand animation with artists before Pixar and computers took over.    There still isn't a Pixar film that feels the same as classic Disney or the 4 films listed above.
B001AN2BMG|5.0|The insanity hit home! Will always be a part of who I am today. Any addiction fits, drugs, relationships, food, sex...look in the mirror and apply the lyrics.  This is an awesome, awesome (I meant to say that twice)CD from beginning to end. I can't say enough about this! Motley Crue was destructive and pointless. This S#!% is real!   Keep it coming! Forever a Favorite! 11 yrs, 5 months, 15 days ago was my first day sane! LOVE your sound, lyrics, and humor!  Don't sweat it if you can't top this cause this will always be a TOP!

B001PPGAIA|2.0|What was this supposed to be ?<br /><br />Based on the previews we thought we were going to see some large scale epic \\"Gone With The Wind\\" type drama with classy elegance .......<br /><br />Instead AUSTRALIA started right out of the gate with a strange blend of campy humor, cheesy action, tounge in cheek jokes, poor Clint Eastwood impersonations, etc..etc..etc..<br /><br />It felt like the movie did not know what it wanted to be .. humor, drama, epic, ?????<br /><br />After 40 minutes my wife screamed at me ..... \\"Please take that DVD out, I can't take anymore.  This is just bad\\"<br /><br />That about sums it up.<br /><br />Certainly not deserving of Kidman and Jackman (both of whom we like).
B001RTP48G|5.0|This is from my point of view one of the best album they have released in years! Believe me I have all their cds and I think this is a wonderful comeback! After nearly 25 years of music, the Pet Shop Boys sure found a new way to rewards their loyal fans. If you like great electro-pop with superb melodies with a touch of melancholy and grooves, this the one! The bonus cd alone deserves five stars. The bonus cd is like a collection of extended versions of the songs of the album and they are excellent! Don't miss the best Pet Shop Boys album ever!

1563899426|3.0|I recently started this series and am now in to the third book.  I found this book to be interesting but not that great of a story to get me hooked.  However, I took the time to read through the second book which is when I got attached.      This book can probably detach people from the great stories to come for a number of reasons.  In the first couple of pages there is a scene with sex pretty well laid out.  They have a number of cuss words that really don't serve a purpose.  It is definitely more adult than I think it needs to go to still tell a good story. I understand this is part of the story's mood, but still it is not necessary at times to go as far as they do in this story.    If you read this book and feel like it is so so, don't worry.  It gets better.  The next book moves a bit faster and starts to lay a great foundation.  It is much more different than many of the other stories out there right now.      My only wish with this series is that they would cut down the unnecessary over the top mature themes and make it more accessible to teenagers and other youth that might otherwise have a great story to enjoy.  I would love to share these stories with my friends and family but the f bombs they have to throw out randomly and sex scenes keep me from doing it.  I take a pen and censor the parts that are over the top so if anyone would be interested it could be a bit more pg 13.
B002AWM1CG|5.0|Peter is very lucky because he can fly about all day and make Captain Hook's life a misery. I bought the American version of this also because there is a scene cut out of the UK version. This is the scene where Hook and Peter are in the Black Castle. I read this on the Internet a few days ago and then bought the US version. It has arrive today and works okay.<br /><br />Both films are excellent,UK and the US version.<br /><br />I have ordered the French Blu-Ray version with the English language.
B001QOOCTE|4.0|What a tremendously uplifting DVD and CD. The songs are just great. The around-the-world production is not only interesting, but it typifies the point the songs themselves are making. Well worth the purchase. I can't get the DVD off of my TV or the CD out of the player!
B001TH16DI|2.0|I could have sworn that when I examined this title earlier in may, there were about 400 \\"1 star\\" reviews, but now only 40.  What happened??????
B000LXH0AE|5.0|I'm so glad to own this movie. I was tickled upon first seeing it, and now having seen it several times I've only found it to get better with each viewing. There are so many things about it to absorb-- visually, in terms of the premise and the moral, and also a wonderful and wonderfully executed script. I might also mention that not only have I never been a Will Ferrel fan, I very strongly disliked him.. but his performance was just what the movie called for. I feel giddy when I think about this movie.. and would most certainly recommend it to anyone!
B000KJU1MS|5.0|I, for one, am not, by any stretch of the means, the biggest Kiss fan, but as an objective viewer and listener, I could not help but be enthralled by the early showmanship of Peter, Gene, Paul, and Ace as portrayed in this disc collection.    Though one might object to the lyrics or songs of the Kiss catalogue, alone, how they portrayed themselves on stage could be an entirely different matter. There was more to the performances than just the glitter, the 7-inch heels, the fake blood, the smoke, etc. As a band, Kiss has been able to put on a great show, both vocally and instrumentally.    Visual settings with the advanced, creative pyrotechnics at the time served as an iconic, Barnum and Bailey type front. However, it was the live music itself that drew millions of fans worldwide. Studio releases could not do Kiss justice; for example, the staple Rock and Roll All Nite seems, to me, most bland when compared with any of their on-stage versions.     Overall, Kissology, Volume I is a great package. As for the icing on the cake, there is lead guitarist Ace Frehley's outlandish 1977 performance of Shock Me, which I deem as one of the best electric guitar demonstrations ever, along with Jimi Hendrix's Wild Thing at Monterey.    So for those who want to know how Kiss ever came to be the multiplatinum-selling artists we know of today, this is a perfect source to start with.
0307387178|4.0|This book wasn't horrible, but it wasn't brilliant either. I read it because i've read Into thin Air by Jon Krakauer and loved that book. Into the Wild was, overall, a good story line and written well, but wasn't really my type of book and failed to keep me interested throughout.  It is about a boy named Chris McCandless who decides to ditch the average american lifestyle and take to the road. He gives away his savings to charity and ventures out to the wild. The book takes you through the places he traveld,  the things he does, and the people he meets. It was pretty interesting but because of the format of the book, there was no suspense. I did not like how Jon Krakauer acted as if he knew all these details and facts for sure. He had never even met Chris McCandless, he doesn't know what words he would say, or his reasonings behind what he did. Sure he can guess, but his voice throughout the book became cocky, as if he knew exactly what happened when in reality, there are plenty of arguements circulating about how Chris really died.   I wouldnt necessarily go tell anyone to read this one, but if you've got some time to kill you might as well. It's not horrible, but not the grasping story I thought it'd be either.
0307474275|5.0|This is one of the most fascinating books I've read in a long time. It really grips you. While I know some people have really delved deeply into some of the ideas that Brown suggests, I think you should look at it more as fun reading rather than some sort of expose. If you like good books, then this is a good one. Just don't take it too seriously.
B001490ZME|5.0|I loved watching the first season so I bought the set for my husband so he could catch up and enjoy season 2 with me every Sunday night!!
B001FB55MG|4.0|This movie was really good, only we thought that they could of done more with it.  The grandkids enjoyed it as well so it is a well rounded movie for the family.
B0013FXWU6|1.0|I have a theory----If you're miserable, hate rich oil people, hate religious people, and have numerous personal issues yourself (maybe bad marriage, bad parents, bad kids) or you just feel deprived of something even though you have the world on a silver platter. And especially if like Oscar buzz movies despite it being yet another a dark cliche   Then this movie IS FOR YOU!
B000VNMMQG|5.0|An excellent film.  It is inspiring in that it shows how one man's faith in God translated into persistent, intelligent action in the face of many daunting obstacles, to produce world-changing results.  Thought-provoking in that it challenges us to reflect on how we can have an impact on society in our context, if we are willing to take risks for what we say we believe in.  It deals with core issues such as guilt, redemption, integrity, human rights, responsibility and of course, grace.
B001RLP862|1.0|The Dura-flex cards are actually more expensive than Copag on a per deck basis, but fail to match Copag's quality on several levels.     First is that these cards are much easier to crease than you'd think. I creased a card on the very first shuffle in my first pack. Take a joker out of a Copag deck and a Bicycle deck, and bend them both at the same time. You'll notice that the Copag is *far* more resilient than the Bicycle Duraflex.    Second is how they feel in the hand. It is a textured feel, but one that is very unnautral. Its supposed to feel more like a standard paper card, but I think they missed the mark on this.    Third, the cards have a noticable chemical smell to them straight out of the package. When you shuffle the cards for the first time, you notice that this chemical is rubbing off on your fingers.    Fourth, QC seems to be much lower, as I had to look at packs on the shelf to make sure that I wasnt getting a pack with a creased card. Maybe that is because the cards are made in China. Other card makers have made quality craftsmanship a point of pride, whereas I dont feel this is the case for this specific Bicycle product.    If this was a $4-$5 deck, I'd give it a higher rating. But since it is trying to be competitive as a \\"high end\\" deck of cards and not the \\"middle range\\" deck that it truly is, I have to rate it 1 star.
B00003CWPL|4.0|I love a lot of DAVID LYNCH'S work,but i've never seen this film! I recently viewed it on the SUNDANCE channel 2 weeks ago,it was the most weird,strange,hard to understand,and craziest film i've ever seen from DAVID LYNCH but I actually found the film to be somewhat entertaining!
0743267478|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. An excellent plot and written in a way that keeps you turning the pages. I have chosen not to watch the movie because I am too scared that the plot would be ruined. Having to know the story before the question is revealed really makes you think while reading and does not allow you to stop reading. At the end it is all pulled together with a great conclusion. Ram Mohammad Thomas' luck is so overpowering this story is almost a fairy tale. A delightful read for anyone old enough to deal with torture, abuse and a few other adult topics. Overall, a fabulous novel.
B001MEJY8W|4.0|This extremely gory horror film from France is obviously not for all tastes, but it is very well done and interesting for those with a strong stomach. It starts as a somewhat run of the mill - if extremely bloody - example of the torture porn film genre - a seemingly deranged woman enters a home and kills all the members of its seemingly nice family. But as the movie progresses, it turns into something else - the woman was kept by this family when she was a child in a dungeon - and it has a stunning and very original twist in the final and brutal last half hour - not going to reveal too much here, but this family was part of a sect seemingly trying to decipher some of life's existential mysteries. Overall, one of the best horror films released in the last few years.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|This CD is one of the best! Duffy has a terrific voice and it comes thru very well! Love it!
B001N26GFM|1.0|During World War II, the unbelievably naive eight year old child of the Nazi commander of a concentration camp becomes the friend, through the barbed wire (with nary a guard in sight) of an eight year old inmate of said camp. Eventually, he decides to enter the camp (excavating a tunnel through it!) to help his friend find his father. Their destiny is (spoiler ahead) the gas chamber, in a jaw dropping awful scene. Unabashedly sentimental and terribly manipulative, this movie makes Roberto Benigni's famously awful \\"Life is Beautiful\\" a model of taste by comparison. Maybe in the original book (which I have not read) this works as a fable, but I'm not exaggerating by saying that there is not a single moment in this film that is believable. For starters: If it was so easy to enter the camp, with just a shovel, how come the inmates didn't escape?. And the scene where the mother cries as the rain is pouring when she realizes the fate of her child and the camera moves upward is a textbook case of cinematic manipulation. Avoid this at all costs.
B001UREJWM|5.0|Old fashioned rock-n-roll at it's finest.  Dio can still belt out the lyrics, like he always has!  Keep Rockin!

B000005RNQ|4.0|I have re-discovered SAXON in my late 30s. I was into Metal back in the 80s and these guys always flew under the radar. 10 songs are all solid, just wish the cd was longer and offered a re-mastered version. Great taste of Saxon and a good starting album.
B001U7FWM8|5.0|My mates showered Veckatimest in so much praise that I went into listening the album with lowered expectations to be blown away.  Suffice it to say, this album went above and beyond that.  I join the legions that talk up the record's obvious points:  the beautiful harmonies, the tight arrangements, the nod to the 60's, the meticulous attention to detail.
B00000IMTH|4.0|Album is great , but remastered version has NO Bonus tracks. Sounds good and rocks, but is too short. get a used copy.
B00197POXG|5.0|I purchased this set for my older son's birthday. He has cerebral palsy and can't read. He loves the stories and often shares with us what he has watched. There is a lot of background information about the actors and the filming as well. Buying the complete set made certain that we didn't miss any episodes and it was less expensive than buying each season separately. Each CD has it's own envelope rather than a hard case taking up much less room on the shelf.

B001NLL8LA|5.0|Like most of the Jack Reacher novels, this one starts off with a bang, but a coincidental bang. Poor ol' Jack Reacher is in the wrong place at the wrong time, again.<br /><br />While many find this annoying and downgrade stars for it, I think it's pretty much a necessity for this series. Jack's just one of those guys. And, well, I don't know, but I hope if I ever get in trouble that ol' Jack just happens to be there to save the day. :-)<br /><br />This is a great page-turner that you won't want to put down.<br /><br />Contemporary issues regarding terrorism. Very realistic.<br /><br />Are Jack's skills a bit 'over the top'?  Sure, but the same can be said for James Bond.<br /><br />Take it for what it is: A Fun, Action Packed roller coaster ride!
B001CDLAT4|5.0|My husband wanted this title after someone at work recommended it. I must say it is worth the time to watch. There are no words but the pictures and music are phenominal. Just understanding the cultures of the planet has to be beneficial to the world. Great documentary!

B00005N6KG|5.0|I listen to music all the time and tend to burn out headphones pretty quickly - always have. I have had these headphones for 8 YEARS! They are fantastic! They are the best I have EVER had! When I got them I used to walk around with a Sony Discman, now I use them for my Ipod. It's the best $10 I have ever spent. Everyone should have a pair of these.
B0012GMV58|2.0|This is NOT the beloved Santana of the original 3 albums he is mostly known for.  This is a complete departure from Latin rock, and a dive into lite jazz fusion jam sessions.<br />I didnt enjoy this album at all.  It is too dated, the early 70's really do come thru here, sounds, lyrics, almost drugged out California feel to it.  Some songs too short, others way too long.  In all, this album is a collection of amateur mindless jamming; any garage jazz band in the 70's could've released this nonesense.  Now imagine Santana releasing this one as their 1st album, would they have had any success or been recognized as one of the most influential bands in Rock?<br />For hardcore, Santana collectors only.

0307341569|5.0|This was the most entertaining and well-crafted novel I have read in a long time.  No, it's not going to change the way you view the world or offer any great insights into life, but wow!  What a skillfully-written piece of work.  The execution is nearly flawless, and I couldn't stop reading it.  The build-up is perfectly paced and the ending is unpredictable, yet satisfying.  The characters were also believable, despite the very bizarre situations they found themselves in.  What more can you ask for in a crime novel?  I will read everything Flynn writes from now on.  It's so good, I wish I could read it all over again for the first time.

B00005JKL8|4.0|Navy pilot Lt. Chris Burnett (Owen Wilson) is bored out of his mind. All he ever does is run exercises or fly routine reconnaissance missions for a war he doesn't even truly understand. Until one day when he and his co-pilot, Stackhouse, are shot down by two surface-to-air missiles over Serbia. After parachuting down, Burnett begins to walk up a hill to try and get a better signal on his radio. As he nears the top of the hill, he notices that Stackhouse is being questioned by a Serbian rebel army. When the Serbs are through questioning Stackhouse, the hunt for Burnett begins. Lost in unfamiliar territory, Burnett runs for his life from the Serbs trying to get to an open area to be rescued. But what Burnett doesn't know is the politics that are being played out behind the scenes.  Because the two pilots flew into a no fly zone, the navy can not just go in and rescue their men unless they want to cause a full blown war. Hopefully Burnett will be able to survive long enough for the red tape to be cut, and the Navy can send in the marines to rescue him.<br /><br />\\"Behind Enemy Lines\\" can be way over the top, but it really brings back the memories of the good 80's action movies where you left behind your brain and loved to believe that a man in a red head band could single handedly bring down Vietnam, North Korea, or the whole darn continent of Asia if he wanted to. Or when a man with bare feet could take down a terrorist group with witty lines inside a sky scraper. Or even when the governor of California came back through time to destroy the man that would destroy the future that hasn't been created yet. Ok sure it's nowhere near as good as Rambo, Die Hard, or Terminator, but it is a lot of fun. While those movies are great, there are always parts where you can pick them apart and say \\"Oh come on\\". \\"Behind Enemy Lines\\" is filled with a lot of cool scenes, and some tense moments. From the mine field, to the fight in a war torn city (a tank inside a building blowing the crap out of things), and to the final moments with a sniper honing down upon Burnett, the movie never really lets up. There were so many things though that I could tell you was wrong, but why really? When it comes down to action films, as long as they aren't trying to be very realistic (like Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down), you just have to sit back, grab the popcorn, turn up the volume, and watch the crazy explosions, the blazing guns, and all the crazy car chase or dog fight scenes.<br /><br />While I like the \\"Behind Enemy Lines\\", it's definitely not the best movie out there, but it is a very fun action movie.

B002AR9YPI|5.0|This is a simply fantastic record and a huge step forward for Grizzly Bear. The tracks play like individual vignettes, but the record comes together seamlessly. Definitely in the running (along with Animal Collective's new set and \\"Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix\\") as Best of 2009.
B001R4MEYS|5.0|It don't matter what kind of metal you are into.  This is one of the best metal recordings ever.  What?  That's right.  This sits next to \\"City\\" or \\"Alien\\" by Strapping Young Lad and \\"Rust In Peace\\" by Megadeth.  It is life-changing.    Am I exaggering?  No.  When an outsider looks at our state of metal and choses 10 recordings (of all time), he/she will most definitely pick this one.  It's amazing.  And my metal friends agree, it's stellar.  \\"Crack the Skye\\" may be one of the best 10 songs ever.  EVER.  \\"Ghost of Kerelia\\" is only a scoch less amazing.  \\"The Czar\\" and \\"The Last Baron\\" are penultimate metal/prog recordings.  I assure you, you will love them.  The first three tracks are, well, really good; but all potential radio biscuits.  They're still 4.5/5 metal recordings, but they can't overshadow the later 2/3rds of the record.    Trust me, my friends, you will love this record.  It is truly a milestone in American music.

I studied using two different Kaplan books and took a review course.  I bought this book for extra practice and did every math problem listed.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|My husband has not read the book series and he loves this show.  We never miss an episode and I can't wait until 6/14 - when season 2 begins.<br />My co-workers and I were reading this series before the TV show came out.  It was like we were in competition, every morning we would get together a chat about the book series.  Then the show came out and we did the same thing, every morning we would grab coffee and chat about the show.  It made waiting for the 9 book easier.  If you haven't read the book series get them today.  If you haven't watched this series - get caught up before season 2 begins you will not be disappointed.
B00002E224|5.0|Jesse and Celine are two people from different parts of the world. Jesse from America and Celine from France. Funny how time works. While both are riding separately on a train in Austria, their paths cross, and they begin to chat. The chat leads into having conversation over a meal in the lounge car. As the train comes to a stop where Jesse is to get off, he's so captivated with Celine, he asks her to get off with him and just get to know each other more while in Vienna. As the night goes on, the attraction they have for each other begins to grow. But the inevitable is on the horizon as the sun begins to rise, and their one day of happiness begins to come to a close.<br /><br />`Before Sunrise' is truly one of the best romantic movies I think I have ever seen. It's not some sappy chick flick where some of the most absurd moments happen. It honestly feels real. Especially if you've ever fallen in love before. The first time meeting that special someone and how everything just clicks. How you can't get enough of each other and want to soak in everything they say and do like you're a thirsty dry sponge. The movie is littered with dialogue. It almost feels like a book on CD, but video...heh. But not once did I get bored. Sometimes their talking could go a little on and on, but in a way, isn't that how it is in real life sometimes? There have been many times where I would catch myself just babbling away at a story.  And while the movie is a romantic movie, it's still filled with some good laughs. So don't think it's just one big \\"OH SMOOCH ME ALL NIGHT LONG\\", because it isn't. When Jesse and Celine kiss, it was a little goofy the way it came about, but it was, you know, cute I guess (ugh). But later Celine kind of dogs on Jesse for trying to be all romantic to get that first kiss. It made me laugh. But seriously, I can't get over how the movie brought back memories of the first time I fell in love. The awkward meeting, the constant talking, never wanting to leave each others sides, the first kiss, the goofy romance, the sweet romance, and never once thinking about time. What a great movie. I can't believe I've owned this movie for about 3 years and never even gave it the time of day. Alphabetical reviewing wins again!<br /><br />If you love a good love story, own this. If you are looking for a good date movie, then definitely give this a rent. I think both guys and girls will like it. Well, I can see some guys out there rolling their eyes at it...hehe.<br /><br />P.S. - One of the biggest reasons why I never gave this a shot was because of the stupid cover. Looks like Ethan Hawke is choking Julie Delpy out! But then you realize its some goofy hair flip maneuver.

0783233477|5.0|Amazingly I didn't see this film until nearly 10 years after its release. It is a grand scale masterpiece. If you missed it, don't bother renting it...buy the DVD to rewatch and treasure with people you love. Superbly cast and wonderfully acted, with breathtaking cinematography and a beautiful musical score, Meet Joe Black is truly unforgetable.  Take time out to really enjoy it without distraction. It envelopes you like a great book. Anthony Hopkins is simply fabulous.  The scenes of him describing his wife and imparting love and wisdom to his daughters are deeply moving. Brad Pitt delivers an amazing, both tender and haunting performance as Death seeking a taste of love and life. Clare Forlarni is absolutey exquisite throughout. This is a smart love story that guys will enjoy as much as the ladies.
0316044695|5.0|I had the pleasure of reading this great book about a month ago.  I will never forget the pain and sacrifice that Marcus and his teammates suffered for our beloved country. This is a wonderful book and I highly recommend it. I am so grateful for all of the brave men and women in our armed forces.  Thank you for your willingness to serve our country and defend our freedom.  God bless you all.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this cd! Adele has amazing vocals and she touches me deep inside with her lyrics. Her pain, her funny personality, and just life in general. I can't wait to see her perform at the Hollywood Bowl this summer. Great CD! I highly recommend it.
1416972242|4.0|Just like the first book in this trilogy, [[ASIN:1416914285 City of Bones (Mortal Instruments)]] there were so many twists and turns that I was surprised at how fast I finished reading it. I become quickly entwined in the story, and book left me wanting more.  This book was more captivating and better written then the first one.  As soon as I finished this book I went out and bought the third one, [[ASIN:1416914307 City of Glass (Mortal Instruments)]].
B00127RAJY|5.0|This video is an amazing tool to get strong and get lean....it only takes 30 minutes with warm up and cool down...(who doesnt have time for that?)beginners can modify the moves to make them easier, either by using smaller hand weights or following Jillians modification instruction...it really kicks your butt, then you find it getting easier, and you move up a level and it kicks your butt again! Then that level gets easier, and before you know it you are no longer modifying moves, you are hanging in there with Jillian on level 3, and it feels GREAT! This is a program I feel I can stick with, and the results are quicker and better than anything else I have tried, which is just about everything! But be warned..you may want to ignore the scale for a while. This program WILL build muscle if you are using 3-5 pound hand weights, getting your protein intake, and doing it consistantly. My \\"happy weight\\" is now 125, and it used to be 120. I have ALOT  more muscle, my arms are cut up, my abs are SHREDDED for the first time in my life, my legs are toned...and that means I gained muscle weight. My body has a much lower fat content...(I lost 10 lbs of fat) but I weigh more than I  used to. I started this because I gained 10 pounds in two years, going from 120 to 130...I wanted to lose 10 pounds. I lost five, but look way better than I did at 120 two years ago, and I fit into all of my old clothes perfectly. So ladies, pay attention to your jeans and your mirror, not your scale. Jillian herself is 5'2, and weighs 120, and is a size 2. Most girls who are 5'2 and a size 2 weight about 110. So dont let the numbers get you down...just flex your arms or your abs after you get them, and remind yourself it is muscle! Remember to get your protein...half as many grams of it as you weigh, each day. (If you weigh 120 you want 60 grams per day) otherwise you wont build your muscle! Buy this video...DO IT at least 5x per week...watch your calories...and be strong. You can do it! BTW, I have only done this 3 months, 5x per week. I noticed a difference after 3 weeks.
B001TODCII|5.0|I haven't seen a action flick like this for a long time, it will never bore you. Liam Neeson is my new favorite actor, his role is so cool. The fight scenes are amazing with out being to unrealistic. The blood and gore are kept to a real minimuim in fact there really isn't any. If you enjoy action flicks with style and substance, I would think that you will enjoy this. Its a treat! I give it 5 stars.

1416955070|3.0|This book introduces you to Clary and her new Shadowhunter friends (Jace Wayland and Isabelle and Alec Lightwood).  Even though the plot is predictable, the book is fast pace and full of twists. I have recommended (and loaned my) book to several people and they have now picked up on the trilogy.  The only reason I didn't give this more stars was that it read like the author took concepts from other series and used them to create this world.
055358894X|5.0|With The Lies of Locke Lamora, Scott Lynch has not only burst into the modern fantasy scene, but also positioned himself as the man to beat. 'Lies' balances an appropriately convoluted plot with beautifully developed characters in a subtly magical world.     Lynch eschews the seduction of detailed world-building, but still puts Locke, Jean and friends in the midst of a fantastic magical city with the enticing depth of Gormenghast or Viriconium. The characters themselves are complex, wonderful and ultimately quite real - it is a shame that the genre placement of this book will keep Locke from ever getting the recognition he deserves as a literary (and tragic) hero.    The plot - alternately jumping forwards and backwards in Locke's past - is astoundingly complicated, yet still easy to follow. Scott Lynch deserves praise for keeping track of the plot alone - much less rendering it in such a way to make it easily engaging to the reader.    With Abercrombie, Morgan, Rothfuss and Lynch all turning out incredible new series, we're easily living in a 'golden age' for the fantasy genre. I'd be hard-pressed to choose between them, but with 'Lies of Locke Lamora', Lynch makes a great case for being the best of the lot.
0321543726|5.0|I agree with Hubert above.  This book is great for the \\"advanced beginner\\".  I too have been through several of the shorter, more to the point, \\"teach yourself C++\\"-style books.  I am glad that I did those first.  I am totally self-taught and unfortunately have no mentor to ask anything.  This is the first book that has spent any time on data validation and parsing and has introduced catching errors as part of the bigger picture rather that a discrete subject.  This is the way it should be be done.      Chapters 6 introduces parsing.  This has been the missing link for me. As soon as you start writing anything beyond the simplest of programs you run into the problem of needing to validate and make sense of user input.  You always just knew that there had to be a \\"standard\\" way of doing this because the problem is so fundamental, however, the answer is not obvious.  I developed a far simpler \\"home-grown\\" parser for an ip address calculator program I wrote but using token objects is FAR superior.  (which makes me wonder about how many other things I know nothing about)  It is not simple and I spent a lot of time reading and trying to truly internalize the chapter and doing the exercises.  However, I do wish that more of the answers were published on his site for those of us working at home alone without the benefit of a professor.      Also, graphics and GUIs are given some coverage.  This is also unusual for a beginner book.  None of the others that I have does this.  I think it is important to show that C++ is graphics friendly early on otherwise the ignorant get the impression that only newer languages like VB can handle such things.    So, basically I see this book as a cornerstone in your self-education.  It you are working alone it is going to take some time and effort to plow through this monster. (Especially if you do the in-chapter exercises and problems.) But it is a very good book and will likely serve as a nice gateway to more advanced books on the subject.
0307269752|3.0|Mikael Blomkvist, a muckracking financial journalist, has just lost a libel case lodged against him by the powerful businessman Wennerstrom.  Through a series of strangely engineered circumstances, he ends up working for another businessman, Henry Vanger, and is tasked with finding out what happened to Henry's neice Harriet,  who had disappeared over 30 years earlier.  Through some more strange circumstances, he ends up partnered with expert researcher Lisbeth Salander.  Salander is a strange character, alternating between sullen silence and aggression in her dealings with people.  She has lots of tattoos (she is the title character of the book, though she is not the main character) and it is hinted that they represent past traumas, but her past is not revealed. She is an interesting but not fully developed character. She hits it off with Blomkvist, for no obvious reason other than that the author likes both these characters and would like them to get along.<br /><br />The lead-up was great - the increasingly intricate research the characters needed to go through to gain new, overlooked information on the case had me reading late into the night. However, when I finished the book I felt sort of let down.  Here are the reasons:<br /><br />1. In the development of the book, the author depicted the Vanger family as a highly dysfunctional, but still realistic and believable, family.  Most of the events of the book also seemed to be depicted in a realistic manner, but some of the events/revelations of the resolution went right over-the-top and actually weakened the realism of what came before.<br /><br />2. The resolution requires all characters involved to make moral compromises that did not sit easily with my expectations of a real resolution.<br /><br />3.  After the resolution of the main case, another 50 pages are spent wrapping up the Wennerstrom affair; this is vaguely interesting but also very anticlimactic after what came before.

1416914307|5.0|This third installment was awesome and even through a friend spoiled the ending for me; I just couldn't wait to read it myself.  This book kept me up all night. I never wanted to stop I just keep telling myself I'll stop at the end of this chapter but I never did.  Even though I knew that this was the end of the trilogy, I feel that it needed a few more chapters and maybe a epilogue.  Hopefully, we will get to see these characters again, but if not a least we can look forward to Chassandra Clare's new trilogy \\"The Infernal Devices.\\"
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I remember when this group came out when I was in high school and my first thought was, \\"Great, two chicks making out on screen. That's probably the only thing they're good for.\\"  But recently I caught one of their songs at a party (Clowns) and as stupid as some of the songs may seem because of their titles (ex. Malchik Gay) I bought the CD used just so I can try it out and see without having to pay a lot of cash.  All I gotta say is that the CD is pretty damn good. Obviously it's not the best music in the world but in the end I enjoy listening to the songs especially \\"Show Me Love\\", I thought that one was the best. Some of this music I use for working out or while I'm driving cause it gives you a rush (Not Gonna Get Us, Clown, Show Me Love). I'm looking to get the next album because it seems to me that these chicks actually got something.
0385512058|4.0|I recently spent a spent some tell with an old friend who just graduated from Harvard Business School.  Needless to say, he's never going to have a problem earning money or holding down a job.  He'll likely get positions many of us will deeply envy - not just because of the pay, but because of the cutting-edge type of work these positions are responsible for.    How does he know he'll always be ok?  It's not just his resume.  It actually has to do more with fact that he's now joined the fraternity of HBS alumni that takes care of its own and always leaves the door open for a meeting, a phone call, or even just an email exchange.  Imagine for a moment how different your view of the world would be if you knew that no matter what happened in your working life, there would always be another opportunity waiting for you.    In Keith Ferrazi's book \\"Never Eat Alone,\\" he discusses the many ways we can create our own powerful network that we'll be able to rely on throughout our life.  The book offers some great ideas to meet new people and expand your sphere of influence, and while his ego comes across a bit in the writing, don't let it stop you from digesting the important underlying advice.  This is one of my favorite business books, and I periodically refer back to it in order to remind myself of the things I need to be doing in my daily life.    For many of us, including myself, networking goes against our core nature.  It is far easier to stay within our comfort zones of what and who we know.  But Keith Ferrazi challenges us to step outside while offering ways to build our networks painlessly and effectively.  This is a must-read for any young person entering the business world, whether they have a rich alumni network at their disposal or not.
B001AQMBHI|5.0|I have always been a fan of this movie. And now that it's in Blu Ray, it's a no brainer. This is a must have if you own a Blu Ray player. The Sound is awesome and picture quality is great for a movie this old.

B001U0HBPG|5.0|This is an exceptionally long movie--perfect for DVD viewing as you can take a break if you need to.    The acting was superb, the plot interesting with twists and turns that I didn't predict.  For me, the movie went by fast.    I think a key to this movie is that you either like it or you don't and you will know within the first 30 minutes or so.     I thought the special effects were amazing and I loved the psychological development of the characters.    Watching the extras on the DVD is interesting, although time consuming.    When you watch this movie more than once you pick up on different nuances that you didn't notice the first time.  I suppose that is always true, but seems more so with this since there is so much detail.
B00005JPS8|3.0|Love the movie , but something with the DVD happens, between 55-65 minutes the movie statrts to skip and stop. This happen with 2 different Iron Man DVD's. Amazon was great with there return policy. Maybe I just had bad luck.

0765350386|5.0|Sanderson's second book is as original and inventive as the first, Elantris.  In this book, he brings an original magic system, original setting, and an original idea: what if the bad guy wins?  Though some of the character development is lacking, the overall grittiness of the setting and plot and the cleverness of the magic system easily make up for it.  Personally, I didn't like the second book as much, till the end, but this and the third installment are very well done.  Also, Sanderson was chosen by Harriet McDougal, Robert Jordan's wife, to complete the Wheel of Time, so you know he's good in someone else's eyes, too.

0385340575|4.0|Gone Tomorrow is the 13th novel in the Jack Reacher series.  Reacher is a retired Army MP and a drifter who seems to find big trouble wherever he goes.   Reacher is a great character and all the novels in this series are entertaining, but they are very uneven in terms of plot credibility and overall enjoyment.    Gone Tomorrow is one of the absolute best of the series.  As the novel begins Reacher finds himself on the subway late at night in New York City and happens to see a passenger, Susan Mark, acting strangely.  This sets off all kinds of alarm bells for Reacher who is trained to spot terrorists and other nefarious characters looking to do others harm.  As the events unfold Reacher finds himself chasing, and being chased, by the FBI, the Department of Defense, the New York City Police Department, and a shadowy group of possible terrorists, all looking for a piece of explosive information, and willing to kill to get it.    This novel is a fast paced thriller and mystery and works extremely well as both.  The plot becomes intricate and mysterious as Reacher tries to find out who is behind the events unfolding, and then tries to discover why the information being sought is so important.  There are plenty of twists and turns as Reacher continues to unravel the mystery to a rather explosive and violent conclusion.    Other than a few quibbles over political details that are over generalized, this novel was a real page turner and very entertaining.  One of Lee Child's best.
B001NFNFIK|3.0|It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great. I have become a big Tommy Lee Jones fan over the past few years, and I enjoyed his acting in this murder mystery/ghost whatever it was.... I thought John Goodman was a little on the sloppy side with his portrayal of \\"Baby Feet Balboni\\" (hilarious mob boss name, btw), Peter Sarsgaard was kind of funny and did an OK job. I was confused by his role in the movie. I mean, I know he helped to move the plot along alot, but he was drunk more than half the time, which was so annoying, and I couldn't understand what he was saying sometimes. Mary Steenburgen was a nice surprise. I think she's a wonderful presence in any film. The rest of the cast was only so-so with their acting, definitely not up to par with Mr. Jones.<br /><br />The story was entertaining despite being confusing, and maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I had read the actual book first. I don't know...I think the producers were trying too hard. I got the gist of all the story lines, but I think this could have been done better and neater. Glad it was only a dollar rental.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I bought this for my mom for this past Mother's Day after she rented the series from our local library six consecutive times. I never had taken much interest in learning about history and therefore I very much dreaded watching all 6 or 7 hours with her. However I was pleasantly surprised that not only did this miniseries address things that I had learned years ago in high school, but also delved into subjects that were rarely discussed, such as the repercussions on the personal lives of the Adams family and the subtly calculated and sometimes very shady political tactics of some of our founding fathers. I found this combination of American history and personal history very captivating. This is sure to please everyone from history buffs to those that enjoy a good period piece.
0743454537|5.0|This book is eloquently written, gripping & moving.  Even when I thought I knew the turns the story would make, I was surprised.  Piccoult is an incredible author.  I look forward to reading more of her books!
B001FB55HG|4.0|When the news first broke that a fourth \\"Terminator\\" movie was in the works and that none other than \\"Charlie's Angels\\" director McG would be at the helm, the fan-boy world let out a collective groan. It helped matters that Christian Bale signed on to play the savior of the human race, John Connor, but for the most part, \\"Terminator Salvation\\" had an up-hill battle to fight. Here we are with the fourth installment in a franchise that many doubt should have gone past James Cameron's masterpiece, \\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day,\\" in the first place. This is the third director to tackle the material, with a script penned by the same guys who delivered the poorly received \\"Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines\\" (not to mention \\"Catwoman.\\" Yikes!). To make matters even more complicated, the script has been re-heated and doctored by Jonathan Nolan (\\"The Dark Knight\\") to make the role of John Connor bigger and fatter than in the original script. All of this, while being made within the constraints of a PG-13 rating (a first for the series) and a toy-company to pacify. With so many cooks in the kitchen, so many expectations to meet and so many watching and judging, it's quite amazing, then, that it turned out as well as it did.<br /><br />\\"Terminator Salvation\\" begins with Marcus (Sam Worthington), a man on death row for killing his brother, among others. Coerced by a cancer-ridden lover, Serena (Helena Bonham-Carter), he signs off on letting his soon-to-be-dead body be used for scientific experiments and advancements. We watch him receive only the best capital punishment that Texas can afford, only to find himself resurrected in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, circa 2018. The Judgment Day that Sarah Connor warned about has devastated mankind, as they fight for survival against Skynet and the machines who see humans as the enemy and seek to eliminate them. The self-fulfilling prophet, John Connor (Bale), has yet to take his rightful place, though. There are those who believe in him, and those in power (Michael Ironside) who don't. When his future (or his past) is put into question -- his future father, a teenage Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), is captured and on his way to termination -- he must work together with a man -- or a machine -- whom he was raised not to trust.<br /><br />If the story sounds incomplete, or that it's missing something, then you aren't alone. The biggest problem facing this film is its script. Maybe it worked better in its original form, but by making more room for the character of John Connor, it starts to bloat and loses its impact. It doesn't help that the film is short, clocking in at well under two hours, and doesn't allow enough time to flesh out its plot-points. For example, you'll notice Connor's wife (Bryce Dallas-Howard, replacing Claire Danes) is visibly pregnant, and yet, nothing is ever mentioned about it in the film. The character of Marcus Wright is an intriguing and original addition to the \\"Terminator\\" mythos, played perfectly and convincingly by Worthington. While this part of the story is fleshed out well-enough, it's often put on the sidelines to make screen-time for Bale/John Connor. While you couldn't ask for a better adult John Connor than Christian Bale, there's simply not enough for him to do in this film, other than to give inspiring speeches to his comrades or go hand-to-hand combat with the machines. He makes an imposing and impressive Connor, giving the expected intensity and presence, but the character is barely expanded upon what was already given to us in the first two films. In short, if you're a newcomer watching this flick, you're not likely to be convinced that this man is all that important to the future of mankind and maybe -- just maybe -- he's got an overblown ego and a nasty temper.<br /><br />On the upside of things, director McG (real name Joseph McGinty Nichols) deserves a round of applause. Not only did he take fan-boy criticisms in stride throughout the creation of the film, but on his end -- the direction -- the film is a smashing success. While the story is weak and flawed, the visual aspect of the film is stunning. Full-on, from the moment we are re-introduced to the John Connor character, you believe that what you are seeing is a post-Judgment day world. One key moment early in the film finds Connor's allies annihilated by a bomb, covering the area in a sea of smoke and a rain-storm of ash. It's a far-cry from the brief war scenes we were given in the previous \\"Terminator\\" films, and in this particular scene, inspiration seems to have been drawn from Steven Spielberg's World War II epic, \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\" Obviously, this is a fictional war, and not as dense as the real-life tragedy Spielberg portrayed in his film, but visually, McG nails it. Another spot where the film shines are in its special effects.  True to the late-Stan Winston's method, most of the effects are achieved practically, rather than relying too heavily on CGI. The Terminators in the film look not only mean and heartless, but real. Heck, we even get Arnold Schwarzenegger's face rendered to Roland Kickinger's body, to re-create the famous T-800, and it's hard to tell the difference between real and fake. All of this, of course, on top of one outrageous action sequence after another and nods to previous films galore. You'll see motorcycles chasing tractor-trailer trucks in an interesting role reversal, and you'll watch as John Connor sets traps to the tune of Guns N' Roses \\"You Could Be Mine.\\" All of these elements help seal the deal, making it feel like an authentic \\"Terminator\\" sequel and less of a cash-in (which, for the most part, it is). In the end, despite being light on plot and character development, \\"Terminator: Salvation\\" packs enough of a punch to be considered a worthy entry in the franchise and a brilliant summer blockbuster to boot.rection -- the film is a smashing success.

B00260HH3K|1.0|First and foremost I am a movie fan. A good movie is a good movie regardless of what it's based on and Dragon Ball Evolution is not a good movie. The plot is nonsensical,the story cliche ridden and the dialogue is absurd. The effects are just plain laughable, they look like B movie effects from ten years ago. The only good thing about this movie was that it ended.   STAY AWAY FROM THIS ABSURDITY! Shame on Fox for using Stephen Chow's name as producer to market this, he had no say regarding this film.
0671449028|3.0|This book is cute, up to Sandra Boyton's usual very funny standard, but it is not all that great for toddlers and preschoolers--just before bed they all go out to exercise vigorously which is exactly the wrong message to give kids at that time of day!. I read this to my older daughter when she was 2-4; it never really clicked. My 2nd (a boy) wasn't much interested in books unless they involved anything with wheels or firemen so I don't think we ever read this. Now on my 2nd daughter; it just doesn't excite us. There are so many other wonderful baby/toddler/preschool books out there, choose another, like Boyton's Moo Baa for the very 1st book (ours got completely worn out) Barnyard Dance which is just hysterically funny, or the Sheep in A Jeep/Shop etc series, or The Runaway Bunny or Jamberry or Jesse Bear... Those are truely GREAT. This one is just Ok.

0894803123|5.0|This book was written, I believe, in the 80s, which explains the raw egg thing. Yes, the book uses uncooked eggs. Modify the recipe to make an egg custard before you freeze it, using the same ingredients. I scald the dairy, adding a vanilla bean or anything else you want to infuse it with if you want, and then temper the eggs. I then return everything to the heat until it coats the back of a wooden spoon. Great custard-making help can be found in the first few pages of David Lebovitz's The Perfect Scoop, a great accompaniment to this book (these for the classic flavors and well known, his for more modern, unusual flavors).<br /><br />Your other option, of course, is to use those bottled egg products or you can buy in-shell pasteurized eggs. I have never made the recipes with either, but I don't see why that would be a problem.<br /><br />The recipes are both the classic Ben & Jerry's I have come to expect (Cherry Garcia, etc.) and plenty of flavors I have never had or even heard of. The company and personal history is fascinating.<br /><br />My only gripe is that it does not have a lay-flat binding or something that I consider to be essential in a cookbook. It's just a small paperback, but well worth that hassle. Totally recommended, as long as you keep in mind that the recipes are made with raw eggs.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|The item was received within days.  The corners were a little bent, but it was like described.
B001RTP48G|5.0|Excellent brand new CD.  I like the fact that instead of producing two different albums one for regular and one for dance/ mix  - they put it into a double CD.  I just hope they go on tour in the US with this new CD.    Sexy Northerner
B000MRAAJM|5.0|The images of the Blu-Ray are incredible. Each episode takes you on a journey to places that you will never have an opportunity to see first hand as many of the events are rare or in remotes places that are inaccessible. The big screen home theater with 1080p HD gives this documentry  a true wow factor. My hats off the the photographers involved. Recommend this to anyone who has any interest in traveling around our earth looking for the best that mother nature has. Though the BBC version is in metric, this version is just as good as the S Weaver/American version and sometimes better.
0762434279|4.0|I think that Rich Dad Poor Dad is a good book because it shows people how there are many different views of how to earn a succesful future and career.  It demonstrates that poeple have to work hard everyday in thier lives in order to have success and it takes time to build up a well earned future.  I enjoy how the author, Robert Kiyosaki, shows the reader the steps and lessons that he learned while growing up to become rich.  I really enjoyed reading this book and I reccommend others to read this book since the author spends his time to explain in an orderly fashion how to become rich through working and studying hard.

B000U0F7RG|5.0|The most interesting aspect of this series is its consistent quality. Unlike some of my other favorite series such as  [[ASIN:B000SK5ZKW Monarch of the Glen]], where you first get used to the characters, the quality rises around the middle of the series, and then drops off and the original magic dissipates. If you liked one episode of The Gilmore Girls you will probably like the whole series.<br /><br />Especially interesting are charming performances by Alexis Bledel as the daughter, and Edward Herrmann as the grandfather. The series is spiced with humorous performances by Sean Gunn, as the village court jester Kirk, and Liza Weil as the hilarious best friend, Paris Geller.
B001U7FWM8|5.0|In the three years following Grizzly Bear's full-band debut, Yellow House, Edward Droste and company didn't exactly take great pains to keep the details of their new record a secret. And we, the indie faithful, paid very close attention. We read Stereogum and Pitchfork, lingered on Droste's modest eloquence when he granted interviews to a smattering of publications. We learned that the record was conceived and written at the famous Glen Tonche estate in upstate New York, recorded at Droste's grandmother's home off Cape Cod, and completed in a church in New York City. We learned that the songs were written by all four members--Droste (guitar), Daniel Rossen (guitar), Christopher Bear (drums) and Chris Taylor (bass/woodwinds/electronics)--instead of Droste and Rossen only. We learned that Nico Muhly would provide string arrangements on several tracks, and that Beach House's Victoria Legrand would sing on one (\\"Two Weeks\\"). We breathed a sigh of relief when \\"Cheerleader\\", an album track released earlier in the year, didn't let us down. Some of us even managed to hear an awful quality rip of the record months prior to its release, although this was certainly not the band's intention. It's almost as if Veckatimest came, saw, conquered and peaced out before stores even began to sell it.<br /><br />And yet, few of us could have expected something as flat-out wonderful as this. Veckatimest doesn't call attention to itself and seems humbled in the manner of groups with far fewer personnel who play at a far lower volume. But at this point in history we'd be idiots to think that modesty can keep brilliant songwriters from vaulting to the head of the class, and Grizzly Bear have quietly produced a standout, both in their own catalogue and in 2009. They've done it, presumably, by taking their months in abeyance to focus on what's worked for them and what has not, and then tweaking the nuts and bolts of their design accordingly. We often wish for our cherished bands to grow and develop between releases (having our cake), but we also want them to retain their essence and a sense of their own identity in the metamorphosis (eating it, too). Grizzly Bear answer our call by resisting any urges to record Yellow Duplex as they resurface with a fully formed work of art only they could have engendered.<br /><br />It's somewhat ironic that on the group's most refined record, the one thing that hasn't changed is Yellow House`s iffiest element. That would be the sound quality, whose musty, shopworn timbre had several otherwise laudatory critics (e.g., Mark Richardson) straddling the fence. I can see where they're coming from. If the willfully low fidelity lent Yellow House the air of a time capsule, unearthed and played on the Victrola for the first time in decades, it also failed to flatter the instrumentation and complex melodies winding through the disc. I'd go a step further and say that it aided the process of weighing down the hooks, many of which were quite heavy anyway. But Veckatimest is a much more aerated and chromatically varied record by nature, and the levity gives the band's prototypical sound an entirely new definition. In this context, it's no longer rough and grizzled but shimmering and bright, fluttering with the most subdued of vibrations. The sound may have deadened Yellow House a bit, but it causes Veckatimest to feel utterly alive, all of the time.<br /><br />Whether it was planned from the beginning or just a serendipitous coincidence, I can't think of a better time for Warp to release Veckatimest than on the cusp between spring and summer, when things often go from good to excellent and people's sense of their own aliveness peaks. The trio of leadoff tracks references travel and beating inertia, lyrically and musically. Over dusty, rolling acoustic guitars and a rhythmic cadence that reminds me of a horse's quick trot, Droste sings the album's first words in an auspicious tone: \\"Our haven on the southern point is calling us / And faced with all the obvious, so carry us.\\" In the thunderous chorus, it appears he's already made it there: \\"You'll never find me now.\\" We believe him because the song he's offered us--a five-minute pop number with propulsive momentum and an aura of optimism--makes it difficult to find his old band anywhere inside of it. \\"Two Weeks\\" springs out into daylight like a recuperated kid after two weeks of bed rest, its boogie-woogie piano and vocal exultations of \\"OH-oh, OH-oh, WHOA-oh!\\" sporting confidence and resoluteness. What is it they ask for on the third track, \\"All We Ask\\"? \\"Another voice / Lead us on, lead us on.\\"<br /><br />There's a clear desire for new energy here, and they've found it, in part, by pulling all four heads together during conception and welcoming the panoply of ideas that came forth. As a result, Veckatimest is an embarrassment of riches. Scores of countermelodies are assimilated into the overall tableaus, enhancing their musicality without distracting from their main ideas. (Credit the sound quality for this, too; its fuzzy texture blurs the lines between individual instruments and leaves a singular entity in their place.) The technique works as well on a grabber like \\"Two Weeks\\" as it does on the less immediate \\"Cheerleader\\", which reaches back to a fading glitzy nostalgia with swaying rhythms, American Bandstand guitars, Muhly's wonderfully sappy strings and Droste's falsetto that lingers in the air long after the track ends. \\"I Live With You\\" is by turns intimate and effulgent, starting as a crumbly, one-chord strum that unwittingly picks up a choir, a brass section, woodwinds, and as many electronic effects as there are buttons to push on the keyboard.  Yet the band sounds just as secure when they aren't filling in the entire canvas, as on the sweet \\"Hold Still\\", where Droste sings over guitar ambience and a memorable plucked riff that float up and disappear into the campfire-lit night sky.<br /><br />In contrast to Veckatimest`s beginning, and indeed to Yellow House, these more hushed songs have a relationship to travel and domesticity that isn't easy to explain. To my ears they have a preoccupation with physical space; as they expand and shrink back, the group seems to be aware of how much room is available to occupy. They don't feel particularly housebound either, but when they take flight they remain connected to the earth and in the realm of the corporeal. On \\"Dory\\", the protagonist imagines himself and a companion swimming \\"like two dories let loose in the bay,\\" though the song appears to exist on the front porch of a summer hideout during the imagination stage, rather than on the water. Yet the air is still fresh, the scenery unique. In this regard, Veckatimest and Beach House's similarly toned Devotion (2008) strike me as two sides of the same coin. The journeys we took on Devotion were too starry and idealistic to be true, as if we dreamed them up from the safety of our bedrooms. Veckatimest moves us around the sylvan American landscape in search of comfortable places to settle down.<br /><br />Grizzly Bear have always possessed this je ne sais quoi way of making their music sound as old as the animal that shares their namesake. But on this, their finest record, they've joined their contemporaries in Fleet Foxes by casting oldness in a new light. Although it's rooted in contemporary rock, Veckatimest is essentially era-less, inspired less by the specific music of their forebears and more by the wistfulness and sentimentality that enshroud it. As such, the band has succeeded in overturning the common assumption--held by the youth of this generation, who are the ones most likely to listen to this--that anything too old is bound to be frumpy and staid. But even more significant is that Veckatimest proves that a record doesn't have to carry so much darn weight to still feel important. The band has swapped out the six-minute epics of Yellow House for a greater number of shorter works, packed with just as many concepts but integrated with more skill and with more respect for the pieces as holistic edifices containing a single incredible idea at each of their centers. In the process, they've written their most instantly memorable songs to date.  All bets aren't necessarily off in terms of whether or not Grizzly Bear have hit their plateau--recall that we did this with Yellow House in 2006; oops--but it's hard to imagine them giving us more to enjoy in one sweeping statement than they have here.<br /><br />(This was published in PopMatters on 5/26/09)re hushed songs have a relationship to travel and domesticity that isn't easy to explain.

B000W4HIX6|3.0|I don't feel that I need to say much about the movie -- many others have given excellent reviews.  Suffice it to say that I love this movie and have watched it time and time again.<br /><br />Where I'm disappointed is with the Blu-Ray release.  This picture is nice and crisp, but the high-definition transfer seems substandard, with colors washed out in places.  This might be due to the age of the materials used in the transfer, but that's just speculation.<br /><br />A bigger disappointment was the lack of bonus features.  There are a few bonus items on the disc (most totally uninteresting), while on the DVD special edition there are quite a few more special features.  Blu-Ray discs are supposed to have so much more capacity for data storage that it surprised me that ALL of the bonus features from the DVD were not included.  This mean I have to keep my DVD copy if I want to have access to all the special features.  This is very feeble thinking on the part of the 20th Century Fox, as it makes me less likely to grab a Blu-Ray version of something in the future.

B001PA0FFO|3.0|Doubt flet like a train wreck running in super slow motion. Within the first few moments it is clear what the story is about and, there is no doubt about what will happen. The only glimmer of doubt was how explicit would the director be in describing or showing what happened.<br /><br />Details unfolded so slowly. This felt like a movies from the 20's or 30's or a Victorian novel. There was a different viewer dynamic; the director expected people to catch on slowly and fed the plot to the audience crumb by crumb.<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffman and Meryl Streep are amazing actors. Mr. Hoffman is one of my favorites. He is very consistent with the role of Father Flynn. Meryl Streep on the other hand, gains and loses that New Jersey / Irish accent frequently throughout this movie. It's sad that Ms. Streep has never been able to maintain a single accent through a movie (Sophie's Choice the most notable). She is a powerful actress, and sometimes that minor inability can be overlooked with her performances. Amy Adams is sweet, and innocent as Sister James. It's a decent performance.<br /><br />I am very sorry for being critical of this film. It really did not connect at all for me. The film is one hour and 45 minutes long. It is almost 45 too long. I think the real downfall was a poor script. Converting a play into a feature length film is a difficult process, what works on the stage rarely works on film; and vice versa. It seems the writer was just not up to the task. I know the Academy loved this film, and it has won many awards.<br /><br />At a certain point, I also didn't much care what happened to any of the characters. The film did not develop a compasion or connection for any of the characters. We know, or think we know, what the priest did; so he is reprehensible. In fact the director makes him all the more awful with the drunken dinner scene juxtaposed against the Nun's serene silent meals. The principal was constantly remprimanding every child in the school; so no love there. The children all seemed to just float along however the wind was blowing. One would act up, another would be good, another would be a teacher's pet... but no real deep character development. Even Donald Miller, the child that is supposed to have been abused, we don't get anywhere near how he feels about things. The children are all just colors in some kind of flat painting. We develop some like or attachment to Sister James, but because she's having trouble with her class; or tormented about what she may or may not have seen. But she's not the central character of the film. I didn't care much of what happened to anyone in the film.<br /><br />Technically, it's a decent job. There are about 6 angled shots where the camera is tilted 45 degrees for no particular reason. The tilt makes no sense at all. The sound was fairly flat. Thunder was about the only thing that delivered surround sound. The rest was all stuck in the front two channels. Dialog was clear. Pacing, this film is all over the map. There are so many framing errors and nonsense shots. It almost seems like they got the film in the can and then had to reshoot aimlessly.<br /><br />So no, can't really recommend this one too highly. If somebody has no idea about the Catholic Church scandals, then maybe they would appreciate this film. Or the true Seymour Hoffman or Streep fanboy will have to watch this.so no love there.

0743277708|5.0|Watership Down was the first \\"big\\" book I ever read. The synopsis on the cover was intriguing and the story was engrossing. I found myself drawn in to the life of a group of rabbits who experienced all manner of danger and adventure after their brave departure from a comfortable rabbit warren. I remember feeling a sense of loss after the story came to a close and I could no longer read the further experiences of the rabbits --beings who I felt I had come to know as well as siblings. The descriptions of rabbit behavior (and other animals) on the beautiful English countryside setting were realistic and simple at the same time. I often recalled fondly the copy I'd found at the library as a child and imagined that I'd read it to my children in later years. After reading the Harry Potter series to my children, they asked what we could read now that it had ended. I immediately thought about Watership Down. I searched for and purchased it online twenty + years after first reading it and have now been able to share this wonderful story with my children.

B001AQMBJQ|5.0|Season Five of LOST was the first that provided more answers than questions. The first four seasons had raised questions at an extraordinary pace, providing the occasional answer. But while the end of Season Five raised a couple of massive questions of huge cliffhanger proportions, we nonetheless got more of a sense of what is going on with the island, its inhabitants, and its visitors than ever before. There are still some major unanswered questions, like the origin of the island and what the deal with Richard Alpert (the ageless wonder) is and who built the statue (and what brought it down), but we still are getting an overall picture of things.<br /><br />What held true of LOST after Season One holds true of the show after Season Five: whether this turns out to be a great show depends on how well they manage to wrap up the overall story line. There have been very, very few shows in the history of television that have set out, from the very beginning, to tell a self-contained story with a beginning, middle, and an end. BATTLESTAR GALACTICA (the new one, not the old one) was one. BABYLON 5 was another. Many other shows have more or less ended up telling a story, but in a way that wasn't crucial to the structure of the series. This was even true of a show like ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT. But for shows like LOST and BSG, our ultimate judgment will hinge on how well all the loose ends are wrapped up at the end. The final answers will have a retroactive effect on the rest of the series. If we are left at the end feeling that the secrets of the island have not been adequately answered, this will undercut all that went before. If we don't accept the way the stories of the characters are resolved, it will weaken the series as a whole. I loved the way that BSG ended (though I'll grant that not everyone did) and I fully hope that LOST will end similarly well. We've gotten five great seasons and I doubt that Damon Lindelhof and Carlton Cuse will suddenly lose their ability to tell a great story. Plus, they will continue to be assisted by some great writers like Drew Goddard and Elizabeth Sarnoff and Brian K. Vaughan (who got a great shout out this season when Hurley is seen reading in Spanish one of the volumes of Y: THE LAST MAN, the famous graphic series written by Vaughan).<br /><br />Season Five began with the survivors of Oceanic 815 and their various allies split into two groups. The Oceanic Six are back in the real world, but Jack and Ben are determined to lead them all back to the island. The rest back on the island - at least those that are still alive, most having died - have, like Billy Pilgrim in Kurt Vonnegut's SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE, become unstuck in time. They find themselves moving from one year or decade - heck, from one century - to another. And when the Oceanic Six return, they find themselves stranded in a different time themselves, back in the seventies with the Dharma Initiative and the Others. Most poignantly, Sun has found out that Jin is till alive, but they are stuck thirty years apart.<br /><br />But this wouldn't be LOST without a host of twists and turns. We are barraged (in a good way) with a never-ending string of shocks and surprises. Things constantly turn out not to be what we expect. That is especially true of John Locke, but true of just about everyone else as well. The amount of detail is almost overwhelming, though in a good way. It keeps the show fascinating and ever fresh. And of course, this being LOST, there are a host of deaths. The only series with a larger body count is BSG.<br /><br />The best thing about Season Five of LOST is that it continues the excellent pacing that was established after the Season Three hiatus. I'm sure everyone will recall that fans were outraged and disappointed after the first six episodes of Season Three, which were broadcast a few months before the show resumed in the winter. Fans felt that the show was dragging, as if they were trying to stretch the series out an extraseason or two instead of getting on with the story. When the show resumed, the producers responded to the fans' complaints and significantly stepped up the pace of the storytelling. By the end of that season it felt like a new and completely refreshed show. And Seasons Four and Five have maintained that pace. One thing that definitely helped them maintain the pace was the announcement at the end of Season three that the show would end after Season Six.<br /><br />And so we come to the beginning of the end. For five seasons LOST has been one of the most intense, involving shows on television. I'm already starting to get sad about its end. I still haven't quite recovered from BATTLESTAR GALACTICA ending this spring and now LOST ends next spring. It has been a great story from the very beginning and we can only hope that things remain just as good as they have been.ting on with the story.

1402217722|4.0|I love this author! Georgette Heyer has been around for a very long time, yet with the reissue of her many novels she is attracting a new generation. The Convenient Marriage is my third Heyer, and second romance that I have read of hers. The blurb above really tells the gist of the story, so I am not going to reiterate it here; with all the the simplistic and predictable events we still get pulled in a fantastic way. It is full of quaint scenes and fun romance set in earlier times, in Jane Austen fashion, but what I enjoy the most is the fact I find myself grinning to myself as I read her books. The Convenient Marriage is no exception to the grinning, sometimes it is laugh out loud funny with the hi-jinks of the heroine and her brother and his bosom buddies. There is a slew of interesting characters with Horry and her sisters and of course the obligatory numbskull character Mr Drelincourt who is upset the Earl of Rule has decided to marry after all these years which puts him further down the line in the inheritance.<br /><br />Here is a fun teaser from the book:<br />p. 164:<br />\\"While the waiting -woman collected her scattered jewels and garments she sipped the chocolate, pondering her problem. What had seemed a mere prank twelve hours earlier had by now assumed gigantic proportions. There was first the episode of the curl.\\"<br /><br />Horatia is stuttering fool, her brother is a drunk gambler, and the older man she married is besotted with her yet she is too immature to realize it. Her new husband, The Earl of Rule, is portrayed as a doting and tolerant man with none of the typical 'rake' or roguish ways so typical of a Heyer romance. This romance is complete with a sword fight, kidnapping, parties and pinching diamond shoes. Since this is actually one of Heyer's earlier romances from 1936 she was still honing her writing skill and perhaps had not perfected the Heyer Genre as this is not one of her most popular books. I admit that it was a teensy bit slow in one or two parts but I really did enjoy the comical aspect of it and I do not hesitate to recommend this to anyone interested in the Jane Austen/Regency Romance genre. To try and explain the scrapes that the characters got into reminds me a lot of the Three Stooges with a leg up on the intelligence factor, and this book is the epitome of a comically charming period romance.lly did enjoy the comical aspect of it and I do not hesitate to recommend this to anyone interested in the Jane Austen/Regency Romance genre.

B00003CXTG|5.0|The process of buying the DVD went very smoothly.  I knew what I wanted, found it at a great price, and purchased it.  I received the product in a timely manner and it was in great shape.
0061689246|5.0|I absolutely love this book.  I'm a huge fan of Neil Gaiman and really liked Anansi Boys and American Gods, but Stardust is now my favorite.  It has a typical fairy tale plot but told in a much more sophisticated and magical way.  I love the magical fairie world that Gaiman creates in this book. This book is sexy, dark, mysterious and fast paced.  It also has just a touch of that dark humor that British writers are so good at.<br /><br />I loved the characters so much I will probably read this book again.
0765340798|1.0|Like several other reviews for this product, this review is more a review for the entire trilogy than for the Battle of Corrin in particular.     I like the Dune series a lot. The first book by Frank Herbert is one of the greatest sci-fi/fantasy novels of all time. I say \\"fantasy\\" because as a work of \\"soft\\" sci-fi, Dune displays many characteristics of fantasy.     Although I contend that Frank Herbert never managed to recapture the greatness of the original in the later books, there is no doubt that he was a tremendously intelligent and skilled writer. His talent still shines in Dune Messiah through Chapterhouse.     The Butlerian Jihad had a lot of potential to be made into a great story. I do not pretend to know how Frank Herbert would have handled this subject matter if at all so I'll try to critique this series on its own merits. Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson are NOT good writers. The writing throughout this trilogy is very, very bland. The characters are numerous but the characterisation falls flat (in part because of a very detached narrative style that doesn't allow the reader to peer into the characters' heads).     Besides being boring, the writing also comes off as lazy. The authors use vague adjectives rather than vivid imagery. They use too many similes that start with \\"like...\\" I felt that certain descriptions that would have been interesting to the reader if done in-depth were glossed over because an in-depth job would have required more effort. There are also a number of questionable plot elements. Omnius, a supreme AI that exists thousands of years in the future, is more an example of artificial stupidity than anything else. Instead of being a sprawling, non-tangible network, Omnius conveniently has a nexus housed in a few buildings ready to be blown up. Humans employ swordmasters who use \\"pulse swords\\" (the weapons are only vaguely described) to fight war mechs in melee combat. Even assuming that the robots are not armed with rapid-fire ranged weaponry, this idea is just plain idiotic. Sadly a number of scenes from the series are corny or unintentionally funny, a few examples: the way Vorian kills Agamemnon undermines the latter's status as the leader of the \\"Titans\\" (who might as well be re-named the Morons). The death of Beowulf is similarly comical. Xavier and Serena's outdoor love scene is weird and unneccessary, etc.     I give the series one star because Amazon doesn't allow 0 stars and because it might provide popcorn entertainment to some readers (though I personally found the series to be terribly boring).
1401219268|5.0|Alan Moore's Watchmen is a fantastic graphic novel, and I was amazed constantly throughout on the level of detail, not only in an artistic sense, but also with plot. Moore's masterpiece and definately a must have for any literary connoisseur. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel and would reccomend it to anyone.<br />Many regard this novel as bleak, and dark. Perhaps it is, but I wouldn't have it any other way. The characters in this story are better than any I have had any experience with. You care about them. You grow attatched to them throughout the story. What I love most is how the costumed heroes are supposed to be just that -- heroes, but in reality they are mostly bad people. It's not your typical superhero story, and that's what I love about it. It's different, it's original. Breathes new life into the typical superhero formula.<br />Get this novel. I promise, you won't regret it.
B000ZMVAXO|5.0|So easy to use, so simple, and sooooooooooo rich in sound quality I usually record the tone that it has.
1439102813|5.0|This book was very well written and a wonderful read.  My mother suffers from Alzheimer's and I only wish I had this to read earlier in her illness.  I think the speech Alice gives in the story says it all.  I don't want to spoil this for anyone but would encourage you to share this story with someone who has found out they have a family member with Alzheimer's.  It will help them to see how the illness progresses and a an understanding from the perspective of the person with the illness.  A caution - when the doctors give Alice the tests you find yourself testing your own memory. My sister and I both laughed at ourselves over that.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a truly fascinating DVD series for all ages.  Planet Earth is so astonishing and the BBC series narrated by David Attenborough goes a long way in showing us with amazing clarity and beauty just how special is the planet on which we live.  I highly recommend this series for anyone from age 4 to 94.  The indepth information and fantastic photography is unparalleled.  Every science class and school from Grade 1 to 12 should see this wonderful series.
0312360266|4.0|Marked was a book that took me awhile to read. I had to make myself keep reading until I got to about the 15th chapter then I couldn't stop reading.<br /><br />Zoey Redbird is a 16 year old girl. She has seen the vampyre tracker around school for a few days until she actually sees him standing at her locker... she wonders what he is doing there yet it is very easy for the reader to predict what will happen next. A few days later Zoey is settled into her new life, and lifestyle. She is going to school at the House of Night, and actually goes to school at night. She has made new friends, yet she is completely different to the rest of the young fledglings attending this school. She is different because her mark is filled in. The author doesn't specifically say what the other fledglings' marks look like but we can infer that they are different from Zoey's. Zoey has many more challenges to face in her new life including new classes, new people, and new boys.<br /><br />This is a book I will definitely recommend to my friends and family who I think will enjoy it. For example if you are a `Twilight' fanatic and you think no other author has a say on what or how vampires live you don't want to read this book, but if you are open to other authors and looking for other interesting books on this subject I definitely recommend this book. I will definitely be reading the next books in the series and I look forward to seeing what happens to Zoey and how her powers either help or hinder her.
B000EPR7NE|4.0|I am partial because I have been a fan of Hans Zimmer for some time (since about Thelma and Louise) and he has outdone himself with Da Vinci Code.  The film was pretty good and met with mixed reviews.  I liked it very much and part of the reason was the stirring music which added life to the story.  There are few passages as beautiful as towards the closing when the 'realization' sets in.  (I will not ruin the ending).  Beautiful choral passages throughout provide the perfect atmosphere for the controversial story. One of my favorite scores of all time.
B001PPLIEG|4.0|enjoyed the movie very much lots of action and suspense with good twist to wrap up loose ends from Casino Royale recommended worth watching
B001U0HBPG|4.0|David Fincher's film that follows Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt), a man who was born in his 80s and continually grows younger, is one of three my favorite movies from last year along with Gran Torino and Synecdoche, New York. Now when I think of it, all three movies have in common the theme of aging, loss, memory, inevitable death and dealing with it. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is the most technically accomplished, refined, and cinematically stunning of the three. It is based on the F. Scott Fitzgerald's short and little known story but it only has in common with the story the title, the main idea, and I believe as a tribute to Fitzgerald's more famous work, the name of Benjamin Button's eternal love, Daisy who was played amazingly by Cate Blanchett. The story in the film is Eric Roth (Oscar nominated script) through and through and it is obvious that he used the same approach and the same device as in his Oscar winning script for Forrest Gump. Does it make BB a bad movie? Most definitely, no. Even if it easy to spot the similarities, BB is a fantastic movie on its own merits. It is a work of art for all its duration. It is a moving dramatic story of love, longing, and losses of one ordinary man with the extraordinary condition. Yes, the film is long and it does not rush. But the film of such beauty can and must be enjoyed even if or when the story would stall for a while. The performances, the virtuoso directing by David Fincher, the incredible flawless work by the teams of make-up artists, visual effects specialists, and by the specialists in Art Direction departments have surpassed any and all possible expectations and achieved an incredible result. According to my rule of thumb, any film with Cate Blanchett is worth watching. I've been her fan for years, and I love her as the actress and admire her as a person and the most beautiful woman in the world. Her work in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button with Brad Pitt belongs to the best screen romances ever and if anything, the film will be remembered for some of the most beautiful and memorable romantic scenes ever filmed. The night scene in NYC with the silhouette of dancing Cate has entered my personal vault of the most beloved film treasures. I loved the film. I know it may not be perfect story-wise but I don't care. There is much more to it than the story.<br /><br />4.5/5nd if anything, the film will be remembered for some of the most beautiful and memorable romantic scenes ever filmed.

B000002G0P|4.0|Boston's Extreme would hit their artistic peak with release of `III Sides to Every Story' but unfortunately not all great art is appreciated commercially. The album dropped in sales compared to its predecessor which sold double platinum on the strength of hit singles. `III Sides' doesn't take the easy way out and while though it does have songs which should have dented the singles market, the band was not aiming for low brow but high concept.  As grunge was hitting the marketplace by mid-1992, metal bands who presented progressive concept albums were in danger of suffering the slings and arrows of both critics and fickle fans. The LP is divided into three parts (hence three sides) \\"Yours\\", a hard rocking album more in the `Pornograffitti' vane, \\"Mine\\", featuring the mellower more introspective side of the band and \\"The Truth\\" which is truly the most progressive of the three parts and featured longer songs with multi-parts and orchestration while built around a general theme of \\"Everything Under the Sun\\". With patience and persistence, `III Sides' is how Extreme envisioned their fans would eventually accept their high minded concepts; addressing religion but also war, politics, racism, failed romance ,tabloid journalism and parental love. \\"Rest in Peace\\", \\"Tragic Comic\\", \\"Am I Ever Gonna Change\\", \\"Warheads\\", \\"Peacemaker Die\\" and \\"Stop the World\\" are all career highlights. Extreme sought to emulate their heroes on `III Sides' and based on what I hear, they measure up quite well.

0385473788|5.0|Anne's story has made an indelible impact on me and helped me see more clearly into both the loveliest and the most despicable parts of human nature. Her writing has opened my heart to love more deeply and my mind to think more critically.<br /><br />Anne Frank started her journal on her 13th birthday, in 1942. Her father, Otto Frank, had moved his family to Amsterdam in 1933 to avoid the Nazi rise to power, but in 1940, Hitler invaded The Netherlands, thus trapping the family there. As sanctions against the Jews became stricter, Otto went in hiding with his family into \\"the secret annex\\", an assortment of hidden rooms in his office building where he had been manager. About this same time in 1942, Anne received her journal and began recording her thoughts, feelings, and daily activities to chronicle their existence. Anne had a gift for words, and her writing contains conceptualizations about her experiences and the war that are powerful and thought-provoking. Even more, she possessed empathy, courage, faith, and determination that inspires and motivates. Thus, her journal is not only a suburb retelling of events but a powerful statement about the capacity of a human's capacity to love in the midst of fear.<br /><br />On August 04, 1944, following a tip, the German Security Police discovered the secret annex, took the inhabitant to the Gestapo, then a few days later stuffed them into a train with hundreds of other Jews and carted them off to hard labor at Auschwitz concentration camp. Anne, of course, was separated from her parents. She soon became weak from malnourishment and sickness. Just a few months before her 16th birthday and a month before the liberation, Anne died in the concentration camp. In fact, everyone in her family (her sister and mother) died during those months except for Anne's father, whom she loved most dearly.<br /><br />My mind keeps returning to that horrible car drive to the Gestapo and the thoughts that must have raced through Anne's mind. Imagine the beating of young Anne's heart and the sick feeling in her stomach as she sits on those horrible aluminum seats awaiting her fate. Imagine the German military officer standing guard in the corner as armbands of death are stapled around the arms of the quiet family. His eyes keep finding the ground but he cannot avoid their eyes when he looks up.<br /><br />Why do you avoid their eyes, young officer? Is it to avoid seeing a girl, just a girl, who had but one wish: to live and love, and in so doing, make an impact in this world for good? Why do you avoid the eyes of her father? You can see that he stares at his daughter with such love, such desire to protect...Are you afraid that looking into his eyes you might think of your own father and his love for you? Do you suddenly glimpse - as though reflected in a mirror - your own frail arm outstretched to receive the sentence of death as your father and mother watch helplessly? May your mind never find peace in your soul until you ask forgiveness from God Almighty and from the Jewish people for your part in this crime you now commit.<br /><br />They must have all known in the depths of their hearts they were sending humans, lovely human beings, to a horrible fate. And yet a whole government was compelled to follow, follow, follow - that awful, insidious coaxing of Hitler as he beat a death drum to the near-annihilation of an entire race of people.<br /><br />How very important it is that absolute principles of the value and dignity of the human race are written into the constitution of every government's code. Moral principles of mutual respect and responsibility must be upheld and valued as the highest law. Because all it takes is one man, an autocrat like Hitler, to compel his government to follow him and soon the whole country will be following, their moral compass disoriented by the magnetism of the mighty. It's written into our nature.<br /><br />It takes a voice like Anne's, one whose self-honesty and examination allow her to see herself and others clearly, to inspire the rest of us to uphold the right of everyone to experience peace, freedom, and happiness.<br /><br />To conclude, here's a poem by Barbara Sonek called \\"Holocaust\\". Remember the Holocaust and learn from it.<br /><br />We played, we laughed<br />We were loved.<br />We were ripped from the arms of our<br />Parents and thrown into the fire.<br />We were nothing more than children.<br />We had a future. We were going to be<br />Lawyers, rabbis, wives, teachers, mothers.<br />We had dreams, then we had no hope.<br />We were taken away in the dead of night<br />Like cattle in cars, no air to breathe<br />Smothering, crying, starving, dying.<br />Separated from the world to be no more.<br />From the ashes, hear our plea.<br />This atrocity to mankind can not happen again.<br />Remember us, for we were the children<br />whose dreams and lives were stolen away.nation allow her to see herself and others clearly, to inspire the rest of us to uphold the right of everyone to experience peace, freedom, and happiness.<br /><br />To conclude, here's a poem by Barbara Sonek called \\"Holocaust\\".

B001TH16DI|4.0|I really enjoyed watching the set over the weekend on my 61\\" DLP set.  All the complaining by people long before this set was released was much ado about nothing.    In fact, by my eye, the one movie that went through a heavy digital restoring...Star Trek II...looks the worst of the bunch.  Faces are often over-saturated and look colorized.  Some shots are sharp, where others have a softer focus.  You can easily pick out the voice overdubs vs dialogue shot in the scene.  The movie flickers in places the same way it has in every other release.  But most of those examples were really flaws of the original production, so what can you do.    Star Trek VI is just the opposite.  Beautiful, clear, with an awesome soundtrack.  VI was the only movie of the bunch to get a theatrical Dolby Digital 5.1 mix (though it was only used for showcases of the then-new technology).    But for the most part, all six movies look pretty much the way I remember them in their original theatrical runs.  They're not overly sharp and they come from clean sources.  You might see the occasional flaw here and there, but that's what they looked like on the big screen.  Which is how it should be.      If they re-released them again tomorrow with all new digital transferring, I would feel no urge to buy them at all.  I have them the way I want them right now.
B001BWQVSG|5.0|All fans know these widely available recordings. My personal favorites are Liszt Sonata, Chopin 3rd sonata and the Bach cd - all tour de force of piano playing, very hot-headed, dangerous readings of these works. Try Finale of Chopin sonata to taste. The set is tightly packed box, cardboard sleeves with reproductions of original LPs: so nostalgic. Also the short LP playing times are there. The price is very good, but I would have liked better photo quality of \\"mini-LPs\\", they have a bit feeling of copies made in haste. A little bit more sharpness and color balance would be nice...perhaps for The collection 2, DGG? There were also small cardboard \\"sticks\\" in some cd surfaces (perhaps result of cutting process of the sleeves), be sure to wipe them off before enter cd to player. The set also contain a nice leaflet with good photos, but not on the best paper, though. But now to the point - this is 5 stars collection by its musical contents, bringing together Complete Solo Argerich on DGG, in easy and nice format. Recommended for old and new fans alike!
B001QOOCTE|5.0|Musicians from all across the world have united to deliver one message -- peace.  And do they ever deliver.  If you love world fusion music, you're going to be in heaven or nirvana or Valhalla when you're listening to this CD.  Surprises abound from a reggae song with a didgeridoo.  The DVD is definitely worth buying if nothing else for the scenery alone.  This is a lovingly crafted collection for a great cause and is in this reviewer's opinion, one of the top disks of 2009.     Rebecca Kyle, May 2009
B001U7FWM8|5.0|I was I admit tempted to seek out one of the early copies of this album which were circulating pre-release. I am glad I didn't not least of all since Veckatimest is beautifully produced and packaged even on a download from I Tunes. Some of it has been well trailed around the music blogs and the band has put in some great appearances on Letterman and BBC's Jools Holland. The lead singer of the Fleet Foxes has described it as the album of the decade and Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood has described Grizzly Bear as his favourite band. So finally we can judge whether its deserves the anticipation and hype or will it just collapse under the weight of all this expectation?<br /><br />Based on the huge promise of the wonderful Yellow House particularly with superb songs like \\"The Knife\\" \\"Central and remote\\" \\"Colorado\\" and the brilliant \\"On a neck and a spit\\" it is clear that Grizzly Bear have originality & inventiveness in spades particularly in their dream like capacity to mix a vast range of influences but somehow make them sound totally unique and cool. Check out their cover version of Paul Simon's \\"Mother and Child Reunion\\" to hear a song fundamentally deconstructed and rebuilt so differently that it could sit on the \\"Twin Peaks\\" soundtrack! Indeed \\"too clever by half\\" has been one charge levelled at them. This has led the recent reviewer of Veckatimest in The Times to question whether \\"there is a word for an album that you know is excellent, but that you really don't want to listen to\\"? Challenging\\" doesn't quite do it, because Veckatimest features some lovely tunes -- but, my God, is it hard work\\"<br /><br />Some first thoughts, I have listened to this constantly over the past two days and hard work its not, indeed it would do this album a massive disservice if it were seen as inaccessible or difficult. True there are some very dense and textured songs on here like \\"Dory\\" which is more a lush choral piece sung in a tea room as opposed to a pop song. Similarly \\"Hold still\\" is a complex soundscape underpinned by what sounds like a harp, it is also very beautiful. I suspect all these songs will richly reward with repeated listens. More straightforward (in a Grizzly Bear sense) are the brilliant \\"Two Weeks\\" possibly one of the songs of the year with Droste's superb vocals. Then there is the almost funky \\"Cheerleader\\" backed by the Brooklyn Youth choir which I can actually imagine Prince covering (nothing wrong in that). Other delights are the acoustically driven \\"About Face\\" which reminds me of some of the pastoral themes explored on Midlake's \\"Trials of the Van Occupanther\\" and the gorgeous \\"Foreground\\" which could easily sit on Mercury Rev's masterpiece \\"Deserters Songs\\". Finally \\"I live with you\\" has so much going on it's like a mini \\"White album\\".<br /><br />The great British band Roxy Music once sang about \\"modern songs for modern days\\" and here at last we have a band that is moving in fascinating and totally different territory. Indeed comparisons with the current music scene in the UK are illustrative.

Yet sadly it doesn't just wear its influences it virtually drowns in them.

I suspect all these songs will richly reward with repeated listens. More straightforward (in a Grizzly Bear sense) are the brilliant \\"Two Weeks\\" possibly one of the songs of the year with Droste's superb vocals. Then there is the almost funky \\"Cheerleader\\" backed by the Brooklyn Youth choir which I can actually imagine Prince covering (nothing wrong in that). Other delights are the acoustically driven \\"About Face\\" which reminds me of some of the pastoral themes explored on Midlake's \\"Trials of the Van Occupanther\\" and the gorgeous \\"Foreground\\" which could easily sit on Mercury Rev's masterpiece \\"Deserters Songs\\". Finally \\"I live with you\\" has so much going on it's like a mini \\"White album\\".   The great British band Roxy Music once sang about \\"modern songs for modern days\\" and here at last we have a band that is moving in fascinating and totally different territory. Indeed comparisons with the current music scene in the UK are illustrative.

B001UV6C4G|5.0|This is an excellent work of historical fiction. Set just after the end of WWII, this novel gives you an idea of what it was like to be in occupied teritory during the war.
0385340575|4.0|I really enjoyed the novel until the end. I had no problem with the plot, butt he author made some mistakes with a gun. this kind of stuff drives me nuts.      A Sig P220 is a 45 acp, not a 9mm. The P226 and P228s are 9s. Also, the Sig doesn't have a magazine disconnect safety. Some semi auto pistols will not fire if the magazine is not in the pistol. Smith and Wesson 9mm from a few years back were like this.      Stephen Hunter will always get these details right.      But I still enjoyed it and will definitely get the next one in a year or so.
1595141979|5.0|Well, all the frustration I went through with Rose in Frostbite was totally worth it to be able to get to this book. Everything feel into place and Shadow Kiss is easily the best of the first three Vampire Academy books, even as good as the first two were. Now I even understand WHY Rose can be so frustratingly hot-headed and overreact about so many things. And all the same, I love her character, which is perhaps why I had a tendency to get frustrated when she wouldn't behave the way I wanted her to.    In addition to all of that, this book was action-packed, almost from the beginning. Mead has written a breathtaking story that will keep you turning the pages until you reach the end. And in the middle of all the action, we see that Rose's romance with Dimitri may finally be heading somewhere, for a change. Lissa also works with Adrian as the two of them try to develop their \\"spirit\\" powers, causing Christian (Lissa's boyfriend) some angst, but also bringing them to new levels of importance. In fact, we see more Moroi, in general, begin developing and using their powers more, and by the end it certainly comes in handy.    But above all, the culminating battle against the Strigoi is heart-pounding and completely gripping. And while I had already realized what part of the outcome would be, it was another thing altogether to actually see it unfold. Part of me wished it could have turned out differently, but if it had, the story just wouldn't be the same. All I can say is that I cannot wait to read Blood Promise when it is out in August. Thank goodness I have so many other books to keep me occupied until then!
045122499X|5.0|Ken Follet is certain entertainment.  \\"World Without End\\" is not an exception.  It was a pleasure to re-encounter the descendents of our \\"friends\\" from the \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" on this new touching saga
B001ED7C58|4.0|I picked up the soundtrack after seeing the movie and reading all 4 books in the same weekend, so this review is from the perspective of seing the movie first, not hearing the soundtrack first.<br /><br />Because I read all the books and saw the movie in the same weekend, I didn't have time to have preconceived ideas about what music should have been in the film.  And considering I have a  preference for \\"oldies\\" of the '60s and '70s (ala Moody Blues Supertramp, Harry Chapin, etc), and was raised on and have a fondness for the '80s, (including Depeche Mode, A-Ha, Dexy's Midnight Runners, etc)...I really have no basis from which 'current' music could have been culled for the movie.<br /><br />So...having given that as my caveat...I loved the soundtrack.  The songs plucked from the movie are (for the most part) the major ones which SHOULD be on the soundtrack.  I define that as being the ones you can quickly pick out and remember what scene it was from when you hear the soundtrack after the fact.  For the most part, each song chosen fit the mood of each scene it was placed with very well.<br /><br />The only gripe I have with the soundtrack is that while I really enjoyed Rob Pattinson's \\"Never Think\\", and thought it was perfect to go with the restaurant scene as the \\"music being played in the restaurant\\" (and I like it being underproduced...I tend to prefer more 'raw' or 'unplugged' music, personally)...if they could only choose one Rob Pattinson song, I think they should have chosen the other one, instead.<br /><br />\\"Let Me Sign\\" was used in the movie overlaying the moment when Edward bit Bella to get rid of James' venom and they played the montage of memories while we waited to see if Edward could stop and if Bella would live.  I think that particular piece stands out more to me than the \\"Never Think\\" background piece from the restaurant scene.<br /><br />Due to my preference for \\"standout pieces\\" from the movie being the definition of what should go on a soundtrack, that's the only reason I give this 4 stars.  It succeeds otherwise...it just missed the boat by not including \\"Let Me Sign\\" as well.stars.  It succeeds otherwise...it just missed the boat by not including \\"Let Me Sign\\" as well.
B0000Z80HU|5.0|Great sound. A great buy for me. Unfortunately now it's out of print and will really cost you.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|The Supernatural series could have been a cheesy, episodic, throwaway series.  Thankfully, instead, this show has amazing depth of characters and storyline.  Somehow they are able to take a far-out concept (brothers hunting supernatural beings) and make it believable.  You get drawn into the dynamics of the Winchester family, the plot twists are exciting, and its always fun trying to figure out which 'side' a character is on.  Plus, the show balances out the dark themes with some excellent humor to lighten the mood, and Ackles and Padalecki show what great actors they are.  I recommend all seasons of this series.

B000W1V5VU|2.0|Once again, George Clooney and Brad Pitt combine to screw a Vegas casino, successfully, of course. But this whole enterprise is clearly now played out. Please don't let there be an Ocean's 14. The world does not need it.
B001PPLJJ0|4.0|After viewing The Reader just once, I plan on viewing it again. I found the movie spell binding.  I have always been intrigued by WWII, especially the European portion of the war and all things Germany.  As one watches the film, you enter so many different rooms of intrigue where you must absorb the facts and inferences so the plot comes together.  Even though the film deals with some very sensitive issues, they are handled so flawlessly that one finds sympathy for what should be the villian.  I recommend it to anyone who has interest in WWII and enjoys a film that usurps the primal emotions into accepted and intriguing ploys of life.
B001JNNDBA|3.0|This is an amazing movie with something for everyone.  Even if you don't get wrapped up in the mystery and go to any means necessary to decipher it, it still has a great atmosphere and is extremely well made.  Great performance, great script, great directing...  With that being said it's only an okay release.  The reason I'm saying this is because the special features are not in high def and the second disc is in fact simply the second disc from the Director's Cut release.  On the other hand this isn't a complete loss because you do get both versions on one disc so if you're someone like me who enjoys both films depending on their mood it works.  However, it's not a great transfer (although it's still better than the standard DVD release) which may matter to some. Once again, it works for me.
B001DJ69E8|5.0|Please note I'm relatively new to the category of \\"trailer music,\\" thus my reviews are based solely on my own enjoyment/experience of the product.    Firstly, I'd like to correct a couple of Amazon listing mistakes regarding this CD.  The category it's in, \\"Ireland,\\" is incorrect, as is the artist title--it's just \\"Immediate,\\" as in \\"Immediate Music,\\" NOT \\"The Immediate.\\"  Somehow this CD has gotten lumped together with an Irish band by the same name when the two are not related as far as I know.  This CD would be better placed in the soundtrack, classical, or instrumental category.    I wondered why Amazon kept recommending me this weird-looking CD called \\"Trailerhead,\\" until the \\"Trailer\\" in the title finally occurred to me and I looked into it, then promptly purchased it.  \\"Trailerhead\\" is put out by the same people who gave us Globus's \\"Epicon,\\" Imperativa Records, associated with Immediate Music, who do lots of that fantastic, dramatic music you hear in movie trailers (namely--gigantic orchestras and Latin-singing choirs)--hence the CD's title.  I was unaware when purchasing \\"Trailerhead\\" how closely it corresponds to \\"Epicon.\\"  Some of the tracks on this CD are basically shortened/edited instrumental versions of some of the \\"Epicon\\" tracks.  The corresponding tracks that I can recognize are:    Trailerhead--Epicon:    Lacrimosa Dominae--Preliator  Serenata Immortale--Orchard Of Mines  Prelude To Paradise--Prelude (On Earth As In Heaven)  Spiritus Omnia--Spiritus Khayyam  Fides En Lucius Dei--Diem Ex Dei  Shield Of Faith--Take Me Away    As already mentioned, these seem to be shortened versions of some of \\"Epicon's\\" tracks, minus vocals aside from the choir.  The rest of the tracks on \\"Trailerhead,\\" as far as I know, are original to this CD (and to the trailers/commercials they appeared in--I believe \\"Prometheus Rising\\" was recently heard in the TV commercial for the movie \\"Defiance\\").    The \\"recycled\\" music however is not a drawback in the least; fans of \\"Epicon\\" will enjoy the edited versions if only for comparison's sake, and there's plenty of other music on the CD.  The later tracks in particular, such as \\"Generations\\" and \\"Age Of Discovery,\\" have an especially epic quality and can easily be pictured in a movie soundtrack.  The only drawbacks are the short length of the CD itself (\\"Epicon\\" is much longer) and of most of its tracks; I would have preferred full-length instrumental versions of the tracks above (especially the utterly gorgeous \\"Serenata Immortale\\"), the better to correspond to their vocal versions, but this is trailer music, after all.    The recording quality of \\"Lacrimosa Dominae\\" also seems to be somewhat fuzzy, but I'm not sure on whose end the blame for that would be.    If you're a fan of \\"Epicon\\" (which has more of a focus on English-language lyrics) you should definitely love this CD.  According to Imperativa's website, they should be releasing another CD soon, by composer Larry Groupe; here's hoping it's as good as the first two are.    Other CDs you may enjoy if you enjoy \\"Trailerhead\\":    *Globus--\\"Epicon\\" (the original 2006 release featuring (Latin/Roman?) lettering on the front, not the re-release sold by Amazon, which omits certain tracks)  *E. S. Posthumus--\\"Unearthed\\" and \\"Cartographer\\"  *Nightwish--\\"Dark Passion Play\\" (two-disk set with the instrumental version)  *Hans Zimmer--\\"King Arthur,\\" \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" \\"Batman Begins,\\" and other soundtracks  *Adiemus/Karl Jenkins--\\"Songs Of Sanctuary,\\" \\"Cantata Mundi,\\" \\"Dances Of Time,\\" \\"The Eternal Knot,\\" and \\"Vocalise\\"  *Lesiem--\\"Times\\" (also released as \\"Auracle\\"), \\"Mystic Spirit Voices,\\" and \\"Illumination\\"  *Era--\\"Era,\\" \\"Era 2,\\" \\"The Mass,\\" \\"Reborn\\"
0525421033|4.0|If you are ever having a bad day or feeling sorry for yourself, you should pick up this book. Because nothing you're going through can probably measure up to what Mia endures in this story. I was both horrified, saddened, and mesmerized by it all. It's truly touching and I found myself sobbing more than once. I liked how the book flashed between present and past and Mia's thoughts and angles on everything. Very well written and creative =) Can't wait to see a movie out of this one!

B001EAWMGA|2.0|A very contrived and for the most boring entry in the Beowulf rip off collection. The movie is slow paced, the acting wooden, the monster (when it is seen), average. The \\"space man\\" among the Vikings shtick has no purpose and is only alluded too.  The plot has no twists and zero originality.  Not particularly enjoyable, but not projectile vomit inducing either. Don't bother watching till on Sci Fi repeats.

B00023B1LC|4.0|It may be Mat Damon himself.  Surely the leading man in a film of this kind is important, but at first glance, Damon has none of the obvious traits.  He isn't killer handsome.  Neither has he the body of a circus ariealist.  What he's got, it seems to me, is the ability to remind you of a younger brother who enlisted in the Navy and somehow wound up in the Seals.  Nobody had any idea.  One minute he's the hot-shot of the High School Baseball team, the next minute you're watching him get decorated dressed in whites.  You're so proud of him, even if you don't know what it is he does, precisely, and all your family loves him.    So, as I say, no International Lounge Lizard with nouveau riche tastes, or a necklace of Euro-Trash beauties around his neck.    But, when the movie begins and they haul him out of the sea, nearly dead, you see it.  And as he recovers from his wounds, it becomes clearer.  He's one of the brightest and the best; clean as a whistle, sharp as a tack.  Dad's favorite boy, memory clouded, somehow, and on a mission even he doesn't remember.  And whithout making any judgment about it, you've got a great deal invested in him; in seeming him safe and his enemies identified and routed.  Therefore, when the action begins, and it does immediately, one watches him negotiate the thorny mazes of predicaments of incredible complexity and menace, with ingenuity and dispatch.  One of the best demonhstrations of what he can do happens when he arrives in Paris, after getting his money and passports out of a Swiss bank.  ANd himself and a German girl of some sort with a car, out of the American Embassy trap.  Well, an assassion crashes into his Paris apartment before either of them can catch a breath, and there's a life and death flght which ends when the failed assassin thorws himself out of the window and dies on the sidewalk below.  That is the prelude to as brilliant and harrowing a demonstration of trick driving as I've ever seen, as Borne and the girl drive her Cooper Mini through the mazes and tangles of fast, congested Parisian traffic, followed by police cruisers and motorcycle mounted cops.  Thrilling!  And that's just the first third of the film.    Rather than describe the remainder of the story in detail, I will say, instead, that the director does not allow the project to make any fatal mistakes.  He doesn't flirt with us; doesn't try to seduce us into liking the movie with mugging or stupid action jokes.  He doesn't use kids that way.  Or animals.  Or any people.  There are no faux literary pretensions anywhere.  Although there are people of different racial and ethnic backgrounds in the film, there's no ethnic or racial humor.  There are no shameful and insincere attempts to conjure up a facile moral to the story by juggling religioius symbols.  The sexual attraction of the hero and heroine to one another isn't either lewd or tricky, but grows inevitably out of the inter-reliance that builds between them as they cling to life and avoid discovery.  What attracts her is his freshness, frankness, fearlessness and his determination to protect her from enemies that are really his alone.  Their care for each other becomes as artless and as inevitable as sunrise.    The sound track is good and the intercut POP music is as one would expect it, but the music is never distracting.    Seems to me I've watched this show 3 times now, and it looks better and better every time.  The complex entity that IDENTITY is has been handled with such deftness and skill that no shot or sequence appears to have been derived from any shot or sequence in any other film.  And the editing is flawless.  Flawless!
B001PL4HZW|4.0|I have a copy of the original CD and HAD to have a copy of this enhanced CD/DVD.  I was a little disappointed in the enhancement.  Although it had a couple of new songs, I wish it had been a complete listing of songs from the movie.  The interviews were a little tiresome, and I wanted more videos or something.  I just thought it could have been MORE. I don't have the Score CD so maybe that is the one I needed to check out.  Otherwise, it is a great CD.  I can't wait for New Moon.

0316017922|2.0|What is it about Malcolm Gladwell's little 8.5\\"x5.5\\" books that I find so annoying? Perhaps it is the packaging, or the not-so-subtle political agenda, or maybe my annoyance says more about me than his books. Either way, like his other efforts I found this at times interesting, at other times tedious, and at the end as fulfilling as a meal of sand. He tells some very interesting stories then some tediously boring stories then links them all together with speculative certainty to come back to what appears to be his main theme. That main theme seems to be some sort of muckraking about social justice but it's hard to tell. He draws the reader in well enough with what seems like a promise to unveil a grand design hiding underneath social/cultural mores. He then goes on to define culture so broadly that just about any case he wants to make comes under that umbrella. I think he's do a lot better to just adopt Wilber's integral framework and look at his own \\"revelations\\" as partial truths. I doubt that will happen because it is hard to write about integral in an 8.5\\" x 5.5.\\" book.

0385341008|5.0|This is such a delightful read.  I couldn't put it down.  The story flows seamlessly along, the characters are endearing, the writing is unself-conscious.  It's one of those books you start reading very slowly towards the end, you don't want it to stop.  Do buy this, you won't be disappointed.
0312360266|2.0|I wanted desperately to love this book.  I needed a new vampire series to hold me over while I waited for the next Vampire Academy novel to come out and I was hoping to add this series to my addiction.  While the premise and plot of this book seemed interesting, I couldn't stand the writing style.  Okay, okay, we get it...the authors are \\"down with the youth\\" and can speak just like them.  We didn't need the repetitive stupid side comments and innuendos placed in parenthesis every other sentence.  I didn't think it would bother me at first but within the first few chapters I was beginning to get a headache from constantly rolling my eyes.  It's a shame because I really liked the storyline but the writing annoyed so much I couldn't possibly put myself through that again.

1400063736|5.0|LET THE GREAT WORLD SPIN is a novel of New York City, told via ten short stories that are linked through shared characters and a connection to Philippe Petit's 1974 real-life tightrope walk between the World Trade Center's Twin Towers.    The novel's structure requires the reader to invest in a story and its characters and then seemingly begin anew with the next story. Yet soon the stories begin to interconnect, and the possibility of encountering early, beloved characters in subsequent stories -- from different perspectives and with new and satisfying revelations -- creates a strong narrative pull. McCann's fine writing develops tension, too: one story recounts Petit's wire-walk exclusively through dialogue (a phone conversation); though I knew the history and thus the outcome, still the storytelling was riveting.    These are some of the most substantial characters and stories I've encountered; I ache to revisit them, including NYC itself. Though most of the novel is set in the '70s, McCann evokes 9/11 obliquely -- my favorite passage is a now-perfect metaphor, one that didn't exist before that day: \\"She had the bluest eyes, they looked like small drops of September sky.\\" Highly recommended.    (Also recommended as a companion: the 2008 Oscar-winning documentary film, \\"Man on Wire.\\")
B001S6Y0AQ|4.0|Two discs 38 and 54 minutes each approximately.  The sound is immediate with good separation between the piano,which is crisp,the alto sax which is light and airy,and the rhythm section,which has a good deep end to it's sound.  The booklet has a number of photographs of the band and gives the background on this (at the time) monumental release.  The DVD is approximately 30 minutes in length,on the making of the album,interview with Brubeck and other footage.<br /><br />Anyone with even a passing interest in jazz will have heard either \\"Take Five\\",or this entire album.  It's certainly one of the best selling albums in the jazz field,and shows no indication of slowing down anytime soon.<br /><br />What makes this release something to purchase is the entire second cd,which is THE DAVE BRUBECK QUARTET LIVE AT NEWPORT,1961,1963 and 1964,with the same personnel who played on the original studio album.  This disc contains the usual \\"hits\\" then popular from this group,along with several other tracks.  Live this group sounds a bit more alive,and not quite as academic as they sometimes tend to sound on studio recordings.  Live,this music will put a smile on your face and set your foot to tapping.  And that's what this album is all about-great jazz played with style and fine musicianship,yet it still has that cool,yet \\"good-time\\" feel.  This album so caught the public's attention,because of a couple of popular tunes,that much of the sophisticated arranging and playing was missed by listeners.  At the time the rhythm patterns in most of the compositions were very advanced-not many had played jazz in the time signatures that Brubeck and his group did on this album.  For those who like this album,the extra disc is certainly worth owning.  Not only will you have one of the best,most popular jazz albums of all time,you'll also have some very fine live jazz,which makes this release the one to own.
0316017922|4.0|In Outliers, Malcolm explores the information he has gathered on what makes people excel.  It goes back to the age-old question from psychology - what makes people the way they are - their genetic or the environment - and the answer is both and much more.<br /><br />I couldn't help but remember a study mentioned once by Tonny Robbins, in which motivational researchers asked two brothers, one of whom has become a successful business man, and the other man alcoholic - both had a father who was an alcoholic, and both man gave the same answer \\"What else could I become with a father like that.\\"  This too may be simplistic, because we really don't have information about how they were individually treated, or any other events in their lives that influenced them to think and act in ways that shaped their life path.<br /><br />Malcolm begins with a story about a specific group of early Italian settlers in America, who despite of being overweight and eating unhealthy food, lack of exercise, smoking and other unhealthy habits, had much longer lives and better health than average Americans.  Apparently the key element that made their bodies and immune system resilient is that they lived with a sense of belonging to the close-knit community where they deeply cared for each other.<br /><br />Malcolm then proceeds with the study cases of people involved in music, sports, computers and other areas of human achievement and the conclusion is that while talent is most-certainly helpful, regardless of what talent one may have, nothing beats good old hard work. Frankly speaking, this is no groundbreaking revelation, and if you're looking for any self-help tips that you may get from this book related to what you can do to make the most out of your life, just remember the old adage - \\"follow your passion and be willing to roll up your sleeves and get your fingers dirty\\". If you want to know how many hours you need to put into your work to become a world class expert in anything - the magic number is 10,000 hours, which roughly translates into about 10 years if you're working on developing your skills 20 hours a week, 5 years if you're investing 40 hours a week, and perhaps 2.5 years if you are truly madly and deeply passionate about what you're doing and work at it 80 hours a week.<br /><br />Malcolm then continues that just because you're following your willing to follow your passion and work hard, that doesn't guarantee you'll succeed unless you have an opportunity.  Here though he brings up the element of upbringing, where the super-achievers he picked grew up in supportive environments that enabled them to put them into what they were passionate about.  This is true up to a point - it was true for Bill Gates or for Mozart, and for all practical intents or purposes, none of us will become either Bill Gates or Mozart, but each of us do have our own talents and abilities, our passions which we can develop if we are willing to put in the hours to develop them, and more importantly, from my experience, whether the opportunity is there or not - successful people create the opportunities even if they had none. I like to think of North America as a \\"land of opportunity\\" and when I compare the opportunities for success here to those in let's say Eastern Europe and never mind other impoverished countries in the world - everyone in North America should be wildly successful, but they are not.  And there are many of those who grew up in environments where they didn't have much opportunity to follow their passions and talents who came to North America and created more successful lives than those who grew up in the \\"land of opportunity\\".  Thomas Stanley explores countless stories of self-made millionaire in his book \\"The Millionaire next door\\".  These guys started from scratch.  They adopted habits, a lifestyle that enabled them to make something out of their lives.<br /><br />And then there's a famous Viktor Frankl's, a Holocaust survivor, who escaped from aconcentration camp, and who described his experience in the book \\"In Search of meaning\\".  It's not that the opportunity landed in his lap - he created it.  And on that note, I would like to mention another characteristic of exceptional people that is not mentioned in the book Outliers.  The characteristic may be an offshoot of passions, but it's having the guts to follow your heart, to do what you feel driven to do even if everyone else in the world thinks that you're crazy or that what you want may be impossible.<br /><br />It may be very interesting to read stories about the upbringing of people who had something you didn't have, but it doesn't really have any practical value - unless, perhaps you were to work with your subconscious and re-imprint your mind with all those experiences and with all that nurturing and support that would've made a dramatic change in your life, but was missing from your life while you were growing up.  Dr. Milton Erickson describes one case at great length in his book \\"The February Man\\".  Then again, hypnosis and NLP techniques for boosting one's potential and filling the gaps, are not the topic covered in this book, and may or may not be your cup of tea.<br /><br />If you are interested in modeling excellence, a more practical book would be Robert Dilts' \\"Strategies of Genius.\\" Actually, there are 3 volumes.<br /><br />The next topic covered in this book is the influence of one's IQ upon the success.  While the information provided points in the direction that one's IQ is important up to a certain point and it makes no more difference in terms of one's success in life - this issue brings to my mind the question of different kinds of IQ, of different kinds of intelligences required to excel in different areas of life, which then leads me back to the basic question of what is Malcolm's definition of \\"success\\" - since his book is a book about \\"success\\".  For some people it may be excelling in one particular area of life, while for others it may be living a fulfilling and purposeful life, and perhaps excelling in the experience of inner peace, love, joy and happiness.  Or is success here measured more by how many hearts, minds or lives you manage to stir and influence with your life ...his experience in the book \\"In Search of meaning\\".

B001NLL8LA|4.0|Finally Child is back to a Reacher novel without being so preachy and political.  Nothing to lose was a disaster and almost made me give up on trying again.  Some great plot twists and fun to puzzle out the clues along with Jack.  Of course, it is slow going with all the coffee and breakfast stops and other tiny details, but some matter later.  Lots of 1 or 2 page chapters and 'white space' but at least this story had some meat unlike Nothing to Lose. Still don't like the cheap shots at our military, but it is offset by other comments.  Overall, recommend highly to Reacher fans!
B000WPDCTE|5.0|I am a self-professed comedy hater, but I loved \\"Le Diner De Cons\\" and have watched it many times since buying it.  Sly, subtle, hilarious, outrageous, it is the perfect treat for when you find yourself in need of a funny bone tickle. Highly recommended. Great to watch with significant others and friends.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|I love the Sex and the City series and had to have them all!  Very happy with the collection.  Highly recommend!
0060392886|5.0|again, having dealt with this seller, they alway deliver just what they advertise..    The book falls is honest, entertaining, and sometimes brutal...  The boys from motley crue deinately grew up the hard way, had sometimes too much fun and too much pain doing it.  Its easy to see how theyre music and legacy live on & why fans still adore them.
B001O2ZW1A|4.0|As a Porcupine Tree fan I was pleased with this solo effort by Steven Wilson.  Not as consistent as PT releases, it had some interesting tracks that grow on you after repeated listenings..
B000K7VHLY|5.0|When you are growing up, all you hear about is Romeo and Juliet. You've watched spoofs in your favorite cartoons, heard people quote it,and you get a picture of this epic romance that sweeps you off your feet. When you get to read it in high school, \\"Man, now I get to see what all the hype is about.\\" Then you open the book and you see these lines:  \\"Gregory, on my word we'll not carry coals.\\"  \\"No for then we should be Colliers.\\"     And if you were like me you said \\"What the hell are they talking about? This isn't as good as all the hype it gets!\\" But when you watch this movie it turns that story into the epic romance that everyone says it is, and probably what you thought it was before you read it. That, and the new setting and actors takes some of the cheesiness away from those cliched lines. Let's face it, \\" ... and Juliet is the sun.\\" has way more impact when Leo DiCaprio says it, than when you read it. Also the lines are the same, but easier to interpret when in a modern setting.       I'm not saying that the Zeffirelli version is bad or anything, but it can get slow at some points, and because of the medieval setting it doesn't make the lines much easier. That, and an interesting costume design for the guys in that movie seems to involve cups that they wear on the outside of their pants. It makes it kinda hard to take seriously. But it is still a great movie! Don't get me wrong!      That and It has a stuck-in-your-head soundtrack that adds a whole new level to the movie. It also has a cool, artsy vibe to it that can seem overdone to some, or original to others. I didn't even like this story for a while, but now I want to read Romeo and Juliet again, with a better understanding of the lines.       I just wanted to mention some of my favorite moments and ones to look out for. The actor who plays Mercutio (even in all his ridiculous cross-dressing scenes) still gives me chills during his eerie Queen Mab where he almost seems psychotic, but it captures yourattention. Another moment is when Romeo confronts Tybalt after he kills Mercutio. \\"Either you, or I, or both of us!\\" is repeated, and shows this great moment of acting where he changes from distraught to furious. The last is the flashback scene when the commit suicide. In a moment that I usually don't find touching, the flashback to the moment they met, and another couple of cute scenes. It was really cute and sad.     Kay Bye.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I recently shot vow renewal ceremony with this flash and the Nikon D40.  I am not a professional...more of a prosumer.<br /><br />I took several test shots using this flash with and without a Stofen diffuser.  I found that bouncing the flash off of the low, white ceiling without the diffuser created the best shots for the ceremony.  The camera and flash was more than adequate and took some great photos.
031606792X|5.0|Although an avid reader throuhout most of my life, the last several years have been filled with the needs of family and work. I had tried many books only to put them down, just not able to muster the emotion to finish them.  BUT, I read the entire Twilight Series in a couple of weeks renewing my love and joy of reading : )  I am 53 years old and thouroughly enjoyed Stephenie Meyer's writing.  I wouldn't want you to change a thing Stephenie;the characters are perfect as is the writing. Unselfish Love can conquer ALL!!!  I loved the complex family / pack relationships and the intertwining of such deep unselfish acts of love and suspense.  I must tell you though that after finishing all four books as well as reading the Midnight Sun partial draft I truly MISS Edward and Bella and the wonderful extended FAMILIES.
0736063684|5.0|If you workout at all, or even have a passing interest in working out and anatomy, this book is a must read.    It very clearly explains, in both words and images, what muscles \\"do what\\" during exercises and helps you focus a bit more on your workouts.    We have all said \\"I want stronger arms or legs\\" or more toned areas and seeing the muscles and anatomy from the perspective in the book brings a whole new insight to what you are doing and why.    Gives a deeper meaning to exercise.
B001PJ7TUE|5.0|This album is great, it starts with a lot energy and gradually becomes more calm, but it has it burst of energy in between. Great album for those who like to hear some music while driving.
0316044695|5.0|Update December 2013... I am so excited to see that they made a movie and I can't wait to see it.  God bless our brave men and women who serve so fearlessly.<br /><br />5-26-09  I recommend this book to every American.  I believe too many of us take for granted what our FREEDOM COST!!!!  Marcus Lutrell's incredibly courageous account of his experience will give you a clear understanding of what we face in the brutal wars that we are currently in, as well as the intense training that they endure to become SEAL's.  I truly could not put this book down.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|It says a lot about a genre when one of the best movies of its kind doesn't feel at all like its predecessors in the field.  Let The Right One In is a superbly-crafted vampire/romance movie. It is both emotionally stirring and hauntingly beautiful in ways that few directors in any genre can emulate or even reach. In addition to those accolades, it is also genuinely terrifying at key points in the film.  The story centers around the outsider life of a young boy named Oskar. The audience watches him eke out a tough existence through the typical ordeals of a \\"weird\\" kid in school (bullies beating him up, girls laughing at him, etc.) in the white, barren wasteland that is apparently Sweden.  Oskar's life changes dramatically, though, when a young girl named Eli drifts into his backyard. She, too, has an \\"outsider\\" point of view in life that meshes well with Oskar's, for namely more significant reasons that just being different (probably her razor-sharp fangs and love for human blood, ho-hum).  All said, the two strike a relation, and the movie portrays a romance that is heart-breakingly earnest in its execution and epic in scope. As mentioned, it is a fantastic piece of cinematic work. Will it disturb a casual viewer in regards to violence, kids, or implied sexual innuendo? Undoubtedly, but many good movies always push the envelope of what is socially accepted or comfortably watched.  My advice? See it for what it is - a good movie. A darn good movie.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|This music not only brings together the world through the power of music, but it's actually GOOD! There's such variety, talent, and cultural style within each song, and it fits together neatly. Very inspiring.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I really like the series. The actors are great, and the episodes are very well written and directed. I especially like the little moments of parody, where the show seems to make fun of itself, or at least makes fun of the many other vampire movies of the past, and even modern television itself, as depicted with the endless sex cutscenes. Good Stuff.
0143113100|5.0|This book is fascinating and incredibly valuable for anyone with any number of neurological disorders. I have MS, a condition which the conventional medical wisdom says is incurable and degenerative, with little or no hope of improvement if you have the progressive variety, or once you reach the progressive stage. For several years, I was progressing down this road, when through a series of happy chance events, I started regularly engaging in activities which challenged the limits of my impinged abilities. These activities included long walks, physical therapy, Pilates, crossword puzzles, sudoku, etc. Much to my delight, my condition has been slowly improving over the 5 years since I started this routine. The cumulative improvement over 5 years has been dramatic.    When I read this book and learned about neuroplasticity, I think I found the reason behind my recovery. As the author of this book would put it, I have been rewiring my brain. By repeatedly forcing the brain to attempt to send messages down damaged axons, I forced it to find other paths through which the messages could travel. This offers a far more optimistic prognosis for many neurological disorders, than the conventional medical wisdom.
B001V7YWTQ|4.0|... in msg a year or so back.    my first impression even while watching the show was that clapton could not jam with winwood/traffic numbers. he is more a blues guitarist and at some level he is not able to tune into winwood's jazz rock. so i am not surprised by the not so great reviews for the show here.    but he shines on the blind faith and blues stuff - especially a rousing version of the great otis rush's double trouble.    winwood is still in fine vocal form and also shows a fine feel for guitar soloing.    blind faith was a great band but produced only one album. so if you are looking for more clapton/winwood together you should take a look.
006441034X|5.0|I absolutely love this book. I've read it 4 times already. The characters are so human, rather than unbelievably perfect. It's easy to cheer for them, be exasperated with them and love them all at the same time. The world in which the book is set is fantastic and charming, the kind of place I would wish was real. Diana Wynne Jones' books are engrossing and completely unique. I recommend them to anyone with a taste for comedy and fantasy.
B001TOD92C|4.0|Outstanding movie starring Mickey Rourke as \\"The Ram\\"  A beat-up, has-been wrestler, that all he knows is wrestling.  Mickey Rourke was so good in this movie that I forgot that this was actually a comeback movie for him.  Wrestling still for the paychecks, he soon faces trouble when a heart attack forces him to retire.  He tries to live a life outside of wrestling by trying to romance a stripper (a very good Marissa Tomei) and trying to revive a relationship with his daughter (Evan Rachel Wood).  The Ram soon realizes the only thing that ever felt normal and gives him happiness in life is wrestling.  I'm not going to give this movie away, but this is a must-see first class movie.

0307408833|5.0|Erin's cookbook with recipes from her Bakery, \\"Babycakes\\" is absolutely fantastic!  I understand many reviews state that she is misleading with the cover that says gluten free.  I am a vegan who enjoys eating gluten free whenever possible and has cut out refined sugar... The sugar she uses is natural, just like fruit, honey etc.  I don't believe there is a recipe to bake with that could be sugar free without using some sort of sweetener. Erin states again and again that she never uses refined or granulated sugar that has been processed and bleached.      Also many reviews have said that the title is misleading.  She states in the section spelt vs. gluten free that she includes spelt for those who can digest spelt easier than wheat flour like she is able to you have these recipes to choose from.  If you cannot you may be able to substitute the flour so you too may enjoy her recipe.  It states to read carefully before beginning any recipe.  Not all are gluten free, and sure she may have been able to state this in the title.. but I think that anyone that would have a difficult time digesting wheat or has a wheat sensitivity would read the entire thing before considering purchasing the cookbook.  Baking is difficult the way it is, baking with alternative ingredients seems to be even more of a science.     All in all she does a fantastic job of creating recipes and treats for those of us who would like to indulge in a healthier manner.  You just have to be careful if you do have these sensitivities and be sure to substitute where necessary.  I am glad she added everything she did, there is that much more to enjoy for those who can digest wheat or do not have any kind of sensitivities.      Cannot wait to visit the REAL \\"Babycakes\\" Bakery sometime in the near future.

0143038419|4.0|The trip which Elizabeth Gilbert takes us on is informed everywhere by her great writing skill and intelligence. But her search for herself throughout the world, however charming at first, became for me a bit too extended. She sees the places she visits with the eyes of the upscale tourist and in relation to her own spiritual quest. Their real realities do not seem to be that much for her. However in her writing about her close relations, description of her family members, and of her own feelings towards them she is superb. She demands a lot of herself, and is clearly a consciencous and caring person. What I think has attracted many about the book is the questing and adventurous spirit which is at the heart of it.
0307408833|2.0|I understand there are people who may be attracted to this book because of their food allergies or their vegan beliefs and that is great for them (except for the poor folks with gluten allergies who are disappointed at the number of recipes with gluten products!)<br />But I bought this book because of the substitutions for sugar and the hope that in using less white flour and sugar and butter, that I would be able to create tasty treats that are more healthy than what you find at the store.<br />I was very disappointed.  I baked the blueberry muffins, the red velvet cupcakes and the pumpkin muffins, and only the pumpkin muffins were edible (in my opinion).  I swaped out the bob's all purpose for the spelt flour in the blueberry muffins and they were better right from the oven, but the next day they LOOKED moist (probably because of all the oil in them because the book does not include the all-too-necessary fact of MELTING the coconut oil before measuring!!) but they tasted SO dry I could barely choke down two bites.<br />And the vanilla frosting was a disaster!!  I didn't understand how 6 hours in the fridge could turn \\"vanilla sauce\\" into \\"vanilla frosting\\" and I was right.  2 days later...it's still sauce.  And it doesn't taste anywhere near as good as they describe on the website.  I certainly wouldn't be eating this stuff straight.  It's okay, but not great.  Now I'm trying to figure out what to do with this big bowl of expensive vanilla sauce!<br />If you need to try these recipes, buy the book used and read ALL the FAQs on the website before starting.  It might save you a little money.<br />Tip on the pumpkin muffins....bake them in a \\"muffin tops\\" pan so they spread out a bit....in the regular cups, they never cook all the way through.  Tasty, but mushy.
B000683VI4|5.0|Well..I was first advised by my little sister,Rachael, to watch this amazing film. She's 16 and she saw the movie with her friends. Well, I found out that the movie was going to play one night on ABC Family and I planned to watch it then. I watched it and I must say I was shocked! The story was so heartfelt and Allie and Noah seemed to be meant for each other. You can see the chemistry and the oneness of their relationship! The Bible says that a man and woman were meant to be one and well Allie and Noah truly displayed that oneness!<br /><br />The movie made me wonder if I'll have an everlasting love relationship like them. I'm dating someone now and our relationship has lasted for a year and two months so far. It's going on three!Anyway, my mother was with me and she said that Rachel Mcadams and Ryan Gosling were good actors and I agreed! This film is truly for any romantic, one that desires true,everlasting love or one that hopes that their own relationship progresses into that.I'm just now reading the book to this film because if the movie was that good and it was done in two hours then the book is wonderful as well. I know that the book and the movie is something I'll be reading and watching over and over again to remind myself of the pleasures of true love that I want so much for myself.<br /><br />I watched this film again with my grandmother and she believed that the movie displayed what true love is and it means staying with someone for the rest of your life. That's what Noah showed in his relationship with Allie. She was the only girl he ever loved and that's basically what love supposed to be for men and women, not going from one lover to the next.Even when Noah was with another woman, Martha, in the film when he couldn't be with Allie, he didn't feel the same love for Martha as he did for Allie.For me, I hope I'll have someone that will stay forever with me. Now,I don't have a copy of this film yet but I plan on buying it soon and as for the the book, I'm going out to Barnes and Noble to buy it! Right now, I just borrowed it in the meantime from the library. So..buy this film! You won't regret it!Barnes and Noble to buy it! Right now, I just borrowed it in the meantime from the library.

0316017922|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much that I bought five additional copies to share with my friends/family.  Very interesting info.  Very well written and it makes you think!  I told my boys to give their copy to their employers when they finished, to show that they are thinking men.
B000002OX5|5.0|First time I've heard this album. LOVED it. I have just come back from seeing the Who in concert. Have always loved 'Who's Next and Tommy etc. Did not know much about their earlier stuff. This album to me shows Townshends love of the 'concept album'. Great songs and great sense of humour. This album also has a touch of early Pink Floyd about it circa Syd Barrett(which I also love). Must have been a great era.
B001MS7IBS|5.0|Although I have not yet had the opportunity to see the actual Blu-Ray release of this title, I have seen every episode of the show and will definitely be purchasing this release.  This show has captured my interest in a year of mediocre and downright ridiculous television.  Although there are parts that are somewhat graphic, and I am not a fan of that, the twists and turns have kept me on the edge of my seat throughout every episode.  Anna Torv and Joshua Jackson lead a group of wonderful actors who seemed to only get better as the show progressed.  Many of the scientific experiments and diabolical plots seem almost frighteningly possible and cause the viewer to wonder what may be happening in our own world, away from the prying eyes of the general public.  This show gets five stars from me because it kept my interest all season and has me eagerly awaiting the next one, no small feat for any television show in our house.

B0024FAR5M|5.0|Biker Gang.......nothing could be further than the truth. As it appears that nobody knows what a club is. These outlaw clubs are not (gangs) likened to street gangs or others. They are democratic in nature and very much akin to clubs like the ELKS, Masonic order, Shriners,Moms Quilting Club.....Etc,Etc.  Its the complete stupidity of the law givers and keepers that have givin this name GANG. They are not gangs they are patriots and Americans thet enjoy freedoms won by the sacrifices of brothers and sisters who gave all for FREEDOM. If there is lawless ones they will pay a price,if there is good done they will reap a harvest. There is good and bad in ALL CLUBS. You just have to chose who you are!
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|Having heard a lot of negative comments about this film I was amazed at how excellent it was. It was totally absorbing and swept me away for a journey into a strange complex and damaging relationship that ultimately led to a disturbing resolution. It delved into some extremely important dilemas which often emerge during life. Many of us are confronted with conflicting situations that call for us to choose between the expedient and the difficult. The war in Vietnam comes to mind. People had to choose to serve or not in the face of extreme moral ambiguity and all the arrayed forces of government and society. In this film Hana and her lover made choices that haunted and injured themselves and others! Kate Winslet certainly deserved the Oscar for her performance. Ralph Fiennes chose another difficult role and he delivered a deep, subtle characterization. The young German actor, David Kross, gave a bravura performance. The rest of the cast was superb! This is a serious drama with some light moments and some really dark ones as well. Overall, this is potentially a great film if you like exploring the troubled human soul that seeks resolution and restitution of its humanity.
B00160ZF5I|5.0|The first seven tracks from the \\"Real to Reel\\" LP (yes, it was an LP, clocking in at over 50 minutes) is a fine example of why Marillion was so popular (at least in Europe) in the early 80's.  Often compared to Peter Gabriel era Genesis (Fish even donned Gabrielesque makeup in their earliest shows), they were at the forefront of the neo-prog movement.  Fine musicianship, complex songs, and the energy of their early concerts all on display here.  Standout tracks are \\"Cinderella Search\\" and \\"Forgotten Sons\\".    The addition of the \\"Brief Encounter\\" EP adds little to this CD, though.  Released to promote the band's \\"Misplaced Childhood\\" tour, it contains two B-sides (\\"Lady Nina\\" and \\"Freaks\\") plus three live cuts that sound almost exactly like their studio counterparts.  Where the cuts on \\"Real to Reel\\" capture the energy of early Marillion live shows, the three live cuts from \\"Brief Encounter\\" that close this CD seem almost by-the-numbers.  The B-sides are interesting, but certainly not representative of the rest of the band's early works.    Even with the addition of the \\"Brief Encounter\\" EP, this is still a 5-star CD and is a must have for any fan of early Marillion or Fish.
B001UREJWM|5.0|I immediately liked this album a lot from beginning to end and continue to enjoy it enormously after at least 10 hearings.  I love its dark and gloomy atmosphere.  The guys have really done some great metal tune-smithing here, giving us 10 great melodies with plenty of backing riffs and percussion.  While it's true that a lot of the lyrics are obscure or even nonsensical, Dio's charisma lets him rise above the lyrics and make them sound significant even if they're not.  He sounds as good as he did 35 years ago in Rainbow.  Iommi, Butler, and Appice are in fine form and are well-captured by the recording.  Iommi gives us plenty of riffs, both electric and acoustic.  Butler's opening bass line in Double the Pain is awesome.  The guys sound like they had a blast recording this album.    One of the ironic things about this album is that the group sounds more like the Ozzy incarnation of Black Sabbath than they did on any of their albums recorded under the \\"Black Sabbath\\" name.  This is especially true in the instrumental interludes when Dio is not singing.  While they have decided to avoid using the Sabbath moniker to avoid friction with Ozzy and confusion amongst fans, I think those fans who prefer Ozzy to Dio might like this release more than previous Black Sabbath albums with Dio.
B0000636UN|3.0|C'Mon C'mon  has three of my favorite Sheryl Crow songs - Steve McQueen, Soak Up The Sun, and the title track. However, as a whole album it's not her best. I recommend Tuesday Night Music Club, her self-titled, Wildflower, and Detours before this CD. But if you are a big fan, those three tracks plus the rocker You're An Original make this one you need in your collection eventually.
B000K4X5XA|5.0|The movie:<br /><br />\\"You'll believe a man can fly.\\" That was the advertising tagline. Well, I can't think of many instances of it, but this was one time when a movie delivered on its hype. \\"Superman\\" fires on many cylinders, but the main one, the integral one, was believability. This film is an absolute achievement in terms of tone, style, and effects. For 1978, the effects are terrific, but also the performances and the writing really gel and sell the concept to the audience.<br /><br />We haven't seen yet the actor who can top Christopher Reeve's Superman. The solidness, the goodness radiating from his presence in costume, combined with the vulnerability and sheer hilarity of his Clark Kent are (perhaps) impossible to top. Margot Kidder turns in a feisty Lois Lane, and their chemistry is great. Gene Hackman is a credible Lex Luthor, both funny and menacing at the same time. Supporting players fill out a cast that just really inhabits the world and never feels less than real.<br /><br />The run time of the movie is perhaps a bit flabby, and this edition adds about 3 minute of new material. But I for one am quick to forgive it - it just so captures a feeling of innocence, wonder, Americana, that I'm willing to just bask in it, even when the action slows down.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray:<br /><br />Well, this is not one of the discs you'll pop in to show off \\"how great HD looks.\\" The film was shot almost throughout with soft focus filters which bump up the haze of lighting and obscure detail.<br /><br />BUT: It looks as good as it probably ever can and ever will. In A-B comparisons with the previous DVD (which was great for its day) the upgrade is subtle but evident. Some shots show very strong detail, when it's in focus. Check out the foliage in Lois' rooftop apartment. Some facial shots show exceptional detail in fine lines. Whenever the soft filter is absent, you can really tell you're watching an HD presentation. The colors are the main upgrade in the Blu-Ray - reds and blues really pop, and black levels are rock solid in most shots not involving visual effects. Film grain is present and generally not too obtrusive, except during some effects shots. But I prefer its presence to excessive digital noise reduction. In the end, how you feel about this Blu-Ray will depend on your emotions for the film itself (mine are very strongly positive), and how you feel about a home video accurately replicating the look and feel of the original presentation's film stock (something I'm also strongly in favor of).<br /><br />Audio is presented in a strong Dolby Digital 5.1 channel mix. There isn't much of a workout for the surrounds, but John Williams' iconic score really sings, nonetheless.<br /><br />Extras include an hour's worth of documentaries, reprises from the DVD edition. Casting tests, trailers, a commentary by Richard Donner and Tom Mankiewicz, and a wonderful score only track highlighting the music, round out the disc. Overall, at least average and probably slightly above average.<br /><br />**********<br /><br />I grew up with this film. I'm predisposed to enjoying it. As a Blu-Ray, it is hampered by the stylistic choices of the filmmakers, but still gives us a very good presentation of the film.<br /><br />It's a five star film in my book. It's certainly in the top 5 comic book movies ever made (and was the true pioneer in terms of big budget successes from comic book material.) I considered downgrading this disc by one star simply because it can't overcome the flaws inherent to the source material. For the paltry sum Amazon is asking for it, you really can't go wrong, though. Kids of all ages (ages 3 to 83?) who just want to feel good about the world will be transported to a better, simpler, more beautiful place. Fans of 1970's cinema will find a lot to love, as well. There are many shots which really shine in detail, and almost all of the shots benefit from zippier colors. If you don't own this film otherwise, or are just a fanof the action/comic book genre, this is a must-buy. It's a classic.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|I had no problems with this disc in ps3 whatsoever. i bought and watched it the day it came out. the day i had purchased it, i didnt have internet connected to my ps3. it did the sknyet loading thing, and found no connection and then played the film right away. it was awesome! i have since hooked up my internet connection to my ps3 and the blu ray live features are pretty cool too! except, anyone know where the 3rd version is? am i missing it? is it on the reg menu or is it something you find on bd live? i was excited when i saw this version was coming out before the new movie, i had a terminator movie marathon before i went to the midnight salvation showing. i wish they'd stop reissuing this movie though cos i'm sick of buying it! but i will fall victim to repurchasing, as this is my favorite movie of all time!

1603090002|4.0|I have a theory about The League of Extraordinary Gentleman: The Black Dossier.  My understanding is that it was the last Alan Moore book published by DC Comics (under its subsidiary Wildstorm) and my suspicion is that this was Mr. Moore's revenge on a publisher to which he held no great love. Looking at the reviews on Amazon `The Black Dossier' is either a literary masterpiece or an unreadable mess. I side with the later crowd. 1910 on the other hand is published by Top Shelf Comics which is completely independent of any major publisher so I was hoping the volume III might return the League to its roots.<br /><br />1910 is far better than the Black Dossier but still comes up short. Somehow I think that Alan Moore is missing what made the original League so popular. For me it was fascinating to see popular literary characters brought together to form a super group and in many cases the characters contained exceptional abilities that today would be termed super powers. In the end the group fought each other even more than they fought external foes. In particular Hawley Griffin (The Invisible Man) and Mr. Hyde prove to be completely uncontrollable. The new team includes Carnacki the Ghost Hunter and A.J. Raffles the Gentleman Thief. What? You've never heard of Carnacki and Raffles? Join 99% of the public. Not only are the new members FAR more obscure they are also dull as dishwater. The interleague squabbling consists mainly of the semi-immortal, gender shifting Orlando from The Black Dossier being so annoying that the other members want to slap him.<br /><br />If nothing else The League of Extraordinary Gentleman may inspire readers to learn more about the literary references in the stories. I ended up hitting Wikipedia for Carnacki and A.J. Raffles but I have to confess found them kind of boring and didn't investigate deeply. There certainly is no lack of characters from the early 1900's that Moore could have used so I'd be curious as to how he made these choices.<br /><br />When Alan Moore is at the top of his game he is the best comic writer ever and when he's off he's still really good (Black Dossier being the one exception). This is a really good book but it's not a great book and it pales in comparison to volumes one and two. I'll definitely get the next volume when it comes out but I won't be on pins and needles waiting.r /><br />When Alan Moore is at the top of his game he is the best comic writer ever and when he's off he's still really good (Black Dossier being the one exception).

B001PPLJIQ|2.0|I have not read the book, and I waited until the DVD to see the film. After all the Oscar nominations and rave reviews by friends, I suppose I expected something more. Instead, this movie is really about something less. A young man has an affair with his first lover, a damaged woman, whom he remembers for the rest of his life. That's it. The characters are one-dimensional, we never really see what drives Ralph Fiennes' character, and there isn't even much of a story line. If it weren't for the Holocaust factor, this movie may not have gotten a second look. Even that factor plays a supremely small, albeit admittedly powerful, role in the film. In the end we have a lifetime of lost love and unexplored secrets played quietly by two great actors. Great acting, directing, and cinematography seems to have puffed up an otherwise simple story. One kept hoping for a remarkable twist at the end that never comes. I really don't see what all the excitement is about.

I have lost 16 pounds since I started doing this video, along with eating much better and some other exercises. The video is short but a wonderful workout. I LOVE that there are really three different workouts and that each workout is divided into circuits. When I did this for the first time, I could barely get through it but I have stuck with it and I'm glad I did. I just ordered another of Jillian's videos and hope it is as good as this one.

1400063515|5.0|Do not let some of the negative reviews deter you from reading Nassim Taleb's book.  I found the book to not be overwhelmingly long--barely over 300 pages--nor was I terribly put off by his writing style.  It is true that he is not the most perfectly elegant of writers, but I read his two books primarily because I was interested in the content of his ideas--not his style.    It is also true that NNT is not overwhelmed with a sense of his own humility.  Even, apparently, his mother is aware that fact as he points out in this book.  He is what he is and you need bear with that fact if you want to read the book.  I might add, though, that if you stick with the book to the end, he rather humbly thanks the good reader for completing the book.  If you think about it, all of us have moments of arrogance mixed in with moments of humility.  Nassim simply has a bit more arrogance than the \\"norm\\"--not that he would necessarily admit to a \\"normalized\\" distribution of arrogance in the human population.  I might be mistaken, though, perhaps he would....    Humility is a funny commodity.  Years ago I heard of what I thought was a wonderful anecdote about the former Israeli prime minister, Golda Meir.  Mrs. Meir was presiding over the cabinet meeting and was listening to an excessively long declaration of modesty by one of her ministers.  She admonished him something in the following fashion:  \\"Why don't you shut up?  You are not great enough to be humble.\\"      NNT directly attacks the mathematical and statistical methods utilized by the economics and finance communities for analyzing risk.  He makes the case that the methods used are highly inappropriate for developing reasonably accurate models of risk.  He is far from being totally against the use of mathematical methods for the assessment of risk, only that they be intellectually honest mathematical models that own up to the high degree of uncertainty inherent in economic and financial data.  The black swans are always with usand no amount of computer generated Gaussian statistical models can eliminate those basic unpredictable events.  He takes the position that these communities need to \\"move on\\" and find less inaccurate and more honest predictive models using mathematical methods that abandon \\"excessive precision\\" (or rather inaccurate \\"precision\\") with their forecasts.  He suggests that Mandelbrotian fractal methods might be the most fruitful methods to pursue in the future for building investment risk assessment models.    He has a rather skeptical turn of mind on most issues.  Montaigne, Poincaire, Keynes, Hayek, Popper are all thinkers that he appears to greatly admire and to have very largely influenced his thinking as he explains in this book.    His advice to the great unwashed of us inhabiting \\"Mediocristan\\" is to invest 80% to 90% of our savings in US Treasuries, CD's, municipal bonds, etc.  Minimize your risk to negative black swans--e.g., stock market collapses, etc.  The remaining 10%-20% you can \\"gamble\\" with if you so desire.  You still maintain your security nest egg while looking for a possible big pay off.  For the high risk 10%-20% \\"investment,\\" look for black swans whose probability of occurring may be misvalued by the markets.  Then bet against the \\"conventional wisdom\\" and see if you can score the \\"big payoff.\\"  If high risks bets do not appeal to you, keep all of your savings in the relatively secure investments of US treasuries, municipal bonds, etc.     Seems like sensible advice to me.  Read the book, see what you think.
B0017JKEL8|5.0|I caught a couple episodes on cable and thought the show was exceptional, but after you take out the commercials and throw in the pristine quality of HD this series beats most of the movies I've seen on Blu-Ray. The plots, the actors, the period design - all are amazing. Not owning this would be a sin for any Blu-Ray owner. This show resembles an epic film of 60s American life rather than a TV series. The jokes about electric typewriters and carousel slide projectors when they were cutting edge technology as well as the infidelities of the chauvinistic jet set captures the time. I can't help but play an entire disc as soon as I start playing the first episode on it. I can't wait for Season Two to be released on Blu-Ray.

B00192KCQ0|4.0|Death Magnetic is far better than the St Anger and Load sessions Although Load has some good stuff, it was not Metallica metal music. With Death Magnetic there is a bit of a return to pre-Bob Rock days.  The album here is much harder and faster than we have heard from Hetfield and boys for over a decade.  I like this work, but I keep feeling like this is a forced effort and something is missing specifically the musical epics and themes are missing here.  There are a lot of solid riffs here and jam sessions with decent lyrics, but this doesnt sound like a band with creative musical abilities that gave us Creeping Death, One or even Enter Sandman. I like that they tried to go back and give us a new instrumental piece with \\"Suicide and Redemption\\", but again, there seems to be a missing element here where the music used seemed to make sense together.  We can hear recycled music efforts of Master of Puppets, Battery, One, Dyers Eve and the For Whom the Bell Tolls.
B001FB55HG|5.0|Terminator Salvation is a 2009 American science fiction post-apocalyptic war film released on May 21, 2009,Directed by McG, it is the fourth film in the Terminator series and stars Christian Bale as John Connor, before becoming leader of the Resistance, and Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright, a cyborg who believes he is human. It also introduces a young version of the first film's hero, Kyle Reese, played by Anton Yelchin, and depicts the origins of the T-800 Model 101 Terminator. Being both a sequel and a prequel to the previous films, Salvation, set in 2018, focuses on the war between humanity and Skynet. It abandons the time travel element of previous entries in the series, which centered on Terminators and other characters traveling through time to either kill or protect John Connor before the events of Judgment Day unfold. After Skynet has destroyed much of humanity in a nuclear holocaust, John struggles to become the leader, but in this future, Marcus Wright has somehow altered it, and the T-800 is coming online sooner than expected. The film also centers on Kyle Reese and how he became who he was in the first film.maintained are two elements of the previous films; that John is an outsider to the authorities, and someone of future importance is being protected, and in this film it is Kyle Reese.The film's theme is \\"where you draw the line between machines and humans\\".The friendship between Marcus -- who was executed (for murder) when humanity still ruled the world -- and Kyle Reese illustrates how war and suffering can bring out the best in people.<br />The title was derived from this second chance given to humanity and to Marcus, in addition to John's efforts to save humanity from the machines.<br />The machines are, Aerostats, which are smaller versions of the Aerial Hunter Killers from the previous films. The Aerostats send a signal to the 60-foot-tall humanoid Harvesters. They are very big and slow, so they utilize Mototerminators to capture humans, and the Harvesters place them in Transporters.The T-1,which makes a brief return in the film as one of the machines guarding prisoners as they head into their holding cells.The film features the rubber-skinned T-600s and T-700s as interpreted by Kyle Reese's description in the original film.Completing Skynet's domination of air, land and sea is the Hydrobot.The Film is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and language, unlike the previous R-rated films.Running time 115 min.rs place them in Transporters.The T-1,which makes a brief return in the film as one of the machines guarding prisoners as they head into their holding cells.The film features the rubber-skinned T-600s and T-700s as interpreted by Kyle Reese's description in the original film.Completing Skynet's domination of air, land and sea is the Hydrobot.The Film is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and language, unlike the previous R-rated films.Running time 115 min.

B001GCUO1Q|3.0|In Canada, in 1845, two half-brothers named Logan and Victor, go on the run after Logan kills his father.  They go on to fight in all the major wars, both being able to heal quickly and being just about indestructible.  In the 1970's, they are recruited by William Stryker (Huston) who is putting together a mysterious team.  While Victor (Schreiber) is comfortable doing the team's dirty deeds, Logan (Jackman) isn't, and breaks from the team to lead a normal life.  Eventually, Victor and Stryker come looking for Logan, so they can return him to his place in that team, but Logan won't go easily, and soon pays the price.<br /><br />With the success of the \\"X-Men\\" movies, it was only a matter of time before Wolverine got a solo movie, this time in the form of a prequel.  In \\"Wolverine\\", we get his origins, as well as a look at a number of other new mutants.  We see the bond that Wolverine and Sabertooth have, and we see a glimpse of further X-Men movies to come.  Jackman is clearly comfortable in the role he has played three times before.  He does nothing special here, but he doesn't disappoint either.  Schreiber gives depth to Victor/Sabertooth that wasn't there in the first X-Men movie.  That being said, \\"Wolverine\\" falters due to an enormous amount of other mutants and a story where the ending is pretty much a given.  It has to get to \\"point B\\" to stay in continuity with the first X-Men movie, and so there is never any real doubt as to who will live between the characters we have seen before.  X-Men fans will be pretty happy though regardless.
B001U7FWM8|5.0|Since the previous reviewers have so elegantly praised this seminal work by Grizzly Bear, I shall not repeat but echo their sentiments. I know no other band so transportive in their music- they do so well in creating music that supports the complexities of feeling & being. I detect some (perhaps subconscious?) influence of the obscure-yet-amazing Fleetwood Mac guitarist Danny Kirwin as well as the sweeping spiritual wailing of a channeled Jeff Buckley....However....Grizzly Bear have made a stunning record of their own, and, like Roxy Music decades before them, made a world for us to inhabit.
B001UREJWM|2.0|Before writing this, i read the 80 or so reviews of this cd first. Before that, i listened to this cd mutiple times after buying it on vinyl and the Walmart version with the different cover as well as the regular BB edition with the extra dvd and my overall question to the other reviewers is  -  What are you people listening to?????? Sure it's better than current Metallica or 95 % of anything else out now that's heavy. So What!  It isn't any good. The best song, Bible Black, wouldn't make any Sabbath lp thru Born Again with Ian Gillan and would be a minor cut on the Tony Martin albums! Look, I love Iommi; as a current live rock guitarist right now, he is still the best out there. I've seen him live 25 times. For writing new material, it's over and has been for a while. I don't know if having Geezer write the lyrics would have helped this effort, probably not, but this sounds like another Dio record. And i don't think an innovative producer would have made any difference either. You only have so many good riffs in you and Iommi has had more than anyone ever. Did you ever wonder why the classic rockers cannot do anything NEW that rocks when they get past a certain age? Iommi, Townshend, Clapton, Blackmore, Beck, Richards to name a few. And yet live, they play the old stuff the best they ever did. It's because they're 2 entirely different aptitudes. Still, i give Iommi credit for trying to continue compared to someone like Jimmy Page who's had nothing to offer for almost 30 years after plagiarizing old black blues artists the previous ten years. The biggest hoax ever put over the rock world was Led Zeppelins \\"supposed\\" superiority over Black Sabbath. Well, right now compare the Iommi/Ozzy canon of work over the last 40 years with Page /Plant and tell me which is more influential, which is superior?     One final test. Listen to TDYK and then listen Sabbath's 1978 lp, \\"Never Say Die\\" probably their least acclaimed work ever. It absolutely kills this new effort. When i wanna rock, I'll listen to NSD, you can waste your time with this drivel.

B001GCUNYO|4.0|\\"I Will Look for You. I WILL Find You. And I'll Kill You.\\" You do NOT want to be the guy that Liam Neeson says that to in Taken.<br /><br />If you thought that Liam was bad (and by bad I mean gooood) as Ra's al Ghul in [[ASIN:B000PC6A3E Batman Begins]], wait 'til you see him as an ex-spy whose daughter is abducted while visiting Paris. Unfortunately for the abductors, Neeson was trained to \\"prevent bad things from happening.\\" So when you combine a loving, overprotective father whose daughter has been abducted with a ruthless cold-blooded \\"preventer of bad things from happening,\\" you'd better not be in his way.<br /><br />While some of the scenarios in Taken go a little over the top, the action is thrilling to watch, and Neeson is flawless in his role. I don't mean this to be a Neeson love-fest, but the fact is that the movie is 90% Neeson; he's on-screen in at least 90% of the scenes. It is indeed Neeson that takes Taken from being an average movie to being a really good movie.<br /><br />You won't fall asleep watching Taken. Surprisingly the movie is PG-13; even the Unrated Extended Cut doesn't cross the PG-13 line (as far as I remember anyway). There's lots of action. Good acting. A simple plot. Taken worked for me...I'd highly recommend it for you.

031606792X|3.0|In short (minor spoiler alert): 1) Too sugary sweet an ending.  I like a \\"happily ever after\\" ending sometimes too, but not that happily!  There was no sacrifice, no negative.  The consequences that were actually built up over the previous books were just magically ignored.  Meyer even had one of the characters become upset over this!  2) The characters didn't stay true to themselves.  Jake was the only slightly true one, otherwise Edward and Bella did 180's.  3) Anticlimactic ending.  With all the build up, hopeless lost cause setup, etc... all we got was a little talking and an apology from the big bad \\"villains\\"...oh OK, one character we'd never seen before died, but that doesn't count.  I don't mean someone had to die, but the third book had 100 times the climax this one did.<br /><br />It was just a little disappointing.

I was interested in the book because I love his show and it kind of kills to birds with one stone. Gardening Tips and recipes for the stuff you grow in one book! It's also a great read. Jamie wrote it as more of a stream of consciousness than your typical cookbook so it's actually fun to read while your not cooking too. There are 2 things I love about Jamie. 1- His love for the ingredients. If you've seen his show you know what I mean. He really respects the food and where it comes from. He makes you think about that here. 2- He keeps it simple. He is not a fussy cook and these recipes are ones you can pull off easily. He doesn't show off like some chefs, he wants you to be able to make this stuff! Even if you don't have your own garden this is still a great cookbook. If you want to make simple, fresh, rustic dishes give this book a go!

B000U0F7RG|5.0|I've never been a frequent viewer of WB or CW (whichever it is now) so I had never heard of the Gilmore Girls until about a month ago when I was flipping through the channels and happened upon the SOAP network were they played two shows back to back one weekend. And that's how I met Lorelai and Rory. Immediately, I began search for the show times and channels, but to my dismay I found out it was canceled. So I just hopped on Amazon and searched for the seasons, and lo and behold I found the complete set (which really wasn't all the hard). As soon as it arrived I began my \\"Gilmore Girls marathon\\" all 153 episodes, which took about two week of non-stop continuous watching. Every day after work until bedtime, all weekend long from dawn to dusk, I couldn't get enough of it. And then when it was over I couldn't believe it. Like that was it. Over. I was sad because I felt like there was so much more there. But oh so glad that I got to experience it. I felt like an honorary member of Stars Hollow (only to find out it's not a real town, boo) I so badly wanted to attend a town meeting or a dance-off. It made me feel like times were good and there are actually good-hearted people out there. I loved the fast-paced chatting, the back-and-forth mother/daughter banter, Richard and Emily, the towns people, Luke, Lane, Sookie, Jackson, Paul Anka, everything and everyone about Stars Hollow.     It was a nice escape and an excellent show!
B000MLNUBI|3.0|Nice watch. I've owned it for years. After wearing it for such a long time I sent it to Swatch for repair. ( Band replacement, Lost a few minutes a day) They wouldn't repair it. I did not expect for Swatch to perform the work for free but they didn't even attempt to help me. Just sent the watch back. If I pay $160.00 for a timepiece I would expect the company that sells it to at least perform minor repairs. Or am I expecting too much???????? I'll never buy another Swatch again.

B001FB55HG|1.0|Not only did I realize the movie was bad, about 10 minutes into the film.. but it never got any better after watching for an hour. It came across as a badly executed commercial that was waaay too long. I have actually seen commercials that were more interesting. I just do not think there is any reason this movie should have been allowed to be as bad as it was. The CG Graphics were sub-par, the acting was.. eh.. and the direction seemed to be so random, that I couldn't even focus on what was good.. which was.. I dunno, maybe NOTHING?!<br /><br />I have NEVER walked out of a movie, and about an hour and a half after it started, myself and a buddy just looked at each other and decided to leave the theater.It was such a let-down that and I really cannot understand how a movie that was basically designed to re-awaken a very popular franchise, was so badly put together. I hope for the best, as I have heard they signed a 3 picture deal. Please, if you have a choice, and why wouldn't you, see something else.
B000NIVJHM|5.0|Great blooper in the movie.  The scene where Cynthia Rhodes, is training Baby with Patrick Swayze in his room.  Cynthia picks up the tone arm, and places it on the record, immediately puts the tone arm back onto its holder, and the song Hungry Eyes starts.  The needle never touched the record!
B00194W6V2|3.0|Cecelia Ahern's debut novel, which became a best-selling book far beyond Ireland, the novel's setting, can be described as a perfect representative of the fiction subgenre often (slightly derisively) referred to as ChickLit. Turned into an equally successful movie, whose screenplay moves away from the book in that its protagonist is not a heartbroken Irish widow but an American lady (played by Hillary Swank) mourning her recently deceased Irish husband, PS, I LOVE YOU is clearly targeted at female readers - a ladies' book, easily accessible ChickLit from Ireland.<br />To be honest, I, a dumb and insensitive male, did not find the novel to be half as heartwrenching as the vast majority of its female readers. Still, by and large, it is fairly entertaining if somewhat clich&eacute;-ridden and about 100 pages too long.<br />Not to be recommended for young turks or any other male readers whose romantic strain is still safely locked away in hibernation.
B0019X3ZZY|5.0|I saw this motion picture when it first came out in San Francisco.  The ad in the paper for it called it \\"the most horrifying movie ever made\\".  Thinking it was a horror film, I went.  It was playing at the Cento Cedar Theater in San Francisco, a small theater located in a alley.  It was a art house with coffee, cakes, etc (really posh for 1975).  Horror film it was not, previous writers have already explained the plot.  During the scene in the dining room when the gurneys of food were brought out and served (it was feces collected) a quarter of the audience got up and left, very offended. One woman, actually puked on the floor.  Those who disobeyed the rules, were punished at the end of the movie, with graphic scenes of mutilations and other disturbing things.  I finally gave in and bought the book, it is a massive writing, and considering the author, was very well written.  Excellent translation to DVD.  I recommend this film highly
1416562605|3.0|I know this book has generated tons of controversy, and after reading it, I feel like much of the criticism (undermining literature on India Shining, lackluster prose, rude, simplistic, undeserving of the Booker) was spurred by jealousy. True it's not an uber literary book, and the narration is so irreverent, the characters so plainly drawn, that I couldn't always connect. But I loved the subject. Mr. Adiga fearlessly plows through the life of a village boy turned city entrepreneur, with nary a pitying glance. \\"The White Tiger\\" is structured and paced well, the story is engaging, but mostly it was the commitment to outlining the Indian class divide, to the struggle of the poor and the darkness against the rich and the light, that got me. Even though they're stark and caricatured at times, these themes make this an important book.
B00003CXFV|4.0|The film opens with an interview of a young woman. \\"Look.\\" She leaves disappointed, and her car is hit when someone drives through a red light. The testimony in court doesn't go well; inappropriate language for this young mother may prejudice the jury. [Unfair, but that is life.] She applies for jobs over the phone. No experience? Erin gets a job at that law firm. She meets the new neighbors. Does she have problems at work? Erin learns why there are medical records in a real estate file. The Jensen family has medical problems. Chromium is involved, it can be deadly. There is a factory a few hundred yards away. Erin searches the records at the water board and finds evidence of pollution. Was she a beauty queen? [Looks aren't everything, manners count.]    Lawyer Ed Masry drops by for information. Erin gets even more information. Did PG&E pay for that doctor? The illnesses of the Jensen family can be explained by exposure to chromium hexavalent-6. \\"Wow!\\". Former neighbors of the Jensen's visit the office for advice. Lawyer Ed explains the laws, Erin explains the costs of litigation. Erin wears sandals in a barn yard! She talks to other neighbors. There are four more families involved. Can Erin find the evidence for law suits? Will she be threatened? Will the case become too large for a small firm? The judge upholds the suits, they will go to trial. Erin's job made her respected by people. [Feared rather than loved?] Masry has a new partner with the most experience in toxic tort law.    PG&E wants the case settled by arbitration. Erin still has a problem in dealing with people. Lawyer Theresa does not have the common touch. There is a problem in their suits, all of the plaintiffs must agree. If they don't use binding arbitration the case can go on for 15 or 20 years. Erin gets the signatures of the plaintiffs. Would a chance meeting bring new evidence? \\"How did you do this?\\" The judge decides for the plaintiffs, the amount is on the high end. Erin, ever abrasive, getsa surprise from Lawyer Ed. \\"Do beauty queens know how to apologize?\\" The settlement in Hinkley vs. PG&E was the largest award in a direct-action lawsuit in US history. Other suits against PG&E were pending.    This film dramatizes the events behind the law suit. The real Erin plays the part of the waitress early in this film. Note how the story of this law suit was boosted by personal drama. Compare it to \\"A Civil Action\\".
1400082773|5.0|I loved \\"Dreams from my Father.\\"  Of course, I'm biased as I think Barack Obama is a godsend, a miracle, a man among men.  Thus his memoir was only grist for my love mill, and what grist.  He's even nobler, more insanely smart and reflective than I knew.  And his half white-ness, ie half-non-blackness, his Indonesian memories, his African heritage, his Hawaiian upbringing, all of it creates space for the rest of us hypenates, although I'm still willing to give as much of that to the American blacks as they want or need.  The book itself is beautifully written, carefully structured, well paced, deeply thought through.  A sometimes political, sometimes social, always intimate reckoning of what it might take to take ahold of your life, and thus your world.
0385340990|5.0|The novel, told in a series of letters, describes Guernsey both during and after World War II.  The hardships, problems, and triumphs of the islanders are the main focus.  The are individualists brought together by circumstance and bound together by reading.  Woven into this tapestry are two love stories (told well, not at all sappy). I read it on the Kindle and enjoyed every minute.
045122499X|5.0|\\"World Without End\\" is the first book I've read, maybe since my teens, that I stayed up all night to finish.  It took me 3 days to get through the first 500 pages and by then I was obsessed with Mr. Follett's depiction of 14th century England, his incisive characterisation, the heartbreaking twists and turns of plot, the intimate interplays of church and guild and family and love and industry.  I finished the last 500 pages in one thrilling night long rush, mostly because I had fallen in love with the people (which is perhaps the most important thing in a book).  How deeply and compassionately Mr. Follett knows the human condition.

0765350386|5.0|Wow.  That is what I said when I put this book down, finished. Just...wow.  I've never read anything by Brandon Sanderson before, but hearing that he would be finishing the Wheel of Time Series that I recently started, I figured I should get an idea of how good a writer he is and if he is capable of finishing such a complex story. Long story short, I was not disappointed.  The first thing that jumped out at me was the originality of the setting and premise. &#34;Mistborn&#34; is set in an almost post-apocalyptic world where, in the distant past, the farmboy turned demi-god failed and evil took over. The world is a wasteland ruled by an invincible mage tyrant, choked with ash and soot that falls endlessly, dominated by a brutal upper-crust of nobleman, and shrouded at night by veils of eerie mist filled with strange beasts. Few people even remember that the sun was yellow once, or that plants are supposed to be green and healthy, rather than brown and dead.  The consistency with which Sanderson fleshed out this unique world impressed me a great deal. If there was anything wrong with the worldbuilding, it was that the maps included were a little difficult to read and follow, but there wasn't much traveling done in this book anyway, so that was a minor issue.  In terms of character development, Mistborn excelled. Seriously, this is some of the best characterization I've ever seen. Vin and Kelsier are of particular note, but just about all the minor characters had their own unique charm that made them individualistic and the interaction between them that much more believable.  I get the sense that Sanderson was influenced in part by Robin Hobb, because like her, he sometimes names characters after concepts. However, this is done with a good deal more subtle technique. The pseudo-nobleman with a cane who manipulates emotions is named &#34;Breeze&#34;, the super-human soldier is named &#34;Ham&#34;, the ambitious noble family are called, &#34;The Ventures&#34; and so on.And then's there the dialogue. I won't lie to you; I'm not easily impressed when it comes to dialogue, and Mistborn blew me away. The characters actually sounded like real people, and some pretty darn funny people to boot. Every few lines there was wit or good-natured mockery, which really lent an authentic air to the conversations.  The plot starts out good and keeps getting better. The resolution and ending were excellent. The author successfully tied up a great deal of loose ends and dropped a lot of plot twists in very few pages, without even giving the feel of it being rushed. The romance sub-plot, minor as it was in this book, was great. The Magic system was extremely original and innovative, and at the same time very deep, complex, and interconnected, with a lot of potential. I have a minor issue that one of Vin's abilities--specifically, the one she used at the end--kinda came out of nowhere, but it wasn't enough to take away from my enjoyment of the story.  I could go on and on and on and on about how awesome this book is, but I'll end here with saying that you'll be hard-pressed to find a better, more intelligently-written series than Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn. I give it five glowing stars and my highest recommendation.
B00005JPCF|1.0|On the surface this movie is a lot of fun.  Music, dancing, singing, and adventure.  My daughter just loves all that and enjoys this movie a lot.  However its now at its final resting spot at the bottom of the trash heap.    As an adult I take serious issue however with this movies attempt to indoctrine our children with a far left agenda.  The movie talks endlessly about how bad humans are stealling these poor guys fish to the point they are starving.  In fact everyone is starving and just laying around waiting to die all do to us humans.    It is one thing to push for responsible practices and encourage people to be good stewards of the Earth but its another to place all blame on us.    My daughters other favorite movie is finding nemo but since the fish in this movie do not talk, we are to feel no sympathy for them, only the other animals that eat them... but not humans of course because we are bad... and they want your impressionable child to know that!    The good side to all of this is it gives us as parents the opportunity to educate our children on a number of issues from being good stewards of the earth, responsibility, biased media, and how reality is far different than this garbage.
B00005NQLP|4.0|Graham Nash has always had a nack for writing great songs. He wrote many of the C.S.N. classics such as \\"Our House\\", \\"Marakesh Express\\" and others. It is surprising that his solo career has has limited success. This recording is another example of good music that is not widely known. The songs are solid and the players are the best of the time. I feel that if you enjoy his work with David Crosby or with C.S.N. (&Y) then you will find yhis music familiar.

1439157383|2.0|I attended a fiction writing course at Duke several years back, and in one of the very first lessons, we were told never to end a book, story, etc. with a cliche or something that deprived the reader of satisfaction or resolution...and the instructor gave as specific examples endings such as \\"and then she woke up\\" or \\"and then she died.\\"  Too bad the author didn't learn this - I was most disappointed to reach the end of this book to find a total cop out on the plot - the protagonist dies, right when you might be able to get a glimpse of the emotional and psychological ramifications of the conflict that forms the basis of the book.  That, along with the let down in character development, especially towards the end, the use of highly stereotyped characters, made this book a let down in the end.  The author used a nice narrative form, and then got lazy with it.  Gripping subject matter, but in the end, a result that mooted the entire point.
B001K3JF7K|1.0|I have 6-7 of Diana Krall cd's and love them all.  However, this one does not measure up to the others.  She sleep walks through each tune with zero passion.  It doesn't even sound like her.  Strictly elevator music, not jazz, not pop, nothing new.
B001TH16DS|5.0|This is the smartest choice you can make right now. I know you're smarter than the average bear because you're interested in a blu-ray copy of one of the smartest TV shows from the early days of Science Fiction television. The film transfer is more beautiful than I expected. The sound is rich and full. The color is more real than any incarnation you've ever seen in your life. I only hope all episodes of every Trek series gets the blu-ray treatment! To pass this collection up would be illogical.
B000UR9T82|4.0|\\"Spider-Man\\" was arguably the first modern super-hero comic book. It demonstrated how a fundamentally idiotic idea (attaining super powers from the bite of a radioactive spider has been mercilessly parodied) could work, if the story resonated with the readers. Lee and Ditko had the sense to make the hero a geeky teenager who has super powers thrust on him, without the experience or wisdom to know what to do. The parallel with the transition from puberty to maturity is obvious, but it works. \\"Spider-Man\\" was probably the biggest single influence in moving comic books away from melodrama and toward drama.<br /><br />Sam Raimi, a director notorious for over-the-top silliness, would seem the least-likely choice for such material, but he handles it perfectly. The focus is firmly on Peter's relationships with his family and Mary-Jane, even in the third film (which has too many villains, and too many plot lines to tie up). It's underplayed, with Maguire's performance convincingly shy without being sappy. He might be a geek, but he's no dork. Rosemary Harris is especially fine as everyone's idea of the perfect nuturing aunt. Her performance is much better than it has to be.<br /><br />The only unbelievable character is J Jonah Jameson, but then, he was over-the-top in the comics, too; no Perry White, he. J K Simmons (perhaps best-known as the bisexual Nazi murderer-rapist in HBO's \\"Oz\\") shows he's just as good at comedy, nailing the character. (No jokes, please.)<br /><br />If the Spider-Man films have a problem, it's that there's a limited number of feats a super hero can perform, and only so many emotional conflicts a human being can experience. Not surprisingly, their situations and story arcs are uncomfortably like those in the first three Superman films: Peter swings up to catch Mary Jane as she falls (he later repeats the act with his aunt). He abandons his super-identify because it interferes with what he most wants out of life. People \\"on the street\\" aid him when he's in trouble. He even loses and regains his super powers. And in the third film, Gwen Stacy's inevitable fall from a building is so close to Lois Lane's helicopter fall (with the mic cable replaced by a telephone cord) that it verges on plagiarism. Not to mention that, as in S3, a drastic change in the hero's personality is a central plot element. Whether or not this is conscious copying, it does give an uncomfortable sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, which is why I've awarded these well-done and entertaining films only four stars.<br /><br />I can't resist pointing out that, as with most super-hero films, there is an utter disregard for the laws of physics. Worse, the animators don't understand one of the most-basic: F = ma. Objects and people move almost instantly from rest to motion (or back), which is not only unrealisitc, but impossible. (Disney had a good grasp of this 70 years ago. Digital animators don't seem to have caught it. Note, for example, how Shrek moves as if his body is massless.) S-M3 also overlooks e = mv^2/2 -- there's no way a swinging crane could crack a building's girders.<br /><br />The Blu-ray transfers are of the high quality one expects. (They /ought/ to be -- Sony owns Columbia.) The second film includes the extended \\"2.1\\" version. I don't believe there's any supplemental material that hasn't already appeared on the DVDs.loses and regains his super powers.

B001RIY4WE|5.0|I was weary about this Blu-ray after reading a review claiming the image was not clear enough.  How wrong that review was! I am a true videophile. I bought the earlier blu-ray of T2 that came out last year for $10, and it looked terrible. It was grainier than the Ultimate DVD, but this T2 version is amazing! I love to be able to see the hairs on a person's arm, and the individual pores on their face.  This Disc delivers all of it without typical over-pixelation!  What do I mean?  Certain discs (like the \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" blu-ray discs) are digitized too much, causing you to see tiny pixel-dots everywhere; in faces, in the sky, etc.  Some people think this makes the picture more vivid, but the unnatural pixels everywhere is really annoying to me (especially with a 65\\" LCD TV).  This T2 transfer is fantastic!  There is no annoying pixelation anywhere, but the picture is crisp and clear.  You will see pores on the actor's faces, every detail is rendered flawlessly.  This is as good as my other favorite Blu-Ray transfer \\"The Bucket List\\", which is also just as clear! No matter what you prefer, there has never been a better transfer of the film, ever.  The audio is also stunning, and you get all 3 versions of the film with the same clarity.  There is no need for any other transfer to ever be done.  This T2 edition is true to the original film, and it is a spectacular addition to any blu-ray collection.
0876852630|4.0|Bukowski followed the coming of age of Henry Chinaski covered in Ham On Rye with this rather sordid look at his young adulthood. Chinaski leaves home in LA and wanders across WWII era America drifting from meaningless job to meaningless job and flop house to flop house. There's a deadpan delivery as he relates his tale of drifting, drinking, whoring and losing job after job without seeming to care that gives the story an air of desperation and acceptance of a downward trajectory that seems inevitable to him.<br />Despite what sounds like a depressing story, reading factotum is like witnessing a train wreck. You can't look away even as you're shocked by what you see. Credit that to Bukowsi's sharp prose style and acerbic wit. I also enjoyed the portrayal of an already seedy downtown Los Angeles of the 40's.
0525421033|5.0|Seventeen-year-old Mia may have an almost perfect life. She's a senior in high school and recently auditioned for Julliard. She's dating Adam, the lead singer and guitarist of a band, and she has a good relationship with her parents. Quite honestly, she really doesn't have anything to complain about.    Then on a snowy February day, her life forever changes. The choice is no longer should she move to New York City and pursue her dream or stay in Oregon to be with her family or Adam. The choice she now has to make is between life and death.    If I Stay is told in the present after the car accident as Mia watches herself in a coma. Her family and friends arrive at the hospital to wait, hope and pray for her. The story also unfolds by flashbacks of Mia and her family. It's in these flashbacks where the reader comes to understand the intensity of her relationship with her parents, younger brother Teddy and Adam.    When Mia overhears an ICU nurse speaking with her grandparents, she realizes she can either choose life or death.        \\"You might think that the doctors or nurses or all this is running the show,\\" she says, gesturing to the wall of medical equipment. \\"Nuh-uh. She's running the show. Maybe she's just biding her time. So you talk to her. You tell her to take all the time she needs, but to come on back. You're waiting for her.\\" (p. 69)    It's not until Adam arrives to see her that Mia comes to understand the impact her decision will have. Not only for her, but also for Adam and her friends and family.    Although If I Stay is a young adult novel, adult readers will be moved by the story too. It's a beautifully written story that I highly recommend.
0307277453|5.0|While the arguments proving evolution and debunking the concepts of creationism and intelligent design have been brilliantly done in a number of books, there have been few books that do a better job at it than Neil Shubin's Your Inner Fish.  What makes this book so exceptional is that I don't think there's a single reference to creationism; instead, Shubin so strongly demonstrates the proof of human evolution that the alternative proposal comes off as ridiculous.    Your Inner Fish plots out the course of human evolution by showing what we have in common (and what dissimilarities we have) with other species.  Further, he shows how various human features have developed and where the branching off took place.  For example, the first chapter discusses the discovery of Tiktaalik, a species that occupied the transitional phase between water-dwellers and land-dwellers, when fins began to be replaced by limbs.  Thus, our arms and legs may have their origins in Tiktaalik.      Sense organs like the eyes and ears, the structure of our hands, in fact the general set-up of our body (head at the top, etc.) can all be seen in the fossil record.  And as is evident to most observers, we have more in common with primates than other mammals and more in common with mammals than with reptiles or birds.  Shubin shows why this is so.    In addition, Shubin explains how many of our ailments are the result of the limitations of evolution.  The same throat features that allows us to speak also creates the risk of sleep apnea and choking.  Hiccups, hernias, heart disease and obesity all have their origins in our evolutionary history.      Of course, the messages of this book would mean little if it wasn't well-written, but Shubin is able to get his ideas across with clarity and a generally light touch.  Your Inner Fish not only shows what makes us distinctly human, it also shows what we share with the rest of life on Earth.

The first concert was over 2 hours and kept me entertained every minute. The plus was that her son was in the audience and she sang a song directly to him. Simply wonderful. A must have for every Barbra Steisand fan.
