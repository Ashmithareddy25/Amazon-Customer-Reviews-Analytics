B0084IG8TM|4.0|`Hunger Games' Film has Bite<br /><br />New film The Hunger Games takes place in the distant future of a post-apocalyptic United States.  Apparently, an obliquely referred-to war/cataclysm has purportedly decimated world resources, especially regarding food-- and the country has been divided into 12 impoverished districts.  For seven decades, once a year, a lottery is held in which two children from each of the districts are chosen to participate in gladiatorial combat.  The conflict is, of course, to the death-- the sole survivor wins the lion's share of vital rations for their district, and one presumes, bragging rights.<br /><br />The film's heroine is the dramatically-named Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence.)  Katniss is quite adept in the use of a bow and arrow, with which she hunts animals for food and to earn money for the family--her mother apparently had a nervous breakdown when Katniss's father died in a coal-mining accident.  This year, district 12's female lottery \\"winner\\" is initially Katniss's younger sister, which prompts Katniss to volunteer in her place.  The male contestant from her district is Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), who harbors a long-dormant crush on Katniss.<br /><br />In an extended, perverted version of being fattened up before the slaughter, the combatants--some as young as 12--are given ornate costumes and literally paraded through the capital city (which seems to lack not at all for any resources), where they are interviewed by the cloying Games host (Stanley Tucci.)  Katniss finds sympathetic allies in her official clothier Cinna (Lenny Kravitz), and alcoholic combat mentor Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) who apparently survived the Games himself, decades ago.<br /><br />Peeta is strong of arm but otherwise unconvinced of his ability to survive the combat arena, a vast forest.  Naturally, every inch of it is rigged with video cameras, which broadcast even the most intimate of moments to the national audience.  \\"Winning sponsors\\" can occasionally get strategically delivered supplies to combatants.  Regardless, dozens of technicians in an operations room actively work equipment that manipulates the environment, causing fires and conjuring giant dogs to terrorize combatants lest they become too good at surviving (similar string-pulling tactics drove the plot of Cabin in the Woods.)<br /><br />Behind the curtains is Crane (Wes Bentley), an executive producer of sorts who serves at the pleasure of the President (Donald Sutherland.)  Embodying the ire of recent real-life political protests, Sutherland's leader knows the status quo he defends is immoral, and he is fully dedicated to maintaining its stark class divisions, with the games as its primary wedge.  Katniss's plucky charm threatens to rock the boat.<br /><br />As executed by director Gary Ross, the film functions as an extrapolation of Shirley Jackson's short story \\"The Lottery\\" and William Golding's youth-gone-feral \\"Lord of the Flies\\".  Genre viewers may also recall elements of \\"The Running Man\\" and \\"Logan's Run\\".  The original Games novel was the first in a trilogy by author Suzanne Collins.  If this first filmed adaptation is an indicator, the saga is off to a good start.nally get strategically delivered supplies to combatants.

B005LAIH3G|2.0|John Carter is a \\"B\\" movie with a big budget (bad acting and chesssyyy dialogues. I'm not surprised it did so bad in theaters. Disney, in fact, did fire the exec due to its failure....
B005LAJ23A|5.0|A lot of fans state that season 1 is better. Well, I'm here to tell you that they're wrong. Season 1 barely scratched the surface of the characters. And if you're just watching for the zombies then you should watch something else.<br /><br />Season 2 is the season that takes the characters to new places. Yes, I'll admit that the pacing dragged in some places but the pay off is well worth it. Here are the highlights of the season (potential spoilers ahead!):<br /><br />Shane - Whether you love him or hate him, Shane's self destruction throughout the season is riveting to watch. Jon Berthal was amazing and I'm sad that he got overlooked at the Emmys. This was his season in a lot of ways.<br /><br />Andrea - Another polarizing character, it is amazing watching her evolve to become such a strong person. Her fight to become self sufficent was sometimes frustrating but so rewarding in the end.<br /><br />Hershel & his family - Hershel and Maggie are great additions that help our characters grow and change. They especially affect Rick and Glenn. Glenn comes to realize his self-worth with Maggie's help. Hershel's unwillingness to accept the new world actually helps Rick come to terms with leaving behind his good guy/cop ways. Rick is going to be doing a whole different leadership next season (Ricktatorship 2012!).<br /><br />Daryl - You will be kind of shaken how far Daryl's character evolves from Season 1. I recently rewatched season 1 & I was amazed how calm he has become. This season shows how Daryl forms ties with the group that will definitely be threatened with the return of his brother.<br /><br />Best Episodes: Save the Last One (ep3), Chupacabra (ep5), Pretty Much Dead Already (ep7), the entire second half of the season (eps8-13)<br /><br />Best line that summed up the entire season: \\"The pain doesn't go away, you just make room for it\\"-Andrea<br /><br />So, if you enjoyed season 1 and welcome more character/survival drama then expect to enjoy this season even more.

The way the author tied in The Avett Brothers was very interesting too and got me to listen to some of their music (which my sister already enjoys!)

030758836X|4.0|Gone Girl is a portrait of marriage that will leave your jaw on the floor. It is the story of Nick and Amy, a couple who appears as stylish and compatible as Ken and Barbie on the surface. Amy goes missing on the day of their fifth wedding anniversary and what follows is a compulsively readable account of the search as doubt ramps up regarding Nick's innocence as well as a few supporting characters to keep things even more unpredictable.<br /><br />Part 1 lays the foundation of the novel. Nick is a handsome confident journalist born in Missouri. Amy is a writer, the stunningly beautiful cherished only child of two New York psychologists who make a hit children's book series about her. Their marriage is a worst case scenario of what occurs when two people nurse grievances and resentments over the years. Gillian Flynn expertly tugs on the common bad themes in marriage to draw the reader in. You will see glimpses of yourself in this novel and of your spouse. You will sympathize or shake your head in horror over each bad choice that Nick and Amy make--and maybe even shudder because of some of the uglier arguments you've had with your own spouse and feel thankful that they never escalated in such a manner.<br /><br />The author masterminds some impressive psychological and plotline-related gymnastics as she leads you through an impressive journey through the investigation of Amy's disappearance. Part 2 sheds new light on what happened to Amy. Then part 3 wraps it all up in a lengthy epilogue of sorts. I can't write a review on a novel this involved without being a little vague, but it is the most spine-tingling portrait of a sociopath I have ever read. You think constantly while reading this novel \\"BUT no one could possibly be this bad\\". However, if you've devoted yourself to a service career like healthcare or law enforcement, you probably have met people this damaged or maybe the hairs all stood up on the back of your neck when you were around them because intuition just told you even if you could never prove it.<br /><br />I gave the novel a solid 4 stars. I'm not going to lament the ending here as in many reviews I have read. The ending was as appropriate as any the author could have dreamed up. I was simply let down because I wanted a different end for the perpetrator. I expected a final detonation on this firecracker of a novel and instead I got the sensational the story was only beginning with increasingly tighter screws.<br /><br />There are adult themes such as violence, coarse language, and sex in the novel. It is compulsively readable. I read it continuously for two days. It was guiltily satisfying. Remember the Michael Douglas movie, War of the Roses? I like to think of Gone Girl as the War of the Roses for my generation.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The  Fifty Shades of Grey books have all three been great summer reads. For some people I think these books take you where you Desire, but don't Dare, or do you? For some it may bring out Painful Shortcomings in their own lives and for some it is The Dirty Little books we all seceretly smile about. The Trilogy reflected a little slow in the beginning but the development of Love made this book a great conclusion. All three books will stay with you, if only in your Dreams.

B003R0LBVW|3.0|The writer is excellent at combining social ideas and trends while building his characters. But despite a fairly good story and excellent ending, I almost put the book down because I dislike the characters depicted. I just couldn't sympathize with them. I kept thinking I was wasting my time with them.
0385534639|5.0|I loved this book. It's so descriptive I feel like I've actually been to the circus. I also love that it's not just a love story disguised as a magical book (aka twilight).  Yes the plot does contain a love story but the magical elements are all there and and it makes the book a great read
B005LAIHHC|3.0|\\"The Dictator,\\" Sacha Baron Cohen's most recent satire, portrays Admiral General Omar Aladeen, despotic ruler of the fictional North African country of Wadiya. \\"The Dictator\\" is scripted and doesn't contain the unanticipated \\"ambush\\" reactions of real, unsuspecting civilians that were a major part of his earlier pictures, \\"Borat\\" and \\"Bruno.\\" There is a sense of improvisation here and there, but the plot is fairly predictable.<br /><br />Aladeen comes to New York to address the United Nations, where his scheming uncle (Ben Kingsley) has him replaced by an easily controlled double and kidnapped to be tortured and killed. He manages to escape and eventually meets the proprietor of an organic foods store, Zoey (Anna Faris), who believes Aladeen is a dissident seeking political refuge.<br /><br />In ambush, hidden-camera pictures, editing builds the scene for maximum humor.  When a film is confined to the rigors of the written page, the script has to stand on its own. Too often in \\"The Dictator,\\" the jokes make you squirm, such as a toss-away gags about Aladeen's cousins \\"taking down\\" the Empire State Building.<br /><br />Baron Cohen, a master at instant characterizations, succeeds in making Aladeen a caricature but never bothers to make him a real person.  With his beard and zillion medals on a paramilitary uniform, Aladeen most closely parodies Libya's Muammar al-Gaddafi. That's not enough for a feature film, however, and the running time far exceeds the character's ability to elicit laughs.<br /><br />Some good visual gags notwithstanding, \\"The Dictator\\" is not Sacha Baron Cohen's finest. He is far less successful in getting laughs here than when he points his hidden camera at real people and draws out their bigotry, prejudices, and dark thoughts.<br /><br />The \\"Banned and Unrated\\" two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack contains a digital copy, several deleted and extended scenes, a Larry King interview with Baron Cohen in character as Aladeen, and a music video. \\"The Dictator\\" is also available in a single-disc DVD edition.

B0029QRA1U|3.0|If you look at the other three-star reviews, you'll get a pretty good idea of the problem. The hardware is a good basic turntable. The software is a pain. It clips off parts of songs. It divides songs into tracks poorly. There is no provision for noise removal.<br /><br />Here's my solution: I run the captured audio into Audacity. If you look under preferences in Audacity, you can see an \\"input from USB codec\\" setting. Choose it. Capture the audio, and clean up the noise. Mark the beginning of tracks with CTRL B. Then save the audio as multiple mp3s into the file you choose. Bring the tracks into Media Monkey and add the track and album information there. It's a little bit more work than the software that comes with the turntable, but the final product is much better.

It expanded out from the original story to include a story of a city, a guy selling air, the boy and the love of his life, and more about the Once-ler.  I just loved this movie.
1401923127|2.0|\\"Biology of Belief\\" lives up to the  promise of interesting biology but not the promise that it would have anything meaningful to add to the question of belief.  At least author Bruce Lipton has the good grace to confine his \\"belief\\" nonsense to an epilogue rather than elevate it to the level of the scientifically interesting material by including it as an actual chapter.  I would have realized the title was misleading if had paid attention to the subtitle \\"Unleashing the Power of Consciousness, Matter and Miracles.\\"  What was I thinking???

B005LAIIQC|4.0|&#34;The Bourne Legacy&#34; is an artful attempt to add to the Bourne movie series by taking the story sideways. A secret project called Outcome has improved on the super-agents of the original Project Treadstone through chromosomal manipulation. We meet one of its products, Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner), on survival training in Alaska, as the movie begins. As the movie unspools, we further learn that Cross's agency has decided to terminate the Outcome project with extreme prejudice, due to the unfavorable publicity of Jason Bourne's struggle with the CIA.<br /><br />In a suspenseful action sequence, Cross will survive a termination attempt in Alaska and escape. Inside the Outcome Laboratory, somewhere near Washington DC, Doctor Marta Shearing (Rachel Waitz) and her co-workers are also assaulted. Marta survives the attack in the lab, only to be pursued to her home in the country. In a second very good action sequence, Marta will be forced to trust her rescuer Cross and to face the consequences of her scientific work. Cross and Marta will go on the run to the Philippines, with Outcome in close pursuit, paving the way for a final, frenetic chase sequence in crowded Manila.<br /><br />&#34;The Bourne Legacy&#34; features a number of well-executed action sequences. Renner and Waitz make a good team and are backed by a strong supporting cast, including Edward Norton and Stacy Keach. However, &#34;Legacy&#34; never quite achieves the compelling, suspensefully paranoid atmosphere of the original Jason Bourne movies. The heart of the mystery has already been given away, while the uneven pacing, the simplicity of the plot device that drives Cross's sense of urgency, and the flat ending were a little disappointing.  &#34;The Bourne Legacy&#34; is entertaining but not quite in the class of its predecessors.

B004EPYZT4|3.0|Alright, the movie wasn't the best, but it wasn't the worst I've ever seen.... it was OK.  Good action... a little gory at times.  Of course, Jason Mimoa is gorgeous!  I guess the acting by all was about the best it could be for this type of movie.  I MUST MENTION, THOUGH, THAT LEO HOWARD WHO PLAYED YOUNG CONAN IS FANTASTIC!  I knew nothing about him but, when watching the movie, I felt that he must have had some martial arts training.... I googled him and sure enough he started training when he was 4... and is a champion.  That kid is bad-@#$ss and it showed!  I think great things are in store for him.  One thing I really didn't like about the movie was the gratuitous nudity that wasn't necessary to the plot... but, I guess guys won't watch a movie without it????!  The movie makers sure seem to think so....  Overall, the movie was better than I had expected it to be and I think it's worth watching for the fun of it!
0345803485|1.0|This book was given to me by a friend.  Since its all the rage right now I dove in. This has got to be the worst written, most ridiculous book I have read in a long long time.

Oh please...do you know anyone who does this?  So stupid...beyond...

B000QCS8TW|5.0|If you like stories based on medevial times, Knights and Ladies fair, dragons and heroic adventures then these books are for you. This is the first book in the series and it will introduce all the characters to you. I finished the first book in three days, I literally could not put it down. A small bit of advice.....do not purchase the \\"set\\", get the individual books. If you are like me and sometimes want to search back to clarify a point, it is easier to do with the individual books. The set is one big volume and is not easy to search.
1469984202|4.0|Yet another dystopia, but set in an interesting underground world.  The oddness of things are explained later on, as is the case in a lot of sci-fi. As the story gets going it gets more and more interesting.  Reads almost like a movie script.  The world he creates is fairly realistic, and very close to plausible.<br /><br />  I was hoping for more of a post-oil, ruined earth thing, but its a little different than that.  Not a whole lot of science, and some of the science didn't seem to pan out. I was also hoping for a more mysterious explanation, or no explanation at the end.  A little disappointing but not terrible ending.<br /><br />****SPOILER:  If this scenario did in fact happen to us, which is very well could, I think it would be due to overpopulation, pollution, maybe war. But NOT some sorta kill-the-world cult.  I found that just a little too bizarre. (Scientology?) By the way, wouldn't the silo simply run out of oil in a year or so?  Water and food is doable, maybe.  But power and sickness and air would be the big problems.  Also I would think that people would simply forget about the outside.  If your life underground is going ok, you would eventually stop thinking about the top.  The view up there is far from, \\"lets go for a walk\\" inspiring.<br /><br />Kept me turning the pages, and the world it built sticks in my head, so I give it a good review.<br /><br />If you have claustrophobia this book is not for you! :D
B008NXL7DA|4.0|Original, sure, though Chapter 12 may have been an experiment too far. A latterday Evelyn Waugh, as unnerving and exhilarating as he must have seemed back in the day, with more empathy and an infectious youthful vibe - 'to herself, she's already a costume designer'; Egan is pushing 50! - and heaps better than the unfortunate Franzen potboiler that vied equally for our attention last year. Interesting that they're both fourth novels featuring rock musicians; both have traumatic excretory scenes (what is it with you Americans and bodily odours? love me, love my farts); finally, both incorporate third-person commentary/narrative by an existing character (I hate to speak ill of the dead but I love Egan's spoof David Foster Wallace footnotes) and (yuk) sport. A detail: Franzen may think (and doesn't he just) but Egan now - she can write. This is wicked, yet with sound psychological grounding; Egan's characters don't pretend to be *real*, so we are free to believe in them; we care for them. Not as good as Love in Infant Monkeys (but what is?) it probably deserved the Pulitzer for its young/old crossover feel, including the teen of Ch 12. (I take it back about Ch 12.) Egan's fractured and chronologically quirky fragments are an honest attempt to represent our haphazard, often broken lives (think atonality, think cultural miscegination, think family breakdown and loss of the public space) while Franzen's relentless, pedestrian, interminably distended naturalism gets thinner the further it's stretched and ends up feeling, well, cartoonish<br /><br />One more thing: Egan's males are more convincing, and Franzen's females; what are we to make of this?
B008M34CSI|4.0|Fast paced action.  Set in the future but not a totally unbelievable future.  A few scenes are overly computer-generated and some plot twists are predictable.  Over all it is good action movie.  My wife and I enjoyed it.

0345803485|1.0|I have only read about 20 pages.  The language was so dreadful (the original English) that I gave up.  It upsets me that a book of this quality is being hyped to the heavens.  I never got to the 'interesting mummy porn', but was bogged down in the hot steely glances, etc.  The style of language jumped from place to place - teenager in the 60s, then 21st century adult and so on. Sorry, but I will not be reading it.<br />The local press today asked 10 female personalities (authors, artists, journalists) what they thought of the book and NONE of them had read it, but all of them had an opinion about it.

B006R1T40I|5.0|This woman can do no wrong; another brilliant, flawless album by one of the most accomplished and treasured musicians alive today. Bonnie Raitt has a flair for writing great tunes and astutely picking songs by other artists that she can put her own personal musical stamp on them. Case in point, is Gerry Rafferty's \\"Right Down the Line\\" on this album. Sumptuous stuff. Ignore the gaudy album cover and just buy this one. Outstanding tunes from an artist that STILL sounds vital and full of energy. Forget the \\"fountain of youth,\\" this music is the tonic for everlasting life. Longtime fans of Bonnie Raitt NEED to get this album. It's not just good, it's excellent.
0345803485|3.0|Horrible writing, shallow characters, and sex in a novel is only erotic when it is unexpected. We know Christian and Ana are going to do it every time they look at each other.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Book 2 of the 50 Shades of Grey has more excitement than the sexual. There's alot that goes on in this book, that you don't want to put it down as you can't wait to see what happens next. Again I love these books..
B005KP7EK4|5.0|As a fan and expert of the Western genre all my life, gotta say I love this movie. I think both Sam Shepard and Mr. Noriega were outstanding in their acting. While the story is not historically plausible, what Western is? The fact is both the story and the flashback scenes to the glory days of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid was outstanding. If you love Westerns, you will love this movie!!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I purchased all three books to see what the big deal was about them. I had heard great things and horrible things. What I found was I loved them. Yes the sex can be over the extreme, but the storyline of the whole book is great. Leaves you wanting more. Others have commented on the poorly written I myself found myself so lost in the what's gonna happen next, that I didn't notice the writing itself. The book had me at chapter 5 to the very end. I can't wait for more books for the 50 Shades.

0062059882|1.0|Wow, what a disappointment. I was familiar with this author only from his Sandman work and was expecting big things from this much-hyped novel which sadly did not deliver. In brief, the story is about Shadow, a man who has been in prison. Upon his release he is approached by a stranger who hires him as his chauffeur/goon. I won't give away any plot points--if they can be called that--but I will warn the reader that this is 562 very, very long pages that had this reader bored witless by page 18. By page 90 I had pretty well figured out, in a general way, how this would end; there was nothing left but a long slog to show myself that I had guessed correctly (I had) and a lingering feeling of having wasted my time. I find it rather sad that the author dedicated this book in part to the late Roger Zelazny. I've read Zelazny, and he was a master. He would have packed this book into 180 breathless pages and made you want to burst into tears of bereavement when it was over. It is too bad that the author of this book didn't learn more from his example. Here is my advice to anyone who is tempted to read this: Search out a short story called \\"Meeting Mr. Subian.\\" (I understand that the story has been made into a film, but I am not familiar with it). In a few short pages, the author of that story encapsulated this entire book. Can't find the story? Imagine a long and tedious road trip through a lot of grey little towns full of grey little people, accompanied by people who are strange, difficult, selfish, manipulative and violent. You'll have this, without the 562 page slog. Was there any meat to it? Yes, but it was said in one line by General Smedley Butler a long time ago. If you need something to read, buy Butler's book; you'll get more out of it.
0823015017|3.0|I do not buy books I cannot preview.  Most authors do this, and if the book is good enough, artists and novices alike will buy it.  I do understand the fear of having one's work copied or stolen, however, buying a book like this is can be a waste of money if you can't see at least see the table of contents.  Too much repetition with clay books.

B000SINT52|1.0|This was the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm not one to believe everything I see, so I researched most of the \\"facts\\" in the movie, and I haven't found anything true. Michael Moore takes pieces of interviews and pieces them together to make this fake story. Don't waste your money on this movie. Even the story line is boring.

B006OCM0G0|5.0|ok so I like this game it's simple and fun but seriously? Just because they ask for money? THEIR A COMPANY THATS WHAT THEY DO TO GET MONEY!

Its that simple and it's nit hard so quit being babies. Nuff said.
B002OHK7CS|1.0|no doubt inspired by the few - pretty much laughable - chapters from the 'gangland' series, this show tries REALLY hard to bridge that gap between the outlaw biker and the more palatable law-'abiding' version.  which makes this tailor-made fantasy the perfect vehicle (see how i just did that?) for yuppie fanboys all over amerika    during the boom years while the world financial institutions were building a really really pretty house o' cards, successful male yuppies - and those not so successful but living waaaaaay beyond their means thanks to visa & mastercard - were pretending to be biker bad-asses all over the midwest.  these weekend poseurs were easily recognized cause when they weren't riding their ridiculously overpriced fantasies (and ONLY on sunny days), they walked around in groups that looked like a harley accessory catalog vomited all over them.  this audience has been decades in the making, and now their series has come.  add some orange county chopper old-school father vs. new-school son style bickering, and these desperate yuppies can now squeal like school girls at the pretend antics and struggles o' a fictitious mc club's old ways w/ the 'visionary' direction o' modern sensitve-tough-guy progeny o' the club's founder.  throw in some really BAD rolling stones covers - cause, you know, altamont and s*** - and the manufactured glories o' unflinching individualism astride perhaps the most inconvenient - not to mention vulverable - form o' transport for a modern outlaw is ready to wow legions o' pot-bellied lawyers and dentists who crave xtended mid-life crisis'    where's the series on greenpeace, or the earth first movement?  no, they're criminals......while gun-dealing, drug-selling, porn-producing boys on motorized bicycles is somehow legitimate drama.  it's no wonder why this series is one o' the most popular in rupert murdoch's media empire - but then there's never been any actual accounting for taste among that crowd..........................

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I chose the MicroShell Folio cover for my Kindle fire because it seemed like a good compromise between bulk and protection. Overall it is, but it is a little thin. I wish they had made it just a little thicker with a little more protective padding. It is also rather pricey when you see how thin it is. If I needed another cover, I would look to see if there was something better. If I could not find something thicker but still relatively compact, then I would buy it again.

The clarity is amazing, especially considering the time period these albums were recorded in.<br /><br />Audio notes at the end of some pieces, are very helpful and fun.  (They used real canons and artillery guns in one album.)<br /><br />having 50 albums to choose from gives us an opportunity to play old favorites and discover new.<br /><br />The delivery of the set was very prompt, it was only two days from the day it was ordered.<br /><br />This is the first time we have ordered from Amazon, it will not be the last.

0307744434|5.0|This book arrived with no warning ( taking the line from the book that I love, instead of saying book it says circus) , as you know from my previous book review, I judge books by their covers, if the covers interest me, I am interesting to see what is written inside.<br /><br />  While reading this book, you follow many different people, and at first it is confusing how they all go together. But once their stories do intertwine it does get very interesting. I found that from page 213 on , this book was entertaining. So many things happen that you were sure wouldn't/couldn't happen.  So many things happen that you would have never guessed to happen.<br /><br />  The details are magical and out of this world.  Picturing everything in my imagination makes me want to see a movie of this book, if they can capture the scene as well as it is written.  The talks of trees with candles dangling from them that grant wishes, to illusions that only appear as staged but are in fact real. This book took my imagination on a crazy tour of the circus back in the late 1800's to early 1900's.<br /><br />  Mixing reality with mystical magic.  I defiantly would recommend anyone this book, if you give it a chance, the beginning is very information and after you get that down, the fun starts! I could not help but see the movies that I love,  \\" The Greatest Show on Earth\\" and the The Prestige  being put together, it has the circus feel of the Greatest Show on Earth and the dark mystery of The Prestige. SO BASICALLY if you like those two movies READ this book, or watch the MOVIES and then read this book :)<br /><br />check out more reviews of mine at my blog.... alixandriabeauty.blogspot

1451648537|3.0|Any life story of this great man is already intriguing reading.  I am, however, disappointed that Isaacson has only done a mediocre job of writing up this biography.  He is long-winded and unfocused, quite the opposit of everything that Jobs stands for.<br /><br />At the end of chapter 41, when Isaacson came to the end of Jobs's life story, he said, 'But when I asked how it really felt to be relinquishing control of the company he had built, his tone turned wistful, and he shifted into the past tense. \\"I've had a very lucky career, a very lucky life,\\" he replied. \\"I've done all that I can do.\\"'  Grammatically, of course, Jobs was speaking in the present perfect tense, not the past tense.  Furthermore, from a writer's point of view, it would have been much more powerful if Isaacson had referred to Jobs's final remark as given in the present perfect tense.  Not only would that be the grammtaically correct thing to say, but a 'present perfect' would have been a much more fitting conclusion to a perfectionist's life.
0545123275|5.0|So, I have to start off by saying that the book blurb is absolutely horrible. Siblings? Really? And I'm supposed to find that attractive in a romance? Thank goodness there is no hint to that type of relationship between them in the actual book!<br /><br />There were some very strong points that had me loving the book so much that I was able to put aside the frustrating and over used YA scenarios. The first is Stiefvater's beautiful poetry. It's spread throughout the novel and truly captures the essence of what the characters are feeling and how their worlds are changing. The second is that, despite this riding the coat tails of Werewolf craze courtesy of the Twilight phenom, it was a unique take on werewolves. I didn't feel like I was having to read someone's version of Jacob's story. I was completely absorbed into Sam and Grace's lives. The final thing I loved (actually two things) is the cover and book trailer. Both are so beautiful. The cover isn't depressing, or try too hard, and the trailer gave me chills. Although, it makes much more sense if you watch it after reading the book.<br /><br />So what didn't I like? Well, here come the over used YA scenarios. Good girl meets bad boy, who really has a heart of gold and would die for her. Boy obsesses over girl that never notices him, until one day that randomly changes. Girl's parents are artsy and completely uninterested in her life, not even noticing that her boyfriend now lives with them. Girl and boy immediately (upon finally noticing the other) realize this is their soul mate.<br /><br />Like I said, lots of over used scenarios, but if you can get past that and simply enjoy the beautifully lyrical writing of Stiefvater this is a very enjoyable read. Make sure you go in with the knowledge that it is a trilogy and don't expect complete closure at the end of this one.

B0059XTUVI|3.0|I thought the film was better than some of the reviews here implied but the focus of the film was obviously a showcase for Streep.  This is one of her best performances.  Is there a bad Streep performance?  No.  But she absolutely knocked me out.  On screen for the whole film with the exception of the younger actress playing Thachter, Streep once again proves, her talent as an actress is really unsurpassed by any of the other respected ladies of today.  In fact she's damn historical.  She becomes the character in her films and here she leaves no room for the competition.  I really do not recall any other actress playing an elderly woman with such grace and technique seemlessly connecting the middle aged woman to the hardly frail elderly woman Thachter became.  Unbelievable talent.  She morphs herself into Thacter.  I was sorry to see the film end.

B007SGM084|4.0|This book is NOT for anyone under 18 due to explict language and scenarios. I like the was the book ended but had to get through the garbage first. The author is a good writer overall and captures the readers attention. Without giving anything away, it is an easy read but not for everyone.
B000UJ48VI|2.0|captivated by how 1962 could adequately portray a sensitive pedophile with competition from a menacing one...  Sue is perfect in her powerful role to seize the day via male manipulation.... if Stanley had his way, one wonders what scenes he envisioned, even by todays standards this is one of the creepiest attempts to evoke sympathy for a social deviant with limited consequences... even Quilty is laughing at his own demise, surprised he didn't impersonate a 12yo for Humbait... plot did leave me hanging with the vehicle stalking that was a different model than the one at the gas station and the unexpected U Turn, not sure I recommend this for anyone, Sellers is more appropriately showcased in Strangelove, Winters in Poseidon or Anne Frank, as for Mason, ANYTHING but this drivel....

076790382X|4.0|This is my third Bill Bryson book, and I intend to buy more. I buy the audio versions, which is narrated by the author himself. As a frequently listener of audio books, I enjoy his narration as his voice and metric is not only pleasant, but adds subtle nuances to the storytelling. I have gathered from other books that Bill is on the left side of the political fence. That's perfectly fine. I'm from the right, but it does not stop me from enjoying his books. His book about Australia (In a Sunburned Country) was almost entirely political neutral, so whatever ideological differences we have were irrelevant. This book (I'm a Stranger Here Myself) was very enjoyable until he decided to cut into Americans who oppose illegal immigration, own a gun, or believe in a strong national defense. Incredibly, in the very next chapter, he brags about living in safe, clean, friendly part of the country that's free of crime (and although he does not say this, it's also the whitest part of the country). I wonder how his views would change if he lived in southern California for a while. Anyway, the book is funny and enjoyable, but I wasn't expecting a one-sided political debate.

B001DF68MA|5.0|I still don't know what the differences are between the regular WeeRide and this LTD one, but who cares, it was only about $20 difference in price. I installed it on two of my bikes, a Schwinn Trailway and a Trek DS 8.5, and both fit great. I had to use the longer included screws for the Trek.<br /><br />My daughter is a few days from her six month birthday. The instructions said this is not recommended for children under one, but my daughter is in the 90th percentile for her weight and length, so I decided to take a chance and buy this early. I'm glad I did, because she loves it. I used my phone to video her expression as we rode, and it is so precious. It's probably just me, but now when she sees me walk in the room, she gives me a big toothless smile and giggle. I think the WeeRide has helped me form a special bond with my daughter.<br /><br />My wife is very short, so her bike frame is too short for the WeeRide. It's ok, because she can barely stay on the bike by herself.<br /><br />I wish the back came up a little higher, there was a small handle bar that my daughter can hold onto, and a strap to keep the front shoulder straps close together so it doesn't slip off her shoulders. This is a great invention. Go out and get one, you won't regret it. Unless you fall off the bike with your child strapped into it. But that's a different issue.
0345803485|2.0|There is nothing even slightly realistic about the story.  Everyone is in love with Ana, and even though the author describes her as average, and Ana thinks of herself as average, everyone else sees her as beautiful and special and is dying to date her (of course).  And of course, the most ideal but deeply complicated man swoops in and sees something in her he hasn't seen in anyone else and opens up and does things he would never do with another.  If this man was so complicated, it would take so much longer than two weeks to \\"open  up\\" as much as he did.  But of course, that's because Ana is just super-special. Christian is a self-made billionaire at 27 but never seems to work much (does this ever happen other than Mark Zuckerberg?).  Ana is a very one-dimensional character..she doesn't discuss much about her thoughts or interests on anything other than Christian and guys in general.  All we know is she likes to read books.  Oh and she can't be submissive.  But of course, this is the girl the complicated georgeous billionaire who isn't interested in dating goes for?  Please.<br /><br />The author constantly has everyone grinning and everyone's eyes twinkling...he gives a wolfish grin, he gives a wicked grin, she grins, her eyes twinkling, his eyes twinkling wickedly.  Really, a wolfish grin?  Oh and the hair...as he tucks a tendril behind my ear, she tucks a tendril behind her ear, she has falling tendrils around her face, he runs his hands through his hair, I want to run my hands through his hair, blah, blah.  And the inner goddess?  Come on, seriously?  My inner goddess is cheering with her pom pons?  Was this oringinally supposed to be a pre-teen novel?  The author brings up details that are irrelevant...eg, \\"I drank a glass of water with cranberry, it was refreshing and quenched my thirst.\\" Why is this necessary or important to write?  She has done this several times throughout the book, and it was irritating to read.<br /><br />Plus, I can tell it's a British author trying to sound American. She made some vocabulary gaffes like saying holiday, rucksack, ring instead of call, starters instead of appetizers, bit instead of part, etc.  This is secondary...but we don't go around saying, \\"Whoa, he's so freaking HOT!\\"  No.  She tried so hard with all the silly slang, it made the characters sound phony and cartoonish.<br /><br />I was really excited to read this book...but so disappointed after the first few chapters.  I liked the idea of a dark, complicated romance... but the writing style was so amateur I couldn't help but roll my eyes at nearly every page.

1594745692|5.0|Wow! what a really well drawn deck this is. Made me laugh as I was looking them over & getting a feel for them. I think the death card is one of my favorites (I know, that sounded morbid, but if you saw the picture on it & the detail you'd see what I mean). I really like this deck alot & one of the main things for any reader, or even if you're just starting out, is to get a deck that \\"calls to you\\". I have around 30 decks now & this is most definitely one of my favorites. I applaud the designer for the artwork & detail. The only thing that I wish was worked on more though is the feel of the cards themselves. They feel ever so slightly on the thin side, I wish they would feel a bit more stronger & thicker. I'm going to be using these cards quite frequently & it would be nice to know that they'll hold up & last a good long while. Other than that, great deck, thank you.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Buy this knife! It is the heaviest duty survival knife I have ever used! I was trained in USAF SERE, and I can tell you that there is nothing you can do to break this knife without breaking yourself in the process.<br />Cons:(1)The sheath is useless! I had to make a sheath for mine, but there are other commercial sheath options for the BK-2. (2)Without PROPER care this knife will rust where the steel has been exposed by use and sharpening when used in wet/coastal environments.<br />Pros: 1/4\\" thick full tang blade out to almost the very tip, so you can throw it, hack with it, pry with it, and baton with it until you cannot lift your arms! The Rockwell temper of the carbon steel blade make it easy to sharpen, but not easy to dull. The handle is by far the most comfortable I have ever used. This knife is useful for fine whittling as well because of the blade design. The price is by far lower than what it is worth, but don't go telling Ka-Bar. I've found this knife to be useful in food prep too, but it's not my first choice for food prep as it is quite thick and is not a very handy slicer. If you're a Big Game hunter the BK-2 is a great choice for field dressing and caping/skinning. This is not a child's knife, nor is it for people with smaller hands (I'm talking like a ten year old sized hands, or petite people) and arms as this knife has good weight to it, 16oz. and would be exhausting to manage for smaller folks. Buy it now before the price goes up!

In closed shoes I am a 8 1/2 and I should have ordered these in a 9. Overall, the foot bed of these shoes is WONDERFUL.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|We all know about the psychopath with whom we are dealing with at work. We certainly are well aware of the psychopaths who are politicians. What happens when we come to the realization that our child may in fact, be a psychopath?<br /><br />This is the situation that Andy Barber, an assistant district attorney with intense knowledge of the criminal character, with a father serving prison time for murder, and a teenage son accused of killing a classmate must face. For a long time (perhaps never) does this father ever believe that this often angry, inscrutable,  while only occasionally, vulnerable growing man-child is capable of having committed the awful crime for which he is soon accused.<br /><br />Other books have been written about parents facing the same dilemma. In one sense perhaps, it is the dilemma each of us faces when we are confronted with facts leading to conclusions which we do not wish to acknowledge. Eventually, those who first find every reason to agree with father are presented with what appear to be compelling reasons to change their thinking. Throughout the book, we see Jacob's mother, Laurie come to first have whispering doubts and then deep suspicions that perhaps her son has indeed, dark secrets he is hiding. In the end, you the reader, must make your own decision. Forced to follow the complex twists and turns of this compelling story, you will find it as difficult as I did to put this book down, before its totally unexpected ending.
B005LZW8FO|5.0|This is a film to touch your heart and make your mind race at the same time. We wonder at roads not taken and what we would say to another version of us. I loved this film. I was fascinated. I was entertained. I was not wanting it to end.
B00005214X|5.0|I was a senior in high school when this record came out, and I confess that my buddies, my girlfriend and I spent many summer days languishing in assorted basement locations listening to this great album. George Harrison's music finally surged to the fore-front, even on the radio, and his tender lyrics of love, of praising God and his sweet sense of humor were refreshing then, and still move me today. His version of Bob Dylan's \\"If Not For You\\" brought a lump to my throat upon hearing it again. The list of musicians involved will astound you: Eric Clapton, Bobby Whitlock, and a very young Phil Collins on percussion. A must-have for the classic-rock collection.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This has some semi-challenging games that will keep you busy and entertained for however long you may need. Very fun to play
B005DA63EY|5.0|A good movie, with twists and turns. Mathew M. needs to stick with the lawyer roles he does an excellent job in this movie as he did in a Time To Kill.
0345803493|5.0|Im not much of a reader, but reading FIFTY SHADES OF GREY I couldnt put it down and I had to read the other 2 books FIFTY SHADES DARKER and FIFTY SHADES FREED. I loved it. I wish there was more and didnt have to stop with just the 3 books. I would rec amend everyone to read it.
B000EQ47GS|3.0|Sounded good to me.  This releases' liner notes includes a very interesting history that could not have been written upon the release of this album.  Well, it wouldn't have come with the 8-track even if it had or could have, but it couldn't have.  And it didn't.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|my son is obsessed with it.  looks forward to egg hatchings and being able to expand his village.  The scratch game is his favorite.

1932100660|5.0|This book was recommended by my boyfriend's doctor as a reasonable diet to incorporate one's life for optimal health. It is a result of a comprehensive study. We are reading it presently.
B005LAIIQC|1.0|The movie literally was like watching a lame Chinese copy of Bourne. The pacing was extremely off. Tony Gilroy, the same person that directed Michael Clayton, directed this film. Trust me, it felt like you are watching Michael Clayton, if you've ever seen it. As typical with indie directors that cannot make action films, the action scenes were very amateur and poorly executed. I'm quite sure this was not the movie Universal was expecting. It honestly felt like an arthouse film. It could have been saved with massive editing. Honestly, I can't ever recommend watching this film. The acting was superb, I will let that be clear. However, this should have had the Bourne name taken off. It's a disgrace to the franchise.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Gone Girl!  We read it for our book club, and I can't wait for the discussion.  I loved how it was presented from the two different sides of the story.  I can't say I loved the ending, but it certainly kept me on my toes until the end.  Highly recommended!
0439023521|5.0|I feel everyone has fantasized about this scenario one time or another. It did a very good job in keeping the audience entertained.  The pace was spot on and just an all around good book... I highly recommend this to anyone.  High five stars and hoped the last two books were just as good
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I was disappointed with how it turned out!  There was so much suspense and then it seemed to peter out and the constant flash backs at the end, made it kinda hard to follow!

B000QCS8TW|4.0|I was not into fantasy books until I read Game Of Thrones several years ago. The Song Of Ice And Fire series changed my reading expectations forever. I now expect that every chapter should end with intrigue, that anti-heroes are actually hero's, main characters are replaceable with secondary characters and that profanity, rape and child abuse can be artfully incorporated into a story. Thanks for changing it all George.
B008GJV056|5.0|Not much more to say.....if you're a Will Ferrell fan, you'll love it and if you're not a Ferrell fan, you'll probably hate it.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I can't believe it's been 5 years since Feast For Crows. I do not want to be critical of GRRM because it does take time to write something as great as ASOIAF. In fact, I hope that there will be more books in addition to the ones that have already been planned... I will be sad when it all ends.<br />The story moves forward a little in this book, although at least half the book is written in parallel time to Feast For Crows but with different characters.<br />Once again GRRM has included story line clues (i.e. Melissandre's prediction that John will be stabbed in the dark) for us to identify. I know I've missed some clues so I'll be re-reading Dance With Dragons again. I just hope that we won't have to wait another 5 years for the next book even though I know that it too will be worth the wait.
0307352145|5.0|About one third to one half of our world is made up of introverted people. In \\"Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking\\" Susan Cain explains what introverts are and what they are not, while also explaining the traits of extroverts in comparison. She helps readers understand how to better include introverts in places such as workplaces and schools by showing them ways they can be opened up and participate more, to include them more often in our virtually extroverted world. The book starts out with a story about Rosa Parks. She is described as a quiet, introverted person who made a huge difference in our country by using her quiet voice to speak up at the right time and in the right way. Many more stories and studies are shared throughout this book about other \\"quiet\\" people, people who have made a difference in our world.<br /><br />What really got my attention in this book is that introverts tend to be sensitive people, although not all of them are. Other important points were that introverted people usually need to take small steps in participating with social groups (arrive early at parties to find their \\"space\\" instead of arriving later and trying to find their \\"space\\" in the group), over-arousal causes introverts to feel that they have had enough and would like to be free from the situation, under-arousal causes extroverts to feel restless, sluggish like they want to get out of the house. Loud noises bother introverts more than extroverts, sometimes causing them not to perform as well, while quiet conditions tend to make extroverts bored. We need reflection in our world and introverts are often very good at that because they are often inward \\"thinkers\\".  At the same time, we also need extroverts in our world because they are often the people that are experts at being in front of people to present ideas and information. There are also some introverts in our world who are actually disguising themselves to be extroverts, causing those people to feel drained more often than they would if they were not disguising themselves.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anybody that wants a better understanding of the differences with introverted and extroverted people. I also recommend this to people who want to try to make the world a better place from the knowledge that is gained in understanding the differences that are needed in our world from both introverts and extroverts.<br /><br />Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a complimentary copy of this book from Waterbrook Multomah through their blogger's book review program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|The story has grown in scope. In this installment of ASOIAF series we are introduced to the world beyond the Wall, Dorne and the Free Cities across the sea. This book in particular requires a re-read to identify the many story line clues and predictions that GRRM has left for us. GRRM has invented a rather fun and interesting game that engages the reader. I like it !!
B006JPS1OM|1.0|This is a very boring game and you do little in the way of fun. This game is quite frankly STUPID. Don't bother I regret even getting it for free
B000FC1HBY|4.0|If you've already read A Game Of Thrones than there is nothing more to say... just carry on and enjoy the exceptional series that GRRM has created.<br />If you have not read A Game Of Thrones then what are you waiting for ?<br />Read it NOW !!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|the game is fun and meets most hack and slash needs though gaining gems should be possible other than purchasing

B0058ZPNOK|5.0|Hesher is probably a thousand times better than I went in expecting.  Not that I expected a terrible film by any means especially after reading an enticing description, but I never would have guessed the quality of the storytelling is *this* extremely high.<br /><br />It's basically about a little boy who gets into trouble by picking fights with older kids and bullies, and in one instance, throws a rock through the window of a young long-haired, lazy, disrespectful heavy metal-loving lowlife that the kid had no right messing with (and who soon becomes the lead character in the movie named Joseph Gordon-Levitt).  As soon as he throws the rock, the man comes out of the house and yanks the kid back inside.  Then the cops arrive so the guy terroizes and surprises the kid by throwing a grenade through the broken window at the cop!  Joseph's character apparently has no concern for the after effects of his actions and throughout the movie manages to escape every tricky and potentially risky stunt he pulls.<br /><br />There's SO many things that occur throughout this movie that just screams interesting, exciting and enticing around every single corner that it'd be unfair to list them all and therefore spoil the film, so let's just say Joseph's character invites himself into the home of the boy one day, lives there, does whatever he wants, and the father and grandmother of the little boy just assume the man is a friend of their son/grandson, lol.  It's really bizarre and yet, ultimately fascinating.  From here, well, the little boy has TWO problems now.  The bully at school who's waiting for the perfect chance to tear the kid apart for writing offensive remarks on his car, and dealing with the long-haired man that suddenly decides to make himself at home and picks on the boy himself.  Poor kid!<br /><br />There wasn't a single second that I turned away in boredom while watching Hesher.  Constant storyline unpredictability and creativity occurred the entire time and that's arare accomplishment in todays world.  There's also the segment with the cashier lady at the downtown grocery store played by Natalie Portman that the little boy has a crush on, so certain scenes develop between the two of them.  Not necessarily relationship-type segments that you're probably thinking, but more like, well, adventures.  Little awkward adventures around town, shall we say!<br /><br />Some may argue there's not really a point to all these crazy and adventurous events that take place between the little boy, the Joseph's character, the school bully (who also works at the car shop and finds himself involved with the little boy there as well), Natalie Portman's character, the boys father and the boys grandmother.  But I have to disagree, thanks to the ending.  There most certainly is a point, though perhaps not the one you're leaning towards.  A point that comes out of left field.<br /><br />Still, a satisfying conclusion to a very different type of drama story with light touches of comedy, though you probably have to be someone who's not concerned for constant swearing and lots of direct sexual-related talk (even though there's no actual nudity present anywhere).  It's true the language is somewhat offensive in a few segments (especially the one involving Natalie and Joseph's character sitting in a car and talking about sex in a really graphic way before Natalie even introduces herself- Joseph comes across as totally disrespectful the way he talks to the girl in such a tasteless way) but other than that, I'm happy with the film overall.  Wonderful example of originality.
B003YL4KS0|5.0|I heard a lot about the \\"curly girl method\\" via youtube and I wanted a little more background info about it.  This book really helps make sure you do the best that you can do for your hair to keep it healthy.  I read through the whole book just to get knowledge about other curly girls as well so I can give out recommendations.  I do have some friends who also have curly hair and I love that they come to me for advice on products.  I owe it all to this book :)

B007VUA7VO|2.0|I hate it, its worthless all it does is tell you the percent of battery u have left but my tablet already tells me
0099579936|2.0|Uh. I had pretty much the same experience as \\"W. K.\\" here. The book is not for everyone.<br /><br />The characters are poorly developed, lack much background, and you can spot that the author is just waiting to jump into the explicit scenes because the beginning wasn't done well. At first, the story proves entertaining, but later just becomes an unrealistic waste. Are we supposed to believe that these people live in a world with no intervention, no barriers? Doesn't it seem strange that they have absolutely no conflicts with the outside world, no debt, and are able to be so successful at such young ages? That is when I really began to see that this was just a poor man's \\"Twilight\\". (As mentioned here on Amazon, the author actually developed this out of a much briefer fanfiction she wrote based on \\"Twilight\\".)<br /><br />Should of gone with my hunch, many celebrities have read and loved this book and I dislike most viewpoints/lifestyles of celebrities. I'm also not into such fanfiction genre. The dialogue was raunchy but jumped around, was quick, vague, brief, and cut to the point. Didn't provide much background history or context in this volume. Where is the story? Shit, there never was one to begin with.<br /><br />I can see why people like this book, though. Many prior reviewers have complained about repetitive word usage and the majority of the story being made up of explicit sex scenes. The latter proves extremely fascinating. Plus, sex is something that everybody experiences in one way or another. The author hit the jackpot with this series because she touches amongst a large group of people. Without so many sex scenes, this book would just be boring and flat. It'd be like any romance novel out there today. The book keeps stringing you along, like a bad commercial incorporating a variety of things.<br /><br />I am in no way biased, I happen to know one couple who lives almost exactly like Ana and Chris. The two also happen to have the same five year age gap ina more open relationship. They chose the alternative of moving out with roommates. The Dude doesn't torture her or act all reckless like Chris does. The Dude knows that everything is built on lessons, time management, and consistency, not choppy!!! unbelievable!!! and excessively!!! extreme scenes. My family actually refers to this book and everything related to it as being THEIRS, which is ironic. Thankfully, they actually have boundaries, patience, and a lot of other more human characteristics that these two don't. The Dude has also done way more than Chris in this book and he prefers science fiction. Says he'll never read this, which is also what Rihanna chose to do.<br /><br />Even towards the end of \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\", I was left scratching my head. Honestly, I couldn't believe that was the ending. Read for yourself. I'm not a fan, however.<br /><br />Actually, I borrowed the books and I'm too glad that I didn't purchase them.
B005QUQP76|5.0|This mouse was made for FPS games. With its huge sniper button, head shots are much easier. This mouse seems to have been made for medium to large hands since the sniper button is a bit farther up. I had no issue with the mouse configuration software like other people seem to have.
B000MLQOI4|4.0|Sweet, unabashedly sentimental coming of age tale, set in a resort the Catskills mountains<br />- an area that was once the summer get away for upper-middle class Jewish families from<br />all over the New York area.<br /><br />The dancing is hot, the acting is a mix (Grey and Orbach are very good, Swayze tries hard,<br />looks great, but is a better dancer than actor ).<br /><br />The ending feels very Hollywood, which is too bad, because the film seemed to promise<br />more complexity in its gently satirical look at early 60s America in the first half.<br /><br />Plus some very creaky, cliche sub-plots start to invade the film as well.<br /><br />Yet the story is told with an honest and good heart, and there's a reason it's become<br />a mini-classic. Do I think it's a great movie? No. But can I understand why a<br />generation that grew up with it cherish it as a wonderful coming of age fantasy?<br />Absolutely.

B005HEQ6ZC|5.0|\\"Elementary, Dear Data\\" shines as the first truly great episode for Star Trek:TNG season 2. The story is well written with only a few suspensions of belief (outside the normal sci-fi-esque elements). The acting is quite good with Data and La Forge improving and starting to own their roles. The director allowed the story to unfold without resorting to gimmicks or the normal pitfalls which plagued season 1. The holodeck still has a freshness about it that intrigues the audience without feeling overdone. A great mixture of literature, suspense and science fiction for which Star Trek:TNG would become famous.

B002CAWNEM|5.0|It was a good movie we enjoyed  the movie. Thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks  and thanks
B003O86FMW|5.0|What can one say...the author does a great job continuing the saga.  I read the 2nd and 3rd books out of order, which is a no-no.  Should you do that, you will be completely lost, wondering how such a good FIRST book dwindles in quality by the following editions.  So, read the books in order.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|\\"And so it was decreed that each year, the various districts of Panem would offer up in tribute, one young man and woman to fight to the death in a pageant of honor, courage and sacrifice.\\" In the future the ruins of what was once North America the capital city of Panem stages a yearly contest known as the \\"Hunger Games\\". Two teenagers from each outlying district are forced to compete in a death match in order to keep the peace in the world. Katniss (Lawrence) volunteers in her sister's place and her mentor (Harrelson) soon thinks she could be the one to end the barbaric ritual. I have to admit that I did enjoy this movie but like most movies I saw it long after it came out and I don't think it lived up to the hype. I also have to say that a combination of that and having seen the movie \\"Battle Royale\\" first may have affected my opinion of the movie. This is very good and I am interested to see the other movies they are making but this is defiantly geared toward the young adult \\"Twilight\\" type crowd and after seeing \\"Battle Royale\\" this was just to tame for me. Don't misunderstand me though. I did like this and this is a good movie but for me it was only a one time watch. Overall, a series that I am looking forward to continuing but to me it didn't live up to the hype. I give it a B+.
0887431453|3.0|My daughter just turned 4 last month.  This book was exciting for her because of the bright pictures and quality; however, the content was WAY TOO EASY for her.  Simple line tracing and coloring... picking out which picture is different from the other two... She whipped through each page in moments.<br /><br />Good for self esteem I suppose.  I prefer the Brain Quest Pre-K workbook though... it's a bit more advanced.
1401235417|5.0|This is exactly what a Batman story should be. Tense, off-balance, action packed yet character driven.  Feeding off the shadows of Batman and Gotham's past to build intrigue this book works very well in establishing an enemy capable of doing harm, both physical and psychological to Batman.  The artwork is exceptional as well and does a great job of conveying the storyline.  In particular, Batman's break from reality is exquisitely rendered.  Overall, this is a great relaunch and well worth picking up.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Absoluty, irrevocably, and compleatly hooked on this book. Between the plots, the characters, and the awesomeness of the story is unbeleveable and will stand to be an all time clasic in years to come. I have to say one of my favorite thing about this book (when i say favorite i mean top 10) is Katniss, she is loyal, protective, and can fight for herself. I am not obsessed but I do love this book and the other two on ther series.

B008QE9VJI|5.0|For fans of the dark shadows tv show, seeing previews of the movie lead you to believe that Tim Burton made it into a silly comedy, so you thought it wouldn't be good. Well the previews of it are completely misleading, the movie is just as dark as the tv show was. And to those of you who were expecting this to be a comedy, but were bummed about how dark it was. Buy collections of the old tv show and see how dark it is and you will find out that Tim Burton did a very good job of this film. I was very impressed with how good this movie was. I loved it so much, that I bought collections of the tv show myself and now I'm addicted to it.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I was completely enthralled with this writer's prose and story-telling ability. Her descriptions are vivid and the interplay in the points of view are tricky but work to keep the reader engaged. The slow development of both characters' defects is suspenseful and kept me turning pages. However, I must agree with the other reviewers here about the ending. I am not sure how else it could have ended, but she created the story and the reader deserves better. I think it was almost a copout and after-thought. I don't know how they will ever make a good movie of this, but hey good luck.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|It was highly recommended to me by a colleague I met at a business meeting.  I had just finished another book so I downloaded Shantaram in the airport on the way home and began reading on the plane.  Within a day or so, I was so involved with this book that I would find myself at work thinking about going home so that I could continue reading it.  A colleague to whom I recommended it took it on vacation and said that she started waking up early so that she could continue reading where she left off the night before.  It has a great epic-quality story line, but what really got under my skin was the richest variety of the most interesting, complex and engaging characters I've encountered in any book that I can remember.  I couldn't help loving, hating, fearing and worrying about them even when I wasn't reading.  On top of all that, the story is painstaking wrought from prose that I would match up against any book on any best seller list.  I kept asking myself, who the hell is this person who wrote such a perfect book?
1401235166|3.0|I adore the Fables series. This volume (compilation) was as well written as the others--but it just didn't quite have enough story. It seemed to be setting up a couple of new story lines without having a separate story resolution. That having been said, I still enjoyed it and am looking forward to the next.

B00756GKBA|3.0|It's not on the same level as Confessions, Ray of Light, or even American Life, but the more I listen to MDNA, some songs grew on me. It doesn't fare much better than Hard Candy now that Hard Candy had grew on me. MDNA feels more like a<br />throwback with dance-party songs. Madonna seems more loose and humorous in which we haven't seen that side of her in a long time. I kinda felt disappointed at first in how the album sounded generic when she is usually one step ahead. Some songs take me back to Confessions and Ray of Light. Theme-wise, what I get from an album is a recently, divorced woman trying to move on with her life and having fun. Lyrically, the songs are a mix-match. Some are clever, some are humorous, and others are just cliche to the acquired taste. It's the ONLY album out this year that is WORTHY of my ears.<br /><br />1. Girl Gone Wild (4/5)-Guess you can say it's this generation \\"Girls<br />Just Want To Have Fun.<br /><br />2. Gang Bang (3/5)- it's very dark, unsubtle, and violent, but this is<br />Madonna's humorous side we have not seen in a long time. I wouldn't<br />suggest you sing this song in public,tho. People might think you're<br />pyscho..<br /><br />3. I'm Addicted (5/5)-awesome track<br /><br />4. Turn Up The Radio (4/5)- great song for the summer...a time to let<br />loose and release all the stress in your life.<br /><br />5. Give Me All Your Luvin (3/5)-got a catchy hook and chorus, but I<br />wouldn't consider it her strongest lead single.<br /><br />6. Some Girls (5/5)-Didn't like it at first, but now I'm in LOVE with<br />this song!!! i constantly have this on repeat. One of the BEST on the<br />album.

0061969656|4.0|As for seller, great! Arrived ahead of time and book came in great condition. As for book itself, I give the book a review of 4 stars because it looks terrible, brand new but terrible. I'm not sure if it's on recycled paper or what, but all the pages look uneven and roughly cut when book is closed...if this is the direction books are headed, it's no wonder e-books are gaining popularity.
B007SGM084|5.0|I starting reading this book and could not put it down! Seductive but not sleazy! I laughed and cried throughout each chapter!
0143121006|3.0|This book was not as good as I thought it would be. I agree with the reviewer who said it was hard to get through. Extremely repetitive. Yes, I will repeat that, very repetitive!  Nothing is resolved at the end. Glad I checked it out from library instead of purchasing it.
B006R1T40I|4.0|After a seven-year hiatus, partly due to personal setbacks, Bonnie gets down to business and forms her own Redwing Records label. When she straps on her slide guitar, it boasts her loosest playing in fourteen years. She's learned a great deal along the way as her self-production skills on eight of these twelve tracks are precision sharp. The fine songwriter she is has relegated herself mostly to the sidelines, but it's understandable because it's as an interpreter in which she's more identified. Of the Al Anderson tunes, only \\"Not Cause I Wanted To\\" springs out of the banal. However, there are three outstanding tracks that showcase Bonnie's band. On \\"Used To Rule the World\\", Bonnie's voice and guitar are so souped up that she makes seventies funk sound like the latest rage. Her reggae remake of Gerry Rafferty's \\"Right Down the Line\\" is thoroughly reimagined, wholly making it her own. The gorgeous \\"Take My Love With You\\", written by three unknowns, is equally measured in its wistfulness and self-assuredness. The sound of these songs is particularly augmented by the fresh blood of Mike Finnegan's Hammond organ.<br /><br />But it's on three other tracks, all produced by Joe Henry with his simmering band, that most successfully incorporate Bonnie's longstanding marriage with blues-based music. Her smoky contralto delivers immense poignancy with the set closer, \\"God Only Knows\\", supported with nothing but understated piano/keyboard. Topping that are two perfected updates of two Bob Dylan songs, both initially from his 1997 classic \\"Time Out of Mind\\". I'm convinced these songs, with her voice tinged with chagrin, were really meant for her. Veteran session guitarist Bill Frisell shines accordingly. On \\"Million Miles\\", she sees through artifice and it signifies as surely as anything she's ever done. I'd include this with perennial favorites like \\"Love Has No Pride\\", \\"Everybody's Cryin' Mercy\\", \\"Angel From Montgomery\\" and \\"I Can't Make You Love Me\\".

B000FC0SIM|4.0|It's a great book that not only talks about writing and King's style, but also talks about his life and how he got to where he is now.  Its a fast read and offers a lot of great tips for writers - and readers alike.
145162445X|5.0|The book, overall, is a remarkable work and leads the reader along a wonderful intellectual trail. It begins with very easy reading then becomes a bit denser near the middle. I found myself going back and re-reading parts.<br /><br />There are a few annoying small issues. He refers to Newton and others of that era as \\"scientists\\" when they certainly were not nor was that word in use to describe natural philosophers before the early 1800s. He also falls into the \\"flat-earth\\" myth when he talks about Middle Age people thinking the earth is flat. In reality the \\"roundness\\" of the earth was known well back into antiquity and was never in serious doubt. He also, early in the book, talks about the \\"weight\\" of the universe, or of \\"weighing\\" all the stuff out there. He really means \\"mass\\" not \\"weight\\"<br /><br />These are trivial complaints - overall the book is remarkably lucid and the few diagrams are very well-chosen. I particularly like the fact that he brings in older material such as the Cepheid variables. It connects his work to older breakthroughs and provides intellectual comfort to old geezers such as I!<br /><br />I have just finished reading the book and will probably have to re-read it once more to connect the concepts.<br /><br />Omitting equations was a wise idea - especially since Krauss can present a verbal explanation of their meaning. It is not dumbed down, just presented non-mathematically.<br /><br />One of the second-order benefits of reading this book is that it gives a deep insight into how scientists work and think. What constitutes \\"proof\\" and how it is tested and the back-and-forth between theory and experiment and prediction. I have read some of the negative reviews and many seem to struggle with the way science is done; don't like it; don't want to believe or accept it, and therefore fault the book. It is not a quick evening's read. I have a background in physics and astronomy (a bit outdated) and had to carefully work my way through.<br /><br />It's exhilarating!
B0025VLEM0|5.0|The dvd arrived on time and in good shape.  Typical plastic shrink wrap that's a bugger to remove but that wasn't a big issue.<br />Great movie!
B000XR4OC0|5.0|This is my first pair of Tom's but won't be the last.  They feel like I'm wearing no shoes at all.<br /><br />My foot is pretty hard to fit because I wear a 7-1/2 AA.  It's just a hit and miss when I order a pair of shoes in a brand that I've never worn, but I read advice saying to size down on these shoes, so I did.  I ordered a 7B and they fit perfectly.  I think I'll wear them enough to see if the fabric stretches before I order another pair, though, in case I need a 6-1/2.<br /><br />The shoes are light as a feather.  We'll see how they hold up, but I plan to wear them everywhere.  They have an insert that reminds me of one I used to buy for high heels.  It has a small arch support that I didn't expect and should make the shoes more comfortable for long periods of walking.  You're reminded by printing on each interior sole that they give a new pair of shoes to a child in need for every pair purchased.  Nice.<br /><br />I bought Black in a 7B but love every style, color, pattern.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|easy to play, kind of spendy but its for the kids and they earn it by doing chores. sometimes freezes but that could be my Internet. Had a problem once buying acorns but Gameloft was quick to help. I like these games for the kiddos because they have to learn self control on spending, they can't always spend their whole allowance on one thing or they can save it for next week on a bigger prize.
B006JD48NM|5.0|This video was so good I only wish it was longer or they were coming out with a sequel. The documentary follows Senna from his days racing go cart to the last lap of his life.  The interviews included in the extras section are not to be missed.  This video helped heal the old wounds from my favorite sports hero's untimely death while still in his prime.  A must see for all Senna fans.
B004QL7K6G|1.0|Rented this movie this weekend.<br />Comedies are supposed to bring you up not slam you down face first like this one did for me.<br /><br />You do (or at least I did) get attached to some of these characters and can relate to them.<br />However, the cheating/open relationship part really blew the movie up in my face.<br /><br />They could have presented that scene any other way and it could have worked or even been funny but I just felt so gross watching that moment that I wanted to vomit.<br />Comedies are not supposed to make you do that....unless from laughing so hard, which I have before. (Not with this movie).<br /><br />The only saving grace were the bloopers at the end reminding that I was just watching a movie, it was real and actually had me laughing. Too bad the rest of the movie did not.<br /><br />I think this was supposed to be a comedy but I think it was anything but.<br />It was closer to a wild west movie or even a foreign film than it was to a comedy, that's how unfunny it was.<br /><br />I give it 2 thumbs down, I'd give more thumbs if I had any.

B0088RQ4X4|3.0|Edgar Rice Burroughs' fav uncle John Carter \\"dies\\"; uncle leaves estate to Edgar along with a \\"diary\\" of his adventures on Mars & the fun ensues.  I really enjoyed it and had a good time watching it  after a string of dull, lifeless flicks lately.  John Carter is a memorable good time.  Fortunately, I didn't have any preconceived notions about it one way or the other; I knew nothing whatsoever about it.  Apparently it was some kind of critical flop & cost something like 250 million to make.  I could care less about all of that.  I think John Carter will hold up over the years quite well.  Yes, it's a Disney flick, but it's not really for young kids.  There's a whole lot of kick-ass and killing going on, with several dashes of lighter gore thrown in.  I liked it because it had a reasonably good plot with some reasonably good acting and some good laughs thrown in as well.  Throw in Lynn Collins in some very nice skimpy outfits & you've got my vote. I really had no complaints with this movie.
034580404X|5.0|I could not put any of the three books down. It was so well written and the story kept me interested to the very end. I hated to read the last couple of pages to end this story. It had everything for me, Love, hot sexy scenes, drama, an raw emotion. It moved me , entertained me and I hope to find a good read like that again. I thank the author for developing this story.
B000IMKDPC|3.0|Entertaining enough, if sometimes a little dull. Acting is generally good.  It lacks real pazazz somehow. It's really a prep for sequels more than anything. I particularly enjoyed Jackman as Wolverine & Anna Paquin as Rogue.  Bruce Davison as Senator Kelly did a nice job as well.  I found the first part of the movie more interesting than the last half where all the fireworks take place. It won't knock your socks off or give you fond memories, but it will provide a nice piece of entertainment for an evening.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I received this book from Netgalley in return for an honest review. This book tells the story of Abby and Travis. Abby is running from a dark past so when she heads off to collage her best friend America to start fresh without her past chasing her. One night America drags Abby to a fight that her boyfriend's cousin is fighting in. Abby gets her first real look at Travis he's the exact kind of guy she's trying to avoid. However Travis is persistent, and doesn't give up trying to win her over. She doesn't want to be another notch in his belt since he's known for a sleep with them, and leave them type of guy.<br /><br />As they start to become friends the pair makes a bet on Travis's next fight. If he gets hit then he has to be abstinent for a month, if he doesn't get hit then Abby has to live with him for a month. Of course he doesn't get hit and Abby has to move in with Travis for a month because she never welches on a bet. Over the next month they develop into best friends and Travis learns to care of Abby something he's never done before. They each have their own drama that cause flare ups in the relationship, apart they are both dysfunctional but together they are functional and it's really sweet.<br /><br />This book had me a little unsure because I've been hearing a lot of mixed reviews so I was a little nervous. I was hooked by the first 10% I was in love with both Abby and Travis they are just so perfect together it's just they don't see it. I feel like the characters are so well written your right there alongside. This book is written feels more like real life then a story, and no one is perfect. I found that it felt real refreshing.<br /><br />As the book progressed I kept cheering to myself since my hubby didn't care for Abby and Travis to make it work. I had a hard time putting it down I found myself reading when I shouldn't have been reading but it's such a awesome story I had to know if it would end the way I wanted it too. I had some teary moments when drama happened and my heart went out to the pair. I just really loved the story.drama happened and my heart went out to the pair. I just really loved the story.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|The story of \\"the help\\" is so insipring. I personally liked the book better than the movie, but the movie was good. Everyone who has read the book should see the movie, too!
0345803485|1.0|...say the last 3/4 of the book or so.  The story line is ridiculous, but as this is erotic fantasy, that isn't so surprising. I mean, it's fantasy right?  More depressing is the character development, or lack thereof.  The people in this tale have the complexity of Chia Pets.  Their actions, words, and emotions are as unpredictable as railroad tracks, kind of like what a Norman Rockwell BDSM painting would look like.  As far as the writing itself, I will admit I have a bias against first person present tense narrative in novels.  It takes really, really skillful wordsmithing to keep it at all lively.  In this case, it's like an annoying ad jingle that you can't get out of your head, simply because it's aired too frequently.  Phrases that are kind of cute initially, \\"inner goddess\\", for example, end up having the effect of a dentist's drill once you hear them more than three or four times.  But the most annoying part of the whole experience for me was that I got suckered by the hype and ended up wasting a few valuable hours on this turkey.

0143119680|5.0|This book is wonderful! I found the description of the book to be interesting, but truthfully I bought this book after seeing it described as a cross between Harry Potter and Twilight. Luckily, it is so much better than that and that categorization serves this book an injustice. The book is filled with adventure, love, history, science, mystery, and so much more! It is almost like the author took all of my favorite books and rolled them into one! I found myself to be completely engaged in the story by the end of chapter two, after that there was no putting it down! I am now reading the second book and must say that it is very entertaining as well. I would rate A Discovery of Witches at 10 stars, unfortunately Amazon only goes as high as 5!
B0001Z52RU|5.0|This film was amazing in how it addresses the paradox of time travel.  I find the ending appropriate to the theme of the film, how love transcends space and time and is sometimes laced with sacrifice and iced with courage.  Ashton Kutcher surprised me and if you are a sci fi fan, you will \\"get\\" the nuances that some of the reviewers found troublesome.<br /><br />I saw it in the theater and on television this weekend and only then did I really grasp it. It bears watching at least twice.

B003JIPJRE|5.0|Wow. This movie is amazing. The mood is very dark, as a Batman movie should be. The story is great, but very, very mature. The first scene of the movie says it all, when (spoiler alert!) the Joker is beating up Robin with a crowbar while he is tied up on the floor. Yeah, this is not one that you should be seeing with your kids. But, it is still an amazing move and i recommend every Batman fan buy it.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|*****WARNING SOME SPOILERS******<br /><br />A summary of my reasons for giving this book 1 star<br /><br />I think the book is badly written because:<br />-It is highly repetitive in it's use of dialogue, phrases and scenes.<br />-The characters are underdeveloped and dim, they are boring, and I cannot invest in them either emotionally or intellectually. I don't necessarily have to like characters in a book, but if I am to be drawn into a 3 book series there needs to be a greater level of complexity if it is going to sustain my interest.<br />-It doesn't offer me anything new, except the urge to rant about how absurd I found this book<br />-The author frequently blurs the lines between control/BDSM and abuse and attempts to explain it away with what I believe are trite, sterotyped and inadequate explanations. Eg. Grey is into BDSM because he was abused as a child, BDSM is not neccessarily a symptom of abuse.<br /><br />Now about the characters:<br />- Ana's initial attraction and then her reason to stay with Grey is, in my belief, superficial and lacks the layers of emotion that comes with the type of complex relationship James is trying to achieve in her books.<br />- Ana's ego and self esteem are so fragile, I feel that I need to give her a cuddle and then send her off for some therapy, she is in no way emotionally secure enough to enter any relationship let alone one where BDSM plays a central role.<br />-Grey is a controlling male that I believe has not been drawn with any kind of emotional depth to make me care if he can be redeemed as an attractive love interest.<br />-Telling me that he is drop dead georgeous, has a lot of money and good in the sack just doesn't cut it! If James wants me to get me into bed with Grey, she has to give me a little more than that. What James has actually given me are a whole lot of reasons why I don't want to get into bed with him eg. his stalker behaviours, controlling nature and emotional baggage.<br /><br />So for these reasons and many others, this book has failed for me as: an interesting story, an erotica, a piece of writing, a level of enjoyment.<br /><br />It is also for these reasons that I cannot for the life of me understand the appeal of Christian Grey.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It was a real treat to read this book.<br /><br />The approach of this book is unique, engaging, and literally engrossing. The first part of wool actually had me starting to close the cover. However the reviews piqued my interest, so I owe a big thanks to everyone that took the time to review this book.<br /><br />It has been a long time since I delved down the sci-fi side of fiction. Hugh has reborn that genera for me, at least his works.<br /><br />This book feels like a Suspenseful Mystery set in a Sci-Fi post apoc like world. It does contain some action, but the real grabber is how the limited view points and knowledge keep you in the dark. It leaves you guessing for a good part of the book. As the mysteries unravel it evolves into an action orientated work.<br /><br />Hugh could very well be a rising giant in the world of fiction.I will be helping him out as I am working through all of his works.<br /><br />(EDIT : IMHO this is Hughs best work. I have finished silo1-8, and still love it. I rate this probably in the top tier of my preferences. There is a lot of good work out there, but this is one of those ORIGINAL works that is just fantastic)

B000NYT1M6|5.0|My son got this as a 3 yr bday gift and it was immediately his favorite gift by far. We also have a Bruder digger that is a favorite, it is a great brand. He is already pointing out things in the catalog that came with it that he wants next!<br />My only issue w/ it is that he had popped the doors off within the 1st hour. I was a little surprised they came off so easily. I kept putting them back on but he seems to like taking them off so I gave up.<br />One thing is that it is a pretty big truck if anyone is considering buying it for a little one (under 2). My 3 yr old is average size & can just pick it up & carry it around.
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|I have been looking for this CD since I heard the Ho Hey song. I will be honest, I had not heard of the Lumineers before this song. I was a fan from the first time Ho Hey was on my radio. It it a happy catchy tune. It made me feel like it's the theme song to most feel good moments you have with your friends. I am not disappointed at the rest of the songs on the CD. They all have a catchy pure sound and make me smile; Flower in Your Hair is my 2nd favorite so far! The songs get caught in your head for sure, but not in a bad \\"please get out\\" way!<br /><br />I'm looking forward to playing this CD over and over during short trips to work, home, etc. and long road trips. This is one I will encourage my friends to purchase as well. I'm very happy with this purchase!

B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I finally was able to replace the mental pictures of Oz and the characters from the famous 1938 Judy Garland movie. Every page had a new surprise for my 7 year old and me. We really liked the queen of the mice and the true backstory of the winged monkeys. Do yourself a great favor and read this with your (grand)children.  I am making this one of our frequent reads.
0307346617|1.0|Do not WASTE your hard earned money on this product. I thought it was a story form about a war against the zombies.<br />Instead it was in a journal form. No character development just here is what happened and when historical presentation.<br />I read the first 10 pages and realized my mistake and threw it away.<br /><br />Amazon does not allow ZERO stars so I had to give it a one-start. If I could enter ZERO I would.
B008ER9QLK|5.0|This is a supurb production in all respects.  I saw it several times in the movie theater with the original showing and the encores.  The more I saw it, the more I liked it.  The singing is fantastic with a stellar cast.  I like the production as well, even though it is a modernized version as compared to the MET's previous production.  The projections of the forest and Rhine were excellent as well as the other special effects.  The bonus of the additional video is a major plus for buying this full set.  Go out and buy it, you won't be disappointed.  Don't buy the trashy European versions of this music masterpiece.  Stick with the MET who has done outstanding productions this season, many now on DVD.
B007N85ZXY|5.0|This is a fine piece of work from Neil Young. It took me several times listening to it before i became such a fan. However, it captures so much so and the more you listen the more you appreciate this fine record.

B005LAIIQC|5.0|\\"The Bourne Legacy\\" is pretty good. This is how the story goes: To become an elite government operative, a man hands himself over to the same agency that birthed the likes of Jason Bourne, but he's eventually forced to go on the run.<br /><br />The cast led by Jeremy Renner (as Aaron Cross), Rachel Weisz (as Marta Shearing), Edward Norton (as Eric Byer), Stacey Keach (as Mark Turso), Albert Finney (as Albert Hirsch), Scott Glenn (as Ezra Kramer), David Strathairn (as Noah Vosen) & Joan Allen (as Pamela Lundy) is pretty good. The directing by Tony Gilroy is pretty good. The story by Gilroy & the screenplay by Gilroy & his brother, Dan, is pretty good, both based on the inspiration of the Bourne series by Robert Ludlum.<br /><br />The music by James Newton Howard is pretty good. The cinematography by Robert Elswit is pretty good. The film editing by John Gilroy is pretty good. The casting by Ellen Chenoweth is pretty good. The production design by Kevin Thompson is pretty good. The art direction by Charlie Campbell, Molly Hughes, Joan Winters & Hinju Kim is pretty good. The set decoration by Paul Healy, Christine Moosher, Lisa Scoppa & Leslie E. Rollins, set dressings by Sean Doyle, Jeni Harden & Marisa Umsawasdi & set designs by Deborah Jensen is pretty good. The costume design by Shay Cunliffe is pretty good. The stunts coordinated by Dan Bradley & Chris O'Hara & fights coordinated by Jonathan Eusebio, Jon Valera & Allen Jo is pretty good. The special effects supervised by Garry Elmendorf & Alan Scott, coordinated by Stan Blackwell, Garry Cooper, Steven Kirshoff, Lindsay MacGowan, Shane Mahan & John Rosengrant is pretty good. The visual effects supervised by John Bair, Hal Couzens, Michael Bruce Ellis, Jeremy Hattingh, John Heller & Will Telford, coordinated by Katie Bell, Cynthia Angel, Judith Gericke, Olivia Goh, Erin Eunsung Kim, Harrison Marks, Katy Mummery & Dennis Murillo is pretty good.<br /><br />This is a great sequel / reboot that is just as effective as its predecessors were. This is also a great continuation of the Bourne series, albeit without Bourne himself in it. Jeremy Renner does an effectively great job, replacing Matt Damon, as the character of Aaron Cross. Tony Gilroy also does an effectively job, taking over the reins of director from both Doug Liman & Paul Greengrass, and also continuing the writing of the story & screenplay to the Bourne series, as well. This is also a great action film that keeps you thinking and entertained, at the same time, as well. This is also another great film to have in the dog days of summer, as well.
1594744769|4.0|Warning: Spoilers.  I liked the book, found it to be engrossing and well-written, but didn't appreciate the \\"non-ending,\\" which certainly leaves plenty of room for a sequel.  I would much rather have had an actual ending, tying up the loose ends.  Speaking of loose ends, does it say anywhere in the book what happened to Victor?  As in, what killed him and how?  If he was killed by one of the hollows or wights or whatever, how did it get into the loop, or was Victor out of the loop when it happened or was it during Grampa's time on the island or what?  Or what!? The Victor thing really bugged me.

B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I think Robert Downey Jr. is so awesome in these movies. I bought this for my dad for Father's Day. Normally I purchase only Blu Ray but he's a little behind on the tech so I got him the normal DVD. We love this movie :)

B004W2UBYW|3.0|Although this book is a good read - and I can relate to a lot of the technical development chronology in the book - I was deeply disappointed by the personal aspects of the man Steve Jobs, and that a company founded/headed by a person using his management tactics would be so hugely financially prosperous.
0307592731|2.0|I'd heard so much about this book and really wanted to like it but it did not live up to all the hype. I tired of its repetitiveness, was disappointed with its sugar-sweet ending and failed to see how the journey transformed the author.<br /><br />I lost trust in the author at some point during her story and simply stopped believing what she was saying. I kept thinking I'd shake the feeling and be drawn back into her journey. But it never happened. Instead, at every juncture in her path I found myself sighing and shaking my head at yet another incredible turn of events.<br /><br />I've read many of the positive reviews in hopes of discovering what all the fuss is about regarding this book. There are some well-crafted lines in her prose but beyond that I'm at a loss. Gotta hand it to her marketing team, though!!
0553801473|3.0|Oh!  I've had the ups and downs with this series.  The first book, while interesting, drew me in enough that I had to continue but did not excite  me wholly.  That was the job of the second book, and the third.  But now, with the fourth and fifth books, I find myself underwhelmed by the series and where it is going.  I should caution, if you haven't read the first book (and all the others after it) this review is not going to be helpful to you at the least.  It is best to start at the beginning.<br /><br />There are many many plots and stories in this series.  So much that it is hard to describe them with the detail that they deserve.  But there are some large ones.  Like the plight of Daenerys Targaryen and her dragons, who only wants to reclaim the kingdom for herself.  Tyrion Lannister, who has been outlawed and must use his cleverness for not only saving his skin but furthering his agendas.  King Stannis, also trying for a throne that he thinks is rightfully his, and the burning god that he claims to follow.  And several others, which, like in all the books, only want to play the game of thrones and win.<br /><br />Don't get attached to the characters.  That is the most important lesson that Martin gives us.  You never know just  how long they'll be with us and it does no good to retain a favorite, although sometimes it can't be helped.  I find the dwarf, Tyrion Lannister, most intriguing and I know that I'm not alone in that sentiment.  He is so complex and (I believe) a good character that I find myself rooting for him quite often, even when he does something that I don't agree with.  Arya Stark is a character that I didn't like in the beginning, but her role in the books has become so intriguing that I look forward to her stories and what she goes through.  For a little girl, she is quite brave and devious.  And my undisputed favorite would be Daenerys.  She acts the true queen but still has enough innocence that she is quite likable.  And she's the character I identify with most (although I am very much aware that I don't possess dragons nor am I a queen).  She is just that inspiring for a book character.<br /><br />As said before the plot is very twisted and there are many many characters.  As such, it can get very hard to follow and there are some chapters that I find myself drifting away from the book and not really caring about the characters featured.  Not to mention that while this book had most of my favorite character's stories, it didn't have them all.  It also went back in the timeline to the previous book and that was a tad confusing as well.  I prefer it when things happen in a continuous timeline rather than bouncing back and forth.  While there are some interesting aspects to this book, most of it is a lot of talking and planning and quite frankly, boring.  I like intrigue well enough, but when that's all there is it sometimes makes you wish the book would just hurry up and get somewhere.<br /><br />I still like the series even if I think it's gotten weaker in the past two books.  There's so much detail here that rereading the series over and over I'm sure there would be something new found every time.  I look forward to when the next book comes out.<br /><br />A Dance with Dragons<br />Copyright 2011<br />1016 pages<br /><br />Review by M.

Nothing new here about the topic of success.<br /><br />I read this book while being stuck at home with a fractured foot. It helped me pass the time.
030746363X|5.0|I always love Tim's writing cause he seems to think very similar to myself and leaves out all the boring stuff. This book is straight to the point and never boring to read no matter which chapter you are on.<br /><br />I have tried many of the methods in his book for exercising and it all holds true. I incorporated bits and pieces of his routines into my schedule to suit me. A must have for any life hack person that wants to be healthy and not have to spend 10hrs a week in the gym but get great results.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|Got this when it was the FAotD and I use it all the time. I love the way you can put folders \\"within\\" folders, and give your folders icons. But what happened to the contacts? Long pressing a contact used to give you the option of contact method (call, text, etc.).  Now it just gives you the option to change the label, view the default android contact info, or share. Huh? What's with that? It's a huge step backward in functionality! Ended up purchasing Animated Widget Pro to give me back that feature. I still use FO for organizing apps, just not for contacts. Using HTC One X.<br /><br />Update: Oops, my bad. Found the \\"quick contact\\" feature in settings. It was all the way at the bottom. Must have missed it. So, now I'm happy :) 10 stars for FolderOrganizer!!! That other app I purchased - history.
0385512058|5.0|You can read about these concepts in different and I'm sure many other places, but the way Keith presents it was very inspirational and motivating to me. It makes my top 5 of all time books for me and I read it very quickly which is a feat considering my very short attention span for most things.<br /><br />If you want to be more successful at anything in life you have to buy this book... if you are reading this review it means you must be interested in the topic so I'm going to say you MUST BUY THIS BOOK RIGHT NOW! DO IT!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I used to have several of these, they were lost during a move and when I saw this one, it is the best of all worlds for having a quick sharp knife.  It has the carbide, the ceramic, and a diamond if you want to shave.  The carbide will do most sharpening jobs, but the ceramic and diamond are for those of us who want a really sharp knife.  I am impressed with this little gadget.  Just what I needed to feel at home in a new place. fredt
159562015X|5.0|If you are interested in what makes you tick and what type of things keep you interested that this book comes highly suggested.<br /><br />If you are into myers briggs or other personality tests I would highly suggest you buying this book. It almost takes the opposite stance of the myers briggs as it suggests you focus on working on your strenghts in all aspects of you life as opposed to spending time improving your weaknesses.<br /><br />I have implemented this concept since reading with great success. I find that I am much more engaged and productive now focusing on my top 5 strengths.

I read every single page of this book and loved it.<br /><br />There are great explanations about every type of exercise you could ever need if you want to get big. I no longer want to be a big meat head and switched to quick compound workouts. I used to be around 205lbs with 8% body fat. I am no Arnold but this book definitely helped me target specific muscles I wanted to grow and how to do it.

B001F7MSG6|4.0|Hellboy II: The Golden Army is the second entry in the movie adaptations of the cult classic Dark Horse graphic novel arc. It's also a solid reminder of the beautiful mind that director/scribe Guillermo del Tor has. Honestly, I've never been a fan of the comics or the director, but the Hellboy films do a very good job of making you a fan of his. They perfectly compliment his directing style, and artistic preferences. These are some of the best Fantasy films you're going to find out there, and some of the best looking Blu-ray presentations to boot. The cinematography is just gorgeous throughout the entire film. There is a perfect blend of colors, surrounded in darkness that really excites the eyes and sucks you into this magical world. In this magical world live some of the most intriguing creatures that I have ever seen on film. I would even go as far as to say that the creatures in the Hellboy movies are the most original and interesting that I have seen since the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings trilogies. And that says a lot, in fact, much more than \\"a lot\\" in the day and age where nothing original is being produced.<br /><br />Adding to the artistic brilliance of the film is the score. The music flows perfectly in sync with the story and characters' emotion on screen. Danny Elfman adds another to his list of noteworthy comic book movie scores. The most notible remains Spider-man in my book (even better than Batman). The acting is very good as well. Is there any other role that Ron Perlman was born to play besides this comedic, yet conflicted tough guy? He was really good in the first Hellboy, but in this one he looks so comfortable in the make-up, as if it is his own skin. My favorite character from the first was the assassin, Kroenen. With him dead and gone, Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) fills that void. He provides laughs, without coming off as a corny joke. Which could have easily happened if the actor was not up for the task of making that character respectable. Besides those two characters, there are other great performances as well. Most notibly, Luke Goss as the evil elf prince, Nuada. I love it when directors allow actors who are real martial artists to play characters that are also martial artists. I also liked (and hated) Jeffrey Tambor as Tom Manning. Even I wanted to punch that guy. Selam Blair was not bad at all, but she did not impress me either. Who did impress me was whoever played Johann Krauss. I believe his voice was done by the family guy himself, mister Seth Macfarlane. Now that all of that is out of the way, let's get to what really matters in every summer superhero blockbuster, the action!<br /><br />It is simply amazing. The stuntwork is on par with that of my personal favorite martial artist/actor Ray Park (Snake Eyes/Darth Maul). All of the combat is well choreographed, and the visual effects are even better. All I can say is that I am extremely anxious to see what Guillermo del Toro does with The Hobbit. Peter Jackson can step aside and be assured that his franchise in in very good hands. On a completely different side note, I want to point out the great little Universal easter eggs. I went to Universal Studios today so it's fresh on my mind. I noticed (but their not really hidden) a few quick cameos of a few of the original Universal monsters (The Wolfman, Frankenstein and The Creature of the Black Lagoon) on various television screens throughout the movie. That probally doesn't matter to anyone else, but I thought it was pretty cool. All there is to say about the audio and video on this disc is that they're perfectly captured to deliver one of the best transfers I've ever seen. And to my shock, the extras are as thorough as an anniversary edition that one would expect to see decades down the road. Overall, I obviously love this movie. And even if you aren't as enthusiastic about it as I am, no one can deny the quality of this package.sides those two characters, there are other great performances as well.

B001DJLCRC|1.0|We were disappointed to find out that this series includes a lot more nudity and bad language than when shown on TV.
B001DSNF8C|5.0|I imagine something along these lines happened in a nice boardroom in one of the office buildings on the Sony Pictures studio lot: It's June 2002, and audiences across the nation are being swept off their feet by a deadly government assassin with a serious case of the forgetfuls. There's a deadly agent that people are falling in love with, who has \\"J.B.\\" as his initials, and it ain't James Bond. I imagine that didn't sit well with those suits in that boardroom, and it promptly urged them to begin their search for the next British actor to don the classic black tux and shaken, not stirred, martini. Fast-forward four years, to 2006, and we arrive at Casino Royale. After saying all of that, I still have to admit that Casino Royale is one hell of a remarkable film. Daniel Craig is exactly what I feel James Bond should be. It's funny that not many people had faith in him, until they saw the movie for themselves. I really wanted to see an actor put a new twist on the character, rather than copying the tried and true smooth-talking 'Bond, James Bond' from the older movies. I have to say, Daniel Craig did not disappoint me in the slightest. He radiates cool, and badassery, while managing to eliminate the main thing that I had problem with in older 007's. The over-the-top gadgets were the only thing that prevented me from loving earlier Bond films, as silly as that may sound. I just could never take them seriously in the contexts of the films.<br /><br />For instance, the car that could become invisible and the surf boards with weapon compartments in Die Another Day, and the wheelchair with a missle as a leg cast in GoldenEye, just to name a couple. I'm not very familiar with the oldest Bond movies, but I'm pretty sure they had even whackier gadgets than that. Anyway, the closer to realism, the better, in my opinion. At least for this particular property. I would not say that philosophy translates to every rebooted franchise out there, but I certainly think that mentality has worked wonders for this one. I thoroughly enjoyed the action sequences in Casino Royale, as well. They were very extreme, yet remained so believable. One of my favorite movie scenes of all time is the scene when Bond parkour chases the bomb maker in Madagascar. That scene was so mind-numbingly awesome that I immediately realized that something special was in out midst. Ironically, action is not this film's only strong point. I also love the tension, especially in the poker scenes. To this day, those moments make my heart rate increase slightly. No spoiler intended, but in one scene Bond's heart rate gets a bit of a boost as well. To further adress my inference that the Bourne series was an inspiration for this one to be rebooted the way it was, I want to add that I never got a Bourne vibe from this film. This movie more than stands on its own two feet, and did not copy Bourne in any way. I just credit the Bourne series for inspiring the producers and filmmakers to revamp this franchise the way they did.<br /><br />I so love the way this movie came from basically nowhere, to pretty much blew the minds of fans around the world. It reminds me of what Wb, Christopher Nolan, and Batman Begins did for the Batman franchise. All I can say is, thank God for Jason Bourne. If Bourne had not come along and set a new bar for secret agent/government assassin action thrillers, I seriously doubt that 007 would have been rebooted with such a vengence. And boy was it. Casino Royale actually surpasses all of its predecessors (at least the ones I have actually seen) and the Bourne series. In my humble opinion, it's a near perfect masterpiece. And the gorgeous Blu-ray transfer is nothing short of amazing as well. Reference quality audio and video. This Collectors Edition adds a plethora of special features for fans to dig into, greatly boosting the quality of the set as a whole. Highly Recommended!s worked wonders for this one.

B000AP04OM|5.0|I purchased this DVD at the request of my 10 year old granddaughter. Her 5th grade chorus had sung some songs from it, but she had never seen the movie or heard all the songs. The ones she sang made her curious about the rest. It's as much a \\"visit from the past\\" for me as it is a new experience for her. In a high school concert I sang \\"These Are a Few of My Favorite Things\\" (and even wore a white dress with a blue satin sash!) The clarity of both video and audio is very good. The colors are true to the original (as I remember it!) I think this will become a family favorite. It's a pleasure to be able to have an opportunity to own a copy of such an \\"old\\" movie.
B00371QQ8Y|5.0|Traffic is a excellent film. Pretty much perfect all around performances by an all-star cast lead by, Don Cheadle, Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Benicio Del Toro, Topher Grace, and Erika Christensen, to name a few. It also has a top notch script and a completely necessary story. Drug trafficking is a plague on the American/Mexican border, and being an Angelino, more specifically on the Southern California/Mexico border. Too many lives have been lost, and it still goes on today without an end in sight. That makes this film just as relevant today, as it was a decade ago, and will be a decade later, unless major moves are made. Director Steven Soderbergh (Oceans Trilogy, Erin Brockavich, The Informant!, and so many other great films) has crafted a near masterpiece. There are some things I wasn't too fond of. Perhaps at times, Soderbergh's tendancy to oversaturate the picture with yellow or blue color grading became more of a gimmick. And with a less than perfect trasnfer, one may start to look at other minor gripes with more emphasis. But for the most part, it was fine. This film is a must see, but definitely go for the Criterion release with a better transfer and much more well-rounded extras package.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is super fun! my kids and I played it almost nonstop. similar idea to tetris. lots of levels too!
B001EIOOWC|4.0|Eastern Promises is undoubtedly a fantastic film. It felt to me like a Russian Goodfellas, or Godfather in essence, of course without the scale and grandiose of those classic mafia films. Maybe it could have been if there were more time devoted to the Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen), and not more than half of the movie devoted to the prostitute Tatiana and her daughter. I understand that's what the story was about, and I'm basically complaining about the main plot of the story, but I loved Nikolai's character so much that I wanted to see much more of him. That truly is more of a testiment to Mortensen's performance than it is a criticism of the film. If there were a little more depth to the story (it's only an hour and a half), I wouldn't mind it so much. I just felt like every time I would get sucked into Nikolai's world, the baby subplot pulled me out a little more than I would have liked. I will say though, I really liked how the story came full circle and connected the multiple dots in a very interesting way.<br /><br />This is, like I said, a fantastic film. It has possibly the tensest fight scene that I have ever seen. Major respect goes to Viggo for doing it fully nude. I'm sure thousands of Lord of the Rings chicks lost their marbles after that one. That scene is superb enough for me to recommend this movie to everyone. But as a part of your collection, I am not sure it's for everyone. I enjoy it enough to own it, but I recommend it as a rental first for each to decide for themselves. The transfer iv quite qell done. It's one of Universal's better efforts.
B005OHSUQK|5.0|Season four doesn't pull punches as it further dives into the Hamlet mythos with Jax and Tara looking for a way out of the biker lifestyle. The attention to detail helps to elevate this series above much of the rest of standard fare crime drama. I still can't believe this isn't on HBO, it's just that good.
B007L4HFDI|5.0|Following the cult classic status of Blade and the surprising box office success of X-Men, Marvel decided to lend out the rights of another one of their most cherished characters. Based on the success of the cartoons, this was sure to pull in a very specific demographic, but I doubt they expected it to be as popular as it became. It surpassed the success of X-Men, and ushered in a decade that would have many more comic book, cartoon, and toy movies set records. For too many years, these types of properties did not get the respect they deserved as real dramatic and action movies, and not just dumb superhero fun. Spider-Man finally got that due respect. The weekend it came out, my focus was on Star Wars Episode II, but after I saw Spider-Man I was blown away. Like many others of my generation, my fandome really started with the first Spidey film, and then blossomed into collecting stacks upon stacks of comics. The visual effects were not the standard for the time, especially with the aforementioned Star Wars film coming out, but they were still pretty damn good. The music was fantastic, thanks to Danny Elfman (the man behind The Simpsons music, and so many other great film scores). Director Sam Raimi created a truly stylistic and visual masterpiece. Honestly, I'm not a fan of the Evil Dead series. I doubted a director best known for horror movies would do the material justice, but he did not disappoint.<br /><br />Neither did the cast. All of the actors were fairly new to me. I had no idea who most of them were, except Kirsten Dunst I knew from Small Soldiers (I was a child). But I always applaud and appreciate big blockbusters that turn lesser names into household names. Tobey maguire and Dunst had a chemistry that really dold the complex relationship of the two iconic characters they were portraying. To this day, my favorite character, besides Spider-Man, is definitely JK Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson. If ever there were an actor born to play a specific supporting role, it was him. Willem Dafoe was great as Norman Osborn. As the serum changed him from a desperate businessman to a conflicted monster, the not so subtle nuances of Dafoe's performance really began to shine through. If only Green Goblin's costume had less of a silly looking design, then his character would be one of the premier villains in Marvel film history. As it stands, Goblin's costume only hurts the film by making it seem more campy than it really is. It serves as a constant reminder that you're watching a cartoon with real people acting it out. Nevertheless, Spider-Man should definitely be creditted as the film that sparked the hype and interest that comic book adaptations get today. If it were not for Spider-Man (as well as Blade and X-Men), I doubt that movies like Watchmen, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Fantastic 4, Ghost Rider, Punisher, Dare Devil, or any of the other countless comic book and superhero flicks would have been taken seriously enough to be converted from script into film.<br /><br />And the Blu-ray presentation of this old favorite of mine was night and day upon my discovery of the disc. I had seen the DVDs countless times, but it wasn't until my eyes were laid upon the BD that I appreciated every inch of every frame as they were shot. Detail is remarkable. Color is rich. It truly is like watching the movie for the very first time. Now this re-release features extras that the first release lacked. It has pretty much all the essentials, and leaves behind some of the more fluff extras from the DVDs. Highly Recommended!e, it was him. Willem Dafoe was great as Norman Osborn.

B003ELMR9E|4.0|Insomnia is a bit different from what Christopher Nolan is known for, but it's still another fantastic notch on his belt. I stated in my review of The Prestige that, that movie was possibly his weakest, and I felt that way until revisiting this film. I think Insomnia is his weakest entry overall, but it was still a fantastic thriller. Calling any of Nolan's film weaker than their counterparts doesn't quite mean the same as it would for many other filmmakers, because I like all of his films that I've seen. First of all, the pacing is surprisingly well done. His films tend to run two hours plus, but this one was just under two hours. That was great because it had a quicker pace that captured the feeling of trying to solve a murder case in the first few days (any First 48 fans out there?). This movie was a remake apparently, I wasn't aware of that until doing some research. It's a remake of a 1997 Erik Skjoldbjærg movie by the same name. I cannot judge whether or not it does the original justice, but I can say that it is worth a watch.<br /><br />Al Pacino did a great, if not subdued, job as a conflicted veteran LAPD officer who recently came under scrutiny for some questionable acts he and his partner committed while on the job. What's new, it's the LAPD? Opposite of Pacino was Robin Williams as a creepy local novelist, and my was he great. Between this and One Hour Photo, I've seen a sinister side of Williams that I'd love to see more, and more of in the future. Hilary Swank rounds out the leads as an unexperienced, and eager, local officer assisting Pacino's character, Dormer, on this investigation. She's always reliable, and hardly ever outshines her co-stars. Same goes for her in this film. Aside from the effective leads, another aid to this film in setting the tone of a classic suspense novel or film was the snowy, cold, lonely Alaskan setting. Alaska, when used correctly, can be an amazingly chilling (no pun intended) setting for any bleak, mysterious, etc story. Insomnia is not as dark as what one would have grown accustomed to by Nolan's standards (literally because the sun never sets in Alaska), but because of the somber tone, it's still a dark story.<br /><br />The story is also pretty complex. It's not difficult to follow by any means, but the way that events unfold increasingly complicate things for our lead character, until that faithful day in all suspense thrillers where things come to a head and then pop, like a figurative pimple. It was really interesting to see Pacino's character progress through one distressing situation after another, all while battling his own demons from his past. Again though, the actors are what really drive this thriller home. Not to beat a dead horse, but Robin Williams is quite disturbing, and Hilary Swank also did quite well. The music did not stand out as much as the scores in Nolan's films usually do. This was before Nolan and Zimmer hooked up, so that's understandable. Overall, I liked it a lot. It hasn't become a classic in its genre, but it's still a great crime story and case study. It's smartly crafted, and definitely worth everyone's time.y.

B005MYEQ4U|2.0|I couldn't imagine that Woody Allen is capable of producing such a piece of junk. The film is supposed to be a nostalgic tribute to the 20's and 30's of Paris of the XX century with it's famous artists, writers and film makers,but actually it is about nothing.The acting is terrible, especially by a silly and totally unfunny clown Owen Wilson.All the characters are like cartoon pictures.Carla Bruni as a museum guide is just an anecdote (was there not any proper actress who could act this role?).And what is the story about? For what purpose are there so many art celebs from the last century gathered? A very poor effort, Woody.
B001KZVQJI|5.0|The story of King Kong is a classic piece of American Cinema. Peter Jackson has stated in the past that he grew up with a deep-seated love and adoration of the original King Kong from the early 1930's. So who better to direct a massive 3 hour plus story about a massive ape, than the man who made me fall in love with Middle Earth? Yes, Peter Jackson was probally one of the best things about this film. He may make very long movies, but at least they are also very entertaining and engrossing movies. King Kong does tend to run on quite a bit, due to possibly unnecesary scenes, like giant bugs for example, and the Extended Edition adds on even more. I can't say for sure that they were unnecesary, because they may have been in the original films. Then I would just sound stupid for calling them \\"unnecesary\\". Thank God they had the presence of mind to reserve some stuff for an extended edition though. Even with the footage some might call \\"unnecesary\\", I still found very much to appreciate in the story. I know the first thing alot of people say is, \\"CGI takes away from a good story\\", but definitely not this one.<br /><br />It was fresh and exciting for me to see Kong done so realistically, with modern technology (before it took over Hollywood). Kong himself, is so realistic, I had a hard time getting over how beautifully he was created. Everything from a wound he got in battle, to wet fur was gorgeous. It was an especially nice touch when he would breath on Ann, and her hair would blow in the air current. I also have to say that I was pleasantly surprised to see Jack Black in a more serious role. Some may disagree with me, but I think he did a fine job. As did both Naomi Watts, and Adrian Brody. None of the actors are more intriguing than Kong though. So while King Kong is far from a perfect film, I believe Peter Jackson and his team did a fantastic job of bringing this classic to a modern audience. Many people think that classics should never be remade, but I say if the movies are really that good, filmmakers should reintroduce them to younger generations with a modern look.<br /><br />What more is there to say about this flawless transfer that hasn't already been said a thouand time over? It truly is one of the pinnacles of the media format, and would (did) serves as a terrific reference disc. As a general rule of thumb, I automatically bump my extras rating up to a 3/5 if there is a commentary on the disc. That happens to be the only thing of real value on this disc, aside from the film iteself obviously. So I'll definitely be holding onto my 3-Disc DVD set. All in all though, I Highly Recommend this one!vies are really that good, filmmakers should reintroduce them to younger generations with a modern look.<br /><br />What more is there to say about this flawless transfer that hasn't already been said a thouand time over?

B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Wanted to upgrade my wife's computer.  The I5-3570K with a Z77 motherboard gave WEI's of 7.6, 7.8, 6.5, 6.5 & 6.0 without overclocking.  For non-gameing the two graphic values of 6.5 seem great.  Did an Intel Rapid Storage Technology cache with a SSD so it boots in about 45 to 50 seconds.  Think a larger SSD used as the boot drive would have been a better investment.  Without a graphics card her system runs cool & quiet.<br />  If overclocking, highly suggest a heatsink/fan assembly better than Intel's.
B000Q67876|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest films that I have ever seen. It may well be the best period. For quite a while it has ranked at #1 on the internet movie database, and with good reason. Not often does a film seamlessly blend gripping dramatic storytelling, with moments of lighthearted humor, as well as moments of deep sadness like this one does. I'm sure that just about everyone has seen this film, but I'll still run through the main plot really quick. An intelligent banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) discovered that his wife was stepping out on him with another man. After a night of drinking, and misguided decisions, he ended up in front of a judge and jury for their murders. In prison for life, he befriended a guy named Red (Morgan Freeman), and eventually the Warden (Bob Gunton). And the journey goes on from there. There are so many great things for me to address, but my favorite is the acting. The entire cast was perfect. Tim Robbins gave probably the best performance of his entire career. At first his character appeared quiet and timid, but after while he seemed to loosen up, and grew as a person from then on. Character development does not get any better than this. He also grew on me, and I felt like I was on the journey with him. Because of how great Robbins was at being secretive, I could not tell if his character was really innocent, or guilty. He also could not have done better at portraying Dufresne's deceptive intelligence. Andy Dufresne was definitely the whole package, and so was Robbins.<br /><br />When an actor gives such a powerful performance, there usually are not any other actors that stand out in the film, but The Shawshank Redemption is exceptional in many ways, including this one. Beside Tim Robbins's, there are a few more perfect performances. There could not have been a better choice for the supporting role than Morgan Freeman as Ellis Redding, or 'Red'. I was really convinced that he was a veteran inmate. His specialty was smuggling in things that his fellow inmates requested. Usually for cash, but cartons of cigarettes seemed just as important as cash in Shawshank Prison. I enjoyed watching Red grow throughout the story, right alongside Andy. In the beginning, Red was as guilty as they come. He knew what he did was terrible, and regretted it, but he didn't know how to convey that sorrow to the parole committee. Honestly, I'm not even sure if he was regretful for his crime, or the fact that he was in prison for life. Every ten years when he got his chance to face the committee, he was rejected because he wasn't confident enough with himself to prove that he was ready to be a member of society again. But he grew as a character and finally proved worthy, simply by admitting that he was young and stupid, and there's nothing he can do to change what he did.<br /><br />Bob Gunton was great as Warden Norton. He wasn't brutal and violent like his head guard Captain Hadley, but he still as sinister as your typical movie villain can be (without being one note and cheesy). He definitely earns his place on my \\"Favorite Movie Villains\\" list. Speaking of Captain Hadley, Clancy Brown's performance as the prison guard who enjoyed his authority way too much was quite memorable. Not often in film, does the secondary antagonist stand out as much as the primary. But like I said, The Shawshank Redemption is exceptional in many ways. Captain Hadley is right on par with Warden Norton, in my opinion. I cannot give so much attention to the characters without mentioning one of my favorites, Brooks. James Whitmore gave a solid performance as an inmate spent nearly fifty years of his life in Shawshank Prison. He appeared to be just a poor sweet old man that walked around with a bird in his pocket, but we later saw how institutionalized his time behind bars made him. It was really sad, and one of the most effective parts on the story. But enough of the actors. I always pay attention to the music in films. Sowith that said, I have to mention the wonderful score done by the legendary composer Thomas Newman. He has composed some beautiful scores for big films like WALL-E, American Beauty, Finding Nemo, The Green Mile, Road to Perdition and Jarhead. But the music he did for The Shawshank Redemption ranks among his best, in my opinion.<br /><br />I don't know what else to say about this wonderful film, besides how beautiful it is. I cannot think of anything at all to complain about. It's one of my favorite films because it never gets dull, and it never gets old. It's a film that needs to be watched, and rewatched. Director Frank Darabont has not done many films, but I doubt he will ever be able to top this one anyway. The Shawshank Redemption is a classic that should not be missed by anyone. And the Blu-ray presentation should not be missed by anyone either. This is a gorgeous looking transfer. A beautiful transfer for a beautiful film.

B001GCUO5W|4.0|Alot of people (both critics and moviegoers) were calling Shutter a middling, mediocre film when it first hit theaters. I guess when you compare it to Martin Scorsese's classic films, which have become some of the best ever made, it may seem that way. In my opinion, this is a damn fine movie. It does start off kind of slow, only at times. I have to say, I was pretty disappointed at how short Jackie Earle Haley's role was, considering he was one of the draws for me. I thought he would have a little more time at least, but he only had a brief cameo. That doesn't really matter because Leonardo DiCaprio completely owned this one. He was just fantastic. I've never gushed over any of his performances before (even though The Departed is one of my all-time favorite films), but there is absolutely no denying his talent in this one. His character covered every emotion that I can think of, and DiCaprio did a fine job at keeping us along for the ride. Actually, to be fair, the entire cast was perfect.<br /><br />Everyone from Ben Kingsley, to Mark Ruffalo. They all give convincing performances. There really is no reason for me to even talk about the acting. It was simply perfect. As for the screenplay. It was gripping. I don't read many books (except for graphic novels), but this movie made me seriously consider picking up the novel. Now I've read a few reviews for this movie, and complaints about the music being intrusive came up a couple times. Some people said that it was distracting at times. Well, I tried very hard to hear what they were talking about, but I didn't. I do have a couple of complaints though. I actually have the exact same complaint about this film, that I had about The Bad Lieutenant. Personally, I like it when nightmare and hallucination scenes appear real, but in Bad Lieutenant, and some of them in Shutter Island are obviously not. In the movie we are supposed to believe that some of the hallucinations are actually happening, but you can tell that they are not right of the bat. That's not my only problem with them. Some of the hallucinations (especially the ones we are not supposed to believe) are just stupid. Like why did we need to see a thousand rats on the cliff, or his wife turn to ash and crumble? That's just me though. That's probally a complaint that not too many people share. And it really isn't a major problem, because it was not an accident. It was just a directional decision that I do not necessarily agree with. Nevertheless, that did not ruin the movie for me.<br /><br />I'm surprised at how alot of critics and moviegoers are reacting so negatively to this film. It's certainly not a bad movie. Not in the slightest. Of course if you compare it to Scorsese's other films, it will not hold up. But if some rookie director would have been behind the camera, alot of people probally would not have been so harsh on it. I think this movie has one of the biggest, and best mind-effing end twists that I have ever seen, although it's not hard to see coming. It's still a must see. And the transfer, as expected from a modern release, is top notch. Beautifully translated to Blu-ray. The extras on the other hand are lacking. Very much so in fact, but that doesn't hinder this from being one of the better thrillers on the market. Highly Recommended!not right of the bat. That's not my only problem with them.

As expected Ana and Christian get back together.<br />There is much less sex, virtually no real kinky sex, and a much more interesting plot. This part of the story is a very dark turbulent romance. Some good twists and turns. Highly recommended.
B000UR9T82|5.0|Following the cult classic status of Blade and the surprising box office success of X-Men, Marvel decided to lend out the rights of another one of their most cherished characters. Based on the success of the cartoons, this was sure to pull in a very specific demographic, but I doubt they expected it to be as popular as it became. It surpassed the success of X-Men, and ushered in a decade that would have many more comic book, cartoon, and toy movies set records. For too many years, these types of properties did not get the respect they deserved as real dramatic and action movies, and not just dumb superhero fun. Spider-Man finally got that due respect. The weekend it came out, my focus was on Star Wars Episode II, but after I saw Spider-Man I was blown away. Like many others of my generation, my fandome really started with the first Spidey film, and then blossomed into collecting stacks upon stacks of comics.

Topping a film as great as that one is a definite challenge, but it seems to happen more and more each passing year. Sequals like this one, X2: X-Men United, T2: Judgement Day, The Dark Knight, and others all have one thing in common. Beyond just being a \\"sequal\\", they managed to outdo their predecessors in almost every way. Spider-Man 2 is not only a great sequal, it is one of the best comic book movies ever made. It doesn't go for the mature adult feel that The Dark Knight has. On the contrary, Spider-Man 2 maintains that corny camp and tongue-in-cheek humor that made the first one so good. Sure some of the dialogue is cheesy at times, and the action is never tries to be realistic, but isn't that why we go to these movies? To be virtually thrilled to the point of exhaustion? Okay, maybe that's taking it a bit far, but my point remains that these films don't need to strive for realism. Their fantasy elements and use of childlike imagination and wonder are what make them so great.<br /><br />Its about a man with spider-like abilities fighting a man with mechanical tentacles attached to his back. The only thing I felt was lacking in TDK, is very abundant in Spidey 2. There is great humor, and the movie has the overall feel of an actual comic book. I also got a sense of the director and writers respect for their source material, but not being afraid to have fun with it. The ending of this film gave me chills the first few times I saw it. It wasn't until Spider-Man 3 actually came out, that the end of Spidey 2 lost some of its magic. Spider-Man 2 is in a solid second place on the list of my favorite comic book movies of all time. Right above films like The Avengers, Sin City, Iron Man, etc. There is really only one thing I didn't like about the movie. There were too many close-ups of random women screaming. It was okay once or twice, but not four or five times. That's minor though. This movie was a fine achievement. As for the Blu-ray transfer. Is it as great as the first one's? An emphatic yes! Even better, in fact. The adundance of detail and clarity are remarkable. This disc is a reference disc to show how amazing catalogue blockbusters can look.<br /><br />As far as Spider-Man 3 goes, I want start off by saying that I like this movie. Probally more than you do. With that said, I'll also add that it does serve its purpose, which is to prove that any Spider-Man movie will have great special effects, fine character development, okay acting, and make a shitload of money. Spider-Man 3 is a good film in its own right, but only a decent one when put in the tall dark shadow of its amazing, and incredibly revolutionary predecessors. It does not add much of value to the franchise, aside from introducing some of the most popular characters in Spidey's publication history. That said, those characters aren't given the attention and respect they deserve. They feel more like late additions that were shoehorned in. Overall the movie was not terrible though. It was definitely better than both of the Fantastic 4 movies, Ghost Rider, Elektra, and Daredevil, as well as some other less than savory comic book adaptations. The only thing that really held this movie down were the, not one, but two unnecessary dance scenes, and underdeveloped characters. The worst of the two dance scenes was Peter walking down the street like he was in a music video. The second dance scene reminded me of the jazz flute scene in Anchorman. That should never be. Those scenes made me feel like Sam Raimi was too comfortable with the fact that the movie would make alot of money, and there was no major competition in the superhero/comic book movie department, besides a few hits and a couple of upcoming challengers.<br /><br />That may have been passable in the summer of 2007, but now we have The Avengers saga and The Dark Knight trilogy that have set the bar so high that movies like them should be treated with the utmost respect and care. The addition of Gwen Stacy seemed rather pointless to me, unless they planned on ellaborating on the love triangle between her, Peter, and Mary Jane from the comics in later installments that never came to fruition. The running time was noticably longer than the previous two films, and it felt like a bloated Thanksgiving turkey. There's no reason the two dance scenes should have made the final cut. Some editors and directors don't understand what truly qualifies as a \\"Deleted Scene\\". Aside from the dance scenes, perhaps the biggestissue I have with this film is the treatment of my all-time favorite Spidey villain, Venom. Venom was so obviously a late addition to the script that it made me mad. And in addition to that, he was not the towering, manacing presence that we know him as. I must admit though, I loved the wonderful, yet very predictable team-ups of Spider-Man and the New Goblin versus Sandman and Venom. That really brought something to the movie when it was in desperate need of a kick-start. Spidey 3 was not the disaster it has so often been called by geeks and armchair critics alike, but it wasn't an achievement either.<br /><br />Now for the Blu-ray treatment of this rather mid-level, if slightly above average comic book film. Simply put, it's reference quality. The audio and video transfers are pretty much flawless. The extras are incredibly thorough and comprehensive as well. This trilogy is one of the best looking and sounding sets on the market. The only flaw with the set, aside from the decrease in quality entering the third installment, is the lack of extras on the first two discs. Overall though, this set is Highly Recommended, but the re-releases of the first two films are better than the first two discs in this set.of money.

The worst of the two dance scenes was Peter walking down the street like he was in a music video. The second dance scene reminded me of the jazz flute scene in Anchorman. That should never be. Those scenes made me feel like Sam Raimi was too comfortable with the fact that the movie would make alot of money, and there was no major competition in the superhero/comic book movie department, besides a few hits and a couple of upcoming challengers.<br /><br />That may have been passable in the summer of 2007, but now we have The Avengers saga and The Dark Knight trilogy that have set the bar so high that movies like them should be treated with the utmost respect and care. The addition of Gwen Stacy seemed rather pointless to me, unless they planned on ellaborating on the love triangle between her, Peter, and Mary Jane from the comics in later installments that never came to fruition. The running time was noticably longer than the previous two films, and it felt like a bloated Thanksgiving turkey. There's no reason the two dance scenes should have made the final cut. Some editors and directors don't understand what truly qualifies as a \\"Deleted Scene\\". Aside from the dance scenes, perhaps the biggestissue I have with this film is the treatment of my all-time favorite Spidey villain, Venom. Venom was so obviously a late addition to the script that it made me mad. And in addition to that, he was not the towering, manacing presence that we know him as. I must admit though, I loved the wonderful, yet very predictable team-ups of Spider-Man and the New Goblin versus Sandman and Venom. That really brought something to the movie when it was in desperate need of a kick-start. Spidey 3 was not the disaster it has so often been called by geeks and armchair critics alike, but it wasn't an achievement either.<br /><br />Now for the Blu-ray treatment of this rather mid-level, if slightly above average comic book film. Simply put, it's reference quality. The audio and video transfers are pretty much flawless. The extras are incredibly thorough and comprehensive as well. This trilogy is one of the best looking and sounding sets on the market. The only flaw with the set, aside from the decrease in quality entering the third installment, is the lack of extras on the first two discs. Overall though, this set is Highly Recommended, but the re-releases of the first two films are better than the first two discs in this set.
B005LAIIRQ|1.0|Why didn't they make spears by sharpening sticks?  Seven large, strong men with spears could have wiped out the whole pack.<br /><br />That's just one example of a bad story that's just too unbelievable.  A survival story without any real weapons, serious food gathering, shelter building or signal making is ridiculous.  The drawn out emotional drama only emphasizes how the movie fails to depict a realistic story of survival where all remaining energies must be focused on survival.
B000HT3JNY|4.0|I have to admit that Click surprised me. I passed on it when it was in theatres, and at the time it seemed like a great decision. I happened to catch it on television a few months after its home video release, and it was a lot better than I thought it would be. Honestly, I don't understand the hate for this movie. I thought Adam Sandler actually gave a solid performance, with a decent range in emotion. In fact, I think this was one of his best, not that his others are much to compare to (with the exception of a couple). Don't take that the wrong way. I do like his some of movies, but I dislike more than I like. Unlike most of his others, Click was not all middle school jokes. Not all middle school jokes, but still too much for my taste. If there were not so much dog on duck action I would consider it a better film. Unfortunately it does have more than enough, so it becomes hard to take the film too seriously at first. I like it though, despite the flaws. I think the message is very good. A lot of business men and women do not put enough time aside for their families. I was reluctant, but ultimately liked the shifts in tone, from typical Happy Madison dumb comedy to grown up drama towards the end. The few sad scenes really struck a nerve with me. I felt sorry for Sandler's character when he could not do anything to help his situation, even as he began to discover the flaws in his personality and lifestyle.<br /><br />Click is obviously a comedy, but I don't necessarily like it for its comedic elements. There were three or four scenes that struck a nerve and made my eyes somewhat well up. I know, I know, but it's true. Hey if you were looking for the regular Sandler flick, then I understand your disappointment. I'm actually happy that he did something out of his norm, because his norm sucks! At times it ended up feeling a little like his other depressing movies Reign Over Me, and mostly Funny People. I liked that, because I like those two movies. The film is complicated, yet so simple. I really can't explain that statement, but hopefully if you were to watch it, you'd see what I mean. The plot was simple - A hard working architect busted his ass all day, and night, every day to provide the best possible life for his family. He also happened to be pushing them away in the process. So one night he goes on the journey of a life time in about an hour and twenty minutes, and comes out a new person. I appreciated the effort that went into the project, and the finished product as well. The transfer could use some work, but it's a great improvement over the DVD for sure. Detail is much better, colors are well preserved. I recommend this one.ed, yet so simple. I really can't explain that statement, but hopefully if you were to watch it, you'd see what I mean.

B004YW4L5K|5.0|I love Neil Gaiman - he is not my favorite Author, but he is in the top ten and an important voice in my generation. I love his mix of relevance and the fantastic. I felt a little like I was getting hit on the head with this book at times - but patience paid off - I think the Odyssey nature of this book was instrumental in the end. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />The Kindle version was flawless - again as it should be. There was nothing to hinder the read.
B002ZG99CM|5.0|Right before this film came out in theaters, I watched the original for the first time ever to prepare for it. After the original ended, I was so happy with it that I had little faith that the remake would be nearly as good. I'm even happier to say that I believe this new version is slightly better. I know many will not agree, because they grew up on the original and it's such a major offense to challenge that nostalgia. I'm sorry. I didn't grow up with the original, and I like them both almost equally. I really felt the bond that developed between Dre Parker (Smith) and Mr. Han (Chan). Jackie Chan surprised me in this dramatic role. I mean, he cried! Jackie Chan freaking cried! And it was believable how heartfelt his character moments were. I certainly gained a new respect for him as an actor. Jaden Smith did a little bit of crying himself, and guess what, he was believable too. I do not quite get why everyone hates the kid just because he was born into a perfect life. He has genuine acting talent. And his coaches couldn't be better.<br /><br />Yes the acting was superb, in my opinion, with the exception of the girl that Dre liked. She was not bad, but she wasn't good either. As for the story, I liked it. I liked a lot. In fact, as a remake, I understand the core elements are identical, but the set up was much better in this one. I think the premise of a younger lead moving all the way to China is better for the whole \\"fish-out-of-water\\" feeling. I think Mr. Miyagi is the shit and beyond, but Mr. Han was great. Yes it is a crowd pleaser, but it was still a damn good one. As for the transfer. It's incredibly crisp. Video and audio are reference for a film with little, to no CGI effects.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|Sadly I JUST got around to reading this book. As a Pratchett and Gaiman fan I found it more than enjoyable. It was rather easy to tell who influenced which parts for the most part - but it still read beautifully. If I wasn't familiar with their relative styles, I don't think I'd notice. The commentaries by the authors in this edition were a nice add. A relevant book with the usual British cheekiness and irreverence that I personally love. I think I'll go listen to \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" now...<br /><br />As for the Kindle format - it was flawless - as most any publication from the last 2 decades should be.
B007L4HET8|4.0|I want start off by saying that I like this movie. Probally more than you do. With that said, I'll also add that it does serve its purpose, which is to prove that any Spider-Man movie will have great special effects, fine character development, okay acting, and make a shitload of money. Spider-Man 3 is a good film in its own right, but only a decent one when put in the tall dark shadow of its amazing, and incredibly revolutionary predecessors. It does not add much of value to the franchise, aside from introducing some of the most popular characters in Spidey's publication history. That said, those characters aren't given the attention and respect they deserve. They feel more like late additions that were shoehorned in. Overall the movie was not terrible though. It was definitely better than both of the Fantastic 4 movies, Ghost Rider, Elektra, and Daredevil, as well as some other less than savory comic book adaptations.

B004RE29PO|5.0|I want to preface by saying that I own the Alien Anthology, but because this is my favorite of the series (with Alien a very close second), I felt like devoting an entire review to just this one.<br /><br />James Cameron's sci-fi action thriller, Aliens, is well deservedly held as one of the greatest action films ever made. The man undoubtably has a way with sequels, no if ands or buts about it. When I first saw this film, a few years back, I went to it thinking I was about to watch a straight action film. Well, I was quite wrong. There are some great scenes involving guns and big mechanical suits, but I would still argue that the strongest aspect of this film is its thrilling suspense (and 80's vibe...I kid). What I would call it, besides science fiction and action, is one of the best horror films involving aliens that I have ever seen. There were a few scenes that got my heart racing. For it's time, the visuals are not half bad, but that doesn't make a movie. The character development is all there. Even the characters that were bound to meet their fates early in the mission are given depth that you do not see in many movies like this. I got to know every crew member's personality, and that's a big plus. Not to mention the actors did a fine job at bringing the characters to life. Sigourney Weaver is a damn fine lead ad Ellen Ripley, finally back home only fifty-seven short years after her previous encounter with the Xenomorphs on the planet LV-246. It's quite apparent that she did NOT have fun on her trip.<br /><br />She's tough, yet very complex. And we see that complexity when she finds Newt, the only survivor from her colony on the planet. The supporting cast was very good as well. Particualrly, Michael Beihn as Hicks. I was glad to see he and Cameron working together two years after their success with The Terminator. Bill Paxton was also a pleasant surprise as an annoying meathead named Private Hudson. Besides the character development and acting, there was another big plus. Something I mentioned before was that the movie was actually scary. Alot of these types of movies go for cheap scares, and end up coming off very cheesy. Not the case here. If it didn't scare you, that's fine, but I don't feel bad admitting that it scared me a few times. The Xenomorphs are not creatures I'd go after, no matter how many weapons I had. Something else important that I have not mentioned is the cool factor that Aliens has. I mentioned there were guns and mechanical suits, but that's completely downplaying it. The flamethrower was awesome, and it seemed like the characters were using it in a practical way, rather than just showing it off. The grenade launcher was cool too. But none of that outdoes the mech suit that Ripley used to fight the Xenomorph Queen. That was a tense, and excitiing scene. The other aliens scared me a little bit, but when the queen detached from her body from the egg pump and chased Ripley and Newt to the ship, I was intense. Perhaps I'm exaggerating a bit, but it was still pretty awesome.<br /><br />The score was terrific as well. The music is one of the most important aspects of a horror movie, well every genre really, but horror even more. If the music was not so eerie and tense, I wouldn't have been as scared those few times that I was. James Horner and James Cameron work very well together. As far as I'm concerned, James Cameron could make all science fiction movies for the rest of his career. He has quite the track record for classics in the genre. Now for the transfer of this iconic classic. Simply put, it's fantastic. The restoration was very well done, and Aliens looks and sounds ever better than expected. Definitely a Must Own.ther big plus. Something I mentioned before was that the movie was actually scary. Alot of these types of movies go for cheap scares, and end up coming off very cheesy.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|i enjoyed each and everybook of the trilogy i myself have experienced an s& m relationship so i was able to feel everything anastasia was feeling and was able to relate to what was going on. people frown upon this type of relationship but if you find the right master it can be just as rewarding as any other relationship
B000M5AJQI|5.0|Without question, Scosese is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. His pention for telling top notch criminal parables is practically unrivaled. Many would probably argue that Coppola is at the top of that list, but I'd put my money on Scorsese. I've been a fan of The Departed since I first saw it in theaters. I was a fifteen-year-old rookie, when it came to film, who had not had the pleasure of being acquainted to the plethora of crime classics out there. I later bought it on DVD and watched it a bunch of times, and considered this the Holy Grail of its genre. These however many years later, I've become much more of a film enthusiast, and I've seen many more mob and crime movies. So with more of a well-rounded perspective on the subject, I can still proudly say that this is my favorite mob movie, and possibly my favorite Scorsese film. This is definitely one of the best films I have ever seen, period. I always knew it was excellent, but I never really took the time to reflect on just how great it really is. Martin Scorsese is one hell of a director. He is a master at his craft. I need to do some research because I would swear that Martin Scorses is a gangster himself. He has to have ties to the mafia. He crafts such perfect gangster movies that it is hard not to think he has personal experience. I guess some guys are just that good telling stories. And his cast coudn't be better. Well if Samuel L. Jackson was in it, then it would be better, but even without him it's perfect.<br /><br />It's pretty obvious why Scorsese has Leonardo DiCaprio in a lot of his pictures these days. The guy is fantastic. Jack Nicholson is pure genious, as always. His mannerisms are unbelievable, and he delivers lines with a beauty that we don't see very often on screen. Matt Damon, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone and the sexy Vera Farmiga round out the all-star cast. My personal favorite perfomance, after Jack Nicholson, is Mark Wahlberg though. His character made me crack a smile almost everytime he spoke, or started a fight. There were great performances all around. I always pay attention to the music, and Howard Shore's (LOTR trilogy, and so many others) score is excellent. I'll leave the debates about Internal Affairs being much better alone. For my money, I love this movie, and don't care to debate it. I won't summarize the story either, because I doubt that anyone has not seen this movie. But if by some chance you haven't, you really need to, as soon as possible. All I will say about it, is that the last twenty minutes are some of the best film that modern American Cinema has to offer. Actually the entire movie is. And the Blu-ray presentation is stellar. It's a definite must-see, and a must own. Highly Recommended!a smile almost everytime he spoke, or started a fight. There were great performances all around.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|First let me say that I have never been a fan of anything Star Trek related, until I saw this movie when it hit theaters in the summer of 2009. I've been a fan of the Star Wars saga for a while, and have never even made an attempt to get into Star Trek. That said, this is one of the greatest science fiction films to be released in the last couple of decades. Without a shadow of a doubt, it's definitely in my top ten of 2009, and that's saying a lot because that was a stellar year for film, and the sci-fi genre (with Avatar, Moon and District 9). This is what summer action blockbusters are supposed to be. The action is not the only thing that makes Star Trek amazing though. In my opinion, it's not even the best thing about the movie. I love the multi-dimensional relationships between the eventual crew of the Enterprise. Zachary Quinto's casting was a questionable decision at first, but he soon proved to be the perfect choice to play Spock. Chris Pine shot up to number two on my list of favorite overly self-confident, cocky leads. Right behind Robert Downey Jr. in Iron Man, and before Christian Bale in Batman. His portrayal of James T. Kirk is simply brilliant. The two of them share some of the best scenes, bickering throughout the film, like an old married couple. The rest of the cast is fantastic as well.<br /><br />Zoe Saldana is great as Uhura, in the first of her two amazing sci-fi movies of 2009. The unrecognizable Eric Bana is terrifying as the Romulan villain Nero. My second favorite performance in the film is Simon Pegg as a hilarious Scottish engineer, cleverly named Scotty. These are just a few names in a cast full of great performances, and surprising cameos. The first time I watched it in theatres I had a little trouble getting past Anton Yelchin's accent as Chekov, but after a few more views it stopped bothering me. Overall, I love JJ Abram's Star Trek. Abrams is already one of my favorite filmmakers of this generation. I consider him one of the best science fiction minds we have in the industry today. Before I saw this film I would never have imagined myself getting excited for a Star Trek movie. It's good enough to turn a devoted Star Wars fan into somewhat of a Trekky. I still can't watch the tv series though. Honestly, it bores me. But as far as the rebooted franchise goes, it's gold. Great Movie. And the transfer is pure reference quality. No question, this is a must own Blu-ray. The extras are so incredibly thorough that it's worth it to search for this release, and stay far away from the single disc version.

B002NXSRX4|3.0|When G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra first hit theaters I ignored it. It looked as bad to me as everyone was making it out to be. But then I actually went to see the movie near the end of its theatrical run, well after hearing and reading all of the negative feedback ang giving the negative feedback time to sink in. I decided to see it any way because it was one of the last few movies in theatres that I hadn't seen that summer. I had a choice to see G.I. Joe, or whatever chick flick my mom was going to see. Obviously, I chose the former. It actually turned out to be a pretty big surprise. I definitely liked it about as much as I liked Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, which I still like to this day, despite the never ending insults from people who hate the movie. Going into it with low expectations turned out to be a very good thing. There were complaints about the quality of the CGI, but I didn't have any problems with it. Even with near reference picture quality, I stil don't find much to complain about in the special effects department. They aren't flawless, but they are still very convincing, and not distracting at all. There were also alot of complaints that important G.I. Joe material from the cartoon and comics was missing, but people should understand that this should really be considered a prequal to what fans of the old cartoons and comics consider \\"the real G.I. Joe\\". It's the \\"Rise of Cobra\\".<br /><br />In the end, Rise of Cobra was actually a fun summer blockbuster, in my opinion, because it doesn't take itself too seriously, they experiment with creative ideas for futuristic military technology, and when the big budget of this movie is on display, it really becomes a visual treat. There were some nice flashbacks that filled in all the gaps, and the end was a nice lead into part two. I also liked that Stephen Sommers had a few cameos of a few of his Mummy stars. Speaking of The Mummy, that's the type of feel this movie has. The material is obviously cheesy, but it's all about having fun while you're watching it. I also liked how fleshed out the story felt, from start to finish, with intercut flashbacks to fill in backstory. Marlon Wayans and Channing Tatum are well hated among the geek community, but while I didn't find their acting impressive, I still don't think they were bad enough for people to get so riled up. I don't know. Maybe there are more important things worth hating to me. So overall the story is pretty solid, in my opinion. I'm sure that's pretty much everyone would beg to differ, but I'm okay with that. At least we can all agree that this Blu-ray has a terrific all around transfer. The extras are a little light though. The few extras are interesting though. So in the end, I recommend G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra as a rental for general film enthusiasts. For lack of a better term, snobs should avoid it completely.sy, but it's all about having fun while you're watching it.

B001NEK2GE|5.0|I had previously purchased a Nostromo and didn't like the feel of the keys or the way it forced my hand to its ergonomic shape. Logitech keys feel better to me and I like that it feels more like a keyboard when I rest my hand on it. It's really just a user preference. The Nostromo performed well when I used it I just didn't like the feel.<br /><br />Also beware as I purchased this as a NEW item and received a returned item. While there was no visible scratches the plastic covering the screen was missing and I didn't even pay attention to that until a few days later at my brothers house he received the same thing, from Amazon competitor, and his had the plastic on the screen. I really don't mind used or refurb but when you're expecting NEW and get USED it cheapens the feeling toward the item. Everything works fine and I wasn't about to spend several days working on returning it and getting a new one shipped just because of this.<br /><br />From the past couple experiences with products from Amazon I'm less inclined to renew my Prime membership. I'll start to pay shipping and just go with whomever has the best price. I may also just start local shopping again since I know for a fact I'll always get NEW.
B000002OX7|5.0|If I had just one CD to listen to the rest of my life I'd pick Who's Next.<br /><br />Who's Next starts out with Baba O' Riley, which in my opinion is about maturity and independence. It's an amazing song that will draw you into the music right away. Then comes Bargain, my favorite track on the album because I can't help but start singing and rocking to it every time. This Song is Over is a great rock anthem. Then comes Getting in Tune, a great piano centric song. Going Mobile and Behind Blue Eyes I don't care much for. Of course, everyone's favorite Won't Get Fooled Again comes after. The rest of the album is kind of meh though.

B0047JJDOE|4.0|J.W. Rinzler's The Making of Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back isn't so much a book about the making as much as it is a collection of primary materials and documentation about the making, including copious interviews, photos, and scans of original documents. It's great for dedicated Star Wars fans and is (and will be) a treasure for historians. However, the text itself is pretty dry and is mostly a straight retelling of what happened, when and where. Rinzler uses primary interviews to tell much of the story and it's great to hear the voices of the men and women involved in making the movie.<br /><br />However, because the book tries to be a comprehensive chronological retelling, that means it jumps around and never really presents a single narrative. For example, a chapter might discuss problems filming in Norway, McQuarrie's conceptual drawings, and the latest rewrite of the script. This makes it difficult to follow something like the development of the story because it's all spread out.<br /><br />Overall, this book is a treasure and valuable resource, but it's not necessarily the book you're looking for if you just want to learn more about the making of the film. If you just want to learn about the development of the script and story, I highly recommend [[ASIN:0978465237 The Secret History of Star Wars]], which presents a story almost as exciting as the films themselves. I recommend reading that book first, and then reading Rinzler's book to transport yourself back in history to see the making itself.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|AMAZING. I have known about Frank Ocean for a while ever since I heard  the song \\"swim good\\".  But I really became a fan when I heard \\"Pyramids\\"  and  \\"Bad Religion\\".  As soon as I heard that his CD CHANNEL ORANGE  came out like a week before it was due, I immediately ordered it on amazon.  And When I received it in the mail like several days later, I popped it into my computer and just listened. He is an amazing artist with breath taking lyrics and beats. Franks lyrics are deep and thats what so good about it. It comes from the heart and it has meaning. If you're looking for a great album to just chill and listen to , whether in a car or at home on the couch. Get this CD

B007L3BMGA|1.0|I read the book from cover to cover to make an informed opinion. The only opinion I formed was disgust in myself for wasting valuable time and to write twenty words about this product will be tantamount to acknowledge that the book is indeed a product. It is not a product that was worth producing let alone buying. If I didn't have to give it a star I wouldn't.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I was a bit skeptical about this movie from just hearing a friend's overview of it, but it turned out to be one of my new favorite DVDs. With a star studded cast, RED is a movie I'd describe as funny and action packed with just a bit of romance following a \\"who done it\\" plot. I'd recommend it to all  my friends, family, and even my grandparents. The DVD itself shipped quickly and was in great shape. This is a must have for every collection.
B006LSZECO|2.0|While nearly all the characters in this book were over-the-top dysfunctional, I was drawn into the story enough to keep reading --- right up to the point that I felt the author reach into my pocket and steal $12.99 from me. It was as if she got tired of writing, and just stopped. There are better books out there. Try the classic \\"Rebecca\\", if you want a book with twists and turns you don't expect.
B007SGM084|2.0|Was not what I expected. Very poorly written.  Lots of repetitive words and phrases throughout.  Really surprized at Random House for publishing it.
0062206281|3.0|And so we come to the third book in the series.<br />Other reviewers have already told most of the plot.  Also they have written \\"Be sure to read The Shadow of the Wind and The Angel's Game first.  I agree.<br /><br />But this book is mainly about Fermin Romero de Torres...and that alone would make it a worthy successor to Zafon's classic, The Shadow of the Wind.  He has been the comic relief in the other stories and now we see some of the tragedy of his...w/o his loss of mischievous repartee.<br /><br />Oh, the plot twists and turns.<br />I can't blame Zafon for writing more and more in this series.  The Shadow of the Wind really is the classic.  As these other tales pour out from Carlos Zafon, they are not golden as his first book, but we will always have Barcelona!
B00005Q45W|5.0|Douglas Wolk's opinion aside, (everyone has one), its a joy to have this lost lamb return to its fold (my collection).  Leonard is a man who sees life through the common man's eye's.  His ability to arrange common English words in an unusual fashion is beyond remarkable.  I lost this album through corruption of the original CD some time ago and have just gotten around to replacing it.  That's not to say I didn't miss it, I have, very much so.  In my opinion, this terrific album ranks among his very best.  Maybe Douglas Wolk should retire to a monestary and spend some time contemplating his objectivity when reviewing artists works.<br /><br />Bravo Leonard! Merci!  Merci!  Merci!
B006FE83UE|4.0|I just re-read the original after a number of years. I loved the writing and the \\"southernisms\\" that reconnected me to the years I lived in the south (Texas, Alabama, Florida and North Carolina) and the travel I have done there. When I finished the copy I borrowed from the library, I suddenly realized how much I enjoyed reading it again and wondered why I did not have a copy in my own library. I'm glad this edition was available and have added it to my collection of favorite books. What a great example of southern culture of that time and the courage of a man for whom choosing to do the right thing was more important than what might happen afterwards. Scout was a great spokesperson.

He is found ducked away in his basement library and forced into the public eye.

How do we confront the situation?<br /><br />There is nothing unique about the story. However the acting is pretty good and it does have a shocking ending.
B0042U94UQ|4.0|\\"Despicable Me\\" draws inevitable comparisons to \\"Megamind\\": Two animated films about supervillains-turned-heroes came out in 2010. I loved \\"Megamind\\" so I was curious to see how \\"Despicable Me\\" would stack up. It's a close race.<br /><br />\\"Despicable Me\\"'s main protagonist is Gru (Steve Carell, almost unrecognizable with his faux-Slavic accent), a washed-up supervillain who lives in a pleasant suburban neighborhood. When rival supervillain and Bill Gates-lookalike Vector (Jason Segel) steals the Great Pyramid of Gaza, Gru's professional reputation is at stake.  Goaded on by his Twinkie-like minions and ancient mad scientist Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand), Gru decides to kidnap the moon.<br /><br />Gru is not a nice person.  He kidnaps (and possibly kills) dogs, he mocks children, and he thinks nothing of adopting three adorable moppets and manipulating them into stealing a shrink ray from Vector. Said moppets consist of sensible and eldest Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), toughie Edith (Dana Gaier), and adorable Agnes (Elsie Fisher). The three girls are not particularly fleshed out - Edith is practically silent - but you get the impression that it takes three adorable kids to make us forget that Gru's kind of a jerk.<br /><br />What's more surprising is how \\"Despicable Me\\" points the finger at the disparity between old and new villainy.  Gru is quaint in his anachronistic ways, from his house to his super-weapons, and he takes on the role of a benevolent boss to his adoring minions.  His biggest flaw appears to be his European heritage, a bygone relic of global politics that no longer apply.  Gru's form of evil has been unseated by corporations, by technology, and most of all by banks.  The Bank of Evil, to be precise, who is only willing to fund nefarious plans led by younger villains - and if there happens to be a bit of nepotism involved, so much the better.<br /><br />Of course, we know that Gru will come to love the three little tikes, that he will rise to the occasion to defend them, and that he will have to make a choice between his supervillain ambitions and his new role as a guardian.<br /><br />Unlike \\"Megamind,\\" which contrasted Gen X and Gen Y superhero archetypes, \\"Despicable Me,\\" is much more interested in entertaining the kiddies. The minions are pure audience fodder, there to act as slapstick asides when the action lags.  Other than his fondness for aquatic animal-based weaponry and his Microsoft-stylized lair, Vector has no character development. And the issue of Gru's archvillainy is sidestepped by incompetence, not because he truly has a change of heart.<br /><br />But then, \\"Despicable Me\\" was never interested in changing the world.  It's content to settle for the moon.  And with its marginally scaled-down ambitions, that's enough for most kids (and their parents).to defend them, and that he will have to make a choice between his supervillain ambitions and his new role as a guardian.<br /><br />Unlike \\"Megamind,\\" which contrasted Gen X and Gen Y superhero archetypes, \\"Despicable Me,\\" is much more interested in entertaining the kiddies.

0143038419|2.0|I had a gut reaction of revulsion to this book like many other negative reviewers but I respect and can understand why some people really loved it. To me, it is very clearly linked to what class and level of privilege you come from. That is not intended to be a judgment, it is just an observation based on the people I know who liked it vs. the people who didn't. The book was recommended to me by two people who are from similarly privileged backgrounds as Gilbert.  They absolutely loved it, and they too have the luxury to travel and navel gaze for months on end.  Given that, I can understand why it really appealed to them and why others like them would too.  Myself, not so much.  The financial reality of taking a year off and traveling to find myself is incomprehensible, it is not likely to be a reality in my lifetime. Even more than a week would be hard to imagine and I consider taking that much time off a privilege in and of itself. The luxury that comes with the ability to take extended time off and contemplate your inner self after a tragedy is also something I do not relate to.<br /><br />There are a lot of things that can go terribly wrong in a lifetime and if you don't have a choice to take much time off when they happen because you may end up homeless, it can force you to look at and handle a major setback in a much less extravagant manner than someone from Gilbert's background. That's not to say that the people who do not have Gilbert's privilege handle setbacks better, it is just another reason why those people may not like this book. To each their own, this is how she chose to spend her time off, focused on finding herself so that she would no longer be as unhappy or depressed. To me, one less unhappy person in the world no matter what their background is a good thing, I just wasn't interested in reading about her approach.
B004EPZ03O|4.0|The Muppets have always been a curious relic of a bygone era of entertainment, much like Bugs Bunny and the rest of the Looney Tunes gang.  They still carry the torch for vaudeville, only in the case of the Muppets it's a show about putting on a show.  The \\"Muppet Show\\" regularly broke the fourth wall in a way that only stage performers can, but that meta-awareness has since become rote in the age of hyper-media saturation. Can the Muppets still be relevant in the Internet era?<br /><br />\\"The Muppets\\" wisely doesn't try to update the titular puppets so much as resurrect them, reintroducing Kermit (Steve Whitmire) and company in a \\"get the gang back together to save the show\\" plot.  It works, because it's the Muppets, and cheesy is what they do.<br /><br />Less successful are the dual narratives at the center of the film.  Gary (Jason Segel) and Walter (Peter Linz) are brothers with one important difference: Gary is a human and Walter is a Muppet.  Gary has grown up and has a girlfriend Mary (adorable Amy Adams, who looks like she was pregnant through most of the film).  Walter has...his obsession with the Muppets.  These two worlds are destined to collide on a fateful road trip Hollywood.<br /><br />The abandoned Muppet studio is in a sorry state, and it soon becomes clear that Kermit and Miss Piggy (Eric Jacobson) have broken up. With the rest of the Muppets scattered, it's up to our heroes to convince Kermit to reunite with his beloved, get the band back together (literally), and put on a show that will raise $10 million before villainous oil baron Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) can get his hands on the plot.<br /><br />What ensues is a series of madcap homages to other films, subtle references to Muppet canon, and lots of plot-bending gags like \\"traveling by map.\\" These jokes aren't so much funny as they are ironic, which is what the Muppet always excelled at.  Jack Black, playing himself, demonstrates the brilliance of the Muppets when Fozzie Bear (Eric Jacobson) begins a lame routine and Black reacts by mocking him.  The audience eats it up, and we do too - not because the Muppets are always funny, but because they're always game, often lame, and in on the joke.<br /><br />Different plot points resolve at their own pace, and to Segel's writing credit, almost all of them resolve in a satisfactory fashion.  Villains are defeated, romances rekindled, and our beloved Muppets play all the songs we remember best.  The funniest gags comes from a new Muppet, 80's Robot (Matt Vogel), who is there exclusively to keep us Gen Xers entertained.<br /><br />Unfortunately the weakest link is central to the film.  Walter is a generic Muppet with almost no character development other than his adoration of Kermit. When he is called upon in the eleventh hour to find his talent, it feels as fabricated as his body.<br /><br />But I can't be too harsh on the Muppets.  Although the movie's not really for kids, the secret to the Muppets was that it never was.  This is the best resurrection a fan could ask for.egins a lame routine and Black reacts by mocking him.

B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is an awesome app...I can't believe. it's FREE! I love that I can create custom sounds and save them to play again. I also love that I can set a sleep timer so I can play it falling asleep but it won't drain my battery all night! The only thing I wish it did was play in the background while I read or play games...will have to see if the premium version does.

B000MKD9P6|1.0|First off, the digital quality is very poor, both in visible and audio formats. Secondly, the movie starts off great. Chick just graduates from college, and is searching for a job in NYC. For some strange reason she is offered a post as a secretary in a fashion magazine, even though she wants to be a journalist at anything else but a fashion magazine. So, apparently, she cannot get a job that she wants, but thinks this one might be the job before the job she wants, though how anyone can believe that a secretary job in a field she dislikes can get her a writing job in a field she wants is beyond me.<br />Secondly, the entire theme of the move is \\"Go try and be successful but if trying to be a better person changes you then you should be ashamed of yourself.\\" It preaches that to be successful, you have to sacrifice everything good in your life, and that people that are successful are unhappy and lonely.<br />So, every beautiful dress and handbag, every beautiful blouse and shoe, created by hours of work by successful fashion designers in that movie has now been washed in the pond scum puddle of anti-successful feelings.

0425263908|3.0|The book itself was great. I gave it only three stars because I do not like the fact that I need to wait until October-December to read the next two novels that follow the story line. By then I will have read several other books and will need to go back and read the last chapter again to get up to speed.
0345803507|1.0|the other two books were torelable, i was able to engage regardless of the bad writing and repetition, however the third book is unnecessary. it is very slow and arduous. normally, i take one day  to read a book, however this book is still unfinished, after two weeks of force feeding this book to my self , i had to stop torturing. i regret make this writer Rich..

B004JN1D2I|4.0|Books are really worth reading, they're agile and easy to follow, even when you're not following/don't like the TV series. Haighly recommended...<br /><br />The kindle edition is well suited, has a nice TOC with links and it's easy to use. I still think kindle editions are TOO EXPENSIVE for digital contents... come on, Amazon.... you don't have ANY cost hosting a digital file... and I don't think you're paying SO MUCH copyright fees so as to charge almost the same for both printed and digital editions.<br /><br />So, my advice is, if you have enough room to spare at home, just buy the printed edition.. you won't save much with the kindle edition... If you're like me: no room to store any more books... then you have no choice. You'll enjoy the reading whatever you choose :-P
B005LAIGZU|5.0|As prior service the flick was true to life on many aspects. It's still a movie. Even a soldier wouldn't be interested in wasting his/her time with watching a real life soldier cleaning their M4 or checking their CR123 batteries. The director and producers took the action scenes because god forbid action heroes don't actually use the restroom and real life soldiers don't share their feelings. You sometimes have to be a stone cold savage to not hesitate to do your job. It's hard for the cubicle jockey to understand why the actor didn't show more emotion or character. It's because if they did and questioned why the hell they did what they did they might hesitate and hurt the guys in the stick they were serving with.  This movie is but a glimpse of the world of pain and sacrifice that these people (and my father) gave/give so we the world can be as peaceful as it is. Remember though, it's a movie, not a documentary. It's got to be entertaining as well and so it does still make for an entertaining and patriotic movie. If its not patriotic for you, then sucks for me because I'm still fighting for you.
B007PKOKTK|2.0|I'm giving it 2 stars because it's cute but overall it was just a mess... It was predictable of course and very boring in between little small jokes
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is a great first book for E. L. James. It is definitely an erotic love story!  In fact, the story line is so engaging that mid-way through the book, I became desensitize to the sexual escapades, which were very often. The depth to which James wrote the characters made them jump off the page; they became real to me.  By the end of the book, I too had fallen in love with Christian Grey. I was sucked into the fifty shades and could not wait to read book two.  I couldn't download it fast enough on my Kindle. Now that I'm reading book two, it all only gets better.<br /><br />In the beginning of the book James' literary style is a bit elementary, even though she uses a lot \\"big\\" words. Her sentences are short and choppy and make the characters appear to be very formal, but by the end of the book the sentences are more fluid, which makes it easier to read.  Sometimes a run-on sentence is necessary to show natural dialogue.  I consider myself to have a pretty decent vocabulary but found myself looking up the definition of atleast one word on every page.  I understand the main characters are supposed to be well-read and intelligent, but some of the vocabulary choices are unnecessary and confusing.  It was hard to even define some words by the context of the sentences. I had to read some passages multiple times to understand what James was trying to convey.  She could have easily used more common words to get her point across.  However, I did learn some new words.<br /><br />Overall, I loved the book. I didn't give it five stars for the reasons noted above and I did not want to be misleading.  James writing-style definitely evolved, (not saying that it was bad to begin with), the characters evolved, and the plot thickened. I usually don't do sequels of any sort because they are never as good as the first but Fifty Shades is the exception. I have recommended this book to my friends and I continue to recommend it.

1907698345|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo25CY7H7IFWL1H]]<br /><br />ABOUT THE NEW ANTI-BRIBERY LEGISLATION: A BRILLIANT AND ACCESSIBLE GUIDE -- NEW FROM THE LAW SOCIETY WITH ACCOMPANYING CD ROM<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />As author Amy Bell says - and we all agree - `bribery is bad news for business.'  Apparently a quarter of UK-based international companies surveyed fairly recently said they had lost business to corrupt competitors in the previous five years.<br /><br />As for the financial penalties, these are formidable to say the least, if any of your clients get caught under the new legislation, namely the Bribery Act 2010, in force as of 1 July 2011.  Commercial organisations of any size must therefore, in the words of the Law Society, `review their procedures and look to their lawyers for the development of policies and training to establish anti-corruption safeguards.'<br /><br />The Law Society has duly produced three extremely informative and helpful new `toolkits', each designed to help practitioners cope with the new regulatory environment.  Produced in handy paperback format with accompanying CD, each `toolkit' contains supremely clear and practical advice that has emerged following this significant new legislation.  If you or your clients are or might be directly affected by the new legislation, you might decide to acquire all three, namely the `Anti-Bribery Toolkit'... `the COFAs Toolkit'... and the `COLPs Toolkit'.<br /><br />For purposes of this review, we are focusing on the `Anti-Bribery Toolkit' which contains draft policies, checklists and other instruments which will enable practitioners implement due diligence and  put the appropriate safeguards in place.<br /><br />Besides the anti-bribery policy itself, these materials include governance policies... communications to staff... risk management...  gifts and hospitality and more, including auditing.  The CD-ROM delivers a number of useful appendices, including relevant policies, draft communications and forms which you can easily download and distribute to colleagues, clients and staff alike, making sure that you have adapted these templates to specific situations or needs.<br /><br />For convenience, succinctness and clarity it would be difficult to surpass this toolkit and its companion volumes.  As the author, an expert in this field, manages the compliance team at Pannone LLP, the content therefore reveals a practical approach prepared with the busy practitioner very much in mind, particularly those who are sole practitioners.  Published in the summer of 2012, the book which includes the CD, is available from Law Society Publishing.dices, including relevant policies, draft communications and forms which you can easily download and distribute to colleagues, clients and staff alike, making sure that you have adapted these templates to specific situations or needs.<br /><br />For convenience, succinctness and clarity it would be difficult to surpass this toolkit and its companion volumes.

The story line is so believable and you feel as though you at right there involved in  the doings of this family.  Another great read by Mauve. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves her stories and who really can relate to the characters.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|In simple terms,...this book is unpleasant. I don't understand what all the hype was about this book. The storyline makes no sense, the characters are undeveloped and unrealistic, and the writing was off. The book threw me off when I found out this guy was into the kind of stuff he was in. I had a guest at my job tell me that he was surprised to see that women like this kind of stuff and surprised they thought like that after reading Fifty Shades of Grey. Did he not understand Anastasia? I hope that this doesn't give guys any ideas.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|VERY DISAPPOINTING. I was very enthusiastic about purchasing this item as some of my friends have the same \\"life proof\\" iPhone 4s pink case. A week after my purchase I dropped the phone while secured in its case. Today I just opened the case to charge with a older model adapter and noticed that the back of the phone is SHATTERED!! So much for shock proof....
B005EF1EX8|2.0|Breaking Bad is one of the best TV Dramas out now and Amazon is one of my favorite places to shop but this was NOT worth the money! On my scrawny 23\\" monitor it was pixelated and crappy looking. Just buy the HD version

B007SGM084|5.0|The book went straight to my kindle with no problems.  I was able to start reading the book within one minute.  The book is interesting and a great read for women.
B005FISBTO|1.0|I am a huge Dexter fan.  I love the books and loved the first 4 seasons, each of which was better than the one before.  The show started to slip a little bit in season five, but nothing too bad.  In this season, however, the writing in the show goes completely off the rails!!<br /><br />The biggest problem with the sixth season is that the new showrunners have absolutely no idea how to write their characters, so these characters end of acting completely OUT of character.  The worst of this is in the characterization of Dexter himself.  This builds up more and more as the season plods through one ridicuolous storyline after another, finally culminating in probably the dumbest \\"cliffhanger\\" ending EVER filmed.  I will not give away the ending in case anyone else wants to watch this wretched season for themselves, but suffice to say that the writers obviously had an intended final scene and were determined to have that scene, even if it meant throwing out every shred of common sense and believablity, as well as all characterization that had been built up in prior seasons.<br /><br />The acting performances are good, considering that the cast had so much nonsense to work with.  Jennifer Carpenter deserves special kudos for enduring her contrived storyline with her ex-husband, which can only be the result of someone in the writer's room REALLY hating her guts!<br /><br />Unless season seven makes some major improvements (starting with hiring writers who can actually plot out a story), then I will not be watching this show for much longer.
B00646YRW6|5.0|This video is a good rap-up of both the third season and the series.<br /><br />The 1st episode picks up one-year later. Two of the main characters are still in the Cretaceous Period, and the third (to be seen later in the series) is sill out there... six-million years ago. The 1st episode wraps things up fairly clean, and the moves on with the season's episodes, of which, several former characters are also seen later.<br /><br />The series continues with its proven formula, monsters from the past & future, defeating the badguys, & saving humanity. The effects and storyline line are good, fitting the past (I recommend getting all the previous seasons', and watching them all accordingly). You can't go wrong with this BBC series. It's inventve, creative, thrilling, somewhat educational, and best yet... not another \\"reality\\" show!
B003QP4BJM|4.0|A great history of the tech world,  and how it developed<br />a surprise on every page.  Yiu'jj feel better after this read<br /><br />Ed Moot

B006RUJST6|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Helps me to not take things for granted as much as I used to. Easy read. Full of warm fuzzies which bring life into perspective.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|this game is amazing. almost as amazing as spider-man. that pretty much sums up the game. if you didn't like spider man before you can't put it down now.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|A special book on ultra marathon, very interesting and full of notions. This book has given me real conscienca about how important is eating for running ultra and running in general. The book is really inspiring, and the receipt at the end of every chapter is an original idea. I would really recommend it.
B007MNV5WU|2.0|let me start by saying the game itself is awesome. I'm upset because not only did I have to pay $3 to download the app because I have a kindle fire but now the new update wiped out my progress AND I cant get the danger zone levels without paying MORE MONEY! I don't mind supporting the developers but this is a little ridiculous.
B007XNAQLA|5.0|The amount of creativity that went into the arrangement of each one of these classic tunes is amazing.  Chick's solo over top of the walking bass line of Stanley Clarke during the tune, After the Cosmic Rain, is one of my favorite moments of Return to Forever music ever.  Finally, a no prisoners taken blowout version of School Days has been released.  The sophisticated blending of the Shadow of Lo from, Where Have I Known You Before, with Sorceress from Romantic Warrior with its numerous twists and turns is another highlight of this release.  Jean-Luc Ponty's every solo adds a large touch of energy and classicism to each tune.  You expect greatness from Chick, Stanley, Lenny and Jean-Luc, but I was surprised and then amazed by Frank Gambale's contribution.  His job in RTF is the hardest, adding his own flavor to  one of the greatest musician's band in history on tunes from their classic legacy.  I hope he gets paid the most!  On first listen he fits in on every tune and then the more you listen the more you notice his flavorings on every tune.  Gambale has internalized this music and then filtered it through his own personality on guitar.  I can't wait to hear his playing on new Return to Forever music.  Lastly, the production value of this music is extremely high.  The mix of this CD places you right in the center of the stage, where you can hear the dynamic range of each instrument.  If I cannot have new music from Return to Forever this is as good as it ever will get from them.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I didn't even finish the book.  It wasn't a \\"grab you right away\\" item.  It was sad reading and the writer couldn't be more unqualified to be an author if she tried.  What woman puts herself in a position to sign a contract about eating and excercising and when to do it.  What woman wants to be hurt.  I can't imagine how a physically abused woman would view all of this if she read such stuff.  Poorly written....the author using phrases like, \\"oh my\\" when she sees him naked.  Or phrases like, \\"er\\" when the character is pondering something, instead of maybe writing it as \\"um\\".  I don't know anyone that says \\"er\\" while they are thinking of what to say.  Maybe I'll try it.  Stupid subject matter....and my sex drive is fine but not forced and I don't have to be bitten or slapped to enjoy it.  Wish I could get a refund....it was terrible.  The hype from others made me buy it.  She must have paid those women to hype the book.  Can't imagine a movie.  Didn't hold my interest.  Never will finish it....will delete it from my Kindle. Don't waste your money, just have others tell you how bad it truly was....worst book I ever bought.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have read volumes of sic fi and thrillers, but this is without a doubt one of the finest books I have ever read.  Too bad the rating system only allows for 5 stars, because I would definitely give this one 6+.<br /><br />Randy Greenhaw
B00009V7P8|5.0|I had never heard of Damien Rice until Philip Phillips sang his song Volcano on American Idol, loved the song, made me look Damien up on You Tube and fell in love with his songs.  Such emotion!! I have recommended the CD to several of my friends.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I definitely could not escape the peer pressure here, and ended up purchasing all three books.  Let's just say that no matter how bad the writing, if I start a series - I have to finish it.  I hesitated to give a bad review, knowing that the author had never written anything before, but it was just too bad.  The \\"heroine\\" (and I hesitate to call her that) was a weak, simpering, naive fool.  Apparently a lack of sexual experience means that you will orgasm at the drop of a hat, and will be willing to do anything for the person responsible for said orgasm.  The \\"hero\\" (again, seriously?) was just 50 shades of messed up - there is no way that this relationship could legitimately work in the real world.<br /><br />I can understand the appeal - I just wish that it was well written with more likeable characters.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's weight lifting for the brain!  You have to think outside the box. And it's so addictive. I play for hours without realizing it.
B00338QENI|5.0|Let me preface this by saying that I rarely, if ever read anything non-fiction.  I mainly stick towards fiction, but something about this book spoke to me.  I was completely engaged from page one, reading not only the story of Henrietta Lacks, but also the intertwined stories of Lacks' family and the author.  The author managed something that years of science-based classes never seemed to manage - she made me interested in the science of the story. A fantastic read.
0425263908|3.0|I was looking for something to read after Fifty Shades trilogy.  Yes, this is very much like it but I had a really hard time getting into it.  To me the characters were not well developed and I didn't find myself caring about them or whether they got together or not.  I really had a tough time finishing the book.
B000W93CHC|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's not quite as good as Pillars of the Earth, but Ken Follett tells a good story (if a little predictable this time around) and he makes it so fun to imagine life in old England. A great, entertaining read!
B0059XTUEK|4.0|While I really liked this film, there are a couple of glaring issues.  1.  This movie took too much of a sympathetic perspective of Marilyn Monroe.  2.  Michelle Williams is a very good actress - borderline excellent - which makes her too good to play Marilyn.  Ms. Monroe never bothered to learn her craft as an actress (watch \\"Seven Year Itch\\" if you disagree with me, or even \\"Some Like it Hot\\" where she was strictly a prop to the far superior Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis) so Ms. Williams had to downgrade her skills here, which was obviously difficult for her to do.<br /><br />Before you get too excited about negative comments about Ms. Monroe, I have read a book or two about her so I know most of the basics.  As someone in this film says to the third-string director at one point, \\"Stay away my boy.  Otherwise, you will get burned,\\" when talking about any relationship with Monroe.  Indeed.  From what I have read this was a common refrain; many men were left in her wake, to risk mixing metaphors.<br /><br />It's too bad Marilyn died so young, but not for the reasons that most people believe.  Time is unkind to everyone, and it would have been particularly unkind to her.  People would have gotten the opportunity to see the real Marilyn Monroe, and I don't believe that they would have necessarily liked what they saw.  The rose-colored glasses surely would have fallen off.<br /><br />Naturally, a terrific performance here by Ms. Williams, nonetheless.  And a very good movie in the sense that it wasn't afraid to have most of the movie set around Ms. Monroe's work, and those that strongly disliked here.  A fairly strong recommendation here by me.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I had to try this book because \\"everyone\\" is reading it. It was terrible - incredibly predictable story - it read like something out of Playboy. Even for a summer read, there's too much nothing in it.
0345803485|2.0|Enter girl: self doubting, pretty (but doesn't think so), awkward, prefers sneakers and jeans, quiet, completely virginal in the world of love (in all it's forms), completely oblivious to men falling all over her<br /><br />Enter boy: smoldering eyes that hypnotize, incredible looks (un human almost), has a way of comm...unicating that takes you by surprise, moody, wealthy, dark and mysterious, plays piano, overly protective<br /><br />Plot centers around girl joining boy in boy's world that is completely foreign to her--scary, intimidating, and dark.<br /><br />Does this sound like another extremely popular book series??? hmmmmm, gee, let me think....oh yeah, it's Twilight gone kinky!!!  Or attempted kink, I should say, because I don't really think it succeeds in that.  From the way everyone was talking, I expected alot more erotic scenes.<br /><br />I also felt like this book was written for the same audience as Twilight...seemingly young women.  In which case, the book seemed like it had too much kink.  I don't have children, but I don't feel like teenagers should be reading this.  It was a little confusing with all the \\"oh crap\\" \\"double crap\\" \\"oh my\\".  Again, I felt like that level of writing was relating to young women where the subject of dom and sub should most def not be.<br /><br />Lastly, seriously, how hypersensitive is this chic???  I feel like she might need medical attention because i've never heard of someone who climaxes as easily, quickly and esplosively (every time) as she does.  Yes books are supposed to be fictional...but this was too much for me.<br /><br />Needless to say, book 1 left me in the \\"grey\\" area so to speak...
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Fifty Shades of Grey was absolute drivel. It wasn't the erotica that I minded but it should come with a black box warning: Absolutely no storyline or plot whatsoever.<br />It's a story that has been written thousands of times and this is  a sad mimicry of even those cheap dimestore love stories. As ridiculous as they are those boy meets girl novels at least  attempt to have some kind of storyline.<br />This is one of the very few books in my life that I have started and did not finish.<br />I definitly would not recommend this horrific novel.
0393964582|5.0|Probably no novel in history has been as misrepresented in film and popular culture as Frankenstein.  If you have never read it, then the most important thing to understand is that Frankenstein is *not* the story of a crazed monster let loose by an evil genius scientist.  Frankenstein is not even a horror story, if by \\"horror\\" you mean a story intended simply to scare and frighten.  Frankenstein *is* a thought provoking and heart breaking psychological tale.  Imagine: Suppose that a sentient and otherwise intelligent being, with the knowledge and experience of a newborn, were let loose in the world, with no one to teach or guide him.  What would he do?  What would his perception of reality be?  How would he feel?  How would the people around him react?  My sister urged me to read this book after she read it for a college course, and now I am urging you to read it too.  After reading it, you will never again refer to Dr. Frankenstein's creation as a \\"monster.\\"

B000SEGUDE|2.0|This is a bizarre book which I could not recommend to anyone.  I wish my local library had carried it so I wouldn't have wasted the money that I spent.  There are some good parts but few and far between.  I read it so that I would understand the upcoming movie.  I think I will need the movie to help me understand the book.
0545265355|5.0|This is exactly as described! The Hunger Games trilogy brand new. Also a very reasonable price! If you want the trilogy I would get it here!
0345803485|1.0|If I could have I would not have given it any stars. I am really surprised at the reviews. These books are sooo poorly written almost like a horny teenager wrote them. Only reason I kept reading was because I didn't want to waste my money and really hope it would get better. Sadly it do not and I was forced to skip over several pages just so i could end my disappointment and the books.  The sex scenes were ok but same over, and over and over again got old fast. As for the characters they were not relatable, and I felt nothing for them. No substance to these books , only thing i enjoyed was when the series ended. So now i am wondering who is really reading these books...is it really 30 something's?? How hard up can we be to put this on the top sellers listing??? I have read better stuff in playboy then these books.
B000FCKGPC|1.0|I devoured the first three books in this series and loved every minute of it!  Primed for the next installment, I downloaded A Feast for Crows, only to find that almost none of my favorite characters get more than a mention, and none of them their own chapters.  I was getting used to GRRM wontonly killing off my favorite characters, to the point where it is becomming cliche; now when he gets sick of writing about a character, he just ignores them and writes about some other insignificant character.  The story line is plodding along at this point, and I have frankly lost interest.  I forced myself to keep reading for a while, hoping it would pick up again, but it is becomming too much of a chore, so I fear I will never finish this series and get closure on what began as an enthralling story.  I get more enjoyment from reading my textbooks these days.  I wonder if there is a Cliff Note for this book?  Reader's Digest could probably cover the important points of it in two pages.  I hate to say it, but The Others take the rest of this series.
034580404X|1.0|Worst books ever, hard to believe its soo popular. Do not believe the hype you will only be let down like I was. I wasted my time reading the whole dang series thinking it had to get better. It did not, in fact it got worse and I skipped several pages. I didn't have issues with the sex in this book or how grahpic it sometimes was. My issue was the 2 main characters---she was weak, never having a backbone and he had issues. Ana was not endearing or relatable I found her annoying and was in fact mad that she was such a weak person. I did like one part of the books and that was the end.
B0085Z3B2Q|2.0|This review is not about the movie, but about Universal's digital copy practices.  My copy of The Lorax arrived, with promise of both Ultra Violet AND digital copy.  The instructions to download to my iTunes send me to UniversalDigitalCopy.com/TheLorax.  However, there is no such site. So where, pray tell, should I go to redeem my copy?  I have searched related sites--nothing.  Except they would cheerfully sell me a download for $4.95.  Not feeling like paying again!
B001NLKT60|4.0|It was still a strong story. However, simply put it was AT LEAST 250 pages too long--AT LEAST. The beginning of this book grips you as we watch Lisbeth Salander weather a tropical storm and save the life of another helpless woman.  I could call that part unnecessary and expositional but the entire part effectively endears us to Lisbeth Salander. She IS the allure of these books. Period. And so by the middle of the book, as soon as the journalists are murdered, we lose sight of her for pages and pages and PAGES! And I grew more and more and MORE frustrated by the endless tail-chasing by the police and the other journalists. And the repetitive dialog of the details. Because I knew the entire time that Mikael and Lisbeth were going to solve the murders anyway!!! Not the police! That's how these stories go. The antag and protag solves the case! So why in the world do what to read through all of that blabbering???? Then to make it worse we, the readers, learned early one who killed them all anyway! It was just exhausting, BUT...<br /><br />I don't know. I give it 4 stars instead of 3 because, even with the dense and repetitive quality of the prose, Larsson has created a masterpiece when he created Lisbeth Salander, and that is not easy to do. And, furthermore, I couldn't sleep. I had to keep reading through the tail-chasing until Lisbeth reappeared. Then, once she showed up, I couldn't get enough! Ended up going to bed at 5:30AM and finishing today! Now that's the reason why readers are always on the search for a good book. The, \\"I can't put it down\\" high. The fact that I had to speed read/self edit through the bulk of it, took it from a 5 to a 4 star.<br /><br />I would say, to those who are considering this series that it's totally worth getting to know Lisbeth Salander.<br /><br />But I don't know if I have the energy to get through the third book; I'm still assessing myself--I'll know soon.
B008BM9L72|2.0|this is not as good as i imagained it to be. the sex was so unrealistic and did not get my juices flowing at all. I would not recommend anyone to buy it, and in fact have told people not too
1401937519|5.0|Five stars for Anita Moorjani's testimony of her NDE. If you are considering buying this book, but are wondering whether or not Moorjani as a writer can tell the tale of her NDE, the answer is absolutely yes. Readers are in for an amazing story of her life, her NDE, and the miraculous healing that took place in her cancer riddled body. I found her uncomplicated take-home message of simply love yourself more, and enjoy your life more fearlessly, to be such a relief.  It's not hard to remember that simple message, which fits perfectly into Jesus' admonition to do unto others as you would have others do unto you.  If you read the bible, you know that the message \\"do not be afraid\\" occurs throughout. Therefore, it's not surprising that this is one of the main messages she carries back from her NDE.  It seems to be an important one for our human experience. I especially enjoyed her perspective on our consciousness, and how it expands in the afterlife, but is limited by our senses and the linear aspect of time when we are in our human form.<br /><br />If you read \\"Heaven is for Real\\" and thought it was hogwash, then read this instead. It's not filtered through the fundamentalist's view of the afterlife, or retro-fitted to match Bible verses, or \\"recalled\\" in bits and pieces over years.  She had a NDE, she woke up, and she was changed.  Her experience is our gain.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I thought the book was kind of fun.  It was a bit redundant.  It was interresting enough that I will probably read the next in the series.  A friend of mine suggested taking a break between the books, because the author is very repeditive with wording. Reading them in quick succession is not as enjoyable, as she was just wanting to get through the last book.  I can totally see that, and will take her advice. Sometimes I struggled to care about the characters.  I have heard the 2nd and 3rd books are a little better, so I will check them out.

B0059XTTW8|2.0|This well-publicized movie features a lot of first rate talent in front of the camera and expansive sets but they scrimped on a script and did many of the actors no favors in direction and casting. The script is unclear in many places, no doubt trimmed to fit within a reasonable feature length but the material needs more time. This trimming reduces many fine actors to almost walk-on parts and denies them the opportunity to define their characters. Esterhazy and Bland are two examples. They are almost cyphers here. And Bill Haydon(Colin Firth) is given no chance to give his motivation for his actions. There is some serious miscasting too. Ciarin Hinds should be Percy Alliline not the shorty featured. Political correctness also raises its ugly head here. Peter Guilam is a homosexual here while in the book and 1979 version he is a ladies man. This was completely unnecessary, which is strange since so many explanatory material was excised elsewhere. This movie is is one more proof that remakes are a bad idea. The 1979 TV version is massively better in just about every way.

B0071XO8RA|3.0|Not the worst sci-fi I've read, certainly not the best.  It begins well, then becomes tedious and overblown.  Too much concentration on unimportant details, too little on important themes.  How did the original society come to the rather Jehovan conclusion that it had to destroy mankind to save it?  Religious psychosis?  A charismatic madman?  I guess we'll never know, and really, I don't much care.

0439023513|4.0|This was a great ending to the series but I felt like it was a little elongated. It took me a while to get through this book because it didn't hold my attention. I eventually started reading it again because I simply wanted to know what happened. The events in this novel are unexpected and it comes with many twists and turns which made it a page turner. I agree with some other reviews that it isn't the best book out of the three but it is still a good ending the the series. I love the themes in this novel and all of the novels. Yes, these are drastically fictional novels but where are many similarities to the way our society is today. I will not spoil what happens at the end but I would have preferred Katniss to be with the other one.

The ending, which of course, was an absolute blessing, was a complete disappointment as well!  And because I had invested so much time in this book, I was reluctant to completely chuck it.  Big mistake!

I can't get to them and they cannot get to me.  It has been infuriating.  No one has an answer to the problem so I have uninstalled the game from my KindleFire.  The response everyone keeps getting is \\"they are not accepting games from me right now\\"<br />After searching online for days it seems this has become a common problem.  Why can't they just leave well enough alone?  Amazon needs to pull this app until they get it fixed.

B000MQC9H4|5.0|I saw this movie and immediately related to both characters actually.  I'm not a fan of Cameron Diaz or Jude Law, but they were both very likable in this movie, in fact they were great. I found myself rooting for them.<br /><br />Kate Winslet is perfect as usual, delivering a solid and pleasant performance, she proves that she is more than a serious actress, she can be funny and relaxed.  Before I saw the movie, I thought Jack Black didn't quite fit with the cast, but he is adorable in this.  He is perfect in his role and I can't imagine the movie without him.<br /><br />The set design will leave your eyes hungry for more, it's beautifully done. I don't want to give too much of the movie away, but I loved this love story of four people coming together unexpectedly and finding the love they truly deserve.<br /><br />Bravo to Writer/Director Nancy Meyers!

B0083KBM2Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and hope to see more of Puller. Who, by the way, is not a Reacer clone and personally didn't fund anything close to the Affair. I have read all books by both authors and don't get some of these reviews. But then I am partial to RANGERS especially 3rd Bat. Read it, enjoy it, I did.
B0001NBMEE|4.0|The 1954 version of \\"Prince Valiant\\" is one of my all-time favorite movies.  Of course, it's not historically accurate, Vikings did not wear horns in their helmets and if \\"King Arthur\\" existed at all he was a 5th century Roman-Celtic chieftain without 14th century armor and elaborate castles.  Arthur was  fighting off Angle, Saxon and Jute invaders from northern Germany and southern Denmark, not Vikings.  The Vikings didn't start raiding England until the late 8th century CE.<br /><br />That being said, I'm glad there were changes made in the movie that did upset some purist \\"Prince Valiant\\" comics fans.  I'm glad Prince Valiant's homeland was changed from \\"Thule\\" to \\"Scandia\\" which was an actual region in southern Sweden.  Also having his mother still living was a plus.<br /><br />Victor McLaughlin was magnificent as the Viking friend to Prince Valiant (Boltar).  And the music by Franz Waxman is perhaps the best musical score ever used in a medieval movie.  My favorite part of the epic was the battle of Scandia at the end where the Christian Vikings attack Sligon's pagan stronghold to free Prince Valiant and his family and restore the Christian faith.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this movie four stars instead of five, was because of the jump the movie makes after Sligon is overthrown, the movie suddenly shifts back to Camelot.  There is no interim to celebrate Aguar's restoration as king of Scandia and Prince Valiant suddenly appears in King Arthur's court clothed in a knight's wardrobe wanting to fight Sir Brack.  I had hoped that maybe the DVD had contained some lost scenes that had never made it to TV, but unfortunately I was wrong.<br /><br />But still, I recommend this great movie to all ages.  And by all means, please avoid the wretched 1996 version of \\"Prince Valiant.\\"  It's an insult to the original movie.
030758836X|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, I actually couldn't put it down, but the ending was so disappointing! Talk about blah - it's interesting that with all the good twists and turns the writer chose such an unsatisfactory ending.
0143121006|5.0|Wow, a really good read of a true story whodunnit.  Other reviews provide a synopsis of the murder mystery itself.  I particularly enjoyed that it reads like a well written novel but is actually a well researched documentary of the murder itself and the turbulent times in Peking. Paul French first ran across Pamela Werner, the murder victim, as a footnote in Edgar Snow's \\"Red Star Over China\\".  From there he spent seven years researching the story and writing this book.  The murder mystery itself is intriguing, but I was equally interested to read what it was like to live in the last days of colonial Peking as it evolved from days of warlords to internal civil war to occupation by Japan.

If then it be profitable for him to read, why should it not at least be tolerable and free for his adversary to write? In logic they teach that contraries laid together, more evidently appear; it follows then, that all controversy being permitted, falsehood will appear more false, and truth the more true; which must needs conduce much to the general confirmation of an implicit truth.<br />- John Milton<br /><br />Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code has sold over 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a major motion picture catapulted into the stratosphere largely by controversy that it probably doesn't deserve, not because it is a literary masterpiece. The Da Vinci Code is at best a mystery potboiler that has sold 6-10 times the number of copies it would have without the attending controversy, controversy that largely amounts to a tempest in a teapot. Only the threatened would stir up this amount of controversy over this novel. Unfortunately, the groups stirring up the greatest controversy are the least threatened by this novel.<br /><br />The controversy surrounding the novel focuses on certain assertions of the novelist regarding the historical and doctrinal evidence in the Bible and certain non-canonical works regarding the supposed marriage of Jesus to Mary Magdalene and their subsequent offspring, a daughter named Sarah who supposedly married European royalty founding the Merovingian line of kings. This evidence, according to Brown and others, has been suppressed by the Catholic Church and preserved by a secret society known as the Priory of Sion. In The Da Vinci Code this conflict is played out as a mystery chase to find the resting place of the Holy Grail, supposedly the tomb of Mary Magdalene, between the inheritor of the Priory's keystone and agents of the secretive Catholic sect, Opus Dei.<br /><br />Like all good fiction, The Da Vinci Code speculates \\"what if these things were true?\\" Unfortunately, for anyone attempting to seek truth within its pages, one must willingly suspend one's disbelief and accept a series of half-truths and untruths. There is nothing wrong with this, for the duration of participating in the drama of the novel. The highly educated see this as nothing more than dramatic license for the sake of telling the story. I am reminded of one of my favorite statements from Friedrich Schiller in defense of his ahistorical Maria Stuart which paraphrased is, \\"The artist has no obligation to history.\\"<br /><br />Where we run into difficulty with this novel is that certain elements, for whatever spectacular publicity reason, have chosen to forward the fictional propositions of the novel as truth. The result has been the inevitable cottage industry of debunking the text, in itself another 60 million + in unit sales industry because the 60 millionwho bought The Da Vinci Code are mostly truthseekers who have purchased the accompanying debunking texts in order to understand why they are reviled in church circles for reading this novel.<br /><br />There are five points of controversy I would like to deal with in this review: the divinity of Jesus, the humanity of Jesus, the marriage of Jesus to Mary, the Priory of Sion versus Opus Dei, and the question of whether or not the Catholic Church would ever kill to keep a secret.<br /><br />First, there is the question of the divinity of Jesus. All Christians are taught that Jesus was one person with two natures; one divine, and one human. The canonical, deuterocanonical and pseudipigriphal texts all confirm that Jesus was at once both fully human and fully divine. Brown, and others, assert that Jesus' divinity was the result of a vote at the First Council of Nicea, \\"and a close one at that,\\" according to Da Vinci Code protagonist, Robert Langdon. I searched everywhere for evidence that Jesus' divinity ever actually came up for a vote at said council and had difficulty finding it. The only reference I could find was a quotation from Karen King, a history professor at Harvard Divinity School, in a National Geographic article in which she stated that Jesus' divinity was voted upon, but was carried almost unanimously (300-2). (For the full text of this article go here: [...])<br /><br />Now, I'm not certain what the actual proposition on the table was, but I have a feeling that it was more a vote to confirm and publicly proclaim the divinity of Jesus. From the comfort of our 21st Century American viewpoint where religious belief and expression are Constitutionally protected, this seems absurd. However, in the 4th Century, there was no protection against persecution for heretical religious beliefs. It would have required a vote by a council of bishops to allow people to publicly proclaim something they have always believed. The followers of Jesus, while believing in Jesus' divinity, would have shied away from publicly proclaiming this in the Roman Empire. Under Roman law at the time, only the Emperor could be proclaimed divine.<br /><br />Despite Emperor Constantine's conversion to Christianity, he was still the emperor and intended to stay the emperor. As emperor, Constantine was a politician and a good one at that. Constantine saw the growing number of Christians in his empire and knew that courting them would help to solidify his power base. However, the winds of politics shift rapidly and if Constantine had sensed a shift from Christianity back to paganism, one wonders if he would have shifted with that wind. For the Council of Nicea to publicly proclaim the divinity of Jesus required Constantine to willingly accept his own non-divinity. This was a very risky move for the Council. One that could have backfired on them had there ever been a political shift by future emperors away from Christianity. While Christians had always believed in the divinity of Jesus, in most parts of the world, they were not permitted to publicly proclaim it because the laws of the lands forbade it. This is a significant religious and political paradigm shift.<br /><br />Next, there is the question of the humanity of Jesus. Early Christians had no difficulty comprehending and accepting the human nature of Jesus. They were so close to the source that they knew it almost instinctively, much the way we Americans comprehend and accept the human natures of the founding fathers of the United States. How will those founding fathers be deified 2000 years into the future? Will Thomas Jefferson and George Washington become the Romulus and Remus of American Rome, suckled at the teats of a bald eagle? It is hard to say. It is modern Christians who are squeamish about a human Jesus. While we understand the dual nature of humanity (one creature with two natures, one spiritual, one animal) we cannot stomach the thought of a savior with that nature. We want our Jesusresurrected and spiritual, not alive and animal, mucking around in the miasma of humanity. A human Jesus is not clean, not transcendent, not saintly. Modern Christians cannot stomach the living, breathing, sweating, eating, drinking, burping, farting, urinating, defecating Jesus.<br /><br />It is this very humanity that drives the action of The Da Vinci Code. God sent Jesus to Earth to experience the full range of human experience before accepting Him as the ultimate sacrifice for all of human sin.<br /><br />Third, there is the question of Jesus' supposed marriage to Mary Magdalene. Why shouldn't He have married and fathered children? It seems reasonable to assume that He would do so. He was a rabbi and taught in the synagogue. An unmarried, 30-something rabbi would have been highly unusual in those days. Certainly not unheard of, but certainly uncommon. So it seems reasonable to assume that Jesus might have been married. We only have the absence of mention of His marriage in the gospels and Paul's assertion that He was not married on which to base the assumption that Jesus was a lifelong bachelor. Any historian will tell you that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Therefore, it is possible that Jesus was married.<br /><br />I have heard this forwarded by professors of divinity and theologians on numerous History Channel specials. But every one of them shied away from asserting Jesus' marriage as a fact. Each one suggested that it was possible. My experience watching Mythbusters proves that possible doesn't mean probable and probable doesn't mean actual. Harvard historian Karen King, in the same National Geographic article, states that if Jesus and Mary were married it is more unusual for them to be spoken of together so often in the gospels without mentioning that fact. Conspiracy theorists, of course, will point to the expurgation of these references by the early Catholic church. However, the Dead Sea Scrolls, Qumran Scrolls and Nag Hamadi parchments, while bringing to light some long-forgotten texts, did more to confirm the authenticity of the canonical works of the Bible than to refute them.<br /><br />If Jesus were married, it likely was not to Mary Magdalene, although it is highly likely that Mary and Jesus were much closer than we like to believe and Mary has been much maligned throughout history by patriarchal church leaders with an ax to grind with their own contemporary women.<br /><br />The novel makes a great deal out of a supposed pagan sex ritual known as the heiros gamos in which the high priest and high priestess of the sect copulate while surrounded by their chanting followers. I searched for this online, where it should be easy to find references to alternative sexual and religious practices, and found only a reference in the sacraments of the Ecclesiastica Gnostica, the governing body of the modern Gnostic Christian sect. According to their website, heiros gamos is the Sacrament of the Bridechamber. Essentially, we Christians know this as the heavenly time when Christ (the Spirit) is reunited with His Church (the Bride). Ecclesiastica Gnostica claims that there is no earthly performance of this sacrament as it can only be achieved after Christ's return. According to their website, the earthly substitute is the sacrament of marriage, supposedly the only way that humans can experience this spiritually significant sacrament while on earth is through marriage. Well, that sort of takes the excitement out of that ritual, now doesn't it? In fact, the characters Brown has performing this ceremony in the novel turn out to be husband and wife anyway.<br /><br />Next, there is the question of the Priory of Sion and the supposed rivalry with Opus Dei. The Priory of Sion is a real organization with a bogus history. The Priory was founded in 1956 by Pierre Plantard, a confidence man, who wished to place a claim on the royal throne of France should it ever be reinstated. To do so, he had to falsify historicaldocuments that gave the Priory an ancient history with celebrated Grandmasters who were sworn to protect the secret of the royal bloodline descended from antiquity through the Merovingian kings. Les dossiers secrets were deposited by Plantard and his compatriots in the Biblioth&egrave;que nationale de France in the 1960s so that anyone researching the Priory would come across them. The documents were fake and have been soundly debunked for over 30 years. (see the Wikipedia entry at [...] for more information)<br /><br />Dan Brown could have gotten himself out of a whole lot of scandal and controversy had he simply acknowledged that he exercised dramatic license by playing fast and loose with these documents. But he did not and it catapulted an okay novel into a blockbuster. I guess any publicity is good publicity.<br /><br />Opus Dei is also a real organization. I have not taken the time to research them and I do not know enough about them to speak freely about them. All I will say is this, when you shroud yourself in secrecy, you open yourself up to all kinds of conspiracy theories. Opus Dei would do well for itself if it opened up all of its documents for transparent scrutiny to the public. The Catholic church in the United States has not fared well in the last several years what with hidden transfers of priests accused of sexual misconduct only to be permitted to continue their abuses in new parishes. Secrecy lends itself to the suspicion that drives the action of The Da Vinci Code.<br /><br />Last, there is the question of whether the Catholic church would ever resort to murder to keep embarrassing secrets hidden. This question is central to both The Da Vinci Code and its predecessor, Angels and Demons. The short answer is this: any time religion and politics combine an inflammatory mixture is created. Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. I will simply assert that to deny that the Catholic Church was once capable of murder is to deny that the Spanish Inquisition ever happened. But it did, and the Middle Eastern morass that we find ourselves embroiled in today is a residual effect of that very attempt at genocide at the behest of the Vatican.<br /><br />The legends surrounding the demise of the Knights Templar in 1307 are the starting point for The Da Vinci Code. According to history, King Philip IV of France prevailed upon Pope Clement V to round up, torture and execute all members of the Knights Templar for acts of heresy. According to legend, some members escaped the pogrom, gathered the bulk of the Templar treasure and spirited it off to Scotland where they formed the Scottish Rite Freemasons who supposedly guard the treasure of the Temple of Solomon to this day.<br /><br />Since we are dealing with politics, it is more likely that the truth is less spectacular than the trumped up charges of heresy or the heroic legends. Philip IV inherited a poverty-stricken nearly bankrupted France. He needed money for the treasury. The Knights Templar were a wealthy, militarized order protected by the Pope and represented a threat to Philip. Upon the death of Pope Benedict XI, a year passed before a new pope was elected because of disputes between French and Italian cardinals. Pope Clement V, a Frenchman born Bertrand de Goth and a childhood friend of Philip IV, was elected to the papacy. Clement was widely known as a pawn of Philip and the two succeeded in diminishing the power of the papacy over Europe. One can deduce from these facts that Philip IV was threatened by the Knights Templar whose wealth he coveted, so he manipulated the election of Pope Clement V in order to legally overthrow them and claim their treasure for his own coffers. Nothing more than simple political corruption.<br /><br />I need not belabor any other points of controversy in The Da Vinci Code because this is a book of fiction, not a journalistic account. The suspect nature of continuing to support the Priory of Sion as a true ancient organization in the face of facts that prove its bogus nature, throws any other spurious claims in the novel into serious doubt. Now to the actual review of the novel.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code is a spectacular textbook example of great plotting. It moves quickly through the action of the mystery. It is tightly plotted with short chapters that drive the action rapidly forward and a search for a secret that the reader is asked to participate in with brief explanations of the necessary skills to achieve this goal. It is a brilliant example of Aristotelian Poetics. Brown observes all the rules of unity of place, time and action. It should be read as an example of perfect plotting by beginning writing students. Theoretically, this novel should translate perfectly into a movie. It is also highly addictive brain candy.<br /><br />Before I began reading the novel I was already acutely aware of the bogus nature of the Priory of Sion, so I absolutely had to suspend my disbelief in order to accept the action. I was unable to put the book down once I got to the last 150 pages. The pace had quickened so greatly and I was able to solve the final three puzzles pages before Brown revealed their solution so I was not inclined to put the book down until I had finished it.<br /><br />The ending, however, left me nonplussed. I had read every page expecting something more spectacular, only to find it nothing more than a near deus ex machina ending lifted from the ancient Greek story of Orestes and Electra.<br /><br />As for characterization, Brown is no master of subtleties. His characters are largely ciphers, two-dimensional caricatures of their basic functions: the chief inspector, the cryptologist, the curator, the art historian, the banker, the professor, etc. They are broadly drawn with few shading strokes. His women are always exceptionally gorgeous and as author he states that Langdon is always surprised by how intelligent they are. Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code are both largely adventure fantasies of the lonely bachelor college professor plunged into a mystery beyond his abilities to solve, but who somehow manages to bring his intellect to bear in order to solve it. This book should not, however, be read as an example of sophisticated characterization.<br /><br />Dan Brown is reported to have begun his writing career in an attempt to do a better job of writing a thriller than Sydney Sheldon. While I was enthralled by Brown's action, I was less than thrilled by his characters and his faulty scholarship. I am reminded of a statement a friend of mine used to make when referring to plays with splashy high entertainment values and little thematic substance. She would say they were \\"all sizzle and no steak.\\"<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code is all sizzle and no steak, empty carbohydrate brain candy and the literary equivalent of professional wrestling and should be accorded the same amount of controversy as that \\"venerable sport.\\" It is not clear whether The Da Vinci Code generated controversy because of its phenomenal sales or generated its phenomenal sales because of its controversy, but it is clear that it is nothing more than a novel that is speculative, owes nothing to history and requires great suspension of disbelief for its dramatic license to be accepted. It poses no threat to the church except that it requires the church to do a better job of deciding which battles to fight and which ones to ignore.married, it likely was not to Mary Magdalene, although it is highly likely that Mary and Jesus were much closer than we like to believe and Mary has been much maligned throughout history by patriarchal church leaders with an ax to grind with their own contemporary women.

The photography in the book is glorious.  There are very few interviews with the actors and<br />not a word from Maggie Smith who is the spice of the show.  The book is interesting.  It does explain just how the series<br />was developed but not how the actors were cast.  There is a brief explaination of how Highclere Castle was chosen and how<br />the sets in London were built, furnished and some of the technical problems of shooting in multiple locations.  The section<br />on the war scenes is very interesting and shows how much investigation has gone into making everything authentic.  Explaining<br />how the dresses were made is also quite well done, however I would have enjoyed more information on just how the work is shot,<br />more interviews with the actors and more information about the set construction and decoration.  If you want a picture book,<br />buy this one.  If you want information, pass.

B002JOUNDY|5.0|5 Stars = Masterpiece<br /><br />Much like \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula (Coppola produced), here is a stylish, beautifully filmed, & acted update of a classic story. Some people fault Kenneth Branagh for his hyper dramatics, both in the direction, editing, & his acting in this film. I say it was just terrific! Here is a man so obsessed by his mother's death, that he wants nothing less than to bring an end to death! His whirlwind performance is hypnotizing! A man so possessed by his vision, that it would eventually destroy everyone around him he loves & eventually himself. The most extreme case of irony, of a man who wanted to give life, but in the end brought nothing but death.<br /><br />Robert De Niro. What can I say about his performance as the monster? Not since Boris Karloff's great portrayal, have I seen such pathos, love, & and anger in Frankstein's creation. His interpretation should of at least won him an Oscar nomination. Nothing short of brilliant!<br /><br />\\"Mary Shelly's Frankenstein\\" is a film filled with a tornadic vortex of emotions, actions, & circumstance. It is a film that can sweep the viewer in to it's catapulting crescendos & crashes. An emotional roller coaster ride to one man's oblivion. Profoundly sad, but also, profoundly mesmerizing! Only \\"the Bride of Frankenstein\\" matches this film in importance, as a truly transcending film from a classic story, of one man's madness.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Without anyone else to share his feelings with Charlie writes to \\"Dear Friend\\", an address out of the phone book.<br />Though \\"Dear Friend\\" never responds Charlie is comfortable with growing up as a bright student who is considered a weirdo by his peer group until popular senior siblings take him under their wing. Funny, poignant, well written! A must read for all generations.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I loved this whole series. I really enjoyed the movies but I don't like all the hoopla that goes along with actors. I don't care about their personal lives, acting is their job. Sometimes I wish that great book series weren't made into movies so I could just keep my version of this story in my imagination. My gorgeous guy isn't what they cast. So that being said, and me going off course, I loved the book.
B004H0M8EA|4.0|This book contained too much information to even ry to summarize in a review, so I'm not even going to try. Instead, I have very little to say about this book overall. My favorite chapters had to be the one's about the past socities (mostly, no doubt, due to my love of history). I was surprised to not love the chapters about Norse Greenland. I think that is becasue I already knew so much of it already (like Renee didn't love the chapter about the Maya b/c she knew it all, told you I jinxed myself, Renee!). My favorite chapter out of all of them had to be the one about Easter Island, followed by the chapter about Pitcairn and Henderson Islands (the chapter was titled \\"The Last People Alive\\", which gives a stark image of a person all alone on a island just waiting to die). Aside from the history chapters in general, I also found the chapter about big business to be interesting.<br /><br />I might come back later and write a epic review, since I really did take notes over this book (I really did! Some of them might even be useful for a review!) but I hate writing long reviews and the internet is still acting odd, so no promises! I'm hoping to at least write a longer review, but I don't know what else to say, so this is it.
B00004YTIQ|4.0|My pool cover didn't come with any instructions but I am guessing it was supposed to. It came with the large plastic cover and one really long piece of string that is used to tie it down. I don't know if I cut the string the way it was meant to go but it works fine. The pool cover stays in place well considering it is really windy where I live. It doesnt keep everything out but probably 95% so it is still worth it. I didn't have the problem with bugs that others mentioned but I live in a dry climate so that might help. I was just glad that there is something to cover this size pool (the cover size is perfect for the size listed in the description) because it takes forever to fill. It is nice to not have to refill it all the time and is worth the price.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Yes, there's a lot of hype surrounding these books. No,they're not perfect. But they are wonderful love stories filled with passion. I couldn't put them down and read all three in a week. They're not literary genius, but there is something magical about them. Ignore the hype and don't read thinking they're going to be Booker prize winners. But keep an open mind and heart and they may captivate you like they captivated me.

But I gave it three stars because this book showed me that you can make your own<br />system in order to memorize anything(I used to think it had to be inborn).

0547564651|5.0|Why do some children succeed in life and others do not?  Why does a bright child end up a failure as an adult while a more average student ends up a success?  Paul Tough says that the answer is character.  Traits like self-control, diligence, and perseverance are better predictors of success in life than IQ.  In fact, those who are especially bright, may be set up for failure as they become used to everything in school coming easily to them, and are ill-prepared for the difficulties of the \\"real world.\\"<br /><br />I found the book absolutely fascinating, both informative and enjoyable to read.  The book is full of research and example to make the author's point.  It does a wonderful job demonstrating that character does matter and is as essential for a child to learn as any academic subject.  This is not, however, a how-to book that goes into great detail about how to instill these traits in your children/students.<br /><br />One of the groups that the author focuses on significantly is those of low socioeconomic status.  He makes the case, convincingly, that the main problem that they have to overcome is the stressful circumstances of their childhood, such as violence, broken homes, etc.  Most find themselves significantly impaired by the constant strain of their early environment.  Yet those with close supportive relationships with their caregiver(s) and the opportunity to develop key character traits are able to rise above their circumstances.<br /><br />The author also focuses on a low-income school in NYC that produces champion chess teams.  Children who manage to apply themselves and become national masters are obviously bright.  And yet it doesn't translate into test scores, which show them to be woefully behind their peers.  I was saddened to see the national master in middle school who couldn't locate entire continents on a map or name a single European country.  I felt that child was cheated by the hours a day spent on chess that could have been spent helping him to gain a basic education so that he can function in the world post-graduation.  Still, the fact that someone so disadvantaged could achieve so much in one arena, shows what perseverance and diligence can reap.<br /><br />Overall, this is an interesting book that makes a very good case that it is absolutely critical for children to develop character traits like curiosity, perseverance, etc.  It's fascinating reading, even if I already agreed with that conclusion.  Just don't expect a how-to book with 5 key steps to implement in your classroom or home.

0061452068|5.0|In a world replete with doomsday theorists who predict that the quality of life for humans will get worse, here comes HOPE with historical evidence! Ridley has produced the most powerful argument yet for the case that the quality of life will only get better, and that the best is yet to come. What his book The Red Queen[...] did for our understanding of human attraction, this book will do to our understanding of markets.
030758836X|4.0|Maybe I missed something, but I actually liked the ending. I didn't like the first quarter of the book. I thought that it was very boring. I continued reading just expecting for it to get good and boy did it. By the middle I was internally imploding by the creativity and psychology of it all.<br /><br />*******************Possible SPOILERS Below **************************<br /><br />The ending however, I could see why people would not like it. I too, usually like a happy or contented ending. I think it is human nature for us to desire satisfying closure and always hoping that somehow justice can come in some form, especially because in the real world we are surrounded so often by sad or unfulfilled endings. That being said, I think the end fits very nicely to the overall feel of the book and for it to all of a sudden be some sort of good ending would have also either made people furious or said it was also unbelievable. I don't really believe anyone deserved a happy ending for various reasons.<br /> I think in the end they both got what they deserved. I felt it showed an incredible character arch in Nick, even if that doesn't include the development of a moral compass. I did feel like He became alive where he seemed dead before. I believe that Amy's parents are to blame for much of her psychosis and although of course, I didn't agree with what she did, I felt the realism and I understood how it could be logical thought patterns and actions for her given her identity crisis and internal conflict. Paranoid schizophrenic, anybody???<br /><br />I felt pity for both and really Nick did come out on top. She wanted everything to go back to normal and for him to love her again... and he wont and never will and in the end he lets her know that now she has to live in this personality she has created for herself and can never be who she really is which is what she has ultimately desired her entire life. She wanted to control herself and her circumstances (because she felt shenever could due to her life always playing out in the AA books) and in reality created a cell of a life she would be confined to. Notice how she couldn't even live in the real world for a short time before she NEEEEDED to go back.<br /><br />I felt it was completely in character for her to have the last say in the book. Its interesting because we all know that when someone acts like that in an argument (and I felt like that's what this book was, one big long argument) they are actually in the wrong and its the one who is calm and rational who is more mature. He took the higher road and she had not changed, in fact she signed her own death warrant with the pregnancy and lost any control she might have ever had on her own life. It showcased just how trapped she is in her own morality game. She just had to have the last word but it doesn't mean anything and she still lost the game/herself.<br /><br />The last blurb really highlights just how completely gone this girl really is.

B0081KTI0E|2.0|I found this movie to be odd and very disappointing. Not scary at all and the story was just plain.
014241493X|5.0|This story is one of the view that captivated me for showing how we think we know people so well but really do not; whether it is due to a lack of paying attention or the shell everyone now seems to put themselves in. It shows how truly connecting with someone is hard and takes much time and attention.<br />At the beginning Q is just a love sick teenager who experiences the best night of, what has mostly been, an uneventful life. As the story unravels, Q learns that the real Margo was nothing like the persona she put on in school. Undeniably, finding Robert Joyner dead at the age of nine definitely affected her more than anyone had known. In many ways, surrounding herself with superficial friends and having a stereotypical boyfriend, was just a shell to protect who she really was and wanted to be (even though she probably didn't know who that person was or is). By rifling through clues, both intentional and unintentional, that Margo left; Q discovers that her attitude towards life is contradictory and complex. Clues of travel brochures and magazines showed a person wanting to take on the world and participate, while the locations Margo stayed at where devoid of life and desolate. I believe Margo never really knew what it was like to care for someone or try to understand someone else until in the end when she realized how much Q actually cared about her. It is ironic that,throughout the novel,everything pointed to an adventurous girl who wanted to do as much with her life as possible, but in the end is choosing to shut herself off from society and the world by living by herself and interacting with society as little as possible. I believe this is true for a lot of people today who think it is cool or hip to shut themselves off from the world and society instead of participating in it.<br />The only way this could have been better is an epilogue into the future. In my mind, Q is the only one who will ever really understand the real Margo. I don't think there is any doubt that the two eventually will be a couple because Q has accomplished what a lot of people never do in life, truly connect with a person. Q and Margo remind me much of Sam and Charlie in The Perks of Being a Wallflower where both couples have connected in a way that is rare and will not likely happen again with anyone. As another reviewer pointed out, Margo's selfish personality that I believe changes at the end, is akin to The Great Gatsby and I would also include This Side of Paradise.<br /><br />**This is my first review of a book so it may not flow and be as concise as others**
B004QOB8SO|5.0|My son, daughter and I all love this series. It is so well written and every detail fits together so well. It has a sense of humor. It's fun to have the dvd's as you can watch them over and over discovering details missed on the first or second viewing.
034580404X|1.0|I had heard nothing but good things about this so I was excited to read it.  I found it to be very repetitive and pretty predictable.  I haven't had time to read the other reviews on this, but it seemed to me that maybe this was one book at one time and was stretched out to three, thus causing the repetition.  The steamy parts were almost laughably unrealistic (yeah, she climaxes every time even her first time, like that really happens in life) and the character of Christian Grey might be more believable if you aged him about 10-15 years.  However, the psychological and minor thriller aspects of the books is what kept me reading, so I guess it succeeded there.  If you are used to more quickly-paced thriller and/or exciting books, you probably won't like these.  But, take them with a grain of salt and go ahead and read them if you want to know what the fuss is about! :-)
B008FYZIVY|5.0|After Mad Men \\"jumped the shark\\" in Season 5 this year (2012), I bought the DVDs since I missed the \\"chopped up, dumbed-down\\" American version on PBS.

The Actors are gorgeous and I don't really find words to describe it. It's great. Maybe it's better to tell you something about the Special Features which are on the last DVD! It's about the actors and how to make the series which are based on the books of Sara Shepard. She tells something about her books and about -A which is the same on the books and on the series.<br />Then there is also a Feature about the actors (the main cast of the show --> Aria Montgomery (Lucy Hale), Spencer Hastings (Troian Bellissario), Hanna Marin (Ashley Benson) and Emily Fields (Shay Mitchell)!<br />The quality is great and if you like the series you really should buy this complete season! and if you don't know it you should buy it, too because you are going to be obsessed!!! Trust me!!<br />xoxo<br /><br />Ps: Toby and Caleb! AMAZING!

B006HGXGWU|4.0|****1/2<br /><br />Curtis LaForche keeps staring up at the sky.  Whether it's a bank of menacing storm clouds or a flock of birds flying in a strange formation he`s looking at, this Ohio construction worker is developing the unnerving sense that something is just not quite right with the world, and that Doom may be just over the horizon. It doesn't help that he's being plagued by a rash of dreams that seem to be reinforcing that conviction.  Before you know it, he's building an elaborate underground shelter and stocking it with emergency supplies - bankrupting the family and alienating those closest to him in the process.  Throughout, the movie forces us to keep asking the question: is he mentally ill or is there really something to this feeling?  Is he perhaps some modern-day Cassandra, cursed with the awareness of impending disaster but powerless to do anything to prevent it?<br /><br />Written and directed by Jeff Nichols, \\"Take Shelter\\" is a horror story told with all the quiet spareness of an apocalyptic parable.  The rural setting works for two seemingly contradictory reasons.  It brings a sense of foreboding to a small-town environment where threats to safety seem few and far between.  Yet, at the same time, the stark flatness of the Midwestern plane can make one feel immensely vulnerable against the powerful forces of nature - be it crackling thunderstorms, destructive tornadoes or just an endless sky filled with towering cloud formations that dwarf anything on the earth`s surface.<br /><br />What separates \\"Taking Shelter\\" from so many other films on the subject of mental illness is that Curtis (the stunning Michael Shannon) is not content to suffer in silence, but rather takes proactive steps to figure out what might be wrong with him on a medical level and to search for solutions.  It helps that his mother was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia when she was in her 30s, and so he figures he may be exhibiting symptoms of the same illness.<br /><br />The movie also explores the more mundane reality of working-class folk being just one paycheck away from poverty and loss of health care insurance.  That is the REAL doomsday scenario.<br /><br />On the surface, the film harkens back to those earlier days of atom-bomb scares, then brings it into the present with our current obsession with terrorist attacks.<br /><br />On a deeper level, it's about the Sword of Damacles - that unspecified object of dread - that dangles over our heads at every moment of our lives but which we choose to ignore as the only possible way of getting through life.  But Curtis, for whatever reason, is being forced to acknowledge its existence and the ever-present threat it poses to him and his family.  Our modern life has become so safety-bound and sanitized that we tend to forget that, through our entire history as a species, we've been confronted with daily threats to survival.  And Curtis seems to have somehow reconnected to that truth.  Yet, paradoxically, we've also become a people who magnify threats beyond their actual magnitude of probability (terrorism being just one example).<br /><br />The irony is that by focusing so intently on the apocalypse that may or may never come, Curtis is endangering those close to him in far more mundane ways: bankrupting the family, jeopardizing his job, alienating his friends and co-workers, and driving a wedge between himself and his understandably concerned wife (Jessica Chastain) and deaf little daughter (Tova Stewart) with his bizarre and frightening behavior.<br /><br />Featuring a flawless tour-de-force performance by Shannon, \\"Take Shelter\\" is a subtle, thoughtful and unnerving film that gets under one's skin - as any fine horror movie should.movie also explores the more mundane reality of working-class folk being just one paycheck away from poverty and loss of health care insurance.

It's not necessarily a large lego set, but it has a lot of little pieces and details I feel recreate some of the minecraft look. Like a tiny minecraft world.<br /><br />That being said, I would not recommend spending more then the $35 it goes for retail. A few weeks ago I saw that Amazon had 12 available for $35 and decided to wait and think about it. I came back a few hours later and all 12 were gone and people were selling it for $70! The next morning I signed on and saw it was back down to $35 and that's when I bought mine, by the afternoon they were all sold out again. I believe Amazon is starting to limit the number you can buy, which is great, but I will not support the people selling it for twice its worth.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|*Just letting you know in advance, MAJOR SPOILER ALERT*<br /><br />This was probably my favorite book in the Hunger Games trilogy. Most would probably begin to argue with me about that, because you(or at least I) feel so emotionally drained and empty and horrified. But that's what I like about it. I like it when a book makes you FEEL. And it definately made me feel.<br /><br />Like when uh…so-and-so died, and his life flashed before Katniss' eyes(so to speak) you could see it too, and something in me snapped, and I just started sobbing. Then later, when Peeta started to lose it, and she kissed him, ir happened again. And again. And again. Eventually by the time the book was over(at 3 in the morning) I felt so crushed, and depressed, and empty that I couln't get to sleep for hours just thinking about the book.<br /><br />There were so many deaths(of some of my favorite characters) and suprises and sobs and sleep deprivition (both from me) and just-raw. It was raw. No softening of anything. No cuddling, no sanding of the edges or anything. It was rough. An emotional roller coaster. One minute your elated that Peeta's alive and well , and the next your horrified and wondering what the hell they did to him to make him behave like that.<br /><br />One of my new favorite line/quote/thing(s) is &#34;real or not real?&#34; and &#34;always.&#34;(although it was already one of my favorites from Harry Potter) Read the book, find out why!<br /><br />Mockingjay took a completely different route from Hunger Games and Catching Fire. The games don't really come into play here. This is more Military-ish. And Suzanne also developed Finnick and Johanna more, which I loved.<br /><br />Anyways, before you start, make sure you have nothing to do today, becaus you won't be able to put Mockingjay down. And maybe grab some Kleenex, too. You're gonna need it.<br /><br />Now, why are you wasting time reading reviews?<br />GO READ MOCKINGJAY!
B0074EIQUG|4.0|Cajun supreme, and great blues.  A motivating album with no fillers.  So after self translation, because of the accent, enjoyable.
B007N85ZXY|2.0|While I have enjoyed Neil's music for many years, I found this one disappointing, as although it featured all the classic folk songs, they were all (except perhaps one) done in a much heavier style.<br />It could be said that new arrangements of old songs are to be commeneded, but when the soul is beaten out of the songs, I feel this was not the way to go!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I recommend this show to everyone. Absolutely love it. Season 4 is by far the best season. Can't wait for season 5.
0545140323|4.0|This is a very cute coming of age story. I found this story very entertaining and enjoyable. I really like the essence of girl power that is portrayed through this book.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Finally, all on Blue Ray format. For a Star Wars Fan like me, it is a great buy. Some may not like it as there are some additional inserts into the earlier movie. You have to decide on your own whether it is the collection you has been longing for.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|This is a recording that everyone have in their collection.<br />It's Paul simon at his creative best. I wish I would have gone to some of the tour dates.
B0042GIRYE|5.0|Another great Zac Brown CD. Like I've always said, some of their best songs are the ones not released as singles.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have a three month old and all the soothing melodies help him relax and doze off. I also listen to them when I'm reading or having a hard time falling to sleep.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Book is juicy but it doesn't have much of a plot. The next book is better. If you want to \\"get in the mood\\" then this is the perfect book. Just make sure you have someone to get in the mood with ;0).
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This app was surprisingly fun. I really enjoyed it. If you're good at puzzles this is for you. Its a breeze but its good if you have some time to spend.
B0073PPKNM|5.0|I'm really glad I waited awhile to review The Absence. I was disappointed the first few times we played it. My wife however loved it right away. Well it took me a few spins but I'm now at the point where I actually think this is at least equal to her pervious work if not better. We get to hear Melody sing in Brazilian Portugese (which is a romance language) for the first time and it's simply beautiful. I'm not going to go on and on here but I think that for any Melody fans that are poo pooing this effort, they need to set aside their expectations and be a little more open minded. Every single song on The Absence is straight up amazing.<br /><br />For any raving fans, Melody is beginning her tour of the U.S. in September 2012 and it's not one you're going to want to miss.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|This was the first Planet of the Ape movie I really enjoyed! The others were alright, but they were always a little short on reality(suspend the disbelief, suspend the disbelief!)and I had my problems with them. But to my somewhat skeptical mind this was a pretty darn good movie!

B0058YPGL6|5.0|Surprising is a good word to describe this show. I went into it expecting to just have a good time with lots of laughs and excellent eye candy and then I got hit with a 2x4 with how quality this show is. It sneaks up on you just how good Teen Wolf really is.<br /><br />There's such amazing character growth, supported by superb writing and acting. It has an excellent mix of drama and humor with a splash of horror thrown in. There are no \\"special issues\\" episodes, which seem to be part and parcel for shows aimed at teens. It does an excellent job handling homosexuality, female sexuality, and money issues without shoving it down our throats. It has a very believable light touch and not only do I wish more shows aimed at teens could handle stuff like this, I actually wish real life was more like this. It also showcases a variety of family relationships; there's a single mother, a single father, a divorced couple, an adopted child, and a nuclear family. The music on the show is, of course, quite good.<br /><br />The special features are lovely, I've actually watched the episodes with commentary and they are just too cute.<br /><br />If you give this series a chance I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I enjoy this game since I am fairly new to Mahjong. When I need to relax I play one game or many game. Whatever I feel like doing.
B0070NSPCU|4.0|I read a lot, some good, some not so good.  I have enjoyed this book after reading one of the \\"not so good\\" ones.  I enjoy the great descriptive writing and the development of the characters.  I am nearing the end of this book and I am already wondering how it will be wrapped up and when I can start the next one.  A very enjoyable book.I would recommend this to another reader.
B006LSZECO|1.0|It was a great story, but can't belive how the book ended. What a waste of time. The authour took the time to build up the story than just took no time for a ending. Dont waste your time or money !!!
B004L35GAQ|5.0|I love this album!  I originally purchased because of the song \\"Sail\\" (heard it on \\"Longmire\\" - lets hope that show sticks around!), but after hearing the whole album I am very glad I purchased it (and not just the song)  There are others that are fast becoming favorites (particularly the last song - 14 minutes long, but I grew up with Stairway to Heaven, Freebird, Green Grass & High Tides, etc, so it is kind of nice to hear a longer song!) I highly recommend.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The book was a bit boring for me.  I did not enjoy the first half as it seemed to ramble on and on.
0425263908|1.0|Is it just me or is this book very much similar to 50 Shades?? Everything is almost the same: the sexual theme, the characters, their issues, etc! I couldn't believe when I was reading this... seriously?? And for it to have a sequel too, it's very 50 Shades. The only thing better about this is Sylvia writes a lot better than E.L. James. I just wished she exerted more effort in thinking of another plot for her book. And I am not saying this because I'm a fan of E.L. James' trilogy. It was just weird to me that another writer would go the same route. MORE ORIGINALITY PLEASE!!!
B001NEXEEG|5.0|Delivered on time and in perfect condition.  Great classic western movie with John Wayne, Jimmy Steward, and Lee Marvin.  Directed by John Ford.  Purchased through Amazon.<br />[[ASIN:B001NEXEEG The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]]

B007J4T2G8|4.0|This was an interesting read.  The author did a good job of setting up the relationship of Ana and Christian well.<br />By the end of the first book you really wanted to download the second to see where their relationship was going.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app! I need some some noise to fall asleep. This app lets me pick what sounds I find soothing and put them together each at a different volume if I wish. Then i just plug in my kfire at my bedside, set the timer, check the box to close the app when done and drift off to sleep. Love It!
B007L7JY3Y|3.0|I loved this on the iPhone and was very excited to get it on Android. I didn't need the sync option when I was on the iPhone, but now that I've got Google Tasks, I would really like that ability. I have a Chrome extension that lets me add to my Google Tasks from the toolbar so I can quickly access that list. The todo list I primarily use syncs to Google Tasks so I can enter something on my desktop and have it show up in my phone. The tabs are awesome and the interface is much better than anything else I've tried, and I think I've tried them all. I like 2Do MUCH better than the other app, but that is a feature that I can't give up. Despite that, I like it enough to have paid for it knowing it couldn't sync with Google. I just hope that some day they'll decide to.
B008K8U13K|3.0|The game is good, but if you use touchscreen based controls, you might be unhappy. There are magnetic joysticks available on Amazon, I don't know how well they work. Maybe someone will make a tablet cover with built in bluetooth joysticks that work with games like this. Of course you can always buy a nintendo DS.

B0027DK206|4.0|After seeing the 1 star reviews, I got paranoid about Super difficult exposures, and jams.<br /><br />I ran through my first pack and didn't have anything jam on me just yet. The instruction manual stated that the reduced capturing area meant the viewfinder would be larger than the picture. But I wear glasses and the instant back itself gets in the way, so in a way the viewfinder captures only the very center 2/5ths of the image, much less if you change the lens to anything but the 110mm telephoto.<br /><br />A flash is necessary for most situations with this. I use the hotshoe adapter and a cheap $12 flashgun.<br /><br />Instax gives no film latitude, shadows are way too dark, highlights are blown but not as bad, thank goodness. It still has that white space, and it's such a shame this back doesn't have a sharpie holder.<br /><br />As others have said, I wouldn't pay the full price for this unless you know you'll be using it. And even then, the Instax Mini 7s is actually cheaper (and I guess more reliable) than this. Buy it only if you already have a diana.<br /><br />At best photos cost $0.70 per shot, which is still cheaper than develop and print for medium format.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|great choices.....realistic sounds!  the timer is a great feature and it automatically will close the app.  I highly recommend this one!
0062124293|5.0|I am a strong feminist with a background in women's studies so I have been reading feminist manifestos since college.  From Naomi Wolf to Gloria Steinem and everyone in between, I struggled to understand how any woman would not consider herself a feminist but time and life experience have shown me that we all come from different places that allow us to say what it means to be a woman. Caitlin Moran should be considered the new voice for women and feminism.  She manages to take on the sacred cows of feminism with humor, dignity, and humility and challenges her readers to take a broader view of the world and the role that women play.  I laughed so hard that I cried in many parts of the book while other parts made me cry with the memory of similar experiences.  I have bought copies for my mother and my best friends and will continue to promote this book to anyone and everyone!!!  I could not put it down until the very last page and then I wanted to start all over again!
B000FC1MCS|5.0|I enjoyed this book a lot. Its easy fun and hard to put down. Passed it to my mum wh is 84 and she loved it too.
B00136JPB0|5.0|Short Review:  I ended up writing a little too much about this album.  Here's the take-home message: if you enjoy alternative music, you owe it to yourself to seek this album out.  It's a beautiful and sincere work of art.<br /><br />Longer Review:<br />Jeff Buckley's life was a freak occurrence.  Artists and songwriters like him come around only a few times in a generation, and unfortunately, Buckley was only able to release one proper studio album before his accidental death.  Buckley's debut, GRACE, is a masterwork.  The album sounds effortless, delicate, powerful, and emotionally raw -- it's characterized primarily by Buckley's angelic voice.  GRACE's impact and influence on alternative music can't be understated -- Thom Yorke of Radiohead once stated that the song \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\" (a significant creative milestone for the band at the time) was written directly after seeing Buckley live in concert.  At times it's comforting; at times it's haunting; it's always, however, beautiful.  Originally released to mixed reviews and poor sales, GRACE only saw success (commercial and critical) after the death of Buckley some years later.  Composed of 10 tracks (with 3 of them covers), Jeff Buckley's first and only studio album is essential listening for fans of alternative music.<br /><br />GRACE begins with \\"Mojo Pin,\\" a song that does well to surmise almost everything that the album has to offer; the song has soaring vocals (and high reaching falsettos), pastoral guitar work, laid-bare lyrics, crunching distortion, and a seemingly effortless shifting between tones and styles.  I remember, years ago, hearing the song for the first time and scratching my head and wondering \\"who is this?\\"  It's an unforgettable sound that Buckley has, and the remaining 9 tracks only offer more.  While \\"Hallelujah\\" is surely the most recognized of Buckley's work, it was never released as a single; the selftitled track was the lead single initially released to promote the album.  It's one of Buckley's more aggressive songs, and it's middle interlude finds Buckley screaming -- with it's lyrics considering death and beyond (notably \\"It's my time coming, I'm not afraid, afraid to die\\"), it's a haunting listen in retrospect.  \\"Last Goodbye,\\" the album's next track, found the most success during Buckley's short life.  The song never quite worked for me, as it always felt like the most conventional track on all of GRACE -- live versions would find the song using more Buckley-esque hallmarks, but as it remains on his debut, it's conventional by his standards.<br /><br />Much like opening track \\"Mojo Pin,\\" \\"So Real\\" combines most of Jeff Buckley's songwriting techniques into one song.  It's perhaps the most haunting of all the songs here: a song that sounds eerily paranoid.  It's ending refrain is sure to send shivers up listener's spines.  Perhaps one of my favorites is the seventh track: \\"Lover, You Should Have Come Over.\\"  This bluesy track is a beautiful serenade to a lost love, and while Buckley's lyrics are quite beautiful, nothing compares to the emotions that his music evokes.  At over 6 minutes long, every note in the song sounds essential -- it's a perfect recording.  Every time the song plays, I have to stop what I'm doing only to become lost in it.  \\"Eternal Life\\" is surely the most straightforward of all the songs on GRACE: it's a stomping, crunching, distorted rocker.  While it may be rougher around the edges than other songs, it doesn't suffer from a lack of nuance though.  The final track, \\"Dream Brother\\" is a more psychedelic departure than anything else on Buckley's debut.  It's a dreamy, atmospheric song that uses nearly-tribal rhythms to give it an otherworldly vibe.  It's a haunting ending to one of the 90's best albums.<br /><br />The three covers recorded here are \\"Lilac Wine,\\" \\"Corpus Christi Carol,\\" and \\"Hallelujah.\\"  The most well-known of all of Buckley's work manifests itself in a cover of Leonard Cohen's \\"Hallelujah.\\"  While Cohen's original preceded this rendition by nearly a decade, Buckley's cover is the definitive take on the song.  The song features only Buckley's vocals and his guitar, and it's one of the most beautifully captivating songs put to tape.  The rest of Buckley's covers suffer in comparison: not because they are bad songs, but because besting \\"Hallelujah\\" is quite the tall order.  \\"Lilac Wine,\\" originally written by James Shelton in the 1950's, is a mesmerizing ballad.  The lyrics recount a lilac tree, the wine made from said tree, and his lover -- it's sincere and sexy.  \\"Corpus Christi Carol\\" is a pastoral hymn that dates back to the 1500's (yes, you read that right).  Buckley doesn't attempt to make the traditional hymn an alternative rock hit -- instead, he recreate a rather faithful rendition of the song which lets his vocal soar for ridiculously high falsettos.<br /><br />Jeff Buckley's one and only studio album is a must-listen.  I originally bought it on the advice of others, and years later, I still have it on normal rotation.  It's an album that is everything at once: it's eerie, it's beautiful, it's happy, it's mournful, it's romantic, it's pragmatic.  With lyrics that often focus on life and mortality, GRACE is all the more tragic in the wake of Buckley's untimely death.  Essential tracks to sample/download: \\"[[ASIN:B00136LQXK Hallelujah]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B00136NSNG Grace]],\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B00136PZEG Lover, You Should've Come Over]].\\"n's original preceded this rendition by nearly a decade, Buckley's cover is the definitive take on the song.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|My husband purchased this eBook and loaned it to me after he'd finished. I enjoyed it very much; the author does an excellent job of creating his characters and making you care about them in a very short time. He also keeps you guessing about where his plot is headed and ties things up in a very satisfying manner - while allowing room for a sequel ;-)<br /><br />I would DEFINITELY recommend this book, even to someone who isn't \\"into\\" Science Fiction, because it's very plotty, character-driven, and the tech is easily accessible without being overstated.
1416594795|5.0|After reading Dawkins's \\"The Magic of Reality\\" to my kids each night (which my 13 y/o and 9 y/o both love), I snuggled into my own bed and also read his latest book (for adults), \\"The Greatest Show on Earth\\".  While I have read almost all of Dawkin's books, I must say this is amongst my favorites......literally bringing tears of amazement to my eyes.  Dawkins brings stunning clarity and broad wisdom in presenting objective, unifying, diverse, and virtually irrefuteable scientific evidence for evolution.  He leaves no doubt.  He shows that evolution is by no means a theory in the lay definition of \\"theory\\", i.e. unproven conjecture.  Rather he presents evolution in the strictly scientific definition of 'theory\\", i.e. a proven, reproducible, testable, dependable concept.  I would argue that evolution is even more, actually a basic LAW OF NATURE.  As such it is as real as the Law of Gravity, or the Laws Governing Conservation of Mass and Energy.  Even the most narrow-minded, uniformed, biased zealot would be amazed by the incredible breadth of evidence Dawkins presents in support of what I call \\"the law of evolution\\".  He provides centuries of bacterial, plant, and animal speciation data, accurate geological and cosmological dating information, traditional/mendalian genetic insights, modern (DNA) molecular genetic revelations, chemical/isotopic explanations, and of course, actual fossil record information (surprisingly the last proving to be the least important of all).  Amazingly, all of this independent and indisputeably derived information converges upon, and can be explained by, only one simple evolutionary fact.......that every living species on this planet derived from a common shared ancestor.  He presents ancestry \\"trees\\" which demonstrate how such common ancestors emerged amongst both plants and animals, many tracing back to the beginings of life on earth billions of years ago.  He completely debunks the \\"fossil search for a missing link\\" gambit as completelyirrelavent, despite that argument being so often advocated by creationists and intelligent designers.  Dawkins does not discuss religion at all in his text, but rather only presents solid objective evidence of all types, yet understandable to non-scientists.  He throws this evidence open to close scrutiny and challenge by anyone.  Whether to embrace or reject the idea of evolution, one certainly needs to at least consider these facts.  Dismissing evolution as only \\"a theory\\" while continuing to completely ignore proven facts, is simply disgraceful.<br /><br />Humans desparately and rightfully fear Nature's obvious indiscriminate and often cruel power.  It seems difficult to rationalize such indifference in the context of a \\"responsive and all-loving God\\".  Even worse, it is virtually impossible to mentally conceive of the unimaginably long timeframe over which genetic change occurs under varying selective pressures.  Thus it is much easier to simply take the memetic way out, i.e. succumb to delusional (but biblically appealing) notions of a 6000 year old earth, designed and ruled by a divine power that is still responsive to our needs and pleas.  Understanding evolution actually brings us much closer to a more realistic \\"God\\" than ever before, enabling us to finally see ourselves as top dog contenders in the cosmological and timeless realm of NATURE.  As such, we are perhaps one of her more amazing genetic outcomes ever.  Dawkins delivers warm clarity in revealing that, as well as in explaining how and why it happens.  From such knowledge should emerge confidence that our own species will continue to survive and thrive along with, and in spite of, Mother Nature's fury.

0307352145|5.0|This book shows clearly where extrovert as an ideal quality comes from historically.  This book also goes into the differences between extroverts and introverts.  Explaining how an introvert can use their qualities positively in life, you learn that introverted people can be powerful influences in life.<br /><br />Personally for me, reading this book has been a relief.  Suddenly my own life makes sense and I am better able to also understand why the world around me is the way it is as well.

B006VZS1EA|5.0|I was reluctant to watch this movie, because it was so harshly criticized by the \\"professional\\" movie critics.  When I finally sat down to watch the movie, though, I was delightfully surprised.  By the final scene, I was clapping and cheering for the underdog.  It really is a feel-good movie from start to finish.  Perhaps movie critics spend too much time looking at \\"technique\\" or whatever.  Perhaps movie critics only get paid when they find something \\"wrong\\" with a movie.  I think that perhaps movie critics are just too full of themselves.<br /><br />Regardless, if you are a human being, you will really love this movie. :-)

B006LSZECO|4.0|This book caught me off guard and unawares.  At first it seemed it was all about the sad musings of a married couple down on their luck, but, midway through the story, the diabolical plot was hatched and I was so intrigued that I couldn't put the book down.  I found the story misleading in the very best sense of the word -- I thought I had the plot all figured out, only to realize later that all my conclusions and sympathies towards certain characters were absolutely wrong and misdirected.<br /><br />This is the perfect read if you're looking for a psychologically twisted and suspense-filled story.

B004EPYZZ8|5.0|This film is a must see!<br /><br />Simply put, if you want a family friendly film - with no swearing, no inappropriate content whatsoever - then this is it. It contains an absolutely golden Christian message put into a palatable form for anyone. Thank you to the writers who chose not to water down its content. Jesus saves, heals, and protects those who reach out to him! He can turn terrible tragedy into great triumph! This film shows that very clearly, and the lead performance from the talented young AnnaSophia Robb shines through.<br /><br />Some have criticized her performance for being weak, and I would make a strong argument against this. The real brave young woman she is portraying is a kind, laid-back, meek young woman, exactly like the one portrayed in the film. She was giving an accurate depiction of how she really is in real life.<br /><br />God bless this film and its message!!<br /><br />Rep
1400069289|4.0|For anyone looking to form new habits or change old ones, this has the potential to be an important book. I did find it somewhat academic. It's not a riveting read like a novel--but then its purpose is not to entertain. As far as an academic work goes, I found it pretty readable. There are alot of very interesting anecdotes about the use of habits in various venues--including by Michael Phelps. If you're not up for reading all the details, you can skip around some. However, your understanding of what triggers habit formation will be improved by having more information.

0553801473|3.0|Characters come and go, and the only characters I still care about are the Starks, of many of whom there seems to be almost no word in the last two books. I thought the third book was starting to slow down, the fourth one was just a lot of padding, and the fifth one is trying to get started again. Better than the previous one, too many words that get nowhere, still an interesting read. Let's hope the next installment will come faster than the five years it took to get this one done.
B007Y36K46|4.0|Didn't read any reviews before purchasing this product. Just liked the book and wanted to see how it was interpreted 100 years later.  I create cgi and found this movie a lot of fun from that prospective.  Not a movie I would show to anyone under 13 an then only if they have some maturity because of the violence and theme.  Not sure why Disney put all the eggs on this movie, just not going to appeal to most people.  But if you like old sci-fi then you will like this.
B0063ESZ9K|4.0|I bought the X10 and one of the less expensive leather cases.  The less expensive case fit rather poorly, in my opinion.  It was just to loose around the camera.  I order this case and it fit perfectly -- not loose at all.  Rated 4 stars just because its kind of expensive.
B001KQZ7I8|3.0|First half of the book was good. The historical aspects of it were fascinating.  The book is worth the price just for that.  I know a lot of people get into the second half of the book, but I did not.  It was too philosophical and long winded for me. The concepts that were being presented could have been done in a few pages.  In fact, I really like the overview of the book at the book's beginning.
B005LZW8FO|1.0|Mostly dull movie about a teenager who ruins her life from a drunk driving accident.<br />The other earth is used as a metaphor about second chances.<br />Only ever see other earth as photoshop in the sky in some scenes.<br />Spend your time elsewhere.
B003VS0CX8|1.0|One Star Release for a FIVE star movie. Not all Blu-Ray is the same. This disk will not play the movie in my Blu-Ray player.  The menus work but the movie just locks up.  I have to unplug the player to get it to reset.  I bought this and have to watch the DVD version. I watch other Blu-Ray movies on the same player, but not this one.  Looks like I have to stop buying Blu-Ray movies until the Blu-Ray specification stops changing then buy a new player. Very Disappointed!

0425263908|1.0|Yes, I read Fifty Shades first and lived and breathed Christian and Ana until the last page of the third book (Although, I did have issues with FSOG but I will save that for a FSOG review).  So, that is probably why I will not be able to finish Bared to You.  I could have tolerated a few similarities, but SERIOUSLY?????  I would be PISSED if I was E.L. James.  I am only a 1/4 into the book and would throw it across the room if it wasn't on my Kindle :).  Based on what I read so far, and how it appears to follow the exact storyline as FSOG, I can predict the entire book....he only wants sex and not a relationship...blah blah...sex scene...he falls in love with her...blah blah...sex scene...something will happen and they won't be able to be together...blah blah...sex scene...Elena oops, Magdelene (is that her name, who cares?) gets into a cat fight with Eva...blah blah...sex scene...love prevails...sex scene..blah blah.  If someone actually read the entire book and I am wrong, PLEASE let me know and I will gather as much strength as I can to try to finish it.  If I'm right, then I just saved a few hours of my life.

B004FGMDOQ|1.0|Whilst it was quite interesting to see how the author developed the plot around the old photographs the plot did not work for me. A story line somewhere between 'Alice In Wonderland\\" and \\"Harry Potter', the dialogue of the English characters was unconvincing. In fact development of the characters other than the \\"hero\\" or main character was non existent, leaving the reader caring very little about what happened to any of them.  Don't waste your time!
B0050PYNOY|4.0|How does one begin to describe this movie?  First of, it is a comedy mixing American slapstick, porn-level raunchiness, and British wit all at the same time.  Second, it is a gory and bloody action movie, easily on par with Kingdom of Heaven and Troy in terms of graphic violence.  Third, it is a respectable medieval fantasy flick.  Remove the comedy and gore, and the remaining story is a tale cut in the same mold as Legend, Willow, and Dragon Slayer.  Put together, and you get a box-office bomb that is almost a cult classic on the home release market.  Everyone who sees it will remember it, and either love it or hate it.  The casting is respectable and the acting is limited or enhanced (depending on your opinion of the movie) by its script.  The dialogue is workable, full of snide jokes, swearing, and adult humor.  The special effects are original, believable, and serve the script well.  Nothing on the order of say a Michael Bay film, but still good.  This package is quite nice with both the theatrical and unrated versions present.  This package also includes extended, alternate and deleted scenes not found in either film version.  Just one warning, this is easily an R-rated film.  Once you put the disc into your player, the opening menu starts out with a well-designed comic sequence set to some lively music that is probably the cleanest part of the viewing experience.  The raunchiness just climbs from there.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This is a very nice cover and I like that I can set it up to hold the Kindle and read without hands.  The color is fun and matches my other electronics.  Would certainly recommend.
0740797719|5.0|I have bought many books on painting for oils and this one is by far the best. He doesn't get into the technicalities of mixing but he does cover everything else.  This book is a must read for beginners and professionals alike.  Whether you oil paint, watercolor, digital, marker, crayon, ect.. you won't regret buying this book.
B007CIQ4B2|4.0|Howard has an amazing mellow sound that soothes the soul.  I really love several of the tracks so much that I listen to them over and over- especially at the gym or if I have had a bad day. Only Love is his radio smash, but if you like that you will love Keep your Head up.  This man has gone through a dark time in his life and his music expresses the emotions as you climb out of the dark and into the light. Keep your Head up is uplifting and catchy.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Recommended this book to my friends. I had read the many 5 star reviews, but was still reluctant to read it due to the main characters having cancer.  This easily became one of my all time favorite reads.  I found myself both chuckling a bit out loud & at times sobbing with emotion. I could identify looking at the big picture of life through their eyes and how precious moments are with our loved ones.

B008BM9L72|5.0|I must say that i really enjoyed the books - now that I have finished them I feel that I have lost a friend. Some of the erotic sections did get a little repetative but overall I think the books were excellent. Hope there may be a book number 4 ....who know's.
0893860220|5.0|This is a great book that is up there with \\"A Course in Miracles\\".  It is a book I try to keep on my person at all times for a quick fix of right mindedness and spiritual grounding.  It is second to \\"Course in Miracles\\" on spirituality and metaphysics.  I have found a few contradictions, but who cares when the rest of the book is full of great wisdom and perspective.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read the first 3 or 4 chapter and got bored.  There is nothing stimulating in this book, nothing to keep me interested in wanting to read more.  If I had to pick between this and the Twilight Series (even that was awful but at least I finished it), I would pick Twilight. I really don't know what all the hype is about, if you're looking to get some better fantasy in Romance novel, you're better off reading a real romance novel.  I didn't finish this book and really regretted purchasing it on my Kindle, I should have download a summary first.
B005EI86JU|5.0|This is a comprehensive book with complete details of the Nikon D7000 menus, controls, options and capabilities. Please do not misunderstand and assume that the author will teach you how to be a good photographer using this camera. His goal, as I understand, is to provide you with detailed descriptions of the capabilities of the camera. He assumes the role of a guide who tells you what your camera controls are and what they do. It is up to you, to create great results using his advice. This book nearly replaces the actual camera manual. It is more like the \\"Missing Manual\\" series that you get for software tools.<br /><br />Nearly all control options have a section where the author describes his 'recommendations' with practical reasoning behind his choices. These are the most helpful sections, because you get to know the trade-offs of using one option over the other. The author also describes real-life scenarios where some option might be more useful than the other. Very useful to unleash the full potential of your D7000.<br /><br />Highly recommended!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this simple and addictive game - no frills but thats what is great.  I have it on my iPhone as well as my Kindle Fire - the latter is visually much more appealing
B007XIO9TU|4.0|It's nice to see Mr. Winter \\"still alive and well\\". Paul Nelson and the rest of the band really know how to support Johnny so that he can put his best foot forward. (I hope he hangs onto these guys for a long time.) It's also nice to see Johnny standing for a portion of the performance. (He had hip surgery in the past.) But the best part of this video is taking the Johnny Winter energy ride for another spin around the track. He has never failed to amaze me, (and I have been a fan for almost forty years).

B008M0HAVW|5.0|This is written to be readable by non-physicists and explains all technical points very clearly and with very little mathematics.  However, it is also very complete, detailed and well balanced.  It relates the development of quantum physics starting with Plank's black body radiation law. It is not until two thirds of the way through the book that it actually discusses the debates between Bore and Einstein, and that is as it should be, because that only makes sense in the context of what they and others had contributed and thought before the full theory was formulated.  It is important, for instance, that it was Einstein who introduced probability into quantum physics in the first place (so that was not his main objection to the Copenhagen Interpretation).<br />It relates that Bore pointed out to Heisenberg that the uncertainty principle is a general property of waves, and therefore easy to see from Schrodinger's point of view.  This has been overlooked in other books I have read.  Here it is explained with simple diagrams, without assuming the knowledge of Fourier transforms that the physicists of that time presumably had.<br /><br />Though Einstein was completely wrong in doubting qm, his thought experiments were valuable.  The one where Einstein forgot to take general relativity into account, as this book points out, served to show that macroscopic objects obey the rules of qm.  This had not been clear in Bore's ideas.  It is still useful; for example, it tends to rule out Roger Penrose's idea that gravity washes out qm effects when a body reaches a certain weight.<br />The EPR one really did show a fatal flaw in the Copenhagen Interpretation, though not in qm itself.<br /><br />The book fails to warn us early on that both Bore and Einstein were wrong in their own ways, each trying to retain something of classical physics.  (It seems to me that the one who was closest to right was Schrodinger.)<br />This book seems to me to be already somewhat outdated.  When the author says \\"reality\\", he, as in older books, means classical reality, and he tends to equate qm with Copenhagen some of the time.  Schrodinger and Everett saw reality as being the state vector or wave function, and they realized that macroscopic objects can exist in quantum superpositions.  They realized that whatever one says about quantum mechanics, classical physics is no more than an approxiation to it.  This latter view has become dominant in recent years.  He does mention the Many Worlds Interpretation at the end, but since the book is largely for people who are not already familiar with such views, they should be presented early on, or even used as a standard by which Bore's and Einstein's positions are judged.<br />With this one reservation, it is an excellent book.<br /><br />I add one more point:  All these books say that the Copenhagen Interpretation was dominant until recent decades.  However, from the time I first read about qm in the early 1950s in Fred Hoyl's ''Frontiers of Astronomy'' through 20 years of intensively studying and using qm (and taking one philosophy of science class) to converting a scattering formula from Messiah and other qm books to electromagnetic waves to solve a radar problem, I never heard the idea that there is a physical process called wave function collapse.  Everyone assumed that qm is just the way the world is and that is all the interpretation one needs, the probabilities must come out of the mathematics in one way or another.  I only encountered wave function collapse when I started editing and reading Wikipedia.  I encountered Many Worlds when I then read Everett's article.  So Schrodinger's idea that the wave function is reality has been much more common than these books say.  The reason the interpretation is not often discussed is that it is simply that classical physics is only an approximation.author says \\"reality\\", he, as in older books, means classical reality, and he tends to equate qm with Copenhagen some of the time.

1468161660|5.0|Let me first say that I'm a 30-something mom that happens to love YA fiction.  And this book was everything I look for in a book.  Funny, suspenseful, sad, romantic, unforgettable.  I wanted to BE in this story, even though all of the characters suffer much heartbreak.  It was very well written.  I laughed and cried, and I want more.  I'm not sure how a second one could \\"quench my thirst\\" for what I experienced with this one, but I will definitely be reading the second one!  Kudos to the author!  The characters were very real, believable, and had depth.  I could really relate to them, even though I have not experienced the heart break that they have been through... there was still just some way I connected, and fell in love with them.  I had never heard of \\"Slam\\" poetry, and I really enjoyed learning about it, and reading the poetry from the characters.  The author did amazing with the poetry!  It makes me want to explore this type of poetry.  My husband was skeptical when I was telling him about the book and mentioned poetry, and thought it sounded boring.  The book is not ABOUT poetry, but it is very intwined into the essence of the book.  And it made me appreciate poetry in a way that I never have.  Read this book.  Even if for some reason, you don't love it, you will definitely not regret reading this.  Good job Ms. Hoover!  You have a new fan!!
B006N9KFPC|5.0|The first time I heard Trespassing, I was a little bewildered.  There were two or three standout tunes, but there also seemed to be a bunch of superficial dance music. I was WRONG!  Now that I've listened to it hundreds of times (it is the only CD I play in my car plus I use it when I do my 2 mile walk) I have started to really appreciate its heart-wrenching honesty (even in the dance songs, which really aren't superficial at all). Adam may possibly reveal a bit less of his vocal fireworks, but when he does it is so spot-on.  He has a magnificent voice and in Trespassing he employs it in the interest of emotional truth.  Highly recommended!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Can't believe I fell for all the hype these books generated. I wasted time and money reading this crap when I could have been reading real literature written by a real author who actually knows how to write.

B005CRQ4XI|3.0|The book was interesting to me because many people in my family have hiked the John Muir trail and from what I understand from the book that is part of the Pacific Crest Trail.  From the review that Ophra gave it I expected more of a reflective book and found that it did'nt have that quality, atleast for me.
B008ER9QLK|1.0|Alex Ross wrote in The New Yorker that \\"pound for pound, ton for ton, it is the most witless and wasteful production in modern operatic history.\\" Anthony Tommasini wrote in The New York Times that while \\"the machine represents a breakthrough in stage technology,\\" it was \\"the most frustrating opera production I have ever had to grapple with.\\"<br /><br />They were right.  If this production were marketed as a minimalistic  produciton and the DVD price was not so high I would have let a lot more pass. There are Robert Wilson and Peter Sellars productions far blander than this, but the difference is that Lapage offers no perspective.  Not to belittle the work of the other parts of the production, but this is a staging that the Met should be ashamed of.  And worst of all, the audacity to call this Ring a perfect realization of Wagner's vision is an affirmation that things at the Met is utterly in denial, and for that, this deserves 1 star.<br /><br />The production is centered on one innovation--a machine of rotating planks that at first showed a lot of promise but quickly turned into gimmick and finally into an eye-sore.  Let's start at the beginning: Das Rheingold is easily the most impressive of the cycle.  It opens with the machine in a vertical position, with the Rhine-maidens slowly descending upwards as if swimming in the Rhine.  The machine acts as a backdrop with images of bubbles and falling sand, which somewhat react to the singer's voices.  This scene is visually impressive and is made remarkable mostly due to Eric Owen's fantastic Alberich.  Other interesting bits, such as the rainbow bridge and the descent into Nibelheim, show that Lapage did have some great ideas.  But it's in the other parts that actually show Lapage's clumsiness and laziness--a seriously static Scene 2 and Scene 3 where the machine is just either gray or brick red, in the form of stairs that add nothing but blandness to the scene.<br /><br />Die Walkure affirms the fact that the machineis just a really low-quality background projection.  Act I's empty stage with a table, two chairs, and a fuzzy wood background is not genius, but at least the performances of Jonas Kaufmann and Eva-Maria Westbroek made it bearable.  The problem here is that the staging has nothing to say--no new insight into the story.  And although this in itself is not a problem, the problem is that at least did not offer anything nice or interesting to look at. The Ride of the Valkyries was just silly; watching them sliding down the planks of the machine was a little embarrassing, although musically it was fantastic. The Magic Fire scene was the only impressive scene, with Brunhilde's obvious double, hanging backwards from the top of the distorted machine.<br /><br />Siegfried plunges into greater catastrophe, where the machine becomes a glorified background screensaver.  What's worse is that nothing--not the machine or the singers--seem to be aware what is going on with the music.  Everything is so disjointed, with no direction or plan.  The costumes, projected nature images and set pieces (placed in a trench) are all smoothly naturalistic--that is, it looks like the wallpaper selection of a new Mac, with no character or aura.<br /><br />Gotterdammerung is by far the most embarrassing of all.  It's not a good sign when the Immolation scene solicits laughs from the audience.  A small funeral pyre of logs is built upstage. Brünnhilde lights it on fire and mounts her skeletal Grane and is rolled SO SLOWLY towards it. The music soars fantastically but we are not allowed to enjoy it due to the fact that what is going on the stage is so UTTERLY RIDICULOUS.  The Machine rotates her out of view, and the machine is covered with the lamest and fuzziest projections of flames. Then little plastic statues of the gods are risen awkwardly at the top of the Machine and their heads just fall off, then they are lowered out of view.  The water screensaver is cued and then it's over...<br /><br />No amount of new cuts or edits can change the fact that this staging, and the fact that people defend it and prefer it so, is one of the main reasons that the Met is quickly falling as the best opera house in the U.S.  Rent this just so you can see how bad a Ring Cycles can get.

M5 seems to have one or two songs like that, to get on the hit list, but did they just give up?<br />Where's the guitars, the bass, the drums?  Oooo there it is next to the auto-tune switch.<br />i have hands all over, and its an ok CD but only 1 or 2 songs stood out from the album.  There is none in this one.<br />They have talent, but they want money more than passion.<br />Sad to say Maroon 5 is gone and Maroon 1 guy with a computer took their name.
B004LGE2LC|5.0|I was pretty apprehensive about this movie before I watched it, mainly because it was on subject of dragons. I'm not big on stories about make believe creatures, or wizards, or magic, or any of that Harry Potter type stuff. Surprisingly though, this movie was not like that at all.<br /><br />It takes place in a post-apocalyptic earth, where the human race is dwindling on extinction and the remaining survivors are struggling to endure. The characters played by Christian Bale and Matthew McConaughey are both pretty intriguing, and much of the plot involves the ego battle that goes on between the two.<br /><br />The special effects are done well, and by that I mean that the creators of this movie did not go overboard with special effects. They used CGI with discretion, and the scenes that actually had dragons in them were done pretty tastefully.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is a story about human survival and overcoming the odds in a very troubled world. I liked it, and I will likely be watching this one again in the future.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|it look like a good app so I downloaded it. As soon as I tried it I fell asleep.  but I do agree I wish I could listen to it while doing other things on my kindle fire.plus it's free. I highly recommend it &lt;3
B00866JL96|4.0|Although the attractivenes of leading actor Efron and actress Schilling will never leave you wanting, sometimes throughout the movie there are just many misses but you never cease rooting for them to conquer their demons and find love.  I think the script was just too cheesy and predictable at times and the acting and directing was not enough to compensate and carry the viewer through it without noticing, but still who doesn't want our returning soldiers to win both there and after returning home - especially U.S. Marine Sergeant Logan Thibault returning from his third tour of duty in Iraq when most of his buddies did not and has to answer the tough question of why is he the lucky one to survive.  Could it be his guardian angel pictured in the photograph he found?<br /><br />Dealing with PTSD and the struggle of truly realizing he is not living in death-risking enemy territory any longer, Logan decides to walk from Colorado to Hampton, North Carolina in search of his lucky charm/angel.  Learning her name is Beth (Schilling) and where she lives, he shows up at her door, and ends up taking a job at her family-run local kennel. She has her own demons with whom she struggles: the death of her marine brother who lost her photograph, raising a son on her own from a high school pregnancy with an over-controlling baby-daddy, death of both of her parents, and trying to help her aging grandmother run the pet hotel despite her recent stroke.  Despite both Logan's and Beth's numerous trials and tribulations, they are both so kind and nice and responsible people that you just have to root for them to conquer those demons and find each other and find love.<br /><br />It is all too cliche and predictable but yet so relevant and dealing with many of our country's tough problems.  I loved [[ASIN:B005S9EK1S The Lucky One (Movie only+UltraViolet) [Blu-ray]]]. It was like working out your problems with a long slow walk in the beautiful countryside with great country to unwind and leave your troubles behind in.  When it was all too cliche and predictable, I thought \\"country corny!\\"  and I think this movie would definitely feel more at home to those living rurally or in very small towns than to us city slickers.  But, who'd have known that inside of me resides a lover of country corn?<br /><br />Wouldn't it be wonderful if all our troubles end in loving embrace with Efron/Schilling?<br /><br />aaaaaaaahyour troubles behind in.

B007QXU0ZO|2.0|This is a very disapointing follow up to \\"Up From Below\\". I love Edward Sharpe's  first album, and it had everything that this album lacks.  The album starts off on a promising note, in fact I would suggest just getting that track, \\"Man on Fire\\". This alone is upsetting, because I know that is an older song. I saw them live two years ago and they played it, so I'm hoping that wasn't the last drop from the well.<br /> At first I went through the \\"Maybe I'm just not getting it\\" phase, gave it several listens and I'm ready to trash it. The music is listless and bland, the lyrics are silly and there is just nothing that even suggests the songs would play out better live.<br />I do, however, like the recording quality on the album. It sounds as if Alan Lomax visited a commune and recorded all of their revival meetings.<br />Unfortunately the whole cult commune thing now sounds a bit contrived. While it added a mystery to the first record, it sounds dopey and weak on this one.<br />A better purchase would be \\"Alexander\\", the solo album by Alex Ebert, the messianic frontman for the Magnetic Zeroes. He plays everything and sings everything on that album, and it has a fun, energetic feel to it. He may want to stop being so generous to the rest of the band and just assume control, because they won't make it much farther if another stinker like this is released.<br />  I loved seeing this band live, and I'm really hoping this isn't the start of a decline, because I thought there was some real magic there. I'd hate to see them fizzle so quickly, but they need to dig deeper.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I was mighty impressed with this pack! I have seen all the 4 movies from this pack and will work on going over the special features discs. So far here's where I stand<br /><br />Alien - Cant believe this was made in the late 70s!!! The restoration is pristine for a movie shot in the 70s!<br />Aliens - Another fine transfer, this one has more action scenes than Alien and the special edition packed some good stuff<br />Alien 3 - Video Quality is awesome and sound is on par, the transfer was done well since this version has dark and gritty scenes it was done really well<br />Alien Resurrection - Video - 9/10, Sound 9/10<br /><br />Looking forward to the other goodies now....
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just had to come on here and praise Hugh Howey for this collection. These books have what everyone should look for in stories. The pace moves in a way that you have trouble putting the books down. The way people, the environment and conditions are described is detailed enough but allows you to create your own mental images. Most importantly the characters are easy to identify with and have a depth that isn't often seen. At times the foreshadowing is a little heavy, but there are enough surprises to make up for that. Over all, really good read and I will be recommending it to my family and friends.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|I bought this bluray to replace the previous one and boy what a difference in sound and picture quality over the previous one. This bluray has 3 editions of the movie and there were some extended scenes in the extended version with a lot of never before seen footage. I have yet to go over the other goodies but so far I give this bluray release a 5 star over the previous.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Book Two in the Trilogy - the story line gets better as you get through the books.  Book one merely sets up the reader with a lot of graphic scene setting; as you get through the other books, the plot thickens, of course there is a bad guy and a chase scene, and finally most questions are answered in the last book.
B0061Q13V2|5.0|Amazing life period , with so many struggles to deal with. An great gymnast with so many things behind the curtain. What it hit me more was the Karolys. How they manage to have their way \\"here. in America\\" was unbelievable. Dominique was able to find  her way out that ugliness and find a happy end. I love the book
B005PDJCHO|5.0|This episode had a lot of comedy to balance out the drama. It was mostly just Craig and the doctor, so if you liked them together in the lodger, you should definitely watch this one. I don't think it is absolutely essential to the plot arc. I think it is kid friendly. Of course there are scary monster bits, but it's not the same level of scary as the weeping angels.
0316123587|5.0|A great companion piece to the GLEE dvd's. If you are a fan of the show, you will want these pictures to look at the cast of your favorite show.
0920236162|5.0|This story values brain power over appearances.  I enjoy using this with children.<br />Clothes do not make a princess.  A princess can save the day. This is a good antidote to the princess culture our girls are faced with today.
B008MEM24S|5.0|agent p is a lot of fun and occasionally challenging, but could use more levels out of the box. looking forward to seeing what's next, and hopefully moving the plot forward at the end of a section.
0062206281|3.0|Disappointing third installment from a master storyteller like Ruiz Zafón of Shadow of the Wind Fame, especially after such a long wait since Angel's Game.  He still enthralls with his words and descriptions, creates suspense that keeps you turning page after page, and makes you experience the action, not just read it. For that quality of writing I must give it at least three stars, since few if any writers can approach his talent. But the plot doesn't deliver on the promise and completely fizzles out in the end. The centerpiece of the story is the description of hellish life in prison. Beyond that, it almost seems like the rest of the book revolves around Fermin's  wedding, which in the context of the series is pretty much irrelevant. Issues raised come to no resolution. Worst of all, the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, which got us hooked on these intertwined novels, is not part of the story at all, and only makes a pathetic appearance at the end. Compared to other novels, Prisoner of  Heaven may deserve more than three stars, but within the context of the series and the expectations of his readers, it's the most it deserves. Carlos Ruiz Zafón can do so much better. We're waiting.
B005MMYCY6|1.0|Foulmouth pointless piece of trash!  It had no point and no message that I see. Enough said! If you are thinking of renting/buying this movie, consider yourself warned.
030758836X|5.0|The sign that Mystery/ Thriller is doing it's job - you keep saying \\"One more chapter\\". Gillian Flynn has crafted a true \\"page turner\\". It is one of the more inventive plots I've read in the genre. The story starts on Nick and Amy Dunne's 5th wedding anniversary when Amy goes missing. The alternating narrative in the first half of the book, between Nick in the present and Amy's diary, is very effective. The characters are dark. The plot twist spin your head until the final paragraph. The writing is top notch. Ms. Flynn deserves her perch atop the NYT bestseller list. OUTSTANDING!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved this book serious.  For me it was a little slow at first but once it got going I had a very hard time putting it down.  Looking forward to starting book 6.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|I was a little skeptical, but the online reviews said it's good.  I'm here to add my voice to that chorus.  Zombie dice is fun and I think you'll like it.    What makes it fun is you actually make decisions, so while its a dice rolling game, it's not JUST the roll of the dice; you make decisions that determine your success or failure, and you can play conservatively or take more risk.    Set up: The players are all Zombies trying to eat Braaaainssss... the first to get to 13 Braaaains wins.  The dice represent human victims.  The dice have 3 symbols: Braaaaaaiinnnnns, Shotgun blasts, and feets.    Gameplay: shake the cup and draw out three dice without looking.  Roll them.  If you get Braaaainnnns, you keep them (yummy).  If you get shot gun blasts you keep those: accumulate three or roll three at once and your turn is over (I'll return to feets in a second).  You can score your Braaaaains and end your turn if you're not blasted to pieces (that is, have three shotgun blasts) or push your luck and press on.    To press on, you keep any dice with feets on them, and draw from the cup 1-3 more dice without looking at them, to make a hand of three dice (You always roll three dice).  Once you draw from the cup, you MUST roll the dice.    If you get three blasts your turn ends, but otherwise you can stop or continue after each roll and rack up your brrraaaaaaiinnnnsssss.  Once one player gets to 13 braaaaaaaaains, everyone else gets last licks.    So that's the rules, but besides the braaaainnnns thing, the game play is fun.  It just is fun.  Even my wife who was like, \\"what the hell is wrong with you?\\" enjoyed playing it.  The probability and the gambling-like rolling of dice... well, I don't have to explain why that's fun to you.  :-)    Something that adds depth is the color of the dice.  Green ones are easy targets (3 braaaaains, 2 feets, 1 shotgun).  Yellow are average folk (2 each of blasts, feets, braaaains), and red dice are bad ass (3 blasts, 2 feets, 1 braaaain).So you can guess your odds as you play and make informed decisions about your odds.  That said, it's wonderful to watch someone else get three shotgun blasts with three green dice.  HA!    At $13.13 with a very sturdy cup (that also fits 1 set of Chuthulu dice) and 13 custom made dice (yes 13 is a running joke/design element as well as the braaaainnnns thing) I think it's a good value.  It's re-playable and just plain fun.  I should add it's a quick game, maybe 10-15 mins with a crowded table, or as few as five if it's just two playing.    Here's a great review and example of play from Wil Wheaton's TableTop.  [...]    SJ Games link: [...]
B0018RE7DU|5.0|This is a classic film and introduced Richard Gere.  It is a good addition to a collection. especially if you want to see the films that introduced a person who later became well known in the acting world.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|With the latest update, I cannot adjust brightness anymore.  It states that \\"To enable display brightness, turn off the automatic brightness adjustment in display settings.\\"  When I checked the display setting, there was no auto adjusting brightness function.  I didn't have this problem with the preview version.  Not sure what to do.  I wish I could roll back.
B006UG909U|5.0|I especially love the songs that were remade from the old demos. If you are a fan of the Older Van halen stuff (not just the hits) then this if for you.
B0064T6LV8|3.0|My husband enjoyed played this on our kindle fire more than I did but its nice to know we have old games in our hands.
B00005K3OT|5.0|JUST GLORIOUS....just a lovely movie experience especially on a cold rainy day under a blanket.  Chocolat is the most decadent thing that parishioners can do during the Easter season when no member of the church is to have any pleasures: so sayeth the town's mayor (a dictator) whose wife has actually left him quietly and serenely but he just can't accept that it has really happened because he has been so devout.  Judi Dench is just so Judi and we love her as the old broad her daughter wants to put away.  However, Judi's character has other ideas: she wants to live her life to her end no matter when it comes.  Just a lovely movie venture but then you know that already by the hundreds of delightul viewers and their votes.<br />--MO
0345803485|1.0|I was mildly curious about this book since I'd heard raves about it from some people I know. My husband thought it might give us some good bedroom ideas, and he was probably also hoping it'd make me want to drag him into the bedroom hourly, so I decided to give it a try. I got through half of it before I gave up. If I had to pick one word to describe this book, it would be \\"SILLY.\\" It's poorly written with unrealistic, annoying characters and a dumb story. The only things it had going for it near the beginning of the book were some humorous lines which I enjoyed. But laughing with the book quickly turned into laughing AT the book.<br /><br />I perused the reviews here to find out if anyone else was having the same problems with the book as I was, since my impression had been that every woman on the planet loves it. I was pleasantly surprised to find about half of the readers echoing my thoughts. I noticed that the 4-5 star reviews tend to be short and shallow with many basic grammar errors, while the 1-2 star reviews tend to be articulate and detailed; a good indication that literary types tend to not like this book.<br /><br />In addition, if you thought the writing in Twilight was bad, be warned that this book makes Twilight look like Brontë by comparison! I really enjoyed Twilight (which surprised me because I'm more of a classics and fantasy person) and I wouldn't have been able to if the writing had been nearly as bad as it is in 50 Shades! One fan, upon hearing my complaints about the writing, said, \\"It's not about the writing, it's about the guilty pleasure.\\" But I can't separate the two. If I am annoyed and distracted by the terrible writing, there is no way I'm going to get any pleasure out of it. Not that I would anyway - the characters and sex are too silly.<br /><br />SILLY CHARACTERS<br /><br />Anastasia Steele (note the silly Harlequin names)<br /><br />*NOTE: Examples of everything I am about to say about Ana are on page 116 of the book, so you could save yourself some time if you want by just reading the words in italics on that page, if you can find it online. Though that page is during their first sexual encounter, so if you don't want that spoiler, just skim various pages prior to page 113 and read all the words in italics, and that will pretty much cover it.<br /><br />The heroine, Ana:<br /><br />- has the personality of a bowl of Jell-o, and just about as much brain. The book is basically her mental train of thought, and her mind is devoid of depth, eloquence or creativity. She talks, acts and thinks like a tween, not a graduating lit major. \\"Ummm,\\" \\"oh my,\\" \\"jeez,\\" \\"wow,\\" and various 4-letter words (with and without \\"holy\\" in front of them) comprise about 90% of her vocabulary. If just those phrases had been removed -- where were the EDITORS?? -- the book would have instantly improved tenfold. I was afraid that if I kept reading, my own vocabulary would shrink down to these few words. She constantly bites her lip and is extremely clumsy; both traits are in honor of Twilight's Bella, no doubt... but compared to Ana, Bella has the verbal range of Shakespeare.<br /><br />- refers to her inner thoughts as her 'subconscious' or her 'inner goddess,' as if she has two little people inside her mind speaking to her, dancing in various styles (such as salsa), and gesturing. One can't be consciously aware of one's 'subconscious' mind; that's a contradiction. And the whole 'inner goddess' thing is super-annoying.<br /><br />- has no self-esteem whatsoever, if her own thoughts are to be believed. Yet she is in reality apparently gorgeous, and even though she idolizes him, sometimes she musters enough gumption to rebel against Christian's \\"Dominant\\" personality and rules.<br /><br />- does not own a computer or have an email address. Christian gives her a computer so she can research BDSM and email him, and she's unduly excited about his emails. I am not kidding, this is what she says during their first email conversation: \\"Christian Grey just sent me a winking smiley... Oh my.\\" And this is AFTER they've had sex. No wonder Christian's attracted to her; she acts like a child and he needs someone he can 'father.'<br /><br />- is a virgin who has never been drunk, never masturbated or been attracted to a man in her 22 years of life. She refers to her genitalia as \\"down there\\" or \\"way down there\\" or \\"deep down\\" or her \\"sex.\\" During her first time, with Christian, she is worried that his \\"considerable length\\" won't fit. She missed her true calling as a nun.<br /><br />Christian Grey:<br /><br />- is young, insanely rich, beautiful, talented and a near-unmitigated a-hole. He is a weird mix of cold businessman, psychotic stalker and sweet gentleman.<br /><br />- insists on being called \\"Mr. Grey,\\" and calls Ana \\"Miss Steele\\" most of the time.<br /><br />- stalks Ana from the outset, tracking down all her personal info, finding her workplace, finding her after she calls him from an unknown locale, etc.<br /><br />- can only relate to women as \\"submissives\\". He wants to own, not love, women.<br /><br />- is averse to being touched<br /><br />- is extremely possessive and jealous<br /><br />- orders Ana to clean her plate, get enough sleep, and other bizarre fatherly things.<br /><br />- says, \\"Come, Ana\\" - sometimes meaning \\"come over here,\\" sometimes meaning \\"climax\\" - on almost every page. Like she's a dog. He also says, \\"Eat, Ana\\" a lot. Maybe \\"Sit, Ana\\" is in there too.<br /><br />- declares to Ana during their first coitus, \\"You are mine.\\" So one date makes her his property. Wonderful.<br /><br />And this is all just a few days after meeting her and BEFORE Ana signs the contract officially making her his \\"Submissive.\\" Both the reader and Ana are expected to be intrigued by him and all his mysteries, and forgive his sociopathic behavior because it's hinted that it stems from a messed up childhood. And I expect that at some point in the trilogy he will change for Ana's sake and be just what she needs, if the small concessions he makes in this book are any indication. Realistic? No. Intriguing? Maybe, if I could get past the bad writing.<br /><br />Update: after watching hilarious YT video summaries of the books by hollishillis, I now know that all of the above traits of a domestic abuser get exponentially worse in the second book, and two insane ex-girlfriends start stalking Ana as well. But she doesn't get fed up and go to the Feds for an identity change... no, she loves Christian too much for that. How romantic!<br /><br />SILLY SEX<br /><br />- The first sensual scene starts on page 25, when he mysteriously appears at the hardware store where she works. It's their second time meeting, and they basically have sex with their eyes while picking out home repair products. They talk in bedroom voices about home improvement items. His every word is laced with double meaning. She repeatedly notes his long fingers, from which she has to look away as he runs them over the various types of tape. It goes something like this - a loose paraphrase - ' \\"What about some masking tape?\\" he murmurs with dark, intense eyes. \\"Ummm... okay,\\" I whisper breathlessly. \\"Holy double crap!!\\" my inner goddess says while doing a salsa dance.' When a male co-worker comes over to greet her, Christian glowers at him darkly and I'm surprised he doesn't challenge the poor guy to a duel.<br /><br />- There is way more gasping than occurs in real life other than during underwater breath training. They are constantly gasping at silly things, such as Christian gasping when she smiles or wears his underwear... Christian, a highly experienced man who has had kinky relations with over 15 beautiful women. Riiiiight.<br /><br />- Christian speaks in murmurs, and Ana in mutters and whispers, seemingly most of the time. I guess this is supposed to be enticing. If it happened far less frequently, maybe it would be. They're going to have to turn the mikes up REALLY loud for the movie.<br /><br />- I was already fed up with the book by the end of chapter 3, but decided to at least read through to their first sexual encounter. It didn't improve my opinion. (Look up \\"drunken 50\\" on YT for a hysterical reading of this scene!) Christian consents to do what he calls 'vanilla' (non-BDSM) sex for Ana's deflowering session. Her extremely easy multiple orgasms are described like a Mortal Kombat game: the first one involves Ana's body \\"shattering into a thousand pieces,\\" and the second, on the very next page, is, \\"I unravel at his words, exploding around him as I climax and splinter into a million pieces.\\" Really creative writing there.<br /><br />- Every time it almost gets interesting, the author inserts an \\"oh my\\" into Ana's train of thought and it completely derails the whole scene. I then feel as though I'm reading about a nice old lady's sexual experience.<br /><br />- She says \\"Aaaargh\\" while orgasming. I thought that was what you say when you're really annoyed, or a pirate.<br /><br />- There are the silliest analogies I have ever heard for sexual acts. She compares her first orgasms as \\"coming apart at the seams, like the spin cycle on a washing machine, wow.\\" (What does that even mean??). Christian's member during oral sex is \\"my own personal Christian Grey-flavored popsicle.\\"<br /><br />- The cumulative effect of all the silliness was that I felt nothing at all. I would have thought that even a badly written sex scene would elicit some physical feelings, but the ones I read in this book did not -- pretty much negating what I presume to be the main purpose of the book. (Oddly enough, Twilight seemed much more erotic, even though there were no sex scenes.) I stopped at the end of chapter 12; I didn't see the point of continuing since the only effect the book was having on me was annoyance.<br /><br />So there you have it.... my take on the first half of this book. Skimming quickly through the rest, and reading some of the negative reviews, indicated to me that it does not improve. This did help my marriage in one way: on a long car trip, we cracked up for a while as I read to him some of the highly creative 1-star reviews (which point out even more writing problems that I didn't cover above).

034580404X|5.0|We got the books very timely, ahead of the date that was given for the delivery estimate.  the books were perfectly new looking and exactly what I wanted to get for my hubby.  he loves the books and has already read the first book and on to the next one.  Amazon.com is an awesome place to get books from and the best place to shop for almost anything.  thank you for your service and for the timely arrival to our home.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|It was entertaining, provocative, well written and encouraged me to conduct research beyond the book itself.  I bought two additional books as a result of reading it.

He shares so many wonderful stories about him and his running that helps all of us to understand simplicity of life and running.He is one of the best ultra runner.

It is  not only for runners but for everyone.I highly recommend this book to all.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Fun, more advanced city game then the ones I am used to. My only complaint is that you have to use invest points to expand.
B008JAGZDE|4.0|I have to agree with most of the other reviews.  If you've seen and liked the original American Pie movie, you will like this sequel too.  The first 2 sequels were okay, but like most sequels, they never quite live up to the original.  Third time's the charm I guess.  I think there's room for 1 final sequel in this franchise, when Jim's son is a high school senior and we start the cycle over again.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|This series of books was not worth the hype the media has given to them.  Sorry I wasted my time and money.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I bought this series because so many women I knew were talking about it. So, I read the reviews and I am so glad I ignored them. This was not the best written book I have. It was so much more Han what the reviewers were saying. It's a love story and that's what I loved about this series, I couldn't put them done. I read them twice and would love to read them from his point of view!

0743289692|5.0|From reading this book, it is clear to me that the thing about Ayaan, is that when she sees suffering, and she has a chance to try to alleviate it, she will not turn away.<br />Surely that is the most pure and 'religious' attitude of all?<br />It is also so interesting to read about a young girl who follows her heart or 'soul', and takes leaps into the unknown, rather than living a half life.<br />Good for you Ayaan, I'll be recommending your book to others!

B002BE7JEI|2.0|HUGE comedown from the book. You'll hardly recognize it.<br /><br />I'm an RN who could kiss Stephen King for bringing public attention to the very real problem of evil-sometimes killer- nurses, who are either sociopathic or narcotic addicted, and still working in healthcare.Still,the movie is soooo disappointing. There are several parts that don't add up but James Caan's Golden Razzie-worthy performance is what completely ruins it.<br /><br />Bates nails it in one scene, as she depicts how someone with Anti-Social Personality Disorder thinks while they commit a pre-meditated, violent crime.(Anti Social Personality Disorder is better known as \\"sociopath\\" and \\"psychopath\\".) Yet, it annoys me that so many people who saw the movie are surprised and wide-eyed by the fact that a true sociopath would look just like you and I, and would act like everything was normal as s/he performed the most evil deeds imaginable.Repulsed by the things Annie did to her victim,yes.Definitely.But IMHO it shouldn't SURPRISE people. That's what ASPDs/sociopaths/psychopaths-whatever you call them-can really do. That's what people who abuse enough narcotics can do. Apparently a lot of people need to wake up and smell the coffee: \\"People\\" completely devoid of a conscience, who could sleep like a baby and expect the victim to be their friend after doing what Annie Wilkes did, are everywhere in society.They don't all attack people with axes or mallets but if they did they'd never feel a shred of guilt or concern for the victim.It wouldn't faze them to ruin your life for giving them a funny look. They've just learned to try to hide the way they're really wired. If you haven't seen them you should have because they've seen you.There's probably one on your block and one in your workplace. But I digress... :) Bates' portrayal of how a true sociopath can act was excellent, but she was disappointing in other scenes. If Annie Wilkes is a narcotics abuser, in many ways Bates looks and acts NOTHING like the real thing. When the man she's smitten and obsessed with asks her to have dinner with him, what woman answers in a monotone? LOL<br /><br />I didn't expect all of the mind games and psychological warfare that goes on between the hero and villain in the book to be communicated in the movie but was disappointed that more of it wasn't. I thought that was the main point of the story. Silly me.<br /><br />In the book we get to know Paul Sheldon, the hero, intimately. We also learn the complex ways Annie Wilkes(Bates), the villain, operates. Sheldon is a well-known writer. Wilkes is an extremely disturbed and evil fan who is obsessed with Sheldon and has been stalking him. When he's in a car crash she kidnaps him from the site and takes him to a deserted house. In the book we learn the way Sheldon handles crises, his past successes and failures, his admirable and annoying traits. In the book he's so real that it felt like really being there. And in the book King is brilliant as he takes Sheldon through the whole gamut of emotions we would expect from someone who's been in a serious car crash, kidnapped from the crash while critically injured, and held prisoner by someone who verbally, physically, and psychologically tortures them in isolation for six months. Where was ANY of that in the movie? Again, I thought the whole story was supposed to be about a villain who is an evil genius and her kidnapped victim who is SO intelligent and able to hold it together that he has a chance, even though the odds are greatly stacked against him.<br /><br />Instead of portraying that, Caan acts like he thought he was supposed to be portraying Wile E. Coyote. In one scene where the villain horribly abuses and tortures him, Caan writhes and yells twice and then voila! Half a minute later he's good as new a la your favorite cartoon character. He didn't even break a sweat! In another Annie Wilkes forces him to destroy the manuscript that he had worked on for years and was his pride and joy, AND was not yet in writing anywhere else. Caan questions her once. When she insists he kind of sticks out his lip and looks a little bit miffed and pouty for a few seconds. That's it? I don't THINK so, James.<br /><br />Near the end Caan needs a bath and some clean clothes but otherwise looks like he just got back from a spa! Miraculously his emotions are still rock solid.(Uh Huh. Riiight.)That's fortunate because he needs to make a nervy and dramatic escape attempt or be murdered by the villain. I think he creases his brow once during his escape attempt. If his hair moved at all it wasn't much. Between you and I, he didn't look like he'd missed many meals during his captivity. Whatever.<br /><br />There's still another scene at the very end that's bogus as it can be and an insult to people who've really lived through a certain medical problem. I won't tell you the ending but my advice is to read the book and skip the movie.<br /><br />To see a performance by Bates that's excellent through the whole movie, I recommend \\"Fried Green Tomatoes.\\" To see a good one  by Caan, I recommend \\"The Godfather.\\" If you want to read about real-life versions of Annie Wilkes I recommend \\"Nurses Who Kill\\" by Clifford Linedecker and William A. Burt.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|This is a must see for sci-fi fans. There are some scientific inaccuracies like when Cob says that we use only 20% of our brain. This is a popular myth started back in the 70s. All animals use 100% of their brain all the time just like all our other organs; humans are animals so therefore the same applies to us. Other than that,it was an incredible movie. Twists and turns, nail bitters, thrills, action etc. Everything a good movies needs. And the ending will blow your mind !<br /><br />The cast is excellent as well. Leo and Ellen Page are the best!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is exciting with every turn jump or slide. It is a very addictive game so don't let it overcome you.
0446585025|1.0|Love Ellen, watch her show often.It seems her humour doesn't translate well on paper, there's a few good one liners but mostly obscure rambling about odd subjects. Would have been upset if I had paid for this book.For example, \\"Portia loves hand lotion. She once put too much on and got stuck in the bathroom for an hour trying to turn the doorknob. Then I had to remind her we have a door that slides.\\"<br />If you find that funny, you will love this book.Don't think this book would have made it to publishing if it had been anyone else, I think it was riding on her name.
B000MRA6AK|5.0|There is very little to say except that this trio was unsurpassed in Jazz recorded history. The spiritual connection, the virtuosity, the oneness of sound and execution, is all amazing. This was witnessing telepathy at work. They anticipated each other's every nuance. I am very sorry but Bill Evan's trio did not duplicate what this trio accomplished. Firstly, Paul Motian was not in Vernell Fournier's league. Secondly, Scott LaFaro was not Israel Crosby. And as much as Evans adored and respected Ahmad, alas Ahmad he was not. Now back to the show.<br /><br />The virtuosity of Errol Garner's trios, Oscar Peterson and Ray Brown's trio, of course we will acquiesce. But there is something magical about this trio. It's erudite without being grandiloquent. It's high brow without being obtuse. It swings like Aunt Safronia's broken down back yard country gate! It makes you do the Moobie Foobie and the Backwards Slop simutaneously while you're doing the Mashed Potato and Funky Doo Hissy!<br /><br />And Poinciana, good gravy! This thing is so infectuous it makes you continue to chase your hindparts around the room trying to catch it! The music actually dislodged it from your body and it just started dancing and shaking and partying to its hearts delight. Somebody call the police! This is against the law! This music is sooooo wholesome and complete. It's extremely dumbfounding in it's simplicity. The complexity is so intricately weaved and well hidden, you are actually fooled into believing it's not there! This is truly a salubrious experience.<br /><br />It's not one element or musician, its the whole sum of it's parts. It is absolutely imperative though to understand that its Vernell Fournier who is responsible for the music going to the stratosphere. He along with Billy Higgins was the most sensitive and multifacited drummer in our history. Who else played like this? No one.<br /><br />What made Lorez Alexandria's \\"Deep Roots\\" LP so cohesively tight, spectacular, brilliantlyexecuted and a true masterpiece was the inclusion of VERNELL FOURNIER AND ISRAEL CROSBY. The magnificent and underrated majestic brilliance of fellow Chicago pianist John Young was pushed to ionospheric heights by having Ahmad's rhythm section on loan to him. (He along with King Fleming,Ramsey Lewis and Ahmad were the Chicago Formidable Four of pianists). The environment was so inspiring, sensational and propulsive it made John play and Lorez sing like they had never played or sung before. And we all know that John ALWAYS PLAYED and Lorez ALWAYS SANG! Not like this. Vernell playing John's arrangement of Nature Boy for Lorez in 5/4 skyrocketed that tune to the cosmos and made it PURE JAZZ! He challenged her, she lived up to it and together they produced the definitive version of this much recorded tune. UNBELIEVABLE!<br /><br />As far as the sound on the CD having some hiss, excuse me! This is remastered from analogue tapes people! Hiss was part and parcel of the environment. Its not overwhelming or pervasive, as a matter of fact I really didn't pay it any mind. I was too busy having too much fun! I think Gambit did a remarkable job. You can hear all of Vernell's drums. Hi hat, brushes, the most intimate inflections. Israel's bass is right in the same room with you, booming and doing precise pirouettes stopping on a dime! Ahmad's piano is crystal clear and all around you. Sounding like sparkling diamonds being strewn everywhere. I think they are to be commended. I don't know how it measures up to the Mosaic releases but I do plan to find out. Oh yes, I will indeed buy it all over again. This is pure magic.
B00004R95G|1.0|I was ecstatic to find the DVD of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat available at Amazon.  However, when our granddaughter was ready to watch it--and its her favorite musical--the DVD was not formatted to play in our area of the world.  Since I had purchased it from an \\"in country\\" dealer, I didn't think there would be any problem. So now I will hesitate to buy ANY DVD from Amazon. (Actually, I didn't even know that DVDs could be improperly formatted, so I hope this helps others that are unaware of that technicality!)<br /><br />As for the musical itself, we LOVE the music and I especially like the bonus trailers about the history of how Joseph was written and how it has evolved. So it is a HUGE disappointment to not be able to view this DVD!

034580404X|2.0|This is nothing more than a bad soap opera plot.  The sex (which everyone raved about) was dull and far and few between scenes.  With all the hype that came with this book I expected so much more.  E.L. James used the same phrases over and over...boring.  How many times can a character \\"look up through her lashes\\"?  How many times can a character \\"cock their head to the side\\".  The most ridiculous term in the entire book was having the character of Ana Steele calling her vagina her \\"sex\\"!!  What's up with that?  I've never her any woman call their vagina her sex.  I cringed every time that \\"label\\" was used in the book. The success of this book has to be from all the media hype because as a book this is a very weak effort.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I really like the game.  It's the ads for new puzzles that is aggravating.  It took forever to get wild horses ans am still waiting for. bridges and lighthouses.  I have bought a lot of puzzles and don't want that to be a loss.  I've. had no problems with the game running or crashing.
B003XU02QG|4.0|Nuff said. Great story & suspense. Well worth my time to see this.  This was a good way to pass the time on a summer evening.
B005ISQ7JM|1.0|Even thought this book is free, it's probably not worth your time to read it. It's just got a lot of rambling with some sparse content interspersed.  A list of new tags with one paragraph descriptions would really more than adequately cover everything this book does.

B005LAIGOQ|2.0|Having read Susan Hill's sinister and chilling tale a number of times, I had high hopes for this screen adaptation. And boy did it look good - the opening sequence, where innocent child play quite seamlessly flows into a precisely choreographed triple suicide, seemed promising enough. But from then on, I was sorely let down, or rather, irritated and annoyed with what I forced myself to watch.<br /><br />It is a valid question whether or not Hill's story has the potential to be made into anything that could satisfy the standards expected by moviegoers of today; while relying mainly on atmosphere and the building effects of oppressive settings/landscapes, the plot is simple, with maybe just too little action to be found. So the temptation to make it \\"bigger\\" must certainly be there. Now changing a few details isn't necessarily a crime (I did like the parrot!), as long as the original mood and structure is retained - but here's where the filmmakers fall pitifully short. There's no exposition to speak of; the protagonist's life context, i.e., family and work, is rushed through in a couple of seconds. No chance of getting a real sense of place either. The crucial funeral/church scene is dropped and we are plunged almost head-on into the house, where the mystery (even though not a great one to begin with) is revealed practically at once. To avoid spoilers I won't describe all the devious and near-ridiculous plot additions, including the attempt to make the progagonist a tragic hero, and - worst of all - an incredibly kitschy, Hollywood-inspired ending. See for yourself, if you dare...<br /><br />It's not, however, the misbegotten script's fault alone. As remarked in another review, the settings have an artificial look about them and they are far too dark as well, with the house almost turned into some gloomy vampire castle, boasting a collection of mechanical toys that rivals the one in Joseph L. Mankiewicz's \\"Sleuth\\", ready to steal any ghost's show - in fact that's exactly what they do. And then it must be Daniel Radcliffe of all actors, who's bound to draw pointless Potter references by the thousands. He's not too bad though: if acting means putting on a grief-stricken look on your face and keeping it there for 90+ minutes, he succeeds.<br /><br />Notwithstanding a much lower budget and complete absence of digital effects, Herbert Wise did quite an impressive job with his 1989 \\"daylight\\" TV version (it's not perfect, the woman herself being the problem); he wouldn't even spare us the \\"evil\\" ending (although again slightly changed), which is disturbing in the extreme, but consistent with the story. An ending apparently too hard on audiences of today. - Who then is expected to believe that the book's author actually approved of this concoction? Probably she had no choice.<br /><br />For those familiar with the novel this film is simply unbearable; and for those who aren't, even taken as standard horror fare it should be disappointing, given the chain of stereotypes presented. That bit of period feel just can't be enough.<br /><br />While England is god's chosen country of spooks without a doubt, there'll always be exceptions: see F.A. Bayona and his 2007 \\"El Orfanato\\". The Spanish know how to do better these days.tly what they do.

B0011KQSZ4|5.0|The film centers around a seemingly ordinary funeral in England. Turns out to be anything but ordinary - thanks to LSD being confused with Valium in several instances, a crotchety uncle in a wheelchair, an unexpected 'guest' who shows up with homosexual photos of himself and the deceased - attempting blackmail, an insecure novelist wannabe, a Deacon in a hurry, etc. All plausible scenarios, all well-acted. Everything works out in the end, except of course the deceased is still dead.

B008BM9L72|1.0|I decided to read this book just to see what all the fuss is about, and apart from the raunchy subject matter, I'm still wondering what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />It is very poorly written, with the author using the same few descriptive phrases over and over again, to the point where I new what was about to be said before reading it.  The author clearly has a limited command of the English language.  The plot was also entirely predictable with not one single twist, shock or page-turning element of suspense.  The hero was rich and handsome with baggage and issues that gradually get dealt with through the series until life is once again perfect.  The heroine is an unrealized beauty who bags the rich, handsome guy and gradually helps him deal with his baggage and issues throughout the series until life is once again perfect.  There are some bad guys who want to do the rich, handsome guy and his unrealized beauty of a girlfriend harm, but the heroine of course fights them off.<br /><br />Yes it was raunchy, containing explicit scenes regarding what I guess is a relatively taboo lifestyle, but even those scenes got boring and predictable after a while.  I found myself skipping the explicit scenes, because I was so sick of reading about how he was going to touch her \\"there\\" (Really?  That was the best term you could come up with?), and how every scene ended in a mind-blowing fashion.  I mean, come-on, really?<br /><br />This is no more than a trashy Mills & Boon style romance, albeit a steroid induced, completely over the top version of one.  Don't bother - wish I hadn't.  Want my money back.

0385751532|5.0|I kept hearing about this book, and the subsequent movie that it was made into, so I made a point of picking it up recently. I really enjoy teen novels, and for the most part, this was no exception. Parts of it are a little clumsy, perhaps owing to the fact that author John Boyne wrote the book in a matter of days. Despite the fact that a couple of extra weeks of fine-tuning might have been helpful, I would definitely recommend this book.<br /><br />Told through the childish eyes of 9-year-old Bruno, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is the story of Nazi Germany and the Holocaust. Bruno is the child of a Nazi Commander whose position has been transferred to Auschwitz. The family leaves their beloved home in Berlin to live in a desolate house with a long fence in the back yard that Bruno has been told to never go near. Loneliness overcomes him, and he heads off in search of adventure - successfully. A long way down the fence, Bruno meets Schmuel, a boy who lives on the other side. An unlikely friendship develops between the two, leading to an ending that caught me off-guard.<br /><br />Bruno's naivety at times seems unbelievable; he doesn't know what a Jew is, is unfamiliar with Hitler, and calls Auschwitz \\"Out-With.\\" While there has been controversy over the book due to both this naivety as well as certain other historical inaccuracies, it is still an interesting (though certainly fictional) view into the lives of children, both Jewish and not, living during that Nazi regime.

Being that i have recently become a big fan of Kiss well Kiss: Ikons was a good start for me. I also recently bought Lick It Up and Asylum CDs and those are just the beginning for me. So this is a good starter for a newbie or someone who wants to get more into their music like I did. I gave this 4 stars. It is pretty cool. Hey it is still Kiss music though, right? I wanna hear it Loud & On The 8th Day a couple other songs they could have added. But as I said the music is still by KISS
0345495004|5.0|Last spring, my husband and I took a trip to Chicago to visit some old friends. With so much to see in and around the city, and five people with different opinions on where to go, it was difficult to narrow down our options on what to do. One thing all of us agreed on, though, was that we had to visit the Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio in Oak Park, Illinois, a short drive from Chicago. I was completely inspired by being inside Wright's home and seeing firsthand how he allowed nature to help dictate his design aesthetic.<br /><br />Also on the tour was a book club group who had just finished reading Nancy Horan's then brand new book, Loving Frank. Although the tour guide emphasized that this is absolutely a work of fiction and recommended other books on Wright that are more historically accurate, my interest was piqued.<br /><br />Loving Frank is the story of Frank Lloyd Wright's life told from the point of view of his lover, Mamah Borthwick Cheney. Wright's genius and his narcissism are carefully developed throughout the story, giving a portrayal of both his strengths and his weaknesses as an architect, husband, father, and man. Although developed in the media as little more than a scandal, Horan weaves a love story between Wright and Mamah leading to their eventual flight from Chicago to avoid persecution and to allow Wright to design and build a new home in the plains of Wisconsin.<br /><br />The story led me to develop an interest in Frank Lloyd Wright, so I followed it up with several non-fiction titles to learn more about the \\"official\\" story of his life and work.<br /><br />For a first novel, especially, Horan's book is a must read.

I've gotten some compliments, but nothing out of this world.  My experience is that it can be worn daily, to the office and keeps accurate time.  The face of the watch is large, but not chunky or overly showy.  The band is a nice combo brushed-polished steel which makes it faintly understated - I appreciate that.  It wears comfortably but is a metal band so if you're not used to that, it is a bit of a switch from leather.  I will say that the band itself feels a bit lighter than I'm used to if they cut corners on materials, it's here.  The glow feature is nice but not annoying.  Works well when you first walk into a dark house.<br /><br />The chronograph is odd.  I'm not experienced with them but:  The hour chrono is timed to the actual hour (on a 24 hour scale) and not actually part of the Chronograph itself.  The Second and minute chronos appear to function normally.  They're not spectacularly accurate, but I've got a digital watch for that.<br /><br />The watch keeps time and I think the manual does a decent job of explaining how to set it and use it.<br /><br />My complaints include the band, which I think feels a little less expensive then some of my other watches, but not so much that it feels cheap.  Just lighter links than expected.  Additionally, the pins were impossible to move and I had to go to a watch shop to resize.<br /><br />Overall, for a sub $100 price, you get a great looking time piece that can be worn in the office without mocking.  I wouldn't pay anything close to MSRP, but if you're in this level of price, you won't be disappointed.
B0062P3392|5.0|Great vehicle for both Jason Statham and Robert De niro  .<br /><br />Another action packed movie that is not to be missed!

034580404X|4.0|Wanted to read the book(s) that everyone was gossiping about and so I ordered from Amazon since I couldn't find them in the stores.  Ordered them and got them in a very timely manner.  Have started to read the books and now I know what all the gossip is about!  Great book so far finish one and on my way to the second book.  I don't have much time to read and usually don't read much other than magazines but so far this series of books seem to be one of those that when you get started reading it is very hard to put down, stayed up late several nights now to get to a point where I could stop.  Good reading and good writing! [[ASIN:034580404X Fifty Shades Trilogy: Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker, Fifty Shades Freed 3-volume Boxed Set]].
0439023521|5.0|Okay, so, this is officially considered a Young Adult book, but don't let that hinder you in any way from reading it. The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic setting made up of the Capital and its twelve territories. As punishment for a war in which the territories came out as losers, each territory must provide two \\"tributes,\\" (one male and one female child each) to compete in a Gladiator-style game; a fight to the death for all but one of the tributes. The games are watched avidly by all; for the Capital (which is not required to provide tributes) they're a fun diversion, but in the territories families live in fear of losing their children to the annual event. Sound twisted? It is.<br /><br />When her younger sister, who she adores, is selected to be the female tribute for District 12, Katniss immediately steps in to take her place in the games. Katniss and Peeta, her male counterpart, are immediately caught up in the whirlwind festivities of the games; cameras, make-up, interviews, and costume changes galore. Reality sets in, however, as soon as the 24 tributes are dropped into the playing field; an enclosed world created specifically for the games and filled with unknown threats.<br /><br />I don't want to give any spoilers here, so I'll stop with my description, but suffice to say this book will keep you on the edge of your seat. And you don't have to be sad when it's over - there's two more after!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I can add notes from PC Kindle and phone. I plan my day. Keep my food journal. It helps me stay focused and motivated.
B001QB9H10|5.0|No slowing down for Jason Statham, and I am glad.  I am ready for a transporter 4.<br />I love the fact that Francois Berleand was back.  I didn't care for the interaction between Jason and Natalya Rudakova.  It just didn't seem right...<br /><br />The movie was filled to the rim with action and Jason always looks great!

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evermore is awesome tool to replace or add too journeling on paper. A cool feature I would like to see is a printable journel.
B005LAIHHC|3.0|Sacha Cohen is probably too recognizable to get away with the unscripted bits that fueled his characters on Da Ali G Show any longer, which is a pity because those provided the fodder for most of his best bits. He gets by okay in The Dictator, his first starring vehicle without any such scenes, but also feels more homogenized and common than ever before. It's an intentionally crass, stupid film that leaves no culture un-mocked and no softball un-smacked. That's not to say it isn't funny, because it is - I averaged a legitimate laugh every five minutes, which is far better than the modern average - but it's missing the sharp-edged points that helped his previous films transcend generic comedy. Borat was as much about cultural disconnect as it was naked men wrestling in a hotel lobby, and Bruno used its explicit shocks to challenge homophobia at large. Despite a hammy attempt to shoulder in a deeper message about modern democracy, The Dictator has nothing even remotely intelligent to say. Take that for what you will; there's still a place in film for plain, dumb laughs, but I was hoping for something more unique considering Cohen's track record.
B0019EXZY4|5.0|When I first thought about watching this this movie, I thought this could be like any other bank robbery/crime drama movie, But after watching the movie, I realized it was about so much more. I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br /> This movie was actually inspired by true events.  A bank in London was  robbed in 1971 .
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is fun and relaxing.  easy rewards....easy money.....fun fun fun...great way to end a long day.I grab my kindle fire and play away.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very addictive but challenging... some of the games that require you to drag your finger on the screen are harder because your finger develops friction so its not a smooth glide for long.
0345803485|1.0|Cannot believe all the excitement about this book on the talk shows.  Clearly the hosts have not read it.  It did not keep my interest at all.  Nothing seemed realistic in it, not the characters, not the sexual encounters.  Nothing made sense.  I kept thinking this must get better, but it didn't.  At the halfway point I had to stop, could not take any more.
B005LAIIS0|4.0|A harsh, bitter, introspective survival picture that wasn't at all what I expected from the trailers. What the film chooses to do, it does very well - the suspense is so thick that my neck muscles remained in a stiff vice grip for hours, and the constant landscape shots are awe-inspiring - but those wildly successful qualities come at the expense of others. It's not a story with a firm resolution, which is sure to polarize a lot of viewers, and most of its intentions are left ambiguous. Liam Neeson is his typical commanding, badass self, but despite a few action hero moments he makes some boneheaded mistakes and his leadership qualities leave a lot to be desired. I've read that the plot is a metaphor for existentialism, which makes plenty of sense in reflection, but in the heat of the moment it feels desolate and hopeless. That innate duality makes it a complicated picture to rate; I wasn't oblivious to its faults, but still found it a dense, intriguing and enveloping experience. Worth watching, even if you wind up hating it.
0439023491|1.0|The first book was engrossing, once you got over the 100 or so pages of introductory cosmetology. The second book, however, is much more satisfying when used to clean your posterior after elimination. In fact, my doctor concurred with this assessment. Please note that I have paperback edition. I think the author should be placed in a real hunger games, and only given wax hair removal kits and cosmetics for survival. THAT would be a satisfying follow-up to the first book.
B002EBDP9G|5.0|This was my first book buying for my iPad and I don't regret buying it, I didn't have to worry if I had my book when I went to work or if I was out just want to do some reading, I was able to google information and able highlight take notes on the book without having any paper.
0312323867|4.0|Her story telling skills and lines are full and makes you viewer of the story unfolding in front of you.  It's a great and easy read...
0670022411|3.0|I actually read this after I saw on NPR that the sequel was an anticipated summer read. I should say I listened to the audiobook. I enjoy the topic,  it is one of my favorites for listening to at the gym. The plot was a bit predictable, a scholarly woman with unruly hair who meets a handsome dark vampire. I thought an incredible amount of time was spent on describing the food and wine in the book. Diana's character does get weaker once she meets the vampire Matthew and you never really buy that she is a strong independent woman. If you enjoy the genre give it a go, if not, pass it up.
B0086700CM|5.0|I was looking around for some games so that I wouldn't get bored on the plane trip that I was going on. I was desperate, so I did random games that I saw. I did not open this game until one of my friends told me its fun. it works great on my kindle fire, and its free! its harder to play on a kindle fire than an ipod touch because the screens bigger... but its great for a free app! I highly reccomend it.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|After having read Wuthering Heights, I watched the movie. Although the movie was really good for a classic black and white, I must say that the book (like a lot of other book-based movies) was better than the movie. However, the movie did follow the storyline fairly well, unlike most other books. Furthermore, as somber a setting that this book outlines, it is a classic that I will read again. I loved the story, and definitely would suggest this as an educational literature piece.
B004HO6I4W|4.0|I bought this for my grandkids and the oldest one has a tablet and Dad is having a problem loading the digital copy ,,,, other than that I am very pleased with my purchase.  Thank You!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Not well written, the lead characters were seriously unlikeable.  The male lead was abusive, and the female lead extremely dependent on his view of her.  I got through a couple of chapters and decided that I was wasting my time.  ONE of two books that I never finished.
B005PK553C|5.0|I truly enjoyed watching this series.  Hope there is a Season 2.  I believe Jessica Lange received an Emmy and/or Golden Globe award for her performances in this series.  If so, the award(s) were well deserved.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this series!!!!!!  I didn't think that I would like reading on my Kindle Fire, but after the first chapter I couldn't put it down.  This is definitely a series that young women and men over the age 18 should read.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like playing it, it's a really fun game and the app is good, like the format, it's a great free app and I think it's the best Solitaire app I've found and like i said it's free
B007SGM084|5.0|I don't care what anyone says... THESE ARE THE BOOKS TO READ!  I loved the entire series!  I read it twice.  Right in a row!  Do not miss out on these books.  Racey but not too bad!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Well, I did finish this book.  And I started reading the 2nd one...so I have to say that it wasn't so terrible that I couldn't finish it.  I did want to know what happens next.  I guess.  Plus, I wanted to know if it ever got better.<br />It did not.<br />The main character has no personality whatsoever aside from being continually flustered over nothing.  And yet this incredibly handsome megajillionaire falls in love with her at first sight.  If you can believe that, then you must struggle through the comically stupid and repetitive writing.  I flushed, I blushed, his lips were a hard line, I peeked at him through my eyelashes - seriously, she frequently peeks at him through her eyelashes.  I've tried to look through my eyelashes, it doesn't work but I can see it will give you a headache if you try hard enough.  She also whispers a lot.  He frowns and scowls.  I shouldn't be writing this review because I found this book so annoying, and there are so many good one star reviews out there.  Actually, keep reading the reviews, some of them are pretty well-written and entertaining.  Similar to what a novel should be, hint hint.<br />One final tip - get a Kindle and get this from the library.  Don't worry if you're 10,351 on the waiting list - trust me whan I say you're not in any hurry to read it.
B007ELN8Y8|3.0|Yes, there have not been many recent general release, major motion pictures shot in black and white lately but the story seemed like a luke warm remake of \\"A Star is Born.\\"  I do not believe it lives up to all the acclaim it has received and was rather disappointed.
B005ZUR724|5.0|love it! I loved Wow form the moment I started playing this is becoming a fast 2nd! cant wait to see what the updates bring! just wish the camaraderie would adjust itself!
B008NEMN0K|5.0|My review is going to be short and sweet. I think this is one of the best movies of the 21st century. I see that they are going to try and make it 3-D. The only things that I have to say is that I hope they took their time changing it over and it's not riddled with ghosting problems. I have a feeling that a lot more movies like this one are going to become 3-D and I hope they do them right. To me, there's nothing worse than taking a movie that is already a blockbuster hit and turning into a 3-D flop. I've got my fingers crossed.<br /><br />Sorry that I didn't specify which version I gave the 5 stars to. I gave the 5 stars to the Non 3-D version. I will update my review once I have seen the 3-D version.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this book.  I cannot say enough good things about this read.  I really enjoyed it!  Cannot wait for the next in series!
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Worth reading.  Definite eye opener for the imagination!  Ensure you have time to read it cover to cover before starting, you won't want to put it down...
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Another roller-coaster. I swear all these ladies are trying to prove that my heart is<br />not really an icicle frozen in my chest. Well, here it is-- warm and beating and...<br /><br />Yeah, I still feel all the feelings.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I am so glad that this book was on my list of suggestions. I am even happier I took a chance on it. I laughed, I cried and I laughed some more and I cried some more. This is one very good book. I loved the ups and downs I went on with these characters. They were easy to fall in love with and connect with. Not overdone at all. \\"You can keep your ocean, I'll keep the Lake\\". Read this book because you need a good belly laugh. Read this book because you need a good deep in your heart cry. READ THIS BOOK!
0316010669|3.0|The idea behind the book was very interesting up front and I was very much engaged for about the first 100-150 pages. What I started to realize as the book went on though is that the stories started to irritate the heck out of me. Gladwell probably spent 5-10% of the book providing useless background on what the people he interviewed looked like. This doesn't pertain to the key takeaways of the book and I found it to be a waste of my time to 'sort of' know what some guy he interviewed looked like. As I've seen noted in other reviews, this book is supposed to be a 'fun' and 'interesting' read more so than it is just to tell you the results of some analysis. This is likely why there's a lot of additional unnecessary background provided.  This is also the reason I gave the book a solid 3 stars as opposed to only 2.<br /><br />All in all the ideas explored are interesting, but the stories just start to run together. It probably could have been boiled down into 50-100 pages instead of a couple hundred that it was.
B0055SWM08|1.0|It's really Bad. I played the game and won every time I think it's to easy! I think it isn't worth your time.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I could not put this series down, not between chapters or even between books! I read all three over a 4 day weekend. the 1st book was definitely the best, 2nd was good, 3rd was good, but I didn't like the ending. Enjoy!
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|The game is challenging; but it often crashes. When this happens I've had to delete the game and then download it again.,
1936608898|5.0|I was at a standstill with my weightloss attemps and was looking for something to help me jumpstart things.  I had been sort of doing low carb and pseudo paleo, but hadn't really committed.  My Nephew did a review of this book on his web site and I thought I'd give it a try.  I am really glad that I did!<br />The book is easy to read because it is at a more personal level rather than trying to load you up with a lot of preachy jargon.  I have read reviews that the science isn't there, but that didn't put me off as I had looked into a lot of the science before, plus they give references to persons and sites where the information is presented more scientifically.  I actually liked it that way as it allowed me to focus on what they were really saying.  I also like the fact that they don't tell you exactly what to eat, which is why it is so easy to continue after the 30 days is up.<br />I also like how the life-changing aspect is actually more subtle than you'd think.  Sure, it's a very strict plan that doesn't let you eat a lot of the things that most folks say they \\"cannot live without,\\" but that's just the food addiction talking.  I remember that prior to the halfway point, I'd see something advertised on TV and would say to my wife, \\"we should get that and freeze it so that I can have it when I'm done.\\"  The funny thing is that after I was halfway through, I stopped thinking that way.  Things got easier and I could slowly feel food temptations losing their hold on me.  It is very psychological and about the only way to beat that is to do it for 30 days.  I have introduced some foods back into my diet, and have ditched those that made me feel like crap after I did.  The strange and miraculous thing is that instead of thinking that I couldn't wait to start adding new things back in, I was more like do I really need to add that back in?  I haven't really missed it for 30 days, why do I need it?<br />That is what is called seismic change!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Even thiugh some parts are very thechnical.  I enjoyed very much. It is very interesting to get to know the geniuses behind apple and how they were in the beginning.<br /><br />Wonderfully written.
B00509OFE8|5.0|I avoided watching the last episode until now. That is how much I like the show. I must say it has been a good month or so working my way through the series again... This was the only Stargate series I could get into. After watching one season of the original Stargate I had to quit. SGU was written for adults, adult situations and sacrifices. Really awesome cast, writing, and especially character development. The series didn't veer of into leftwing political madness either. The military \\"doing the right thing\\" nonsense can make a series child like. The crew had to make tough choices. The good guys are the good guys and the bad guys are the bad guys, thanks for that.<br /><br />A nice touch might be Park getting her sight back inside the pod. Just a thought...

0345803485|5.0|I purchased this book on a recommendation from a friend and because everyone I know seems to be talking about it.  It started out a bit slow but by about 2/3 of the way through I couldn't put it down.  I am now into the second book and have the third one waiting!  It really does get you hooked!

B005LAIHZY|5.0|Brave the latest animated feature from Disney and Pixar, adds to the pantheon of Disney princesses in the form of a head strong, strong willed highland lassie named Merida, who has a big problem that is soon compounded by a bigger problem.<br /><br />Merida, who is all red hair and sharp mouth, is a royal princess whose parents want her to marry one of the sons of various highland clan leaders. The problem is that she would rather not. Instead she would rather gallop about on her huge horse shooting arrows at everything in sight.<br /><br />Her father, the King of Scotland, is indulgent while her mother, the Queen, is anxious that her little girl become a proper princess and learn how to submit to her duty. Merida, instead, makes an unwise bargain with a witch and then has a bigger problem on her hands concerning her mother.<br /><br />The animation, which shows an idealized Scottish highlands, is gorgeous enough to be breathtaking. The music, as is proper, is very generous with the bagpipes and often soars along with the landscape; if \\"Touch the Sky\\" does not win an Oscar for best song in a feature length film, there is no justice in the world and no taste in Hollywood.<br /><br />It is the fate of a lot of mothers and daughters to tussle when the later passes puberty. The story of \\"Brave\\" relates how Merida and her mother wage this battle and how they work through their issues while dealing with a potentially dangerous enchantment. There is also lessons about responsibility, getting what one wishes for, and listening once in a while to one's irritating teenagers.<br /><br />The voice talent is exemplary and actual Scottish actors are well represented, including Billy Connolly as King Fergus, Craig Ferguson, Kevin McKidd, and Robbie Coltrane as the lairds whose sons are vying for the hand of Merida, and Kelly McDonald as Merida herself.<br /><br />There are some scary, dark parts in the film, so parents should be cautious about bringing younger or more sensitive children to see it. But aside from that \\"Brave\\" is a true family film which everyone can enjoy.ildren to see it. But aside from that \\"Brave\\" is a true family film which everyone can enjoy.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|OUR COUPLES BOOK CLUB CHOSE THIS BOOK AND THE DISCUSSION WAS VERY GOOD - THE SINGLE THING THAT WAS SURPRISING WAS THE IDEA THAT ONE ALWAYS THINKS IF THEY HAD DONE SOMETHING IN A DIFFERENT WAY, THEIR LIFE WOULD BE MUCH BETTER.  AFTER READING THIS BOOK, MANY REALIZED THAT WAS WASTED EFFORT, THEIR LIFE COULD BE MUCH WORSE!

B007I2BZIE|4.0|There are a lot of long glowing reviews here.....this will be a short dim glow review..........The best Rush albums have at least one song that sticks with you....a song that haunts you.  This concept collection is missing that.  All but two songs pound their message into your head.  The deaf will have no problem \\"hearing\\" this CD.  \\"The Wreckers\\" comes the closest to being that song that sticks. It's a slowed down, more melodic song that offers a sobering refrain.<br />Neil Peart is the most intellectual lyricist in rock music and he doesn't fail us here.  The fact that Geddy and Alex can somehow massage those difficult lyrics into cohesive music is amazing. Rush continues to be music for thinking people even when presented in an assault on your senses as it is here.<br /><br />Rush is that rare group of song writers who have a very deep creative well.  While this CD is far from their best, it is so much better than 95% of the music being generated today, that it only looks weak when compared to Rush's best work.<br /><br />Long Live Rush!

B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I've been a fan of Kelly's since her first CD. She has grown so much as an artist. Until Stronger, my favorite CD was All I've Ever Wanted. I love the many different styles of music her last several CD's have included. Her voice and range are amazing and she brings real emotion to her songs. Since others have broken down the tracks, my super favorites are Dark Side, Stronger, Einstein and Mr. Know it All. I have to say that I do love every single track on this CD. Normally I would burn my favorites to make a mix I can play in my car or at work (no iPod players in my car or at work, so CDs have to be used instead), but I play this whole CD because I enjoy every track. I definitely recommend this CD, one of Kelly's best yet! She also sounds incredible on the several country tracks as well. What a versatile, talented singer she is.
B000UZNSWM|5.0|An excellent review of the first months of the Korean War including the chronographically listed judgement failures of General and Staff Officers responsible for the conduct of the war.  David Halberstam has included a consolidated list of facts heretofore contained in many writings and eye witness accounts that clearly taken as a whole indicate at the very least there was a dereliction of duty in the case of certain officers.  The author has included a great amount of detail most of which is accurate; there is however a few minor errors, however these do not change the major historical points, which he makes.  Those of us who have studied the first months of the war through the many writings have long known that major errors were made and covered up by the military.  This book explains how these errors compound and nearly cause a military disaster of even greater magnitude than the one which occured. It also explains the political implications relating to the firing of General MacArthur.

B005LAIGF0|4.0|This was director Kenneth Lonergan second feature after a long break from the acclaimed \\"You Can Count On Me\\" from 2000.  He was also the writer and has the role of the father of the main character, Lisa (Anna Paquin).  The film was wrapped in 2005 but sat on the shelf when Lonergan and the studio couldn't agree on the final cut.  Lonergan started with a 4 hour version and whittled it down to 3 hours.  After years of legal wrangling, Martin Scorsese and his longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker were brought in to take a crack.  Lonergan had worked with Scorsese on \\"Gangs of New York.\\"  The movie was finally released in late 2011 for a brief money losing run.<br /><br />The Blu ray version I reviewed is 2 hours and 30 minutes, the same as the theatrical version but the package includes the 3 hour extended cut on a separate DVD, not Blu ray.  There are no extras on either disc.  The story is about a 17 year old \\"rich Jewish girl\\" played with an eye-opening performance by Paquin.  Love her or hate her, you won't forget her.  Out one day on the streets of NYC she spots a straw cowboy hat she wants.  The problem is that it sits on the head of a city bus driver (Mark Ruffalo).  Unable to get on the bus she chases him down the street waving for him to stop.  He thinks she's flirting so pays more attention to her than his driving and hits a pedestrian (Allison Janney).<br /><br />In a gut wrenching and elongated scene at the accident, Monica (Janney) dies in Lisa's arms.  When questioned by the police, Lisa makes eye contact with the driver who is being questioned at the same time.  When asked whether the bus had a green or red light, both lie and say green.  Now here is an irrefutable major plot point that would seem to be easily dismissed.  On a busy city street there were no other witnesses?  No traffic cameras?<br /><br />Putting that aside, Lisa's anguish and guilt spill over into her relationship with her mother, an actress in smallish theatrical productions.  She treats a potential boyfriend (John Gallagher Jr.) harshly, instead gives her virginity to a coke-snorting hot shot (Kieran Culkin).  In a social studies class Lisa engages in frequent debates with a Muslim sympathizer devolve into yelling matches that would make political talking heads proud.  In her English literature class one of her classmates goes on and on debating the teacher (Matthew Broderick) about what Shakespeare meant when writing one of his plays.  She flirts with her math teacher (Matt Damon).<br /><br />Lonergan spends a lot of time inside high school classrooms, clearly indicating the film is about the teenagers' transition from childhood to adulthood and the difficulty of the journey.  It is in the English class that Broderick's character reads a poem by 19th century author Gerard Manley Hopkins entitled \\"Spring and Fall: To A Young Child.\\"  The child's name was Margaret.  This is a favorite poem of Lonergan's, given to him by a mentor, Patricia Broderick who is also Matthew's mother.<br /><br />As Lisa's guilt builds she tries to recant her original statement but is brushed off by the police (case is closed).  Frustrated she tracks down Monica's nearest relative, a cousin in Arizona who rarely spoke to her cousin.  Eventually she finds Monica's best friend, Emily played by Jeannie Berlin who hasn't been seen on the big screen since the 1970's (\\"The Heartbreak Kid\\").  She is a real find and gives an award worth performance.  Emily is a perfect friend and foil for the still learning Lisa.  Together they form an alliance to bring a lawsuit to eventually get the bus driver fired.<br /><br />For the first 90 minutes I was totally enthralled with this production, but then Lonergan keeps tossing small grenades into the fire.  Lisa's mother (J. Smith-Cameron in another strong performance) struggles with a relationship with a French businessman (Jean Reno).  Lisa's flirtation with her math teacher goes much too far.  Lonergan obviously has a lot on his mind and wants to get it all in, but he often loses his way.  The film is not very cohesive and at times frustrating and disorienting.  Still...I have to say, I had a hard time sleeping and continue to think about the film.  As much as I want to categorize it as a near miss, the more I think about it the more I yearn for that 4 hour version.<br /><br />The Blu ray transfer is decent.  Admitedly I watched it on a smaller display than I usually use but I thought the film looked a little dark and soft.  It comes in 1080p with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  The audio is just fine with a nice DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  The sound is mostly upfront with occasional street sounds from the surrounds.

1936608898|5.0|This book is so fantastic.  It opens up a light on a dark subject of how terrible our processed foods are including the ones that we consume that we dont think is a problem but are.  I have lost weight, lowered body fat, increased my energy for endurance running, decreased my time for running, limited bad allergies, i can breathe better and I look really sexy.  I feel much more confident than I have before.  Women are finally starting to take notice.  This book is based on the paleo way of eating.  If you want to know not only what to eat and what not to eat, and the why, then this is the book for you.  THeir website is a great help too!
1451627297|5.0|The premise scared me off at first. This book was on my radar a while before I finally decided to read it. A time portal in a diner storage room? What?<br /><br />But I had underestimated King's ability to tell a story. This man is clearly one of the best storytellers of our age. From page one, he wove a fantastical world that wouldn't let me put the book down. By the time I finished the novel, I was in tears. I recommended it to all of my friends and intend on revisiting it in the future.<br /><br />For your own good -- read and enjoy this.

B005LAJ1PE|2.0|the show is alright if u want to watch it once, even though it's not really about anything. it has good acting, script, directing, bla bla bla it's all there but unless ur really really into horror, there's no use in watching it. it has no plot at all and the entire show leads up to well, nothing. the advertising makes it seem better than it really is. if u want to watch it, i'm sure there'll be some sort of marathan before the new series airs. but even if u like it, i doubt u'd want to see it more than once. getting it on dvd let alone blu ray just isn't worth the money.

034580404X|5.0|I really liked these books and it wasn't for the sex.  I got hooked into the books because I liked the two main characters.  They were interesting and I wanted to see where their relationship went.  I mean who wouldn't want a young, good looking, rich entrepreneur of their own and I couldn't wait to see if they fall in love.  The more I would read the more I would question myself to see if I could handle that kind of releationship...to be with a man like Christian.  Christain has so many hangups you just have to read on to see if he overcomes any of them.  I wanted to see if each character changes, if they fall in love and if they stay together.  Most of the vampire books I read have explicit sex scenes so I didn't find that to be the draw in these books although some of the scenes were pretty hot.  I also really enjoyed the emails between the two characters and all the music & musicians the author interjects throughout the three books.  I ended up looking up the musicians and listening to some of the music.  I thought it was a neat way to keep the story interesting on different levels.  Can't wait to read what she puts out next.

0307341577|5.0|This book is a page turner from start to finish.  Flynn's writing in razor sharp and spot on; its incredible.  She conjures up the Kansas landscape and people with a blunt force that is depressing and exhilarating at the same time.  I highly recommend.
0345803485|1.0|While the topic is very titillating and the concept a bit unique, the story falls flat.  The characters are flat.  They lack depth.  The writer is cliche in so many of her descriptions of the characters...her favorite line \\"my inner goddess\\" made me sick to my stomach after I had read it 100 times and that was just in chapter 1.  Overall I don't know what the hype is for this book.  I've red real erotica...and if you are interested in that sort of book the read Erica Jong.  She is by far a more skilled writer.  Sorry E.L. James but your book is a sophomoric version at best...and by that I mean High School!  Let's hope that Hollywood can give the characters better dialogue because the book didn't.
034580404X|4.0|Everybody I know has read/is reading these books.  I am NOT fond of porn, written, viewed or otherwise.  However, I have to say this book is riveting.  I went through the first sex scene and then skimmed through or ignored the rest of them.  I'm sure I missed a lot of important stuff.  However, I found the characters to be three dimensional, not at all what I expected.  I couldn't put the books down.  A little of it is contrived, some of it is overwhelming.  How many horrible things can happen to these people?  I really did enjoy these books and her writing.  She seems to have done her homework.  I put off housework to read these, so......I'm looking for MORE (pun intended)

B007USWCXS|4.0|Back in 1938 Marcel Carne's Port of Shadows w/Jean Gabin, Michel Simon, and Michele Morgan did what could be considered the 1st waterfront film noir. This was a fantastic film about lives on the edge and the extremes that would toss about like roll of dice just for a smile, a warm embrace, enchanting engagement set for later rendezvous, and anything that resembled real love on the eve of a German disregard of all human necessities. This was a great black and white romantic film shot in the port of La Harve. I cannot and will not say more about this timeless classic here and now.<br /><br />Some near 75 years later Aki Kaurismaki uses the port of Le Havre once again front and center to tell a tale of romance tripled into fairy tale of sorts as diverse characters ban together for no reason what-so-ever to rescue a black immigrant boy of near teenage youth just because. Charm, wit, cunning, deft planning, and risk of life are all combined and pushed to edge - sacrifice the all for the good of the one story. This film is a love letter to the heart of anyone whom ever cared because a rally for one is action for compassion for all. Savor a good crime haunt and lines of colored disregard to witness the better half of human nature in modern day action once again in the port of Le Harve.

B004SJ3AXI|4.0|When it has came down to Angry Birds, it has been one of the most enjoyable video games that you can play simply everywhere, and enjoy the madness of the birds. The Angry Birds Seasons is a free and simple starter for the Angry Birds Seasons game. It is a cute and simple game that expands on what made Angry Birds so addictive in the first place. I like the game because it is simple to play and easy to control by the touch of your smartphone, android device or Ipod Touch. I personally loved playing this game after mastering the original Angry Birds game. My favorite levels are the Halloween level and the Winter season. They are definitely fun to play, and still just as fun to play. This is a must download if you are a Angry Birds fan, or haven't even played that classic fire and knockdown game.<br /><br />Graphics: B+<br /><br />Sound: A-<br /><br />Control: B<br /><br />Fun & Enjoyment: A-<br /><br />Overall: B+

B00006V9A0|4.0|This is a good greatest hits album of their whole music line up.  Though I agree for once with some critics Nirvana put out 4 albums not 3.  This collection could have had a few more songs on it like polly was one of favorites, and also from unplugged show what about the song called \\"Where did you sleep last night.\\"  Just some examples I would have enjoy on this greatest hits album.  But I ended up enjoying all 14 songs on it, just wish it was longer tracks wise.  But if you really enjoy the band and the music then pick this cd up and bring back memories of some good rock music.

0140177191|3.0|This book was a BEAST! 876 pages long and not a quick read at all, but I finished... Finally. I didn't hate this book- and I do love a good tale about King Arthur, but this was not at all what I expected. I am still wondering what I missed, because this book has well over 900+ ratings on Amazon whereas the Once and Future King only has 300+ and is considered a staple in Arthurian reads.<br /><br />The good - I loved the perspective from the women. This book follows the women of Camelot and takes place behind spinning wheels in the midst of rearing children and planning feasts. It shows how strong women can be, and how much influence, yet lack of power they had. I really related to Morgaine (the main point of view) and felt her frustration and pain as she tries to balance the old religion with the incoming and overwhelming Christian faith.<br /><br />the Meh (can't even call it bad) - With the exception of Lancelet slaying the dragon, there is very little action in this book. while quests and battles are mentioned, they aren't followed closely and most of the time seem to fade to black. There was also a TON of religious talk that did not paint Christianity in a very good light. It is not the modern-day Christianity, but the corrupt priesthood-taking-advantage-and-guilting-sinners-belittling-women type. Gwenhwyfar is so overly religious, and yet struggling with her own morality that it is hard to relate to her, much less like her.<br /><br />Rather than follow Arthur along his journey to balance grace and justice, you follow Morgaine as she tries to defend the Goddess, who leaves room for all religions and all god's being one, with Christianity which does not leave room for other faiths. Religious talk takes up at least 50% of the book. I am sure that is the draw for people, but I just didn't like this nearly as much as Once and Future King, which lets you feel Arthur's struggle rather than talk about it throughout the whole book. Both books hold the theme that people are complex and it is very hard to be totally black or white in your own actions or in your judgments of others.<br /><br />I am glad I read it, but it was quite long and I have no interest in reading any further works from Marion Zimmer Bradley.are complex and it is very hard to be totally black or white in your own actions or in your judgments of others.<br /><br />I am glad I read it, but it was quite long and I have no interest in reading any further works from Marion Zimmer Bradley.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|These books are so far from reality it is a joke.  It is like our grandmothers watching soap operas, it is for girls who want to dream about the perfect life with that good-bad boy type.  With that said, the books were very easy to read, and were mildly interesting.  After you get past the first two, you feel obligated to read the third book and I found myself skipping over most of the provocative parts just because they were all the same throughtout the book.  I was hoping for better, but if you just want a book that is predictable and daydreamy, then these are the books for you.  If you are a serious reader, then these would not be worth spending your money on.

B0000C8AVE|5.0|\\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\" is an album EVERY folk-rock fan should have and cherish. This is, in fact, one of the watershed albums of the 1960s; it's almost impossible to overstate its influence and enduring power over the decades.<br /><br />Dylan's first album had seemed a bit stiff, frankly; here, he decides -- instead of being the young, earnest interpreter of folk tradition -- to be himself, and the results are astounding. The album opens with a three-song blast that announced Dylan as THE major artist of the time: \\"Blowin' in the Wind,\\" \\"Girl From the North Country\\" and \\"Masters of War.\\" \\"Girl\\" could've been overshadowed by the other two, except for Dylan's impassioned but restrained vocal delivery and his full-blown, untamed harmonica.<br /><br />Even when being whimsical, Dylan sounded like serious business. In the hands of other artists, songs like \\"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\\" and \\"Bob Dylan's Dream\\" could have sounded like throwaways. He delivers them in an almost off-handed way, yes, but they still sound charming, witty and NECESSARY, all these decades later.<br /><br />This isn't my favorite Dylan album; the man has recorded so much colossal discs that each listener is going to have his personal favorites, and mine include \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" and \\"Blood on the Tracks.\\" But this album pointed the way not only for Dylan but for countless folkies, rockers and folky rockers in the early 1960s. I cannot imagine how the American scene could have developed without it.

B007UXSPK2|1.0|Oh my God, but this was terrible. The plot was silly, the stunts were ridiculous, the dialog was for 4th graders. I would drink poison before sitting thru this monstrosity again.
B001F12J48|1.0|I was unaware that this item was old 3D technology and came with 4 sets of red and blue 3D glasses.  I could  not really play the movie on my HD TV because the HD technology doesn't mesh well with the red and blue glasses and colors on the screen.  The movie only cost $9 and did include a DVD (2D Version) of the movie, so it wasn't a total wash.  I'll figure something out to do with it or give it to Goodwill.  Thanks.  David V.

B000YABIQ6|3.0|All the darkest stuff from 1960 nobody talked about.  Yes it's some of the best production values of any tv show in history.  However, based on the 1st 5 episodes, I'm wondering why every character had to be so extremely unlikeable.  Even the most naive women are narcissistic and self absorbed.  The men are far worse.  Tobacco and liquor companies must have financed 90% of this because it seems there's never 30 seconds without someone overindulging onscreen.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I purchased Wool, based on the Amazon reviews, but couldn't really get into it.  A friend who had read it told me that it takes a few chapters to really get going, so I decided to delve back into it, and I feel greatly rewarded.  The imagination behind these books are great.  I look forward to more books in this series.<br /><br />Like the best of sci-fi, this series has a setting in a world very different from our own, but is an exploration of who we are - it's a very human book, with some of the triumphs and tragedies of human behavior on display.

B00138J9X2|5.0|Great album from Bob Dylan.  Good combination of modern rock with some of his old school sensibilities. Certainly it was refreshing not to hear some of the old political stances from his previous work, now sounding old and tired.  Not to mention the music is melodic and accessible. Welcome back Bob Dylan.
B001DF68MA|5.0|After reading reviews for other options (bike trailer, rear mounted, handlebar mounted), I'm glad I found this seat.<br /><br />BIKE:<br />I own a road bike and a folding bike. None of those bikes work for this seat, so I found a cheap, $100 used hybrid bike.<br />This bike is a little high for me (I works if I move the seat all the way to the lowest position), has fenders and a rear rack (All this relevant information for the installation)<br /><br />INSTALLATION:<br />Installing the steel bar was painful:<br /> - The \\"front\\" side has to be attached to the frame, not to the handlebar post. I don't know if this is a problem with this particular bike, but the space available to attach it is extremely narrow, and trying to secure the screws in between the brake cables was very time consuming.<br />- Without reading the instructions (my bad), I thought that the back side also had to be attached to the frame.. After struggling trying to secure it to the frame, I realize that the back has to be attached to the seat post... sigh...<br />- And here's the first catch with the setup with my bike: I had to raise the saddle a little bit, to secure the bar to the seat post..<br />- After a few more minutes securing the steel bar to the back, the last struggle was to join the \\"front\\" and \\"back\\"..<br />- Once the steel bar is secure, securing the seat to the steel bar was easy and it feels very secure<br /><br />RIDING WITH THE CHILD SEAT<br />My son LOVES this seat.. he feels \\"in control\\", putting his hands in the handlebar and have fun using the bike honk to warn people ahead of us<br />At first I feel weird riding with my knees pointing out, but after a while it doesn't bother me at all<br />I really liked the design of the seat straps.. tight enough so he can't stand up (he has tried it several times while riding) but loose enough to let him rest his head in the  front cushion.<br />I feel safe riding with my kid knowing that I can see him and control him and talk to him if he starts to feel uncomfortable.<br /><br />LESSONS LEARNED:<br />- Give yourself enough time to install it, and patience<br />- The bike get extremely heavy after installing the bike seat. I had hooks in the roof of my garage to hang the bike, but now I had to find a different solution, because lifting the bike to hang it from the roof hooks is just not convenient.<br />- But, even with these small inconveniences, I'd do this all over again to see my Son happy everytime we're riding outside!e starts to feel uncomfortable.<br /><br />LESSONS LEARNED:<br />- Give yourself enough time to install it, and patience<br />- The bike get extremely heavy after installing the bike seat.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I hate giving bad reviews, but can't stop myself.  I heard some much fuzz about this series that I inmediately bought the 3 books and read them in less than a week. Why, Why Why??? I completely lost my time. How can the author make a reader believe this world that she created.<br /><br />The main male character is 27 years old and a MEGA BILLIONAIRE, who by the way is never at work and is an experienced Dom.  The main female character is a virgin with extreme self confidence issues and either is blushing or chewing her lips all the time.<br /><br />Even though the book is categorize in the romance erotic genre, I don't see it. What I see is an emotionally disfunctional relationship that verges on violent. Why, because Anastasia is always worried about how Christian is going to react.  He wants to control all aspects of her life and that does not change in any of the 3 books.  Is an emotional roller coaster. Also, I hated that the author implicated that Christian BDSM tendencies are because of an awfull childhood. That is just plain wrong.<br /><br />Finally, the sex scene are completely unbelievable.  After the first 3 times they have sex, you don't want to read them anymore.  The erotic nature in them evaporates as the book goes on.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but I really did not like this series and is not a good representative of this genre.
1475143389|5.0|I am 35 years old and have never done any serious weight training, mainly because I usually give up after a few weeks of not seeing any results. I bought the BLS book because of all the good reviews on Amazon and recommendations from a couple of guys at my gym. It's a short book (I read it in one afternoon), but it is packed with great information. I started the program 2 weeks ago and can already say I am seeing positive changes in my body. I have lost 5 pounds and am beginning to see specific areas of muscle growth, especially in my arms and chest. Mike's eating plan has drastically changed my diet, and I feel much stronger and more energized as a result. The BLS workouts are simple and quick, which is great for me since I don't have hours to spend in the gym everyday. As others have said, Mike is available via email to answer any questions you may have about his program; I have already sent him several questions and he has answered them quickly and thoroughly, including helping me modify the cutting diet to my specific needs. If you are looking for a simple and effective strength training plan based in science and experience, I highly recommend that you give \\"Bigger, Leaner, Stronger\\" a try.

006198969X|3.0|Familiarity with her clothing line at Kohl's, but unfamiliarity with the reality show \\"The Hills\\" prompted the reading of this book. She definitely has an excellent eye for style based on her clothing designs.<br /><br />The book is an easy read with many pictures of Lauren Conrad (I wonder how long the shoot for the book lasted, there are at least 30 different photos of her taken just for the book and she looks great in all of them). The book covered a wide range of topics - everything from closet taming to travel to makeup. The book did not contain revolutionary ideas and did not produce any earth shattering aha moments (you might have to sit down for this news - jeans and a t-shirt actually go together. Should we alert the press?)<br /><br />The most informative section of the book was the clothing maintenance as all the advice was very down to earth, provided great resources, and could really help your clothing budget in the long run. She gave excellent resources and brand names for maintaining the wash of your jeans and great ideas to grunge up your jeans.<br /><br />The beauty section was a little hard to follow as I am a visual person and find it easier to follow along with pictures rather than a bulleted list of directions. Additionally, some of the cosmetic and hair advice did not seem to consider that people of other ethnicities might be reading the book so it contained some rules and advice that may not apply to those demographics.<br /><br />Overall, I think she did an excellent job of directing this writing effort towards her market and delivering the most important information to them. It hits on all the 3 C's...Californian, Cute, and very much Conrad!

B008F5YDRI|5.0|It was a great drama, few laughs, great story. Overall excellent film and I am really glad I watched it! A Little romantic twist. It made me google more about Yemen and The Yemen River and how much of the movie was true.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I admit, I bought this book based on the over 1,500 stellar reviews here on Amazon. After reading the first few pages, I realized I was smiling & felt a little bit giddy. Mr. Howey, your writing is positively splendid! I agree with the previous reviewer who mentioned the poison & elevator issue as being a little hard to believe. However, I soon found myself too wrapped up in the story to let it hold me back! I have already recommended this book to many friends and have convinced my hubby he NEEDS to read this book! I told him it's like the best of LOST meets the best of the Hunger Games, plus more. He's intrigued and I know he won't be disappointed when he reads this book. Neither will you!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|like the game just took awhile to down load. graphics are great. needs more options to get earn stuff for goals
0345803507|5.0|These books are a great read! One you can't put down. My husband actually got a little jealous (of a book):)
B0059XTUB8|3.0|While not outright terrible, this movie was mediocre at best. I give the cast credit for tackling such a complex set of icons, and almost selling it. But, sadly they fell just short. I found myself watching them at one point and realized I felt like I was trying to mentally morph them into who they were supposed to be and was disappointed with myself when I couldn't see past it being Michelle Williams, etc.<br />I wouldn't watch it more than the once, but like I said it wasn't outright terrible. Maybe someone who really really loved Marilyn would find it more a fascinating character study.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I would recommend this book to any of my friends. It is a good read, and I like that it is about a true story. Very inspiring.
B005CKPQ7A|4.0|The first episode was not HD for the first couple of minutes. It's probably my own cluelessness but I could find a video folder or whatever this was stored in, so I had to look it up in Amazon to watch episodes.

B0083SBJXS|5.0|the best movie of the year. the best marvel comics movie ever made. if this movie could be described in one word it would have to be \\"Epic\\".
0385737955|3.0|I thought that the book was a little disturbing for a book geared towards children/teens. There just wasn't a point made in the story about why it was all so gruesome.  I can take disturbing, I just like there to be a reason for it.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|As a page turner alone, without the philosophical themes, the book is good but not great.  I could easily put it down; never did I get close to having the feeling that I wanted to stay up late or skip through other obligations just to finish the book.  With the philosophical themes accounted for, I still have a hard time saying I really liked the book  because they weren't anything particularly insightful.  Certainly presented in an interesting way, but nothing that left me thinking over them for an extended period of time.  Again not a bad book, and maybe I just need to understand it better, but I didn't find that knocked my socks off in any way.
0446547573|3.0|Actually, I did like the book.  Sparks is a good storyteller and the end is a chilling but good surprise.  The book is about rebuilding a life after a relationship involving domestic abuse from which a young woman escapes with strength and courage in another town.  Unfamiliar with this type of lifestyle, it was an enlightening, if not disturbing read at times.  But generally enough positives to make it comfortable and inspiring.
034580404X|5.0|Great book, well written...arrived on time. I am not sure that I would recommend my teenage niece to read it due to the Dom/Sub relationship.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Flynn's development of unlikeable but relatable characters is unnerving.  While the pace trips at times, one reads on for continued twists and the final blow on the last page.  Flynn's work is original and sharp and provides for a spirited book club discussion.
B003AJKPL2|4.0|Good product. It's easy to use and is able to lock for better storage. It gets the job done-not perfect-it did spray some juice and miss a pit here and there- but otherwise it is a big timesaver if you have kids thy love cherries!! I would recommend.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Based on reviews read about this book I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy it.  But I've read it twice now and I can't get enough. Best of the trilogy.
0757302661|5.0|Purchased the book brand new. It also came with the CD. No problems with shipping. As far as the book itself I love the book! It has reassured me of not being fearful about birth and that we ARE women and this is what we were meant to do. I'm 33 weeks pregnant now and I'm very excited about my birth.
B00846TTDG|5.0|As good as it gets for this kind of movie. I have heard people say they thought the acting was bad. But the guys playing US Navy seals were the real, active duty, thing - not a bunch of 'plastic' liberal actors who have never fired a live round or been in a life threatening spot in their lives.<br />I loved it. It's not for everyone. If you hate the military and the USA you won't care much for this film.
B002UJIY7A|5.0|This movie will blow your mind.  It will keep you guessing until the very end.  If you like suspense, you will love this movie!  Definitely on my top 10 must see movies list!
B004UID2LC|5.0|This is a great app because it lets you download from youtube which means you can download any songs you want. unlike other apps, other apps only lets u download english songs. By using this app, you can download as video, download as mp3, and you can see other options too. So, the conclusion is that everyone should download this app.
B006I1OB0U|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the best series produced by the BBC and Julian Fellows once again has hit the mark. I would highly recommend this series to anyone who has an interest in English life from the top down during the early 1900's. Outstanding,can't wait for season 3.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great App. Easy and convenient to use and I have experienced no problems. I like the automatic touch screen for a move.  Enjoy!
B0059XTUB8|3.0|I remember when this film was released.  All the major complaints filtering in where that the film felt too much like a `made for television' movie and not a theatrical picture.  I can't say that that isn't the case, because this film just doesn't really feel like a movie.  That doesn't mean that this film isn't entertaining, because it is (and a large part of that is thanks to Kenneth Branagh), but at the end of the day it also feels a tad empty and it certainly doesn't say a whole lot about any of the figures depicted, Monroe included.  It tries to break into the fragile creature that flirted with the world and hid her pain with a mask of sensuality, but it doesn't quite succeed.  Instead it merely serves as a series of sequences that allow the actors to deliver fun dialog and recreate moments from 1957's `The Prince and the Showgirl'.<br /><br />`My Week With Marilyn' centers on a young man named Colin who desperately wants to break into the movies.  He gets his chance after a chance meeting with Laurence Olivier and a little determination lands him the third directors assistant position on the production of `The Prince and the Showgirl'.  Through non-judgmental eyes he watches Marilyn and Olivier clash over acting styles, and he watches the world fall apart under the spell of greatness; Monroe.<br /><br />Michelle Williams tried to snag an Oscar for her portrayal of Monroe, and she probably came closer than some think.  Mimicry is something the Academy salivates over, and Williams surpasses expectations with her layered portrayal of the complicated movie star.  She doesn't exactly mirror her in the way that Streep mirrored Thatcher (which is probably why Streep won the Oscar, and not Williams) but she infuses the common perception of her with something special.  It's just a shame that the film doesn't give her enough substance.  It pretends to, and from outward appearance it may, but when one digs a little deeper there isn't much here.  As special as Williams is, it really is Branagh who steals the show.  He nails Olivier's frantic obsession with Monroe and his jilted perception of his own talents and future.  He furrows his brow and clenches his teeth and ann-un-ci-ates with pitch perfect command of the character.<br /><br />And so, we are left with a fun little film that gets some right and leaves a lot to be desired.  With the prospects of deeper insight, I'm saddened that this film didn't do more to make Monroe feel real and alive, outside of a spirited performance by the film's lead.  The ending feels tacked on, and the apparent impact that Monroe had on all involved feels lost on the audience because her antics always feel laced with mere fluff.  Maybe the film is just too short to produce any genuineness, and then again, maybe the script is just too concerned with other things., it really is Branagh who steals the show.

6304806418|1.0|Madonna, Antonio Banderas and Alan Parker.<br /><br />A wretched editing job, horrendous songs and a lackluster screenplay.<br /><br />Yeah, those last three things outweigh the first.<br /><br />I really was excited about watching `Evita'.  Not that I'm a giant fan of Madonna's, but my wife swore by the film and it did garner significant awards consideration, so I was intrigued and certainly wanted to check it out for myself.  After the first scene I knew that this was not going to be an easy viewing.  The poorly constructed film barely lets us in to see why Evita was so well loved.  I mean, basically she whored herself into prominence, sang to her people about their unnecessary tears and then died.  There is no depth given to her.  By the films end I knew who she was and how she got there, but I didn't care about it because I was never really told why she did anything.<br /><br />Madonna sings under hear breath a lot and sells her big moment well enough, but not well enough to validate that Golden Globe she tucked away because of this tragic experience.  Banderas is an embarrassment.  The man can sing and yet he sings almost as dreadfully as Brosnan did in that other ill-advised musical `Mama Mia'.  He also serves as like a narrator of sorts who pops up everywhere to tell us about the political upheaval and Evita's health and what-have-you.  There is some beautiful photography, but overall this is a complete mess.  It says absolutely NOTHING about its subject and dupes the audience into buying into the prospect of Madonna in her element but delivers awkward musical numbers that expose all of her vocal flaws.
B007SGM084|5.0|These books were every thing they claimed they would be. You could not put them down!

I would recommend this book/trilogy to everyone!
B00782O7IY|5.0|`The Artist' is one of those rare films that comes out of nowhere and completely takes over.  It embodies what we love so much about film from start to finish and consumes us into believing that, for a brief moment at least, everything is as it should be.  Gimmick or no gimmick, this film made me smile like no film in recent memory ever has.  Of course, any film that burst onto the scene with this much buzz was bound to receive its fair share of backlash, but despite any petty reservations heaped up the most recent Oscar winner, this film deserves to be cherished.<br /><br />Do I think it was the best film of 2011?  No.  But when does THAT film ever win at the Oscars?<br /><br />`The Artist' is a silent film.  I think it's important to make that clear.  For some strange reason, the buzz and hype appeared to blind the eyes of the general public and people went to the movies forgetting that there was no dialog.  Before you rent, buy or watch this movie, remember that it is silent and thus you will be watching people's mouths move and be reading plaque cards and be listening to a glorious musical score.  If you can accept that reality, then you are in store for a marvelously fun ride.<br /><br />The story itself is rather light and predictable.  It is actually like a silent version of `Singing in the Rain'.  It centers on a famous silent film actor who bucks the system when the cinematic world embraces sound.  He doesn't fit that mold, and quite frankly he doesn't want to.  So, instead of maintaining his present appeal, his stardom diminishes and he finds himself going from the top of the world to the gutters.  At the same time a bright young starlet who got her first role thanks to the dashing silent actor begins to rise in the ranks and becomes a major `Talkie' star.  Their lives continue to intersect until, as can be expected, things `find their place' for the two of them.<br /><br />Shot in crisp black and white that recalls the endearing quality of silent films of the 20's, `The Artist' dazzles in all the right places.  It is directed, acted and constructed with so much fun that the audience can't help but lap it up.  Even my wife, who is highly opposed to silent films (and even black and white pictures) was in love with this movie.  It is simple and it is predictable and it doesn't do anything particularly special plot-wise, but it manages to remind us why we're at the movies.  It encompasses all the special, dazzling, wonderful things about the cinema and secures a place in our hearts from the moment it begins.  It may lack substance, if one can fault it that, but it never allows us to accept that fact because our attention is so wrapped up in the spell this film casts on us.<br /><br />Don't begrudge DuJardin and Hazanavicius their Oscar wins; they worked HARD for those.the 20's, `The Artist' dazzles in all the right places.

0345803493|1.0|*******SPOILER ALERT********DON'T READ MY REVIEW IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE PLOT***************<br /><br />Let me state it flat out: THIS \\"BOOK\\" IS THE MOST HORRENDOUS WASTE OF PAPER AND INK [OR 1S AND 0S, IF YOU'RE READING THE KINDLE VERSION] AS HAS EVER BEEN FOISTED ON PUBLIC.<br /><br />Now I want to know where I can go to regain the hours I wasted reading this drivel. If you like erotica that reads like a teenage girl's wet dream, then this crap is for you. It's shallow, silly, poorly written, unimaginative, boring and tedious.<br /><br />It's so bad, that I found myself SKIPPING OVER THE SEX just to get to the end of the book.<br /><br />Now when the sex parts of erotica are the least interesting parts of the book, you've got trouble my friends.<br /><br />A quick summary:<br /><br />Anastasia, who is never described by the author, is supposed to be smart, educated and, according to Christian Grey, \\"beautiful\\", \\"bewitching\\" and \\"captivating\\".  My sense is that she's frumpy and boring. And she has no style whatsoever. She spent the entire first book in her roommate's clothes or Christian's tee shirts.<br /><br />She's in love with Christian Grey--who is a character right out of the imagination of your average Twilight enthusiast: tall, gorgeous, cut, hung, a billionaire, fluent in French, flies helicopters and gliders, is an oenophile, art collector, and all around saver-of-the-world through his development and promotion of gadgets designed for people who have no money. How he's become a billionaire at the age of 27 is left a mystery. And he occasionally talks like a Brit, as when he says someone has been \\"taken to hospital\\".<br /><br />Oh, and he's the son of a crack whore, adopted by fabulously wealthy Seattleites, but he was beaten and neglected as a child so he's a dominant (dom).  Oh wait, he was a submissive, but now he's a dom.  Or is he a sadist? Or does he like it plain vanilla?<br /><br />This guy, who we are told repeatedly is \\"broken\\" to the pointwhere he can only have relationships where he's dominating his partner through spanking, tie ups, gagging, blindfolding, etc., is nonetheless so captivated by mousy Ana that they spend the entire book having conventional sex about three times per day and it's ALWAYS MINDBLOWING SEX THAT LEAVES THEM \\"SHATTERED\\" AFTER ORGASMS THAT CAUSE THEM TO BREAK INTO A MILLION PIECES. And all with the requisite repeated references to moaning, groaning and bucking. And then they immediately do it again. Always two times per session--NO DEVIATION WHATSOEVER.<br /><br />Now you might think that mindblowing sex would be fun to read about, but after you've heard our heroine say for the zillionth time \\"I want this man.  Now!\\" or our hero say for the gazillionth time, \\"Fair point, well made, Miss Steele\\" followed by \\"I'm going to take you now\\", you will find yourself thumbing ahead to the part where they \\"find their release\\" and collapse on top of one another pretty quickly, just to get it over with.<br /><br />Anyway, after mindblowing sex, great wine and the exchange of a bunch of teasing e-mails about what they are going to do to one another after they spend the day not working, they are confronted by Christian's lunatic ex-submissive in Ana's apartment, who Christian bathes after telling a pissed and suspicious Ana to go back to his apartment, but when he gets back there they \\"talk\\" for a minute about the fact that he's actually a sadist (not a dom) and then he pops the question even though during this conversation he's reverted to submissive mode, making Ana a little confused because she thought that was her role and she's not sure she's cut out to be a dom.<br /><br />Our heroine, however, is not immediately sure whether she can marry this broken man, or whether the fact that they have mindblowing sex three times a day is enough for her to overlook the fact that he likes to sadisticly beat women who resemble his crack whore mother (like Ana, unfortunately).<br /><br />So we haveto slog through many more chapters of Ana wrestling with this issue, punctuated by Christian creepily and weirdly pseudo-stalking her, controlling who she interacts with to the point of obsessive jealousy, meeting with his shrink who assures her that she shouldn't be put off by the fact that he's twisted since he clearly has no problem pounding her a couple of times a day the plain ole vanilla way.<br /><br />I'll not keep you in suspense: she says YES!  She agrees to marry a guy she's known for a couple of weeks, and with whom she's had about ten minutes total of non-sex conversation, even though he once sadisticly beat her and has a roomful of torture stuff in their apartment.  HER LOVE HAS CURED HIM!<br /><br />I think it was the butt plug that finally convinced her.
B006WR0A8W|5.0|My tablet isn't very laud so I decided to get this speaker with Bluetooth. I was amazed how well it worked. Expected little from the product, got way more.<br /><br />The good.<br />- Pairing was super easy. Device (Nexus 7) saw it, and once I clicked on the name, it paired up, no code needed. Every time I turn on the speaker, it pairs perfectly, no problems.<br />- The build quality is superb. It doesn't feel cheap at all. Everything seems to be very well made.<br />- The sound is amazing. Dialog in movies is clear and there is plenty of bass for music.<br />- Used it on Skype, perfect celerity from microphone and excellent sound from voice.<br /><br />The Bad.<br />- The cable (if you don't want to use Bluetooth) is a bit short. It barely reaches the headphone port on my 7\\" tablet when it's in the stand-up position for watching a movie. If the headphone port was on the top of a 10\\" tablet, it would not reach for sure.<br />- The Volume and Next Track functions are the same switch. Turning up the sound on a movie results in the speaker also playing the next song from Google Music. You have to press the switch in to `pause' the song (Movie still plays).<br />- Although I really like the product, I think it's very expensive compared to none Bluetooth versions. None Bluetooth $22, Bluetooth $72. That's 3 to 1 with money left over.<br /><br />Other thoughts.<br />It would have been better if the speaker used a Micro USB port instead of Mini USB. Most devices you use it with, like a phone or a tablet, use Micro USB.<br /><br />Even with the few complaints I have with the device, I'm still giving it 5 stars, that's how good it is.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I NEVER write reviews. That is how extraordinary this omnibus is, that I feel the need to immediately let everyone know. It has been so many years since I was this engrossed in a novel. I started this series on Friday and just finished on a Sunday night (needless to say, I got very little done this weekend).<br /><br />Many great speculative fictional works start with an interesting concept, a world view that is in some cases the best part of the book. In this case, the idea of this world is just the beginning. We begin in a self-contained society below ground, in a silo where the last remnants of humanity live out their generations sheltered from a shattered, toxic world. But then the reader is swept away by the story of the characters -- each unique, engaging, strong, their emotional worlds so well crafted that I almost felt like I was living them myself. And beneath it all, a mystery that continues to unfold, with thoughtful and well-developed thematic content. I held my breath through each riveting action scene, marveling at the depth and pace of writing unfolding this tale. I guess I am writing this not only to tell potential readers: \\"This story is WORTH reading,\\" but also to tell the author: THANK YOU. This is a gift I will treasure as I continue to mull it over. I can't wait to read more of your work.
B00846REIS|3.0|Wow...If I hadn't come off of just reading the Fifty Shades books, I may have felt a little different, but this book is almost EXACTLY the same!  It's like the author read Fifty Shades, put it down, and said \\"I can do that\\".  Slight spoilers ahead, so don't keep reading if you don't want to know anything about the book.  The characters were the same...Gideon was exactly like Christian Grey, only not as likeable.  He was gorgeous, powerful, rich, on the verge of being a stalker, has a dark past, ...etc.  Also, an older woman comes into play a little, that has her (Ana...um, I mean EVA) feeling jealous (sound familiar???).  I read it all, and I will say the writing itself was definitely better than Fifty Shades, but just really couldn't get past the overwhelming similarities.  I also felt, that although Fifty Shades explored a lot of \\"different\\" type of sexual encounters, this book just used terminology I didn't like.  If you liked Fifty Shades, and don't mind a book that is very very similar, you will probably like this.  I was hoping for something a little more original.
034580404X|5.0|I Loved these books.All three were real page turners. A definite re-read is in my future. They are great for the road or for snuggling up
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I did not know that there was a lot of hype with this book when I picked it up for a read on a long trip.  I found it to be very pleasant and I really got caught up in the magical aspect of the story.  It was fun to anticipate and decipher the story and it made my travel go by quickly.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|I am always on this app! Great way to stay connected to companies and references.  Havent had any problems with the app. Even connected with my college professors.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Although I do agree that Maroon 5 is no longer the band they were back when Songs About Jane came out, I still loved this album.  I also agree that the profanity isn't needed, but that is why the clean version exists.  Also, if you are doing pop, leave the hip-hop/rap out, not all pop lovers will appreciate it.<br /><br />But, all that said, pop is the hot thing right now, and they've secured themselves a spot at the top with this new album.  I love that each song is bouncy and catchy and leaves you singing it for hours afterwards.  Great job and keep it coming!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Book is excellent - Reading on Kindle - Almost ready to start book 2<br />Can't wait for the movie to come out.
B0064Y5U24|5.0|This was my first Nickelback album purchase.  Let's just say I was impressed.  I've always enjoyed what I've heard from them on the radio.  Now I'm even more into them.  They have a great rock sound and the lyrics get me smiling.  Yes they are quite raunchy, but they are quite fun.  I will definitely keep my eye out for future albums.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|overall I like the game.  simple games that are quick and easy to play.  some games are more challenging then others.  time consuming replaying boring games to get points to open new games later on!
B007RKPO84|5.0|I've been a Kreator fan for the last 20 years but this is by far the best in my opinion. It retains the intensity and anger that was present on the early albums but also exemplifies the maturity the band has attained over the years. I'm a metal guitar player myself and always liked Kreator but thought that their songs lacked guitar solos, not on Phantom Antichrist, very intricate guitar arrangements and some really articulate kick ass solos. If you like Kreator you will not be disappointed with this album and if you've never heard them this would be a great place to start. Just for reference some of my other favorite groups are Arch Enemy, Death, Testament and the work of James Murphy.
B003XU02QG|1.0|One of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life, the action was decent at best, but the acting and story line were terrible!! If you just want to see some blood and below average choreography you'll love this movie, but if you're looking for a good story line, you're wasting your time

B000GCFO0S|3.0|Bought this for my father in law. He loves anything Silent Hill and wanted this on Blu-ray. He was really happy when he received it but a little disappointed when he discovered there are no extras whatsoever! Still a good gift but be forewarned, if you like extras, look for another copy!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|The Dark Knight Rises<br /><br />Great film, action packed drama in the conclusion to Nolan's Batman trilogy.  Like Batman Begins, we get a fully developed view of Wayne, the state of his company and empire, and more importantly his own personal struggle, as he sacrifices his reputation of both his Wayne ego and Batman persona to help Gotham City.  His selflessness knows no bounds.<br /><br />Unfortunately his selflessness grates on his long-time friend and butler, Alfred.  The dynamic between the two was quite emotional and powerful.<br /><br />Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon really takes a beating in this film.  The guy is barely out of the hospital and is running not only the remnants of the police force, but pushing for a \\"hot head\\" cop to head his detective division.  This young guy plays a few twists and harrowing experiences especially towards the end, which foreshadows (for me at least) a possible fourth film?  Sure, Gordon jumping onto trucks and tracing a nuclear bomb may be unreal, but it was a lot of fun!<br /><br />Best characterization goes to Anne Hathaway as the Catwoman.  Unlike other versions of this character, Selina Kyle is a cat burglar with no superhuman powers other than her extreme athleticism, sly wit and martial arts moves as she dances with the devil and flirts with the Bat.<br /><br />Bane was an OK character.  Clearly Nolan paints this guy to be the ultimate in terrorists.  Shooting up the stock exchange, blowing up a few bridges and terrorizing the populace was a bit overwhelming.  The fight scenes with the Bat and Bane were great, but I did not expect the Bat to lose so quickly!<br /><br />Themes:<br /><br />Some of the themes of the film were old, but they were warmly familiar.  The father figure of Gordon, his personality and strength coming from several places: wanting to protect reputations, taking a hot-headed cop under his wing, and finally some flashbacks to Batman Begins where he comforts a boy who just lost both his parents in a mugging.  The Gordon character was over the top by the way.  Let's get past that!<br /><br />Loyalty to a vow, betrayal and trust run throughout the film.  Ms. Tate plays a strong role in this as well as the continuing vow from the League of Shadows (introduced in Batman Begins), all play well and to the hilt!<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Catwoman takes the film to a whole new level; more humor and struggle than the other characters.  Bruce Wayne's \\"Howard Hughes\\" move was hard to take, breaking his vow and helping Gotham one more time.  The betrayals from the Board of Wayne Corp and from friends who are enemies and enemies who are friends, may be hard to follow in the first viewing.  Just enough explosions and firefights to satisfy the fanboy as well as the casual viewer of these Batman films.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />Of course see the other films too:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0571229948 Batman Begins]]<br />[[ASIN:B001OGWY1W The Dark Knight]]<br />[[ASIN:1623160014 The Dark Knight Trilogy: The Complete Screenplays with Storyboards]]in a mugging.

B005IZLPMY|5.0|I went into this movie with very low expectations - primarily because I'd seen everyone raving about \\"Thor,\\" which I found disappointing in so many ways - but I don't think that's the only reason I came out of it completely enchanted.<br /><br />I should say up front that I'm not knowledgeable about the comics, haven't seen most of the other \\"installments\\" in this franchise. ~ Within that context this movie definitely stood on its own for me.<br /><br />The special effects supported the story while not taking center stage; the characterizations of even the minor characters were deft; the direction and editing acted as if they believed that the audience was actually intelligent enough not to need everything spelled out. ~ And the \\"romance\\" was a hundred times more believable and true to the characters than I would have expected. Tommy Lee provided low-key humor, Tucci had marvelous warmth and humanity, Evans managed to convey the feel of a decent, \\"old-fashioned guy\\" without a speck of smirk or chauvinism, and the tie-ins to the rest of the franchise were smoothly integrated.<br /><br />All in all, one of the few films I'm buying on BD.
B004VQFQ2Q|5.0|I certainly fall among the fans who really dig this album. It may be my favorite Sabbath album spanning 1970 thru 1996. As for the deluxe edition I have no input, considering I own this on cassette, but I do feel that this is one of the more creative Sabbath albums and that includes the album cover which I think is great. What I appreciate about this album is it's not an attempt to recreate old Sabbath sounds. It is, in fact, forward movement from a band that had been struggling for years to find stability. I think it's cool - forward movement that is. To cling to the past is destructive and eliminates the possibility of discovering new talents. Perhaps this is why I appreciate all Sabbath albums. Here's to looking forward instead of backward. Peace.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|three books of the same ol same ol same ol.... Reads like it was written by a teenage girl.  So sorry I even started it.
B005LAII08|5.0|After the \\"Cars 2\\" half-fiasco I feared the worse for \\"Brave\\" - but I was VERY pleasantly surprised! This is again Pixar as we love it - a film with a good scenario, excellent dialogues, wit and humour galore, likeable heroes, stunningly good music and breathtaking perfection of animation!<br /><br />After reading the first reviews by so-caled \\"professional\\" reviewers in newspapers, I was a little bit concerned that it would be a kind of feminist, radically rebellious politically correct thing, but my apprehension was completely unfounded.<br /><br />The one thing that can be called \\"feminist\\" about this film is that during the final fight the main villain defeats easily all the men before being bested by - well, not a man and not a male... This \\"feminist\\" thing is however somehow weakened by the fact that no man could ever boast being eight feet tall and weighing around 800 pounds, most of which muscles... To fully understand this point you will have however to watch the film to the end...<br /><br />Far from being a manifesto of rebellion or feminism, \\"Brave\\" is in fact the story of a very traditional loving and caring family, confronted to the universal challenge of perfectly natural adolescent rebellion against the parents and established authorities - but it is also the story which once again shows that true love conquers all and that there is no \\"good guys\\" and \\"villains\\" in this eternal and omnipresent clash of wills. In fact (with the sad exception of deeply pathological families) in this time of life both parents and teenagers are a little bit wrong and a little bit right. \\"Brave\\" shows that the key to the satisfying solution in this particular stage of family life is first to avoid the escalation of the conflict beyond reasonable boundaries... which is something Princess Merida, the main hero in \\"Brave\\" will learn in the hardest possible way... Because the great idea of the scenarists of this film was to make the rebellious teenager the main culprit for all things that go wrong somewhere in the middle of the story...<br /><br />In fact one could call this film very conservative in its message, because it says to the young ones: \\"Do not go too far in your rebellion, because not only you will be very sorry for it, but it is even possible that the damage can not be entirely repaired\\"... The parents on another hand also get a warning: \\"Cut your growing children at least some slack, because if you push them too hard, they will break under pressure - and the damage can be beyond any possibility of repairing\\". And for both sides the message is: \\"Family is archi-precious - therefore, even if you fight, stay always conscious that some holds are barred - and know that small concessions can avoid HUGE disasters\\". And finally there is a very discreet but strong warning against the deadliest sin in Christian teachings, Devil's great all time favorite, the greatest destroyer of men and women - pride!<br /><br />This powerful message is served to us in a very skillful, absolutely not preaching way, by being wrapped in an excellent story (some limited SPOILERS ahead). Let it be known then that \\"Brave\\" occurs in Medieval Scotland. The civilization of the Kingdom in which everything happens seems to be roughly that of 800 AD, as the technology seems to come from last moments of Iron Age and also the Vinkings are mentioned, but some elements are missing (there is not Christian symbols or priests) and there is one strong anachronism (a mention of fights with Romans). But all of this is not really so important for the story and if this kind of things offend you, it is advised to simply consider the Kingdom from \\"Brave\\" to be a Far Far Away Land from Times Long Since Passed...<br /><br />The Kingdom is ruled by the mighty King Fergus, who was gifted with the volume, build and all the beauty of a Panzer division which saw a lot of action, but who is overwise a very endearing fellow, with a heart as large as his chest. He sincerely loves his wife, his children, his kinsmen and his country and he is a fair and merry ruler, who enjoys without limits the good things of life: good food, strong liquor, loud songs, cheerful dances (with a lot of axe throwing), long difficult hunts and last but not least friendly brutal savage bloody fist/teeth/club/stool/table/mug/bottle/mutton leg/tree trunk/etc. fights, possibly with no less than one hundred participants...)))<br /><br />His wife, Queen Elinor, is a very beautiful, very intelligent and very brave woman, a loving mother of four children, a competent manager of the castle and other estates and also a very respected power figure, restless in her work to assist her husband in his royal duties. She seems to love a lot her oversized, loud and ugly as deadly sin husband (it is however hinted that she initially was not at all happy about her parents choice of future husband - for her, marriage came before love) even if he exasperates her frequently, as she is a sophisticated and learned lady, whereas he would not recognize sophistication even if it sat on his nose and started to dance the strathpeys. Last but not least, Queen Elinor has an iron will - once she wants someting, she will get it, come hell, high water or both!<br /><br />The first born of the royal couple is a very beautiful redhead, Merida. Since her earliest childhood she was a tomboy, happiest when riding the horse, shooting the bow, climbing cliffs, eating fish she captured in mountain streams and drinking with her bare hands cold water from forbidden springs. Merida grows to be a fair young maiden, but she is unable to live up to her mother's expectations. She simply was not meant to be a lady - she is much more like her loud, naturaly happy, extravertic, simple pleasures loving father. She however shares one trait with her formidable Mum - she is completely, totally, irrevocably pigheaded!<br /><br />The dramatis personae would not be complete without Merida's three baby brothers, Harris, Hubert and Hamish. They are natural triplets and they seem to be around 5 years old. Now, if the marriage of King Fergus and Queen Elinor seems to be a match made in heaven, those last three offsprings it produced were certainly conceived in part with Hell's help, because they are the most annoyingly mischievous and destructive little imps ever seen on the screen! They almost never speak but let their acts speak for themselves and they are heard really loud and clear by everybody in the castle and around! The dirty tricks they play to almost everybody (including the King - but NEVER the Queen!) can be really nasty... They also strongly believe in the principle \\"No dessert left behind\\" and they are so adept at stealing and pilfering sweeties, that it can be assumed that everybody else in the castle suffers from serious sugar deficiency...<br /><br />As you probably already saw in the trailers, the bears play an important role in this film and there is especially one, a really impressive and scary creature called Mor'du, which is crucially important for the whole plot. But there will be no more said here, to avoid spoilers. One WARNING however about Mor'du - this is a REALLY scary creature, and there are moments in which the skillful use of fog, shade and darkness (and of a chillingly creepy music) gives the viewers a good fright for their money! Therefore I would really AVOID showing this film to the youngest children, especially under the age of seven. This is a serious warning, as Mor'du is a really, REALLY frightening sight!<br /><br />There is (of course) also a witch in this film. I found her a very delightful presence, not scary at all - in fact, the witch is one of the strongest and best comic moments in the film. Do NOT miss the last joke, after the final credits - wait patiently (they are very long), and you will be rewarded with a very nice punch line!<br /><br />It is a good thing that Scots are people with lot of sense of humour, because in this film they areportrayed with a great love - but also with lots of jokes which take no prisoners! This film also DEFINITELY settles the eternal dispute about what it is that Scots really wear under their kilts!<br /><br />The ending is very clever and very touching - and it shows also very nicely how sexy can be a single white streak in the otherwise raven-wing black chevelure...<br /><br />Finally, there are sound aspects. Scottish accent heard in this film is a real delight! Songs are very good and as of the music, it is a TREASURE! Wonderful bagpipes, carrying us to infinity - and beyond!<br /><br />CONCLUSION: Pixar is back, with all its men, horses, artillery and train (and bagpipers!). This is an excellent kidult (kid/adult) film, to see, see again, buy on DVD, view regularly in family and keep for your grandchildren! I LOVED it and I am certain you will enjoy it too!t and Hamish.

B0077ATSSQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Seeing the boys odvious pain, and then the changes in him as he seeks the lock that goes with the Key, the people he meets and getting to know his Grandfather, all leading to his growth and healing.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love that you can blend sounds and the volume on them to customize it to what you like. .
B005CMSDLE|4.0|This movie was almost to dark for my taste, it left her hanging with no one to love and care for her. Everyone she's known or recently met is dead. Facing a world she was only just getting to know. All she knows is violence and that shes different from most people and people are trying to kill her because of it. This is one that could stand a sequil.

1451627289|4.0|Stephen King's books were among the very first \\"adult\\" books I read (I devoured The Stand when I was in 7th grade), but as an adult I'm wishy-washy about him. Some of his books appeal to me, and others (like Lisey's Story) don't appeal to me at all. In fact, this will be only the second fiction book of his that I've reviewed on this blog in the last 7 years. I've always been more a fan of his straightforward horror stories, so I was pleasantly surprised by this, which I would consider part historical fiction and part science fiction.<br /><br />Jake Epping is just a run-of-the-mill English teacher in Lisbon Falls, Maine when the local diner owner, Al, comes to him and tells Jake he wants to show him something. That \\"something\\" turns out to be some sort of hole in time and space, which transports Jake (or Al, or anyone) from present-day Lisbon Falls to the Lisbon Falls of 1958. Unknown to anyone, Al has spent the last 4 years in the past, trying to right one of the biggest wrongs in American history - the assassination of JFK. But cancer is claiming him, and his dying wish is that Jake carries on his work.<br /><br />If there's one thing that Jake learns on his mission, it's that history doesn't want to change, and Murphy's Law is in full effect. Jake has 5 years to live before he can try to stop Lee Harvey Oswald, and those years give us the most interesting parts of the book. Jake not only struggles with the forces of the universe, but also with himself. With the power to change history, how far should he go? Who is worthy of his benefaction? How could anyone not be worthy? And if he doesn't act, can he continue to live with his choices? If he screws up, does he have time to try it again?<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. King has a tendency to be long-winded, but I never felt bogged down in the story. Things move right along, so much so that from time to time, you forget that Jake has a larger mission to complete. And the ending is not what you would expect. Not completely happy, but not completely sad either.<br /><br />There are a lot of easter eggs in the book for devoted King readers. And even a personal easter egg for me. On page 10 (or thereabouts) of the paperback:<br /><br />\\"He also took a picture of us, which he later hung on what he called the Town Wall of Celebrity. Other `celebrities' represented included the late Albert Dunton, founder of Dunton Jewelry; Earl Higgins, a former LHS principal; John Crafts, founder of John Crafts Auto Sales; and, of course, Father Bandy of St. Cyril's.\\"<br /><br />Albert Dunton was my great-uncle! I think it's that level of attention to detail that really illustrates King's love for Maine. I also enjoyed the brief focus on Moxie, that strange little soda that I still hold fondly in my heart. I actually found it in a local store here in Virginia, and every once in a while I have to go get one as a treat. My husband thinks it smells like motor oil.<br /><br />This book made me excited about Stephen King again. I plan to tackle Under the Dome in the not-so-distant future, and I'm also looking forward to Joyland, set to come out next summer. If you've ever been scared of Stephen King, for whatever reason, this is a great novel to start with.Not completely happy, but not completely sad either.<br /><br />There are a lot of easter eggs in the book for devoted King readers.

B006YMLE7G|4.0|While this is not for kids under the age of 16, this is a fun adventure race movie.  Its basically racing in space with aliens and hot babes and weird technology.  In some ways this movie was nostalgic for me because I'm a child of the 80's a lot of the plot and visuals remind me of the anime we got in the 80's, in a good way.  You have girls, you have racing, gratuitous and totaly unnecessary violence and crazy stuns that are done for sheer craziness.  I liked it a lot.  While it is not something I'd watch often, I think most would enjoy it at least once and then bring it out every couple of years to watch it again.

0143119680|1.0|really boring..... The book started out good and then it dragged. Too much unimportant details and no action or mystery.
0312641893|5.0|I have no idea why I borrowed this from the library and waited so long to read it. It completely surpassed my expectations, which for me is saying something since my standards are entirely too high most of the time. I think the reason I was so surprised is because this is a completely unique retelling of Cinderella. Besides the whole cyborg-science fiction element, it gives control back to Cinderella. She doesn't wait for a fairy godmother to turn her pumpkin into a carriage, she does it herself.<br /><br />At every turn I found myself loving Cinder more. She's tough, snarky, respectful, intelligent, an emotional whirlwind. Her relationship with the prince is believable because she's someone that anyone could fall in love with when they meet her. Her beauty isn't what draws him to her, it's her spirit. There's nothing I love more than taking a old-fashioned sexist fairy tale and giving the power back to the princess.<br /><br />I found the science fiction elements extremely well done. Everything has a logical explanation, but it doesn't need to be stated bluntly. The history of the world flows naturally through the story, giving just pieces of understanding until at the end you see the entire picture of what has become of the world (and moon). Though a lot of it was predictable, that didn't keep me from being enthralled.<br /><br />Needless to say, I'm extremely excited that she has so many more books coming out. I hope each of them does this with a new fairy tale because it would be so great.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I can't imagine you or your relationships being the same after reading this book unless you refuse to try! It is entertaining as well as comforting to know you are not the only one that wants to improve their relationships. Can be applied to any relationships: friends, kids, the single life etc.

I used to buy 20 gold every other day but now....

0060936223|5.0|Robert Mapplethorpe was an American photographer who is known for his black and white portraits. Patti Smith is a singer/songwriter. In 1967 when they were both 21, they met on the streets of New York and became lovers and lifelong friends. They lived together and went from street kids to artists. Their paths led them apart but they never stopped caring for each other. In 1989 Robert's dying request was that Patti write their story. This is that story told lovingly by the one who survived. It is a very personal biography and a unique look at New York in the 1960s. Smith's memoir is strong and a compelling look at the early years of two of the late 20th century's greatest artists.

B004LWZWGA|5.0|I have little to say about this film because it is a good film by its special effects and by the various components it contains, from the strong and barbarous terroristic emotions to the powerful and human passions and to the political meaning it conveys.<br /><br />Starting with the last point the dark knight that rises is a direct allusion to the rising of Jesus after his crucifixion and to his rising some time later to heaven. The next film will be the second coming with some self-appointed successor. That will be hard to renew the genre but I am sure they can find some authors to write the next episode.<br /><br />As for the political discourse the film also presents terrorists as people who have suffered some injustice and who come back for a vengeance. They are manipulated by a slice of the top society who thinks they are going to fill up their pockets and their bags. Of course they end up manipulated by the terrorists and dead because the terrorists only have one thing in mind, their vengeance. That's the extreme right alluding to the Tea Party movement and the Tea Party Patriots with Paul Ryan who is coming from that section of society, the presentable façade of this extreme right violence.<br /><br />On the other hand the extreme left and the Occupy Wall Street movement is not very far and the discourse about a revolution to give power back to the people and to get rid of the rich, the powerful, the exploiters and the profiteers and then to redistribute the recuperated riches is common in our countries where it is easier to be unrealistic than to be sober and clean-minded. Ask Hollande how he was elected and look at what he is doing. Brilliant hypocritical demagogy.<br /><br />Both movements bring armies of volunteers whose objective is looting, killing, destroying and torturing. You can have a lot of volunteers in our society. Marx called them the lumpen-proletariat, those who have nothing to lose except their chains, but not their souls because they have none. You have to add to these the anarchists who consider society has to be destroyed to liberate the collective mind and the small delinquents who find in the opportunity the possibility to steal a computer here or a telephone in some pocket or whatever can have some value or can be a trophy. In both cases these movements start with opening the prison to liberate all the prisoners who are obvious social and political prisoners. Havoc comes in both cases anyway.<br /><br />Then you have the strong and barbarous emotions of the injustice suffered by those who are going to become terrorists. They are sent to prison on a whim or for some vengeance. Children can be born in prisons that are nothing but dying hospices. Then some escape. Then some are tortured to the extreme of their possibility to resist and they die during that barbaric treatment, or should I say processing, like raw meat in a butcher's shop. And you end up with a daughter and a protector and a father and a dead mother and a lot of sad horror.<br /><br />On the side of human and powerful passions there are plenty too with Batman of course, an orphanage and the children there, the blind violence and fake justice imposed to anyone who is not favored by the new masters. The suspense of the bomb and the count down. The constant choice of being killed when resisting, or being given the choice by some revolutionary tribunal to die by hanging or to die by drowning when going out into exile. And some amorous passion comes up too, and the valet Alfred betrays his master.<br /><br />A film to see if you like strong action. If you prefer comedies, author's films, manifesto films or hefty social and cultural stuff, abstain from this one that is none of these. But it is entertaining enough to even make you think. What did I say about Paul Ryan? Interesting, Dr Watson, interesting indeed.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUnone.

What bothers me is that when I plug my iPod cable into this cable there is no transfer of power (it doesn't charge). Yet when I plug my phone cable into it my phone charges. Not sure what that's about. If anyone knows why this happens or how to fix this issue, please comment.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I must admit, I've never watched any of the Biggest Loser.  I haven't worked out to the video yet, but after watching it through I am confident I can do it.<br /><br />This review is to those who were nervous about Jillian's \\"tough\\" style like I was.  I must say even though she's very tough, it's not in a scary or intimidating way at all.  It's in a way that gives you a lot of self-worth.  Her style makes you think \\"I can do this\\" instead of \\"this woman makes me feel bad about myself.\\"<br /><br />I'm fairly athletic, but it's definitely not reflected in the way I look...sadly (gotta blame my crap metabolism).  I could see myself being able to get through the Level 1 at a moderate level, but Level 2 looks tough.  Even with a reasonably athletic endurance, I have no doubt that this workout will kick my butt into shape and give me the body that I've wanted :).<br /><br />Hope this helps!!  If people want updates in my inches and such, let me know in my comments and I will give you my feedback.

B003MC5N28|3.0|Review: The Giver by Lois Lowry (The Giver #1) *Spoilers*    The Giver by Lois Lowry    Edition: Kindle, number 1 in a quartet.    Genre: Dystopian YA.    Appearance: The cover gives an average amount of clues before beginning the book, however, upon completion it makes a great deal more sense. It is neither fantastic or dreadful, it is an average compelling book cover that speaks of a haggard looking old man and the torn promise of a forest, escape maybe?    Characters: The book has one protagonist, Jonas, though the readers really do get a feel for the other characters in the book as it goes along. I don't want to include spoilers, but there were certain moments when I became very angry at a character, or relieved to find out one was safe.    Setting: Placed in a Dystopian styled village, the book takes place for 3/4 of the book in a closed in community that exudes `sameness'. It is a far cry from contemporary society, where people willingly allow themselves to not feel and everything from their clothes, to their food or jobs is regulated for the strength of the community. I sense something anthropological here, as the culture and community is priority and the individual and their relationships are not relevant what so ever. Very imaginative, considering this came out in 1993 before the Dystopian Wave rode through literature. Kind of reminiscent to Matched.    The Meat: The Meat: The Giver is a YA novel and this aspect becomes obvious in the book's writing style and plot as it progresses from a young man, Jonas, going from accepting and blind to the climax where he charters a great escape. I think that's a spoiler. Oops    It is stereotypical in its pace, yet that does make it dull. Rather the book is sort of exciting, the type of read that one can complete in a solid afternoon of reading. Only 197 pages in length, it seemed a bit short actually as I would have liked to have more clues as to the world that the protagonist, Jonas, lives in. In fact, that is my biggest pet peeve in the book! There were so few descriptions of their world, it gave the image of a perfect suburbia. Fine- I get it, everyone is a step-ford wife. However, later on Jonas starts to `see beyond' and we later on find out that it is because he was starting to see the color red. Hold up- wait a minute, no where is it described that people couldn't see colour, or know certain words. Maybe this is my own ignorance, I don't dispute that, but I would have liked some clues as to the `different-ness' of their world in the beginning, so that I could have avoided my frantic flip to the front of the novel (thinking I had missed something). Oh well.    It was an OK read, it was in moderation, satisfying, but it wasn't very WOW. I am intrigued enough to continue the second book in the series.    Have you read The Giver? What do you think? All in all I'll award The Giver with 3- Page- Turns.    See ya,    BWB (original boo reviews)  [...]

B008ER9QLK|5.0|This Robert Lepage Ring IS a controversial production. I saw all four operas live at the Met and also in the simulcasts, which make up the DVD/Blu-ray sets. It's true that some aspects of the 'Machine' work better than others. It's also true that many are visually extraordinary---the Rhine Maidens, the descent into Nibelheim, the forest scene in Siegfried with the virtual bird, the immolation scene. The advantage of these discs is that none of the problems are included---the falls, delays or groans of the set as it changed position. The disadvantage is that aspects improved upon after the simulcasts can't be included such as the changes in visual projections and staging.<br /><br />That being said, Opera really is all about the singing, and for its new Ring, the Met assembled a world-class cast of singers who are also good actors, essential for simulcasts. Bryn Terfel is a commanding Wotan in Das Rheingold, a young but troubled god whose  world is beginning to spin out of control through his own machinations. He is well-matched by Stephanie Blythe as Fricka and Eric Owen in a real star-turn as Alberich.<br /><br />Much time passes before Die Walkure takes place, a long but intimate opera. The Valkyries, Fricka and Hunding appear in crucial but brief scenes, but it is left to those singing the roles of Wotan, Brunnhilde, Siegmund and Sieglinde to carry the opera. This is an opera about love, the unraveling marriage of Wotan and Fricka, the incestuous love of Sieglinde and Siegmund and the deep and problematic love of Wotan for his mortal son and immortal daughter. Jonas Kaufmann and Eva-Maria Westbroek not only sing with great passion as the twins, they actually look like young lovers, something not always the case in opera. Bryn Terfel is once again an excellent Wotan, older angrier, sometimes remorseful, but with much more to work with in this opera. The scene where Siegmund dies in his arms is poignant, and the interaction between him and Deborah Voigt's young, willful Brunnhilde is both moving and well-sung, especially Wotan's long 'Farewell' as he places her in the Ring of Fire to await the coming hero.<br /><br />Siegfried, often the least popular of the four operas, is important here for two reasons. It has by far the best utilization of the 'Machine.' It also has Jay Hunter Morris, the 'cover' who was called on during the dress rehearsal to sing the title role. And he's good, successfully portraying the hero as a teenager as he moves from forging his own sword to (hours of singing later) passing through the Ring of Fire and falling in love with Brunnhilde.<br /><br />Morris and Voigt continue their roles in Gotterdammerung, which features other superb singers most notably Waltrude Meier as Waltraute, Iain Paterson as Gunther and Hans-Peter Konig as Hagen who wins the 'baddie' award in this Ring as he also sings the roles of Fafnir and Hunding.<br /><br />There are many Older Ring Cycles out there for sale, but Older does not always mean Better. Yes the dragon here looks like a pool toy and yes, the gold covering Freia doesn't even come close to being enough and looks exactly like my son's old plastic toy armor. But these are very small matters and easily fixed. This production places the operas exactly where they belong, in the mythic time and place that Wagner, according to his notes, wanted. The Lepage Ring proves that the words Opera and Computer-generated can co-exist favorably in the same sentence. As I sat through the four operas I heard audience members' reaction to the 'Machine' go from skepticism to acceptance to enthusiasm. I saw it in myself. But I also heard enormous praise for the singers, the orchestra and James Levine who began as the conductor and Fabio Luisi who completed the task. This new Ring is worth the price and more so. Stick with it. You won't be disappointed.
B004GTLFNW|5.0|I have been exercising to become healthier for the past 9 years. I've done elliptical machines, running, free weights, weight machines, yoga, p90x, dance, etc...virtually everything.  I (a woman) have never had great upper body strength until now. By following Mark's first class (intermediate) program, after only 5 weeks, I have quadrupled the number of pushups I can do in one sitting and over time. My arms, back, chest, and core are more toned than ever.<br /> Yes, there are controversial statements in this book, and yes, you might injure yourself if you don't warm up properly and attempt something beyond your fitness level, but on the whole this book is an excellent challenge, supplement, and resource for those who desire more for their bodies.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Don't believe the hype this book isn't hot it just boring. The writing is just atrocious it gets to the point it actually feels like nails on a chalkboard. Ana is a total bore and loser & Christian I a total jurk who if you met in real life I would run away as far as you can get no matter how good he looks. Don't waste your money!  I couldn't give no stars or I would have. This book doesn't diserve even one
B004NJW96C|4.0|Another great offering from Moby.  As usual it takes a few listens but then the tunes don't seem to leave you.  Moby has the ability to become a soundtrack to your life.  This one doesn't hit as many highs as Wait for Me but still needs to be in your collection.

B008B3H4VQ|5.0|I can't say much more than this is another great album from one of the best bands of this generation. Burn it Down is the first single off this album and its not even the best song! Linkin Park keeps producing excellent albums and knows how to change up their music enough that you don't keep hearing the same thing unlike many of the bands that are out currently. If you definitely want quality music, buy this album.

Great songs covered by the actors and actresses from the movie, who put their own spin on the songs but still stick close to the original. I am not normally a Tom Cruise fan, but the man really rocks it as Stacey Jaxx. Definitely worth purchasing.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I decided to give 30DS a whirl as a way to gently ease back into a very active (running, Insanity, P90x, weightlifting, etc) lifestyle after having surgery. I appreciate the simplistic, yet efficient movements as well as the fact that Jillian is a trainer making a video. She comes across very genuine and not too \\"perfect\\" if that makes sense (minimal makeup, sometimes the assistants struggle with moves, etc). The only strike against these workouts would be that the cool down isn't sufficient for me. I just do my own cool down/stretching after they are done. Overall A+ video and I am seeing results.
B0077ATSSQ|2.0|using 911 as the only premise.  the screenwriter had nothing more to add after the opening description of hanks and the good young actor.<br /><br />would he really knock on all those black surname doors?<br /><br />just such an abuse of credulity in the screenplay.  bad choice by Mr. Hanks.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|How disappointing for modern literature that this book made #1! What an indictment on today's society that a book as badly written as this one, featuring so much gratuitous violence against women with page after page of boring repetition, can make such an obviously untalented writer (and I use the term loosely) this amount of fame and fortune! Ms James must be laughing all the way to the bank!<br /><br />Take my advice and choose another book, unless you enjoy reading banal, plotless drivel penned by someone who must have had her draft proof-read by a 6 year old!

B005LAII3U|5.0|LOVED it!  The acting is good, the action is non-stop, Colin is eye-candy (as Biel and Beckinsale surely are for the guys). This was a GOOD/EXCITING sci-fi action movie.<br /><br />[DON'T watch the original before you go see this remake. It could spoil it.]<br /><br />In the future there only 2 places left to live on Earth: The United Federation of Britain (UFOB), and The Colony (the rest was destroyed by chemical warfare).  Story begins with Colin as a factory worker, married to Beckinsale who is like special military for the UFOB.<br /><br />Colin has a reoccurring disturbing nightmare where he knows he is part of something big (with Biel) and he gets captured and that's where he always wakes up.  He decides to go to \\"Rekall\\" to get a good memory so maybe he can stop having this nightmare, and there they discover he's a spy/agent. Immediately, all heck breaks loose and from there the action is pretty much non-stop.<br /><br />Colin makes it back to his wife and starts to tell her what happened - and discovers she was only pretending to be his wife, (what he thought was his life is a lie) and and now she is trying to kill him.  Beckinsale is awesome as a total unrelenting \\"B\\" on her \\"A-game\\" trying to kill him (even though she was ordered to take him alive).  Colin is trying to figure out who he is and what the heck is going on while attempting to stay alive (with some awesome fighting skill of his own), and he runs into Biel and together they fight/run and try to figure things out...  telling you more would probably ruin it, so I won't.<br /><br />Not an original STORY plot, but it was VERY GOOD ENTERTAINMENT.<br /><br />I saw this with my 22-yr old nephew and he gives it 4 stars. He did comment that he normally checks his watch a few times when he watches movies, but he realized at the end of this that he had not checked it once.  So now this review is really a 2-fer and both are recommending it as entertaining.<br /><br />**NOTE TO PARENTS**<br />There is 1 scene where a hooker tries to solicit Collin by showing her bare breasts (all 3 of them) but that's it for sexual content (unless you count seeing Biel in bikini underpants). The rest is action/violence.  No \\"gore\\" and very little blood in this - basically just scrapes/cuts - no big deal).<br /><br />Hope this review helped you.  Hope you enjoy the movie too!e where a hooker tries to solicit Collin by showing her bare breasts (all 3 of them) but that's it for sexual content (unless you count seeing Biel in bikini underpants). The rest is action/violence.  No \\"gore\\" and very little blood in this - basically just scrapes/cuts - no big deal).<br /><br />Hope this review helped you.  Hope you enjoy the movie too!

0307592731|3.0|Like Eat Pray Love (which I adored) encouraged many many women to haul off to Bali, Rome and India to find themselves, I am afraid that now that Oprah has stated she is going to do the PCT (In an OWN network interview with Strayed), it will become a Soccer Mom Highway. I was really surprised that such a Big Deal is being made of this book, an enlightenment tool it is not, and if you want to read about hiking, you can't find a better book than \\"A Walk in The Woods\\" by Bill Bryson, which is hysterical.<br /><br />I don't mean to be callous about the author's pain, but I kept thinking \\"You were 22 when your Mom died, this is going to ruin your entire life for years and years?\\" I did enjoy the part about the fox and I DID NOT read the section about the horse, nor listen to it during the TV interview.
B000ZBUY78|3.0|I asked for this watch for Mother's Day and I got it!! I was surprised at the size of the watch face, it is a little smaller than I would have liked though I couldn't really tell that from the photo. I did look at the dimensions in the listing but it seems smaller in person. I decided to keep it anyways and have gotten use to the size. My biggest issue is that it loses time like crazy. On average 4-5 minutes over the course of a couple of days. I find myself setting it 5 minutes ahead just to get through the week. I have a military background and being punctual is not an option for me..... Anyways about a week ago I woke up and it was about 3 HOURS behind. I mean I know that these kinetic watches run off of my body movement but i certainly hadn't slipped into a coma so this is rediculous. I guess I will have to go through Seiko and check my warranty about this matter.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|Full disclosure, Rush is my favorite band, and has been for many, many years.  Still, I'm not one of those people that think they can do no wrong.  I think their career is more interesting because they've taken so many risks and failed quite a few times.  This is a spectacular band, capable of so much, that has written some truly dreadful songs and released some pretty mediocre records in the past 25 years.  This is not one of them.  Most of their stuff is spectacular, and their best records are the ones that are consistently immense, song to song, moment to moment within songs.  This is one of those Rush records.<br /><br />Rush has been plagued by inconsistency for a while now.  Power Windows was their last record without filler songs, that wasn't too long.  Power Windows was a great record, but it sounds awfully dated, awash in synths and overproduced to within an inch of its musical shelf life.  Every record since has featured 2 to 5 songs that could have been dropped, in my opinion.  When I saw that Clockwork Angels was another 12 song, 60 minute behemoth, I was expecting something in the vein of Vapor Trails and Snakes and Arrows:  very good but not great, and probably dragged down by an inability to edit and focus on the best tracks with the best riffs and best hooks.  After listening to this album several times, I was shocked to realize that there's not a mediocre song on here.  In many ways this ranks as one of Rush's greatest achievements:  at 60 minutes, it's nearly twice as long as their other flawless releases (Hemispheres, Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures), yet ranks among them.  Each song seems totally a collaboration among the three musicians (and anyone who knows them should be able to pick out the respective Geddy and Alex written songs in the last 3 or 4 albums).  They all rock hard, they all feature virtuoso performances, they all have devastatingly catchy hooks, and they all have at least one line of lyrics that sticks with you.  I think producer Nick Raskulinecz's influence shouldn't be understated - he really encouraged them to get back to their roots and explore longer pieces and the so-called narcissistic musicianship more.  It shows.  There are nasty bass lines, monster guitar riffs, interstellar guitar leads and the heavy hand of Peart's world class drumming.  None of it seems overwrought, and the song is never sacrificed.  It's something Rush does better than any band in history, and they're on perfection overdrive in this regard here.<br /><br />Another thing that makes this record so excellent, and so surprisingly so, is that, for the first time in 20 years, the \\"return to form\\" cliche that critics like to trot out is actually true.  Their records from the last 20 years have been occasionally great, make no mistake.  Counterparts was a welcome return to heavy rock, but it owed a lot more to the grunge, alt rock and 80's punk and hardcore that Alex had obviously been listening to than the classic era of Rush prog.  Vapor Trails owed a lot more to Tool and 90's alt-metal bands like Hum, Quicksand, and Shiner (who I suspect influenced Alex) than Yes and Genesis.  Snakes and Arrows sounded like a band rediscovering its early, early roots from playing on the Feedback tour.  It featured some of Rush's first genuinely bluesy songs since Fly By Night.  But when I heard the lead guitar work on the \\"The Anarchist\\", I finally felt the new-record twitch of Permanent Waves/Moving Pictures era Rush I'd been wanting my whole life (I was not yet born when those LPs were released).  There are songs on this record that seem to draw from the strong songwriting of all their best guitar-oriented records:  2112, A Farewell To Kings, Hemispheres, Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures, Presto, Counterparts, Vapor Trails and Snakes and Arrows.<br /><br />I honestly didn't think Rush had this record in them. I love them, but I thought their days of songwriting perfection were over.  They just hadn't edited out filler in 25 years.  This time, perhaps they didn't edit out filler, but everything they wrote was pure gold.  This album is the exact right length, because every second of it is outstanding.  \\"Headlong Flight\\" is one of their 10 best songs, already, in my opinion.  An absolutely perfect track.  \\"The Wreckers\\" is the kind of song that would have gone beautifully on Presto, but it is augmented with a ballsy, hard rock arrangement and warm, thick production that was lacking on that album. The aforementioned track \\"The Anarchist\\" could actually have gone on Permanent Waves or A Farewell To Kings, and I say that as a person absolutely obsessed with those records, who feels truly reverential toward them.  BU2B has got to rank among the best songwriting achievements of the Counterparts-Clockwork Angels heavy modern rock era of Rush.<br /><br />I think I'd be wrong not to mention that this is Rush's first(!) concept record (crazy to think about for a band that's done such lengthy conceptual pieces and thematic records over the years).  Again, I never thought they'd be touring on their first full-fledged concept record as they near their 60th birthdays.  And I never thought any record they'd make in 2012 would be this outstanding.  The lyrics, as Billy Corgan noted in the Beyond The Lighted Stage documentary when talking about Neil's words in general, are literary but never seem condescending.  The story is being told to you by Neil personally, based on his own experiences through the lens of this alternate future steampunk concept, and he seems like he's in the room with you relating it.  The whole record is a joy, and it's so wonderful to see these three make something so transcendent this late in their career.  This might be their last one, so savor it and enjoy.  To me, it's easily their best since Grace Under Pressure, and might even exceed that record and thus be in the conversation with Signals.  Simply put, it is one of the best releases of their career and certainly one of the bestrecords released in 2012.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Best book ever, could not put it down and enjoyed the next two books as well. Highly recommend to all 30 and 40 something year olds.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|When a blockbuster like 50 Shades comes along, I often give in to the idea that half the planet can't be wrong, and throw caution and good money to the wind.  This time, I can only chalk it up to half the world suffering from mass delusion.  50 Shades may start off titillating, after all its a bit of a shock to read content this sexually graphic under the popular banner of \\"soccer mom porn\\", but in no time the lack of story and endless description of the abuse of one willing virgin becomes repetitive, tiresome, and unimaginative. This Penthouse Forum meets Cinderella story is just that - tiresome.  I found myself skimming pages to try to find some semblance of story, believing it just had to redeem itself eventually, embarrassed to have been sucked in by the hysteria surrounding these books, and genuinely wishing I had saved my money.  Lastly, Its a real shame that so many copies of this detritus are going to be tucked away in so many home libraries, available to 12 year old girls everywhere who stumble across them looking for something to kill time while they babysit or wait for the bus.  What a shame.
B0089LT8Y6|4.0|I'm not sure what's happenign with these bands I loved in high school cooming back and making great records, but I am a happy camper.  Dar ROot sof the Earth is just a good listen from start to finish, Testament has been able to adapt to the times and as continued to put out great records, I think Low was a significant change in their style that brought them to a little more modern sound, but Dark Roots really embraces their classic sound and Chuck's current voice in a way that's hard to describe, you've just gotta listen, if you are a Testament fan you need to get this one, it is an instant classic.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|It was fun but drained my battery too fast. Cute little game. Need eight more words about this, but don't know what else to say.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|fifty shabes is a must read for any ault who has a opened mind about the real world when it comes to relationships. You must read all 3 books in order to get the fool impact of the story.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I found book two to be more interesting with a better story line and less of the graphic sex...sometimes less is more.  A bit of a cliffhanger so you would want to read book 3!

B005JE7WKI|5.0|Somebody else rented this movie and just said watch it. I really thought it was going to be another hour and a half I would never get back. Boy was I wrong. Not going to say much about it except that the writers did a great job of twisting the stereotype. You will not be disappointed in this movie.
0547569653|5.0|Love this book!  It's about so much more than running--it's really about living.  I love that Jurek tells us about his races, nutrition, training (including books that inspired him), and personal life--but for me, what is most compelling is that he discusses the spiritual or metaphysical impact running has had on him--that pushing through low points, whether it's in a race or in life--can yield a glimpse of bliss.
0345803485|4.0|This book was very much like Twilight. I have been told that people could not see the connection between the books but I don't think those people read twilight and are going by the movies, which are totally different from the books. I have read twilight and can point out many similarities. I believe that the fifty shades of gray trilogy are a twilight fanfiction discovered and switch around to look original. With this said I can say that I did enjoy the book very much. I recommend this book to anyone who loved twilight as much as I did (and read the books)!
B008MM9630|4.0|more fun than I thought it would be! highly reccomended! the graphics are fun and easy to understand. addictive, have already spent half of my morning on this!
B006O94DJ0|4.0|Took me a couple of times watching this to understand everything,was good as was the artwork and attention to detail,definitely a collectors dvd but not sure about someone who is new to the Japanese style animated movies.But I liked it.
006197806X|5.0|wow, way better than the 2nd book in a trilogy usually is! at first it was hard to get used to the back and forth of the 'now' and 'then' chapters but once i got into the rhythm it worked. for some reason i was worried after reading delirium that there wasn't a good way to continue the story and i wouldn't like the next installment but i can happily say i was very wrong! not to mention a shocker ending that i hate to admit i was in no way expecting!<br />overall i absolutely love the idea that is behind this story being told and i simply can't wait for #3!!! i'd definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys YA and/or dystopian fiction!
B0001XAPY2|5.0|Yep,great movie,worth adding to any collection for any collector who is into Japanese style artwork and detail.Personally I like the detail in these,so do collect them.

B005LAIH3G|1.0|Ok, I had to write a review after seeing how popular this movie is on Amazon. First off, I have never read the books so no bias there. It is painfully obvious that the HUGE majority of positive reviews are from fanboys of this series. Of course it would be great to them, they have only waited a LONG time for this movie to come out.<br /><br />There is a reason more than just poor marketing this movie was a colossal flop...it stinks. I went ahead and purchased it without a theater view or rent because I had a coupon, it was on sale, and I wanted a new 3D movie. Boy do I wish I had my $15 back. So here goes:<br /><br />3D effects: Poor. Worthless actually. All you have to do is take off your 3D glasses and if the movie looks almost exactly as the regular bluray, then you know it is a dud. Sure, you may get the occasional grass in the background, but there is very little depth. As for out-of-screen effects, forget it. Nothing memorable here. Just save yourself and extra $5-10 if you absolutely must have this movie.<br /><br />Plot: Maybe it would have made much more sense if I read the book, but good book-based movies don't require this. I wasn't lost, but just thought everything was hokey. New alien babies born in a container away from their families. Why? Never found out. They kill all the extra ones so the \\"white apes don't get them.\\" Hmmm, weird there. Especially the wedding scene immediately after a big battle....c'mon!! Even my wife who just sat down to see what this was about thought that was a bit much. And at the end of the movie when the wizard guy (it was obviously memorable I remember the names) transports Carter back to Earth, you don't know what happens to him. No resolution. And if you understand how much money Disney lost, you should know there is absolutely no way there is a sequel unless Uwe Boll directs it (then watch out!).<br /><br />Packaging: Cool slipcover. I can add some DMR points. Needed to find something positive to say here...oh, and it wascool to recognize the shady Senate guy from 300 as the second main bad guy in this film.<br /><br />There you go. Please know I am not giving this a 1-star review because someone at Disney wronged my family, an actor farted in my general direction or anything. It deserves one star because the movie is worthless. No redeeming value, no replay value, and you will wish you had your 2-1/2 hours of your life back. I'm sure this is blasphemy for the fanboys, but this review isn't for them. This is for the average movie-buyer who hasn't read these books who might just want to get a good flick.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|We received the case, did the water test, installed the phone.  While we told our daughter NOT TO TRUST THE CASE she \\"accidentally\\" dropped it in the swimming pool.  When we retrieved the phone seconds later - there were a few drops of water inside the case - sufficient enough to damage the phone!  Now, we need to buy a new iPhone (fortunately we have insurance but still a $169 outlay).<br /><br />THIS CASE IS NOT WATER PROOF DESPITE CLAIMS!!!! LifeProof DOES NOT GUARANTEE ANYTHING!!!  This should be a good indicator right there.<br /><br />This case is great if you want to protect it from accidental splashes, but NO MORE!!!!

1401228801|5.0|This is the fourteenth book in the Fables series and finally takes us back to the storyline started in book twelve.  Finally we learn more about what Mister Dark is up to and what happened to Baba Yaga.  It was very good installment in this series; I enjoyed it a lot.<br /><br />The first part of the book goes through the history of Mister Dark and how he was trapped in the first place.  Then we go to Fabletown where the witches are preparing to smackdown with Mister Dark.  Ozma is trying to throw out Frau Totenkinder and Frau Totenkinder takes a walk between worlds for mysterious purposes.<br /><br />While all of the above is going on Bufkin is still trapped in the Fable's office and ends up facing off against Baba Yaga and a Genie; his only allies are the Magic Mirror and a bunch of seed fairies.<br /><br />It was a very fun issue.  We learn lots of back history and there was lots of excellent action.  The illustration is spectacular, in keeping with previous issues.  I wasn't as keen on the illustration for the last couple issues; this was a short diversion featuring Ambrose and Red Riding Hood.<br /><br />The main storyline progresses some, not a ton and I hope we really get to see the Witches and Mister Dark face off in the next issue.<br /><br />There was action, a great storyline, and some wonderful humor.  All in all much, much better than The Great Fables Crossover.<br /><br />Overall another excellent installment in this series.  I loved learning the history of Mister Dark, watching the Witches prepare for war, and seeing Bufkin face off with Baba Yaga.  Fans of the series should be happy with this installment.  Highly recommended for fans of fantasy and urban fantasy graphic novels.
0062206281|5.0|I so enjoyed Prisoner of Heaven! It is my understanding that it is part of the `Cemetery of Forgotten Books' series. I haven't read these other stories in the series, but I intend to now. Lucky for me, the books intertwine but stand independent of each other. The Prisoner of Heaven takes you on an exquisite journey as you follow Daniel and his friend Fermin. It is written from Daniels perspective, but the meat of the story ends up actually being about Fermin's life years prior as told to Daniel by Fermin himself. I was drawn in by the mysterious man with one hand and was aching to find out how Fermin became the man he is. From a crazy prison cell mate to an abusive governor set out to make life miserable, the story engrosses you on every page. It takes place in Spain in the 1940's through the 1950's. I was constantly surprised and loved every minute of action throughout.<br /><br />Zafon's talent shines in this novel. Lately I have been reading books written by subpar authors and Prisoner of Heaven was like a breath of fresh air. Finally someone who can write a novel! I found myself time and time again impressed with how well it is written. It is riddled with insightful tidbits here and there that I absolutely adored.<br /><br />I actually had a pencil handy to keep track of some the quotes I loved. Here are a few:<br /><br /> \\"One mustn't dream of one's future; one must earn it.\\"<br /><br />\\"Destiny doesn't do home visits, you have to go for it yourself.\\"<br /><br />\\"A mad man is one who considers himself sane and thinks that fools don't belong in his rank.\\"<br /><br /> \\"This moment, this instant stolen from time and from God, was worth all the days of misery that had brought us to this place and many others that were doubtless waiting for us on our return to life.\\"<br /><br />This is an intensely fascinating book and an incredibly written story. It has everything I could want in a story; revenge, love, action, good vs. evil, unexpected surprises around every corner and it showcases what is/should be most important in our lives. I literally smiled at my husband when I finished it and said \\"Wow that was a good book!\\" Go out and pick it up.<br /><br />Thanks go to Heather for this review.
B008D36INE|5.0|When one loves more than another in a tumultuous relationship, there is bound to be problems and this movie eloquently and elegantly explores many of them.  It is beautifully filmed, and the story is sensitively unraveled to the point of at the end of the movie, you are left feeling real concern about the hurt and abandoned Hester and hope that she will find the affection she was so desperately craving when we first learned of her life's plight.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|awesome game. really fun to play. enjoy this game alot. ha ha ha ha filling in the last words until i get twenty.
B007VYDFMS|5.0|This is the ultimate film about the career and life of Bob Marley. I think it is the best music documentary ever made. It covers just about every aspect of his life.If you are a fanatic like me and been waiting for a definitive version about his career and life its finally here. ENJOY
0812550706|3.0|It's simple.  The core of Ender's Game is bullying and revenge for bullying.  The book works<br />for exactly the same reason that Hemingway's short stories work: righteous indignation, the<br />feeling that in a just world things would be more fair. In Ender's case, he prevails; in<br />Hemingway, much more of a realist, the injustice prevails and the sense of outrage persists.<br />The same theme exists in Bernard Cornwell's series on Richard Sharpe.  Sharpe fights the<br />French or the Tippoo Sultan, but his real fight is always against some dog in the manger, some<br />evil coward, some bully, who is jealous of his success and courage and resourcefulness.  It is<br />the same with Ender, but with no realism at all.  But it still works as a story formula.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|I was completely blew away by this film. I am a huge fan of the first Alien and this film finally answered a few questions about where the xenomorph derives from. I will not tell much about this film only that it is definitely one of the best films of the year. It was also nice to see Ridley Scott return to the genre which he does the best. This film is definitely a must see for sci-fi/Alien film fans. I would categorize it as one of the best sci-fi films ever made and definitely the best of the 21st century.
1250006341|4.0|This product arrived in a timely manner. Also purchase was in excellant condition upon<br />arrival. It was interesting to read about the making of this series from the actors them<br />selves. Can't wait to purchase Series 3 of Downton Abby. Wish they would release it<br />much sooner then they are. I will purchase it from Amazon because I have always been<br />satisfied with my purchases from them.
0547569653|5.0|Great book and awesome story!<br />Scott has given the not so athletic vegan a desire to push the limits.<br />I am now training to do my first ultra and love the outcome from my first 20 mile training run in the Texas July heat! No pain, no gain! Highly recommend!
0143119680|2.0|This book had so many good reviews, including one by Amazon, that is seemed like a sure thing but I gave up 100 pages in. How many times does the reader need to be told the protagonist is a descendant of a Very Special Indeed line of Salem witches? How many times do we need to e told she does not want to use her gifts? Numerous times, that's how many. The same material is repeated over and over and over. Where was the editor? What with all the repetition there just wasn't that much time to move the plot along and the two dimensional characters did not help. I would have perhaps liked this better when I was 12 but as adult it was simply irritating.
B0064MT1FI|4.0|The movie is totally engrossing right from the very start to the end. The very actual scene where Ada is parting way with the piano abandoned by itself along the beach shore is an instant favorite. With nothing but the poignant music playing as Ada painfully longs for her most prized personal possession,this is really the scene that kept me glued to the screen. It really is sad to leave something or someone precious to you behind and what's more sad is the fact that there is nothing you can do about it to take it with you. Holly Hunter is very effective in giving life to the mute female character. She has never spoken a single word but her facial expressions convey all the statements words can express. She is truly deserving for the Oscar. Somehow i found myself trying to guess what is going on with the scenes where Ada is making those hand gestures or where those natives are speaking in their native language because the movie does not have subtitle as it was described in the product details..
B008EL4YX6|5.0|Love the game just not level 59... I think someone put 13 instead since 16 is all I can get :P<br /><br />Online mode is well though out and makes the game playable longer.<br /><br />Thanks dev. Great work I hope this game continues to thrive.<br /><br />Please provide a guide for level 59.
B007VUA7VO|1.0|Do not add this Battery HD app to your Kindle Fire.  After loading this app last night, my Kindle Fire did not turn on this morning no matter how I kept pressing the \\"on\\" button and plugging in the charger.  I noticed that my Kindle was still hot in the morning even though it was in the sleep mode.  The Kindle is normally cool after non-use overnight.  Somehow this app that checks battery level seems to use up a lot of energy or has a conflict with the Kindle's OS so that the Kindle stopped functioning probably from overheating.  I almost ended up tossing my Kindle Fire thinking it was dead until I remembered (and a friend reminded me) that Kindle Fire can be reset if you hold down the on/off button for a long time (half a minute or so) in order for the Kindle to turn back on when it malfunctions.  Luckily after the Kindle reset and it cooled off, the Kindle Fire turned back on.  I then made sure that the Kindle was plugged in to recharge (even though my Kindle still had over 30% charge), and noticed that this app showed the Kindle Fire's battery temperature creeped up to 102 F degrees, and the Kindle felt warmer than I've ever noticed while recharging.  The Kindle Fire already can tell you in the settings' device menu the battery level.  Soon, the settings's device menu and this app showed that the Kindle stopped charging at 83 percent when before I was always able to get it to a full charge.  I immediately deleted this app off my Kindle device, and I noticed my Kindle started cooling off and functioning again.  Do NOT use this app for your Kindle Fire.<br /><br />If you want to know if anyone recently had a problem with his or her Kindle Fire after installing this app, just click on the one-star line in the ratings chart above.  You will find that people who are careful with their Kindle Fire have noticed that this app eats up battery life.  Most of the information offered by this app is not of great value for the use of the Kindle Fire.  Why take the chance of losing battery life for an app that does not improve your Kindle Fire's efficiency.  If you want to check how much charge you have on your Kindle Fire, you just have to tap the top-right corner of your Kindle, then tap on \\"More,\\" then tap on \\"Device\\" to see your battery charge percentage.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|Received as expected. Item was new; received as new, no defects and item was on time as needed.<br />It is the second one we have ordered because the children love it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love how it uses the whole screen and its so easy to use. It has a separate line to show what was just caluclated to get the answer and a backspace button.. awesome app!!
B006IDG2T6|4.0|Though the premise is interesting, Mr. Harris did not convince me.  Essentially, Harris argues that there is no such thing as \\"free will\\", because when we make a decision, we are not fully aware of the process by which we arrive at the decision.  In other words, the concept of free will gets it backwards - first comes an unexplainable decision, then afterwards we ascribe it to free will.  The author backs up his thesis with data from experiments which chart brain activity and show that the brain reacts before the person is aware of having made a decision.<br /><br />To my admittedly untrained mind, this is not a conclusive argument.  That parts of the decision-making process take place outside our consciousness to me does not mean that there is no such thing as free will.  It seems a more logical explanation that many decisions happen on a sort of auto-pilot, particularly those that are easy to measure in a laboratory environment, but that free will in most cases also has a role to play.  In fact, I think that the author misses a potentially rich area of study by denying any free will at all.  It would be interesting to investigate which kinds of decisions and which circumstances are associated with what we would describe as reason, and which are left entirely to mysterious subconscious forces.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|It works great on my Kindle Fire. It really helps me relax and fall asleep, too. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to chill.(:
B003EY7JH6|5.0|Asimov books all very good. My order of reading not so! This is the first in the foundation series. Like all his books, you can see the things occurring, without over imagination.
0345803485|1.0|I saw the headline that this book was the bestselling book of all time in the UK so I looked it up on Amazon.  I clicked the \\"Look Inside!\\" feature and read one page of the book.  This \\"book\\" (if you can call it that) is written like a 12-year-old's first attempt at writing, upon which zero editing has been done.  The \\"author\\" herself seems to have never read a page of literature in her life.  People, please take two minutes to look up lists of quality erotica -- read about Anaïs Nin and Henry Miller, for god's sake.  There are thousands of genius writers in the world whose work will never see the light of day and a pile of roadkill like this E.L. Crap is actually being read and talked about?  Is this really the state of our planet???  The fact that people enjoy this garbage makes me ashamed to be a human being.  50 Shades of $&!+
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I read 50 shades of grey as there was much hype about the publication and it also appeared as a best seller and continues to be so.  But alas it was so boring and so poorly written.  No insight to the main character and despite my best efforts it was impossible to visualise both the main players.  Grey being a colourless shade describes both the title and the contents. I wont be rushing out to purchase the follow up books.  Very disappointing.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is the best battery app out there to date. It gives you so many options.  I love it.
0689835604|4.0|This is a cute little book!  All babies love to touch their nose and belly button...!  It's a great way to teach if you aren't using the real parts as examples! : )  The only thing I would say is that the \\"peek-a-boo\\" flaps are pretty thin for a board book.  Just be careful when you are letting baby lift the flaps...Cute!
B0018PH3L0|5.0|I ordered Lonesome Dove the DVD and the book.  Both items arrived in good time and in good shape.  Lonesome Dove is a classic saga about the West.  If you enjoy drama, humor and romance this is the book for you.  So many different stories woven into one epic tale.  This is a book you don't ever want to finish.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B008MM9630|5.0|I have only had this game for less than a day but so far I like it.  you do have to buy some jewels but so far I haven't had to buy any to continue the game but I did have to buy an extra item.  it was my choice to buy it.

B006C1DH92|5.0|I got this app when it was the FAOTD a while back, in December, and have played it and loved it since then so I decided it deserved a review. This app is so fun. It's basically just the classic Fruit Ninja, but with the added fun of Puss In Boots: you can get fun backgrounds and blades by completing achievements, and Puss adds little comments throughout the gameplay. Also, their are fun little fairy tale facts displayed after each time you lose, which are pretty cool! Not only all that, but there are two types of game: Desperato and Bandito, I believe they're called. The one, Desperato I think, is basically Fruit Ninja, and Bandito is a fun four level game wig challenges. Both are very fun. Overall, I think this is a great app and I think it is quite fun. (And I have never had any problems with it freezing or anything, which is pretty impressive! :D)
B006CDCWDM|4.0|Rafa out works almost everyone but the most interesting part of the book was his discussion of his mental approach and how important that is to his success.  He owes much of that to his Uncle Toni, who was incredibly tough on Rafael.  Not every student would be as accepting of all that Toni put Rafael through.  In addition, not many parents would permit a coach to be as hard on an athlete as Toni was on Rafael.  The structure of the book, with Rafa's first Wimbledon win over Roger Federer as the back drop, makes the book flow quite well.
B0050KEVO6|4.0|I found this APP extreamly addictive and so much fun to play, once you start you don't want to stop. It's highly educational for all grade levels too, it will definately challenge you. This APP starts you off with the four basic elements, you then mix, double up on one element, what ever you have on mind. Watch how quickly you can find some normal elements, and also you will be really surprized with the others that you will come up with too. Have fun and don't worry, no beakers or test-tubes will blow up here.

B005VTS4EY|5.0|if you enjoy problemn solving games, you will not be disappointed. the game is pretty challenging but not so much so that you get frustrated and quit. A nice thing to keep you occupied while waiting
