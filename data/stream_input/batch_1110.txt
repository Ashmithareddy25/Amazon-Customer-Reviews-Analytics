This is a collection of instantly forgettable, over produced 2nd rate pop songs that should never have been recorded.
142311339X|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the Percy Jackson series, but when I found out Rick Riordan was writing another series about demigods, I wasn't too excited. I didn't think he would be able to top Percy's story, but he surprised me. I actually ended up liking this story more than his other books. Jason and his friends were likeable characters. They had their own unique personalities, and weren't copycats of the characters in the Percy Jackson series. I enjoyed trying to guess which god or goddess was the parent for each demigod based on the different things we learn about the characters. They all are able to play important roles in the quest, and you can see how their friendship grows throughout their adventures.     I was happy when I found out Percy and his friends will play an important role in the series as well. I had assumed maybe they would be adults in this series, when in fact it actually takes place just a few months after the last olympian ended.    In my opinion, this is Rick's best work yet. If you enjoy reading about mythology, it is definitely a must read. In Percy, we only heard about the greek aspects of mythology, but in this book it also talks about the roman aspects and you are able to see the difference in how the two societies viewed the gods and goddesses. The Lost Hero did a great job setting up an exciting premise for the new series, and I can't wait to read more!

1594488843|5.0|What Pink discovered and tells so brilliantly is really no surprise. The standard way companies treat their employees does not keep personnel motivated! Thinking outside the box and giving employees the freedom to come up with creative solutions and manage their own work really is empowering and makes a person want to work harder. Pink has given example after example of how the \\"old\\" way of doing things (the carrot and the stick) just isn't working. Hopefully companies will begin to rethink their retention strategies by incorporating some of his ideas into new policies.

0439023513|5.0|I finally finished this book last night, and all I can say is... Suzanne Collins just made it to the list of my favorite authors.      I definitely did not see the events happening as they did at the end, which is why I think I felt confused, and almost betrayed.  But I think that shows what a courageous author Suzanne Collins is.  She doesn't coddle the reader and go with the ending that everyone probably wants or predicts.  Instead, she stays true to the characters and to the world they live in.  It's not pretty and not everyone gets a happy ending.  And I was pleasantly surprised with how she resolved the love triangle between Katniss, Peeta, and Gale.  And while I found myself wanting more details about the relationship that Kat finally did choose, I realized after re-reading the very end that it was the perfect way to end the book.  You don't need the author to put down exactly what happened because you feel as if you already know the characters well enough to figure it out (don't worry, she doesn't leave you hanging).      All in all, I think the book is highly enjoyable, but maybe for a slightly older audience than middle schoolers.  I was shocked by some of the violence and heartache in the book.  But again, I find that it takes courage to write about those things and to not just sugar-coat what really happened.      Can't wait to see if they make a movie out of this!

This was an enjoyable read and has also peaked my interest in reading a few non-fiction historical books about WW1.

1402530870|4.0|Seemed like a good time to re-read (probably for the 4th time) after finishing the Worst Hard Time by Timothy Egan. The characters still ring true, and having more of a historical background made this great novel even more powerful

B004MMEKG2|1.0|My single greatest problem with this novel is, in a way, the same reason it is being lauded by many other reviewers.<br /><br />I totally agree that any fantasy book that has the hero stroll from one end to the other, through fire and brimstone and any manner of unimaginable horror without receiving so much as a scratch can be diplomatically described as 'boring'. By that same token however, any book that has the apparent 'honorable' characters snatch defeat from the jaws of victory at every single turn is equally as boring, and adds a healthy level of tedium on top of everything.<br /><br />That is where I found myself in A Clash of Kings. The villainous characters will succeed at just about anything, just as anything that can go wrong with the honorable characters will. The reader can predict the outcome of any event simply by realising whether it would be a good thing for the villainous, or a bad thing for the honorable. It does not matter how ridiculous the potential event may be, Martin will make it happen by any means necessary, even rewriting supposed rock-solid alliances in one sentence if that will achieve the desired result.<br /><br />It will take the heroic a party of twenty to make it from point A to point B, where only four will barely survive in the end. For the villainous, they require only two for the same trip (Only one being able to fight) and will arrive at their destination in perfect health and will have earned themselves an army on the way. At later stages in the book I found myself just wishing Martin would kill off certain characters and be done with it, as opposed to dragging their existence on from one improbable tragedy to the next.<br /><br />I became so frustrated with the book that I would be irritable for about half an hour after putting it down. I ended up reading the last hundred pages of the book at about a page every 10 seconds, as I was simply skimming over everything, knowing instantly whether any proposed event will occur or not, based on whether the outcome helps or hurts.<br /><br />The best I can do at this point is to take some time away from this series (I read A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings back-to-back) and come back later for A Storm of Swords. I'm really hopeful that A Clash of Kings stands as a solitary example of Martin's worst creative works and that the next novel doesn't suffer from the same agonising linearity.helps or hurts.

0375507256|3.0|Cloud Atlas is not a dumb book. It has internalized the tropes of various genres and does a great job of miming each genre, from the paperback thriller to the science fiction novelette and the post apocalyptic fantasy.The novel is constantly engaging and sweeps up the reader with each shift in tone.You can almost feel it when the author shifts gears to a new genre.However, the juggling of genres and their interlinking, while being mildly interesting and competently executed, is only superficially clever. The book does not aim to, nor does it acheve the sublime brilliance of a true literary masterpiece. To em the only path breaking thing about the novel was the genre bending narrative, which many others have done better than the author. Again, the individual stories themselves are nothing remarkable. Like, I said, the idea seems to be to use the standard genre tropes and expect the whole to to lift the mundane sumof parts to the level of brilliance. But, it never quite seems to take off  Ultimately, although the book is not a bad read, it remains just that, when it could have been so much more
1439153663|5.0|This is one of those books that have you reading later than you should and sneaking chapter the next morning at work.<br /><br />Lavinia, a young seven year old is orphaned while onboard a ship from Ireland to America. Since there is no one left to care for her, the ship's captain James Pyke, takes her home to work as an indentured servant.  1791 Tidewater, Virginia is not an easy time in America's history, so when you bring a white girl in to work in the kitchen house of a tobacco plantation there are bound to be problems.  Lavinia tries her best to bond with Belle, the illegitimate daughter of the plantation owner, and to fit into the social order that has been laid out at the plantation.  However, her white skin sets her apart and when at the age of 17 she marries Marshall Pyke, the Captain's son, literally all hell breaks loose when racial tensions, family misunderstanding, lynching, rape, arson, and murder rear their inevitable ugly head at Tall Oaks Plantation.<br /><br />Told in a narrative back and forth style between Lavinia and Belle, the reader sees the full picture that neither character is fully aware of until the inevitable and horrible conclusion is reached.  The reader finds themselves cheering on beloved characters and at the same time scratching their heads as to how a person living this nightmare can be so blind to what is truly going on right under their noses.<br /><br />Not your usual antebellum novel in that Kathleen Grissom shows equal sides in the same story.  There are no clear-cut winners and losers here; each person has their story to tell and their way of making the best of a horrible situation.<br /><br />I highly recommend this fast paced, evenly drawn fictional book to anyone that might want to see yet a different view of this period in our history.
0451529308|4.0|This book is timeless- beautifully written, interesting, and with themes that transcend generations. I finished reading it a few weeks ago and already feel the urge to read it again. Alcott's novel presents subtle yet astute viewpoints regarding the tension between the traditional domestic roles of females and the push for women's rights which was beginning in the mid-1800s. Pay close atttention to the character of Beth to see Alcott's view on how overly-domestic women fair in the modern/changing world. I will say, though, that the ending seemed very forced, almost contrived.    Also, Amazon suggests that 9-12 is a good age to read this book...maybe that was true 50 years ago, when society read more and was more literate in general, but for today, I would personally suggest 12-14 as the perfect age to read this book (for average readers).
B00004RD54|5.0|How could Amazon place such a wrong-headed review on this record?  Like the record or not, a passionless snoozefest it's not!  Far from phoned-in, contemptuous vocals, \\"Heroin\\" and \\"Sweet Jane\\" are classic versions.  I like the original VU recordings better myself, but wouldn't be without this record.  Some clever classic album company should put out an album of the original concert in full, in original playing order (That is, both the \\"Rock & Roll Animal\\" remaster and \\"Lou Reed Live\\").  What a concert that must have been, and what a record it would make.  It sure wouldn't be hard to like.

It has a picture of each item in the book, and has helpful baking information at the back of the book.  I would recommend this for anyone who would like a simple cookie to whip up with ingredients already in your home, or for something a little more special.  I never buy a cookbook that doesn't have plenty of pictures, and this one is perfect.  I found it at the store one day and I've never doubted it was worth every penny.
0525423273|3.0|if you're going to emphasize hair THIS MUCH, at least put it in the title. Don't try to hide it! It's okay, we get it. Everyone has their fetish. But good golly--not only would I recommend therapy for Anna's odd obsession with St. Clair's hair, but I really did not need the extraneous description of EVERY SINGLE character's hair. From beards to streaks to frizz to ponytails to flips to shine, texture, wet/damp/dry, length, color: this book has it all! ...if you want to read a salon ad.     I mention this only because tics like this REALLY bother me and pull me out of the story. As for the rest of the book, it was decent, if you can slog through the first 100 pages of explanation and backstory dumping. The humor screamed Meg Cabot rip-off, and I'm a little tired of that rambling, quirky 'YA' humor. It's just a little easy. I'm sounding like a jerk and I really don't want to... the book had it's strong points as well. Eventually the characters behind the hair came out to play; I really appreciated that Anna and Etienne fell in love because they became genuine friends, not just because they were so \\"hot\\". The pacing was good, it is compulsively readable, and the entire Thanksgiving break bit was pure YA ecstasy. Now THAT brought me back to my adolescence with skin tingling precision!     I will definitely read Stephanie Perkins' next book--this is a debut novel, but she shows a lot of promise. Here's hoping she weaves in character and backstory with more scenes next time. Could have read the book in half the time if I wasn't taking so long to cut through all the exposition...
B000VBJEFK|5.0|Every movie that Pixar makes is great.  They have come to define excellence in current cinema, and movies like \\"Ratatouille\\" demonstrate why.  I watched it last night for the first time on Blu-ray.  The colors, music, story, characters, humor, and pacing are simply perfect.  There is magic in this film, as there is in all Pixar movies, and if you haven't already seen it I highly recommend that you do, especially on Blu-ray.  This may be the best film of the decade.

Even if you do not plan on doing any of your own work the knowledge imparted via the in depth information and detailed pictures with everyday layman explanations will pay off with a better understanding of the Porsche Boxster and how it works.  If you do plan on tinkering with your Boxster, this book is WITHOUT A DOUBT, a MUST HAVE.  Great job Wayne!!!!!
B002VHI8FE|5.0|If you are searching for a \\"great\\" story, one you can't put down, search no further because Joe Abercrombie has writen an awesome epic trilogy! Joe's addictive writing style has everything you could ask for in a fictional fantasy except with a whole new spin on it. There isn't just one main character but several, all described with their own ups and downs but equally realatable in their own way. Although this is by no means a comedy, there are some hilarious moments I couldn't help but laugh at. For me, this is the best story I've read all year!<br /><br />Joe Abercrombie, Your imagination is amazing! Thanks for the tale, never stop sharing them...
0061726826|5.0|I got to read Delirium as an advance reader copy and then again when the book came out.  Both times I felt the same emotions - happiness, sorrow, loneliness and suspense.  Imagine love as a disease - no touching, kissing, or real bond between parent and child.  What would you do if you found yourself falling for someone you told yourself you wouldn't?  This is the dilemma that Lena faces in her day to day life.  I'm so glad this book is part of a trilogy because I want to see more of Lena and her world.  Not to mention the cliffhanger we are left with at the end!  I have read Lauren Oliver's first book and enjoyed it but I liked this story so much more.  The characters felt more real to me and I could relate to Lena.  It's dystopian fiction at its best and rivels the Hunger Games as my favorite dystopian series.  If you haven't discovered Lauren Oliver, you are in for a real treat! I recommend this for fans of dystopian fiction and a fast-paced story!

0393307050|4.0|i have read  some of the negative reviews, and i will try to address the concerns that you might have after reading them about buying this book.       the most common problem that people have with these books is that they simply don't understand o'brian's writing. i did as well. however, it wasn't all that bad. with a mediocre understanding of sailing in general, i was able to understand a surprisingly un-general amount of the part of the novel that takes place  at sea. for the rest of the book i had next to no trouble at all understanding. a related complaint is that some people felt that the writing style of the author is stuffy and impersonal. i think that that is just their way of saying that they don't understand what was going on, and felt far too indignant that this book was not written for children to admit it. i will admit that the writing of these books are not for everyone, but then again, it's always like that. if you feel cautious about buying the first book, you should rent it from a library, and be reassured that the author gets better every book, and that you'll get used to it, posibly to the point of asking someone to pass the lemonade \\"if you please\\"      many people also complained that the plot itself was terrible. they accused of just being a set-up to the second book. i really don't understand that one. isn't that how it usually works in a series of books, one leading to the next? they also decided that the plot seems to lag a bit. certainly the manner of o'brian's writing is encompassing, and his characters have a lot to say, but the plot does not lag at all. O'brian's writing is so entertaining and just plain funny that you'll find you don't mind ten page conversations anymore, you'll positively pray for them. of course you probably won't believe that until you try it, but it is true nonetheless. i think this complaint also stems from people not understanding the author's writing.       some people felt that the inter-character relationshipswere very unbelievable. i have no idea where that one came from. to tell you the truth i was very surprised the first time i read this book that the author, who i then thought to be just another naval writer, was very good at that type of thing.      some also thought that the battles were portrayed unrealisticaly, or that there were perhaps minor historical innacuracies to be found which absolutely ruined the entire book for them (i found none) or that none of the characters are easily related to. the battles, i felt were more than enough, especialy with stephen's medical diagnosis of injuries in archaic 18 century-ish which always makes every thing sound more horrifying. as to the historical innaccuracies, the author warns you in his preface that this is a novel, not a history book, and although he has tried to keep within the boundaries of historical records, he has found it neccesary to stray from them in small ways for short times. the only viable complaint i have found is the third and final one, that the characters can be hard to relate to at times. certainly it would help if you are a doctor or an intelligence agent (read the book) or a captain in the royal navy, or play the cello, but i find that even though some of their actions seem to make less sense to me as it does to them, i am fine with it, because the characters feel real, tehy are developed beautifuly, and because this is otherwise such a good book. every one should read it, and the whole aubrey/maturin series.

0545128285|4.0|I'm not sure what some of the negative reviewers were expecting. We got a taste of \\"The Tales of Beedle The Bard\\" in \\"Deathly Hallows\\". For me, there was no confusion about what this book was going to be, as we got to read one of the stories(The Tale of the Three Brothers) in \\"Deathly Hallows\\". The story is also situated in the book perfectly- there can be no doubt about the fact that it is a FAIRY TALE and that is all.    Anyone who was expecting an 8th installment to the Harry Potter series obviously wasn't paying attention.    That said, this is a delightful little book of fairy tales that gives us some more insight into the world of Harry, Hermione, Ron and friends.    The fact that Rowling is able to create perfectly crafted fairy tales to me is just baffling. Even as an English teacher who has spent many college and professional years writing both for work and fun, I can't IMAGINE being able to do this. Try it. It's harder than you would think to come up with a Grimm's-esque tale. It has to have the right mixture of magic and morality, and Rowling gets it just right.    The foot-notes by Hermione and Dumbledore are cute and amusing, and give devoted fans another small dose of the Harry Potter world they've been missing.    Is it an instant classic? In my home, yes. Around the world, no, probably not, but she wrote it as a fun gift for a few friends, and it ended up being published. They're selling the thing for 10 bucks a pop, and donating the proceeds to charity...it isn't going to be bloody Shakespeare.

0783225482|4.0|I remember when the film came out.  So much press about the special effects in the film.    And, what does Universal do?  Makes the film ONLY in full screen?  Does NOT do justice to the film.    The film itself is entertaining.  Meryl & Goldie do good jobs with their characters.  Willis, did NOT need him in here.  I think he was miscast.    Going back to the special effects, they were good & do well in standing up to the test of time.    No good extras on this, just standard cast information.  NOTHING on the actors or the special effects, nothing.    I hope Universal rereleases the film IN THE NEEDED WIDE SCREEN FORMAT.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I'm a very new Adele fan.  I caught her performance on Ellen before Christmas 2010 and became an instant fan!  I've counted the months and days until this album was released.  I am sooooooooooo in awe of her voice and the compassion it exudes on this album.  It was sooo worth the wait.    I'm a grandmother of six, a lover of all types music from Led Zeppelin to Rascal Flatts; from Floyd Cramer to The Black Keyes.  It takes something that reaches out and grabs me by the heart...stirs my deepest emotion, and yes, makes me cry...to get added to this old lady's playlist.      10 out of 11 songs on this album do just that.  I'm not going to bother to identify the one that moves me the least simply because I still love it.  It just didn't ZAP me.  But, holy hell, 10 out of 11?  That's amazing!    Favorites at this writing are:  Rolling in The Deep (of course), Rumour Has It, and Set Fire to The Rain.    Adele, the sky's the limit, lady!  Keep cranking them!
B002QGUFWE|1.0|I too was VERY disappointed when I purchased this 2-CD set the minute it came out only to find that the songs are censored! Before I bought the album I didn't even have a choice on Amazon of getting an explicit or clean version, so I assumed that the songs were not tampered with. I searched around and saw that iTunes has GaGa's \\"Fame Monster\\" songs in their explicit versions, but I absolutely REFUSE to pay for the songs AGAIN since I've already purchased the album once already, where the unedited ones should have been on there in the first place! And record companies wonder why everyone downloads songs for free instead of paying for them? It's because of reasons like this and the high prices.<br /><br />On a more positive note, I LOVE Lady Gaga and these CDs - these songs are awesome and I never get tired of listening to them. (I just wish they weren't edited where she now says \\"I'm a free bit**\\" in \\"Dance In The Dark\\". The other songs that are edited are \\"Bad Romance\\" and \\"Monster\\" - you know, all the GOOD songs!)
014241543X|4.0|One millisecond, that's all it takes, and Mia loses everything dear to her heart. Her life is over. Or is it, really? After a terrible car accident, Mia finds herself outside her body, witnessing her family's and friends' distress, the effort of the medical team to save her life, her boyfriend's struggle to get the right to visit her in the ICU, and her own body fighting death... Soon Mia realises that her fate lies in her own hands. She faces a dilemma bigger than everything she's ever experienced, should she decide to stay - and face her losses - or move on to another dimension...<br /><br />The issues of out-of-body experience, afterlife, and death that Mia faces interest me. In my latest novel Body Swap ([[ASIN:1453876928 Body Swap: The world's first text message adventure romance with the other side!]]), the hero faces something similar. I was therefore looking forward to finding out how Gayle Forman dealt with those issues in If I Stay. The story is gripping. Mia's dilemma, her struggle, her hopes and fears become ours. It is impossible to read this novel without asking oneself the question of what we would do, would we find ourselves in Mia's situation. Forman's writing is full of vivid images, at times light and airy, at times strong and heavy, such as the minutes following Mia's accident. But they are always spot-on. I found the questions going through Mia's mind sometimes a little too obvious or brushed over too quickly, but overall, Forman did a very good job. I did get slightly annoyed at first though when the narrative went from the present to the past, and again, and again. I felt that the flashbacks slowed the action and were a little repetitive. But once you got to know the characters, it was fine. Some parts of the book seem to lack emotion at first, for example the cold way Mia watches the world from outside her body, but in fact it's a way for Forman to show the distance between the new Mia and her former life - that is until she finds herself dragged back into it - big time.k into it - big time.
B0041X901C|4.0|In 2006, Capitol Records USA released a '30th Anniversary' edition of Steve Miller's 9th studio album \\"Fly Like An Eagle\\" as a 2-disc set (CD + DVD).<br />Edsel EDSX 3010 is a 'UK' mid-priced reissue of that American version (released October 2010) and breaks down as follows:<br /><br />Tracks 1 to 12 are the LP \\"Fly Like An Eagle\\" released May 1976 in the USA on Capitol Records ST-11497 and in the UK on Mercury 9286 177 (it peaked at number 3 on the US charts and at number 11 in the UK).<br />Tracks 13, 14 and 15 are Previously Unreleased 'Bonus' Tracks - \\"Fly Like An Eagle '73 [Demo]\\", \\"Take The Joker And Run [Acoustic Demo Version]\\" and \\"Rockin' Me '76 Slow [Demo]\\"<br /><br />Seven of the album's twelve-tracks were issued across 4 x 7\\" singles in both the USA and the UK - this CD (51:18 minutes) will allow you to sequence them all as follows:<br /><br />1. \\"Take The Money And Run\\" b/w \\"Sweet Maree\\"<br />May 1976 USA 7\\" on Capitol 4260 - May 1976 UK 7\\" on Mercury 6078 800<br /><br />2. \\"Rock 'n Me\\" b/w \\"Shu Ba Da Du Ma Ma Ma Ma\\" and \\"Living In The U.S.A.\\"<br />August 1976 USA 7\\" on Capitol 4323 - October 1976 UK 7\\" on Mercury 6078 804<br />[Note: the 1st US B-side was \\"Shu Ba Da Du...\\", a track from 1973 album \\"The Joker\\"; it was then reissued with \\"Living In The U.S.A.\\" as it's B-side, a track from the 1969 LP \\"Sailor\\".<br />The British B-side is \\"The Window\\" - a track off the \\"Fly Like An Eagle\\" album]<br /><br />3. \\"Fly Like An Eagle\\" b/w \\"Mercury Blues\\"<br />December 1976 USA 7\\" on Capitol 4372 - August 1976 UK 7\\" on Mercury 6078 802<br />[Note: the US B-side is a track off the \\"Fly Like An Eagle\\" album, but the British B-side is an old track called \\"Lovin' Cup\\" from 1973's \\"The Joker\\"]<br /><br />4. \\"Serenade\\" b/w \\"Dance, Dance, Dance\\"<br />January 1977 UK 7\\" single on Mercury 6078 808 [No US 7\\" equivalent]<br /><br />The original US and UK vinyl album cover was a very plain affair (no insert or inner sleeve) and had barely readable credits on the rear - so it's nice to finally see the artwork given a long overdue upgrade. This new UK reissue comes in a very fetching 3-way foldout card digipak featuring expanded artwork on both the front and rear - all of it in the same colour scheme as the original vinyl album. Inside the tri-gatefold - the three-piece band is pictured - Steve Miller on Vocals, Guitar, Sitar and Roland Keyboards, Lonnie Turner on Bass with Gary Mallaber on Drums And Percussion. The audio CD, DVD and areas beneath the see-through plastic trays all feature live photos of Miller from the 2005 concert while the new 20-page booklet has comprehensive liner notes by JOEL SELVIN of the San Francisco Chronicle. They've reproduced the Capitol Records 3-page Promo Blurb of May 1976 with the Lyrics provided for the first time too. The packaging is very tasty indeed. But the real fireworks lie in the sound...and the huge amount of goodies on the DVD.<br /><br />Like \\"Book Of Dreams\\", I've had the 1998 Eagle reissue for years just to have the album on CD - but this new 2011 sonic upgrade is truly superlative. Remastered by BARRY GRINT at Alchemy in London, the sound quality is massively improved on every track - and not just trebled up to the nines for effect. This is not a 'loud' CD for 'loudness' sake - it has power and muscle and great 'presence'.<br /><br />Right from the swirling synths of the album's instrumental opener \\"Space Intro\\" through to the opening guitar and bass of \\"Flying Like An Eagle\\" (lyrics above) - the remaster is light, clear and beautifully produced. There isn't hiss - nor is there a feeling of over-compression - the instruments have air around them and sound 'live'. Chris McCarty's \\"Wild Mountain Honey\\" sounds so sweet now and the drums of \\"Serenade\\" whack out of your speakers with an impressive tightness. The slinky \\"Mercury Blues\\" (written by Karl Douglass and Robert Geddins) has great guitar-work - so clear and full while the James Cotton harmonica on \\"Sweet Maree\\" is fantastic - warblingmean and moody in your living room. I've never really like \\"Dance, Dance, Dance\\" or the oddly-out-of-place cover of Sam Cooke's \\"You Send Me\\", but Steve Miller/Jason Cooper original \\"The Window\\" is a great way to finish the record - and it sounds fab too.<br /><br />Then comes something genuinely shocking - the 1973 demo of \\"Fly Like An Eagle\\" which is superbly produced and an entirely different take on the finished version we're so used to. It's just brilliant - taking the song in a more funky-rock direction. It has far more emphasis on the socially conscious lyrics - and it fades out with a long echoed-guitar finish that had me grinning from ear-to-ear. The \\"Acoustic\\" Demo of \\"Take The Money And Run\\" has an almost Doobie Brothers circa Tom Johnston feel - it's excellent. As is the acoustically slowed down folky demo of \\"Rockin' Me\\" - with it's spoken lyrics and in-studio giggling towards the end - it's clearly a work in progress and yet it still feels fully formed.<br /><br />The DVD features 3 items - a 2-hour 22-track live concert filmed 17 September 2005 at The Shoreline Amphitheater, Mountain View in California, a 2006 documentary called \\"Thirty Years Rock'n\\" conducted by Joel Selvin about the making of the album which includes an interview with Steve Miller - and finally a 5.1 Surround Sound Mix of the \\"Fly Like An Eagle\\" album. It has to be said that the definition of the picture wavers from clear to blurry on almost all the numbers (I don't know why given it's a modern-day shoot), but the band are super-tight and incredibly well rehearsed - so the songs are superbly delivered (enjoying themselves too) and the sound is great. Some have experienced problems with synching, but I found it ok. \\"I Love The Life I Live, I Live The Life I Love\\", \\"Got Love If You Want It\\" and \\"Gangster Of Love\\" are considerably enhanced by the Blues Boogie presence of George Thorogood on Guitar and Vocals (great stuff), while \\"All Your Love (I Miss Loving)\\" introduces the incredible versatility of Joe Satriani on Lead Guitar (he and Miller play off each other so well on a few Blues standards). It's a shame the picture quality isn't better, but the music is superb.<br /><br />So there you have it - a great Seventies Radio-friendly Rock album given a properly cool makeover (with genuine bonus tracks), massively improved packaging, top sound quality, a bonus DVD jam-packed with good stuff (albeit a little creaky in places so docked a star) - and all of it at a reasonable import price...<br /><br />A bit of a bargain frankly - and like a girl who wants to keep on rock 'n me - it's big time recommended.<br /><br />PS: Edsel of the UK have also issued single-CD card digipak remasters of the following albums (February 2011) which match the look of the above issue - they are \\"Book Of Dreams\\" (see separate review), \\"Abracadabra\\", \\"Circle Of Love\\", \\"Live\\", \\"Italian X-Rays\\" and \\"Wide River\\"f-place cover of Sam Cooke's \\"You Send Me\\", but Steve Miller/Jason Cooper original \\"The Window\\" is a great way to finish the record - and it sounds fab too.

B003F256T0|5.0|I got this toy right after I got home from school. I thought it was smaller than I expected, but that didn't matter. The paintjob is wonderful. Articulation is the best I've seen on a DBZ action figure. This came WAY before it was expected. SUCH a great toy. The only problem was that getting the Kamehameha hands on was a problem, and the forearms came off on both arms. Thankfully, the joints can be snapped back into place with no problem. I recommend this to anyone, a collecter, a kid, or a teenager wanting to act like a kid.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|My only gripe with this feature film, was it's not available in 3D.  Still it's very entertaining. Family friendly.   Slice of action, sprinkle some awe and thrilling parts, and add it to a good original modern story.   And that's not all the ingredients.  Very high quality animation/CGI.  Any animation fans should watch this.  Very much worth buying.
B002P4VUMQ|2.0|This was my first purchase of a Jason Mraz CD & DVD. The CD worked fine but was in bad condition. It looked like oil or grease or other contaminants got into the duplicating process somewhere. I tried to wash it off with mild soap and water but it didn't touch it. The DVD was a (dissappointing) different story. It was in the same bad condition (i.e., looked dirty and used) but it didn't play correctly from the first try. It studdered, stopped, started, skipped (there's probably some other 's' words in there). I was not happy because I had to send everything back. I received a prompt credit which is great, but no one likes the irritation of re-packaging and sending stuff back. I haven't purchased a replacement yet (I will, just not from the same vendor). This doesn't change my plan to continue buying from Amazon because everybody has a bad experience sometime. As long as it doesn't become a habit, I prefer to buy from Amazon.
B003D5X3VM|5.0|He had me at \\"I been trying to catch my breath from the illusion that I lost it when you left me\\" in \\"Illusion\\". Thanks to the free download on one of Amazon's samplers I was acquainted with this gifted artist, skilled poet and mesmerizing voice. My second favorite on the album is \\"Magic Cap\\", but even if Gregory Porter had recorded nothing more after \\"Illusion\\" I'd still say he's one of the greatest of all time. Powerful!
B000001Y5D|5.0|I had been trying to find the song What's Up forever, but couldn't.  When I went on Amazon.com little did I know it was right there.  I listen to the song everyday in my car and never get tired of it.  It's a great cd and for the price, you just can't beat it.  I would recommend this cd to others.  Even the kids like it.
B003NTMREM|5.0|First time using Amazon Prime viewing, 1st season of Torchwood, 1st episode.  #1 of everything and I loved it all.  I have been a Prime Time Amazonian for a few years, this will keep me around even longer.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|Not much to say. It's a video of the final season of Lost. The product, though purchased as used, was still in the shrink wrap, as described.
B000F8O35U|1.0|I ordered Jan 23   I went on a long vac just got home Monday  Have not recevied this item yet  I am getting worried it's for a birthday which is tomorrow  other items came promptly
B0049OSQ18|5.0|This is a great album.  It gets back to American roots.  5 stars for sure.  I fell in love with them right before their last album, Hazards of Love, and have listened to all their stuff.  This is one of the best albums.
B002JCSRKC|4.0|As others have said these boots are very light weight. I ordered them in the oyster white color which is a nice cream colored neutral. I live in Northern California and these are great for the rainy season here. I can't imagine them keeping someone particularly warm in snow. As a bit of a random aside, I have noticed that I am prone to giving/receiving static shocks after wearing these indoors on carpet for any length of time, consider yourself warned.
B001FB55H6|5.0|DIRECTOR'S CUT REVIEW (This review contains very minor SPOILERS. I emphasize \\"MINOR\\". I do not give away the ending, nor any key plot elements. Those that have read the graphic novel will hear about some differences. Those unfamiliar with it will largely be none the wiser. All that being said, if you want a 100% untainted fresh look, you might wish to avoid this review.)    Alright, let's get a few things out of the way. I'm late to the review party here, but felt it necessary to praise this film.    That being said, to those unfamiliar with the graphic novel upon which it is based, I can understand how this might be impenetrable to you. Warner Brothers didn't do the general public any favors by marketing this as a generic \\"super-hero\\" movie. It isn't. It's about as far as you can get from it.     Before extolling the positives of this film, I'll first deal with the misconceptions and then the genuine negatives.    Misconceptions and other silly gripes:     -  Again, Warner Brothers tried to mislead the public about what this film was about. Many walked in thinking they were seeing a Batman or Superman clone only to see the protagonists engage in genuinely unseemly behavior. If you were hoodwinked, I'm sorry. But this is meant to be a gritty and dark story. There are no pure \\"heroes\\" even though most of the characters have good intentions. Alan Moore wrote a story that emphasizes human fallibility over the god-like cookie-cutter pure super heroes that had been prevalent for so long. In so doing, he revolutionized the genre. No apologies are necessary. If you want an uplifting story, this is not for you.    -  No small measure of griping was directed at Dr. Manhattan's nudity. His nudity is meant to express his growing distance from humanity. As he becomes less human, he loses normal human notions of modesty and shame. I'll agree that it wasn't explained perfectly in the film. That being said, if you have that much issue with the naked male form, perhaps you should seek counseling.    -  The politics are nonsensical. Absolutely true. Contemporary commentary on Watchmen (the GN) illustrated a lot of praise for the \\"political message\\". If there's a coherent political message in there, I'll freely admit that I've never found it. Any political message intended to be conveyed falls apart quickly upon any real analysis. Alan Moore, for as much as I admire him as a story teller, was never, in my opinion, a brilliant political philosopher. What is left is a strong tale of ethical and moral quandaries. As far as I'm concerned, that's where the story shines.    -  The \\"squid\\". If you've read the story, you know what I'm talking about. If you haven't (and are still reading), skip to the next section. Yes, Snyder chose to get rid of the squid in favor of another plot device. Some fanboys cried foul. I'd argue that they're mostly wrong. The plot device selected in its place works quite well and does not change the impact of the story in any meaningful way.     Genuine gripes (and some that aren't):    - Silk Spectre in Archie: In the GN, there is a scene where young Silk Spectre, attempting to light her cigarette, pushes a button while sitting in an airship. The button depicts an image of flame. She assumes (incorrectly) that it is the button for the cigarette lighter. Instead, she activates the flamethrowers. It is a moment of comic relief in the GN. In the film, due to what I can only guess is the general demonization of smoking that is going around, the scene is changed in a minor but very important way. Silk Spectre is not looking to light a cigarette (because, presumably, that would be bad...despite the film having an R rating). Instead, she impishly pushes a button marked with flame designs on it for no apparent reason. I would have preferred that they cut the scene entirely or stick to the original story rather than transform Silk Spectre from a woman who made an honest mistake into a mischievous bimbo.    - Casting: Overall, it's not bad. Matthew Goode as Ozymandias will disappoint many. His swallowed consonants and underwhelming physique make it tough to accept him as the closest thing to a \\"perfect man\\" that the original story indicates that he is. Malin Akerman performs admirably, for the most part, as the young Silk Spectre, but she is still a bit too young for the role (this only compounds the script-writing sin mentioned in the previous gripe). Patrick Wilson also comes across as slightly too young for his character, the younger Nite Owl, but it's close enough. I had initial reservations about Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan, but I believe that he fills the role quite well (his relatively soft voice is initially off-putting to anyone familiar with the GN, but the distant and emotionless portrayal (that's a compliment for this role) brings it back). Jeffrey Dean Morgan is well cast as the Comedian. Jackie Earle Haley is absolutely brilliant as Rorschach.    - Rorschach scene changes: Without going into any specific details, there are a few scenes that are changed when Rorschach faces villains: prison cell scene 1 (saw rather than torch) and kidnapper scene (axe rather than fire). Honestly I don't know why the changes were made. They seem rather pointless to me, but I'll freely admit that they're more or less lateral steps rather than improvements or detractions. They seem unnecessary, but they don't harm the portrayal or the story in any significant way.    - Bubastas: Fans of the GN will recall that Ozymandias dabbles in genetic engineering. It makes sense that he has a genetically engineered blue tiger with horns (\\"Bubastas\\") as a pet. In the original story, the genetic/bio engineering feeds into the \\"squid\\" story line. With the \\"squid\\" gone and no mention of Ozymandias' hobby of genetic engineering, we're left with an unexplained mutant tiger. It's a minor point, but an illustration of how this film can be impenetrable to those unfamiliar with the GN. Things have been changed at times with no effort to pick up the slack for the now-lost information that was conveyed by such scenes. It would have been better to cut the tiger completely or to include a throwaway line about how Ozymandias dabbles in genetic engineering. Instead, we're left with what I can only assume is well-intentioned fan service that only serves to alienate the uninitiated audience.    - Director's cut does not contain the Black Freighter footage: In the original GN, the story was paralleled quite well by another story called \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\". It worked quite well in the GN, but I do think that the screen version benefits from the absence of the Black Freighter footage.    Finally, the pros: Cinematography is excellent, soundtrack is mostly spot-on to convey the mood intended, story is very strong, acting is mostly well done, and the director's cut restores some footage that expands on and clarifies the story quite well.    Bottom line: This is a story that has long been considered \\"unfilmable\\". I think Snyder proved everyone wrong. This is an admirable effort to portray the Watchmen story that is, while not perfect, better than most fans ever anticipated. I do need to caution that those unfamiliar with the original story may find themselves lost. I think Snyder made every effort to balance sometimes conflicting goals of: staying true to the story, adapting elements that were not really fit for the big screen, and condensing where necessary. At times, exposition to the non-initiated may have suffered as a result of the choices made.
B003L20IFQ|5.0|I am not a fan of scary movies. Not because I'm easily frightened, but the opposite. I don't find movies scary very often. And many horror flicks today go with the \\"disturbing imagery\\" route rather than genuine scares. I rented this movie not expecting much, but I found myself extremely nervous as the film progressed - after it was over I felt honestly shaken.    I believe what made this film so chilling was how easily it could occur. The apathy of corporations, sheer helplessness of an individual facing possible death as well the furious frustrations of those who honestly wish to help, the value of money and public imagery over the lives of people, the injustices of life are all very real.    I have noticed many commenters here are are whining about the ending. I will say I thought the ending was perfect for the film, even if it left me chilled to the bone. It is realistic and very plausible, not a happy-sappy Disney-esqe ending that Hollywood mindlessly delivers in most films.     A great but deeply scary film. I highly reccommend.
B00005B1W7|5.0|This movie was truly like reading a well written book.  Its storyline and characters were so unpredictable and full of surprises. Every character, so well developed, contributed additional meaning to the story.<br /><br />The story itself follows the lives of two separate yet in ways similar men. Beginning at the end of WWII, the story cleverly brings these two men together some 25 years later, pitting them against one another in a trial of epic proportions.<br /><br />The movie just got better and better as it climaxed toward a most rewarding ending.  I haven't seen many movies like this that make you feel like you're reading a novel.  Again, very impressed with how everything developed and played out in the end.  I only wish I had watched it with others instead of alone.  Then again, maybe it was meant to be absorbed alone, like a good book. Simply Outstanding!!!<br /><br />5+ stars
B0046MOVD0|4.0|This movie is really good, but alot of the action seemed like it was filmed specifically for 3D.  You'll know what i'm talking abot when you watch it.  The action is still good, but you can definitely tell that parts were shot just for 3D viewers, and it's bothersome.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|As other reviewers have mentioned... is this thing Big, Quiet, Excellent Cooling, Inexpensive?  YES!!!!  Remove motherboard for install?  PROBABLY, unless your lucky enough to have a case with access to backside of motherboard, still easy enough, it will just take longer to install the fan.    Amd 945 Processor with a mild overclock of 3.3 Ghz with hours of non-stop video processing all 4 cores near or at 100%, temp will reach 45c max with about 80% fan speed, (stock cooler was closer to 60c without overclocking and much louder).    As the title explains, this cooler will let you push your processor without the worries associated with a stock cooler.
0761536434|5.0|this book is absolutely awesome. Who doesn't fall asleep after reading some bs book straining to keep your eyes open? I never experience that with this book,
B000056HE9|5.0|Great movie and Great Story! My Wife and I enjoy this movie classic and a must see for new comers to the movie Classic's of Yesteryear
B003XU75QG|5.0|i was soooo excited when my package finally came!!! there was absolutely NO hassle within any means with the shipping or anything. i had been waiting for this album to come out in the U.S. for a couple of months (while stalking alllll her youtube videos because the iTunes-EP wasn't enough), so i finally got the guts to order it online from the U.K. (even though shortly after i ordered they announced the releasing of it in the U.S. ...bummer). i was nervous at first about ordering on Amazon because i had never done it before. i also had never ordered anything overseas. but the carrier seemed to have a nice rep on here and most every review was positive. even though i waited a week and a half for it in the mail, i got it a week before it came out in the U.S. :]. the price was right, and i have positively no regrets. this album is absolutely amazing. this is REAL music, and is WAAYYY more than i expected. it's original and fresh, yet the classic edgy rock that many have been striving to find in this decade. Taylor and her band are coming up, but i think they deserve so much more credit than they've gotten (even though they've gotten spectacular reviews). BUY THIS ALBUM.
B003TT2X72|5.0|Having already owned and seen this move numerous times and having recently purchased a blu-ray player we decided we needed it in blu-ray.  Wrong!  We didn't see any significant difference between the standard dvd or blu-ray.  Its a great move no matter what media you're viewing!
B002RI9XOW|4.0|Never saw the movie from start to finish, so the book was fresh for me. A nice read, gets you thinking about life, especially if you're a guy who has been through some relationships....
B0000074CU|4.0|The sound quality is not the best, which can be forgiven, it was 40 year ago! The guitar work though is blistering as usual. It is sad that Rory stole the show at the Isle of Wright listen to the gutair work here to understand why. What's going on is a great opener, Sinner Boy has some sick slide and the intro to I Feel So Good is pure joy!
1594202842|5.0|I loved this book as a story and a glimpse into other parenting styles.  I find the parenting aspect scary but also so very interesting.  I give her a lot of credit for being so honest about herself and her experiences throughout the story.
B002MJV7JA|5.0|Love the dvd! I am a big time Kardashianaholic so of course i am satisfied with the product.  It took longer than usaul for it to arrive but all in all i am completely satisfied.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I bought the History HD Blu-Ray \\"The Universe\\" thinking that it was gonna knock my socks off and was disappointed.I'm a huge fan of History/Discovery/BBC productions and this is why. This Series proves that when the BBC takes it's time and puts forth the effort, they truely have the best production in the world. The production levels are right up there with the Walking with... series.     If you know someone who is just refusing to make the jump to HD or Blu-Ray, show them this. After seeing this, they will want one. This shows what HDTV & Blu -Ray is all about. I highly recommend this series even if you don't like this type of programming. If for nothing else to show off you HD equipment. It's that amazing!
B004JMZPJG|5.0|The Case Logic DCB-306 SLR camera holster is a black nylon case that is what I would call medium sized.  It's just about the right size to fit a Single-Lens Reflex or digital SLR (DSLR) camera.  I have both a film and a digital SLR Nikon, and each fits fine in the case, with a zoom lens attached (which is important, since many people use just a zoom lens on their camera, and one doesn't want to have to remove a lens just to get it into a bag).<br /><br />It's a padded case, which is important to protect your expensive camera.  It has two zippered side pockets, one on each side, for putting memory cards or other items in.  The pockets are also big enough to fit more three rolls of film, for those of us who still use film cameras.  There is also a handy zippered pocket in the top flap of the bag, which is a great place for a memory card or something similarly thin.<br /><br />I might be able to squeeze my flash unit into the main bag with my camera, or in one of the side pockets, but it would be a tight fit.  This is more of a problem with my film camera, since the DSLR has a pop-up flash.  I wish there was a larger pocket that would hold the flash unit.  The pockets are thinly padded, which is a plus.<br /><br />The case has a handle on the top so one could carry the case that way, though I suppose it's more to aid in helping pull this good-sized case out of a larger bag, say one's backpack.  There's an unpadded shoulder strap as well, which is how I suspect most people will use to carry the bag.  The case also has a large loop in the back, so one can thread a belt through it, and carry the bag that way.  I like the fact that the belt loop is sewn to the bag both top and bottom.  I've seen bag that have a velcro attachment for the belt loop; I worry about that arrangement being too prone to falling apart, dashing one's camera to the ground.  It's very important to make the attachment that way, I think, for a large and heavy DSLR camera.<br /><br />The only quibbles is that I have are that I have to push my flash unit to get it in the side pocket, and the shoulder strap could have been padded.  Carrying a heavy camera on a hike, or even all day at the mall, would be more comfortable with a padded strap.  And I'm worried about damaging my flash unit in the too-small side pouch.<br /><br />Over-all I'd give this bag four-and-one-half stars.  The bag is the right size; not too small, nor too bulky.  The stitching is nice and straight, and the bag looks as though it is very well made.  I have no worries that the bag will come apart, risking my expensive equipment.  Having the bag right on my side using the shoulder strap or belt loop means that it's always handy.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.  This is a very nice bag!e to push my flash unit to get it in the side pocket, and the shoulder strap could have been padded.  Carrying a heavy camera on a hike, or even all day at the mall, would be more comfortable with a padded strap.  And I'm worried about damaging my flash unit in the too-small side pouch.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|I have been a huge horror movie fan since i was 7 years old (41 years old now), and for some reason the \\"zombie\\" genre is my absolute favorite... I was very interested when i heard they were doing the series. I had also read the article in \\"fangoria\\" magazine as well. I was totally HOOKED from the first episode... I love it. I am sooooo looking forward to the next season!!!!!!!! I was so desperate to record it as it was showing. My dvd player had broken, and was recording it on VHS hahaha. I still had some old tapes. hahaha.. I can't wait for it to come out on dvd.. :)<br /><br />thanks for reading!!!<br />zombie fan
159562015X|2.0|The book is short in length and a fast read.  The thesis of the book is you will create your maximum amount successes and accomplishments by continuously focusing on, and investing in, your strengths.  The book comes with a code key to take the StrengthsFinder 2.0 Assessment.<br /><br />I received value from taking the assessment.  The assessment results shed light on what was already illuminated.  What I received was a clearer understanding of what I already knew.  In direct contrast to the above outcome, I was very disappointed with the author's unwillingness to provide assistance in converting assessment results into actionable life and career planning.<br /><br />The supporting documents, resources, and tools are pathetic.  In summary, the overall experience was a major letdown and left me feeling like I had been scammed.  Based on website pricing and service offering, a customer who purchases the book and the assessment will have to pay hundreds of dollars to get deliverable and usable value from their prior investment of time, effort, and money.  In addition, nowhere on the website is there invitation, or a way, to provide feedback.  I had to use a backdoor method of providing feedback.

1932100660|5.0|Imagine if there was a diet that could claim to: prevent and treat heart disease; promote long term-weight loss and long-term health; allow diabetics to get off of their medications; have an incredibly effective anti-cancer effect; prevent the development of autoimmune diseases like Diabetes I, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis, lower the risks associated with chronic bone, kidney, eye, and brain diseases (including osteoporosis, kidney stones, macular degeneration, cataracts, cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease and stroke). And, imagine if this diet did not require counting calories, adhering to rigid rules, and popping endless supplements, but firmly supported the belief that:<br />\\"Eating should be an enjoyable and worry-free experience, and shouldn't rely on deprivation. Keeping it simply is essential if we are to enjoy our food.\\"<br /><br />Believe it or not, this miracle diet does indeed exist. And, even more incredibly, its guidelines can be summarized in one sentence:<br />\\"Eat a whole foods, plant-based diet, while minimizing the consumption of refined foods, added salt, and added fats.\\"<br /><br />Dr T. Collin's ground-breaking, comprehensive _The China Study_ does a wonderful job presenting the indisputable data showing the endless benefits of such a whole foods, plant-based diet. The highly readable book is divided into four parts: Part I presents the findings of the China Study; Part II shows how nutrition is directly related to \\"diseases of affluence\\" including heart disease, obesity, diabetes, common cancers like breast/prostate/large bowel cancers, autoimmune diseases such as Diabetes I, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis, and bone/kidney/eye/brain diseases; Part III summarizes the principles of food and health and provides simple guidelines for \\"how to eat\\"; and Part IV exposes the dark side of science and reveals how government, industry, and big medicine repeatedly put the health of their profits above the health of our nation.<br /><br />Our nation's health could drastically improve if more people were to take the time to read, and truly digest, the fountain of information and wisdom shared in this book. Even just reading the following eight principles of food and health (pp. 225-240) could dramatically improve someone's health, while demystifying the basics of nutrition:<br />1. Nutrition represents the combined activities of countless food substances. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.<br />2. Vitamin supplements are not a panacea for good health.<br />3. There are virtually no nutrients in animal-based foods that are not better provided by plants.<br />4. Genes do not determine disease on their own. Genes function only be being activated, or expressed, and nutrition plays a critical role in determining which genes, good and bad, are expressed.<br />5. Nutrition can substantially control the adverse effects of noxious chemicals.<br />6. The same nutrition that prevents disease in early stages (before diagnosis) can also halt or reverse disease in later stages (after diagnosis).<br />7. Nutrition that is truly beneficial for one chronic disease will support health across the board.<br />8. Good nutrition creates health in all areas of our existence. All parts are interconnected.<br /><br />The book is filled with life-changing insights about the connections between nutrition and health.

B001PPLIFU|5.0|i confess i had a feeling before watching this movie that daniel craig would ruin it... OMG it was the opposite! it's fresh, violent, trilled, action pumped!!!  very higly recomended!!!
B004NYQYNQ|2.0|Oh, I wanted so much to love this album as I enjoyed seeing Adele on recent late-night TV and on the delightful NPR interview last week -- I'm always up for a well-sung soul session, and here is a young singer who professes her admiration for Etta James and her desire to stay true to her artistic vision rather than cater to the whims of pop music. Adele seems to have it all together, but apparently this self-sufficiency and taste does not extend to her selection of a producer.<br /><br />The songs themselves are fine, lyrically falling somewhere between Taylor Swift and the early Alanis in terms of what a heartbroken 21-year old can express in song.  The arrangements range from retro-soul to bouncy dance tracks, but the musical settings often don't have much resonance with the lyrics.<br /><br />The real problem here is the sound, specifically the sound of Adele's voice.  In live performance you can tell she has an expressive, nuanced instrument, but you'd never tell from hearing this.  The vocal tracks on 21 are over-processed, compressed, and somehow distorted, stripped of emotion.  The result is not quite as soulless as your generic auto-tuned pop song, but by the end of each tune your ears hurt and the instrumental breaks for the next tune come as blessed relief.  After a few tracks the album becomes hard to listen to. This is not the experience a vocal record should be.
B0015DROBO|2.0|I don't know what it is.  Maybe it was the amount of expectation that was placed on it.  But I just wasn't all that impressed.  I mean, I can't say that none of it was entertaining.  But I guess I was looking for a phenomenon, and I left wondering \\"what was so special?\\"  I want to be fair to the fact that it was my own expectations that were let down and it is not necessarily in the genre of books that I typically read.  And obviously there are people out there that love the book.  So this was just my personal experience...I was not especially impressed and felt little desire to read the other books.  What desire did exists was more of a curiosity that maybe it got better, which is the main thing that made me finish the book in the first place.

1595141715|5.0|* there are some spoilers in here, not enough to ruin the book AT ALL....  but still *<br /><br />1. Let me start off by saying I'm 17 , and before I read this book I got a feeling that I just didn't belong. I felt lost and that the days were just passing by and I was in it. Hannah talks about how she kind of felt used how she was just a reputation- a reputation that started based on her body. I feel like that a lot and when I read this book - I'll be honest it almost made me more depressed - but it harbored emotions and let things out that I didn't really know were there until reading this.<br /><br />2. The format. I loved how this book was written - sometimes you got so into hannahs words you forgot to comprehend them , reading clays thoughts reminds you just what you were thinking.<br /><br />3. the subject. period.<br /><br />4. The fact that the author doesn't hold back. The craziest scenarios will be shown - which almost gives you a thought that you actually understood why hannah gave up.<br /><br />5. The fact that when you end the book- at least I didn't think oh my gosh someone should have saved her... I mean of course there were tons of parts where I wondered wow why couldnt anyone see her pain/ and try to stop it without ending everything for her.<br /><br />6. The realness, i could relate to every thing. Every part flashed me back to a personal experience for me or a friend.<br /><br />7. the suspense.<br /><br />8. amazing book<br /><br />9. amazing book.<br /><br />10. AMAZING BOOK ( just those words are enough i promise to get this book )<br /><br />11. the visible hate from her classmates i could relate to that , it was cool seeing how much i felt i related to her.<br /><br />12. the fact that like i said before it digs deep - def. makes you think.<br /><br />13. YOUR LIFE WILL BE CHANGED> I can't tell you how much of a diff. you think - how a simple hello could save someones life - and how stepping out of your comfort zone as weird as you might be feeling could be what someone is dying for you to do- you realize that life is hard , point blank - EVERY PARENT NEEDS TO READ THIS because maybe just maybe they might see an ounce of what really goes on in school , esp. for girls. It just really helps you realize how things happen for a reason , how peoples action will result in sometimes even worse things .<br /><br />an amazing book is all i can say , def. def. buy it.<br /><br />one thing i want to say is that one of the tags is bullying , i can understand how someone might interpret this book for something about a girl being bullied- but no not really, actually she just wasn't loved ... actually she was the farthest thing from being bullied she was well liked but never knew who truly liked her, never knew her purpose , never knew if a guy liked her or thought she was hot, she just was sick and tired of that feeling - a feeling that is all too familiar for me.- EVERY PARENT NEEDS TO READ THIS because maybe just maybe they might see an ounce of what really goes on in school , esp. for girls.

B000GFLEBI|1.0|well, it's kinda hard to review something that you never got to watch because the seller forgot to mention that you need the right player that supports hd dvd's. the seller has yet to contact me to correct the issue;nor has amazon made any attempts to contact me regarding the issue i have with this seller,beware of all purchases you make at amazon.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|what is wrong with you people who said this book was not goood? this book interested me and i a. only ten. listen if you are not sure if you want to read this book because of the reviews dont listen to them. this book is awesome. but here is a warning if blood makes you sick do not read the birth scene. the honemoon is also a little inapporpiate. but i love how bella would risk her life just to have a baby!  she is so not selfish. and here is a heads up:  edward is hot and jacob is not.  read this book. if you do not agree with me then write a review to m saying how you do or dont. so reply back!
B004EBT5CU|4.0|This album is utterly beautiful and sad. It starts off strong with \\"Rolling in the Deep\\", then delves into the sassy \\"Rumour Has It\\". From then on, there's no stopping Adele. With the help of Rick Rubin, Ryan Tedder (from OneRepublic), and Dan Wilson, Adele has created songs that allow her to shine vocally and express herself emotionally in a universal way. There is no denying Adele has a voice so perfect and stunning, but it's her ability to put her pain, joy and memories in a song, and paint pictures with her lyrics, that make her one of the best artists of the past decade. Standouts are definitely the bluesy \\"One and Only\\", and the gut-wrenching \\"Someone Like You\\". Every song on the album is special, but Adele stumbles a bit with her cover of \\"Lovesong\\" by the Cure, which to me seemed boring and too long, as well as \\"I'll Be Waiting\\", which doesn't suit Adele as well as it could have. I would not be surprised if this album, and its components, were the highlight of next year's Grammy Awards. Then again, thinking back to what the Grammys have become, I might be surprised. Nevertheless, this is an album for anybody who knows what love is. Or at least wants to remember.     **Check out bonus tracks, such as \\"I Found a Boy\\", and \\"Hiding my Heart\\", a cover of Brandi Carlile. Both would have fit perfectly into the standard album, and \\"Hiding my Heart\\", which should have definitely replaced \\"Lovesong\\" as the cover song on the album.
B004G6009U|5.0|It isn't often that families actually get to go to the movie together and all enjoy the show.  I took two daughters and 5 grandchildren.  The movie was a resounding success.  I truly believe Disney has returned to its glory with the movie Tangled.  The Princess and the Frog was way too dark, and it was hard for children to understand.  However, with Tangled, the fun has returned to the movies.  The music, action, and characters all worked to bring the movie alive.  My grandchildren, who ranged from 2-6 years old, were held captive by the story.  Yes, the \\"mother\\" was disturbing, but it took just a quick explanation that she was not a real mother to Rapunzel because she did not treat her like a mother should.  It's a shame that others have found fault with this movie.  It beat the competition hands-down. I am a teacher of middle-school children, and I recommended it to all of them. Many came back and told me how much fun it was to watch.  I am hopeful that more movies will continue in this vein.  I'm really tired of dirty language and situations of questionable morals as the fare that is dished up for our children.  This movie brings back good feelings when good wins.
B00164KYV4|4.0|This is a great romantic comedy.  Amazon had it for a great price.  There was a crack in the back of the case when I received it, but other than that I'm happy with the purchase.
B004MMEIK0|5.0|I was giggling the whole time. There were parts that were serious without distracting from the story and I loved it. This was a really great freebie. Im definitely checking out her other books.
B001QKSWOE|2.0|I LOVE the One thru 10 books-- but this book is a complete let down . Just like Motor Mouth was.    I know it is fiction--but this is grade school imagination stuff..
B004A7NDPI|4.0|I cannot quantify how much I adore this show! Filmed as three ~90 min episodes, Sherlock is as much a modern mystery as a character study. Sherlock Holmes is complex, vivid, and charming. Watson is portrayed as an Afghanistan War veteran who misses the action.<br />The Blind Banker focuses on Chinese cypher that Sherlock must unravel to explain the deaths of several unrelated people and the break in at a bank. The filming is vivid and fascinating.
006176759X|4.0|It's not the nest read in the world but it held my interest well enough. It was so easy to read that it was a bit of fresh air. I sat there an finished it in one day. I will be reading the second book because, although it could have been better, it was a wonderful debut novel for Lauren. I look forward to seeing what else she can do.
0399156577|1.0|This book was selected for our book club.  My personal rule is you have to read the whole book.  I couldn't.  I skipped big sections at a time.  I have never read Nora Roberts before, and I definitely will not ever again.  The characters were wooden at best, and totally unlikeable.  I am a dog lover, but I didn't even like the dogs in this story.  They were like robodogs.  The story varied between extremely tedious banality to short spurts of cruelty.  Ugh. This was a poorly written formula romance story with a formula murder mystery tossed in. 488 pages of ... not much.
B003X27L9U|4.0|I must admit that I enjoyed this book much better when they were trapped. Once they escaped, for me, it became much less engaging, borderline boring.    The premise is fascinating and I was in awe of how Ma managed to entertain a child for almost every hour of the day. That takes lots of energy and creativity.     I thought Old Nick's capture was anti-climactic. I realize the story is from a child's perspective but I would've liked to know a bit more about Nick.    I tired of Jack's gibberspeech around chapter four. It was tolerable when they were in their own private room. Once he discovered Outside, I quickly tired of his speech coupled with his constant description of everyday mundane experiences.      Overall nice read. I think I would have liked it better if it had wrapped up quicker after the climax/escape.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|There were two artists I was waiting for CD's from this year.  Aimee Duffy and Adele Adkins...Duffy's second CD was rough at best, entirely disappointing.  Adele's cd on the other hand is an artist in the making.  From the first song \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" she sets a tone of great music and great writing.  The best songs, \\"Set Fire to Rain\\",\\"He Won't Go\\", \\"I'll be Waiting\\",and \\"Someone Like You\\" all show great maturity as an artist and songwriter.  But the absolute gem on this album is \\"One and Only\\".  I would buy this cd just for this song alone.  This second cd is very different from the first as it is not so acoustic and personal.  The theme of love lost on this cd demands a different approach and Adele totally nails it with her voice and production.  With so many mediocre cd's out there it is really great to hear an artist that is soaring in creativity.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|I love the historical and poetry references. The love story was romantic as well. I was well into it until the end. The book leaves you hanging at the end which leaves an unsatisfied feeling of being robbed of a full story.
B003UYV08E|2.0|I felt that they slacked on the first Iron Man, slacked, but all in all it was very entertaining and quite enjoyable (Hey, at least it wasn't Spider Man 3)  Iron Man 2 however, it just sad.  Its really awful.  I'm going to try to break it down as simply as I can.    1- Tony Stark is played by an incredible actor.  Robert Downey Jr. is an example of how poor writers can just ruin a movie no matter who is in the cast.  Tony is supposed to be an arogant, witty, quick-tongued, cocky guy, but Iron Man 2 is just one lousy attempt at a one-liner.  Nothing made me laugh.  The script should be burned, buried, and forgotten.  Stark was never meant to sound like a washed up, smart @$$ stand-up wannabe.    2- The title should have been The Avengers feat. Iron Man.  I truly want to see something develop out of all this Avengers hype, but my lord.  The world is in perile, Tony's body is poisoning itself to death, but every 3 seconds Nick Fury comes running up with a contract \\"Tony please sign here, sign here!\\"  Just too much of it in this movie.    3- Plot needs to get original now.  Just as in Iron Man 1, Tony is having some kind of grave problem with his technology, he is trying to create some magical solution, someone has stolen his technology, found a weakness and is now using it against him.  Exact same plot basically across both movies.  For half this movie Tony is in his lab trying to create a new element! Not fighting crime, but getting drunk and making elements...    4- Speaking of the drunk.  The scene where Stark and James Rhodes (War Machine) fight it out in Tony's house while Tony is drunk and just completely destroying what little shred of respect I had left for this movie, stops everything dead.  The scene is horrible, the music is atrocious, I could have lived without it.  At least War Machine was around though, somebody had to do work.    5- This is one of the biggest let downs I had with the movie, minor and stupid yes but a let down.  Ivan Vanko (Rourke) is working to create an army of \\"Iron Men\\".  At the beginning of the movie he is seen with a cockatiel bird on his shoulder.  When asked by his partners if he needs anything to help him work Ivan replies that he wants his \\"bird\\".  They get him a bird and he is EXTREMELY upset that it wasn't his actual, personal bird.  I thought AHHH the bird remembers all the Stark Technology plans and he needs it to finish his work! Genius!  Nope, not the case...he just wants his bird. Was there nothing better to anger Whiplash with?! Is he going around slappin race cars left and right because he lost his bird?! Get real...I would have died a happier man had that been left out.    On the upside (if there is one), Iron Man 2 is visually stunning!  If you would like to see IMO a movie that has set a new standard for effects and filming this is it.  A baboon could have directed a better movie, but at least they made garbage look incredible.  You also have Rourke who plays a great villian.  I'm really pleased with his role.  Some people say he doesn't have enough lines but I think that is what adds to his character so much.  Awesome job, two thumbs up!  You get to see some of Black Widow too, at least someone was a good superhero.    I wouldn't waste my money. Netflix, rent, whatever.  Don't buy.  I know a few people who liked the movie, but I honestly think they just hadn't been watching movies lately and wanted to see something.  Maybe little kids would think this was soooo awesome, I just can't see the good in it.
B004L3AR0K|5.0|I'm not going to write a 50 paragraph report on this movie. Many people watch a movie with the intent to write a review hence why some are so negative. if you simply watch a movie to kill boredom you may actually enjoy it.<br /><br />Now, I like his movie because it isn't just a romance film, it adds drama, yes all romance films have drama, but this one adds an illness. I just love Anne Hathaway, I think she does a great job in this film. Some funny moments, some tearful moments, just a great movie, in my opinion.
0060557818|4.0|The novel is a relatively quick but always entertaining read. The characters are enjoyable, but they are not as fleshed out as other memorable protagonists from other Gaiman works. The story itself is entertaining, and the pacing is speedy. Overall, this is something to enjoy lightly at the beach or on the bus.
B0042TV4IC|5.0|Don't be fooled into thinking that this is just another English Period Piece.<br />The book(that this series is based on) might have been written describing the late 19th century Oxford shire England but the problems encountered by the characters are truly 21th Century problems.<br />I was hooked after the 1st Episode of Series One.<br />Series 2 and 3 are even better. I am awaiting the arrival of Series 4 on DVD.<br />Acting,Locations,Costumes are all superb.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|**WOW!!**  Absolutely the most AWESOMELY HUGE experience I've seen in a movie since Titanic!!  And much more than a movie - A HUGE MESSAGE to mankind with clips of James Cameron in the Rain Forest where he got the original idea for [[ASIN:B0044XV3R8 Avatar (Three-Disc Extended Collector's Edition)]].  Everyone needs to see this and the concept of \\"Eywa\\". NOT an animated sci-fi flik - tons of work and effort went into this movie with the acting too - check that out too - amazing behind the scenes extra footage.  OUTSTANDINGLY BEAUTIFUL COLORS, CREATURES & FOREST, OMG!!  The BluRay HD is incredible and I literally saw things for the first time in this cut I never new existed in the regular movie!! **AN ULTIMATE & UNIQUE MASTERPIECE!!**  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT - IT'S NOW MY FAVORITE OF ALL MOVIES!!...And I agree Sam Worthington should have won an Oscar for his outstanding and grilling performance!!  My wonderful SON who'd working his butt off through college gave me this for Christmas along with an HD TV - Quite a SPECIAL GIFT in so many ways from a TERRIFIC BOY, also worth a RAVING review!! (\\"My BABY\\"!!)
B004DWKO8Y|4.0|Prior to the release of What If..., I must've read 3 or 4 glowing reviews on different sites extolling this as a top-notch effort, a \\"return to form\\" for one of the best (if somewhat unsung) bands of the '80s.  In truth, I agonized over whether I should just download the album (which was available online 2/8) or wait an extra week to get the actual cd/dvd package (solely to see the \\"Making of What If...\\" part of the dvd).<br /><br />I opted for the cd/dvd package.  Honestly, the documentary is only about 10 minutes long, so it's hardly worth twice the asking price of the MP3 album...but I don't even care.  Why?  Because the glowing reviews I'd read were spot-on.  This album is solid, from beginning to end.<br /><br />Billy Sheehan and Paul Gilbert are about as good as it gets in the bass/guitar categories for rock bands, and they do not disappoint here at all.  Being a drummer myself, I was also impressed with Pat Torpey's playing.  And Eric Martin sounds EXACTLY the same as always...something that can't be said for very many (if any) other frontmen of his era.<br /><br />Congrats to the guys in Mr. Big for putting together an excellent album.
B000I0QL82|5.0|this is a classic i used to watch as a little girl with my dad and now the tradition can continue with my children and grandchildren
B00377V6J2|5.0|It is simply amazing that these recordings went unpublished, for so many years.  This is definitive Albert King, with some of the best Stevie Ray Vaughan ever.     The collection of collaborative jams are a blues lovers dream!
B000PMLFRA|5.0|\\"Q: Why aren't Blu-ray Disc movies available in \\"Full Screen\\" format?  A. \\"Full Screen\\" movies have been modified to make them fill the nearly square dimensions of a standard-definition TV screen. Blu-ray Disc movies are intended primarily for display on HDTV screens. Therefore, since all current HDTV screens are designed for the 16:9 theatrical aspect ratio, Blu-ray Disc movies are delivered in that aspect ratio. In essence, 16:9 is the \\"full-screen\\" format for HDTV screens, so 4:3 \\"pan & scan\\" versions are unnecessary. However, since many films are originally shot in aspect ratios wider than 16:9, you may still observe black bars at the top and bottom of the screen when viewing certain movies.\\"      The listing of the Full screen Aspect ratio has to be a mistake.  I have never seen a Bluray movie that was full screen.  It would kind of defeat the whole purpose of Bluray, would it not?  I don't think the Bluray spec even allows for the full screen aspect ratio.  Its seems amazon has pulled the aspect ratio, I no longer see it listed. Their is NO way these will be in full screen.
B00013RC8O|5.0|Excellent quality DVD of a classic movie.  I have seen this movie hundreds of times since I saw it at the drive-in movies in 1971.  Item is a bargain!  Seller is 5 stars all the way, can't go wrong here.
B001W79MB8|5.0|This is a masterpiece, It is so vivid and in depth. The Animation alone will leave you saying WOW!    As for the story, They do not get much better than this, this is a must see movie for anyone.
B000FC2PKG|4.0|This was the first book I downloaded on my new Kindle, and finished it in a day and 1/2!  I couldn't put it down.  If you like mysteries, with plot twists, this book is for you.
0143034901|1.0|I tried to like this book, I really did, but after reading a little more than half, I FINALLY gave myself permission to end my suffering!  Like many of the other one-star reviewers, I had assumed \\"Shadow\\" had to be a great book based on rave reviews.  I have no idea what there was to like about this book; it was boring, overly wordy, excruciatingly long, and the characters were not interesting or likeable.  I'm glad I gave it up!
B004DMNT2W|4.0|This camcorder case is well-made. It is designed for HD, hard drive type camcorders. The padding and stitching seem of better quality than the average cases and the price reflects that. There is an additional elastic strap within to secure the camera. There are 2 small pockets within for memory cards... they would not be adaptable to other uses.  There is no section of the case for an additional battery... though, some cameras may leave room for one. No shoulder strap is included. This is a well-made and handy case. I would look for a sale as over twenty dollars seems a bit too high. Best wishes...
0393338827|4.0|Fantastic book that explains in a simplified manner how greed and corruption on Wall Street eventually lead to the mortgage meltdown.  The book chronicles several key players who saw the crash coming and bet against Wall Street's mortgage back securities with credit default swaps - making hundreds of millions of dollars in the process.  I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to understand the causes of the Great Recession.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|All I can say is... wow. I cannot believe how young this woman is. Her songs and voice are heartbreakingly soulful and wise and her music brings chills to my spine. I am a new fan of Adele and can't wait to see what she comes up with next!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I loved Adele's first album, her voice is so haunting, and it does sound like she's a woman twice her age sitting at the edge of a bar, her bourbon-soaked voice catching your ear at once, and then cutting through you as she loses all restraint and hits those high notes with effortless resonance and clarity.<br /><br />This album, on first listen, grabs you and yoiu're left almost shaken by the honesty and beauty of her lyrics and melodies. I first heard the single, and then Set Fire to the Rain, and within minutes I knew I would have to own this album. If you've ever been wronged, if you've ever been used, or taken advantage of - Adele sings for you, her soulful voice righting all those moments you were left speechless with hurt. This is an album that becomes an immediate entry for album of the year, and will likely prove to be a classic in the years to come. Greatness cannot be explained, it's an odd mixture of authenticity and melodies hitting the listener's ears at a precise moment so that you feel the music is bigger than you, and comes from something greater than even the singer. This meets all those standards.<br /><br />If you're skeptical at all, just give the songs a listen, they'll make the decision for you.
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|This is an excellent John Wayne movie which I watch whenever I need to lift my spirit.  Lots of light humor and great acting on the part of the main characters. Most importantly the video transfer is excellent.  Highly recommend this DVD as it is the only one authorized by the Wayne Foundation and is a BATJAC production. Not your typical John Wayne western.
0307595579|4.0|Under $99 dollars, is not what this set costs here. If you like this author, check around and you will be surprised. Amazon is clearly ahead in the value market with this set.  I enjoy the female lead kicking ass and taking names in this particular set of stories. The revenge in the first book was succint and to the point. Justice was delivered with the two malevolent male malefactors.  Have fun, I have.
B004OOVJ1M|5.0|Was surprised to see no one had reviewed this DVD. absolutely terrific video. have seen this film 20+ times and never tire of it. one of the first 'reality' movies it provides an exceptionally open and honest view of the final days of a long and once loving and productive 'marriage'. the best and most underrated rock & roll movie
B0039V8NJC|4.0|The Reluctant Fundamentalist by Mohsin Hamid is an incredible, mind altering story filled with ominous suspense, and an attentive outside view of America.<br /><br />The story is told in an interesting way, narrated by Changez to an American acquaintance while sitting at a caf&eacute; in Lahore. I both liked and disliked this style of storytelling. In the beginning I had a difficult time connecting with the characters, but that changed as I came to the middle and end of the story. The conversational tone made the book quick and easy to read.<br />Changez tells his story of attending college in America and excelling in the corporate world. After 9/11, though, his life in the US begins to unravel as he feels torn between his roots in Pakistan and his new life in America. All the while, Changez engages in a doomed love affair with Erica, this golden girl drowning in her love for her dead boyfriend.<br /><br />I feel as though the relationship Changez had with Erica was a metaphor for his relationship with America and being American. He fell fast and hard, quickly becoming a part of her world. He accompanied her to many events and parties and was accepted easily, but still felt like an outsider on some level. After 9/11 she withdrew from him, making him less a part of her world and then shutting him out altogether. She longed for something that was no longer attainable; Changez longed to feel a part of her world again, even if that meant pretending to be someone he wasn't.<br /><br />I loved seeing America through Changez's eyes. I thought that reading this book wouldn't alter my perspective too much because I'm a fan of novels set in the Middle East. I thought my perspectives had been changed a long while ago. In the story, Changez talks about how little America experiences the effects of war at home. War isn't fought on our soil. We don't fear for our lives and our safety everyday like so many other people around the world. Changez's home country of Pakistan was NOT at war with America or Afghanistan, yet they felt the impact much more deeply than we did as Americans. In this way, my view of the world has been profoundly altered. I would recommend this book if only just for the new outlook.yet they felt the impact much more deeply than we did as Americans.

0062024329|2.0|This is one of thsoe books like [[ASIN:0743278909 Jonathan Livingston Seagull]] that seems deep at one point in your life because it manages to tell you everything that you kind of believe already and reinforce your sense that you are a beautiful little flower but ultimatley proves idiotic upon reflection. I never read the actual book btu I wouldn't have gotten through it at first since I can't stand a book that must repeat its MESSAGE over and over again. FOllow your personal legend. Follow your personal legend.    Now if you say \\"follow your personal legend\\" fifteen times in the next minute, you will have a rough idea of how bad that term sounds in reptition. This entire book is a rehash of your most egotistical musings. You are on this world to make money. You are getting into the mystical stuff because ti will give you spiritual contact highs.    Oh and Alchemists are magic.    This is a dumb book that is written for college freshmen and no one else. Avoid.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I rented this DVD earlier, but never watched it, as my husband told me the critics' reviews were not very good, and it had been a busy week. But I am SO GLAD that I rented it again! I loved the movie from the beginning. Every actor was fabulous, but especially both Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend. I was immediately taken in to the film with the wonderful way the story was told and acted out. Although I am far from a historian, I know very well the story of Victoria and found the interpretation of the screenplay very acceptable! If you love period dramas, you will love this!
B002ZG99TA|5.0|This is a taut and suspenseful action thriller with excellent lead performances from Denzel Washington, Chris Pine, and Rosario Dawson.<br /><br />Based on a true incident, the film tells the tale of a runaway freight train that threatens to derail around a curve in Stanton, PA, spewing its load of toxic chemicals on the surrounding community.<br /><br />Bucking the unfortunate trend of DVDs packing minimal extras, this disc includes both a commentary by director Tony Scott as well as an informative \\"making-of\\" featurette that impresses the viewer with the scope of the production and the director's insistence on shooting as much as possible \\"in the camera\\" -- i.e. no CGI effects.<br /><br />Though stopping the runaway train is the primary story here, the vet engineer and rookie conductor played by Washington and Pine have credible back stories that give their relationship an additional edge.  Dawson lends strong support as the dispatcher who is trying to keep track of the situation as it spins out of control due to an arrogant and inept engineer and bad calls by a bottom-line-driven railroad exec.<br /><br />Action thriller fans will be munching fistfuls of popcorn as the runaway train picks up speed, and fans of good acting will appreciate the star turns of the leads.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I'm not really even a fan of blue grass/folk/rock type of genre but I absolutely fell in love with this band and album.  It's been a long time since I've actually become emotional from listening to an album, but the melodies and the heartfelt lyrics almost sent chills down my spine. It's so refreshing to hear a young band like this that write and sing purposeful, deep, and beautiful songs.  I had to buy the whole album on itunes, every song is masterfully crafted.
B002GTZSZU|4.0|Amadeus is one of my favorite films, and one that I watch annually at least. I had read reviews regarding the Director's Cut version of the film on Blu-ray, and they were not favorable. So, I waited and waited for the theatrical version to be released on Blu-ray to no avail. Finally, mostly because of the price reduction of this version - I finally purchased it. Having watched the Director's Cut, I fully agree with the consensus of negative reviews for it. This version adds about 20 minutes to the theatrical version, and I didn't find that a single added minute did anything to add value to the story. I won't go so far as to say it ruins it. This film is so good that even poorly added footage can't change its overall excellence, but there are portions of the added footage that do diminish the story in my opinion. We don't really see anything in this added footage that tells us more than we knew (at least not beneficially), but rather most of it just draws out a particular story element with superfluous information.<br /><br />The Blu-ray is great for visual and audio quality, so it may be considered worth it for that - but don't buy it because you think 20 minutes of added footage will enhance the experience of the movie. It just doesn't.
031606792X|1.0|When writing the concluding book of a successful series, wouldn't you expect an author to put their best work into it in order to finish the series with a rousing explosion of drama/romance/action - whatever made the previous books so popular?  Instead, Ms. Meyer presented us with Breaking Dawn (BD), which has little to do with the previous three books except characters with the same names.  It's escapist reading like the first three books, but there is so much wrong with it the only way you could escape into it is if you can completely ignore inconsistency, plot holes, mischaracterization and immorality.  Ms. Meyer basically ruined her own series with this book.    And if you haven't read the book yet there are    ************SPOILERS BELOW**************    Rules are important, especially to the sci-fi/fantasy/supernatural genres.  It's the rules that make it interesting, otherwise we'd all just read fiction set in the real world.  But when the author is inconsistent and breaks their own rules the story becomes unbelievable.  Ms. Meyer established a number of rules for her world, then when it became expedient for her story she broke them.  Here's some examples:    The author established that vampires sparkle because their tissues crystallized in the conversion process.  That's why male and female vampires do not change.  This means NO PREGNANCY WAS POSSIBLE.  In that one rule, the author eliminated vampire babies, including human/vampire hybrids.  Later on she tries to justify it by saying Edward was still a virgin when he was converted, and still had junk in his trunk.  Then how does she explain Joham the serial hybrid maker?  By that logic after one shot he should have been done.  Furthermore, even if this logic worked, the baby would NOT be a vampire/human hybrid because the stored sperm would still be HUMAN.    Newborn vampires are bloodthirsty and out of control.  That concept is repeated through three books and a novella.  Yet when Bella is reborn, she skipsthis stage entirely.  Why?  Because, in the author's words, \\"she's a really stubborn girl\\".  This strength of mind is supposed to be enough that she can withstand the physical demands of her newborn body.  But this has not been sufficiently established before BD.  Where was this strength of mind when she becomes a zombie and can't remember four months of her life?  Where was this strength of mind when she was scared to death of Laurent and Victoria coming to kill her?  Where was this strength of mind that she can't stop thinking of the hole in her chest?  There was no support or foreshadowing that it was even possible for a vampire to skip the newborn phase.  \\"'Some vampires have no adjustment period at all,' Edward said.\\"  That's all it would have taken.  Bella's 'ability' to master her newborn tendencies isn't a clever surprise, it just comes out of left field.    The vampire conversion process is the most painful experience anyone has ever experienced.  But when it's Bella's turn, she's able to lay on the table silently while the fire rages inside her.  This is even more blatant rule breaking because Bella has already experienced this once - at the end of Twilight - and she was definitely not laying quietly.  And in both cases she was injected with morphine.    The personalities of the characters changed in BD, without warning or development.  And we're not talking minor characters:    Bella - Bella goes from painfully shy and incredibly clumsy to super model vain and graceful.  She hates driving the Mercedes Guardian because it attracts attention, but later she's just fine with the Ferrari?  In Midnight Sun, Edward states that a vampire's human personality, likes and dislikes, get locked in at transformation.  He also explains that some human traits get transferred and magnified in transformation.  How then do we get this change in Bella?  Shouldn't she be even more shy and so klutzy she's unable to walk?    Edward - Edward loves Bella and has certain moral standards.  He values her moral standing so much that he insisted on marrying her before sex so he would not risk her soul in sin.  He's also bitter rivals with Jacob for Bella's affections.  Yet he offers her to Jacob to commit adultery if he could convince her to have an abortion?  He wouldn't have done this because it would have jeopardized Bella's soul.  And for Edward to call Jacob \\"my brother...my son\\"?  Absolutely out of character.    Charlie - Charlie is a police officer, so is suspicious by profession.  He's also a concerned and involved parent.  Witness him disconnecting Bella's battery cables when he even suspects she's going to sneak out.  Yet in BD he doesn't bat an eye at Bella's physical appearance, or the fact that she has a pre-adolescent child that looks like her.  He swallows it as part of the \\"don't ask don't tell\\" program.  That's not the Charlie from the previous books.    And oh my god, why did she have to turn Jacob into a pedo?  The author denies it of course.  In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, she says \\"It's not like that in the beginning.  It's like they'll be her brother or father figure.  Then later it will change.\\"    Well what do you call it, when the older of the pair knows that the relationship will one day be sexual, and they have a hand in the care and raising of that child?  At the least it's child-grooming.  How is that not just as sick and disgusting as outright pedophilia?  And lastly, Jacob gives Renesmee a PROMISE BRACELET.  If he truly had no future designs and only wanted her to be happy, he wouldn't have done that.    We're told that imprinting is supposed to ensure the best werewolf genes are passed on in order to create a stronger pack.  First off, how is that going to be done if not sexually?  Secondly, what WEREWOLF genes does Renesmee possess to pass on?  According to the author's rules, Jacob should not have imprinted on Renesmee.  As a plot device, there was so much wrong with this concept.  And for what purpose?  To negate conflict for Bella.  Better to have dropped Jacob from the story completely than turn him into a pedophile.  The device was fine as long as it was between older people of like age (Sam/Emily and Jared/Kim).  But when it expanded to include toddlers and babies she crossed the line.    Everybody loves a happy ending and I don't object to that.  It's how we got to the happy ending in this book.  In the end there was no cost, no struggle.  For three books, we hear all the things Bella would lose if she becomes a vampire:  her family, her friends, her soul, the ability to have children.  The tribe would have to kill the Cullens if they violate the treaty and bite her.  Jacob will become her enemy because she's one of the bloodsuckers.    In the first three books, Bella struggled and suffered.  That made it a worthwhile read.  What did Bella suffer in BD?  How does Bella overcome the problems in her way?  Does she grow, change or sacrifice in any way that enables her to gain her resolution?  Not at all.  Physically she's a vampire.  But she gets to keep her father, and she gets a baby that shouldn't exist.  Her new family is unharmed because the pedophile imprinting negates the treaty violation.  And the relationship with Jacob becomes platonic because he now has the hots for her baby.  Alice comes out of nowhere to negate the remaining conflict with the Volturi by saying \\"These aren't the droids you're looking for.\\"  At the most Bella had an anxiety attack because she thought the Volturi were going to kill them.  Ok, she did have some injuries during pregnancy, but that was easily fixed by vampire venom.    The easy arrival at the happy ending cheapens the story.  Conflict being resolved or negated without the protagonist doing anything for it is not interesting.  That's what I object to.  It's something you expect in fan fiction, not a published work.  I enjoyed the first three books, and that's why this book was such a disappointment.  Heck, Bella and Edward live happily ever after, who wouldn't want that ending?  It's just that in this case, it wasn't worth anything.    For me this all adds up to one great big epic failure.  I will say the first 80 or so pages wasn't quite as bad but then the begging for sex began.  Everything spiraled downward from there.  This book is not literature, just escapist reading.  But if the story is done so poorly that you can't escape into it or enjoy it, then the author has failed even at that.  I suppose if you could ignore all those flaws you might be able to enjoy this.  Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this book.  The story ends just fine after Eclipse, with Bella and Edward together and Jacob running off into the sunset.  That's good enough for a happily ever after.

B003ES61EE|5.0|I must admit it came in handy at the beach recently.  Blowing moist sand is an enemy of optics and in the past I'd use a damp t-shirt to wipe sand off of the lens of a $900 camera (why?).  I simply forgot I had this brush system and just before I used my wet, sunscreen tainted shirt, I was reminded of that Amazon doohickey by my wife.<br /><br />It was in my camera bag, and so pulled it out.  Brushed the sand off the lens and used that other tip end to get it out of the lens corners.<br /><br />Thumbs up!

0071120009|5.0|I love this book. I borrowed this book from my neuro professor because I was having so much trouble understanding our text. It is easier to understand than other neuro books because it is complete. It does not oversimplify concepts to the point of skipping over information the way that a lot of text books do. The language is only as complicated as it needs to be in order to be accurate.

B004EJUMT2|5.0|So probably you know by now if you are reading this. . .Ghost is made up of anonymous members who wear robes, with a singer dressed as a skeletal anti-Pope. They supposedly divine their songs from a \\"Ghoul writer\\", and all the lyrics are in praise of Satan.  Lest any of you get turned off by this (and I, as a Catholic, might have been), rest assured it's a joke, a shtick, a kind of Grand Guignol concept that was probably designed to garner this album much more attention than it would (sadly) have gotten otherwise. Well, it worked, and I'm glad it did, because this is fantastic songwriting. One listen to \\"Ritual\\", and you will be singing the soaring harmonies on the chorus, \\"smells of dead human sacrifices from the altar bed\\" as if it were \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\". Now that is an accomplishment, and Ghost deserve a lot of credit here. The production is big but not slick; strong, rich and full. The vocals are sung in a very \\"normal\\" classic rock harmony style and the music is a kind of hard rock/pop/prog mix. Blue Oyster Cult is an obvious reference point, but there is a bit of early Deep Purple too, and believe it or not, in a few turns of vocal phrase, XTC! Guitars are crunchy but not really overdriven and distorted. It is, essentially, an awesome classic-rock style set of well-written, played, and sung songs that deserve a wide hearing. How much you like the album probably depends on what you were expecting. If you listened to samples and liked it, you'll love it. If you thought it was black metal (and it is being probably dishonestly promoted as such by Rise Above), you might hate it.  So, as always, caveat emptor. . . listen to the samples (especially \\"Ritual\\", the best song not only on this record but the best I've heard in a long time).  For those wondering whether the Satanic stuff is for real or just a kind of play-acting concept, all doubts should be dispelled by reading this interview:[...]    UPDATE: Amazon deleted my link, but if you google \\"Live Evil\\"and \\"ghost opus eponymous\\" you can get to the interview, which is hilarious.    Another UPDATE: as some others on the web have pointed out, the singer and songwriter, at least, of this anonymous band is actually Tobias Forge, who records also as Mary Goore with Repugnant and with Magna Carta Cartel. This has been suspected by the tone of his voice, but I have proof: a sampler from Rise Above Records sent with Classic Rock Magazine has the song \\"Ritual\\" and lists the songwriter as (Forge).
B004HO6HYI|3.0|This is the entertainment business, and you know, they try, but probably the most entertaining thing about this movie was how it came to be. There are a lot of great films based on books, and even more great books deserving film adaptations, but rather than take a literary success and bring it to the big screen, Dreamworks decided to buy the rights to, of all things, I Am Number Four. Oh yeah, and they purchased them a year before it was even published! All because James Frey, author of A Million Little Pieces, decided to start a fiction franchise that pumps out books and movies that could be marketed to teens.<br /><br />But hey, why not? It was bound to be a success. A young man escapes a planet just as it's being destroyed, ending up in a quaint town in Kansas Ohio where he attempts to live a normal life, only to find that he possesses superpowers, which really throw a kink in his small-town romance. That exact story has already worked out once -- why not a second time? All you need to do is get the creators of Smallville to write the script, toss in some beautiful people and a few Michael Bay explosions, and you've got yourself a hit.<br /><br />I Am Number Four opens on a scene of said beautiful people partying at the beach. Our hero, John Smith (Alex Pettyfer), is having a blast with all his buddies, and even gets invited to a sexy swim with the school hottie, where she delivers such lovely dialogue as \\"The big dipper. It's my favorite.\\" I doubt she could even name another constellation, but that's neither here nor there, because suddenly a scar on John's leg emits a blinding light, signaling that Number Three is dead. For some reason that may or may not be explained in the book but certainly isn't in the movie, the survivors of planet Lorien can only be killed in order, so it's time for Number Four to go on the run. He and his protector, Henri (Timothy Olyphant, whose last name always reminds me of Lord of the Rings), burn all their belongings and hit the road, but an eeeeevil gecko sneaks onto their truck.<br /><br />Their flight leads them to Paradise, Ohio, where the gecko turns into a cute puppy...of DEATH! At least, that's what I kept expecting. But when the puppy passed up numerous opportunities to transform into a horrible monster and slay everyone, I ended up just being pretty confused about why they built up so much suspense.<br />Puppies aren't the only danger in Paradise, however. There's also Sarah (Dianna Agron), the school sweetheart. There's an alliterative joke in there somewhere. Something like \\"dogs are dangerous, but nothing can match the peril of the...\\" I don't know, some word for cat.<br /><br />Anyway, Sarah is an irresistible clich&eacute;, the blonde who dated the quarterback of the football team until she picked up photography, thus gaining a lens into the soul and learning the true meaning of love. At least the quarterback is original, except for the fact that he beats up science nerds and can't understand why Sarah doesn't want him and hates John for moving in on his territory. And the science nerd isn't just a science nerd. He happens to have a dad who was totally abducted by aliens so he's obsessed with rooting out all extraterrestrials at the school. All this is nothing at all like Smallville, because in that show, the blonde photographer is the same person who wants to root out the mystery behind the alien occurrences, and a different character is the love interest.<br /><br />I feel bad bashing this formula so much, because I have to admit, the characters really were hot, which is what really matters. Dianna Agron of Glee fame is a girl next door of no compare, and Alex Pettyfer is, undeniably, a beautiful piece of man. I mean, in his next movie, he literally plays a guy whose main character trait is that he's really really ridiculously good looking. Based on that alone, I figured I'd be able to enjoy their romance, but man, was I wrong. This was supposed to be a superhero movie, darn it, and we end up sitting through more than an hour of plodding romance with no action whatsoever. And it's not good romance either. It's just like Twilight: all meaningful looks, lip biting, and a thirst for blood.<br /><br />Maybe not the last one so much, but when this movie wasn't Smallville, it really was Twilight. The main guy has a secret that makes him an outsider at the school, but a beautiful girl is intrigued by his mystery and they fall for each other. And Loriens, unlike humans, only fall in love once and it lasts. Isn't it romantic? Blehck. Males everywhere will squirm in their seats. On the other hand, it's a perfect date movie. The guys will be excited to go, the girls will acquiesce, and then the girls will be so pleasantly surprised by the fact that the guy took them to a chick flick that they're sure to sleep with them. Except studies show that scary movies are much more likely to get you laid, so oh well.<br /><br />Although the whole first hour had me teetering on the edge of boredom, what's scary is how much I actually ended up liking the movie, because, you see, the last 20 minutes kick so much ass! The action sequence is the only place you feel like Michael Bay was attached to this, and it shows. Number Six (Teresa Palmer) arrives, and she's this hot, sarcastic Aussie girl with wavy blonde hair who can kill the evil Mogadorians like nobody's business and deliver one-liners right after. She slides on her knees, hamstringing baddies while Number Four deflects plasma gun blasts with his hands, shooting them back at his foes. Six can turn invisible and teleport and generate a fire shield and all this sick stuff. Which brings up the question, why is John's main superpower the ability to turn his hands into flashlights? I mean, like, I guess that would be sort of useful, but I'd way rather be able to turn invisible. The movie has to find all these excuses to have the battles take place in dark places so that John's power is useful, and it's amusing to see how often they work it in.<br /><br />Number Six was so cool that she saved the movie.The fact that she arrived at the end meant that I left feeling super stoked, which colored my whole experience with such a positive light that I couldn't help but enjoy myself. I don't know why she wasn't in the movie the entire time. Having someone fun and sarcastic was exactly what the plot needed to keep it from taking itself, and the romance, way too seriously.<br /><br />So, way too much slow, clumsy romance (and don't get me wrong. I love Titanic and The Notebook), and not nearly enough action, but the premise is good enough (even if it's stolen straight from Superman), and when the fighting actually starts, it's awesome (explosions, fireballs, plasma guns, giant winged monsters). If they made a sequel, I would definitely see it. Therefore, I give I Am Number Four:<br /><br />3/5 Stars<br /><br />Why did John decide to reveal himself to so many people in Paradise? The film made it look like he'd had a ton of close friends at his old school, but the second they found out about him, he fled. Within days of moving to Ohio, he was willing to confide in all sorts of people. Seems pretty fickle for a Lorien who's supposed to bond forever, but maybe that same fickleness will mean that Number Six is a love interest later. Who wouldn't pick Number Six over Sarah? Honestly.<br /><br />That about sums it up. Check out more on thenickelscreen on wordpressof plodding romance with no action whatsoever. And it's not good romance either. It's just like Twilight: all meaningful looks, lip biting, and a thirst for blood.    Maybe not the last one so much, but when this movie wasn't Smallville, it really was Twilight. The main guy has a secret that makes him an outsider at the school, but a beautiful girl is intrigued by his mystery and they fall for each other. And Loriens, unlike humans, only fall in love once and it lasts. Isn't it romantic? Blehck. Males everywhere will squirm in their seats. On the other hand, it's a perfect date movie. The guys will be excited to go, the girls will acquiesce, and then the girls will be so pleasantly surprised by the fact that the guy took them to a chick flick that they're sure to sleep with them. Except studies show that scary movies are much more likely to get you laid, so oh well.    Although the whole first hour had me teetering on the edge of boredom, what's scary is how much I actually ended up liking the movie, because, you see, the last 20 minutes kick so much ass! The action sequence is the only place you feel like Michael Bay was attached to this, and it shows. Number Six (Teresa Palmer) arrives, and she's this hot, sarcastic Aussie girl with wavy blonde hair who can kill the evil Mogadorians like nobody's business and deliver one-liners right after. She slides on her knees, hamstringing baddies while Number Four deflects plasma gun blasts with his hands, shooting them back at his foes. Six can turn invisible and teleport and generate a fire shield and all this sick stuff. Which brings up the question, why is John's main superpower the ability to turn his hands into flashlights? I mean, like, I guess that would be sort of useful, but I'd way rather be able to turn invisible. The movie has to find all these excuses to have the battles take place in dark places so that John's power is useful, and it's amusing to see how often they work it in.    Number Six was so cool that she saved the movie.The fact that she arrived at the end meant that I left feeling super stoked, which colored my whole experience with such a positive light that I couldn't help but enjoy myself. I don't know why she wasn't in the movie the entire time. Having someone fun and sarcastic was exactly what the plot needed to keep it from taking itself, and the romance, way too seriously.    So, way too much slow, clumsy romance (and don't get me wrong. I love Titanic and The Notebook), and not nearly enough action, but the premise is good enough (even if it's stolen straight from Superman), and when the fighting actually starts, it's awesome (explosions, fireballs, plasma guns, giant winged monsters). If they made a sequel, I would definitely see it. Therefore, I give I Am Number Four:    3/5 Stars    Why did John decide to reveal himself to so many people in Paradise? The film made it look like he'd had a ton of close friends at his old school, but the second they found out about him, he fled. Within days of moving to Ohio, he was willing to confide in all sorts of people. Seems pretty fickle for a Lorien who's supposed to bond forever, but maybe that same fickleness will mean that Number Six is a love interest later. Who wouldn't pick Number Six over Sarah?

B002BU0DPE|4.0|I received these as a Christmas Gift for use on my PS3. Easy to set up, comfortable, great sound and a steal for the money!
B003L20ICE|2.0|In this day and age when the media is trying to help the general public \\"get used to the idea\\" that gay people are \\"normal\\", why would this movie portray a main gay character as NOT gay? There were so many other ways to suggest a conflict in their lives besides her having an affair with a man.  She could have had an affair with another gay woman, maybe?  And then the man could have had some problem with taking over the family in another way like maybe smoking a doobie with the 21-year old or maybe or bring the kids too much into his own family life.  Something that could have been justified.  But having sex with the lesbian mother?  Eew, it doesn't make sense.  And did the sex scenes have to be so gross?  And so often?  Give me a break.  And the scene where the woman was under the covers was just ickey!  I don't want to see a movie have a scene like that with men OR women.  The juicy little kisses were enough.  The movie was watchable, otherwise, if only to see what was going to come up next.  Annette Bening was cool and bitchy and the kids were cute and realistic. The friend of the son was sort of weird and could have been strange in a different way instead of being portrayed as so ignorant and stupid.   I really liked Mark Ruffalo.  He played the part as best he could.  I didn't enjoy seeing Julianne Moore in those creepy shorts and socks and don't see how he could have been attracted to her.  In the end the guy is just left behind as a sick bastard with no redemption possible.  So many people think that gay women just don't like men, but I don't think that is true.  I am disappointed that Annette Bening would \\"go along\\" with the plot line.  She seems brighter than that.  She could have said, \\"Nyaaa\\"  \\"I don't wanna be in this movie\\"!
0061564893|5.0|This well written! It explains many things I had heard, but had not read anything about the Chinese people! It's very interesting and I would recommend it! Should be read by everyone who likes history!
B00009NHC5|5.0|I was a kid.....this movie was showing on TV......my parents said, \\"If you watch that, you'll have nightmares.\\" And were they right.     Wait Until Dark is a Hitchcockian-type thriller about three men looking for a doll. And Audrey Hepburn plays a blind woman who gets involved in the plot.    Probably the most unnerving part of the movie is the score provided by Henry Mancini (an out of tune piano with other instruments).     This movie is recommended for teenagers 15 years of age and older because the style is definitely Hitchcockian.
0131103628|5.0|This book is great as a reference.  It's not extremely detailed, but it gives you what you need.  I have C textbooks and I like this one the most, because I'd rather look through a couple hundred pages instead of a thousand.  If you don't have this, I recommend you get it even if you already have a book on C.
B002JCSRKC|4.0|They are not quite as tall as they appear in the photo, they come up to the mid-calf, and less bulky than you may think from the pic. They are pretty streamlined along the calves, not a whole lot of room to tuck in pants other than skinny jeans or tights. They don't look big or bulky on my feet, and they won't make your feet appear to be several sizes larger than they are (if that's something you're worried about).     Some people mentioned they fit large, and I am a 6.5 exactly, so I went with the 36 and found that my toes touch the end but I am still able to wear them comfortably. These boots will definitely give you blisters, so be ready for that, and if you would like to fit an insole into them, probably order the size up - there is nothing in them for arch support.    I think the stiffness mentioned in some other reviews will start to work itself out as they are worn, but I can see why you wouldn't want to drive a car the first time you put them on (the ankle region doesn't bend much). It'll definitely take some \\"wearing in\\" for them to get flexible.     The best part of these boots (I think) is how lightweight they are. The shipping was reasonable due to the weight (I ordered them to Canada).  I can actually wear them to work and bring a bag to carry them home because they don't weigh enough to be a burden.     Sidenote: Expect major suction/fart noises when you pull them off your feet after wearing them long enough to make your feet hot - embarassing when you first take them off with other people in the room ;) hahaha.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, if not my most favorite.  When I saw it in the theater many years ago, I did not what to expect.  I had not read the book and knew nothing of the story.  Had not even seen a preview.  I knew it was Sagan and science and space.  That is about all.  I had to drag my wife to see it.  I'm sure she would not have come . . . but for Matthew Mcconaughey.  Well, we both loved it.  The story is great - it is a plot you can really immerse yourself in.  Passion, religion, science, deception - its all here. And it makes you think about the big questions.  What is out there?  Are we alone?  Is the universe just an awful waste of space?  It is not just a science film, but about much more.    I have seen this film many many times now, and it never loses it luster.  That is the mark of a good film to me. One that you find laying on a Saturday afternoon, and you watch it  . . again and again., even though you know it by heart.    Go see this movie if you have not already. You will not be disappointed.
B00127RAJY|1.0|I have always been in great shape (I ran half marathons, swam 3-4/week, went to the gym regularly etc) never having any injuries. I decided to add this to my routine a few months before my wedding. BIG MISTAKE!!!! Right away I knew that some of the exercises weren't healthy for my knees as they were overextending (the side/front lunge for starters) I should have stopped after the first time but tried it once more thinking I should maybe slow it down. Turns out I tore both knee ligament. I showed the DVD to my physiotherapist who scolded me when I obviously knew better. I love Jillian but she runs through the moves WAY to fast (while holding weights) and it becomes just too dangerous. Plus everyone knows you shoudn't be working the same muscles every day - they need time to recover.
B004GGQMRY|1.0|What an embarrassment to MGM. I've never seen this before in over 200 Blu-ray discs: the video is simply upconverted standard def. This is appalling, really.    Unlike the spec table an other reviews, it is true 16x9 aspect ratio, and DTS sound, along with three commentary tracks.    This isn't Amazon's fault, of course. However, maybe our Amazon friends could convey to MGM what a disgrace this product is.
0385504225|1.0|Disappointing, The further along in the story I went, the more I started skipping ahead. I absolutely cannot believe the number of times whole scenes and conversations were repeated with only minor variations. The villain was so cartoonish he did everything except utter 'Muuuwaahhaha'. My response to the secrets the characters supposedly discovered were 'who cares' and 'you have got to be kidding me'. There wasn't much to like in this book.
B004MMEIK0|2.0|With such high ratings I was expecting something better written.  Not a 5-centuries-old vampire who says \\"Gods blood\\" every other page, yet still speaks in modern day vernacular the rest of the time.  Not a \\"mortal\\" who blithely proceeds to fall for this hunky immortal vampire, decides that she wouldn't want to become a vampire herself, then never thinks about it again--even though we all know she will continue to age and will eventually die while her lover lives on.  The product names for the synthetic blood drinks verge on the ridiculous--\\"bubbly blood\\"?  \\"Blood lite\\"?  Maybe others find such things humorous, I just found them unbelievable.  Two stars because it was sufficiently readable for me to bother finishing it after I had started, but I did delete it off my Kindle afterward--I have no interest whatsoever in rereading it in the future, and it was a close call whether I would finish it or give up partway through.    Also, there is a slight undercurrent of \\"faith\\" in this novel.  I prefer my romances steamy and religion-free, so this was another drawback as far as I was concerned.  However, to each her own.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|If you haven't seen The Social Network, I'm not sure where you've been. Jesse Eisenberg's portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg is so convincing that you'll be googling immediately after viewing to see if scenario A or B or C were real. I watched it twice when I rented it for a 24 hour period here on Amazon On Demand and then purchased it when the price dropped to $11.99. The packaging on this Collector's Edition is like nothing I have ever seen before and alone makes this a great purchase. \\"Get it while it's hot\\" and before the Collector's Edition is no longer available.
0307594009|5.0|Throughout the years, attempts have been made to discredit this book as a work of total fiction.  It's easy to understand why: It's difficult to imagine that a young teen could write with such maturity, insight, and literary skills, especially vocabulary.  However, each of the challenges to the authenticity of this book have been turned back.  Numerous analytical studies of the paper, ink, handwriting, etc. have proven that his is indeed a remarkable book written by Anne at the age of 13 and 14.  She received the blank journal on her thirteenth birthday, June 12, 1942.  She and her family went into hiding on July 9 in an Amsterdam warehouse to flee Nazi occupation.  Her last entry was August 1, 1994.  Three days later she and the other seven people hiding in the facility were captured and sent to concentration camps, where eventually Anne died of typhus.  I don't believe I am spoiling anything here with this description; I assume everyone knows Anne's story.  But, it is worthwhile to read the diary anyway to get a renewed sensation of the toll the Nazis caused the world in their genocide program.  Here is one brilliant girl and her seven compatriots.  How many other Anne Franks were destroyed?  The book is a compelling commentary on Anne's situation: her description of the people she lived with and the conditions they suffered through, their experiences during the frightening air raids, the help they received from non-Jewish friends, her first real taste of love, and the thoughts of an otherwise normal teen.  If she were alive today, Anne Frank would be 80 years old.  It is mind blowing to think what this girl might have accomplished in her life if she had survived.
B004I2K4DY|4.0|The important thing to note is that every cast will differ a little.  Every broadway/east end fan knows this.  That said, many of us who love the Dream Cast from the 10th Anniversary DVD have probably seen the same DVD countless times in the past 15 years.    So this entirely new cast with their own interpretation will take getting used to. Many of them are good such as Norm Lewis as Javire, Samantha Barks as Eponine, they are 2 of the shining standouts from this cast. Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean is good too but will take getting used to. Quite a different Jean Valjean than I'm used to.    Everyone else is good or passable with 1 exception. Nick Jonas as Marius is TERRIBLE!!!  (Hence the 4 stars instead of 5 stars).  He is one of the better looking Marius' I've seen BUT he has only one expression throughout the entire show.  Be it sorrow of happiness or anger he has that one constipated look on his face.  His voice is very weak, this is very very obvious when you hear the other men at the barricades.  Also the trio melody of Marius, Eponine, Cosette again its painfully obvious that there is absolutely no strength behind his voice.  The solo \\"Empty Chairs and Empty tables\\" is usually very moving, but not when Nick Jonas sings it.      Despite that singular casting mistake, this is still worth the buy especially if you love Les Miserables.  It shows you a slightly different interpretation of the songs/show which theater goers love.  Its worth the buy.  Also, judge for yourself if Nick really is as bad as I say.  (I'm pretty sure most will agree with my opinion).
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I loved Adele since her first album \\"19\\" came out. Her vocal prowess is just beyond any of today's current artists. This album just makes me even love her more.    \\"Rolling in the Deep\\", \\"Rumour Has It\\" and \\"Someone Like You\\" are definitely standouts.
B0009UC810|4.0|Let me start off by saying this is a 5 star movie. John Belushi and Dan Ackroyd are hilerious in this. I knocked off 1 star because the dvd itself is a flipper disc which means it can get scratched very easily. I also wished there were commentaries and maybe some of the SNL performances. But other than that this is a really good dvd and the extras are pretty good. you get the extended version and theatrical cut of the film which is nice. It comes with the trailer and some documentaries which are pretty cool. Overall Pretty good DVD I recommend it and its at a great price too.
0060558121|3.0|I love this book. I read it twice (from the library) before I broke down and bough the book.<br /><br />The paperback edition uses poor quality paper. I paid extra for the paperback (vs. mass market paperback) expecting the kind of quality that I've seen with other trade paperbacks. I'm very disappointed! Text from the reverse of a page is clearly visible and you can even see text from the next page.<br /><br />It isn't the publisher's fault (I assume) but the cover is noticeably damaged (rough edges).<br /><br />This text refers to the following edition of the book:<br />[[ASIN:0060558121 American Gods: A Novel]]
B002N5N5M0|1.0|Don't watch this - Dexter series 4 is a total waste of time and will leave you infuriated and unsatisfied! The ending is really bad, but it never actually gets any good. I loved the first 2 series but wow they went completely off the tracks here and series 3 isn't much better. Be warned!!!
0439023483|2.0|A quick and easy read, but so what?  The premise of this book--child v. child in a death match--is disgusting.  Yes, William Golding pulled it off brilliantly in Lord of the Flies.  But Collins is no Golding.  The writing is very poor, very mechanical.  It's like she wrote it in Excel.  Ugh.

0060936223|4.0|At the beginning of this book, Smith writes a prologue about hearing that Mapplethorpe had passed.  Reading it, I thought she was overwrought.  That is, it was as if she were telling herself, this is what happened and how I felt, as if she were trying to establish a view of herself as an artist, a poet, rather than to express herself honestly.  Then, early on, describing her childhood, she tells about a time she sat down next to a creek, and she describes the company of pollywogs in the rushing water.  Thinks me to m'self: pollywogs don't like moving water, they want still ponds and puddles.  This never happened!  Smith is imagining a moment in her childhood and exagerating it in order to paint a picture of herself as the born artist, as always committed to art.           Despite these misgivings, I read onward!  And guess what? The next thing you know I am totally engrossed in this depiction of a young man and a young woman who were, in fact, completely dedicated to the life of art, and to each other.  I don't know, probably Smith IS exagerating, but I didn't care any more.  Memory does that- it smoothes down rough edges, it tells you what you want to hear.  Doesn't matter, the generosity, love and commitment of these two people to one another was true, I know it, I can feel it clearly.  It seeps through in Smith's words. And, gilded though her memory may be, the facts of the way that Smith lived her life as a young woman shows a commitment to art.  The proof is in the pudding, actions speak louder than words and all that.           I'm not overly familiar with the work of either artist, and what I know of Mapplethorpe does not appeal to my aesthetic. I still admire the artists.        PS  Just previously to picking up Just Kids, I read Julia Child's memoir  (My Life In France).  Great pairing- underneath it all, they are (were) both artists completely dedicated to their call, but yet the tone of the two varies widely. Smith gave me a sense of the total commitmentto art, of being swept up in art.  Child has her feet firmly planted on the ground, and is concerned far more with the mechanics of creation.  Read them both, I tell ya!
B001UJL9OQ|5.0|Great album with some of pacs best songs included. 2 full cds make it well worth the money. It is raw 2pac with less focus on the beats but with real true lyrics. This album like any other tupac album, is above all other rappers. This isn't an album to give one quick listen to and judge you have to really give pacs verse the listen they diserve and youll fall in love.
B002ZG980U|4.0|I love the movie and though I am very disappointed in the absence of a commentary track, the extras included are nice (if nothing special).
B0043EV774|5.0|At 63, I can remember seeing the original Alice in Wonderland and really didn't like it.  It was a little too far out there for me. So, I was skeptical about the new version.  I first viewed it in regular BluRay and loved it.  Although I'm not a real big fan of Johnny Depp, I thought he did a marvelous job in this movie and I absolutely loved Helena Carter as the Red Queen.  I normally don't like the \\"bad guy,\\" but she was a very likeable villain.  In fact, I loved all the characters.  What a great movie.  I'm really surprised it only received a 6 out of 10 rating.  When compared to the original version, it should have received a solid 10.  Guess it's all a matter of personal preference.  Very few \\"remakes\\" are better than the original and I thought this movie hit the bullseye.  AND...the 3D version simply blows your socks off.  I've watched it several times and enjoy it even more each time.
1416550550|4.0|I'll admit, it took me a bit of work to get into this novel, which in of itself is a bit shocking. Considering it starts basically with a four year old girl being abandoned on a boat from England to Australia. I wonder if the problem was more with me being distracted and busy than a problem with the Author or the book itself. Once I able to sit down for awhile and thoroughly enjoy Kate Morton's descriptive prose, I was swept up into the mystery of the young girl ,Nell.<br /><br />The reader is given bare snippets of this unraveling mystery as we are thrust back and forth between 2005, 1976,and the early 1900's. Tantalizingly slow, we are given nuggets of information as we feel the heartache, romance, and loss of this beautifully written novel. Very enjoyable.
B004EQAVHI|5.0|Great movie, although not a happy, perfect ending type, which adds to the drama.  Perfect casting with Mulligan, Knightly, and Garfield.  Makes you pause and take a step back to think \\"could this really ever happen\\".  Have watched this 3 times and see something different everytime.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I was looking for the perfect workout video, not too wimpy not too hard.  This is it.  I have worked out for over 20 years, doing push ups, sit ups, the treadmill...but I was ready to bump it up a notch.  Jillian knows what you need and encourages you just when you think you can't take one more jumping jack! The first day I was so sore I could not move my arm but the next day it was easier and it just keeps getting better.  This will sculpt your body and will give you the abs you have always wanted.  After two weeks I can see a big difference.

0441013597|4.0|\\"He who controls the spice controls the universe\\"<br /><br />Duke Leto Atreides along with his concubine, Jessica, and son, Paul, is leaving his homeworld of Caladan to rule over the profitable and highly desired world of Arakkis.  But Baron Vladimir Harkonnen hates House Atreides and doesn't like how his House has been pushed out, so he plans a coup.  Meanwhile, Paul begins to learn of his destiny and special purpose.<br /><br />This book is a science fiction classic, and I've been recommended it many, many times.  Finally, I broke down and borrowed the audiobook to get a glimpse at this great work.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed when reading Dune was how detailed it was.  Herbert really thought about how life would be on a desert world, and I was impressed and intrigued at his effort.  I even believed it was possible to have such a desert world.  In some ways, Arakkis is more real to me than even Tatooine (and I am a HUGE Star Wars fan!).  The way the Fremen acted, the thought that sand is like water, the care for preserving moisture...all of these helped make Arrakis real and believable.<br /><br />Secondly, Herbert doesn't cheapen his characters just to show off his stuff in the planetology or politics department.  My favorite character was Jessica.  Herbert didn't make Jessica some stupid sexy woman who is only in the story to boink the main character.  I felt Jessica was well written, smart, and active.  Plus, I really was impressed how Herbert made her proficient in the use of the Wielding Way, a psuedo-martial arts.  Other notable characters are Duke Leto, Stilgar and Count Fenring.<br /><br />But something else became obvious.  The first section is slow and confusing.  I wanted to give up so often, but didn't because of others cheering me on.  After I got past the first part, however, the writing was somehow easier and more interesting.  I was particularly interested in the big coup between the Harkonnens and the Atreides.  But, around the time the story skips forward in time, I found myself drifting away.  And the ending confused me and slightly bored me.  So this uneven pacing and uneven interest does somewhat taint my impression of Dune...<br /><br />Now, before I get splattered with tomatoes, I do have a reason why this might be that doesn't include \\"It's the author's fault\\".  I listened to this on audiobook (albeit unabridged, so I can't blame it on the audiobook being abridged), so it's possible that I missed something while listening, perhaps while finding my place, resuming in the middle of a section or just toning out and not paying 100% attention.  So I would like to one day read this in book format so that I can fill the gaps and see if the novel drifts off the same way I experienced on audiobook.<br /><br />I also never really liked Paul.  So many call him \\"older than his years\\", but I almost found him to be an impertinent, know-it-all twerp.  Was it the audiobook again and my attention to it that is to blame or my perception of the book in general?<br /><br />I don't like reading about four year olds that act much older than their age, so when I read about Alia, I cringed.  I will admit, that Herbert had probably the best explanation for her worldly wisdom, but I still hate children like that and had to fight myself against hating Alia outright.<br /><br />Although this book has a tough beginning to go through, it really does get more interesting.  I also can't help but be awed at how well Herbert thought out Arakkis and the great characters Herbert filled his world with.  The latter tends to be nearly unheard of in science fiction, hence the \\"Space Babe\\" and \\"Super Hero\\" male protagonist stereotypes that are flung around.  I won't lie, I didn't like how slow it was, how much talking about everything that occurred, and how odd the ending is.  And I wouldn't recommend anyone listen to this on audiobook as I did.  I think I missed out on a lot of things (such as the appendices, which appear only at the end of the audiobook, and the glossary, which would have saved me many trips to Wikipedia).  But I think anyone who likes science fiction should give this a try, if only to see a classic scifi novel.  I can truly see why this is to scifi as Lord of the Rings is to fantasy.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S. Light*trips to Wikipedia).

0670022411|5.0|OMg!  I saw the review for this book in People magazine and knew I had to read this book.  Oh dear, I am so immersed in this book that I do not want it to end.  I have fallen in love with the love story.    There's so much more than just a love story in this book though and you will love and savor every word.  It's beautifully written.  This will be the first book that I will read twice.  I can hardly wait for the next book (it's the first book in a trilogy).  I keep imagining who my vampire hero would be in a movie and I can't help but think of Johnny Depp.    Does anyone else see someone else?  Recommend this book to everyone you know.  They will love it.
B000R4SMCW|4.0|I am completely happy with the price along with the condition of this like new DVD. Just one thing, if there is anyway not to place the price sticker in a way that it cannot be removed without damaging the DVD cover.     Thank you
B003RNXIBK|1.0|More unfiltered trash straight from your mainstream to allow the populus to get dumber and dumber while the real music, the music that makes you think and question authority will never be heard because you have accepted what has been coming out of hollywood for what is actually deamed \\"good\\". Wrong, theres opinion and fact, and the fact is:    There is better music and better music for you. Don't waste your money, time, or ego being pursuaded otherwise.

This album is a MUST HAVE for anyone, it is truly beautiful and calming. The vocal songs by Chloe, Leslie Mills and Nathan Pacheco are wonderful. Truth of Touch and Nine are my favorites.
1594202842|5.0|Well, as an Indian living in the US, i completely understand why some people are squirming reading the way Amy brought up her kids! I agree, but you should also understand there are two points here - One, this is more of a comparison of how 'Chinese mothers' bring up their kids when compared to 'western mothers.' And secondly, by Chinese, as Amy mentioned she meant anyone who is tough on their kids and by western she meant that anyone who was... well easy on their kids. The book is not about what is right, rather it is about how things are done in a different culture and coming from a similar culture I found this one irresistibly attractive!!!    Now, coming to the book itself, it is quite accurate in describing the childhood of a cub! I remember dreading going home with anything less than a 100 on the paper. I have always been reminded of how \\"irresponsible\\" a kid I am. Never allowed to spend more than 30 mins a day on the computer and that too only for programming, never watch TV while eating, always eat with your mouth close or leave the table and \\"no food for you tonight\\" is quite a common phrase in our household (although my dad used to see that this never happened and all done without my mom's knowledge!!!) And before you think that he is a saint and my mom a dictator you should realize that every day after coming from school at 3:30PM, I used to watch the TV till 4:00 and shut it off as soon as I heard his car in the garage!!! This was not as bad as you would imagine it to be. In fact, today some of my 'Western' friends are surprised at how close I am with my mom! This just reminded me that I can perform better and failures have no excuses.    If you disagree, let me point it out to you that failures at school might be ok back home, but the society views  it exactly as a tiger mom would and irrespective of how much you philosophize about it, the fact is you got to live in this society and you better live by its rules and definitions. In essence my parents taught me that failures meant that you need to give it a little more push, so I am quite unaware of the feeling - \\"depression!\\" And they also taught me that when someone tells you that you are a failure, you should have enough strength to prove them wrong. I am pretty sure that there are no surveys which can give you an idea of which parenting is better, but let me tell you from personal experience that those were the best days of my life. Today my mom and I talk about those golden days, not only the days when she had to trash me black and blue but also the days when my brother rebelled and got his share. In the end, no one is complaining. We loved the childhood that we had, irrespective of what you say because we earned our trips to the water park, we earned our first bicycle, we earned every chocolate that we ate and in return our parents earned every bit of respect that we have for them through the endless nights they spent without a wink on their eye carefully chiseling out tomorrows at the expense of their today's.

0553805371|3.0|Three hundred ninety four Amazon reviews (as of this moment) are evidence that this book is a pretty good brain tickler.       Many reviewers are shocked that Hawking says \\"Philosophy is dead.\\"  These reviewers can relax.  Philosophy is not dead.  It has been said that every man is a philosopher.  But \\"Philosophy Rises from the Grave,\\" \\"Night of the Living Philosophers,\\"  \\"Philosophy III-The Final Chapter,\\" and \\"Philosophy IV-The New Beginning\\" might have some market potential.     \\"The Grand Design\\" explains that the uncertainty principle does not allow the vacuum to be empty; quantum events occur in the emptiest space.  The book suggests that the beginning of the universe can be considered as a quantum event.  The authors briefly discuss the sum-over-histories approach to quantum mechanics and the M-theory attempt to get something useful out of string theory (\\"M\\" for \\"Maybe this will work\\").  Basing their thinking on these ideas,  Hawking and Mlodinow infer the spontaneous emergence of a very large number of universes from absolute nonexistence.  Physical laws and physical constants differ in the different universes.  Some physical laws do not produce stable universes and these universes collapse or dissipate.  Other universes persist but their physical laws do not permit life as we know it.  It is only in a universe where the physical laws and physical constants happen to be within very narrow constraints that people can appear, become NASCAR fans and/or read books like this, and see that, wow!  the whole universe is designed within close tolerances to suit us exactly!  It must have been created by a super-powerful video game designer way up there in the sky!  There is simply no other rational explanation!  But we learn that any such reasoning is unfounded.  Because of all the universes, you see     (I wonder if there are universes where no one has to make any hypotheses, since, due to variant physical laws, all things are obvious).     Some parts seem to be missing from Hawking and Mlodinow's argument .  Quantum events require space in which to occur, and prior to the universe there was no space.  How could the primal event occur?  Perhaps this question is dealt with in first-level cosmology courses.  It would have been helpful if Hawking and Mlodinow had addressed it directly in their book.     Considered as just two guys kicking around some ideas,  The Grand Design is pretty good.  On the whole, Hawking and Mlodinow's philosophizing can probably hold its own with any cave or utopia envisioned by Plato, or anything likely to be produced by a group of college students who have a couple cases of beer and Red Bull, a few ounces of quality weed and an awake-until-dawn Friday night to spend considering the mystery of existence.     It's interesting to find that Hawking has given up on the pursuit of a unified theory and views an M-theory patchwork as being all we can say about all that is.  Maybe he is right.  On the other hand, even intrepid explorers of the universe get tired sooner or later.  There may be some college students who are ready to step up.     Explanations in the book are skillfully done but condensed to the point of being telegraphic.  I don't know if this is Mlodinow's natural style or if the publisher told Hawking \\"Each additional page will reduce sales of the book by half.\\"  The illustrations are handsome and eye-catching.

B002LFPAUC|5.0|John Cleese can make just about anyone laugh.  This series of shows is totally hilarious.   It is hard to decide which one is a most favorite because each episode has its own sort of theme and the cast seems perfect for the roles.  Too bad there aren't more of these shows.   Very worthwhile to get.
B002RKRTGO|1.0|For some reason there are passages of the text missing, the first of which is the legend of the hound. I don't know if it's just a technical glitch because I'm using the Kindle software on my Mac or there is something else going on. Doesn't seem to be much point in having a book with parts of the story missing.
B0042X9L6A|4.0|I upgraded to a pair of these from a pair of SB600's (which I still use) and I'm quite impressed. I love the improvements in the menu system, the settings are all pretty easy to access and change and the analog switches for the flash mode and output direction are really nice to have.  The power isn't such an issue for me because I'm used to the SB600 which isn't a terribly powerful flash and I'm rarely ever firing at 1/2 to full power as it is. The TTL system is much improved and seems to be way more consistent with exposure than the SB600's and having the distance indicator when in manual is a welcome addition as well.  The 360* head swivel is great as well as the downward tilt when using on-camera.  The only gripe I really have is the lack of a PC sync on the flash, but I will take the added optical slave in exchange.  No, it's not an SB900 or an SB800 but it sure is a huge improvement over the model it's replacing and it's priced pretty fair considering the added features.
B000FC2PKG|3.0|I liked this book, especially after I read her afterword. I think it is neat that she named many characters after real-life friends and family.<br /><br />Her plot was enjoyable with a variety of twists and turns. Some of these were more believable than others. The characters were well-developed, and I liked the way she drew out their background in small chunks here and there in believable ways. There were no long periods of introspection that seemed contrived or long chunks of \\"info dump\\" that can be either boring or distracting - or both.<br /><br />All in all, I really enjoyed this and I will likely read her follow up books on D.D. Warren in the future.
B000NY12LO|5.0|This was my first Jodi Picoult book and I absolutely loved it.  I had a very hard time putting it down.  You just want to read \\"one more page\\" to see what will happen next.

0525951652|5.0|As I was reading this novel, I was watching the riots in Egypt.  I felt like the TV news was part of the novel.  Since World War I how much has changed in the attitudes of those in power?  None.  I am 76 years old, and knew almost nothing about how World War I began.  The historical research in this novel was compelling reading.

B002ZG976U|3.0|This multi-million dollar extravaganza is primarily a vehicle for former Mouseketeer Christina Aguilera which some support from Cher - and a GREAT turn by actor Stanley Tucci. Its aimed at the \\"under 30 set\\" to whom \\"Burlesque\\" represents, not the old American theatrical art form that combined striptease with bawdy comedy routines. This is \\"burlesque\\" for the new (well, its not so new) millennium.<br />Written and directed by Steven Antin (not a veteran of movie musicals), the film can't decide if it wants to tell a real story or show highly-edited fast moving song and dance numbers, nearly all with Ms. A. Obviously Antin has seen Chicago as he films some of the staged numbers in a style similar to Director Rob Marshall. The plot - as scripted by Antin - is not much different from the disaster that was called \\"Showgirls\\". Showgirls had lots of nudity. Basically none here. The \\"partial nudity\\" mentioned in the MPAA rating at the beginning is a shot of bare MALE buttocks.<br /><br />I mention Cabaret above for two reasons: Alan Cumming appeared in Cabaret as well as in this film and he has one number \\"Jungle Berlin\\" which is in the style of the musical numbers in Cabaret. It's a great number - though highly edited in the film - and one of the few scenes Cumming gets to appear in here. Like most of the production numbers, this one is chopped up with the Director cutting away to other scenes. The only song I remember seeing performed straight through is Cher's solo on \\"The Last of Me\\", a number which is for Cher what \\"My Way\\" was for Sinatra. Luckily the \\"Jungle Berlin\\" number - though less than two minutes long - is presented complete as one of the six \\"entire song performances\\" in the bonus features. The other five are a mixed bag. First is a \\"dancers only\\" version of a one number with a repeating vocal-backed soundtrack that really gets boring after 30 seconds. Then there is a version of Sinatra's hit \\"That's Life\\" performed by Cumming, in full Gene Kelly mode, that was deleted from the film. The others include - thankfully - the unedited version of the erotic \\"Dr. Longjohn\\". The other bonuses include a Director's commentary track, a five-minute \\"blooper reel\\", and a six-minute \\"alternate opening\\" which basically rearranges the opening song.<br /><br />As I noted earlier - this is the modern version of burlesque, which means sexy dancing by gorgeous women - who never take their costumes off on stage. Well, there is one \\"fan dance\\" by Aguilera  - exactly one hour into the film -but that's it. This is not a strip show.<br /><br />As a film directed to Ms. A fans - and Cher fans curious to see her again and sing that one big solo number - the film succeeds as a group of music videos. The script is banal but - thankfully - there is more singing than dialogue. Its entertaining to watch once. But you won't learn anything about \\"burlesque\\" by watching it.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"ed from the film.

B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I could not put this book down!  This is my 2nd Jodi Picoult book and I can't wait to read more!  This one is my favorite by far - once again Picoult has a way of pulling you into the story so you feel as if you are there with them.  The characters in this particluar book warmed my heart and the strength of their relationship was mesmerizing.  With an unexpected turn of events at the end, this one is a must read!
1597801585|5.0|This book blew me away and lingers in my memory. Paolo Bacigalupi's writing is so strong, it haunts you and leaves you feeling awed while still providing a viscerally real experience.    In the ecologically devastated future, a few massive corporations are fighting a political ground war against nationalists in Thailand to get access to their seed bank. Things get ugly and dangerous very fast, and the novel explores every character fully while still moving at a breakneck speed.    The Thailand of the future the author paints in this stunner of a book is so real and plausible you'll feel like you've taken a privileged glimpse of the future, one filled with sweat and blood and the presence of a hollow world where humanity persists on a blind path. The book is gritty, dirty, violent, and grounded in realism. The characters are all human beings the reader can relate to, and even those who aren't quite human still manage to connect.    This book affected me in the same way Dhalgren did (Sam Delaney) but it does so with a marksman's precision and the speed of a fired bullet. I highly recommend this book, it defies genre and category, and Bacigalupi is a writer worthy of all the attention and accolades The Windup Girl has garnered.
1597801585|2.0|I slogged through this book.  The ideas are fantastic, the plot is excellent.  The writing is absolutely awful.  I can't remember ever being so bored while at the same time being presented with truly intriguing possibilities, concepts and scenes. There is too much character development of the minor characters and not enough of the primary characters.  There is a scene which is reminiscent of apocalypse now which becomes so dull that it becomes a let down, instead of pivotal to the plot.  I am wholly unwilling to sing praises here - I would suggest that Paolo stick to the plot and work with a writer who can spin a scene and a character so that you can feel them.  That's what missing; that's what would make this book worthy of the praise.
B003EYVY0E|4.0|I've been putting off buying Year 3 for months due to the poor reviews about the lack of an extended edition.  I love bonus material more than anyone, but I couldn't put it off any longer in the hopes of a new \\"ultimate and we really mean it this time\\" edition (not that I'll be surprised if the studio tries to triple dip.  I've learned never to underestimate corporate greed).<br /><br />I've never seen the ABC Family extended version, but unless it includes more than the four deleted scenes on this disc, totalling all of 5 minutes (or less), I sort of understand the decision not to re-edit the entire movie just to incorporate this little bit.  The scenes are nice for die-hard fans, but not remotely essential and easy to see why they were cut.  Still, for the lack of an extended version I subtracted a star.<br /><br />What does irk me is disc 2, which so far seems to be only more tiresome games for the kiddies with no real bonus content.  Don't know for sure, I gave up after two games.  I don't know which would be more annoying, having to fight through the pointlessness to get to actual material or fighting through it with nothing to show for it at the end.  So I skipped to disc 3. (EDIT: Found them, in the \\"Hogwarts Grounds\\" and \\"Divination Class\\" sections.  Thankfully don't have to play games to get them (I still haven't forgiven WB for the hoops I had to jump through to get to one deleted Snape scene on the Sorcerer's Stone first release).  Here there's a tour of the creature shop and a very entertaining 45 minutes of cast and crew interviews.  Except no sign of Alan Rickman.  Am I the only one who remembers he's in the movie?)<br /><br />Disk 3 has some really in-depth material.  Halfway through the featurette on creatures I placed my order for Year 4, because it's been so long since I've seen any new HP material (well, since DH Pt 1 in November) and it really is (almost) worth the purchase price.  This disc also includes a \\"trailer\\" for the Film Wizardry book that I've had on my wish list since Christmas, that makes me give it more serious consideration.<br /><br />So far there's precious little Snape content (which is what I REALLY care about in the franchise), but my hopes are still high for the final movie to take care of that.<br /><br />My new concern is a website I came across speculating that WB will abandon the ultimate editions for the second half of the series and go back to a more \\"conventional\\" special edition.

0802714544|5.0|I devoured this book in three days. There's almost no action--not what you'd expect for a spy story--and heaps of complex dialogue, and I couldn't put it down....    I sought out [[ASIN:0802714544 The Spy Who Came in From the Cold]] because it was recommended in [[ASIN:1570616507 Book Lust to Go: Recommended Reading for Travelers, Vagabonds, and Dreamers]] as a good book to read for Germany (current interest), as parts are set in Berlin during the Cold War. Then I saw that the master storyteller Graham Greene had blurbed it as \\"the best spy story I have ever read\\" so then I knew I had to read it. And it really is excellent. Just don't expect it to be any sort of James Bond thriller; this is the polar opposite.    Alec Leamas is a life-long secret agent for England working in West Berlin against the Soviets (mostly in East Berlin). He's quite experienced though not very brilliant, seen a lot of agents on both sides rise and fall with rather bad luck for his men recently, and then is called to London for a little chat with his superior about his future. That's not much of an intro, but I won't spoil the story by revealing further any of the subsequent plot (and plot twists). Beginning and ending with the Berlin Wall, the book transcends the spy novel genre and the Cold War setting to become an exploration of the power and futility of individuals within and against ideologies and organizations (as contradictory as that sounds). Sure, it's cynical and gray and depressing, but that doesn't mean you won't be glad you read it.    I'm headed to the library to get the movie version now...

The only issue I have with the item is I hate paper cardboard cases to hold my cd's. They can get scratched up easily and they do not go well in my collection since you cannot read the side of the case like you can when its in a proper plastic cd case. It is a shame that companies are getting so cheap these days that they won't shell out the dough for a decent plastic case that is the standard. Besides the substandard crappy cardboad case that comes with with the product, the cd is exceptional quality. I give the cd 5 stars and the case 1 star.

0061122416|3.0|I recently read this book while laying on the beach under the Caribbean sun. And while it's an entertaining afternoon read with a catchy start, I really felt that it went towards the deep end when the main character starts to have a lengthy conversation with the sun and the wind. Felt more like a hallucination. The author manages to pull it back together with a much anticipated happy-ending.<br /><br />Overall, is full of heart-warming clich&eacute;s such as \\"everything happens for a reason\\", \\"everybody has a noble purpose in life\\", \\"follow your dreams\\" etc, etc. So, if you are trying to feel  better about yourself, it might help.

B004ODLUF8|5.0|I've been an astronomy buff ever since I was a small child. So, when I learned that the Denver Museum of Nature and Science was showing a new IMAX movie about the Hubble Space Telescope, I had to see it. The theater hadn't yet upgraded to a 3D projection system, so the version I saw was in 2D. Believe me, that was plenty good enough.    It is said that Hubble is the most famous telescope ever built, and there are about 20 years' worth of fabulous cosmic images to prove it. When NASA initially announced that it was too dangerous for the Space Shuttle to make one last Hubble servicing mission to do needed repairs and upgrades, a lot of us went into mourning. And when they changed their minds, we rejoiced.    The movie is partly about the 2009 servicing mission, along with archival footage from earlier missions. This part is interesting, but not particularly new to me -- the PBS science program Nova has done at least one hour-long segment which goes into much greater detail. We get to meet the seven very brave astronauts who were literally willing to risk their lives to get the job done. Space is a dangerous place, and a single careless slip of the hands can lead to a sliced glove and a fatal loss of suit pressure.    Also, two space shuttles have been lost over the years, along with 14 astronauts, so they had a backup shuttle on the pad just in case a rescue mission was needed. Thankfully, it wasn't.    We learn a few fun things about life in orbit, such as how to make a chicken burrito in microgravity, and how to get ready for a space walk. I discovered that, even though space is silent, the sounds of power tools can be transmitted through a space suit, to be picked up by the helmet microphone.    Where the movie really shines, however, is when they show footage of the Earth from orbit, and especially when they begin to explore the cosmos. Decades of effects-laden blockbuster films have tended to jade us, but what we see in Hubble IMAX is real, as seen from the Hubble Space Telescope itself.    I about lost it when the camera began to zoom in on Orion's Belt, and slowly the Orion Nebula swam into view. It was as if we were spanning lightyears, at warp speed, in mere seconds. Then the camera began to explore an enormous cosmic valley with walls of gas and dust, some 15 lightyears across, hollowed out by fierce interstellar winds and dotted with infant solar systems dubbed \\"tadpoles\\" by scientists. One particular system looked like a tiny golden gem swathed in a huge, black nest, and might well resemble our own solar system aeons ago when the planets were just beginning to form.    What struck me more than anything else was how uniquely privileged our generation is, of all the generations in human history. The ancients could gaze up in awe at the stars from their campfires and make up poems and stories, but only we, thanks to telescopes like Hubble, can see such stunningly beautiful images of planets, stars, nebulae, galaxies, even the entire visible universe looking like a piece of gauze, the strands sprinkled liberally with gem dust.    I was struck also by the fact that there was hardly a peep from any of the children in the audience. They were all paying rapt attention.    I've never before seen any IMAX movie more than once. So far, I've seen Hubble three times. My most recent trip was to a 3D showing at a local cineplex. That was a plus. Now, as the camera zoomed, the stars actually came out of the screen at me. The 2009 shuttle footage, presumably shot in 3D, was incredibly real -- I was tempted to reach out and try to touch the astronauts' equipment as they got ready for a space walk. Archival footage, most likely converted to 3D, had a peculiar, subtle flatness to it I've dubbed 2-1/2D. It just didn't look quite right. I'm sure the producers did their very best, but the technology is still evolving.    A note on the music: The film featured two familiar tunes -- \\"Somewhere, Over the Rainbow\\" and \\"What a Wonderful World\\".I would have loved to have heard, respectively, the original Judy Garland and Louis Armstrong versions. However, what appeared in the film did the job -- and I can't get the tunes out of my head.    In conclusion, this movie is well worth watching, if you're into astronomy or if you have kids who are. I'm seriously looking forward to the DVD. Even in 2D, it will be worth it. For the first time, I can imagine why someone would want a giant-screen TV in their house. If ever I come into a large amount of money, maybe I'll build my own IMAX theater in the basement.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|Since there are not many others (if there are some) who can sing this type of music so good (I am refering to Back to basics as well) as Aguilera, I think that she should focus more on this kind and leave albums like bionic (which nevertheless was OK but it would not be missed by the world if it didn 't exist)aside.  A voice like that should not be wasted.   It was a thrill to hear the legend known as Cher again, whose new forthcoming album is much anticipated. Her voice still captures the magic.    I maintain some doubts if this album deserves to be rated with 5 stars, given that some (few) songs could be of higher quality, however the brilliant team which has collaborated for the whole result together with two of the most amazing voices in music history demand nothing less...
B00004KD1L|5.0|Vertigo is the album that brought Groove Armada into the big time, with good reason too. While it keeps most of the soul and groove of Northern Star, it also boasts better production values and some club-ready hits, like \\"I See You Baby\\" and \\"If Everybody Looked the Same.\\" But it also has the gorgeous downtempo tracks \\"Dusk You & Me,\\" \\"Serve Chilled,\\" and \\"Inside My Mind (Blue Skies)\\" and the slow jam \\"Pre 63.\\" And, of course, \\"At the River\\" is so good that it had to make a repeat appearance here. There's a romantic quality to the vocals of \\"Your Song,\\" which is put in counterpoint to the phat beats. You can hear their sound developing -- another strong entry in the Groove Armada legacy.

1594202842|5.0|This book was amazingly consuming. It has to do with the collectivistic hold on the family system as well as what to many westerners may seem as an extreme case of tough love that may border on abuse. The truth is, it's fascinating to watch the author realize that parenting isn't a one size fits all type of gig.

0307272702|3.0|The core argument is: calories in/calories out doesnt matter, just dont eat carbs.    What this misses is that it is FAR more difficult to overeat calories when you are not eating any carbs, be they complex, refined, or sugars.      So the advice is still good- you wont be having any pizza, ice cream, soda, burgers or fries.  Well you can have a burger but have you ever craved going to McDonalds for some pieces of meat and cheese you eat with a fork?    Atkins made much the same argument in the 70s and again in late 90s.  I think he had a resurgence in the late 90s because it was a necessary antidote to the \\"fat free\\" craze of the early 90s which was so misleading and damaging.      Skip the pseudo-science, take the advice.  Oh, and also some fruits.
0525950079|1.0|I so looked forward to this sequel to Pillars of the Earth.[[ASIN:045123281X The Pillars of the Earth]] I was always a big Ken Follett fan and was one of the few who fell in love with that first departure from his thriller format when it was published. World... plodded along with not enough color or action to the first chapters to hold my interest. This is the only Ken Follett novel I failed to finish. If you are a first time reader, try one of his others![[ASIN:0062020889 Triple]]
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I saw Adele's 2011 Brit Awards performance of 'Someone Like You' and her music video for 'Rolling In The Deep' and was completely blown away.<br />So I decided to purchase her cd...<br />I do not regret one moment purchasing this cd. Unbelievable!!!<br />I love all 11 tracks on the cd and have listened to this cd countless times - beginning to end - from the moment I got it.<br />Just completely amazing and beautiful.<br />What more can I say - can't say enough!
B00006EXL5|5.0|\\"Bullets\\" is a deliciously dark, jarring, haunting album. Intensely emotional, the raw first effort of a young band to get their ideas into musical form, it's definitely an acquired taste. Lyrically, it puts most artists to shame. However, the vocals are a lot rougher; the music in general is a bit more halting, even grating at times. MCR had not yet hit their stride, it seems, and the succeeding albums are a lot smoother. Not bad for a young band, but not the album you force a friend to listen to to make them a fan. Even if you prefer their more mature recordings, it's worth a listen just to see the evolution in the music. If you're like me, though, and you enjoy listening to extreme, sometimes unnerving music, this may be one of your favorite albums.
B0030ZOYJ0|5.0|Though much of this one, as oppose to the next, is pretty much just higher definition shots of the original anime, it is still great to see Evangelion making a comeback. And deservedly so. Many anime are forgotten over the years, but I was glad to watch this, though I'm looking forward to the next even more.    I scratched up the black covering of mind so I'm a little upset about that, but with a booklet, its a great set, though the extras leave much to be desired. The music for the credits is Beautiful World by Utada is gorgeous and fitting for the mood.    There is NO ASUKA in this first one. It covers roughly up to Rei and Shinji's first battle together; their first time really bonding.    For diehard fans, it felt a bit abrupt when they changed from scene to scene because things in the anime (had to be) were cut to fit a movie experience. Still they hit the important parts.     Overall a great product and series. Nothing worth scoffing at.

1416955070|2.0|Im not going to write a long review because it just wasn't a good read at all. I liked the first half but I just couldn't get through it after a few more chapters. It was just awful to read and I would not recommend this book. At all. Two starts for this book that should be buried and forgotten.
B0044KU7KU|5.0|Reaching a mainstream audience is not always a bad thing. \\"Danger Days\\" is My Chemical Romance's most accessible album yet. There's still a hint of that trademark melacholy (\\"Jet Star and the Kobra Kid\\"- enough said), but with enough hope and life to leave listeners in a good mood. Definitely a departure... Their music already had a lot of variety, but it's kicked up a few notches on this album. And Ray Toro gets to do a whole lot more shredding. Hurray!
B000059XUO|5.0|I remember when I went to see \\"The Crow\\" the first time.  My best Friend John Tong and I went to the Metroplex Theater in Fairfax, VA to go see this movie he kept talking about. I had never heard of it and hadn't been aware of the drama concerning Brandon Lee's untimely death.    What ensued was beautiful violent poetry, it may have been Brandon Lee's final performance but it was also his best. His portrayal of Eric Draven was vibrant and amazing, what could have been a very silly supernatural revenge story became something iconic. For a perfect example of how cheesy this film could have been look no further that the utterly cheesetastic and awesome 80's movie \\"The Wraith\\" starring Charlie Sheen & Randy Quaid, which features a similar premise only involving aliens and cars.    But director Alex Proyas created a masterpiece of true love, hate, revenge, and redemption. The atmosphere of the cinematography was pitch perfect as was it for the time revolutionary score of hard driving alt rock. All of the characters are vibrant even the thugs of T-Birds gang, and most especially the Villain \\"Top Dollar\\", (Michael Wincott)  and his sister Myca (Bai Ling). The Crow is one of the greatest comic book movies of all time and if you haven't seen it you owe it to yourself to watch it NOW. If you love movies \\"The Crow\\" belongs in your collection. If you're at all a romantic, this movie belongs in your collection.     JUST BUY IT NOW, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? WHY ARE YOU STILL READING THIS?
B000CCIVDO|4.0|These things have amazing sound quality. I DJ so I've used a good number of headphones and these suckers blew me away. Most people consider an increased base over mids/high tones to be good sound quality. That's understanding from people who have no idea about anything in sound, because bass sounds nicer to untrained hearing. This pair of headphones is manufactured by a audio equipment company, so sound quality is not their compromise. Strong balance and clarity is lows/mids/high ranges is key and these headphones deliver just that.    The let down is the build quality. The connection in the cord started to break within a month. The connection from one headphone to the other is loosely glued into the back of the headpiece which means it falls out. The otherall construction feels very cheap, plasticky and fragile. This headset is certainly not for heavy users.
0132350882|5.0|In response to the \\"Don't get the Kindle version\\" review -- the problems appear to be resolved now.  It looks fine on my Kindle 3 (aside from using proportional fonts in code examples, but this isn't too bad once you get used to it).  Also, as many other reviewers have pointed out, this is an excellent book.  I really wish all of my colleagues, predecessors, and managers had read it.  My job would be so much easier and more enjoyable if they had.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I'll be honest; I'm not a huge fantasy reader.  I've tried to read Lord of the Rings twice and don't get farther than book 1.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones is really good.  I liked it, but there are a few points that I want to mention.<br /><br />First, it's long and the point of view writing style means you'll forget some key facts throughout the novel.<br /><br />Second, Assumptions, George thought that I would know who \\"Ned\\" was the first time he mentions him.  (He's Eddard, I had to Google it).<br /><br />Third, I really don't get a care about Sansa or anything she does.  Why is she even a PoV character?  She was a waste of time, space, and her content is boring.<br /><br />Fourth, reading it on the Kindle was great, but having to go back and look for key facts, like what is \\"Ice\\"?  (It's Eddards sword).  And who the hell is Brynden?  The character and house summaries at the end of the novel would have been gravy at the beginning.  I wish I knew that it existed before I finished it.<br /><br />A few negative points, but overall a good story.  I just hope it doesn't turn into Robert Jordan's Book 10 tea description in a later book.  (I've thought about getting into that series as well).
B003BW0CB6|4.0|Since 1992, Los Angeles crime novelist has been coming out with one, and occasionally two, novels per year. With only a few exceptions, his protagonists have been drawn from a shifting and intersecting cast of characters in the LAPD, the Los Angeles legal community, and the FBI.<br /><br />In Connelly's latest novel, The Reversal, defense attorney Mickey Haller is in the spotlight, with his half-brother, Harry Bosch, a veteran homicide inspector, and Haller's ex-wife, Maggie McPherson (\\"Maggie McFierce\\"), in key supporting roles. The trio takes on the prosecution of a child-killer convicted in 1986 and just released from prison on an appeal based on newly reviewed DNA evidence.<br /><br />The Reversal is brilliantly plotted, with suspense building from the first page to the last. The basic elements of the story are told in the first person from Haller's voice, the rest in the third person from Bosch's perspective. It's a masterful job -- another superb piece of work from one of the genre's proven masters.<br /><br />(From [...])

B003YFIUW8|3.0|This book was suspenseful and entertaining, though the writing style irritated me after a while. I didn't think it was particularly realistic at times. Sometimes the plot moved a little slowly, but the climax of the story was over too quickly. Worth reading, but not amazing.
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|I recieved the movie in a timely manner and it came as was described. I am pleased with my purchase.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|I should admit that I love R&B and a good love story.  That said, \\"The Bodyguard\\" script does have something to say:  For me, it's about that very human experience of being in a work situation, a role, a situation, and having to deal with those impulses and emotions that sometimes conflict with our ability to be successful, or ethical, or even, honest with ourselves.  Kevin Costner was perfect for this production and carried it off, as one of his better performances.  Of course, reality would not be so dramatic, but by the time the climax occurs, we are rooting for the good guy, and can't really turn back.  You might say, \\"The Bodyguard\\" story is really a Western in urban clothing.  Anyway, Whitney is well cast, and does a good job to remain natural and not attempt to overact.  The soundtrack has lots to like and Mick Jackson's direction was excellent; he also did \\"L.A. Story\\".
B004EBT5CU|4.0|So, I couldn't wait for this new CD to hit the market.  Maybe my expectations were unrealistic since Adele's 19 CD was so amazing.  Perhaps, I just need to listen to it a bit more to get into it.  I'm not sorry I bought it but like I said, it's not as good as her first CD.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Wow! I love this product...I've been waiting a very long time for something I thought would enhance my flight simming, and I'm impressed with this. I just spent 2 hours learning how to set up my new G13 because there's little help on the Internet regarding the G13 with FSX. (That's my only reason for the 3-star on ease of use--but if you're willing to put in the time it will pay off.)  This thing is going to become an essential part of my home flight simulator setup. The G13 an example of a brilliantly designed product...the setup process, and profile setting software is amazing and powerful.  It's extremely well organized...but it's a lot of information, so don't think you're going to plug & play this puppy.  There's no manual--I used the tutorial and also much of it is self-explanatory. Let me save you some time:  FSX is not on the list of supported games, but don't worry.  The key thing I found was that it's easiest to modify the DEFAULT profile because that is the one that the game board will use if it can't associate itself with a specific game. (And it won't associate with FSX or my addons as far as I can tell.) IMPORTANT: In the \\"Key Profiler\\" software you use to set up the device:  Select \\"SETTINGS\\" then click on \\"PROFILER\\" in the drop down menu.  Next select the \\"PROFILE\\" tab.  On the profile tab screen select the option \\"ENABLE PERSISTENT PROFILE.\\"  Voila!  Now I can now control FSX and my addons with one profile.  I've tested it so far and it's working: My G13 is now able to control my CENTER and PAUSE function on my Track Ir5 head tracker, while, (for example) I use the thumb joystick for a quick way to Zoom In and Zoom Out in FSX views.  I have button G15 set as PUSHBACK with G16 as \\"1\\" (which will turn the tail right on pushback...but also do double-duty in selecting option one in the ATC window).  I have button G17 programmed as \\"2\\" which can turn the tail right during pushback, or select option two in the ATC window as needed.  MORE TIPS:  I recommend assigning MACROS to the buttons and NOT keystrokes. For example I named a macro \\"1 - Right\\" for button G15 instead of just assigning the keystroke \\"1\\".  This way I can print out a diagram of my keyboard layout that doesn't just say \\"1\\" on it.  I name macros like \\"THRUST REVERSE\\" and record 8 instances of the keystroke \\"F2\\" because you have to repeat F2 on this device to get full thrust reverser deployment (but I'm still playing around with this one). When I press a button that has a macro the display TELLS me the name of the MACRO!  That is fantastic...because it's on a lighted LCD display I can see in the dark at 1:00 am when I'm approaching DFW in heavy traffic in my little Citation Mustang (instead of going to bed as I should). In any case, by creating named macros for everything I can easily reassign commands by names I recognize to different buttons.  OTHER IDEAS:  In my case I want to be able to load Track Ir5, REX 2.0, etc. before FSX.  I have the first row of buttons G1 to G7 set up as shortcuts to load my programs. The second row of buttons I have set up to quickly open views that I need to move over to my second monitor:  GPS, radios, throttle quadrant, autopilot, etc.d assigning MACROS to the buttons and NOT keystrokes.

B002ZG99G8|4.0|SOME SPOILERS  It's hard not to like this one. We get a group fighting for Uncle Sam, only to discover that he can be very dirty indeed! This would be in the form of Jason Patric, who perfectly plays a CIA scumbag. Considering the nature and breadth of America's crimes (especially of recent), it's nice to see the empire being cast in a villainous light, even if this is a fun action movie. Patric even schemes to fake terrorism for his own purposes.  The cast gels very well, the performances strong all around. As a fan of the Boris Grishenko character in Goldeneye, I was delighted by the similar character here. I was glad they didn't kill off the Jason Patric character. I haven't read the comic, but I love the lead here and think he epitomizes a cool comic book character in his performance. Now if only we could have a movie of the Hitman comics!
1423101502|4.0|Interesting, a fast read which is nice.  Good to learn all the major and minor Olympian gods.  Was not quite the bang ending I was expecting, but much more along the \\"Hero's Journey\\" that a good greek myth follows.  I do wish the author would utilize proper grammar since he is being a model for youth; i.e: \\"Annabeth and me\\".  *sigh*.
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|Here in the United States, we have are not in short supply of talent.  However, few people from other countries have the power to infiltrate their way into the American music market quite like Adele.  With her smash hit \\"Chasing Pavements\\", Adele made her way into American ipods.  With \\"21\\", Adele has continued this trend of actual talent with songs that are dark, haunting, catchy, real, and showcase her extraordinary voice that needs no autotune.  The lead single \\"Rolling In The Deep\\" has a haunting bluesy feel that makes you want to foot tap with its constant baseline.  It has lyrics that can speak to all of us and it never gets old.  My one friend and I can still sing along to this song and we never grow tired of it--even though we have been listening to it ever since it came out.  I absolutely love Adele and all of the other new \\"brIT girls\\" hitting the American music market and shaking things up with their blue-eyed soul sound.  I would recommend \\"21\\" to anyone looking for a singer with real talent.
0307454541|2.0|You know that cliched scene in superhero comics, when the villain has our hero tied to a chair and is about to kill him...then stops to explain at length how and why he committed his crimes? And as this scene goes on and on and on, you're thinking the whole time, \\"Stop talking and kill him! He's Batman! He's going to escape!\\"<br /><br />This is lazy, cliched writing at its worst, and when this exact moment occurred in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, I realized I've gotta stop believing that \\"International Bestseller\\" translates to any sort of quality.<br /><br />First, let's talk about the positive. Larsson's researcher-turned-detective, Lisbeth Salander, is a fantastic anti-hero. She's that classic underdog character we love to root for, the one society judges for her unusual looks and behavior, only to underestimate her vast intellect. And nothing is better than when a kid like Salander gets her comeuppance.<br /><br />Second, Larrson is very talented at describing his locales, so much so that reading this book is like taking a vacation to Sweden, from wind-swept Stockholm to a snow-covered island.<br /><br />Third, Larrson is really, really imaginative at creating back story. The book concerns the disappearance of a girl named Harriet Vanger, and the family history you learn could fill a book all in itself, almost as extensive as all those notebooks Tolkien filled with Middleearth lore. You learn about fathers and mothers, uncles and aunts, nieces and nephews, grand nieces and nephews, and you can't help but get overwhelmed by the information. Protagonist Blomkvist remarks as such numerous times throughout the book. In a way, this tightly knit tapestry creates a vivid backdrop for the story.<br /><br />In another way, however, it ultimately leads to a VERY disappointing second half. There are INFINITE amounts of disparate threads of information, so much so that either 1) this had all better amount to something greater, or 2) we're basically reading unnecessary color, like if Tolkien had included The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.<br /><br />The book starts off as a cold case historical mystery, in which Blomkvist must research the mysterious disappearance of one Harriet Vanger back in 1966. He settles into his cottage on the Vanger property and delves into photos and newspaper archives. It's not action packed, but it's certainly very enjoyable and exciting in its slow but intelligent build.<br /><br />And then, out of nowhere, the novel takes a major right turn into B-movie silliness. All that family history? Out the window, except for a few choice bits. The killer? Cribbed from Se7en, more accurately, every Se7en knock-off movie that has since come out. The motivation? Off the charts. The setting? Silly Dan Brown-esque places.<br /><br />This is what most disappointed me - that entire slow build, that rich tapestry of characters, that progression of historical information - is all for not. When you find out whodunnit, you're sort of like \\"Oh. Is that all?\\" And when our hero finds himself trapped in a situation like the Batman scenario described above, I nearly tossed the book in the garbage.<br /><br />Look, I have NO problem with a Hannibal Lechter-style killer, or a biblically-motivated Se7en-esque serial killer...But you can't plunk Hannibal Lechter down in a Poirot novel, at least not without making sure the pieces all gel together. The fact that this book is used to explore the issue of female abuse goes from interesting to tacky and unbelievable.<br /><br />What could have been a tightly written yet epic mystery ultimately felt insanely bloated - why did I have to know so much detail about the Vanger family? One thing Larrson is pretty terrible at is hinting, either overtly or subtly, at things to come. It's not that he's above it - he tries push a red herring or two, but (and maybe this is the translation), you're never really given anything to go \\"Ohhhhhhh, maybe this person could be involved,\\" or \\"Hmmm, now that I know that, X seems like a likely suspect.\\" I'm not talking about something as obvious as a game of Clue, but a good mystery/thriller author can weave this sort of storytelling without the reader even being aware of it, a way of keeping what would otherwise be a slow narrative moving. Larrson fails here, and it seriously hurts the book.<br /><br />When the final mystery is outed, the book goes into Hollywood b-movie territory for a long stretch. Then, when it should end, it goes on...and on...and on...and on...There's a subplot involving a corrupt investor, who Blomkvist is seeking revenge on for shaming him before the country. It'd dealt with early on, then tangentially throughout, then returns to finish the book...and wow, it literally won't end. Larrson eventually races through it with a series of emails, a coda that could have been written in about five pages stretched to ridiculous lengths.<br /><br />I'll reiterate the positive: great character in Salander, fantastic settings, rich backstory. The actual plot/mystery/story? Not worth your time. I think a lot of people enjoy being in this world, and I certainly did...for a couple hundred pages. After than, I'd like to actually get somewhere worthwhile with it all.suspect.\\" I'm not talking about something as obvious as a game of Clue, but a good mystery/thriller author can weave this sort of storytelling without the reader even being aware of it, a way of keeping what would otherwise be a slow narrative moving.

0385737955|3.0|Maybe a 3.5 star.<br />The concept is great.<br />I can see why it is compared to the Hunger Games, but it should not be taken as a STRONG relation.  This does not have the depth or cohesiveness of Hunger Games.<br />The characters here, definatley could have used a little more depth, better interactions.  They really felt flat most times and the interactions forced.<br />I found a few descriptions  or series of events kind of hard to follow. (the Grievers are one)  I also was annoyed with how often someone \\"just knew\\" what was \\"right\\" or this is just what we do or did....<br />I also did not like the \\"slang\\" it was too crude for who they were.  And making up all the words that were supposed to come across as curse words just did not flow well or set that ton right.  The end did end up having me hooked for the 2nd book and so far I am enjoying that a bit more than the first :).  Meaning that there is good growth in the events.. Growth in events but frustrations with characters.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|I have pals that are happy to play involved Euro games. I also have pals who'd prefer to toss back a few drinks and chat over games. This appeases both crowds. The strategy is similar to Yahtzee but is easier to score. The theme is also MUCH more fun! I ended up buying multiple copies over the holidays to give as gifts after my friends were raving about this game.

B003WH765U|4.0|I rated this with 4 stars only because the acting seemed stilted and dated.  Never-the-less this film is definately worth seeing (the book, the ending in particular since the film does not go that far, is more so worth reading).  Just because the film and the setting are dated in a particular time does not reduce the significance of the issues.  Have we changed our attitudes since then?  Frankly, as an American I am ashamed of the treatment of and attitudes toward people from other cultures, races, or religious backgrounds.  Hopefully those viewing this film will consider those issues as may be in effect today.  This is a film worth buying and watching.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I am totally pleased with my purchase of the Zoom H4n.  It's ability to do 2 channel, 4 channel and 4 track recording gives me the flexibility to record live performances in several ways.  It's solid, well built and well engineered.  I highly recommend this recorder to any audiophile looking to capture concerts, private sessions, rehearsals and the like.  Two thumbs up!

0061906220|5.0|Not sure what School Library Journal reviewer is talking about.  Do not let their review sway you from ordering the book for your kids/library/school!!!  I'm a children's librarian and have used this book in my outreach to childcare centers and the kids always beg me to read the book again.  In fact, I just read it to a class of 5 year-olds this morning and they were still singing the refrain as I headed out the door.  Who cares if the moral of the story doesn't hold the power of Aesop?  It's not what this book is about.  This book is about kids having fun, interacting with the text, and enjoying a story!

030746363X|5.0|I have been a yo-yo dieter for over 30 years.  I gained and lost the same 100 pounds about 5 times.  I needed something simple and easy (very hectic life) so on November 29th, 2010, I started the diet where you drink 2 \\"shakes\\" a day and have 1 sensible meal.  I also began exercising 1 hour every day.  I have not missed a day of exercise since (today: 2/24/11).  By then 3rd week in January (7 weeks!) I had lost FIVE pounds.  I was extremely frustrated.  I saw Tim Ferriss on Dr. Oz's show and heard him tell the story that his Dad had lost 5 pounds in a month, and by the addition of one thing - drinking/eating 30 grams of protein within 30  minutes of waking, started to lose almost 18 pounds a month.  Thats incredible !  So I ordered the book on Amazon.com and started the protein regimen the next morning.  Within FOUR days I felt like I had lost a little weight and I felt good !  No afternoon energy crash, felt good all day.  The book arrived and I started the diet Jan 31st  - today is Feb 24, 24 days - and I look and feel as if I've lost about 15 pounds !  (I havent weighed yet) -- I have lost 3 inches off my waist.  This is 20 pounds of fat loss in a month.  That is what I have been looking for all my life !  And I've found it.  Thanks, Tim !!!!!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|My sister shared these books with me, with the Kindle.  I read the whole series in a week, would have been shorter, but I had to work and sleep.   It was a great ride of a story and I was very sad when it ended.   I recommend it for adults who like action, thriller, science fiction or adventure genres.  If you are looking for a major love story, you might be disappointed, this isn't the Twilight series (thank gods!).  I am looking forward to the movies to see how closely they will get to my imagination.

0385732554|4.0|I liked the book, The Giver, because it told you what life would be like if we lived in a \\"perfect\\" world. The story is quite confusing though. It took me a couple of chapters to realize that Jonas calling himself an Eleven, or a Twelve, wasn't a typo, and they really say, \\"Congrats, Sally, on becoming an Eight.\\"   The book also made me thankful for what I have. In the book, no one besides the Giver, who is the Reciver of Memories, and Jonas, a boy in training to become the Reciever of Memories, knows about all the joyous, and sad, and colorful things in the past. Like playing games with your grandparents, sledding through snow, or lying out on a beach on a sunny day. In this \\"perfect\\" world, there is no color. There is black and white, no red or blue, or purple. Everything is perfect.  Towards the end of the book the Giver and Jonas device a plan to escape. I still don't know exactly what this plan is. I thought the entire time Jonas was escaping the village, riding through the trees on his bike, and sleeping under bushes, that he was going to jump in a river and drown himself. I thought that because the Giver and Jonas had talked about it a few times.   As I said, it's confusing, but it's a good read. It makes you think about what your life would be like if you lived in the town with Jonas, in a world where everything is decided for you.
B000006342|5.0|This album is one of the classic pop/rock albums of the mid-80s.  My question is, Is this album truly re-mastered and re-issued--as it is labeled by Amazon here?  I purchased this supposedly remastered album to replace my original cd copy, but nowhere on the disc or booklet does it mention a remastering.  Has anyone else noticed this?
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Pros:  -the product description says it's a DVD-R but you wouldn't know if they didn't tell you - it looks completely like a store-bought DVD in every way (packaging, disk, etc)  -the content is absolutely amazing - probably one of my favorite films (especially for Whedon fans)  Cons:  -none
B0021L8UPS|4.0|Simply put, Isabelle Fuhrman dominates the screen as Esther, a cute 9-year-old Russian girl adopted by a loving family that wishes to fill the void of a recent pregnancy that resulted in a stillborn.  Adopted by John and Kate (Peter Sarsgaard and Vera Farmiga, respectively), Esther soon ratchets up the mystery and tension in this suspense thriller.  At odds are the family's two children; innocent Max (Aryana Engineer), who forms a quick bond with Esther, and surly Daniel (Jimmy Bennett), who irritated me and Esther from the very moment the camera began rolling.<br /><br />Esther appears to be a great addition to the family, what with her old-fashioned appearance, ribbons and dress like a Little Bo Peep story, but soon enough Kate becomes more curious and suspicious of the talented little girl's background.  Meanwhile, John plays the role of doormat, making bad decisions and letting his somewhat abrasive wife dominate screen time.  Rather than pimping their children out for reality show riches, this John and Kate bicker weakly about their new daughter and the effect she is having on their family.<br /><br />What unfolds is an exercise in tension and patience.  While Kate slowly unravels the mystery, Esther shows wisdom by manipulating everyone towards her side.  Those against her?  Not so lucky.<br /><br />The most compelling part of Orphan, and what saved the film's slow pace, was the performance of Fuhrman.  At 11-years old she possesses the acting chops to pull off a flawless Russian accent while displaying emotional range of which most adults are incapable.  With a flick of the emotional switch, she changes from innocent to sadistic, friendly to evil.  A very convincing performance.<br /><br />For once it seems Hollywood was capable of making a movie that didn't rely on the one-second shock scares.  Dark to light.  Quiet to loud.  This pleased me quite a bit while watching this movie.  Director Jaume Collet-Serra and screenplay writer David Johnson have created an ambitious film that doesn't fit into the mold of most current horror or suspense thrillers; what they have made is almost old-fashioned.  There is very little in the way of ambiguity; what's evil is evil, what's good is good.  It's up to the viewer to follow a path.  Regardless of choice, the ending is quite a surprise.<br /><br />Jason Elint into the mold of most current horror or suspense thrillers; what they have made is almost old-fashioned.

B004DI7HZ6|3.0|I am enjoying this book.  There are a few parts with the romantic relationship between Alice and Matthew that are silly, but over all, the story line keeps your attention.  There are surprises that are uncovered.  Good amount of historical content as well.  I would recommend this book to my friends.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|\\"The Social Network\\" captures the zeitgeist of the moment better than any movie of recent times.<br /><br />This Aaron Sorkin adaptation of the Ben Mezrich nonfiction novel, \\"The Accidental Billionaires,\\" purports to tell the story of Mark Zuckerberg, the co-founder of Facebook, who rose from simple Harvard student to become the youngest billionaire in the world. I say \\"purports\\" because clearly the movie takes certain liberties with many of the facts of the story (most egregiously, perhaps, the fact that Zuckerberg actually had a girlfriend during the time depicted here) and, thus, the movie isn't really all that valuable as a documentary account of the way things actually went down. What the movie does do incredibly well is to capture the mood of an era and to tell a compelling story for our times.<br /><br />One of \\"The Social Network's\\" greatest strengths is its willingness to feature a protagonist who is not all that easy to like. As portrayed in the film, Zuckerberg is a brilliant, amoral, petulant, socially inept, overcompensating nerd who doesn't really care who he hurts on his way to the top. Yet, oddly, Zuckerberg seems to have no real yen for fame and fortune; indeed his initial impetus for creating Facebook seems to arise as much out of a desire to get back at his girlfriend for breaking up with him as to become rich and famous (those being mere ancillary benefits). Zuckerberg also spends much of his time trying to backstab those around him, including his best friend and roommate, Eduardo Severin, who is the initial source of funding for the project and who becomes the tale's ethical counterweight to the morally bankrupt Zuckerberg. But Zuckerberg is also eventually sued by the Winklevoss brothers, some fellow Harvard students, for allegedly appropriating their initial social-networking idea and making it his own.  Zuckerberg's motive for being a first-class jerk seems to be jealousy born out of his inability to fit in with the \\"jock\\" class at the school. Yet, every attempt he makes at ingratiating himself with others - particularly women - only serves to reinforce the sociopathic nature of his personality.<br /><br />Yet, there's something about Zuckerberg that keeps him from becoming entirely loathsome and that actually makes us identify with him to some extent.  Perhaps, it's that very awkwardness - that inability to master or even understand the social codes by which relationships work - that makes Zuckerberg a more sympathetic figure than he perhaps deserves to be. As one of the characters late in the film says in assessing his character, \\"You're not an a-hole, Mark; you're just trying so hard to be.\\" Or perhaps it's the subtlety and depth that Jesse Eisenberg brings to the role that results in that effect.<br /><br />\\"The Social Network\\" is like a fine Greek tragedy being played out in modern dress, except that Zuckerberg's \\"fall\\" occurs mainly in the realm of human relationships and fineness of character and not of fame, fortune or status (since Zuckerberg still seems to have all three still pretty much intact at this point). When, at the end, the creator of Facebook sits all alone at a laptop, having lost the one person who was ever really a true friend to him, and meekly asks permission to use the law office's computer, we see the tragic emptiness of a man who's sold his soul to the devil - if, indeed, he had a soul to sell in the first place.  It is that ambiguity that lifts \\"The Social Network\\" above the traditional morality play and makes it speak directly to our time.<br /><br />There is literally not a single performance - whether major or minor - in this film that is less than outstanding. In addition to Eisenberg, there is tremendous work from Andrew Garfield as Eduardo; the perpetually underrated Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker, the crassly manipulative creator of Napster; and Armie Hammer as the Harvard rowing twins (lots of CGI here) who fall victim to Zuckerberg's conniving - and become surprisingly sympathetic figures as a result. There are also fine performances from Rashida Jones (\\"Parks and Recreation\\") and David Selby (Quentin Collins from \\"Dark Shadows\\" for the really old-timers in the audience), among many others.<br /><br />As director, David Fincher keeps the movie racing along at a breakneck pace while maintaining a complex balance between flashbacks and flash forwards that at no time become confusing for the audience.  Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross have also composed a simple but haunting piano score that nicely underlines the seriousness of the piece. Fincher and Sorkin make every moment count, and the final confrontation between Zuckerberg and Eduardo - in which years of unspoken resentments suddenly erupt to the surface - is the most dramatically explosive scene I've seen in ages.<br /><br />For all its topicality and relevance, \\"The Social Network\\" definitely seems more attuned to the down side of modern technology than the upside (see the recent populist uprisings in Egypt), highlighting how obsessive social networking can lead people to behave in ways that tear at the very fabric that holds society together.  After all, in the old days, one could vent one's grievances against others in private and be done with it.  Now, with the ability to do near-constant blogging, our hurtful words, petty tantrums and malicious actions can go out to a mass audience, ruin other people's reputations, then come back and bite us big time in the end.  That's the lesson Zuckerberg is forced to learn all throughout the movie - and it is one we would all be wise to heed.lt.

0345528581|5.0|This type of work out done properly and on a regular basis is perfect for those who cannot get to a gym or don't want too go to a gym. Mr. Lauren knows what he is teaching and teaches it very well. I use his work outs between gym visits or while at work on an occasional break, I recommend this book even for a beginner it is full of knowledge of the Anatomy and Kinesiology of a strength building moves.

030746363X|4.0|I am about to finish my 3rd week on the slow carb portion of the book. My weight has done some crazy things including dropping 10 lbs in a week, shooting up 6 lbs in 2 days and dropping 4lbs in one day. However, I've averaged 3lbs a week lost. Maybe I just need a better scale. My hunger for carbs has not lessened in the least but that makes my weekly cheat day like a holiday.<br /><br />Even if you don't think this plan will work, or you aren't really interested in losing fat/building muscle this is a very entertaining read. I had to stop reading it at work because I kept laughing at the stories.<br /><br />If you do give it a shot for fat loss I have one bit of advice. If you stall out, give it a few days. I almost went on a donut rampage this morning because in four days the scale had gone up one pound and not down any. I dragged myself out of bed and got on the scale, 4lbs lost.
B003YBNRHU|5.0|Fantastic album. Any Doobies fan has to have it! In what sounds sort of like a sequel to \\"Listen to the Music,\\" Tom Johnston declares that \\"now they say that it's [rock and roll] a young man's game, and that's who is burnin' the flame, but they seem to forget who shot the rocket out of the hole.\\" And, \\"I'll tell ya what don't work for me, the crazy ideology that says playin' that rock and roll is just a young man's game.\\" And the Doobies blast that myth with this album, bringing back one of their original hits for an incredible update. Back awhile ago, when the Eagles got back together, they were amazed that they could get back so quickly, that they were better singers and players than back when they were young. It is the same with the Doobies. That they can make great rock and roll is a given. I remember seeing the band in concert many years ago: they just got up and played, and they were an incredibly tight live act. Well, they sure haven't lost anything. In fact, Tom Johnston's voice is better than ever -- he is a bit more restrained without losing the power and punch. Pat Simmons voice has definitely changed, sounding maybe a bit lower in pitch with more vibrato, but it is every bit as good as ever, just maybe a bit different. These guys prove that they can still write, play, and sing and sound to me like they are at the top of their game. They are smart guys, too. Every band needs a John McFee, a guy who can play anything with strings and can add background, drive solos, or anything in between without getting into Pat's or Tom's way when they play lead. And those two guys can still play great guitar. They have pulled in some great musicians, especially Billy Payne with some incredible keyboards and piano.<br /><br />\\"Nobody\\" was one of their first hits, and for this album, John McFee and Pat Simmons wrote a long intro for resonator/slide and acoustic guitar, but it remains a Tom Johnston song. This version is so rich with extra sound and fantastic playing that it is even better than the original. I think that an objective and honest critic, even one who did not especially like the music, would have to say that this band has exceptional playing and singing talent. The return of Ted Templemann as producer seems to have been a great reunion.<br /><br />There are two versions of the album. The Deluxe version has two additional tracks (both of the same quality as the rest of the songs) and a DVD with a way-too-short video of 30 some years of footage and a video of \\"Nobody.\\" I agree with an earlier reviewer that this version, even without the DVD is worthwhile for the two bonus tracks. And the DVD is fun, but it leaves you wanting more footage. Get this album, folks!better than the original.

B004GCQ2WS|1.0|If you have any of the other one love albums, this CD is not worth it. Guetta, quit re-releasing your one love album with different names with most of the same tracks and only one or 2 new tracks. one love, one more love, one love special edition, one love 2010, it's hard to keep track... Between all the different editions you can fill 2 cds worth of distinct music but have to weed through tons of duplicate tracks on itunes. What they should have done is come out with a new album name and put all the bonus tracks from all the re-releases into one album. Coming from someone who has the original album, having to buy each new album for 1 or 2 tracks is a pain in the you know what. Even hunting down the new tracks through the download store is a huge pain. There isn't even a tracking listing for this album.....
B002GYVRRI|4.0|I got my set directly from Amazon.  My only complaint is that when I examined the cd, it had a deep scratch on it.  So you might want to check out your cd/dvd before playing.    This album was very elusive when I wanted it back in high school.  It had gone out of print, and I could only get it on 8-track.  I also purchased the vinyl re-release in the 80's.    This edition is the cd I've been waiting for, and I'm glad I got it.  In my opinion, this is the best lineup of King Crimson, and their most consistent album.    The dvd has a great live video performance.  Robert Fripp has complained about poor quality video bootlegs.  He's been telling us for years that there was no live footage worthy of sale!  Seeing these videos, I have to disagree (although a couple of songs are, indeed, marred by the French's goofy use of color and video effects as someone else indicated.)      Bob: it's time to gather up all those old video performances and put them on one dvd so your true fans can enjoy them!

0545265355|4.0|This is  a gripping series - I agree with the others who say that you will  not be able to put it down once you start reading.  The pacing is masterful,  except for the beginning of the second book which drags a bit.    The concept, while not all that original, was well executed.  So why four  stars?  I read another post-apocalyptic book recently, The Road  by Cormac McCarthy.  While entertaining, Hunger Games do not  even come close.  I know that the audiences are different, but stil...

B004DMIIVO|5.0|I cannot recommend this title highly enough. The visuals are stunning, especially in the OZ sequences and equal for the real world. The story, equally as well done, will keep you watching until the very end. The movie is a great adventure for those seeking a thought provoking and fun title to entertain whenever you watch. Don't pass up this title!
B001U3Y5XE|4.0|This game is best when Legos you already have are added to it, as it does not come with many Lego pieces.      the game does not come with very good instructions, they are left up to interpretation leaving room for confusion and inconsistency. its easier to modify rules that are preset to accommodate family need, then to make new ones.     over all we have lots of fun with the game now that we have the rules in place and have added extra Lego pieces.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|It was basically brand new and my daughter loves the movie. And I recieved it sooner than expected. Thank you!
1600595871|5.0|I don't often write reviews, simply because most books just don't move me that much...but Alisa Golden has certainly done that with this great title. I have faked my way through binding a few books on my own but a friend suggested I purchase this title if I wanted to really know what I was doing and was she ever right. Alisa has written an all encompassing book that instructs in such a way that the reader becomes the student without feeling talked down to. I have learned so much from Ms. Golden between the covers of this book and, with all it contains, I will be continuing to learn for months and years to come. This will certainly be a keeper in my studio library for sure. Thank you, Alisa; I will become a bookbinder with epic knowledge, thanks to you.

B0036TGSR6|4.0|A well composed suspense piece that, in the spirit of a Hitchcock film, throws an ordinary man into an extraordinary situation of mounting horror.  There are a number of name actors and actresses in this picture, including Eli Wallach (who is arguably best known as the \\"ugly dude\\" in THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY), who easily pump up the quality of this film.  Polansksi and his people do a wonderful job of making this a creepy experience tone and emotion at the forefront.  The ending is well done but some people won't agree or understand the long range implications and rationales.  Overall this is arguably the best suspense for its year or at least in the top three.  Pierce Brosnan, as usual, is Sterling Silver in his performance.  The film is an adaption of a novel by Robert Harris, who also wrote the screenplay.  Note that Brosnan's character was inspired by British Prime Minister Tony Blair. CHARACTER/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B plus to A minus; SUSPENSE: B plus to A minus; OVERALL GRADE: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: 02/16/2011.

0143038419|2.0|I just finished this book after months and months and months of reading it. Not because I am a slow reader or because I didn't have time, but because I disliked it that much. Normally if a book is good it doesn't take me anytime to read it. But I just couldn't get through this one. I noticed that people either felt greatly inspired by this book or completely hated it. I didn't find much inspiration. Maybe because I already plan to travel to another country to learn a language with a study abroad program and because I am already working on my relationship with God. To me this book wasn't the aha awakening moment that some people think it is. There is not really that much depth to it. And it not something that those of us who are not priveledged enough to have money to check out of reality for a year can relate to. And quite frankly it was rather boring. I got so tired of reading about her eating food and crying all of the time!    I would tell you to go see the movie and save your time, but sadly the movie was worse than the book. Of course the plot was changed and there was somehow even less depth to the characters. It was boring also, and I found myself on my computer with it playing in the background.    On a positive note. The author is well written. And as someone who always appreciates learning new things, I did appreciate the detail that she gives about the practice of meditation. I do wish her the best with her life.     And if you are considering reading this book, perhaps you would find your time better spent by asking some unfortunate soul who did read it to give you a summary.

B000001GX5|4.0|Bought this CD primarily for the track of Boccherini's Passacalle.  This track is a delight, but I should have bought the MP3.  The rest of the CD is 'heavy duty' Berlin Philharmonic, and totally out of keeping with the Passacalle.  If you're after chamber music, this CD isn't it - do a search on 'duets violin cello'.  Which is not to fault this CD, just my choice!
B000MGUZM0|5.0|Arcade Fire always reminds me of those cool kids on the block who are defiante towards their parents. The lead singer's voice holds such conviction and passion, yet youthful playfulness. Each song's repetitive nature implants an addictive nature, which can only be placated by furthering listening. Arcade Fire certainly gives religious overtones, abstract lyrics, sythetic sounds, and lush orchestra accompaniments (the organ!). The great thing is that these cool kids will hang out with anyone, so sit back and listen.
0143116738|5.0|I found this book more readable than his previous book.  It flowed much better so that the content is much more accessible.  The content is, of course, the point of the book and I loved the basic outline of the entire idea.  It's original and inspiring and gives a lot of information that I didn't know on not just people and their great careers but much more.
B004CAV7JC|4.0|I have been a fan for awhile now and I really enjoy the new CD. I won't bore you with all the details, but if you love MCR you won't be disappointed here. My favorite song is Na Na Na (Na Na Na.....). Obviously this is some type of concept CD. The boys say it is inspired by their love of Sci-fi films. The videos more so than the music will show that direction. There are a ton of possible singles here and I say explore the whole CD. 4.5 stars.
B003VBVQKS|4.0|When I bought this album in Nov. '75 I loved it instantly, it had really transformed into new writers and a new band. I like to think of it as the only Purple 'Summer' album, unlike say In Rock. It has a terrific Jazz bass sound and the best drum sound Ian Paice had recorded, yet it was definitely his sound. Disc 2 of this pack, while fixing the rusty guitar sound loses the presence on the bass and drums. As if a very light blanket was placed over them. The drums and bass sound are more say, anybody's. The 2 quiet passages in You Keep on Moving do not have 2 only distinct Coverdale and Hughes vocals singing harmony in stereo separation but many vocal tracks mainly dominated by Hughes parts. This was also a great outro album track. Disc one is great as was the earlier remaster release, but not as big a sound and image as say a moving coil to disc transfer from Jap. or German vinyl.
B000OPOAM0|5.0|The Terminator is probably the best if not the best action/sci fi movie of the 1980s and is one of the franchises that's still going today.  I first seen this movie sometime after the second movie had came out to video and upon seeing the movie it was like one of the best movies I had ever seen at the time.  Even to this day I'm not sure what it is about The Terminator that I liked over the years probably cause the kind of story that it tells throughout it, one thing I don't see in many movies that I watch.  It's like a romance movie disguised as a action/sci movie, though I'm not one for those kind of movies but when it's like this I don't mind it at all.<br /><br />James Cameron did well when he went about making this franchise the way that it is with the writing and the direction that he took the movie.  The acting itself has a superb cast with it and I don't know if there's many 80s movies that have a cast like with 'The Terminator'.  This movie is not meant to be confused by some really low budget movie called 'The Terminators', that movie don't come anywhere near to what this movie is like nor does it have a story like this does.  Overall I give The Terminator 5 stars out of 5.
B003X73QA8|2.0|With none of the anger, decadence and anarchy of the Sex Pistols punk, and none of  Sting or Stewart's talent and dynamics in the Police's New Wave magnificence, this lame record fails flat in retro New Wave Punk mediocrity.
B002ZE85YW|3.0|With a bit of a disappointing movie called 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines', about six years later, we get 'Terminator Salvation'.  To me Terminator Salvation felt more of a Terminator movie than that of T3, and it seemed like the people involved understood the mythology of the Terminator franchise that was made popular by James Cameron.  Unlike the first three movies which involved people or machines going back in time, this time it's set sometime after the future had happened, the Resistance vs Skynet.  While there are somethings that I liked how they went about making nods to the movies done by James Cameron and was interesting how they went about showing that, never expecting the one thing around the end of the movie.<br /><br />The writing is one thing that I think is better with this compared to the third movie and the director McG seemed to understand the franchise better than what I think that Mostow did.  While the future that is envisioned in Salvation may look a little different than what was shown in Cameron's Terminator movies.  With Salvation is in the early stages of the war or that McG wanted to show how the war may have been than that compared to what Cameron had envision for when he done the movies.  Though I never thought that DVD owners wouldn't have a Director's Cut of the movie that was originally made it rated 'R' like the first three, but only thing is that there's only like around two extra minutes added to it.  The extras there isn't that many with the DVD release but a good chance to see some behind the scenes look.  Overall I give it 3.5 stars out of 5.
1416550550|4.0|For me, The Forgotten Garden seemed to have a split personality.  I thoroughly enjoyed the plot and the story line.   But, oh the details!  I agree with so many other reviewers: there is too many details and the book would have benefitted greatly from a good editor.   The details often detracted from the plot and made it difficult to keep reading.  So much so, that about half way through the book I almost gave up and quit reading.  That being said, I am so glad that I stuck with it and finished.  The last part of the book moved along and kept my interest much more than the first part.  Toward the end I began to sympathize with Eliza and Rose, something the first part of the book failed to do for me.
B000FDVOXO|5.0|During the early 1990s when Terminator 2: Judgment Day was released on video and when I first seen it I was intrigued on how they went about making the movie tell more of the story where the first movie had left off.  There is one thing that I heard some people say is that James Cameron tried making this a family film and I have to say that no family film would go about having a 'R' rating.  Not only that what family film would have such language as the 'F' word in it, and I wonder what those people are thinking.  If there's anything I can say is if there is any in here that shows it as one I want to know, but it may have borrowed lightly of those kind of movies cause of John Connor only being a child in the movie.  Although in the last movie there was only one terminator sent back, this time two of them are sent back, take a guess which one is on what side.<br /><br />While I grew up watching the theatrical edition of the movie, after picking up this version on DVD I was surprised that I got a copy of the movie with 16 minutes more of movie and wondered what kind of extra footage was restored back into it.  Some of the extra footage did help me better understand some points of the movie so I can see how some decisions of the movie came about as it got to that point in the movie.  The bonus features of the film, also helped me understand how they went about it as it took on the use of CG which at the time wasn't all that big at the time of the making of Terminator 2.  Overall I give it 5 stars out of 5.
B004KV3PI4|5.0|I love this.  It's got such a big sound.  A few great hooks sprinkled in- just enough to make you wish for more, but instead the mood shifts into psychedelic swirls.  This is my first album from Trail of the Dead, but I liked it enough that I immediately bought Source Tags & Codes too.  Unfortunately, I just cannot get into that album.  Just seems like very ordinary indie-rock.  But Tao... Simply rocks.  Big, epic, enveloping world of sound.  I wanna live there.
B001TK80C0|2.0|With James Cameron doing writing and directing of the first two Terminator movies, I was hoping that he'd have a part of the third movie like usual.  Though I have heard he wanted to but wasn't going to be given full creative control of the movie then they ended up getting other people like writers and director.  I don't know which part went wrong but it seems like there are some things like in the writing that got a little messed up, due to like with the story line in some sense.  The first movie obviously took place in May 1984, then the second film took part in sometime in 1995, but according to the opening of Terminator 3, the second film took part in 1998 which would be 6 or more months after Judgment Day had occurred.<br /><br />It was interesting to see what kind of Terminator that they would try to come up with for this movie and even though that it was a female that played the new one called the 'Termatrix' or 'T-X' for short.  Some of the stuff I think was nice on paper but the execution of it could've been better in the end along with maybe the writing could've been better as well.  While watching the movie it, to me it seems like it don't have that 'Terminator' feeling to it like the other movies had and I think the crew that worked on the movie should've understood the mythology of the movie franchise better maybe this movie could've been better.  Overall I give it 2.5 stars out of 5.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, I was disappointed when it ended. The characters were extremely well written and I was thoroughly engrossed, particularly with her adoptive parents.  When she first arrived, I had my doubts about Rosa, but came quickly to love both her and Hans.  It's rare that I get emotionally attached to characters in a book, but this book made me feel like they were part of my own family and I think it will stick with me for years to come.  The fact that there was such a strong connection with the characters make this a 5 star novel in my book and I don't give 5 stars often.    There were a couple of characters that I really couldn't see how they tied into the story line except by being Hitler supporters, but I could have missed some stuff by reading too quickly because I had such a need to see what happened next.    Highly recommended, an easy but engrossing read!
B002GJT4Y6|5.0|This second instalment of harry potter is awesome. this movie is great. What else can i say that the harry potter movies are great.
B000XUBFE2|1.0|This is not a review of the book, which is good, but of the Kindle adaptation. It is a disgrace! The illustrations are impossible to read and also impossible to enlarge. The huge number of typographical errors, in both English and German, drives one crazy. Normally, with such faulty products, one can take them back to the retailer and either get a corrected replacement, a credit, or a refund. This is unfortunately not possible with Kindle. That's why I say that this Kindle adaptation is a scam!
0061726826|4.0|Deliria amor nervosa, also known as love, used to be revered by mankind and embraced. It was something to be proud of, something to attain. Now, deliria is eradicated from citizens as soon as safely possible: shortly after the eighteenth birthday. This devastating disease can be harmful both if you have it and if you don't. Anything that can promote this disease is removed and considered harmful. Lena can't wait until her procedure in just over three months. Her mother was incurable and chose to kill herself after her husband died instead of enduring the procedure again and again to rid herself of the love she feels. Lena feels she is always under scrutiny because of her mother's choices and wants to be just like everyone else. Everyone her age undergoes an evaluation to match you with a partner to get married and have children. On the day of her evaluation, Invalids, people who want to live with love, release cows into the building and she catches a glimpse of an attractive boy who laughs at the situation. He is cured, so it's safe to be around him, but Lena starts to change as she spends time with him. Is she falling in love so close to her procedure? Is she turning out just like her mother? Does she even care anymore?    The restrictive, dystopian world that Lauren Oliver creates in Delirium just draws me in. I love dystopian fiction in general and I felt that it was influenced by some of my favorite works as Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, 1984 by George Orwell, We by Yevgeny Zamyatin, and the films Gattaca and Equilibrium. There were elements from all of these and more and I think it would be a good introduction for teens to dystopian fiction because it focuses more on the romance between the two teens. The concept is really what interested me in the first place. Love viewed as a disease flies in the face of pretty much everything I believe in. I do wish that there was more of a history attached to it. For something so drastic to happen, there had to be a reason, like nuclear war. I would also liked to have seen how the rest of the world is faring since the US closed its borders and if any other country has prescribed to their type of thinking. Maybe we will learn more about it in the next books in the trilogy, but I'm satisfied to wait for now.    One of the most intriguing things to me was the excerpts of the various bits of propaganda that appeared above each chapter header. Their condemnation of everything love related extended to all literature that was allowed to the citizens. The Bible and their fairy tales were infused and slanted with propaganda to brainwash the citizens from youth. Other familiar works of literature are made to mean completely different than we've experienced. For example, Romeo and Juliet is still mandatory reading in high school, but it's presented as a cautionary tale of the dangers of love. The Telltale Heart by Edgar Allan Poe is now a didactic work about the consequences of civil disobedience. Every society does this type of thing, admittedly more subtly, to one extent or another. Even the Brothers Grimm changed the fairy tales they compiled to suit their Protestant and bourgeoisie sensibilities. I found this to be the thing that drew me in the most because I see it happening every day. On a side note, I really hate the name of the Book if Shhh, that is referenced many times as a big source of propaganda. I think it's ridiculous.    I liked and related to Lena. She wasn't the most kickass heroine ever, but she was no delicate flower either. Her transformation from robotic automaton to love-addled rebel was believable, partly because her mother expressed her love for her children from a very young age. I think Lena really didn't ever feel comfortable in the restrictive society and the change back to how she felt when she was younger wasn't a huge stretch of the imagination. At the beginning, she was very sheltered and actually kind of boring, but once she embraced the deliria, her personality and inner fire really shined through.    I really enjoyed reading Delirium. There were a few parts in the novel that felt like there were holes and maybe a little less believable that her family wouldn't notice that she was doing forbidden things when the evidence was pretty obvious. However, the writing was excellent and the proved to be merely minor annoyances within a stellar story. The ending of the novel was powerful and I can't wait to read the next in the series.

B0010X8NF0|4.0|The Darjeeling Limited is a odd, yet pretty enjoyable movie. I'll admit it is not for everybody and has a very specific type of humor to it. Many will find it boring, but I didn't mind it. Also, I'm not very well-known of Wes Anderson's films just yet other than Fantastic Mr. Fox, which I enjoyed and thought was also a little odd and dry but overall pretty neatly done. I can see his resemblences throughout both films and can imagine his others are similar as well. I laughed out loud quite a few good times especially at Jason Schwartzman's character, Jack.  I felt all the brothers (Brody, Wilson, & Schwartzman) were well cast and each brought their own humor to the movie. The overall basis of the film is these three brothers whom no longer act like brothers riding on the Darjeeling Express Train through India to see their mother who is in the Himilayas. They encounter a few obstacles in the way, but manage to also find themselves and reconnect as brothers through their \\"spiritual\\" journey.<br /><br />The Darjeeling Limited is a Pt. 2 of Wes Anderson's film in a whole. The Pt. 1 is \\"Hotel Chevalier\\" which is a 13 minute short film about Jack's character in France before he got on the Darjeeling Express. This short film introduces Natalie Portman's character which can be seen briefly in the actual movie. The Short film, which should be watched before the actual movie, indeed offers more to the movie rather than watching the movie alone. Again, its odd in general, but I quickly realized this is a different film. Different is nice sometimes...I'd recommend giving it a watch. I hope I've been helpful.<br /><br />-Cam
B004I2K4DY|5.0|While I'd love to see a DVD of this incredible show with a little more staging, this cast makes up for it out of sheer talent--with one exception.  Yes, it's the much misaligned Nick Jonas.  I felt sorry for him at times;   he is so out of his league among these other performers.  Whose idea was this?  Thank god it wasn't Justin Bieber (he might have made a good Cosette).  This aside, get this one.   It'll make the hair on your head stand, and yes, the Encore/Finale is awesome!
142311339X|5.0|I originally read a sample of this book because it appeared on my new E-reader I received for Christmas.  I thought what the hec, I'll get the book, it sounds fun.  I ended up enjoying the adventures and it even stretched my memory from 7th grade Language Arts when we studied the Greek/Roman Mythology.  I'm a 40 something year old Mother of a 13 year old boy.  He is always needing a book to read for school so I encouraged him to get interested, so I ordered the book for him from Amazon and he couldn't put the book down.  He loved it!  I was thrilled to see him reading instead of being stuck in our basement playing the X-Box Live!!<br /><br />I do encourage parents and early teens to pick up this book, and also read other Percy Jackson books by the same author.  Total reading pleasure!
B0017WCG48|1.0|I won't bother reviewing Master of Puppets - the album, that's been done a thousand times before and I've got nothing new to add. If I were to review the music, I would have given it a five star rating. This review is only concerned with the product at hand, this Deluxe 2 LP edition.    I've done real, side by side comparisons between this, a 1989 cd version and an 80's lp picture disc, recorded on a computer and normalized to the same volume level. And straigh away, at the acoustic guitar intro on Battery, I could tell something is terribly wrong with this edition. The first thing I noticed is the obvious lack of treble. When the electric guitar, bass guitar and drums kick in it gets even worse. I'm not a professional, so I don't know the correct jargon, but it just sounds muffled, bloated and wrong. When comparing the waveforms of the recordings I made of the three different editions, it's immediately apparent what they have done with this edition. It's called compression, and as is in vogue these days, they've overdone it quite badly. It's very sad because this is a classic most deserving of a proper deluxe vinyl edition, especially since the older versions I compared with have an audible hiss, but that's insignificant next to what this edition sounds like. For all I know that hiss might not be removed without losing something with it, maybe we'll never see a better sounding version than the early ones.   There is one positive side of this edition though, the packaging and print is of high quality. It looks absolutely awesome. Almost worth a star. Too bad it fails in the most important respect, the sound quality.    If you come across a pre-1990 MoP cd or vinyl, go for it, but give this edition a wide berth.    The deluxe vinyl editions of Ride the Lightning and ...And Justice For All are also badly compressed, but MoP is by far the worst sounding of these three.
B003U0I9U0|5.0|What to say about A-ha's final contribution to the music industry, apart from it's timeless? As proven by their 25 year tenure, A-ha are more than just pretty faces. The range of Mortens vocals is astounding, whether it be 25 years ago with Take On Me, or tracks taken from the Foot Of The Mountain or Analogue, his pitch is perfect. If, like me, you have everything they've recorded together on multiple discs, this will be a fantastic addition to your collection. A massive shame that the band never 'made it big' in the US, but the rest of the world sure wasn't wrong. I can assure you, it will be a long time before either disc is taken out of the cd player in my car!
B0034G4P7G|4.0|The essence of Facebook as described in this movie is aloneness.From its creator Mark Zuckerberg who is miserably incapable of real human relationships and whose autistic mind runs on feelings of extravagant kickback from feelings of revenge and exclusion,like a chess genius his brain takes off,it multiplies his power base,by inventing a system where virtual reality,of making friends,of eviscerating people's private selves and turning them into public property,empties this generation of its humanity.Alienation and loneliness fuel Mark's ambition. He gets fame and money,billions,but has no friends.     This film is remarkable in its ability to take the multi-faced apparition of the truth as evinced in its game-changing opening scene of fast rat-a-tat dialogue between Mark and his his soon-to-be ex-girlfriend(did she ever really exist?) and in the Rashomon-like depositions for the 2 different lawsuits intercut and a segway leap into the past to tell the story from different viewpoints.Did this in fact happen or do we get one viewpoint-that the character of Zuckerberg stole the idea from the `Winklevi' brothers and abused his friendship to get money for his venture and find someone better at raising capital?The script is 1st rate with needle-sharp dialogue.     As a sociopath he has no emotional connection with others,no empathy,totally self -centred in focus,finding an idea and not letting it go until its completed.If he feels people are holding him back or not going fast enough he'll dump them without a 2nd thought.He is difficult to connect with,is far from likeable,proves himself a \\"prize*hole\\",but by the end of the film there's a certain sympathy for him as a focussed personality,who's been taken for a bit of a ride,even if he's culpable for a lot of the hurt and betrayal(his `speeding ticket').We feel a slight ache for this non-partying,ascetic loner,pursuing his own ideas.He envies Eduardo's ability to get into clubs.     The Armie Hammer double role as the Winklevoss twins is both a technical feat and great performance and a great character.The best performance(and the emotional heart of the movie) came from Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin playing a frustrated character,who's out of his depth,but fighting to do as much as he could,outraged when the person he had invested in financially and believed to be his friend,took everything away from him and walked away. We connect with this character,the under-dog trying to keep up,betrayed by the man who sold humanity for success.     Justin Timberlake delivers a strong performance as the Napster founder who totally mesmerizes Zuckerberg like Mephistopheles,with a roguish,sleezy charm.You dislke him but you also pity him.Helping along the marketing by dropping \\"The\\"from\\" Facebook\\",and saying \\" You know what's cool?A billion dollars\\".He's phenomenal,taking Facebook to the next level,leaving Eduardo behind as roadkill.Sorkin and Fincher pull off a heist of a movie,which does not skimp on complexity and sympathy,lacing their scathing telling with an underlying sadness and pity for what might have been and what was lost.A final image of Mark requesting his ex become his `friend',like a generation of users,pretending not to be alone.A superb film,thought provoking and engaging,grabbing hold of you and running.
B00127RAJY|5.0|OK, I never review but I need to start with this one.  I used to be toned and slim, a size 2 and around 120 lbs.  I got a little lazy and allowed myself to get to a size 4/6 and now Im about 130. I started working out eating right, but my metabolism just wasnt what it used to and I was NOT noticing a difference!  Ive never cared about the weight on the scale, just as long as I can fit into my size 26 jeans (now a 29)<br /><br />Ive been using this DVD for 10 days, and I already notice a huge difference.  My face is slimmer, my body is toning up.  And the best part is that you only work out for 20 min.  Ive put in hours at the gym, and now Im wondering what I could have been doing wrong that whole time to not slim down at all.<br /><br />I will admit, sometimes I do 2 levels a day, for speedier results (so 40  min), but Ive lost 3 lbs in less than 2 weeks, but more importantly I notice a huge difference in how my clothes fit.<br /><br />The motivating factor is that you really see results so quickly.<br /><br />Ive been recommending this DVD to anyone who will listen to me, great stuff!
B003PIUBZS|4.0|For fear of spoiling surprises for those who have not seen this, I will keep my review short.  I love this series even though I never thought I would.  I am giving it only 4 stars because I wish there did not have to be so much blood and guts. But the story line, and the love story are worth watching.  Once you start watching the series, you will want to watch the entire season.  You can't put it down.
0061998494|3.0|I enjoy Craig Ferguson's show and his sense of humor, so as I started reading American On Purpose I was pleased to find that it was funny but at the same time insightful and inspiring. It seemed like there was a bigger message in there about addiction, America, and life in general, and it reminded me of a combination of Bill Bryson's understated humor and Alan Alda's insightfulness.<br /><br />At least that's what the first 1/4 of the book was like. After that, things unfortunately went downhill as it became what I thought was a rather dull recitation of practically every thing that ever happened to Mr. Ferguson. The humor of the first 1/4 of the book - which had me laughing to myself frequently and even out loud a few times - basically disappeared. The reader learns about every famous person he met, every woman he slept with, and every audition and job he had. And while that might make sense if it all came together into some kind of coherent message, it never did. Mr. Ferguson briefly and timidly dips his toe into a broader meaning or lesson toward the end of the book, but it doesn't amount to much of anything. I found that, by the end, I really didn't care about his story because he never made me feel sympathetic toward or inspired by him. Which is a shame, because I think the material is there for a much more effective and powerful story. He just didn't seem to know how to tell that story.<br /><br />It also got old hearing Mr. Ferguson complain about how practically everyone in the entertainment industry other than himself is a complete idiot, and that everyone who meddled in any way with his vision of a character, a film, etc was a misguided fool. I actually started to dislike him after seeing that side of his personality. Even his later attempts at humor came off frequently as cruel instead of funny. And the self-deprecating humor - which I usually love - often seemed more like a disingenuous attempt to deflect attention away from his criticism of others.<br /><br />On another note, Mr. Ferguson's constant use of run-on sentences by placing commas where there should have been periods or the occasional semicolon was downright aggravating. How did such poor syntax get past the editors? There are literally hundreds upon hundreds of this throughout the book, and it didn't take long before it got quite annoying.<br /><br />So I guess I'm in the minority when I say this book didn't do much for me. I certainly began reading it with an eager and open mind, but I thought Mr. Ferguson fell flat, and in the end I was disappointed with it. It's a fairly quick and easy read though, so even if you agree with me you will not have invested a lot of time in it. And if, like most of the reviewers here, you like it a lot, that's great. I'm not trying to argue with anyone who disagrees with me; I just want to put my thoughts out there so people can decide for themselves whether they want to read it too.Mr. Ferguson's constant use of run-on sentences by placing commas where there should have been periods or the occasional semicolon was downright aggravating.

B000093BDX|5.0|(Note: This review has been edited; that's why it mentions a CD that hadn't been released as of the date given for the review.)  Every time that another Beach Boys best-of comes out, there are always those critics who say that the world doesn't need yet another one, and that the latest one is merely a \\"cash-in\\" or a \\"money grab.\\" Granted, there have been zillions of BB best-of's over the years (starting in the '60s), so the bashers are correct about the world having been flooded with them. And, a great many of those releases are pretty much worthless --- like all the ones that have had only nine or ten tracks or so. Other ones were (and are) more worthy. Of the single-CD collections that have been put out (some of them reissues of compilations originally released on vinyl), there have been some good ones, some of them better than others, but Sounds Of Summer just may be the best one ever released. It's certainly the best one out there right now (that I know of, anyway), despite the fact that it focuses almost entirely on the group's '60s material.  It has a whopping 30 tracks, which I think is the most I've ever seen on a single-disc BB compilation. Unlike most other one-CD comps, it includes most of the group's many, many (Top 40) hits; in fact, this CD is ALL hits! By my count, only four of them are missing: \\"Little Saint Nick,\\" \\"The Little Girl I Once Knew,\\" \\"It's OK,\\" and the \\"Beach Boys Medley.\\" (It could be argued that \\"Caroline, No,\\" which went to #32, is also missing, but it was technically a Brian Wilson solo single, not a \\"Beach Boys\\" record.)  The sound quality is excellent, even the sound on the mono tracks, and there are even couple \\"new\\" stereo mixes to boot.  About the only thing I don't like about this CD is that it doesn't include \\"California Dreamin.'\\"  Although I have several other single-CD BB best-of's that I've obtained over the years, I don't listen to them very often anymore, the reason being that I think this one is SO much better overall. (A \\"new\\" Greatest Hits CD was released in 2012, but it only has 20 tracks.)  If you're not so much interested in the group's post-'60s material as the stuff they did during the '60s, then I would say this is the only Beach Boys collection you really need. Ignore that stuff you may read or hear about this being just a money grab; it's TRULY worth it (as far as I'M concerned, anyway)!

B000KJU182|5.0|sometimes i forget they used to make films like this; i.e., great stories, with real substance.     great acting all around. Ustinov does (did) it all.    another strange anomaly in an Amazon movie description: the actor playing the title role (Terence Stamp) is not mentioned under \\"cast\\".
0143039504|5.0|This edition is pure Jane Austen. Once you are past the introduction, there are no footnotes, no annotations, no nothing, except the magnificent expanse of the author's words. There is nothing to take you out of the worlds she creates. Occasionally I couldn't live without an explanation of a word or phrase, but there is plenty of help online-- Austen sites with glossaries, etc. The physical book itself is beautiful. Satin cover surface, with image of layers of delicate Regency papers. No matter where you are in the book, you can set it down on its spine and it lays open without stress. The whole look and feel of it is like the quality of Austen's writing-- gracious, relaxed, and whole.
0143112724|5.0|Still very excellent. The pictures are a great plus, and the price is very reasonable. Any English anything must have this little gem. By far, The Elements of Style is still my favorite little manual.

0670022411|5.0|This book is not your average witch/vampire type book. There are lots of historical details and facts. One thing that struck me was the description of various items from the distant past that Matthew owns, and Diana's reaction to them. Imagine picking up a book that was written by Plato, or a dagger used in the time of Jesus. Her descriptions really made me feel the awe. In contrast to another reviewer, I absolutely loved the descriptions of the house adding rooms, spitting things out of the woodwork, etc. It let a humorous note that left me chuckling. And all the time I was reading this book, I could see the movie that could be made from it. Nothing as 'Hollywood' as the Twilight movies, but a great movie. Yes, there are some slow areas in the book, but for me they couldn't detract seriously from the overall enjoyment. And I can't wait for the sequel!!!
B001P9EQH8|3.0|Received it today and tried it with my Sennheiser HD595 headphones; the volume surely increased by a decent amount, while the sound quality is pretty much the same.  Tried it with my Ultimate Ears Triplefi earphones and same case.  In conclusion, this thing is decent for increasing the volume, which my Senn HD595 really needed because none of my MP3 players have enough power to power them; this thing gives adequate power, but I still wish for more.  Moreover, I think $22 is kind of high for just a \\"volume increaser\\".  10 bucks and I'd be much happier.  Revised:  After 11 months of use, it has stopped sending sound to the left ear.  I wonder if there is any kind of warranty for it.
0060558121|5.0|I have only ever read one other adult book ( I don't count Coraline) by Gaiman, which was vastly different from this book in both style and mood - Stardust. A friend recommended I read this book many years ago since I like mythology. I found this book really had not much to do with mythology in the classic sense. Instead the characters that were pulled from mythology, such as Odin, Anansi, Horus, Bast, and Ganesha, among others, behaved like has-been D-list celebrities that struggle to survive in a country that is repeatedly described as \\"...a bad land for gods.\\" The powers they rarely put on display were minimal and amounted to the same kind of \\"magic\\" as a skilled pick-pocket, con-artist, or amateur magician. The few times any real power is observed is once during the sexual scene of a re-invented Queen of Sheba (I'll spare you the R-rated details) and when the gods travel \\"behind the scenes,\\" a state of existence that only the gods can enter.<br />While the names of classical mythology fit into the category of the Old Gods, there are New Gods that have taken root in America, born from cultural obsessions that have evolved and devolved over the years, such as railroads - a man dressed as a railroad conductor, television - a voice talking through Lucille Ball on a rerun of I Love Lucy, vehicles - stocky men that seemed to resemble vehicles themselves, and internet - a short, nerdy, nervous kid, among other American fixations and stereotypes.<br />In addition, one of the scenic devices used throughout the plot is what Gaiman's characters describe as places of power - side-of-the-road dives that road-trippers visit for no apparent reason, such as a place boasting the largest doll collection in America or the biggest wheel of cheese. And no, Disneyworld is not one of them.<br />One of the things I found interesting about this Gaiman-born world is that the Old Gods only exist in the New World when regular people travel from other countries and bring their memories and practices with them, even when they don't intend to stay themselves. The gods are \\"born\\" from these average people, and even though they can be killed by others, they don't die otherwise, but instead alternately starve or thrive based on the behavior of the people who live and die in the New World. They all have counterpart manifestations of themselves in the countries they are pulled from, but one's existence does not affect the other - though they do seem to be aware of each other.<br />All of this is merely the background of the main plot, which centers around the activities and travels of a seemingly mortal man with a single name, Shadow. I never did \\"get\\" the one-name thing, but whatever. Through Shadow's narration, the reader learns of an impending storm - a battle between the Old Gods and New Gods, the former fighting for survival and the latter fighting for dominance. Shadow works for a mysterious \\"Mr. Wednesday\\" and is randomly haunted by his dead wife, Laura, but otherwise seems to have little drive of his own for most of the book. In fitting irony, he has his own brand of \\"magic\\" - an obsession for coin tricks to pass the time from his days spent in prison - which I could never really follow the descriptions of.<br />To be completely honest, I truly did enjoy this book, though I am struggling to say exactly why. Perhaps I was fascinated by the \\"shadowy\\" way that Gaiman told the story, or how he developed this over-the-hill world of gods and goddesses that better resembled America's middle and poor classes' struggles for survival, money, and influence. Some of the personal touches that Shadow's character added to the plot made him at times surprisingly endearing. In addition, the way that Shadow seemed to address the reader at the very end of the book was so satisfying that I laughed out loud and had to read it again several times. Something about that just brought the book to life for me and help me to fully appreciate the versatile style of Gaiman. Thisis one of those books you don't have to fully understand to fully appreciate.s you don't have to fully understand to fully appreciate.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I had never heard of Adele before this past month. I heard her single, 'Rolling In The Deep.' and instantly fell in love. After hearing 'Rolling In The Deep' and 'Someone Like You', I decided I had to buy '21' to see what this artist is truly about... And boy I wasn't disappointed! Adele's powerful self-written lyrics and deep soulful voice are enough to take you away into a place full of emotions and no pain. This album is truly the most beautiful album I have heard in my life, and will without doubt be winning lots of awards in 2011/2012. I definitely expect a 2012 Grammy nomination for album of the year. I look forward to see what Adele will become in the future, as she's such a beautiful powerhouse at the young age of 21. I love you Adele :)
1439177783|5.0|This is a very detailed and accurate account of what it is like to be anorexic and bulimic. I should know--I had those eating disorders myself between the ages of 15 and 25. The difference is that Australian born Amanda Rogers, aka Portia De Rossi, becomes bulimic before anorexic. (Usually it is in reverse order, as the starving anorexic becomes so hungry she begins binging.) She details her youth as a model struggling to get thin and only able to maintain an acceptable weight by purging via vomiting and laxatives. Not recommended, as people have even died from a torn esophagus! Later she proudly becomes anorexic, fully in control of her caloric intake.<br /><br />Reading this brought back memories, as those with eating disorders have the same mindset: an inner critic and brutal taskmaster that demands perfection, obsesses about every calorie, and requires several hours of exercise every day. Anorexics typically weigh all their food, consume the same low calorie foods every day, and eat with chopsticks to savor the food longer. We are taken on a journey that includes the thoughts held by Portia during this illness, often demonstrating arrogance: \\"I was the only one in the gym on Christmas morning, as I was the only one who took health and fitness seriously.\\" Having mastered her eating habits (and even getting down to 300 calories a day and 82 pounds!) she felt smug and superior to everyone.<br /><br />But underneath all the pride was a self loathing, a lack of self esteem, as shown by her self-condemning thoughts such as \\"You lazy fat pig.\\" On top of everything, she was a closet lesbian, afraid to come out because it could mean losing her career as a model for L'Or&eacute;al  shampoo and an actress on the Ally McBeal TV show.<br /><br />Denial is also a steady characteristic of eating disorders. Even when she was so thin that her veins on her skinny arms stuck out, \\"looking like thick strands of rope attaching my hands to my forearms and elbows,\\" she nonetheless focused on the inch of fat she had on her thighs. Even after confrontations from her family, she couldn't believe anything was wrong with her, and wrote: \\"I had always been secretly in awe of anorexics with their super-human self-restraint...Apart from the fact that I could never be thin enough to be anorexic, I didn't want to be anorexic anyway. I just wanted to excel at dieting.\\" So, even at 82 pounds, her thinnest, she didn't view herself as anorexic, but simply someone who excelled at dieting.<br /><br />The book does a great job of showing the tremendous fear anorexics have of eating. Eating just a couple of potatoes with her family on Christmas made her hysterical enough to start jumping around during the dinner in order to burn the calories! The logic of an anorexic is that it isn't just those potatoes, it's the fear of losing control, and then regaining the lost weight, and getting fat. I can relate as it happened to me! Once I gave in to just a little food which was over my carefully calculated caloric intake, I gained 60 pounds in a couple of months. The desire for food builds up in a starving body to the point that when the damn bursts, there is no longer any self control. And self control is the crowning glory of the anorexic.<br /><br />The back of the book has several photos. While Portia looks very cute and beautiful as a slender young woman with long legs, perhaps a bit fashionably underweight, there is one photo that is sure to make you gasp.  It must have been taken when she weighed in the 80s.<br /><br />But the story does have a happy ending, as the author is now  healed and married to the famously out-ed lesbian Ellen DeGeneres.had on her thighs.

1936594293|5.0|Anyone who has read Jane Austen before knows that she's a fantastic author.  She makes the words \\"good book\\" into flesh and blood.  This is prime Jane Austen, complete with dry humor and convoluted relationships.  The book itself is ok.  I bought it from Amazon because I was close to the $25 free shipping rate.  But a used Pride and Prejudice anywhere would be fine, as the gems are inside the book, and reading them is the whole point.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I love Adele's voice and actually pre-ordered this album after hearing 5-6 songs from Youtube after the album was released in Europe and someone had uploaded them for a brief time before they were taken down.  To be honest I would have pre-ordered only based on hearing \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" as a single and her live performance of \\"Someone Like You\\" on \\"Later live with Jools Holland\\" which is on Youtube. Here's a link if they don't erase it: [...] .   Here's where the \\"but\\" comes... Unfortunately the version of \\"Someone Like You\\" on the album does not come close to the live version I mentioned...and that was one of my 3 favorite songs and a big reason why I got the album in the first place. Basically she sings the chorus differently by doing sort of a \\"whiny\\" falsetto voice when she says \\"Don't forget me I beg I'll remember you said\\".  That change and the overall hollow sounding version of the song sort of ruined my perfect day after receiving the album... :( I really hope they will release the live version of the song so I can by that as well and replace this one with it.  Besides that the album is near perfect with 3 songs being just OK (#5,6,8) and the rest being great.  She also experiments with differents styles like country (#4 - i love this song! the next single!), gospel/soul (#7,9), dancy (#5), motown-ish sounding (#2) and R&B (#6). Then there is the Cure cover, which I happen to like better than the Cure's version because there is more feeling and sincerity in hers.  Overall I'd definitely recommend this album.  I own her first album - 19, which is more acoustic, but also great if you like this album.  Now everyone should go and request a live version of \\"Someone Like You\\" if there isn't one yet.  I haven't checked, but I will do so now.

0679805273|5.0|I didn't receive this book upon graduation or success, or during any sort of right of passage moment. This book was read to me when I was on the verge of suicide. My depression had put blinders on me, and I could see it in the distance as a warm, easy option that I could take and no one would be mad or disappointed, or at least not so's I'd notice. Then my friend read this book to me.<br /><br />At first I rolled my eyes. \\"Why congratulate? Today ISN'T my day. Today is garbage.\\" It continued on about how well I would do and all the nifty things I'll accomplish, and how I would continuously meet with success.<br /><br />Except when I don't. Because sometimes, I won't.<br /><br />She read about confusion and horror. She read about being in a slump, about having to wait, about being alone and how it makes you see things that scare you.

B003UESJH4|5.0|I just saw The King's Speech. I had the whole theater to myself.<br /><br />This movie is spectacular!<br /><br />Until now, the most prominent British personality I could think of during World War II would have been Winston Churchill. Little did I know that behind that blubbering shadow stood a man who fought a far greater battle than even fighting Hitler: Public Speaking. As King, Albert Frederick Arthur George, or King George VI (played by Collin Firth), stammered most of his life and had become a reluctant King upon the abdication of the throne by his elder brother, Edward VIII. As King, George VI's stutter caused problems, especially in carrying out the only real duty of a monarch in a country that revolutionized finance and industrialization. But when World War II broke out and the King was called to duty to galvanize his nation by speaking to his subjects, he found friendship and rehabilitation by an Australian speech therapist named Lionel Logue (played masterfully by Geoffrey Rush.)<br /><br />Firth and Rush both deserve Oscars for their performances; best actor and best supporting actor, respectively.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I love my box set because I love the Beatles. It is so wonderful having all their cds and music in one compact box. The music is great and clear. My father was jealous that I got it. He was also the reason I loved the Beatles so much. He also enjoyed the sound.
B000NQ19QA|5.0|I was pleased with my order. It came sooner than said and was in great condition. I would definitely order from this seller again.
B0000024W3|5.0|OK - maybe way back in 1970 - the year that a 40-year-old yours truly was born - this was sacrelige. But apart from initial reaction, over time and now this is a beautiful, melodic, 'GO F YOURSELF' to the insane groupies, folk barons, and just about everyone listening at the time. But that was then, and this is now, and this is a beautiful 'Physical Graffiti-esque' album outlived its critics.    First song - meh. But second song Alberta is awesome. And the assorted covers are great, which one has to admit - were beautiful songs. The much criticized 'Boxer' cover may have seemed trite at the time, but looking back you can see the two voices of Dylan - the country crooner and the Disaffected Village resident - singing in tandem. This, if anything, is a high point. Compare/Contrast. And it might not seem pretty, but in an anarchic way it just works.
B004A8ZX28|4.0|While on a business trip in Berlin with his wife Elizabeth (January Jones), Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) gets into a bad car accident. Martin wakes up in a hospital and is told he was in a four day coma and suffering memory loss. All he can remember is that his wife was in Berlin with him  before the car accident and that she must be worried. After awhile he remembers what motel they were staying at and rushes to find her. When he catches up with Elizabeth, she claims she has no idea who he is. In fact she is with a man who claims he is the real Dr. Harris.<br />  Martin now has to convince the authorities and himself that he's not crazy and that he is the real Martin Harris. Ernst Jurgen, a retired German spy (Bruno Ganz) and Gina (Diane Kruger), a taxi driver who's in Berlin illegally are the only people who seem to believe him. This puts them in danger when men wielding guns are after Martin.<br />  Unknown is excitingly fast paced and puts the viewers on the edge of their seat. While Liam Neeson is as good as Mel Gibson (Edge of Darkness) at playing a part where he's not only looking for answers, but revenge as well. Kind of like in Darkman, Taken and even the A-Team lol. All in all, Unknown is a fun mind bending thriller that is worth checking out.

0811826848|5.0|This book is THE story, the ONLY one to listen to. No reading from embittered sycophants, or random encounters~NO, \\"this is the Beatles story in their own words & pictures\\". As it says on the cover, and it truly means it. What a treasure for lifelong fans & what a revelation for naysayers & those that believed the bull put out on them. You get steeped in the life of those years, it was wonderful to read & re-read~the quality of the entire production of the book is stellar. People who want to repeat untenable memes about the Beatles & their story, breakup etc.. should be forced to read this.

0817439390|3.0|I would rank my skills as an intermediate amateur currently.  I bought this book with the expectation, in part derived from all the 5 star reviews, that it would give me a much deeper understanding of exposure.  I was somewhat disappointed with this book for several reasons.    The organization and flow of the subject matter are just wrong.  For example, on page 14 the author has a section named \\"Setting & Using Your Camera on Manual Exposure\\".     In this section he then states, \\"If you're unsure of how to set your camera to manual exposure mode, read the manual!\\". What, are you serious Mr. Peterson? Look at the title of your section.      He then states, \\"...adjust your shutter speed until the camera's light meter indicates a 'correct' exposure in your viewfinder and take the photograph. You've just made a manual correct exposure!\\"  First off you are implicitly acknowledging your audience is one of a beginner here. They won't know what the \\"exposure meter\\" is or, MORE IMPORTANTLY, what exactly is the \\"correct\\" exposure.  If you wait it comes later, rather than before, on page 23.  But hold the presses folks! In looking at the diagrams, meant to represent the image of your viewfinder, they are just plain wrong. The red text in the diagrams does NOT indicate what the viewfinder is indicating in 3 of the 4 diagrams.  This sort of gross error is inexcusable and will lead an amateur astray for sure.     On page 46 the author describes \\"Story Telling\\" Apertures.  There are two photos which look very different in terms of focus and depth of field on page 46 & 47.  Yet the author's caption reads \\"Both photos: 2-35mm lens at 20mm, f/22 for 1/30 sec\\".  These are clearly NOT the same so the reader is left wondering what is being conveyed here.    Often when the author is making a point about certain subject matter he will show a photograph demonstrating his intent and correct composition.  It would be immensely helpful to an amateur if he showed an INcorrect version alongside so readers could compare and contrast.      Also some photos of a camera (alternate between the two brands most popular: Nikon & Canon) at the beginning of the book (say page 16), when you are talking about setting a certain functions on the camera would be very helpful in orienting beginners and illustrating what you are referring to.     The book is short on words and actual unique, insightful comments (the few are repeated often). It lacks coherence in terms of putting all aspects of \\"exposure\\" together: namely available and type of light, aperture, shutter speed and ISO.  After reading more than half of this book I came away with very little more knowledge.      This book does offer some redeeming qualities.  The biggest one for me was seeing the compositions, some very striking and intriguing, offering readers the perspective to be gained from knowing how to approach composing and capturing some of there own stunning photographs.     If you have your camera manual and it is written somewhat decent along with another one or two books on exposure then this book may be a worthy addition to your understanding. If you hope to use it as your sole source of understanding exposure, in my estimation, this will be difficult at best.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|I found this book to hold my interest and sometimes I found it hard to put down.  By the end of the book, though, I was ready to move on to another book.      I appreciated the flavor of India that was woven throughout the book.  It was interesting to read about a culture so different from ours in regards to the value of life, whether it be a child, a woman, or an older person.      The story is told through the different characters, and I thought this approach worked well with this story.  The author was able to show how each character viewed a particular part of the story, and I found myself able to understand why the different characters felt the way they did.     I think the story felt like it was dragging at the end, and yet ended somewhat abruptly, if that makes sense.  All in all, though, I would recommend this book as a good read.

B002RSDW80|3.0|Julie & Julia is about Julie Powell who decides she'll spend a year cooking recipes in Julia Child's cookbook and blogging about it.  The movie skips between Julie's life and Julia life.  The story tries to run a parallel between  Julia (Meryl Streep) and Julie (Amy Adams).  I applaud Meryl Streep's performance.  Her portrayal was excellent.  Amy Adams didn't act badly, her character was just blah...I wished the Julie sequences would end and the Julia sequences would start.  Streep was THAT good.    I wished this movie was strictly about the life of Julia.  Instead - here's two women, they have the same dreams, they have turmoil in their lives, they both meet their goals.  But not really...comparing the life of Julia to Julie was futile.  Julie followed recipes and reported in her blog.  I'm sure it was therapeutic.  But the stretch to make their lives parallel failed.   There were scenes that lacked detail.  Julie tells everyone she has to \\"debone a duck.\\"  The actual deboning scene moves quickly.  I wanted to see more, like scenes of her practicing and screwing them up instead of a short scene where she performs flawlessly.  At the end Julie gets a call saying \\"Julia hates you.\\"  The next scene shows them visiting the Julia exhibit with Julie happily taking pictures and bringing her butter.  It's hard to believe that if you find your mentor hates you, it might take time to get back to that happy place.  This scene in the movie wasn't given the time needed.  Julie & Julia was on the long side, but the Julia half of the movie flew by.  I am hoping someone will now write a movie about Julia's life...I just hope that this movie gets written before Meryl Streep is too old to act in it.
B004MMEIK0|4.0|Characters are developed with a deft hand. Although darker elements and danger are part of the plot, the narrating voice is light and breezy, creating confidence in the reader that the story will successfully resolve itself, and the like-able main characters will elude the bad guys with little damage. The banter of the two leads works. Book is similar to the Sookie Stackhouse novels. Includes sweet male vamps who work security in their kilts.

B00280LYIC|5.0|Thi is it. This is the book that inspired my fanatical love of reading. It started in third grade, when my friend (who shall be called &#34;Jimmy&#34;) was reading this in class. Back then, reading wasn't &#34;cool&#34;, so noone did. Except of course, my good friend, &#34;Jimmy&#34;. Jimmy read all the time. He had started reading the Percy Jackson series the month before, and hd just started the second book. I asked him why he was reading, and he simply answered &#34;Because I enjoy it&#34;. That was the life-changer right there. By learning that books were enjoyable, that opened up a whole new path for me. The path to Nerd-Dom. I picked this book up a Border's, and utterly devoured it in maybe, I don't know, two weeks? I bought the next book. That one took me nine days to finish. Then I bought Harry Potter. Then Redwall. Then Artemis Fowl, and many others, ranging from well know, such as Eragon, to my personal favorite, Skulduggery Pleasant. As of today, I have a library of nearly five hundred books, not including those on Kindle, which I got for Christmas. I have heard peple say that this was a chezp Harry Potter knock-off, but I don't see it. All the similarities are actually part of something called the &#34;Rags to Riches&#34; plotline. This is commonly used throughout various types of media. &#34;Star Wars&#34; for instance is a Rags to Riches story. We meet Luke, the galactic equivalent of a poor kid. He learns he is a Jedi. Thus, that elevates him above all else. (Bearded wise man is Obi-Wan Kenobi, Smart Alec is Leia, Comedic Support are Chewbacca, and Han Solo.) See where I'm going? Now for the ups and downs of this book      Pros:  Character Development  Insertion of Greek Mytology  Description  Dialogue  Humor  Cast  Anything not on Cons list    Cons:  A tad over-the-top-quips by Percy                I am a tad biased on this review, seeing as I'm a sucker for Greek Mythology, but I would give this book an easy ten. It floats on gusts of breezy charm,and it's cast is eminently likeable. Anyone who says different is wrong. Don't let them fool you.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Odds are the info in question is in error somehow.  Either that, or whoever's deciding how this thing's being released is a complete and total idiot.    Think about it, Blu Ray is a high definition format, designed to be played on HD TVs-the vast majority of which by design have a widescreen format.  There is absolutely no reason for anyone to bother with the pan and scan process anymore, especially for a Blu Ray release.  Who can even hook up a Blu Ray player to an old boxy TV set anyway?  Why go through the expense of buying the player when you don't even have a set that can display the enhanced picture quality the new format allows for?    The only reason I can think of for them doing this is literally just to piss off fans. Another slightly more likely reason is that they may be literally \\"cutting corners\\"-it's too expensive to upconvert and remaster the entire picture (but you'd expect George Lucas of all people to be quite capable of sparing the expense).  If they're smart they'd still consider that they'll end up losing more money from a releasing a full screen-only version than they would from having to make a bit more of the picture HD.    This said, while I wish they'd include so little as a remastered standard definition version of the original original trilogy with 5.1 surround-I'm not terribly bothered by most of the Special Edition changes/additions, aside from maybe the music video bit in Jabba's Palace in RotJ.

Chirs can sing better than Plant can now anyway. The band is tight and Page simply enhances the effort. Even the Foo Fighters with Page & Jones at Wembly couldnt come close to this performance.
0670022411|5.0|I love witches, but I'm a bigger fan of vampires. Harkness writes about the supernatural like I want to read it...full of mystery, intelligence and ROMANCE. This is an amazingly smart novel full of romance, witchcraft, charming vampires and more. Buy this book and you won't be disappointed...you'll be swept away!
0439023521|5.0|I'm not sure that words can adequately express how much I enjoyed--and am still enjoying, since I've actually only finished the first 2 books while I'm waiting for the 3rd from Amazon--this series!<br /><br />Hunger Games is obviously the first book, so it is our first foray into Katniss and all her adventures. One thing I would definitely say to anyone who picks up this book--commit to finishing this book. If you don't like the first book, then you might not like the rest, but don't give up if in Part 1 of this book you are not sucked in. I wasn't. For one thing, it took me a little while to warm up to Katniss--she's a GREAT character, and I love her, but when she first came on the scene, she was a little rough around the edges and at times, a little difficult to like. She's hardened, suspicious, not precisely the 17 year old you would expect, but the more you learn about her world, the more she makes sense. Part 1 didn't impress me. Part 2 sucked me in, and by the time I got to Part 3, I couldn't even put the book down to go to bed knowing I had to work in four hours. On my lunch break, I had to buy the second book. It's one of those books. Once you get pulled in, you don't want to put it down--ever. The ONLY complaint I have about this book (other than one weird part at the end of this book, which is resolved in the 2nd book) or the series in general is that it does not go on forever.<br />The characters are great--it's so hard to decide who you like best, because you just like them all in different ways. The plot is concise, it moves along without dragging and lingering too long, so it's impossible to lose interest.<br />Whether your preferred author is Stephenie Meyer or George Orwell, there's something in this book for everybody!<br /><br />One thing: while fantastic, it isn't for very young readers. Normally when I think of YA I think safe for kids 9-12, but this one isn't; I would definitely encourage only readers maybe 14/15 (depending on the kid) or older to read this one.<br /><br />Down with the Capitol! :)Down with the Capitol! :)
0670022411|1.0|If I ever write a bad romance, I promise I won't allow it to be advertized as something other than a romance novel. Why the trickery? There are plenty of people who gobble this junk up! I want my money and the hours of my life wasted on this trash back!<br /><br />Trust me, you do not want to spend 10 minutes with any of the characters in this book, let alone the hours it will take to slog through it.<br />Our heroine is a brainiac tenured professor studying at Oxford, a serious athlete and a very independent woman who meets the great love of her life, a 1500 year old Vampire, who is, apparently, an autistic savant.<br />They meet and you spend the next several hundred pages watching their love grow as danger sort of looms, but not really. Mostly you just read a lot about her exhaustion, sleepiness and hunger. She eats a LOT. But not as much as she sleeps. And she doesn't just sleep - she gets tucked in the way a baby might. \\"Scooped\\" up by her lover and tucked in - and when she awakes, you guessed it - food! Not food you'd expect to read about, either. Eggs, toast (more toast in a day than I'd eat in a 5 year span), vegetable soup and tea. Buckets of tea. Our little genius reads every person and situation she encounters wrong - to disastrous effect. For all her studies and experience, she doesn't appear to have actually met any people in her life. Ugh - and if she did they'd loathe her.<br />Endless talk of their great love, honesty and total acceptance of each other and the importance of family.<br />Then they forget all that, lie to each other, invade each other's privacy, refuse to accept anything at all about each other and prove over and over again that they hate and mistrust their families.

B003OF3R0S|5.0|The loss of Jimmy \\"The Rev\\" Sullivan impacted not only the band's personal life, but also their art. Hitherto, Avenged Sevenfold has turned out a couple good albums, one great album, and a couple that were just mediocre. \\"Nightmare\\" definitely takes one on the 'very dark journey' that was intended. Many of the songs are, as usual, about pain and loss and death and suffering, but this time they resonate more deeply. I guarantee that the first time you hear the album all the way through, you'll be very depressed. I sure was, and didn't like it. But as I listened to it more, I grew to like it, and I've come to the conclusion that it's their best album. But, ah, the price that was paid to achieve great art!     For my part, the only song that fails to hit the mark is \\"Victim.\\" Here, it becomes a personal moment that is just too real and, as it was probably written *after* Jimmy's death, it doesn't exactly match its surroundings. Not only that, it also shows a distinct departure from the established style, and sounds like a different band.    I liked the songs \\"Nightmare\\", \\"Danger Line\\", \\"Buried Alive\\" and \\"Save Me\\" best. But too often on this album, the songs alternate between hardcore rock and ballads. That can be a good thing, as it shows contrast, light and shade. But whatever happened to \\"I'll find peace in the afterlife\\"? How did they get from \\"Dear God\\" to \\"God Hates Us\\"? Still, there is much to admire in this album, Jimmy's swan song, because the band succeeds in getting back to their hard rock roots instead of flying off in opposite directions with lighter music.       Here's the greatest (but still small) letdown: the album's artwork resembles a gaudy Halloween greeting card, the cd art is beyond ghastly, and the printed lyrics are tiny. This doesn't much affect how it sounds, but something a little less subdued would have been a boon.    This is my favourite A7X album, and I am very happy to own a brand new copy.

0316044938|4.0|I gave 'Lovely Bones' 4 stars based on the originality of concept.  If I had to grade the novel on 'execution' I would have given it no better than a '3'.  The concept of a 14 y.o. girl--having been horrifically murdured by a serial sexual psychopath--then watching the progress of her family, friends and even her killer through the years is, in my opinion, inherently fascinating.  Like the soul of a hero slain in Homer's 'Iliad', she flees the earth to an otherworld.  Unlike a Homeric hero, however, her otherworld is no dark Hades across the River Styx, but a special kind of Heaven in which, like a Greek Goddess, she can observe human events but, unlike a Goddess, she has virtually no impact on them.<br /><br />Interesting.  In my opinion, the way the author spins out the tale, however, is not particularly interesting.  The story should have been tighter and far less verbose.  I found myself, just as a do with many less than fascinating novels, trying to skim over the dull stuff to get to the real meat of the story.  The problem was that, for me at least, there was very little meat and, in some areas, the story is nonsensical.  Let me give one example.  Susie is generally believed to have been murdered and dismembered in a neighborhood cornfield.  Only weeks following the killing, two of Susie's friends and classmates decide to have a romantic trist in the same cornfield after midnight.<br /><br />Now remember, at this point in the story, no one is positive who the killer is and they certainly don't know whether or not he may have staked out the cornfield as his special hunting/killing ground.  No fourteen year old child would enter such a field after dark and probably not during daylight unless accompanied by most of the kids from their school.  Nevertheless, it happens in the story and tragedy ensues.  Ridiculous.<br /><br />Nevertheless, despite these weaknesses, the story--despite the fact that Susie is looking down from 'Heaven'--has moments of deep pathos.  To lose a child under any circumstances is tragic.  To lose a child to stoke the pleasure of a sexual psychopath is especially horrific.  The author has done a good job in trying to get inside the head of such a creature.  I'm not certain that anyone can really understand what motivates such monsters because in many ways they seem more alien to normal people than do reptiles.  Yet they exist and there must be reasons for what they do.<br /><br />One critical reviewer of this book wrote that he/she was distressed that the killer doesn't 'pay' for his crimes in a way more satisfying than a simple accident.  I agree but understand that the author wanted to show that--on Earth, at least--there may be no retribution.  Some murderers, even sexual psychopaths, do get away with it.  Still, if I had been writing the tale, I'd have had Susie tap the icicle.circumstances is tragic.  To lose a child to stoke the pleasure of a sexual psychopath is especially horrific.

B004KPQK2S|5.0|What a great story! The movie is well done. It is good clean family fun and so very inspiring. You will not be disappointed after watching this movie.
B002ZG98FU|4.0|I never have time to go to the movies these days with my busy schedule. I usually enjoy the comfort of my home and refuse to pay the ridiculus prices at the theaters. I promised my wife I would take her to the movies when \\"Morning Glory\\" came out. My wife loves Rachel McAdams, ever since she made \\"The Notebook\\". I was expecting to be bored and asleep by the first half hour. I was surprised that I was really getting into this movie. I laughed at the poor anchorman who is put through hell to boost ratings. I also found myself enjoying Harrison Ford's character. Nobody plays a better grouch then Ford. I loved Rachel McAdam's characters spunk and refusal to give up. I'm surprised by many reviewers hating that about this character. I don't understand why everyone expects dedicated workers to be  unpleasent people. I am always joking around and having a good time. I put in over 14 hours of work a day and seldom get enough sleep. I work 7 days a week sometimes. I can relate with this character. Just because you put in a ton of hours of work doesn't mean you have to be a social outcast. If you like Harrison Ford, Rachel McAdams, Diane Keaton, or any of the other actors in this film. You are going to love them in this film. It is a funny film with great actors. I would watch this movie again and knowing my wife she will probably buy the dvd when it comes out.
0307474712|2.0|Ok, some of you may hate people who post spoilers in their reviews... But I love it.  And I wish someone else had posted some spoilers on this one before I purchased it!  There were things I liked about this book... and there were things I hated!  I can certainly see the conparisons people make to When Harry Met Sally, or even Same Time Next Year.  But this is no where near as good, at least not in my opinion.  Maybe Im a silly romantic, or a soft heart.... but I like a happily ever after.  And from page one, I had it in my head I knew how the book would end.  But I was seriously wrong!  I really felt like I could relate to the main character Emma.  There were so many things in her life that I could completely relate to.  So, I was routing for her.  But she just gets totally S#!* on all through this book, while Dexter gets to live it up with no consequences.  **SPOILERS** Then in the end after Emma is there by his side through the whole book, and helps him turn his life around and find happiness.  She is finally rewarded with getting what she has always really wanted... Dexter (pathetic).  And then what happens.... happily ever after... no.  Almost immediately, Emma is killed in a freak accident and Dexter gets to go on with his life now that Emma fixed it up for him.  yes, he has to deal with losing her, which is tragic.  But at least he ges to live!  While Emma pratically sacfraficed her life for him.  Besides the totally tragic ending... which some people may love! Lots of people out there hate the Happily Ever After that I crave!  But I also couldn't stand that it seemed all the major events of both Dex and Em;s lives... happen off page.  Since we only get to see one day a year... we miss Dex's mom's death, Dex's wedding, the birth of his daughter, Dex and Em's wedding, we miss all the major events and only get tiny comments about them in following years.  This book left me depressed.

0684171600|4.0|I bought this book as a classic for my grandson.  It is a beautiful book but I had forgotten how scary it is.  The characters are wonderfully drawn and the illustrations by Wyeth are lovely.  I will have to keep until my grandson is about 12 as I do think that would be the right age for a child to read it.  As an adult, I enjoyed Stevenson's language and story!

B00004RFFS|5.0|This movie is one of the best vampire movies I have seen. It wasn't just about blood, guts, and how scary they could make the vampires. It was about the emotion a vampire feels being what they are and about how life is for them. It was a twist of all kinds of emotions. Such as, greed, lust, regret, sorrow, love, passion, and much more. This movie surprised me mainly because it was so different from what I thought it would be. Plus I had no idea how many great actors where in this film either. It was almost as good as Dracula...very close. This movie is definately worth adding to your collection of vampire films. I know I will be adding it to mine.
1400034205|2.0|I decided to read \\"Razor's Edge\\" because I picked it up at a yard sale cheaply--50 cents--and because Maugham has been touted as a must-read classic author.  Secondly, the description in the back of the book talks about Larry Darrell's sojourn after the war to find a spiritual meaning to his life.  This is what appealed to me since at the time I was going through a life crisis/search for meaning in tragedy myself and was hoping to find some answers in the book.  Unfortunately, surprisingly, this plot line is actually a very small part of the book.  Thusly, it was disappointing to find Darrell's search for enlightenment leading him ultimately to India's Brahmanism and the continuous reincarnation of the soul.  This is perhaps my least favorite spiritual philosophy on life, so the book left me feeling empty in regard to my own quest.  As other reviews have correctly pointed out--a big part of the book describes lifestyles of the main characters and people watching episodes.  It's dry and uninteresting reading. On the plus side, Maugham's style is energizing and unique.  His strength is his ability to express abstract thoughts--clearly--with the least amount of words. Elliott Templeton's character is so generous it is unbelievable--yet leaves the reader with a desire to try and do better in his own life.  Not sure why they consider this book a classic(it's in the \\"1001 books you must read before you die\\"), but now I can say I've read one of Maugham's books.

B003L45JLW|4.0|First of all, this review is based on the Blu Ray surround sound version. I'm sure that if I had the cd I would not like listening to it nearly as much. I have the two Blu Ray audio releases by Petty, this and Damn The Torpedos and they are probably the two best sounding music discs I have, even better than SACD and DVD AUDIO formats. As for the music, many Petty fans will be disappointed I guess, because this is not a typical Petty album. This is white man's blues and mostly soft blues, and not really blues, just sort of a blues-pop vibe. There are a couple of heavier cuts. This is a player's album and the band gets to jam a bit and show off. The music is pleasant and some of the songs have a old rock sound (the 2nd song First Flash of Freedom sort of sounds like a cross between the Doors and Emerson Lake And Palmer). Overall, my wife and I really enjoy listening to it, but the fact that the Blu Ray surround sound is so good really helps. I hope more musicians record in Blu Ray. I just purchased one of the Neil Young Blu Ray audios from his website, and it's excellent.
B0021L8UPS|5.0|I love this movie. I think everyone should watch it at least once. I like the unexpected twist at the end.

030746363X|4.0|This book has a lot of good tips in it. Some of the weight loss tips sound a lot like the Atkins diet to me, but that is just a small section of this book. There is a tremendous amount of other useful information here. Definitely worth a read even if you don't want to gain 64 pounds of muscle, or lose 30 pounds of fat in a month. I'm sure you will find something here that can improve your life in some way.
1599218011|5.0|I posted this to Good Reads, but I thought that more people on Amazon should know how awesome this book is too.<br /><br />Ok - so while I don't ever think that I will be a complete vegetarian, Kris Carr's book has really helped me understand why it is vital to eat REAL food and why. With many excerpts from doctors and other allied health professionals as well as natural foodies, the science really comes to life as to why incorporating these vital nutrients that we often forget into our diets.<br /><br />I have been fighting the diet struggle for years with calorie counting, carb counting, and even points counting, but this book makes it easy to understand what foods to avoid or limit and why. I think after reading this book I have a new found appreciation for eating the right foods for the right reasons, as well as taking care of myself as a woman and not always thinking that I am selfish for doing so.  (My favorite line from the book is where she talks about weight loss, it's about health.  Weight loss is just a side effect if you are out of balance.)<br /><br />It may be because as a 30 year old female, it was easy to read her writing since she is a 30 something herself and writes uninhibited as if having a conversation with you. You learn to appreciate her frank and bold expressions of her opinions but I value this and appreciate that she also expresses that not everyone will stop eating all meat or become a full fledged vegan because of her book.<br /><br />Highly recommended - even if you are not a vegetarian or a vegan or a raw foodie - but you may appreciate it even more if you are.
159562015X|5.0|My fiance and I both completed a Strengthfinder 2.0 assessment.  The results validated our strengths...as I see it in him and as he sees it in me.

I would recommend this book.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|I bought this mixer for our church where an ipod, a cd player, a laptop, and 2 mics are connected to it.  It does the job beautifully managing all those and I do not have to unplug anything to plug other device.  I prefer the slider controls, but the knobs will work.  I had to get 1/4\\" mono adapter for most of it, but those things are cheap and it standardised the inputs.  The mixer can do many times over on what I am using it for and I don't understand what half the things are there for.  This thing is so small and light - my other mixer looks like the Titanic in front of this.     The only improvement I would suggest that it have an on/off switch - I couldn't find one and I looked all over it.      Instructions - who needs instructions - that is for someone who knows what they are doing - I work trial and error and got it working in the 3rd try.     I think this product is designed very well and the price is very good.  Shipping was on target as well, so I am very pleased with this purchase.
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|Having grown up in the 80's, music for me was pretty much done after the early '90s...  the ubiquity of rap and hip-hop killed my every desire to listen to new music. Fortunately one day I stumbled onto this concert on Palladia TV, and was at first pleasantly surprised, and then completely transfixed by the energy, intensity, pure musical talent, and more than anything, the range, variety and sheer volume of quality music by a band that didn't exist until 2002.  With every song, my incredulity grew at the fact that these \\"kids\\" had so many songs that I'd never heard before, but that I thoroughly enjoyed, even the first time around.    I immediately bought the Blu-Ray DVD, and I've recommended it to many friends and relatives.  I'm amazed that The Killers aren't yet as big as U2, The Police or Queen; it's probably just a matter of time until they get there.  I'm also surprised that this isn't among the best-selling concert DVDs ever... it quickly moved to the top of my fairly large collection.    Get the Blu-Ray DVD; you'll be glad you did.
B000PHN4HE|4.0|This movie is from the mid eighties and it shows.... I had the same haircut (as Ally Sheedy) back then. And those fashions.... Yikes! Brings back all sorts of memories.

B00001OH1S|5.0|Im probably not the most reliable critic, as I don't purchase many CD's. I loved this music and very much wanted to get the music. Initially, some years ago, I intended to get this album from Amazon and read the reviews back then and every one of them panned the album and I decided to not buy it based on those reviews. Years later I again saw the movie and was intrigued enough I thought to hell with it, I going to get it anyway. One of the wisest things I have done. Remember, that like art, music is in the ear of the beholder, but this is now one of my favorite albums. I hihgly recommend it. Good luck, to you.
6304884419|5.0|This is a touching coming of age film and a great mobster flick, all rolled into one. But it can be hard to find on DVD. Allow me to provide some clarifications and recommendations.<br /><br />[[ASIN:6304884419 A Bronx Tale]] ===> This is the long out of print HBO release from 1998. With the real-life Calogero (Lillo Brancato) currently serving a 10-year sentence for armed robbery-turned-murder, it is unlikely that a major studio will market a re-release any time soon.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0033PSH4U A Bronx Tale (Amazon.com Exclusive)]] ===> This is available here on Amazon, but be advised it is an \\"on demand\\" DVD-R.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0010BFAOY A Bronx Tale [Region 2]]] ===> This is the Region 2 release. Amazon does not specify it in the Product Descriptions, but this is the Optimum release from the UK. It is excellent, and includes a \\"Making Of\\" featurette. Probably best to buy it directly from Amazon UK, as I did. (See link in Comments section below.) You will need a Region-Free DVD Player to enjoy this, but many U.S.-sold players can handle it by entering a simple code. See, for example, my review of the [[ASIN:B001TLLXCI Philips DVP5990]].<br /><br />Obviously there is no Blu-ray. However, you can still buy new copies on VHS! ([[ASIN:6303029027 Bronx Tale [VHS]]])<br /><br />Enough with the tech specs. A Bronx Tale was Chazz Palminteri's screenplay, based on his own life. It was his first major film role; he has worked consistently in Hollywood ever since. I attended Chazz's one-man show last year and he was just as powerful, alone on the stage. This film was also De Niro's directorial debut. Nice touch by Bobby D and willingness to be only the third most important role. Great, great period soundtrack.<br /><br />Sadly, the life of crime which the young on-screen character barely avoids was unavoidable for the real-life actor. Thus my use of the line from the film as my review title. Life imitates art, such a waste.

B003UESJHO|4.0|There have been a lot of boxing movies over the years. Rocky and Raging Bull stand apart as the greatest the genre has to offer. The Fighter is not far behind. In the works for years with a revolving door of directing and acting talent, the only constant was Mark Wahlberg. Seeing this film made has been a passion of Wahlberg's for over five years now, and once you see it, you'll understand why. David O Russell has crafted an intelligent, compassionate, and funny film about the concurrent rise and fall of boxers Micky and Dickie Ward, two Irish brothers living in Lowell, Mass in the early 1990s.<br /><br />Based on the true story of seemingly washed-up Micky Ward's rise to glory despite the downward spiral of his brother and the mismanagement of his lecherous mother, The Fighter had the potential to be just another syrupy underdog story. Luckily for all involved, a strong screenplay and the wealth of talent involved help to create a film that resonates much deeper than you might initially think. Russell has long proven to be a special director, with Three Kings and I Heart Huckabees, both past collaborations with Wahlberg, serving as high points on his resume. Those two films contain some of Wahlberg's best work, and the trend continues in The Fighter. Wahlberg gives a thoughtful, at times almost understated performance that really holds the film together. He doesn't make the character a clich&eacute; or stereotype, as easy as that might have been. It's not the flashiest role, and is nearly swallowed up by Christian Bale's performance, but Wahlberg's performance stands as further proof of a solid career, with many highlights yet to come.<br /><br />Speaking of Bale, a lot has already been said regarding his performance as the troubled crack-addicted former boxer Dickie Ward, but it bears repeating as his presence looms over the film regardless of whether or not he's on screen. Sporting a bald spot and gaunt frame, Bale appears here as a ghostly figure, a constant reminder to Micky of where this hard-luck life can lead. It's a wild, take-no-prisoners performance and the kind of stuff Oscar statues are made of, both hilarious and tragic. In a career chock-full of special performances, Christian Bale's riveting, manic portrayal of Dickie Ward stands alongside Patrick Bateman as the best of his career. The Oscar for Best Supporting Actor is a foregone conclusion. Melissa Leo and Amy Adams also deliver standout performances as Micky's mother and girlfriend, respectively. The two woman serve as opposing forces in Micky's life, and with Dickie serving as the wild card, there is plenty of turmoil surrounding Micky's battered career .<br /><br />I was surprised at the amount of genuine humor in The Fighter, as a film dealing with family turmoil, crack addiction, and violent beating for small paydays didn't initially seem a candidate for large helpings of comedy. It's never too much, however, and unlike True Grit, the director Russell seems to know when to draw the line and avoid compromising the tone of the film.Oddly enough, the film's only misstep comes in the ring, as the fight scenes lack the speed and intensity of Rocky or the cinematic verve of Raging Bull. Russell opted to shoot them from a broadcast perspective, and the resulting effect, complete with commentary, HBO graphics, and a marked change in cinematography, feels disjointed and underdeveloped. Still, Wahlberg is in fantastic shape and is more than convincing as a welterweight fighter. The punches pack a wallop, but suffer in comparison to the stomach punch of family drama that permeates Micky's climb to the top. Despite the tragedy of Dickie Ward and the awfulness of his = mother and sisters, The Fighter is a feel-good movie. We all know how it will end; it is based on a true story, after all. What matters is the fight to get there and, thanks to a screenplay which rises above clich&eacute; and a host of excellent performances, The Fighter is still standing tall at the final bell. 4.5 out of 5 stars.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|I not only like Chris Pine ever since I saw him in Star Trek, but Denzel Washington has put on some good performances too as well. I also have a soft spot for Nathan Suplee from his days on My Name Is Earl. I've worked in the industrial realm and can see something like this happening. Mr. Scott weaves a story that makes it just plausible enough that it could actually happen and since it was inspired by true events, well... Whatever plot holes and flaws in logic there may be if you look too close, I never noticed. I was enjoying myself too much.<br /><br />The movie starts slowly, at least to me it does, but that is kind of the point. It needs to build up to the real frantic climax. As things unfold, we learn bits and pieces about some of the characters, mainly Denzel and Chris's. One is on the verge of forced retirement while the other is on his umpteenth job. As the movie unfolds and things get dicey, they inevitably come to like and respect each other. Predictable, but so what? It still makes for a great and fun ride.<br /><br />The magnificent machines are big stars in this movie also. Those trains are powerful and almost unstoppable beasts and they take a lot of finesse to tame, despite what most people might think. I have a lot of respect for the real train engineers. I'm sure many of them have cringed at some of the scenes in this movie, but I didn't see their image really tarnished except by Nathan Suplee's screw-up which was the whole reason for the movie. Then again, as I said earlier, this has happened before and it's likely to happen again somewhere.<br /><br />I should also mention Rosario Dawson and Lew Temple as supporting characters. They helped make things interesting on the sidelines.<br /><br />This movie was a fun ride and I could watch again in a few months. Highly recommended.
B0043ISH6O|5.0|A lot of times a film soundtrack will add nothing to a movie, you won't be running out to purchase it, well this is truly an exception as the score that Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross have provided for one of the best films of the year is quite breathtaking!! Considering that The Social Network is a film that can't really be classed with a genre and is quite a dark movie then this soundtrack works with it really well.     Of course Trent Reznor(nine inch nails, how to destroy angels) And Atticus ross(how to destroy angels) have being working together for some time now, Atticus has had a hand in Nine Inch Nails last four albums(with teeth, year zero, ghosts i-iv and the slip) as well as working together on Saul Williams last album so they have built up quite a working relationship. For people who own Nine Inch Nails Ghosts i-iv album a lot of these pieces of music will seem like a continuation of that album, like the next part and will already be familiar with two pieces of music on the soundtrack, those being \\"A Familiar Taste\\" and \\"Magnetic\\" which are reworking's of two ghosts tracks, 35 Ghosts iv(a familiar taste) and 14 Ghosts ii(magnetic).     But this is far from recycled material as a listen to this soundtrack will show you, a lot of the times the pieces of music will start gentle with lovely pieces of piano before giving away to some big beats before drifting off again, it is of course used in full affect in the film.     You can't help but be blown away with the job they on classic piece \\"In The Hall Of The Mountain King\\" which Reznor himself admits was very challenging and \\"threw me for a loop\\" and took a few weeks to work it out, on hearing it Director David Fincher was blown away by the results and when you hear the piece in the film itself the result is breathtaking!!     The whole soundtrack is amazing and i'd highly recommend it along with the film itself, and if like this then make sure you pick up Nine Inch Nails album \\"Ghost i-iv\\" as well as AtticusRoss soundtrack for \\"The Book of Eli\\" which is also a great piece of work.     The Social Network could well be Film and Album of the year for 2010!!
B002N1AEN2|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite CDs period. For most CDs, I usually would have to skip every other song or so but not this one. I love and enjoy every single track on it. I play this on some B&W speakers, and it just takes me to another dimension. I've recommended this to a few people and they all love it as well. I even got my dad hooked on it.
B004GHYCKW|5.0|National treasure Polly Jean Harvey's eight studio album \\"Let England Shake\\" is a great album and shows that she's still as vital as ever, 4 LONG years have passed since 2007's \\"White Chalk\\" even though she did treat us to 2009's collaboration with John Parish, the excellent \\"A Woman A Man Walked By\\".     The first we heard of \\"Let England Shake\\" was when she appeared on The Andrew Marr Show in April 2010 to perform the title track, it ceartinly wetted our lips of what was to follow and now 10 months later the wait is over and i'm glad to say it's been worth it.     It's good to note that long time collabators John Parish and Mick Harvey are both present as is producer Flood(smashing pumpkins, depeche mode, u2, nine inch nails). The title track itself is a work of art with it's political overtones about the English and French armies invading Gallipoli in 1915(world war 1), the track itself features an Xylophone and an autoharp(it makes an apperance on a number of tracks) in fact in an recent interview Harvey said she took Autoharp and poetry lessons to help with the writing for this album. There's the blues influnced number \\"The Words That Maketh Murder\\" which is a real stand out track. Mick harvey even contributes vocals to final track \\"The Colour of the Earth\\". The real stand out track is \\"All and Everyone\\" which at over five minutes long is one of the best tracks she has ever written and continues the political theme on the album and shows why she's still so far ahead of everyone else when it comes to writing lyrics! \\"Written On The Forehead\\" uses a sample from legendary reggae producer Niney the Observer, the result is like the rest of the album outstanding!     Let England Shake features some of PJ Harvey's best work as well as most political and shows why she is such an influential figure, there won't be many better albums than \\"Let England Shake\\" this year!
B004EI3ON4|5.0|If you are an epic music lover and an electronic music lover, this is bliss.  I can't believe I waited this long after seeing the movie twice in 3D IMAX with 12000 watts bleeding my ears off and loving every minute of it.  I'm gonna have a hard drive not turning it up when I get the bluray.

0307739961|3.0|I had ordered this book from another vendor in December for a gift and got the gray black and red cover paperback version that was displayed.  However when I reordered for myself from a different vendor the cover of that book was not the same at all.  Very disappointed that the cover of the book did not match the picture on your site.  I also do not understand why it is so difficult to get this book in a paperback version when it supposedly came out in paperback last year.
0307272702|5.0|One of the most fascinating and enlightening books I've read. First half is a bit tough because it flies contrary to ingrained wisdom, but then the second half is truly a jaw dropping read. Anyone interested in weight loss or maintenance should give this a read.
B004EBT5CU|2.0|Maybe I'm missing something judging by all the great reviews but I was disappointed. I loved 19 (I could listen the whole way through and not skip a song)and have seen Adele live, and therefore pre-ordered 21, however the albums are simply not of the same quality.  You would think she had aged 20 years rather than 2 based on the boring music and/or depressing mediocre ballads, and lack of what I can only call \\"singability.\\"  While 19 had a lot of themes of unreturned love, it still managed to be fun to listen to and hopeful, or at least insightful.  There are a couple of good songs like \\"He Won't Go\\" and \\"Rolling in the Deep,\\"  but they are just not as good as \\"Chasing Pavements\\" or frankly ANY of 19's tracks. I just feel like I've heard it before.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I have watched the episodes everytime they appear on tv.  I have thoroughly enjoyed it, and here is the kicker.  When I first heard of another zombie pic all I did was gripe and cuss about how Hollywood is a mined out mess    I was never more wrong    If I had to choose a best characterization, I can't.  I loved Grimes, and the Pizza Guy.  Why? I don't know, perhaps it was because they are so damned human.    The only thing that caught me flat footed was the way they got through the zombie crowd...cutting up a zombie using the parts to disguise themselves.  Didnt see that coming but it was sheer genius.
1563899426|4.0|This first TPB has gotten me hooked so much that i have already ordered vol. 2 and the 2 \\"special\\" edition book as well (that collects the same issues as TPBs 3 & 4).    Anyway it is bit of a mix of police procedural, meets noir detective novels, meets grimm's fairy tale, meets Middle Earth.    The artwork is quite nice, and very traditional... The writing incorporates several genres but remains cohesive. What will sell you on the series is the characters, and this first volume definitely has me wanting to know more about them.
B003F1WM2K|5.0|I knew Patti Smith from a few poems and songs and had to look up Robert Mapplethrope.  Glad I did.  Truly an amazing story.  You do not need to know their work to get wrapped up in a totally unique love story.  This could have been a very different book if Smith would have zeroed in on her works but she tells THEIR story, tells it poignantly and with so much affection.  Odd couple in a time of great discovery; talented and seeking their own success, together.  This book makes me want to read more about the couple and their struggles.  Just an intelligent wonderful, tragic story. Much more than just kids.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Bought this cooler for my AMD Phenom II x4 940, and it was the best choice I could have made.  This cooler has allowed me to overclock my processor to 3.5GHz (stock is 3.0GHz) and run cooler than stock at the same time. I'm running it with an extra 120mm fan to allow for a push-pull configuration, and the cooling is simply stellar.  If you want the best price.performance ratio in a CPU cooler, look no further!    Pros:  - Excellent cooling  - Amazing price  - Supports dual 120mm fans    Cons:  -Installaiton a little difficult and requires removal of the mobo from your case.  This is not specific to this cooler, it's a necessary evil for all aftermarket coolers as far as I know.  - This cooler is LARGE, so make sure it will fit in your case before buying, or prepare to make some cuts in your door to allow it to fit.
B0031SCV46|5.0|I have had this keyboard for about a month and find its a really nice keyboard.     I would recommend getting the M-Audio SP-2 US65010 Sustain Pedal Piano Style Sustain Pedal for Keyboards to go with it.  It should be the only other hardware device you need as there are only 2 ports (USB and sustain pedal).    As one reviewer said, there is no DAW with it, but I didn't expect there to be one as its not mentioned in the description.  So if you don't have garage band, or another DAW, you may have to buy that, or look for a free one on the net.    No drivers was required to work with Garage Band, and direct link works well with Garage band, after installing a package from M-Audio's website.    As someone just starting out with a keyboard, I can't compare it with a real piano, or even with another keyboard.  But it does seem well made, and looks great.  I have enjoyed learning on it.
B004DWKO8Y|5.0|\\"What If\\" is the incredible new studio album from one of the most underrated rock bands of all time: Mr. Big. This album marks the return of Paul Gilbert, the band's original guitar player, and it feels and sounds like a logical follow-up to 1996's Hey Man, which was Gilbert's last album with the band. \\"What If\\" delivers all that fans have come to expect from Mr. Big: Eric Martin's soulful voice and heartfelt lyrics, Pat Torpey's masterful and rock-solid drumming, and the incredibly tasteful and often reserved guitar and bass pyrotechnics of Paul Gilbert and Billy Sheehan. I've been disappointed by a few reunion albums in the past, but this isn't one of them. I couldn't be more pleased with \\"What If\\", and I hope this is just the beginning of a long string of new material to come from Mr. Big.
B00004STPT|5.0|With the exception of the various Star Wars soundtracks this is the best out of any movie.  It won the 2000 Academy Award for best original score.  An award (for once) which was throughly deserved.  It captures the essence of the movie and especially the character, Maximus.  It enhances your perceptions of Maximus.  His sense of honour, courage and selflessness.  This soundtrack can be appreciated whether you like the movie or not.  My favourite is Now We are Free but they are all brilliant.  You'll play the music over and over again.  There's nothing more to say really.  All classical music fans should own this.
B00338QENI|4.0|I have thought about this book a lot as I read scientific discoveries, consider a nursing career and in general teaching my children about a story that I never knew. Henrietta's contribution, albeit unwillingly, and the loss that her family incurred - not only with her death - is as much a part of American history as anything else. Thank you for writing this book, Ms. Skloot. It is a wonderful, if not tragic tribute to her memory.
B00005JOA0|4.0|I took a chance in buying this movie without knowing any of the actors in it. It was worth it. I really enjoyed this movie. It's a classic.
B003UESJFG|5.0|If you ove Will Ferrell in general- then you'll love this funny flick! Megamind was refreshing for me in many ways- I feel like the overall plot was unexpected (not the outcome of the plot- the \\"bad\\" guy turns \\"good\\"). But to take a superman-like hero and a villian-like hero and have them behave like petty children is just plain comical. Tina Fey was a nice addition too (for those of 30 Rock watchers). Not a bad price for this set either! :D

B00190N4E4|5.0|I loved this movie the first time I saw it at the theatre (in 1982) and I just recently saw it again and still love it! What an amazing film about the life of Ghandi. What a truly moving movie this was. This movie addresses some of the injustices of this world and even though it was specific to events that took place in South Africa and India several decades ago, the subject matter is still relevant today in many areas of this world. This movie should be required viewing for all the people of earth.
B000O8OTNC|2.0|I got this to keep my knives sharp when out in the field camping, hiking, etc.<br /><br />The carbide tore up the blade and it took a long time to get it back using stones and eventually a Spiderco Sharpmaker.<br /><br />The ceramic is OK and the serration file is fair, but the carbide blades will bite chunks out of your knife and leave it jagged.

0143038419|5.0|Elizabeth Gilbert said that everyone, no matter the lifestyle, no matter the life circumstances, is looking for the same thing. I guess she is right. This book is about her search for meaning in her life, and it seems to resonate with a lot of other people's searches too, because it has universal appeal. I loved this book about a woman who was courageous enough to change her life by traveling to three carefully chosen places. She chose Italy for the language, the food, and the pursuit of \\"il bel far niente\\", the beauty of doing nothing. Next, she went to India to find God. Then, she went to Bali to find balance between the two. There she planned to teach English to Ketut, the village medicine man, and in return, he would teach her all he knew.<br /><br />Filled with delightful characters, incredible experiences, and wonderful and valuable truths, this is a wonderfully-enjoyable book, one that a reader mourns upon reaching the last page.
B0000025BA|5.0|Four decades later, Carole King's Tapestry still can hold it's own and will forever be a landmark album. The proof is sure in that Carole King is touring again, with James Taylor, and singing the time-enduring songs she penned long ago.<br /><br />With minimal production by Lou Adler, King's unadorned, honest vocals, coupled with her personal style are a constant throughout the ballads of Tapestry. Originally released in 1971, this album paved the way for female singer/songwriters. It is a refreshing change from most albums of that time, mainly because the featured instrument is the piano. The songs on this album do not suffer from lack of electric guitar or in-your-face drums.<br /><br />Tapestry features the two hit songs, \\"It's Too Late\\" and \\"I Feel The Earth Move.\\" King's piano pounds out a beat similar to drums on  \\"I Feel The Earth Move\\" which is sure to have your head bobbing, while her soulful vocals lend to the sexual theme of the song, without being raunchy. King's own version of \\"You've Got A Friend,\\" is notably the best song on the album. Even though most people relate \\"You've Got A Friend\\" to James Taylor, King's rendition of her own song is equally compelling; the words of this song are the ultimate anthem of deep, dedicated friendship. Most of the other songs of the album speak of loneliness or a desire to be at peace with one's self.<br /><br />Tapestry also contains two early compositions of hers, \\"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow\\" and \\"Natural Woman,\\" which will always be ingrained on our minds as the song we associate with Aretha Franklin.<br /><br />\\"Way Over Yonder\\" has a soulful, blues-y feel and features Curtis May on a tenor sax solo in the middle of the song. Poetic and beautiful, \\"Tapestry\\" deserves to hold the title of the album, while \\"Smackwater Jack\\" seems oddly misplaced on this album.<br /><br />Listening to this album will leave you with the feeling that you had a conversation with a long-time trusted friend, in the comfort of her living room. It is down-to-earth yet deep in the messages it conveys about life, love and the desire to be happy.deep in the messages it conveys about life, love and the desire to be happy.
2070612759|3.0|I hate the stupid blue-grey squares on the book. It ruins it, in my opinion. Also the font for the text looks silly.<br />The book is smaller than the English version I bought, which is annoying.<br /><br />The book itself is quite good. The morales in it are interesting, but the story itself is quite boring. Because it is a parable, one would be looking for metaphors everywhere, but in reality, a lot of the book is waffle.
0307454541|1.0|I won't pretend to be an English major, or connoisseur of great literature. Although I do agree that the writing is boring, I'm writing this review purely based off the content of this book.<br />The content of this book is disgusting. It glorifies heinous crimes. Honestly this book does not merit any great review...

B0001KZM3O|5.0|Absolutely stunning album by Roger Waters/Pink Floyd.  I love David Gilmour but with all due respect Roger Waters IS Pink Floyd.  He wrote all the music and lyrics and he has an amazing creative and innovative mind.  With that being said, this is my 3rd favorite PF album behind The Wall and Dark Side of the Moon.  Which is saying alot because I love all the PF albums and they are my favorite band of all time!!!  My very first concert was 1977 Pink Floyd Animals tour at Cleveland Stadium.  Absolutely amazing.  500 concerts later that was still my favorite of all time!!!
B000002GQK|5.0|Even better than the original Threshold LP! How nice to have a high quality recording without the scratches acquired since 1971!
B001TLQPXU|4.0|This is sold as a \\"multimedia cd,\\" which I assumed meant it had either a video or powerpoint slides.  That would have been helpful as I use the book as a business tool for culture change.  However, it's strictly an audio CD, read by John Kotter.  On the plus side, it has some additional comments by Kotter.
B00007BKVC|5.0|I purchased two of these dvds - one for myself and one as a gift.  It's a classic movie and was an excellent price on Amazon.
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|Amazing 4 disc set for this price.  Lethal Weapons are the type of films you can see over and over again too. Most people think their cheesy but I like cheesy action comedies. On top of the great cast they bring in Eric Clapton to do a lot of the music in the films as well.  The guitar and saxophone riffs make me laugh every time. Some of the films they're pretty out of control with the sax. but thats great!! Hopefully they release this same type of deal on an upconversioned blu-ray sometime. If your a fan of these films I recommend buying.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|Great CD. Gave it as a gift to a friend who was totally unfamiliar with Jimi Hendrix. Good choice to introduce someone to a great musician and performer.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Michael C. Hall may play other roles over the rest of his career, but he's never going to escape the idea that he is Dexter, South Florida's favorite serial killer.  Through four seasons, Hall and the \\"Dexter\\" team have created some of the most entertaining guilty-pleasure TV this side of \\"Deadwood.\\"     Season Four finds Dexter in a good place . . . at first.  The domestic content Dexter found at the end of Season Three by marrying the gorgeous Rita (Julie Benz) and assuming the role of father can only last so long.  Balancing a serial killer's existence with a job in law enforcement is one thing, but living with four new and demanding family members full time in suburbia can just plain cramp your style if you're looking to get out and murder someone.  Season Four finds plenty of dark comic relief for Dexter as he juggles his new roles with his old desires.    Thankfully, this is only a sidelight to the main plot of the season, which is the arrival of a new serial killer on the Miami scene - the Trinity Killer (John Lithgow).  Or perhaps, the re-arrival is more appropriate, as TK has been \\"working\\" for decades.  Nobody is happier to have Lithgow working in South Florida again than Dexter's foul-mouthed sister Debra (Jennifer Carpenter), as TK has long been hunted by FBI Special Agent Frank Lundy (Keith Carradine), her old flame.  Lundy has tracked TK for decades, believing that he has mastered TK's chilling habit of killing in threes all across the nation.      It is only a matter of time before Dexter and TK cross paths, but not as you might expect.  Lithgow, among the most charming of actors, gets downright evil in this role and serves as a diabolical foe for Dexter.    This season has everything a \\"Dexter\\" fan can hope for - lots of blood, lots of sex, lots of witty, dark humor.  Just when everything seems too dark, the writers bring in comic relief to keep things balanced (Matsuka gets a lot of his trademark goofy lines - classic stuff).    Again, you cannot start \\"Dexter\\" with Season Four, even though you'll get the rhythm of the show very quickly.  There is a lot of backstory in play in this season, and if you haven't watched the first three seasons a lot of this season won't resonate.      But if you have seen the first three seasons, the fourth is a pure pleasure, right up to the shocking final minute. Check it out.
B003SHYKU8|5.0|I was looking for a comedy that didn't cost half as much a movie theater ticket, and wasn't based on humorous violence, which was hard to find this day...    Took a chance on this one, and was satisfied. It's not very funny, and has some of the annoying standard, cliche Hollywood attributes...    Nevertheless, it has some great moral lessons woven into light humor, and was engaging as well as enjoyable to watch!
0061726826|5.0|I don't normally read young adult novels however, I was drawn to the cover of \\"Before I Fall\\". Once I read the synopsis, I was curious (that too is a \\"must read\\"). Lauren Oliver's ability to tell such a beautiful story in \\"Before I Fall\\" had me so excited to read \\"Delirium\\". My excitement was justified.... I wont review the manuscript content as plenty others already have. I will say, regardless of your age group, this is such a moving story and will have you accessing your own life. A definite \\"Must Read\\"
0743454537|5.0|Spoilers  I could not put this book down; I had a friend who was passed away due to lukimia and I could understand the parents doing everthing they could to keep their child alive. Unfortunately, it was at the cost of Anna's childhood, but Anna, like most siblings, would do everything possible to help save her sister. Right till the end all Anna was doing was rooting for her sister. When you found that out, it was a surprise, but it made sense. Her sister was struggling with cancer and she too had to grown up fast due to her illness. She did have her good times in remision, dating her boyfriend and going to dances, as did Anna, but there were also times they had to spend all their time in the hospital including the holidays of course, which is inevitable. Furthermore, Kate and her sister both had to undergo many procedures and at this point, Kate, not Anna, did not want to go through it. The ending was morbid and surprising, probably not likely (I can't say not possible, but probably not). Anna saved her sister right till the end and that was all she wanted to do. I'm not going to say the ending is awesome, because I don't understand people saying its awesome that a child passed away, but I will say it was creative and it got us thinking. The meaning was open for interpretation and unlike the movie (also a sad ending) it was not spoonfed to us. Some people prefered the ending to the movie because at least Kate died in her bed with family, whereas passing away in a car accident it terrible. However, I think the author has talent.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I have the city mini stroller and it has NO accessories, we've been without a cup holder or anything to put my stuff in.  fianlly i saw someone had used this for their city mini, much cheaper than what they offer for their strollers, so i thought why now.  ordered it and love it.  I think i can use it pretty much anywhere even after i am done with the stroller.

B002ZG976U|3.0|This film is mildly entertaining. Nothing special at all. I find Christina Aguilera could do so much better. Sadly, she lacks the pizzaz for that magic cabaret-style entertainer's character. Learn from Liza Minelli(Cabaret), Catherine-Zeta Jones(Chicago) and even the ice queen herself that is Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge! You got to really give your heart and soul and guts to be a stage entertainer Christina darling. Very shallow character.<br /><br />Cher is just there for the condiments. Stanley Tucci never changes his modus operandi since he is the same tired old gay man in practically every films that requires him to be a gay man. The songs are mediocre. it's entertaining but you feel cheated because you have seen many of the cliches happened in this film. It's not bad but it's not that great either. It would be better if these characters are given more depth and the songs are chosen very carefully. I am a big fan of Cher and Miss Aguilera, but this flick undermined<br />their talents. It could be better in my humble opinion.<br /><br />Rent first, that is my advice. If you like it, good for you. If you feel otherwise, well it doesn't hurt either. At least you know what's Burlesque is all about.
B002VPE1XY|5.0|Having seen many reviews for this product go up not long after the initial offering was made through Amazon's Vine program, I figured I'd hold off until I'd used the case for an extended period of time, just for the sake of testing its longevity. Now, after 8 months of fairly consistent travel and use, I'm very please with how well it has held up after being thrust in and out of pockets and backpacks, and set down on all manner of surfaces in all manner of weather. The case design is functional, not fancy, and the fit on my Panasonic Lumix FH20 is very snug, which is exactly what I was hoping for. Obviously, different camera brands will yield different results. The magnetic clasp is also snug, in large part due (once again) to my camera's tight fit, but once it's in place, it stays there, and has NEVER popped open unexpectedly. The soft material on the inside of the case is a huge improvement over lower-end cases made entirely of thin faux-leather inside and out.    The only drawback to this case -- and it would depend entirely on how you like to port your camera around -- is the velcro belt strap, which would offer little resistance to a thief if you were wearing the case on your belt. Then again, even a metal clamp would only offer moderately stronger protection against a good hard yank. Mind you, a thief is either gonna yank your camera no matter what's holding it to your belt, or ignore it completely because it draws instant attention of the wearer. If you're like me, and you carry your camera in a pocket, even when it's in the case, this will be of little concern.    Apart from that, this is a well-designed and practical case. Just remember to measure your camera against the dimensions provided on the product page. As mentioned, I've been using it for 8 months and have really enjoyed the extra attention it affords my Lumix, which was purchased only days before Amazon made this case available last June.      I also appreciated the AmazonBasics packaging, which went immediately into the recycle bin. Hope to see more of this in the future, particularly on items that often come entombed in acres of heat-sealed plastic!

B002XMGGK6|4.0|Not much I can add this late in the game, but this turned out to be a pleasant surprise, a bald (and more than a little obvious) morality play gussied up with some lovely exploitation elements and one mother of a payback scheme, not to mention the kind of movie that gets up more than a few critics' noses while still performing well at the box-office and attracting an appreciative audience on home video, in large part due to its impressive production value and convincing performances, and often in spite of its seeming tendency to stretch credibility (I say \\"seeming\\" because, as always, a viewer's acceptance of the film's plot depends in part on familiarity with U.S. law). The DVD provides an above-average overall package; excellent image and sound quality when upscaled via my Blu-ray player to my 58\\" TV, and a batch of informative, complementary extras that dig deeper than the usual EPK stuff (though some of the docu material certain qualifies for that moniker). The audio commentary by two of the film's producers offers respectable enlightenment, though the absence of director F. Gary Gray is felt. Definitely a film I'll revisit for kicks some time in the future.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I had been waiting anxiously for the Star Wars blu-ray release. I own the original theatre release of IV, V and VI. I also purchased the so-called \\"enhanced versions\\". I was prepared to buy the six film blu-ray set, only to find it won't include the original theatre versions. I simply don't understand the logic. I understand wanting to have continuity with the later films but, don't alienate :) the old school fans. I hope George is reading these reviews. There is a large portion of his audience that feels this way. I will wait until I hold the box in my hands to confirm there are no original versions. If there aren't, I for one will not be making the purchase.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|Prior to purchasing this, I had read numerous different reviews about several discs not working properly. I was afraid I would be unlucky and get certain discs not working properly, but this was extremely worth it compared to buying all the seasons separately. I did encounter broken discs ultimately, but there were only 2 I believe. One was the first disc in season 3 and another in the later seasons. Although it was frustrating, it wasn't TOO big a deal to me and not enough for me to send the item back to get another new one that could possibly also have more defective discs. I was already content enough with the rest of the episodes, this is a superb series and I am still so glad a friend from high school recommended it to me. Every time I had passed by the WB11 back then and saw a commercial for this show I had disregarded it as something I would never watch but now it is basically my favorite television show of all time. I will definitely be rewatching this show again in the near future to relive the memories. A lot of people commented on disliking the packaging but I actually extremely like it. Definitely worth your money!
B004289ZW0|4.0|This small GPS receiver connects to my ipad via bluetooth.  I don't have GPS on the ipad.  Now I can use an aviation app, ForeFlight, for aircraft approach plates and charts.  After I downloaded the app, I tried the bluetooth connection.  My physical location was noted on the ipad and moved as I flew the airplane.
B004GHYCKW|5.0|I Can't put all the technical jargen that other's have put into thier reviews for this album! All i know is that this cd is a must have for any PJ Harvey fan. Unlike her two previous albums which i picked and choosed songs i liked and those i didnt. This album i liked from start to finish!    Favorite songs on this album are Let England Shake and The Glorious Land somethign about the beat to them. Also this album has alot of long intro's into two   minute songs which was kinda kool. Again if you like PJ Harvey this album is defiently for you, If you just discovering Harvey for the first time it will be a good album for you to discover her amazing music!
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second entry in the Hunger Games series is another spectacular read.  Our heroine, Katniss Everdeen, has arrived home a victor of the Hunger Games, but her duties to the Capital are not over; she soon will have to embark on a tour of the twelve Districts.  Of course, that means that Peeta will have to accompany her, and the Capital is expecting that she will convince everyone that she and Peeta are still a loving couple.  However, immediately before the tour, Katniss receives a visit that changes everything forever.<br /><br />Although \\"Catching Fire\\" cannot re-capture the novelty of the first entry, it more than makes up for it with the break-neck pace of its thrilling plot.  Fans of the series will probably be very pleased with the book, which incorporates so much of what made \\"The Hunger Games\\" special while also moving in a new and exciting direction.  Katniss continues to be a compelling character - so strong yet mixed with appealing vulnerability and doubt.  As she explains, \\"[a] leader should be someone with conviction, and I'm barely a convert myself.\\"  She is propelled forward constantly by her desire to do the right thing; yet she learns that horrible consequences often ensue.<br /><br />I usually read several books at the same time, alternating between them.  Once I picked up \\"Catching Fire,\\" though, I put aside all other books and blazed through it quickly.  This one is truly a page-turner of the highest order.  The book ends on a bit of a cliffhanger, so I was happy that the third and final Hunger Games book - \\"Mockinjay\\" - is already available.  I downloaded it and started it before I even had time to start this review.  This adult reader is pleased that I took a chance on this young adult series.
B001ACY8D2|5.0|A beautiful album.  There are songs which actually move me to tears.  It creates a mood, no doubt.  Highly recommend!  Especially on vinyl.  Yummy.
0743298039|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  I did not find myself puzzled throughout the whole book but I did have to work to figure things out.  Very easy flowing writing style.
0307454541|4.0|I saw the movie, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, before reading Steig Larsson's book, and I really enjoyed it. The movie is very true to the novel, but the main surprise I found in reading was how handsome and intriguing the main character was meant to be. Lisbeth's attraction to him is much more believable in the book. And Lisbeth herself is perfectly cast! I think I liked the book even better than the movie.<br /><br />The story starts slowly with lots of details of financial intrigue that really don't intrigue me at all. But Lisbeth's story, woven between, keeps me reading till Blomkvist comes to life. Now I'm pulled in by mystery, fascinating characters, corruption and careful investigation. The author plants details very cleverly, leading the reader to see through the character's eyes--what did he notice? Why is he looking again? Then finally he finds it.<br /><br />Meanwhile Lisbeth becomes far more than a tortured genius. There are depths and mystery in her, partly explained, partly hid, that will certainly have me coming back for more in the next book.<br /><br />The characters are deeper and more fascinating in the book than in the movie. The locales are beautifully scripted. The plot is both more complex and more believable. And the whole is a great read--well, as long as you get past (but don't skip) the economics at the start. (Yes, sorry; the economic arguments are essential to the plot.)<br /><br />Time to watch the next movie now, and read the next book.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was given the three books in this series as a gift.
B00280LYIC|5.0|My friend let me borrow this book. I'd never even heard about it before, but I have to say that this is probably the start to my second favorite book series (next to Harry Potter). It has a very interesting plot and a strong conclusion, not leaving many unanswered questions but makimg you want to read the next book. I would  rate it ten stars if the maximum wasn't five. Overall it was a great book.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I didn't see this show until it was on DVD. First of all, the packaging is nice and compact. While not in those nifty one-piece plastic cases, it has two individual cases for the discs in a cheap but useable case.    On to the content...    The show is very funny. The varied characters come from all walks of life: Christian black mother, JW black former athlete, Muslim pop-culture guru, agnostic sarcastic ex-lawyer, \\"crusading\\" athiest, naive Jewish smart high-school graduate, racist old man, crazy Oriental spanish teacher. Add a British teacher and a wacky dean, a cast of funny bit-characters and you have a recipe for good times.    Don't miss this TV show!
1591843162|4.0|I've always appreciated Seth's pithy, big picture observations. This is a good book--a great book if you've never heard the message before--but I think it's got one glaring flaw: being indispensable means that you're still looking for some else's approval. In other words, thinking of yourself as indispensable isn't enough (or even necessarily true); what Seth's proposing, as far as I can tell, is that you make yourself indispensable to *others*. That requires other people to value what you do, and to want it. And that, my friends, requires those other people to recognize that you are a linchpin and what your value is. If they don't? It doesn't matter one whit whether or not you're a linchpin.    Given that, isn't Seth just proposing a variation on a theme of \\"fitting in\\", but well padded with critiques of the \\"system\\"?
B004F4HWPS|5.0|Several years ago I bought a bootleg CD of this concert,it was poorly mixed, laden with synths and sounded unlike the wailers I rember seeing during the seventies. On an expedition to the states i visited the site of this extraordinary concert and bought a copy of the just then released Roxy concert from LA. I bought this vinyl set,on it's day of release, it is well packaged with a tour programme and excellent photo's, and beautifully pressed in clear crisp shining 180grm vinyl. The sound is for the most part excellent, it is an unedited though well mixed true version of the concert so contains every song delivered that night. If nothing else this is a vital memory to pocess, the extraordinary Nesta Robert Marley's last ever concert in it's entirety. It begins with greetings and references to selassi before opening with Natural Mystic setting the spiritual tone for the evening.The band works through Marley's then big tunes, there is no one love or Buffalo Soldier which both came later. This set represents work from Exodus and Rastaman Vibration, a welcome revisit to No Woman No Cry, his breakthrough live recording from the lyceum in London, to then current new work, Work, Coming in from the cold and could you be loved.These are the least successful, the band selling the new album, The tour is just beginning and Bob is quite ill, these tunes don't have the history and self awareness of the older material.I miss the nyahbingi of the earlier Wailers but this is tear jerking stuff. Within hours Marley was according to Rita's memory stolen by her in the night and flown to Dr Issels clinic where he survived in a winterwonderland before passing into legend. A must have concert for anyone with a sense of history, ourstory. This was the last ever concert by the first third world superstar. Buy it, listen to it, cry with it. These truly are Redemption songs, an aural history of the Trenchtown experience. Jah love.
B0044KU7KU|5.0|I have the first 2 major albums released by MCR and would rank this one up there as one of the best.  It has a good mix of heavy hitting tracks as well as some more somber but equally catchy tunes.  I had my doubts about getting this album after such a long time between releases but would certainly recommend this to any person who enjoys this sound of music.  If you liked Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge there is a very good chance you will find this cd equally good.  Five Stars.  NA NA NA (NA NA NA NA NA NA NA)
B0025VLEM0|5.0|I own over 1400 dvds. Out of this list there is a dffinite top 10 of what gets repeatedly watched by the whole family at various times and not always together.<br />Shaun of the Dead is in that Top 10. It is because of that movie that I love playing Left for Dead 1 and 2 and any other video game with zombies. They turned zombie killing into an enjoyable art. This is a true cult classic that will be around for many generations to come. George Romero freaked me out with \\"Barbra they're coming to get you\\" lines. Shaun of the Dead fights back. I am no longer freaked. I fight back and laugh while doing it.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|You've seen instances of art imitating life or, life imitating art, but in this case, art imitates art.  Kudos to the writers of TVs hit series 'Castle'.  Heat Wave sizzles.  True to form, the protagonists (writer Richard Castle and police detective Kate Beckett)find themselves in a fast-paced murder plot.<br /><br />A multi-millionaire power broker is dead.  Who did it?  What was the motive?  And once Castle and Beckett find that his life has been an illusion, solving the murder and its mysteries gets even more complicated.<br /><br />I found only two drawbacks and you may not agree.  As I read, I visualized the actual TV stars portraying the story.  For some, this is a plus.  I prefer to 'see' characters  as the author's prose paints them in my imagination.  The second negative was my expectation of dialogue.  If we accept the premise that Richard Castle is a best-selling author--and that he wrote this book, then we expect sharp repartees and crisper word choices.  The dialogue was lackluster.<br /><br />Other than that, this is a thoroughly enjoyable read.  The plot has more twists than a  Swiss Alpine road.  Just when you think you know the killer's identity, another suspect's motives become plausible.  Each character's voice is clearly defined--excellent writing here--as are the settings.  If you enjoy murder mysteries, thrillers, and the 'Castle' TV show, this one's definitely a 'hottie' for you.
B0031RS8NK|5.0|I can not remember the last time that I laughed so much and also wholeheartedly cried while reading a book. Sophie Kinsella has outdone herself with Twenties Girl and this is by far my favorite novel of hers... and this is coming from a HUGE fan of the Shopaholic Series. The story honestly touches your heart and you really feel for all of the characters. It's funny, it's touching and it makes you want to go and hug and sit down for a long chat with every one of your family members.<br /><br />I have suggested Twenties Girl to all of my friends and I hope like them you take me up on my suggestion... you will not regret it!
B000002LQR|5.0|wow.... by far chili peppers' best album. every track is a winner - they grow on you at different rates so you can listen to this album again and again and still notice new things.  for those who don't know much chili peppers i would absolutely recommend this as the album to begin from. not as punk/funk as their earliest albums and not as mellow(/boring) as the latest ones.  i rate this as my favourite album.... ever! definitely worth the cost price of a few clams. buy it.
031603438X|3.0|After 324 reviews and still counting, what can I add to this discussion? First this book is too long. Keith Richards is a moderately significant figure, not the Bach or Mozart of his age as he seems to imagine. Having said that, by far the most interesting parts of this tome are where he discusses the mechanics of making music and writing songs. One cannot doubt the absolute commitment and passion Richards brings to his music-making. He learned his craft as a kid and honed it through the long years on the road. So these parts of the book give us insight into a genuinely creative mind.<br /><br />That has to be balanced by the endless boring recitations of drug binges without end, sprinkled with the author's vaguely comical and ridiculous racist and sexist riffs. I'm not saying he's either racist or sexist -- just hopelessly old fashioned and behind the times. All the talk about \\"pooftas\\" and the sexual habits of \\"black mamas\\" I could have easily done without. Likewise the drugs -- one's own addiction, I suppose, is endlessly fascinating. The addictions of others are tedious.<br /><br />Much has been made of Richards' love-hate relationship with Mick Jagger -- but he lacks the ability to bring Jagger or anyone else to life as a character.<br /><br />As for Richards' performance as a parent, described here without a trace of regret or guilt, appalling is way too mild a term.<br /><br />In the end, by some miracle, Richards survived to tell his tale -- and tell it he does. I guess I'm glad I read this book but I would have appreciated it more if it had been 200 pages shorter.
B003R0LBVW|5.0|Freedom is an epic, uncomfortable novel, one that challenges our feelings about ourselves and our relationships.    I have experienced with my own daughter much of what Walter and Pattie endured with Joey, and felt threatened by the freedoms she is entitled to in these times. In many ways I feel I know most of the character all to well and sympathize with their flaws and their near heroic methods to survive ther flaws and forge their way through these modern times.    Franzen is the Tolstoy, Cheever and Updike of the new millenium, and although his book is far from perfect, it is written in a voice that is collectively of our generation, whatever our age, income or social status.     Freedom is a tour de force and potential readers should not be scared away by the many, less than stellar reviews of readers.
B001HQZJPM|5.0|As a big fan of the Mummy trilogy and not the Scorpion King movies, I was excited that I found the trilogy of only the mummy movies! One of the dvd's had no device security tape but other than that, all these two disc edition dvd's are a great collection!
0060936223|4.0|As I read this book, I felt its incantatory power, much like Ms. Smith's stage presence. I couldn't figure out if it was just the writing or the fact that I remember so well places like Max's Kansas City, Le Jardin, the Automat, and of course, the omnipresence of Andy Warhol during these years. I loved the story. Her relationship with Mapplethorpe is heart breaking, inspiring and clearly, as she says, one of muse/artist, artist/muse. Her analysis of what Mapplethorpe brought to photography via his very disturbing sexual images, is really thought provoking, especially in these far more Puritanical times that we live in. Her forte is her unique vision of what rock and roll an be, of its revolutionary potential, of its willingness to encompass all of it, its fire-tongued accusations, its angry sexuality. She \\"has a lot of references\\" as she says about herself,as she uses the inspiration of people like Rimbaud, Joan of Arc,and Gregory Corso to guide her from a poor assembly line working in New Jersey to the unique, mind blowing rock star she became. All along the way, \\"Robert\\" is there for her and she for him.   It is so refreshing to watch her bear witness to his life, to fulfill her promise to tell his story, and to live a life of literate discussion, truth seeking, and honoring people who actually did something with their lives, rather than the celebrity worship that seems to be a cultural obsession now.  Having said that, there were a few places in the book that brought me up short. She and Robert are walking down the street one day and suddenly she hears \\"Because the Night\\" blasting from several different radios. She casually mentions that this was a song she wrote with Bruce Springsteen. He makes no appearance in the book, he is not referenced at all; it's a huge event in her life and it just gets dropped into the story.  The narrative tone of the book is of a reverential innocent. Perhaps that's what Ms. Smith was when she first arrived in the city, but I adoredher because of her rage, her \\"spit in your face\\" rebellion, and her androgony. None of that is present. She is sweet, innocent and somewhat untouchable in the book.  I found myself also wishing for a little more acknowledgement of the wider scope of things that were happening in our country at that time. The Vietnam War is barely touched on, neither is civil rights, or any of the other social upheavals that were energizing people and also tearing them apart. It's a somewhat myopic view of an extremely complex time. Andy Warhol helped set the tone for the excesses of the '80s, of the \\"art as commerce\\" tradition that still blooms happily in our midst. He did a lot of damage in addition to creating a lot of good art. She has so many idols and guardian angels. I wished that once in a while she would have pulled back and given them a closer look at their non-angelic sides as well. But a great read, a fascinating woman.
B002ZG99TK|5.0|I really liked this movie.  Not overloaded with filler and CG, and it has a pretty good story line.
031603438X|5.0|I laughed out loud when I read about that one and the others like it. You'll also learn the origin of the names Exile on Main St., Voodoo's Lounge and how to remove the low E string and tune your guitar properly to play your favorite Keith riffs. There's even a handy cooking tip for your next Shepherd's Pie.<br />I really enjoyed reading this book. Keith has remembered a lot of things about his life and bought lost diaries and journals back from collectors to fill in the gaps.<br />When you read books about famous people like this you realize how similar they are to you and me except that they were in the right place at the right time with the right skills and occupation. And you learn first hand how maybe the huge success we all dream of isn't always all it's cracked up to be.<br />During a lot of the book I wondered when the talk about smack would end but in hindsight I think that the amount of discussion is in ratio to the amount of time it occupied his life.<br />Keith Richards 'walks the walk'. He has a thorough understanding of and great ability to play the Chuck Berry and Chicago Blues styles of guitar playing and is responsible for exposing those sounds to an entire generation all over the world. Despite all the ups and downs he's been through...and he is a very lucky man...he has never stopped doing what he likes best and what got him here, playing guitar.
B002ZG974M|5.0|A must-see for those who love family and children.  Never a dull moment.  Beautifully filmed and edited. A wonderful comparison of cultures and child rearing.  Always entertaining - funny and heartwarming along with thought provoking.

Both my husband and myself have not only lost weight, but our cholesterol counts are now excellent and my husband has been able to cut out 1 of many blood pressure medications. As time goes on, I have no doubt that he'll be cutting out most BP medications, but not all.<br />I've also found that I don't have any bloating, gas, etc.. It's completely gone. We both also have a ton of energy that we didn't have before.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|As someone old enough to actually remember being awestruck at seeing the original Star Wars (Episode IV now) at the movie theater in 1977, I don't think it's a minor quibble to hate the remakes.  How many editions has Lucas put out now of the original trilogy, about 6?  I won't buy this series on blu-ray until the original, \\"Han shot Greedo first\\" and \\"No CG Skinny Jabba\\" for Han to step on version is available.  While not a big fan of episodes 1-3, for the sake of completeness I would buy this version if released.  This may never happen, but that just means I'll never see it on blu-ray.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Mockingjay was supposedly going to be the big finish to Katniss' story. But it wasn't as good as I thought it was. It droned on about how she would fix things, all the loneliness of Peeta not being there, seeing the ruins of District 12, on and on. And...I shouldn't give this away if you have not read the book yet, but...the ending was also not spectacular like you would expect from Suzanne Collins. Katniss got married to Peeta, they had kids, blah. This last book is not as good as the first two. That's all I'm saying.
B001KL3GZO|3.0|The sound quality for this Legacy Edition is crisp and crackling--somehow you were able to hire Miles Davis's 1959 group and they're right there in your living room playing for you and your guests. The ultra-clear recording quality of Jimmy Cobb's cymbal crash at the beginning of Miles's solo in \\"So What\\" is clean and pristine: the listener can hear the fizzle and sizzle gradually fade away into the ozone. Has there ever been a cymbal crash more vividly recorded? In fact, I highly recommend this CD for audiophiles, as it sounds similar to one of those Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs Recordings the Stereo Review crowd pays massive moolah for.       Yet the myriad awards and accolades this album has received boggles the mind.  Let's see now (throat clearance): in 2008 it was certified QUADRUPLE PLATINUM by the RIAA (and here I thought jazz albums with no discernable concession to commercialism sold around 30,000 copies or so), it is considered by many sheep, er, critics, to be \\"the greatest jazz LP of all time,\\" Rolling Stone rated Kind of Blue #12(!) on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, in 2002, it became one of just 50 recording chosen by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry, on December 16,2009 the US House of Representatives (apparently bored out of their collective skulls) passed a resolution honoring the 50th anniversary of this LP and \\"reaffirming jazz as a National Treasure\\" (as if they didn't have anything better to do such as, oh, maybe balancing the budget or something trivial like that), one reviewer actually called it \\"the defining moment in 20th century music,\\" (I always thought that was the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper), and there are even a couple of DVDs which detail the story of the birth of this album.  In Bethlehem.  In a manger.  In fact, rumor has it that there is a church starting up in San Francisco that WORSHIPS THIS ALBUM!    Please.    Like Duke Ellington's similarly overrated Black, Brown and Beige, one has to be constantly reminded as to the \\"importance\\" of it all, especially from a historical perspective, in order to fully appreciate it.  The problem is: Kind of Blue doesn't SOUND important, or even innovative, upon first listening. What I'm saying is people have to READ about how good it is and once they do, THEN they appreciate it. But this adulation doesn't occur just by listening to it. Only after the jazz media straightens you out with a visit to \\"Jazz Re-education Camp\\" regarding this release does one come to recognize it's supposed \\"magnificence,\\" a bit late in the game, but better late than never. You have been brainwashed, after all.    To paraphrase Mark Twain, it is actually much better than it sounds! Other problems with the most overrated album in jazz (or any other music's) history:    (1) There are no up-tempo tracks--a major disapointment given that the horn players are monsters of up-tempo soloing.    (2) The first two tracks on this CD (\\"So What\\" and \\"Freddie Freeloader\\") are taken and the same tempo and sound way too similar to be placed next to each other.(Shades of the Beatles' Second Album with \\"Money\\" and \\"You Can't Do That\\" in a similar position).    (3) Bill Evans has always bored me silly--but never more so than on this LP.  His playing here is coma-inducing. And Wynton Kelley doesn't sound much more interested on his solitary effort.    (4) \\"Blue in Green\\" (which Miles gets a composer credit for, even though he had nothing whatsoever to do with writing it) is a somnambulistic snooze-fest. Yawn!    (5) I've spoken with jazz fans who dislike the cool West Coast Jazz that was popular around the same time this disc first came out.  \\"Too lethargic and sluggish,\\" they said about albums by Chet Baker, Gerry Mulligan and that ilk. But these same people absolutely ADORE this album, the first three tracks of which have an air of shleppy sluggishness rarely heard on even the most tepid WCJ disc! I'd like someone to explain this one to me (that is,why cool jazz critics univerally love this album).    (6) There are two blues on this LP.  I didn't realize that blues were modal. Yes, blues changes are simple, but I thought the point of this LP was to eschew chord changes altogether! Am I missing something here?    To be sure, I don't really dislike this album.  It has positive aspects, too: Coltrane and Adderley's solos on \\"Flamenco Sketches\\" are heartbreakingly beautiful and, to me, the highlight of this disc.  \\"All Blues\\" with its 6/8 meter is an intriguing piece of work with a \\"Far Away Places\\" kind of feel, and then again there is the superb recording quality this reissue brandishes. It's a pleasant disc.    But I just don't understand what fuss is all about, all the adulation. Drummer Jimmy Cobb has reiterated much the same thing in various interviews. The Miles LP released just prior to this one, \\"Milestones\\" is vastly superior in every way. But for some reason people don't seem to talk much about that one.
078401213X|1.0|And what a mistake that was.  I'm into artsy, obscure movies but this was a complete waste of time.  The black and white picture quality was very poor at times. I don't know if they were going with the gritty look or not, but it didn't work.  The movie was just boring and painful to watch.  And now I'm wasting time writing a review for this and I'll just leave it at that.
3895086894|5.0|The product and service were just as advertised.  The books were in fine condition, the price was fair, and the delivery was on time.  Can't ask for more than that, can you?
0060989157|5.0|I think the obvious appeal here for people considering this book is that there will be salacious details of wild rock 'n' roll escapades. The book has that, in spades. Any crazy thing you can imagine a rock star or a group of rock stars doing, it's in here. Celebrity dish, check. Debauchery, check. Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll, check. What I didn't expect from this book is that a huge amount of it is incredibly touching. I mean it. Neil Strauss did a great job of getting the guys to talk about everything - not just the wild and crazy stuff they did, but their childhoods, their relationships with their parents, their wives and kids, how they learned about music, all of it. And how they feel about each other.     For all that you would look at these four men and think, this is the dream, and they're living it - each person in the band has gone through a lot of personal turmoil. Nikki Sixx had a nightmare childhood that would have scarred anyone. Tommy Lee had a great childhood but has struggled with impulsivity and anger issues, and through a painful divorce that separated him from his children, who he obviously adores. Mick Mars, it's clear to me, has some kind of Asperger's and also has a chronic debilitating bone disorder that is incredibly painful. Vince Neil grew up in a gangland war zone and had to watch his four-year-old die of cancer. There's angst here aplenty, along with way more humility than I thought I'd see, and a definite appreciation for the fact that these guys are luckier than most.     The wild and crazy stuff is wild and crazy - and fun - but I didn't expect this book to make me cry. Vince talking about his daughter's death was so heartbreaking I had to put the book down and go cry in the bathroom for about 20 minutes; I haven't been able to read it again since. I have a four-year-old and the things that Vince went through when his daughter got sick would wreck anyone; I would have tried to drink myself to death too. The letters to Pamela AndersonTommy includes are so raw and heart-wrenching, you can't help but feel for him. There is recklessness and chauvinism and stupidity and bad decisions aplenty in all of their tales, but here's the thing - they KNOW it. They have uncanny recognition for when they've done something really dumb that has screwed up their lives. And they are usually pretty sorry. The best part of the book is the unflinching self-awareness and confrontation of their pasts. These four men are able to turn a bright light onto themselves and their lives almost anyone else would try to hide from. It's marvelous. The antithesis of privileged rock-star posturing.    If you don't like rock 'n' roll or are easily offended by tales of violence, drunkenness, drug use, sex, corruption of near-minors, nudity, destruction, filth, poor personal hygiene, etc. - this is not the book for you. Go read something from Oprah's book club. But even if you are not a huge Motley Crue fan - and I wasn't - this is a fantastic, entertaining, thought-provoking read. I couldn't put it down and then as soon as I finished it, I went back to the beginning and read it over again. It's a heck of a ride and one you won't want to get off of when it stops.
B0041KKYCY|3.0|I have to make it known right now I never saw the original version of this film. Hell I never heard of it before I saw the trailer for this version.<br /><br />I was doing the usual wandering around Hulu just getting some insight on the up and coming movies. The trailer implied the rape of course but made it very very clear she didn't just take it and shrink away and spend the rest of the movie crying.<br /><br />I didn't know how I should feel once the movie came out. I'm not a fan of rape scenes in movies. To this day I can't watch Pulp Fiction without skipping the gun shop scene just because THAT was too much for me. I never finished The Hills Have Eyes, didn't care to even see the seconds one, nor did I watch Last House on the Left at the beginning. So I clearly have no taste for rape movies.<br /><br />But why did I watch it? I guess it was curiosity. I will be honest I didn't see the full rape scenes. I skipped ahead after they got in her cabin, saw a bit of the scene with Matthew raping her, then some of the sheriff's part in the woods. I felt sick, I mean I suppose if a movie or any form of entertainment makes you feel real emotions they have to be doing something right... right?<br /><br />On any hand I couldn't see the entire rape because for me I'd be stuck with it for days, reliving it over and over and hating myself. Stuff like that to the core makes the viewer feel like a helpless bystander. You feel like you want to intervene and help her but you can't you're forced to watch this and for the most part movies make the rape seem like some sort of leaves falling from a tree being cut down aka slow motion, soft opera type music playing while feeling like it's the end of the world concept.<br /><br />Her revenge of course I watched that from the start. I wasn't aware of the time lapse from the rape to the revenge but it made sense for her to take that time to get healed, it'd been less believable that she just appeared a few days later and tortured them. I found myself cheering for all of them except the mentally handicapped one... he did invoke a lot of sympathy but at the same time he still did it and she had to do what she had to do.<br /><br />She was creative in lots of ways for how she went about getting them all back, BUT she didn't seem like the type to be as technical as she was...  I kept thinking, 'How did she know how to do that?' Or my other questions, 'Where'd she get the clothes? How did she go from city girl to survivalist?' But at the same time it shows that part of humanity we all have... the ability to survive. The only thing I'd liked to see more so just out of my own mind...<br /><br />and be warned people SPOILER ALERT!!!!! (some what)<br /><br />When the last kill happened after that I'd like to have seen her sitting in an office with someone reading a manuscript and praising her for her work and the believability behind it, then to see her give that smile... it would have been more of a scary feel to it that she made it back to the city and pretty much confessed to these killings in a book that was going to be widely praised.<br /><br />I think over all with films like this I have to ask the question, \\"How would I react if that was me?\\" I honestly don't know I can't say I'd jump up and kill, I can't say I'd survive and I can't say I'd have been in that situation in the first place. I kept thinking I know it's idealistic to go to the woods and write and hope to crank out a best seller but at the same time... it's not smart to go to a place you don't know, alone and unarmed. I kept thinking if she had a dog and what would have happened to it. Anything I can't stand more than a rape scene is someone being cruel to animals.<br /><br />With the exception of what happens to the families of these men, as well as Jennifer herself... the movies comes not quite full circle but as close as it can. The end result is, Karma can and does come back around to bite you in the ass.hem except the mentally handicapped one... he did invoke a lot of sympathy but at the same time he still did it and she had to do what she had to do.

0439023491|5.0|***WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS*** You have been warned.<br /><br />Unintentionally a small token of appreciation (thanking the dead tributes families) becomes the spark that ignites a far spreading and fast moving wildfire that threatens life as everyone in Panem knows it to be- a rebellion against the Capitol, a rebellion that Peeta and Katniss are unprepared for, but a rebellion in which they are the key players- whether they know it or not.<br /><br />Katniss's relationship with Gale is strained as his pride and heart are wounded from watching Katniss, the girl he loves, apparently fall in love with another boy, whereas Katniss's relationship with Peeta is strained as he realizes that she was playing him the entire time in the Hunger Games, in order to ensure their survival, and does not reciprocate his feelings. However, Katniss must pretend that her relationship with Peeta is as strong as ever in order to please the president of Panem and the people during the Victory Tour of the Hunger Games, a tour in which they visit each and every district. If she is to fail to convince everyone of their live for one another, there will be hell to pay. When Katniss discovers exactly how hard this task is to complete she begins to hide within herself, showing the physical symptoms of stress (weight loss and whatnot). I'm not going to lie, while reading this portion of the book I really just wanted to pull my hair out, firstly because I thought that the story was moving at a snail's pace- I had grown accustomed to lots of action and adventure in the first novel and Katniss and Peeta dressing all fancily for dinner with important people of each district for the Victory Tour was just not doing anything for me, secondly, because of Katniss and Peeta's strained relationship- seriously on the train that they were traveling together on? I am sure that you could have cut the tension with a knife.<br /><br />When it was announced in this book that Katniss and Peeta were going to have to re-compete in the Hunger Games, my stomach dropped. I then thought to myself, \\"They can't do that to them!\\" But when it became apparent that they could and that they were going to, I was trying to think of ways that Katniss and Peeta could perhaps be exempt from the games. I came up with a bunch of unrealistic ideas and afterward I jokingly thought to myself, \\"Well, they should just play (BIG SPOILER) the pregnancy card.... They should announce to everyone of Panem that Katniss is pregnant and maybe she will not have to compete because everyone will feel sympathetic towards her.\\" When I read Peeta's little speech where he announced exactly that I could not believe it! I was just joking thinking it! I almost died laughing.<br /><br />After the initial shock of hearing that the Hunger Games were going to go down, I kinda got excited. I thought that maybe the action and adventure that I had been craving for so badly was finally going to be delivered- and boy, was it ever, and I thought that perhaps Peeta and Katniss would finally able to lose the awkwardness between them and become friends/ allies once again, and again, I was more than happy with the result.<br /><br />I loved the introduction of the new characters/ fellow Hunger Games competitors, Finnick, the overly dramatic/ overly gorgeous male who knows he is super gorgeous and flaunts it whenever possible, yet who has an extremely serious side as he is willing to risk life and limb to keep Katniss and Peeta alive, and Mags, an elderly woman who no one, save for Finnick, can understand and who also is more than willing to sacrifice herself for the greater good, and Beetee and Wiress, the super geeky, yet extremely intelligent competitors (who I believe would have won the Hunger Games hands-down had the games went on as originally planned)... Heck, I even didn't mind Johanna, who in real life I would consider to be a gigantic bimbo. But I also loved the old characters, such as Haymitch, as we saw a completely new side of him, that being when he was a competitor of the Hunger Games and I really think that knowing that helps us to understand why he is like the way he is now, and Cinna, what he did for Katniss, well, I don't think that in a million years she would be able to thank him enough. And the games themselves? They were so dramatic and kept me on my seat the whole time. I seriously hated every time I had to put the book down when reading about them...<br /><br />So all in all? Well, the first half or so may not be super thrilling/ keeps you on the edge of your seat, but the last half more than makes up for it!

0439023513|2.0|***This review contains spoilers***<br /><br />If I had to sum this book up in one word it would be confusion. Firstly, prior to reading this book I was confused as to why the reviews of this book were so black and white, with the people who completely loved this book and were happy with the outcome or with the people who are completely disappointed by this book and almost feel as if it almost wrecked the series for them. Having read it, If found that many of the characters experienced confusion within the story, take Katniss, for instance, and her concussion which makes it difficult for her to concentrate for long periods of time, or Peeta, who was tortured greatly and as a result has an extremely difficult time separating fact from fiction, or Finnick, who completely loses himself to a confused state when he mourns for the women that he loves and whom he believes to be in the clutches of evil. The first half of the book I enjoyed quite a bit and was totally like, \\"What are those haters going on about? This book is great!\\" But then all of a sudden it completely changed and I felt myself liking the book less and less. Overall, I am just confused about what actually happens in this book/ why it does and I can understand why many people take the latter side, that they are disappointed with the outcome of the book.<br /><br />When reading this book, like the others, I had no idea who Katniss was going to choose, her best friend of many years, Gale, or Peeta, the boy who did everything in his power to protect her no matter the cost to himself. And as previously mentioned in my other review of this series, I wasn't fully supporting/ rooting for one of the boys over the other, while absolutely hating the other. I liked both of them almost the same (well, that is a tad white lie, I liked one boy just a fraction more than the other, just a fraction though- nothing major, I promise!), and I thought that I was going to be completely okay with who she picked in the end. But I am not. I just hate how she didn't actually choose which boy she wanted- she didn't have an option between the boys because the other boy just left her high and dry to go be some bigshot without her (Okay, maybe I am being a bit dramatic, he did leave her because he thought that she would never be able to forgive him for something that he didn't intentionally do, but heck, Katniss forgave the other boy for doing a lot worse of things- which he seemed to constantly be doing/ doing on purpose, so I am sure that she would have eventually forgave unintentional boy). And the boy that leaves her, well I guess it is kinda insinuated when I say \\"high and dry\\" that he never has any contact with her ever again... AND COME'ON!!! How can you just leave like that?<br /><br />Another thing that kinda bugged me was just how much of a beating Katniss took in this book. I mean, we start off with her having a concussion, then she gets a bummed knee, then we find out that she has huge scarring on her arm from an earlier incident, and then she gets shot and bruises all of her ribs, AND THEN SOMETHING MAJOR HAPPENS (DUN, DUN, DUN)... Well you get the point. I won't tell you what happens to her in the end, but it isn't pretty whatsoever and it just makes me mad. I mean, I am not saying that her life should be all flowers, rainbows, and unicorns, because if it was, she wouldn't be the person we have all grown to love, but can't the girl catch a break every now and then (and I personally don't think that it as necessary whatsoever, it sure as heck didn't enhance the plot at all)? And another thing? I dislike it when a character has a concussion or something mental going on where they can not fully concentrate/ zone in and out of reality, I find it makes it extremely difficult for me to determine what is actually going on.ate how she didn't actually choose which boy she wanted- she didn't have an option between the boys because the other boy just left her high and dry to go be some bigshot without her (Okay, maybe I am being a bit dramatic, he did leave her because he thought that she would never be able to forgive him for something that he didn't intentionally do, but heck, Katniss forgave the other boy for doing a lot worse of things- which he seemed to constantly be doing/ doing on purpose, so I am sure that she would have eventually forgave unintentional boy).

006176759X|4.0|I'm not going to lie, when I first heard that Lauren Conrad was writing a book I laughed and rolled my eyes thinking, \\"Lauren Conrad?!? Lauren Conrad?!? What does she have? A degree in fashion! How is a degree in fashion supposed to help you write a book?!?\\" I mean, I loved \\"The Hills\\", it was a good little drama on MTV chronicling Lauren and her friends lives as they tried to make it in the fashion world and whatnot, but it was completely mindless (*cough, cough, Speidi anyone?*)...<br /><br />So imagine my surprise when I read her first book, \\"L.A. Candy\\" and I find that I actually quite enjoy it and she might be a pretty okay author (note pretty good author- she ain't no Rachel Vincent or Cassandra Claire- yet). And now as I write this review I really cannot think of any complaints I had of the book, well, except for the fact that it had a cliff-hanger ending- you will come to learn that I loathe cliff-hanger endings. Seriously, if I pay for the full price of a book I expect a full/ complete story to come out of it ;).<br /><br />I think that it was very successful at fulfilling its goals: appeal to young girls: check, putting the author on New York Times Best Seller List: check, increase Lauren's popularity as she was no longer going to be on \\"The Hills\\" anymore, check. And all I have to think is, \\"Good for her! Lauren has not been able to be successful as a fashion designer, reality TV star, but now as an author\\".<br /><br />And you know what? I think that I would actually recommend the book! And... *drum roll please*... I do think I will continue on with this series. Yes, yes, this is as shocking to me (who was somewhat dreading reading this book) as I am sure it is shocking to you since I am slightly bashing of \\"mindless teen girl novels\\".

0439023521|5.0|Okay, to start off with... I think that if \\"My Side of the Mountain\\" by Jean George, \\"The Uglies\\" series by Scott Westerfeld, \\"Shade's Children\\" by Garth Nix, and \\"The Giver\\" by Louis Lowry were to have a child together (don't ask me how four books could have a child together, I am not a rocket scientist, I am a mere book blogger ;) ), this book would be the result (plus with a little bit of \\"The Truman Show\\" film thrown into the genetic mixture).<br /><br />When I first picked up this book and started reading it, I noticed that the writing of the book isn't similar to anything I have ever read before. It doesn't flow quite like the girly paranormal stories I gravitate towards (ie. \\"Paranormalcy\\" and things along those lines). I find the writing to be a lot choppier and blunter, but it fits the premise of the book perfectly, since this book isn't about a happy-go-lucky society, but the epitome of a dystopian society. I'm not going to lie, I didn't adjust to this writing style until a good 30 pages into the book, but now as I read the later books in the series, I don't even notice the difference in writing.<br /><br />Usually when I read a series where a female character is torn between whether she wants to be with her best friend/ old friend who she can see herself in a relationship with because he is comfortable and safe, versus the new boy who comes into her life who is super mysterious and all, I typically root for the new boy. My philosophy...? If you haven't gotten together in all of the time that you have been friends, why now at this random point in time does he start to show an interest in you? Just because the new boy came along and he feels like he needs to stake his claim? Therefore I am quite surprised at my reaction to this book. I seriously don't know who I want Katniss to end up with... Gale or Peeta... And also, I have read tons of reviews and plot summaries of this book, but it completely escapes me who she chooses (so it's nice that it will be a complete surprise to me at the end of the series).<br /><br />Also, I am rather enjoying that all of the books are out in this series. Usually when I start a series I start when the first book is released and then I have to wait years upon years for the remaining books to be released, so it's just really nice not to have to mope around the house wondering what happens to my favourite characters (it doesn't try my patience).<br /><br />Usually I am a little iffy towards the secondary characters- a lot of the time I could take them or leave them, however, in this series I find myself liking most, if not all, of the secondary characters and think that they contribute wholeheartedly to the series, especially Haymitch Abernathy. I mean first off, he is a secondary character which is bad in my books, then he is a drunk, which is even worse in my eyes, but... I cannot help but love him. He means well and does everything in his power to protect Peeta and Katniss, so I can forgive him for all of his vices and faults, plus the man is clearly a genius. And President Coriolanus Snow? Oh gosh... This man makes me so gosh darn angry, but I wouldn't change him at all. He is the most perfect bad guy if I ever did see one and Ru? Well, her fate was probably the hardest to come to terms with- she just seemed like such a little ball of energy. Cinna? Well, I think that if he were a real life person that we would be bffl's.<br /><br />So all in all, if you like a ton of action and adventure, then this book is clearly for you. Throw in a bit of romance (but not too much/ too cheesy), a unique plot line, and you have the perfect combination for a great book!to me at the end of the series).

Man, that jukebox sure sounds good, it's got all those jump blues, rockabilly, and R&B standards in it...wait a minute, there's actually a band in there! And who's that guitar slinger? Jeff BECK? What? Is this a dream?<br /><br />No, it's not. That's all you really need to know about this disc. The hottest, most smokin' bar band you've ever heard rips it up on a killer set. Yeah, things slow down a little in the middle of the set but they're covering Les Paul & Mary Ford tunes for ¢hrissakes! Besides that's when it's time to grab another shot of whiskey or pump some coins into the cigarette machine.<br /><br />Four stars for great performances from everybody involved, all well recorded with a clean, crisp sound mix. A more extensive booklet with details about the songs, Les Paul, and the show itself would make this a five-star album.

I woke up at that point and worked on this review.<br /><br />If Sir Simon's intention at the outset was to miniaturise Haydn - one of the great symphonists - then he has succeeded admirably, assisted no end by a Berlin Philharmoniker that appears to be sponsored by Weight Watchers. Others, such as Uncle Karl in [[ASIN:B000007S7C Haydn:  Symphonies No. 88, 89, & 92 'Oxford' (Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra/Karl Boehm)]] and even Karajan in his early 1980s cycles [[ASIN:B001DCQI9Q 6 Paris Symphonies/12 London Symphonies (Box)]], have demonstrated that power and clarity can be jolly bedfellows in Haydn.  And how fussy Rattle is: does he really have to make an expressive point with every bar? The slow movement of 89, for instance, is narcissistic in the extreme. Bohm allows the music to speak for itself.<br /><br />Magic is also in short supply - witness, for example, the slow introduction to the Oxford. As the epitaph of the Ancien Regime, it should blaze with the luminescence of sunset. As rendered by Sir Simon it is exceedingly well played, superlatively recorded and as dull as dishwater. Could it be time for another tofu burger with a sprinkle of alfalfa . . . . . ..<br /><br />Oh, the sadness of it all. As much as I want to 'convert' my kids to classical music, I am embarrassed to play these performances to them in the car. One can only pray that Sir Simon is not afforded an opportunity to maul the London Symphonies. And I daresay that Mozart is on the menu . . . . .

0316789798|5.0|I bought this book for my 7-yr-old son on a whim because I saw it on Amazon, and it sparked a memory... I had this very same book when I was a kid!  I suddenly remembered it so clearly; I drew all the critters in this book.  Well, my son LOVES this book.  He carries it around with him all day.  He looks at it before he goes to sleep at night.  He draws and draws and draws.  And the remarkable thing about it is that I couldn not get him interested in art or drawing before we got this book.  Thank you Ed Emberley!
B00007GZR5|1.0|I bought this movie to give as a gift. When the gift was opened and the DVD case was opened there was no movie. By this time I had thrown the packing receipt away. I was very disappointed. This was a favorite movie for the special person I was buying it for. It turned out to be a huge disappointment for both of us.
B002ZG9968|4.0|I only give this movie four stars because of Alex O - who I could watch read the phone book he is that gorgeous and charismatic. However what is he doing? Seriously the man can act! Watch Mary Bryant or Oyster Farmer or his turn on The Shield. Yet he is doing stuff like this! It kind of makes me sad.    I give it four stars because he is as gorgeous as you can get in it and funny too but the rest of it! The birthing pool scene was gross. I really hope that he has a plan - a back up plan ha ha - so that he can take all the money from these sorts of misfires and put it towards his production company and make some interesting stuff. I have not doubt he really could be amazing but I remember once in an interview him saying he was only mediocre or some such. Perhaps a lack of confidence is why he is doing this sort of thing instead of holding out for something better? Or maybe an actor has to take what he/she can get in the hard faced world of Hollywood?     I actually think Alex could have a career like Johnny Depp if he wanted - playing off key different roles where his perfect looks don't pigeon hole him. Because he really does seem to have some real depth to him.    As for J-Lo I am not her biggest fan but I don't dislike her either. I quite liked the Wedding Planner for cheesey fun. And I really enjoyed Enough - like a top notch True Movie that film was. But again she isn't on top form here and as her top form is only okay it drags the film down.     I really wanted to love this and I didn't and I just keep getting flashbacks to the earlier work of Alex O and hoping he goes back to his roots at some point.
B001UREJYK|2.0|Could have been such a great movie, such interesting people involved, great story, instead we get a typically inane, over-simplified cliche-saturated Hollywood pile of ..... I did like the lighting and the visuals quite a bit myself, as well as the actors playing the English golfers and the lead character's parents, hence the 2 stars. The rest of the acting and the script and direction was high-school caliber at best in my opinion. Shia La Boeuf (not sure of the spelling) could not have been a worse choice---seemed like the male hero of a movie made for kids, and bore no resemblance in any way to the man his character was based on. Real disappointment for me---i was really looking forward to this.
B003UESJFG|1.0|I took my kids ages 6, 3, and 1 to see this at the theater.  We were all really enjoying this well made movie right up until the climax when the villain looks right at the camera and says \\"THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS THE TOOTH FAIRY!\\".  My kids looked at me with tears in their eyes and I had a lot of backpedaling and explaining to do after the movie.  I can not understand why they would put a line of dialogue like that in a kid's movie.

0316044695|1.0|I enjoyed reading this book. The political agenda put me off some. They were sent to assasinate a high ranking taliban member, but hesitated killing a couple of goatherds because of how the \\"liberal press\\" would portray it. I suppose the \\"liberal Press\\" would have no problem with the assasination though huh? They let the goatherds compromise the mission. Somehow that doesn't ring true. Oh well, we only have the word of the Lone Survivor. If you can get past the political agenda, it's a good read.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|I went into this movie not knowing what to expect, for the most part Bruce Willis is great at whatever role he plays in whatever movie, From Diehard series to the whole nine yards to the sixth sense to movies like Red he can play in any type of movie. This was a great movie solely because it was an action movie with a comedy storyline and the cast that performed it was exceptional. I would highly recommened this film to anyone youll love the action atmosphere and parts with the comedy roles, the chemisty between Bruce Willis and Mary Louise Parker is amazing really makes the movie. Blu Ray or DVD, Its a comedy role movie but its all about the action behind the comedy theirs tons of shootouts explosions and some fighting, youll want the blu ray for this movie, its much better for action movies and this can be considered one. Enjoy the movie hope this review helped.
0316098337|5.0|I admit it was difficult to get past the fact that this book is written the way a 5 yr old thinks, but the situation is so interesting that I kept going. Now halfway through the book, I'm used to it. I've been reading this book until I fall asleep. Sometimes I wake up a minute later and keep reading because I have to find out what happens next. Without spoiling the book for you, I can tell you that what I thought about the boy's \\"situation\\" has turned out to be very different, and much more gripping. If you want a good book to get absorbed in, get this one.
B001FB55YE|5.0|I think guy ritchie did an amazing job on this movie, It is a genuine Guy Ritchie British Gangster type film. If youve seen his other work Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels or Snatch (two of my other favorite movies) you'll know what im talking about. This one is just as good as the other ones. The cast and storyline are amazing. I would highly recommened if you know Guy Ritchie and are a fan of his work with these type of movies that you go check this out. Id say buy it but if your a total skeptic rent it first see how you feel its worth the view. If purchasing defanitly go with Blu Ray on this one the HD picture and sound is highly appriciated and makes a significant difference with this film. Hope this helps, enjoy the movie if you see it.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I fell in love with her album 19, and have been blown away by her performances.  But 21 is absolutely amazing and a joy to listen to.  I love Rolling In the Deep, but after a couple of listens to the rest of the music, He Won't Go is now my favorite song ever! I am wearing out my music player and disc player in my car with this record. I bought the album because of Rolling In The Deep, but I was caught completely by the rest of the album! If doubt about what good music is please purchase, find a place of solitude, and enjoy. You will be reminded what music is suppose to be. I promise you won't be disappointed! Cheers!!! I am off to listen again. Where's the repeat button!
B002ZG99NG|5.0|Most of the time when it comes to Ben Affleckhe delivers a great performancein whatever type of movie hes in whether its drama, comedy, suspense, action, thriller ect. This movie is not different its action, drama, suspense all in one. Its about a group of friends who rob banks in Mass. The two standout performances in my view Go to Ben Affleck and Jeremy Renner, their roles were very in depth emotionally and they delivered on the roles. Ben Affleck's character falls for a girl whom was involved in one of the robbery, he begins to feel remorse,saddness, regret and anger sorrounding the events hes partaken in. This was one of the best movies ive seen in regards to an Affleck film. When It comes down to it I highly recommened this movie to anyone, I feel they will be surprised and amused by it. At points it will get your emotions going whether sad, angry, nervous for the characters you really get into it. Go Blu Ray with this movie over dvd the shooting, chase and all around sound and picture will suit the film better on it. Enjoy the movie it really is must see in alot of respects and I hope this review did it justice and helps you guys out when choosing to view it or not.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|I love this book, especially because is a very fun and ligth reading. And sometimes I felt such a connection with Emma, the main character, that even when it's no a deep book you do feel touched by the story. So if you're looking something to read just to laugh and have a nice time, this is your book :).
B0029F21BA|5.0|This is a Clint Eastwood directred Drama, Mystery film, It could be considered action or gang like at some points but I wouldnt loop it in those genres. It has an allstar cast with a strong performance and no weak links. When Sean Penns oldest daughter is murdered Sean Penn's Character the angered and depressed dad tries to figure out whom the killer is before the police can to try and claim justice for his daughter in the way his eyes see fit. I highly recommened this film It goes deep into the emotions of the characters, the storyline is deep and will get you deeply into it. Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne play the strongest roles in this film. They portray their characters very well and as I said no weak performances. Blu Ray or DVD on most films if you have a HD LCD or LED TV id say blu ray just because the picture and sound is far superior to dvd and standard tv. This film has alot of details and moments where you will want high def so you dont miss anything, heavy details easily detected on blu ray. Enjoy the film I hope you see it, it really is a great movie. Hope this review helped.

B002HK9I04|5.0|If your a fan of the South Park series youll enjoy the movie very much, it's hilarious, disgusting, ridiculous everything love from the show in a movie that goes past the limits of the show. So that being said if you havent seen the movie yet but are a fan of the show I would Recommened it Highly, When Buying or Renting this film I'd have to say Blu Ray with this animated film makes a huge difference the movie is 100% clearer picture and sound wise and youll truely appriciate the upgrade. Some animation films look the same on blu ray as they do dvd but this one delivers on blu ray. Hope this helps.
B002I9Z8DK|3.0|I have been an avid Star Trek TOS fan from the time it was on TV in the 1960's.  I have kept up with the movies, and have enjoyed them all, even Star Trek - The Motion Picture.  I am not the kind of fan that memorizes everything. But I do remember what I see! Star Trek 6 - The Undiscovered Country was a very fitting end to the TOS franchise.  The actors have aged very well, and the movie aluded to that fact with the \\"... in three months the crew will retire\\".      I got the movie in VHS, then I got the collectors edition DVD.  I watch it a lot, and enjoyed it.  When the blu-ray version was released, I thought that it would be a lot of fun to see it in this mode.  Imagine my suprise when I see that the movie from the collectors edition was not the movie on the blu-ray.  MANY scenes are missing.  A lot of pertinent dialogue is gone.  I have read in reviews that this is the theatrical version.  I do not know about that, but I know scenes are missing that were on the VHS copy!  One very important part of the dialogue is Spock and Volaris debating that Vulcans never lie.  Many times she will say to Spock, \\" a lie?\\" and he says things like, \\"an error\\", \\" an ommision\\"  etc.  Then when she is \\"found out\\" she says she doesn't remember.  Spock say \\" a lie?\\" and she says \\" a choice\\".  Without the previous dialogue, this exchange has no meaning.  There are missing scenes in the presidents office, on the Enterprise during the investigation, and the most glaring, the discovery that the Klingon asassin is real Col West.  It is one of Michael Dorn's best scene.  (Michael Dorn is Worf on Next Gen)    What I do not understand about this blu ray edition is, and I have read this about other Star Trek Blu-Ray editions, if the blue ray disc can hold SO MUCH MORE information, WHY ARE THE MOVIES THE SHORTER AND LESS IMPRESSIVE VERSIONS????    While the extras are good, and the quality is great, haveing the shorter version is a real dissapointment.  Maybe I am old fashioned, but I buy the disc for the movie, not the extras.  If you skimp on the movie, what good are the extras?  Maybe Paramount will release Collector's Editions on blu ray.  Those I would buy.  If you are a Star Trek movie buff, and are not in it for the \\"extras\\", I would pass on this edition, and view the DVD collectors edition.  Much better ride, and it still looks good on an HD TV!
B000LPS4BG|5.0|Theres not much to review here, Goodfellas is in my opinion anyways one of the best films ever directed and produced, the chemistry between Ray Liotta, Robert Dinero and Joe Pesci is amazing and they pull off an amazing storyline. I obviously would recommend this film to anybody whose into the Gangster action films and hasnt seen the movie. I love the fact its on Blu Ray now, The moment I saw it on the shelf i picked it up and bought it. the sound and picture quality is top notch and does wonders for this film regardless of its the graphics of the whole movie, the fight scenes that take place, the drug scenes or the shooting scenes all look great, crystal clear. I Highly recommened this movie and buying it on blu ray, you wont be dissapointed. Enjoy hope this helped.
B004I2K4DY|4.0|I love Les Misrables.  I loved the 10th Anniversary Edition. There's only really one thing I'd like to add to the other reviews.  We felt that the videography, lighting, and filming quality was inferior to the 10th Anniversary show.  The videographers spent too much time on distace scenes where we, like the audience, watched the close-ups on the screens above the actual performers.  Kind of bummer.
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|This Is probably my Favorite Clint Eastwood directed film. his 3 best In my view are Gran Torino, Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby. This movie takes place in Michigan in a highly hmung or oriental populated area of Detroit. Its deeply emotional and will get you involved. It gets into how the cities male demographic go to jail showing they think crime is the only way to get by and some find it cool. It revolves around a pretty biast clint eastwood and his relationship with a neighborhood teen Tao. After Tao steals his car Eastwood or his character Walt takes his offer and makes him work for him. At first walt dislikes tao but they grew into having a friendship. Its a deeply emotional film that requires your full attention. I highly recommened this film to anyone in search of a great movie view, you will not be disapointed. Blu Ray or DVD again go blu ray the picture and sound in hd bring out details in the film that the dvd doesnt and that you wont want to miss. Hope you enjoy the movie as most did i guarentee you atleast enjoy the view if your dont love the movie. Hope this review helped.

Its scary, brutal, gory, suspensful and fun to watch. Id highly recommend this movie to anyone whose a fan of the action, thriller genres. Go blu ray over dvd the effects and sounds are well worth it on the blu ray.  enjoy the movie, hope this helped.
B004IXFGZO|5.0|Yanni makes its big return, the persons who waited for a new instrumental album is going to be under the spell of Truth Of Touch and for those who have the nostalgia for the present singers on Yanni Voices have no anxiety because they will be also present (Leslie Mills, Chloe and Nathan Pacheco)  This album keeps the authenticity of the ancient compositions while bringing a new fresher and more modern atmosphere, with a mixture of electro music and guitar gives a dynamism that we find in particular in Vertigo.  The key pieces being Truth Of Touch, Season, Nine, gives a sweetness which makes travel our spirit as well as our senses by the sensualism of the voice of Leslie Mills interpreting Can' t Wait. We shall not forget to note the magnificent performance of Nathan Pacheco with O Luce Che Brilla Nell' Obscurita and the album ends by a voice of siren on Secret interpreted by Chloe.    We can so conclude that the magic of talented Greek Yanni has still struck our hearts, leaving us dreamer while waiting for the next marvels which reserves us this talented musician still if can known in France.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|I hear alot of people bash this movie and all their reasons are babble, Stallone set out to make a Tribute to 80s action movies. This movie did a great job with that, People think it was meant to a 5 star blockbuster movie when it wasnt meant to be anything like that. It was meant to be an 80s action movie tribute which is cheap storyline, girl or 2, blood, fighting, explosions....thats it. Stallone for the most part had a good cast Stallone and Statham did a great job with their roles as did Jet Li. I dont think Couture or crews needed to be in this as much as some other stars, norris, segal ect. Austin plays a great heel and Dolph Lundgren gets my acting award/notice for his role as gunnar he did an amazing job playing the druggy mercenary, he was the tweener or neither bad nor good guy, he played both. The last thing I would of changed would be Willis and swartzenager deserve longer roles. especially willis along with stallone, statham and lundgren hes an action legend. Would I recommened this film? Yes I recommened it to open minded people who go into it thinking its a tribute to 80s action, not recommeneded who think Stallone was trying to make a 5 star blockbuster, This movie does a great job showing the brotherhood of the group and the emotion of the memebers. In the end I say see it I loved it im sure with knowing what its meant to be you will as well. Blu Ray or dvd, on this movie defanitly go with the Blu Ray as all action movies its much better picture and sound quality on blu ray youll enjoy the fights and explosions much more on blu. hope this helps enjoy.

1600108512|5.0|I'm a lifelong fan of Peter Beagle, \\"The Last Unicorn\\" book and movie.  I must have watched the movie a thousand times as a kid, and read and reread the novel as a teen and young adult.  This graphic novel is just one more way to celebrate a splendid and imagination stirring story.  Those of us who love the film and book know that it's a story we can revisit over and over again, always moved by what Beagle is trying to say.  It's lovely to see a new way for kids and adults alike to fall in love with this precious tale.  I'm not really worried about the parts the graphic novel (or movie) left out as opposed to the actual book.  My feeling is that once you fall in love with the story, you'll want to experience it in all its forms.  I'm just glad I have one more way to share this beloved book with my own children one day.  This story is such a part of my own memories of childhood ... and I'll support and love any of Beagle's offerings with joy because of that gift.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|We love Star Wars.  We love it, as we remember seeing it in the theaters.  The Special Editions were fun.  I have them.  I don't want them on Blu-Ray.  Want to include them alongside the original versions, fine, but don't ignore your fans.  By ignoring them, you are caving in to your worst instincts as an entertainer and as an artist, to do your art for you, and you alone, and that is a very sad state of affairs.    Releasing the original, uncut, restored versions on Blu ray would be a love letter to all your fans.  A thank you note for putting you on the map as a director and one of the foremost science fiction writers of the 20th and 21st Centuries.  We did together.  You worked hard and we ate it up, seeing the movie several times in the theaters, buying every version, whenever you released it, on every format.  Now that Blu-Ray is up the task and you are still alive and able to work on it, commit to us that you will do what we ask.  Please.  We are in no position to demand it, but we are in a position to respectfully request it.    Thanks in advance.  Lifelong Star Wars fan.

B002NPY7E0|5.0|This is the ultimate film noir, not only in visual style, with shadows, venetian blinds and ceiling fans, but in a tour de force of evil and shady characters. And there's even more: this one adds southern voodoo with Faustian pact to the recipe, so the film is beyond hommage and beyond noir; it's actually DARK, not just film noir on the trail of The Maltese Falcon, The Big Sleep or the previous effort in that genre, Body Heat, only this one does not bother to offer the usual femme fatale as in the mentioned examples.   It's odd how De Niro's Louis Ciphre, despite the long nails, looks a lot more composed and elegant than Mickey Rourke's Harry Angel, a detective who keeps detecting his own past and who looks increasingly dirty, sweaty, undone and badly dressed as the movie progresses, so that by the end, he looks almost like a homeless man, perhaps so as to enhance the down on his luck feel of his character. His performance is superb, even better than De Niro's and the celebrated egg eating scene.  The copy in blu-ray is also beautiful and impeccable, probably even better than the one I originally saw in cinemas back in 1987, when it was released, doing Michael Seresin's photography justice.  A masterpiece of a man's journey through and to hell, with freshly new, evil characters and not just the obvious femme fatales and greedy low lifes that parade on endless examples of the genre.

0132350882|2.0|Because I am passionate about coding, I expected to love \\"Clean Code\\", by Robert Martin.  I've heard Martin speak on software development, and he is terrific.  If you ever get the chance to listen to a presentation by him, do not miss it.  Likewise, Martin's articles and essays are excellent, even ground-breaking.  Many should be required reading for anyone who styles him or herself as a programmer, developer or software engineer.<br /><br />Perhaps it was the curse of high expectations, but I found this book to be a disappointment.<br /><br />The book is apparently a joint effort.  Some of the chapters by other authors seemed a bit light.  In particular, the only notable recommendation from chapter 11, \\"Systems,\\" is to consider aspect-oriented architecture.  Not only is this an unrealistic option for most developers, but for those of us not implementing application frameworks, it is probably a very bad idea.  This chapter also cavalierly dismisses the strategy of lazy evaluation as a \\"little, convenient idiom\\", and should be avoided so that there can be a clear separation between construction and implementation tasks.  In my experience, no one considers lazy evaluation unless forced to by circumstances (e.g., order of class initialization; performance considerations for interactive systems, etc.).  Certainly separation of object creation and execution is a worthy goal, but sometimes requirements get in the way of ideals.<br /><br />For the most part, Martin's specific recommendations for improving code are solid and should be followed, but there are several that strike me as wrong-headed.  For example, for the sake of reducing visual clutter, Martin advises us to forego using the keyword \\"final\\" in variable and class declarations, and goes on to say that his unit tests should detect any errors that the final keyword would have prevented.  The problem with this argument is that it could excuse any number of bad programming practices; in my opinion we're better off using \\"final\\" and living with the clutter.<br /><br />On a more minor issue, I was disappointed to see that Martin has changed his mind on vertically aligning variables and expressions.  My experience is that this practice makes code much more readable.  In fact, I had some difficulty picking through his unaligned code to find variable names.<br /><br />Also, unlike Martin, I think that some minimal encoding of type in a variable name is helpful - I like to be able to differentiate scalar values from objects at a glance.<br /><br />Another surprise is Martin's claim that the optimal length of a method is a single line.  In most cases, this is just wrong: with the exception of \\"getters\\" or obvious translations between the problem-space and solution-space (e.g., \\"bool noIssuesArePending()  { return issueList.empty();}\\"), I find it incredibly confusing to dig down to one method only to find a one-liner referring me to another.<br /><br />Sadly, it is not just in minor areas that the book disappoints.  Perhaps its greatest flaw is that Martin's example of well-written code violates his own imperatives (viz., to the extent possible, the purpose of a routine or program should be clear, so much so that the implementation seems simple and natural, perhaps even trivial).  As I dug through Martin's code (and it required digging), the main question I kept asking was what on earth was going on, and what function the various subroutines could be doing.  It was a program that I had to read end-to-end three times before I could understand any individual method, which would bode poorly for code maintenance.<br /><br />Appendix A, on concurrency, is another serious disappointment.  Well into it the author, Bruce Schuchert, states that for a program with two steps (S1 and S2), concurrently executed by two threads, the possible sequences of operations include (S1, S2, S2, S1).<br /><br />This is wrong; that sequence is impossible.  If a thread executes S1 and the next executed step isS2 then step S2 must have been executed by the same thread.  At that point, the only possible way to end the sequence is for the other thread to complete S1 and then S2.<br /><br />After I found this error, it hard to work up much enthusiasm for slogging through the remainder of the chapter. I understand<br />that a book without errors is probably as rare as a bug-free program, but this seems like an unfortunate mistake to appear in an in-depth treatment of threading.  (For a correct analysis of the surprising variety of ways that two threads can execute a program with two steps, see \\"The Art of Concurrency,\\" by Clay Breshears, Chapt. 3, Figure 3-1.)<br /><br />If you are serious about coding (and you would not be reading this if you weren't), then \\"Clean Code\\" is probably worth a skim, but it is by no means the book I had hoped it would be.S2 then step S2 must have been executed by the same thread.  At that point, the only possible way to end the sequence is for the other thread to complete S1 and then S2.<br /><br />After I found this error, it hard to work up much enthusiasm for slogging through the remainder of the chapter.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Fabulous read for those who love history, libraries and fantasy. There are few books that I wish would never end and this was definitely one of them. I loved the story line, the characters and the way that it left off. Perfect opening for the next installment of the trilogy.  Deborah Harkness has made my \\"favorite Author list\\".
B002ZG99TA|5.0|I had hesitated to see this movie thinking it couldn't be that exciting to watch 1.5 hours of a runaway train, but I was WRONG! I can't wait to see it again and have my wife watch.  Very well done and D.W. & C.P. have great chemistry in this suspense-packed movie. I researched the true event in Ohio in 2001; comments were that it followed closely to the real-life happening. Watch it...
B000002KO3|5.0|This came out in 80' and it stands as one of the best rock albums from that decade. It's somewhat impossible to describe. Let's just say if you mixed the seemingly incongruous music styles of Velvet Underground, Kraftwork, Parliament Funkadellic, King Crimson with the impenetrable lyric style of Yes and Steely Dan you might start to come close to a description. Adventurous art rock at it's best in the decade that basically killed it off. At times it's danceable art rock, there's a rare combination
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I am extremely picky when it comes to music. I seek out the best of the best to fill up my arsenal of audio goodies. Florence + The Machine came upon me just a few months ago. I really love \\"Cosmic Love\\" and \\"Drumming Song\\"...during a month away from home I started exploring her other songs and WOW has this girl pulled me in. Beautiful, sweeping songs filled with drama and emotion yet still catchy enough to float along in the mainstream. This artist has a VERY bright future.
B0042KZJ46|5.0|I've been waiting for this album for almost 30 years!<br />I loved \\"Live\\" and \\"Babylon by bus\\" and I always wondered why there never came more livealbums. But \\"he who waits for something good never waits too long\\"!<br />It was with an eerie feeling I listened to the album. Knowing what had happened in New York just a few days earlier it is truly incredible that Bob managed to perform this show at all. The Stanley Theatre show is the ultimate proof of Bob's devotion to both Rastafari and his audience/fans. The presence and urgency in Bob's voice is both uplifting and deeply disturbing.<br />I've heard several bootleg-versions of this concert, but none has even come close when it comes to soundquality. The tracklist includes all the great songs in versions showing Bob and the Wailers at the peak of their live-performance power.

Showing sex scene after sex scene just slows the real theme of the show down. Yes, I know the Romans enjoyed orgies to an even greater extent than Charlie Sheen but a quick pan of the camera to show everyone cavorting, maybe a five second shot, and let us get back to the main story line.     I would say that maybe these sex scenes are in there to appeal to teenagers but today's teenagers can get on the Internet and find all the X-rated stuff they want. They can go to school and usually find all the sex they want. We don't need to waste time with television shows and movies prolonging these scenes.     Now we adults who are married can have sex just about any time we want so we don't need to watch it during a good show. Or we can have sex if we are living with a person. We can have --- in real life --- any kind of sex we want just about any time we want.     So much for my rant.     \\"Spartacus\\" is filmed in a unique way with blood splattering artistry. The battle scenes are spectacular and the story, while similar to countless others, is well handled.     In short, I am enjoying it.

B0041KKYEW|4.0|Black Swan, like many of Darren Aronofsky's other films, is a story that thrives on symbolism ranging from colors and shapes to shadows and terror. It is more reminiscent of his grittier works like The Wrestler or Requiem for a Dream rather than the somber and gorgeous The Fountain.    Black Swan is an entire retelling of Swan Lake as performed by the character of Nina mastered by Natalie Portman. Nina is a victim of a pressured perfection brought on by her mother, Erica (Barbara Hershey). At the same time Thomas (Vincent Cassel), Swan Lake's artistic director, and Lily (Mila Kunis) are pushing our protagonist towards a darker path to which she never recovers from. We witness Nina's transformation as it's brilliantly crafted between her real life and that of Swan Lake.    Director Darren Aronofsky has the tendency of transforming actors and actresses into something out of their norm. When watching Requiem for a Dream, Marlon Wayans is now Tyrone Love suffering as a tragic character. In The Fountain, Hugh Jackman has become Tom Creo traveling to Xibalba. If I didn't know any better, I'd say Aronofsky has something to do with the fact that I've yet to see either actors top their respective roles.    Natalie Portman continues the trend as she plays a changing Nina, two characters of her personality. She is the frail, yet cowardly Swan Queen, but she is also the jealous seductress known as the Black Swan. Portman goes through a psychological battle that results in a completely new type of victim. The audience has the privilege of savoring every moment, every tug and rip. Natalie Portman is truly what a \\"Best Actress\\" of 2010 consists of.  Mila Kunis is Lily, our symbolic Black Swan. Time and time again, Lily is an obstacle to Nina's role of the Swan Queen and the Black Swan. She is a threat to the false sense of love between Nina and Thomas, the prince of our personal Swan Lake. Lily is the corruption inside of Nina as shown by the dangerous lifestyle and her darker wardrobe.  Vincent Cassel dominates as the manipulative, yet brilliant, Thomas. His intimacy with Nina is scary as we are introduced to his previous pet project played by an impressive cameo from Winona Ryder. Whenever he is showcased in his own familiar surroundings, Thomas is engulfed in a black and white world. He is two calculating extremes that are rarely in the center or gray. Still, Thomas is a ballet mastermind as the end result that is the true Black Swan is nothing short of perfection.  Each and every character is a unique stepping-stone for Nina as she crosses the boundaries of the human psyche.    The presentation is the only portion of Black Swan that slightly suffers. The CGI used in some scenes added to the psychological terror with subtle hints. Never have paintings in a room that move on their own been used more effectively. Other times it took one away from the experience by trying to do too much on such a tight budget. We don't have to see Nina's skin change as drastically or as often as it was portrayed. The special effects were my one disappointment as I've seen Darren Aronofsky pull off some hefty visuals with smaller budgets. Less is more sometimes.    It is a mint blemish in an otherwise thrilling film. The characters, the themes, and the music are what carry us on the excursion. The scenes are crafted in such a way that I'm reminded of some of the more powerful scenes in Amadeus. When there is a pivotal scene in Black Swan, the music thunders just like a spot on ballet performance.    It is Swan Lake, a realistic version of it. We hear parts of the actual Swan Lake musical in the story and we see the symbolic defeats and triumphs. The scenery's lighting changes under a darker context over time. Stunning backgrounds provide more than enough clues of foreshadowing.    Darren Aronofsky has topped 2008's The Wrestler with a film that is raw in emotion and fright. While The Fountain still holds as my favorite film of all time, Black Swan still performs an intense and seductive story. Black Swan is the dark corruption that finally overtakes everyone at times. It is the freedom found in the end of a tragic and near perfect rendition of Swan Lake.
B002ZG976U|4.0|BURLESQUE is a mixed bag.<br /><br /> The musical numbers, which look like they could have been staged by the late Bob Fosse, are plentiful and fabulous, filled with a spectacular, sexy razzle-dazzle.  When they are on stage, strutting and singing their stuff, neither Christina Aguilera nor Cher disappoint.  They are terrific.<br /><br /> The problems with the film, written and directed by Steven Antin, occur when the actors are not singing or dancing.<br /><br /> The screenplay is rather trite and the performances, with the exceptions of Stanley Tucci, as the nightclub's gay, sharp-witted stage manager, and Kristen Bell, as the club's hard-drinking lead dancer, are dull.  Despite the fact that she screwed up the \\"Star Spangled Banner,\\" Ms. Aguilera should keep her night job.<br /><br /> For the record, the story deals with an Ohio girl (Aguilera) who travels to Hollywood to make good as an entertainer.  She maneuvers herself into a waitress job at a hot nightclub, Burlesque, owned by Cher and her ex-husband (Peter Gallagher), which is a stone's throw from being foreclosed upon by the bank.  Soon, Christina has not only become the star of the floor show, but she is also being romanced by a ruthless businessman (Eric Dane), who wants to buy Burlesque, so that he can tear it down and build a high rise condo on the land, as well as her \\"best friend,\\" a young bartender/wannabe songwriter (Cam Gigandet).<br /><br /> Guess which one she winds up with while devising a plan to save the club?<br /><br /> Alan Cumming is also, very briefly, in the movie, but his one big number was cut from the theatrical release.  However, it is viewable in the deleted scenes section of the DVD.  Other extras include audio commentary by Antin, an alternate opening and a blooper reel.<br /><br />© Michael B. Druxman

0385532458|4.0|I've read (or listened to) every John Grisham book that has been published.  I can remember reading The Firm, then A Time to Kill.  Each succeeding novel, though perhaps not entirely original, was nevertheless entertaining and plausible.  Once Grisham attained superstar status, however, the content began to change.  It was no longer necessary to write a compelling or enjoyable novel in order to sell books; his name alone did that.  Now, Grisham could use his name to advance his political agenda and he has done so with a vengeance.<br /><br />Everything is now black and white in Grisham's world.  There is no room for interpretation, compromise or misunderstanding.  You are either as pure as the driven snow or as evil as Lucifer.  If you are a corporation, you are greedy, conniving, criminal beyond redemption.  There is no limit to how far you will stoop to poison, defraud or murder your innocent victim, as long as there is a dollar in it for you or your accomplices.<br /><br />If you are a criminal defendant, it goes without saying that you are innocent.  You are faced with police and prosecutors who are not only inept and laughably incompetent, but invariably crooked and criminal.<br /><br />Now, it is entirely Grisham's right to publish anything he wants, to oppose the death penalty and to despise police, prosecutors, conservative judges and businessmen.  Some would applaud his activism and his willingness to fight for what he believes.  And it is my right to observe that the quality of his novels and my enjoyment of his work have declined with his conversion to sainthood.  His writing lacks subtlety and his sneering and condescending tone (most glaring in The Innocent Man, a polemic on the death penalty posing as a non-fiction work) do not make for compelling reading in my opinion.  In this respect, Grisham is marginalizing himself in much the same way as political writers and commentators named Beck and Limbaugh.<br /><br />All of that to say that I found Ford County to be refreshing break in Grisham's slide from entertaining novelist to political hack.  It is a collection of short stories centered upon Clanton, Mississippi, the locale for Grisham's first novel, A Time to Kill.  Each story is a take on an aspect of small town life in the rural south, all very entertaining and enlightening.  It reminded me of the Grisham I used to enjoy prior to his conversion from novelist to political activist.ak in Grisham's slide from entertaining novelist to political hack.

B004DK49DW|1.0|I have always heard about SD and I remember that punk rock flick they were in many years ago. So even though I haven't heard much of their music over the years I decided to buy their new cd. I ignored all the statements that said this wasn't very good or that it wasn't the same as other SD records, I thought a band like this deserved my cash and the best way to make sure they get paid is to buy the new album.<br />Well, they got paid and I got a mediocre....well less than mediocre cd out of the deal.<br />I can't speak for any other Social Distortion album but this one, and this one is a bunch of well, it's not punk and that's fine but..<br />Ok these are a bunch of boring lackluster rock songs, it sounds lazy and dull.<br />When the first song started I felt excited and then after that it was one poorly written mid-tempo rocker after another.<br /><br />I'm sure I will check out one of their older albums soon but I highly recommend you listen to the sample before you buy this.
B000HSIEPI|5.0|House of Cards, a BBC production done at the time of Margaret Thatcher's downfall, is one of the best modern political intrigue/satires done. The cast, the story, and the exacting attention to detail make this a piece worth watching and re-watching, to see what details escaped notice the first time.<br /><br />The Plot<br />As the story opens, Thatcher has just resigned. There is a brief glimpse of an inner-party election for a new leader, and the moderate, middle candidate Henry Collingridge wins the post, and proceeds to barely win the next General Election. Almost immediately following this event, tempers begin to flare as Urqhart is denied the promotion he had sought, and is disgusted with Collingridge's 'politics as usual' stance.<br /><br />Francis Urqhart, Conservative Party whip and functionary, with the unwitting assistance of a junior political reporter Mattie Storin, and the manipulated support of party functionary Roger O'Neill, sets out to undo the Prime Minister, involving the PM in scandals that rock his fragile majority and ever-loosening grip on power. Ultimately, Urqhart's schemes against Collingridge bring the PM down, and the stage is set for another leadership election.<br /><br />Urqhart, at the urging of his wife Elizabeth, works toward the leadership and works toward solidifying the loyalties of his minions, who include the ruffian Tim Stamper, an associate whip in the Commons, and Benjamin Landless, a newspaper proprietor. However, it is in making Storin his bedroom partner and virtual worshipper that Urqhart has his strongest support; this support is not absolute, something he recognises. This relationship is done with the blessing, nay, with the urging, of his wife Elizabeth.<br /><br />Urqhart uses his inside knowledge to make short work of all but the top contenders for the job, and then casts his lot for the job at the last moment, splitting the ticket. Knocking one contender against another one final time, Urqhart carries the election. However, O'Neill is unstable and unsure of the propriety of his dealings in bringing down Collingridge, and Storin realises at the last moment that she has been a pawn in a master political chess game. O'Neill's cocaine problem leads to his demise, as Urqhart plants poison in his drugs and permits O'Neill's nature to do him in. Storin discovers this murder plot, and confronts Urqhart, who confesses, but then proceeds to throw Mattie Storin bodily from the roof of the House of Commons.<br /><br />But, there was a tape recorder running, setting the stage for the sequel...<br /><br />`To Play the King' is the sequel, in which Urqhart matches forces against the newly installed King, played by Michael Kitchen. The King sees himself as the champion of the underdog and underclass Urqhart has abandoned, and it is a literal battle royale to the end. Storin has been replaced by Sarah Harding, who finds Urqhart is more than a match for her minor turncoating as well.<br /><br />Finally, `The Final Cut' brings things full circle, as Urqhart beats Thatcher's record of unbroken days in office. However, his lust for power drives him into reckless foreign affairs, and his wife comes into her own with scheming beyond measure.<br /><br />The Cast<br />Ian Richardson is masterful as Urqhart, the scheming blackheart Chief Whip/Prime Minister. His voice, his subtle inflections and tones are perfect for the subtext in the words he speaks. His sidewise glances and knowing expressions to camera as the action plays out is worth far more than any words. He is a perfect snobbish, upper-class politico who considers political office as patrician right, and despises pretenders to the role.<br /><br />Diane Fletcher is superb as Elizabeth Urqhart, the equally manipulative wife. She is under utilised in this part of the trilogy, coming into her own as a character and an actress in later parts of the trilogy. One gets the strong sense of muted ambition and greed, but not amorality or power for power's sake from her, a distinction hard to play out on video. Fletcher succeeds beautifully.<br /><br />Susannah Harker plays Mattie Storin, the troubled, intelligent and inexperienced journalist who falls for Urqhart. Her psychological instability and intelligence are played beautifully. Harker can make quite a statement just with the movements of her eyes, making her a good counterpoint to Richardson.<br /><br />Miles Anderson plays the drug addict/party operative Roger O'Neill, doing a good job at playing the cad, the coward, and the fearful go-along with Urqhart's schemes. A rat trapped, O'Neill is at the breaking point, and Anderson plays this admirably.<br /><br />Perhaps the best secondary roles were performed by Alphonsia Emmanuel, who plays O'Neill's assistant and lover Penny Guy, and James Villiers, who plays Charles Collingridge, the deposed Prime Minister's troubled brother. Their roles shine brilliantly despite the relative lack of screen time.<br /><br />One gets the impression that everyone in British politics is brilliant and troubled. Well, the truth would be about half that.<br /><br />The Play's the Thing...<br />This production, in writing and execution, is full of Shakespearean nuances. There are indirect and direct references to Richard III, and Urqhart is a Machiavellian manipulator in the Duke of Gloucester's image, recast for modern dress and situation, complete with stage whispers and asides to audience. The depth of the characters, while still remaining caricatures, is fascinating. Perhaps the best-known line for a while was Urqhart's attempts to get information out to the journalist Storin without actually telling her, and being guilty (by the letter of the law) for leaks and disclosures. She would hint and speculate, at which Urqhart would reply, `You might very well think that. I of course couldn't possibly comment.'<br /><br />John Major used this response in one of his own question-time exchanges, a use that was appreciated by the Members on both sides of the House.<br /><br />Conclusions<br />For those who know nothing of British politics, this is actually a fascinating way to learn. For those who take an interest in British politics, this provides an intriguing fictional tale that is, in many ways, so close to reality on so many levels as to be positively unnerving.<br /><br />Richardson rightly won BAFTA awards for his portrayal of Urqhart in each of the three installments, House of Cards and its sequels To Play the King and The Final Cut.

6300263673|5.0|I received the product and it was in excellent condition. I also received it before the date told in e-mail to receive it. I had ordered this for a friend of mine who does not have on line . She was thrilled that I could get it. Thank you so much for the prompt and quick action.
B0021L8V0W|2.0|I'm getting tired of these Hollywood concoctions which consist of 40 min weak storyline and 60 min of silly cgi fighting. This could have been much better if it where at least a little realistic.
B000W00FE4|5.0|What a wonderful sonic experience this album is.  It is a bit on the seedy side, but it works well.  It's 80's synth-pop bliss!!  Worth the price for \\"Say Hello, Wave Goodbye\\" alone.  Other favorites are \\"Secret Life\\", \\"Youth\\" and \\"Chips On My Shoulder\\".  I can't rave enough about this album.  I think I'm going to have to put it on right now!

B00177E1Z0|5.0|Forget about whether you like the movie or not, this collection of songs is truly great!  You get excellent non-album tracks from both Cheap Trick and Loverboy, AND you get Berlin's, Miami Sound Machine's, Teena Marie's and Marietta's best songs ever. Not to mention great songs from unknown Larry Greene and maestro Harold Faltemeyer.  The two Kenny Loggins songs are actually my least favorite on here.  If you like a mix of 80's rock and pop, you will NOT be disappointed with this soundtrack.

Keep writing Mitch!
B002ZG99CM|5.0|I loved the original as a teen, and bought this one because of the cast - not my interest to see it remade.  Many re-makes don't live up to expectations, but this one did.      If you liked the first one, or even if you've never heard of the original, this will be an enjoyable and intense movie.    Great stuff.
B004AKCMD4|5.0|What's not to love about animated movies, generally they provide the very best pictures one can achieve on a blu-ray player and a 1080p tv. I have seen previews for the Legends of the Guardians and was enticed to buy the movie. Now that most Blu-ray movies are now also coming with a digital copy and DVD they are a bargain compared to DVD or Blu-ray only purchase prices of the past. Without giving out anything from the movie itself, I would say that I am disappoint someone important had to \\"die\\" in the movie without being flipped back to the \\"good\\" side however I suppose there always has to be drama. Worth a view and definitely stunning graphics!
B003XKPPOU|5.0|Toy Story 3 is as good as advertised.  You already know the characters from TS1 and TS2, and the 3rd episode is every bit as good.    Despite the liberal undertones (which many conservative viewers have overreacted to), the special feature Night & Day is AMAZING.  It's almost worth buying the disk just for that short.    You should buy this disc.  You'll love it, and so will your kids.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|When a whole bunch of older great actors come together whats not to like? Some people weren't happy with the movie but I felt it was a great change from the normal shoot um up movie styles lately.

B002N5N4M6|5.0|If you are reading this review, I advise you to buy these DVDs, even if I bet that you already know The Big Bang Theory, and in that case, I do not need to sell you the third season! But if I had something to tell you, it would be about how funny, how amazingly funny that story is, and as you may think, this is my favourite TV show, and that plays right into my wheelhouse, for I know a lot of Series, and no one worth this one, no one really. So I hope you'll enjoy it, even if I know you will!

B0038M2AZA|5.0|Temple Grandin is a true story of a woman who despite her autism became a scientist and a preeminent authority on the humane treatment of livestock (currently, over half of the slaughter houses in the United States are designed by her). The movie shows a few snapshots of her childhood but the primary focus is on her struggle with the disorder during the intervening years between high school and college.<br /><br />I had, prior to watching this movie, read one of Grandin's books ([[ASIN:1932565728 The Way I See It: A Personal Look at Autism and Asperger's]]), which proved to be a very helpful prelude to the movie. Her experiences with the disorder as discussed in the book, such as her hyper sensitivity to loud noises and textures, and her pattern of thinking (visual thinking, or \\"thinking in pictures\\") are all palpably conveyed in the movie.<br /><br />Claire Danes' performance is phenomenal, as Temple Grandin herself attests at the film's premiere, \\"Claire Danes became me -- I mean it was just unreal -- she became me in the 60's and 70's.\\" Having spent considerable time with someone who is autistic and being well-acquainted with the disorder myself, I too am in awe of her performance. (Credit is owed in part to the movement and speech coaches who helped Danes play the part so convincingly).<br /><br />The movie is deeply moving, inspiring, and a real tribute to the fighting spirit of those who suffer from a disability. It definitely made me teary-eyed more than a couple of times through the movie. *Highly* recommended!
B004LOUD80|4.0|The Last House on the Left Blu-ray Review     Distributor: MGM (US)    So much has previously been said about this film that it is almost as hard to write something original as it is to sit through the movie without feeling a sense of real dread and loathing.  That being said, there is much to like in the film itself. The story holds up pretty well and if you have ever wondered what it would actually be like to be either a killer or a victim thrown into a sudden struggle for life, then this film shows a realistic approach like no other before it. Forget all the routine slashers that would soon follow, The Last House on the Left dares to show its audience the true horror and danger of the human psychology and how far some are prepared to go to satisfy their fantasies.    The film was shot documentary style using 16mm cameras which adds to the realism, however it is not a title which will benefit from the kind of intensive restoration used for Blu-ray releases. The 1.85:1 1080p transfer is grainy, scratched, dirty and contains a small amount of print damage throughout the film, however none of this should be seen as a negative as far as this title is concerned. Ultimately the film looks exactly as it should and with far enhanced colour detail, this is easily the best it has ever looked on home video. Anyone expecting to see a brand new pristine transfer is clearly thinking of the wrong film here.    Audio is basic but adequate. Dialogue is clear and free from distortion but again don't go expecting to be making much use of your home cinema audio equipment. Like the transfer, the audio does what is required to match the film within.    Extras are surprisingly good on this release. It would have been easy for MGM to just release this as a bare bones disc, however there are 3 documentaries on the making of the film, 2 audio commentaries, (one with the films director and the other with the principal cast who sound like they have just walked off the set of the movie itself) and also some out-takes and explicit footage involving even more nastiness which was cut from the film prior to release. With a trailer and a  featurette on the films score rounding off the extras, we really have been spoiled for choice here.    For the horror collector or fans of the film, this release is an easy purchase. Being fully uncut and the best looking and sounding release so far and complete with a wide variety of extra features, the fact that the disc is not region locked also makes it a nice import for people outside of the US. MGM have however released this as one of their Best Buy exclusives, so you may need to dig around a little to find yourself a copy unless you have a US shipping address.    All things considered this is not really film which can be enjoyed, more likely appreciated for what it is. As far as horror movies go, this one is more a study in extreme terror and watching the film for the first time in many years, I had forgotten just how nasty this one can get. The film is from an era where fear and tension were more important than special effects and cartoon villains and to newer horror fans who grew up on one regular slasher after another, the film may seem dated or even a little slow, but for those who like their horror to almost place you at the scene of the crime, there is much to disgust and truly horrify in this film.     Like it or loath it The Last House on the Left is a horror classic which actually deserves its place in history as well as a worthy place in any respected horror fans collection.

The dual-tab system is definately the best I've seen for temporary screens, and the little applicator for smoothing out bubbles really helped and worked well.<br /><br />The only slight criticism is that the screen looks a litte (just a little) fuzzy, which I don't remember seeing on the screen I recieved with the phone. But it is not very noticable during normal use.<br /><br />Very happy, I have added this to my list of items to keep reordering from Amazon.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|Just to put this out there, this is one of my favorite books of all times. It's not happy, it's not romantic, but it was deeply engrossing. I re-read it the minute I finished it. Excellent. Just excellent.
B000089770|5.0|You gotta have this video! I already got it since its release in VHS and I had to get it in DVD; I found it at an awesome price in this site and the quality is great.
0385341679|5.0|I had a lot of ideas on how the end plot might resolve itself, but nothing I could imagine was nearly as good as what Ms. Moning actually wrote. I could not be more satisfied with this ending.
B000I0RNVG|5.0|A genuine gem of the Italian films; this movie will take you back to your childhood even if you are not from that place, bringing you the melancholic taste of a transformed land and cherish memories.
0670022411|4.0|As I said in my review title, I enjoyed this book, but I couldn't help thinking throughout that it was Harry Potter meets Twilight meets the DaVinci Code, so it didn't strike me as terribly original. There are witches living unrecognized amongst humans, just like in Harry Potter, along with an enchanted home that produces objects and rooms as needed ala Hogwarts castle. There are vampires, also living unrecognized, and a witch-vampire love story very reminiscent of Twilight with all its hot-body/cold-body, controlled desire/bloodlust themes (although this is among adults, not teenagers.) Then there is a Knights of the Templar type of secret society, with lots of hidden symbology, history, and cutting edge science ala DaVinci Code/The Lost Symbol (the author is a historian, so this part is very well-done.)<br /><br />So, if you enjoyed one or more of those books, you will probably like this one, but don't read it for a totally new take on magic, vampirehood or symbology/secret societies. It is well-written and really grabbed me in the beginning, and the end - it lagged a bit in the middle for me, when it was focused on developing the witch-vampire love story. And I did not know going in that it was planned to be a multi-book series, so was disappointed as I realized getting close to the end that everything wasn't going to be resolved by the time I finished. Personally, I like to know that going into a book! But I will certainly read the follow-up(s.) A fun and well-done diversion.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I love every single episode of this series and I'm getting my full collection using this site while paying almost half the original price; so far the two first seasons released. If you enjoy Malcom in the middle, well, this has nothing to do with that but I found out that Bryan Cranston is a wonderful actor that can transform himself from a very weird parent to a very tough criminal without loosing a bit of his talent as a comedian.
B000FC2PKG|4.0|This book was entertaining, if not the best I've read.  But for the price, well worth downloading!  It held my interest and was easy reading.  Perhaps not the best of her books, but definitely not the worst. If you like mystery/thriller books, this one fits the bill.  And with a little surprise at the end.  I recommend it!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|The very first season of a \\"very bad season,\\" but I'm not talking about \\"bad\\" in the negative sense of the word but with the adolescent meaning of something that is awesome and unique. If you watched already the first episodes, keep watching, and you must have it in your movies collection.
B001AQR3IU|5.0|I love this movie!  Bluray is the way to go.  Although I already owned this on dvd, the blu-ray is much more spectacular!  Totally recommended, a must!  The ultimate Fantasy movie, you won't regret it =).
B00005ATQD|1.0|I bought this movie as soon as it released on DVD. I was excited to watch it. I enjoyed other works directed by Kubrick like Spartacus, Paths of Glory, and Dr. Strangelove. I actually used Dr. Strangelove in a Cold War class I taught. I've also enjoyed other movies by Cruise and Kidman. I was excited. I heard reviews that raved about this being his \\"masterpiece\\". I could not have been more disappointed.<br /><br />This movie is horrible. I tried hard to enjoy it. I watched it several times all the way through just to see if I was missing anything. I wasn't. It's just not a very good movie. The plot is nearly indecipherable. It's slow and laborious to the point of boredom. It was hard to remain awake long enough to try to follow the plot...whatever it was. The acting is horrid by Cruise and Kidman. Most of what they do makes no sense and doesn't fit into any sort of coherent plot. I found the writing was juvenile and, once again, boring. The film is also too dark...and I don't mean the tone. I mean the lighting. The sex scenes weren't even tittilating. It's all quite strange without even a point that I could fathom. It's an awful film.<br /><br />I rate this as my least favorite movie of all time. I realize some people think it's just wonderful or a masterpiece. It won a lot of awards. That's fine. My opinion differs. I think it's horrendous. I'm sure there's a deep meaning to this movie that just went over my head. Maybe if it wasn't such a bad movie, I would have understood it. I understand all the \\"dream-vs-reality\\" stuff. I find it tedious. I just expect more from a Kubrick film. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone for any reason. I've seen no redeeming qualities. Stanley Kubrick somehow managed to make a naked Nicole Kidman boring.<br /><br />I guess that was an accomplishment.
0385341679|5.0|This book is going to rock your socks if you've been following the Fae Fever series. Also the condition of the book was like brand new and came in a timely matter. Thanks!!!!
B004MMEIK0|4.0|Roman Draganesti, an ex-monk, 500 year old vampire is a scientist. He has invented synthetic blood and his fusion cuisine has marketed such delights as chocolood, a mixure of chocolate and blood. Testing VANNA (Vampire Artificial Nutritional Needs Appliance), he breaks a fang. So,off he goes to find a dentist to re-implant his tooth.<br />Shanna Whelan is a dentist, but, after witnessing the brutal death of a friend, she is a) pursued by the russian mafia and b) afraid of blood.<br />Vampire and dentist meet. She needs protection, he needs her. Their worlds are far apart, can they make it work ? Can a vampire be more than a monster ? Will God forgiveness extend to doomed souls ?<br /><br />I enjoyed this book and all the ways the vampires deal with modern day life. Shanna's reactions to Roman were sweet and funny. It was sexy without being overboard, by which I mean that there is a story line and that the sex is pretty normal and does not take over the plot.<br /><br />My only negative comment is that I also got annoyed with the many - God's blood-. I understand type-casting your character's way of talking but please, too much is too much.<br /><br />I will definitively look for other books written by this author.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|I heard and read all the hype about this movie and honestly didn't care that much about seeing it.  After I watched it, however, I was glad that I did.  It was really good.  I rented it before buying it on Amazon.  This is a nice two disc set, with nice packaging and cool special features.  Just buy it.
B004DMIIOG|5.0|How this stuff doesn't get nominated for an Oscar for best animated movie of the year is beyond me.  It may not be the one voted best, but it deserves a spot in the nominees at least.
B003INBNXO|5.0|FIRST: DUBBED - SUCKS. I really hate serious movies like this that are dubbed. You loose so much when the native language is dubbed over with voice actors no matter how well they perform. A great example, besides this movie, is the really awesome [[ASIN:B00198X0UY Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [Blu-ray]]]. I watched the subtitled version and I was riveted to the screen. Epic story and so gripping I was completely blown away. Then, I wanted to share that amazement with my brother, who is not much of a reader, and he had a hard time keeping up with the subtitles so we switched over to dubbed. God awful. I was so disappointed.    Anyway, there is at least one single star review because of the dubbing so I am happy to give this 5 stars and let the other reviewer warn those concerned about why a great movie like this would get one star.    Not all historical movies are made as well as this one. The fighting is first class and the acting is, I think, superb if you can forgive the dubbing. I do wonder if that is really what Master Ip was really like, not because Donnie Yen played him badly but because his mannerisms were unusual compared to every other character in the film(s).    There are a lot of funny scenes in the movie. Considering part of the subject matter, the occupation of China by Japan, I found that to be a wonderful strength for the story. Japan was a cruel master of all occupied territories and this movie did a pretty good job of portraying that too. If anything, it was mild in that respect. They were merciless masters that starved their subjects to feed their war machine and their own people.    Although not a non-stop action movie, the story is well told, interesting and will keep your attention if you aren't an adrenalin junkie. Even more so since it is a peek into the life of the man that trained the legend Bruce Lee.    Highly recommended.
B002T9H2LA|1.0|Two and one half hours of viewing felt more like two and one half days. Get to the point already.<br /><br />One bright spot was the performance turned in by Waltz.
B000YMJA7I|3.0|It's the more popular songs, but \\"true\\" fans are left wondering where are the more \\"raw\\" songs that defined their talents and created their image as one of the best HardRock bands of all time.    They should have come out with an album titled \\"Side B\\" or \\"The Otherside of GnR\\" and inlcuded awesome songs like Don't Damn Me, Back Off Bitch, One in a Million, Estranged, Rocket Queen, etc.    Also, when I buy an \\"EXPLICIT\\" album, I expect to hear the artist's lyrics come through as it was meant to be, in all its glory, with all the emotions and meaning behind it.  Editing out a controversial word in the 3rd verse of \\"Aint It Fun\\" is a joke.  That alone makes this album worth passing on and just going straight to the real thing.      GNR FOREVER!
030726999X|5.0|This was a fitting book to be the ending of this quite stupendous trilogy about a brilliant, tattooed girl who takes on the world.  Lisbeth and her friend Blomkvist are working feverishly to clear Lisbeth's name and to bring down a top-secret agency buried right in the middle of the Swedish security police.  To try to attempt to paraphrase this book or, for that matter, the entire three books in this series is nigh impossible.  These books are complex and detailed, yet they all move at a break-neck pace in spite of that detail.  We are indeed lucky that Mr. Larsson handed in all three manuscripts at once or we would be deprived of this very memorable reading experience.  These books are totally absorbing and by far the best set of thrillers we've seen for a long while.  I recommend them highly, but read them all and read them in order.  You won't be sorry.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|The music and performances make you think you're front row,center!  It's  moving, uplifting and a must have for any music, musicals lover!  You won't be  disappointed...get it now!
B002ZG99TA|4.0|This movie is fun, and showcases the talents of a stable of very well cast actors. I missed the movie in the theater and wasn't sure what to expect. The only problem I had with this movie was that it is practically impossible for a train to run away they way they showed it in the movie. Airbrakes work the opposite way you expect. When an engineer pumps air into the brake line, it RELEASES the brakes on the train. If the hoses were disconnected between the cars, as depicted in the movie, the air would bleed out of the brake lines APPLYING the brakes. The only way for a train to run away the way they showed it in the movie was if all the air hoses were connected, the brake lines charged with air to release the brakes, and then some nobnoggin would have to go back and close the angle cocks on the brake lines on both cars where the hoses were supposedly disconnected, and then and only then, unfasten the brake hoses. Which they didn't show happening. And, even with the brake hoses all connected, without a air pump constantly keeping the air lines charged, the air in the brake line would slowly leak out, eventually applying the brakes.    Conversely, when either of the locomotives caught up to the train, they wouldn't have had to couple onto the runaway to stop it, all they would have had to do was to get close enough for somebody to reach across and lean down and open the angle cock on the air line of the first car. Dangerous but not as risky as trying to couple onto the cars. Once the angle cock was open, the air would bleed out of the brake lines, automatically applying the brakes.    The movie claims to be based on real events, and if this is true, either they didn't show the brakes being \\"properly\\" misused in the film, or it was based on a story from the steam train days back before they had perfecting the Westinghouse air brake.    I would have given this movie five stars but there was just too much stuff you had to ignore to make it believeable.
0670022411|4.0|I found A Discovery of Witches to be a rather interesting read as a supernatural fan.  The old basics of witches and vampires are included, melding well in a modern setting.  My only personal complaint is the science sometimes used in the story.  Several times what was being discussed went over my head, and as a reader it is hard to keep up in a story if you can't understand what's being discussed.<br /><br />That being said, I enjoyed the story very much, and look foreward to the next one when it comes around.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Agreed!  Nor will I buy the \\"enhanced\\" version of the original Star Wars trilogy.  Release the ORIGINAL theatrical version of those three movies on Blu-Ray, and I'll pre-order the moment I know they're available. Thanks to everyone for letting me know these are the \\"enhanced\\" versions as they are unacceptable.
B004MMEIK0|3.0|First my expectations based solely on the title were that it would be about a woman who sets out to find her Dark Prince Charming. \\"How to\\" has nothing to do with this book, though no one really expects it to be a self help book, it would have been funny if that had been the guide of aforementioned vamp gold digger, in fact the title brings to mind the Young Adult book \\"Jessica's Guide to Dating on the Dark Side\\" by Beth Fantasky. What the title does do is tell you three things 1) vampire man, likely mortal woman 2) that vampire is a millionaire and most likely important in his world and 3) romance. That's a lot of information for a title, huh?    Now, the book itself was amusing, entertaining and easy to read. It's great for a great rainy day read. Nothing in here was particularly new or innovative--he can read minds, but not hers, like I haven't heard that one before--but it's still good. And who knows, maybe those others were copying Sparks?    I think the real thing that kept me from giving it 4 stars (not five, it wasn't stellar) was that I looked in the \\"also by\\" section and I saw that Sparks also wrote a book called \\"The Vampire and the Virgin\\". Given this title, I know believe it was meant to be humorous but I remember seeing that book in Barnes and Noble one day and it just made a bad first impression, just bringing to mind all that is wrong and cringey about the romance section. Well, that and it was fairly predictable/formulaic.     Bottom line: If you can get it for free jump on it. If you're in desperate need of a light read, buy it. If you want to be blown away, look elsewhere.
1595141979|5.0|Wow!  I just finished reading Shadow Kiss, and I can't believe how good it was. When this book begins, the novices are being assigned Moroi royalty to guard for their field experience.  Rose cannot believe it when she isn't assigned to guard Lissa, but ----- instead! (I can't reveal that to you; you'll have to read to find out.)  Meanwhile, Lissa seems unaware of the extent that her magic is affecting Rose. Not only is Rose experiencing irrational anger, but she even starts seeing ghosts. The only good thing in Rose's life at this point is Dimitri, and things are going very well for the two of them.  Until the school is attacked by a large group of Strigoi, that is.  Now, it's up to the guardians and a few select novices to defend Vampire Academy.  In this game of life and death, Rose's loyalties have more consequences than she'd ever imagined.    This book was a page-turner.  There is so much going on in every chapter that you'll never want to put it down.  I love the character development in this book as well.  Rose continues to become more and more likable.  She's behaving more like a grown-up, and that's what makes this series appeal to older teens and adults alike.  There's a wide appeal to these books--romance, action, adventure, and the paranormal element.  This book was my favorite in the series so far.  I wouldn't advise reading it on its own.  It's absolutely necessary to read the first two in order to understand the choices Rose is facing and why she thinks as she does.  I'm anxiously awaiting the next installment!
B001UV4XUG|5.0|This is one of the sweeter, more intelligent romantic comedies I've seen.  It's well-written and well-acted, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character is incredibly sympathetic.  It took about two weeks from the ship date to reach me, which was longer than I expected, but I'm pretty sure the seller noted that it could take up to 20 days.  It arrived in good condition and in the original case, with a protective plastic cover on the top of the DVD.  I haven't tried to remove it because I don't want to mess around with trying to wash off sticky residue, but I did some research and found that it's possible to remove the cover and clean it up.

0385474547|5.0|I have started reading novels for 6months now and most of them are Europena based novels. I friend of mine advised that I read Things Falls Apart, which I knew my brother also read at school but could not find it at home. So I bought it and finished reading it in three days. Very interesting story and writer as well. Good bed time book to read.
0385342047|1.0|I knew what I was getting into when starting this book as I've read the entire series, but I just found this book to be pretty obnoxious.  1.  The interactions with Minnie were irritating.  The kid won't eat her carrots, Becky doesn't want the nannie to know so she stuffs them all in her mouth, for one.  2.  Kind of hard to feel for some one who has a wealthy husband but is plagued by the fact that she feels she can't spend any money when the world is in a recession and most people would love to have that kind of money.  To hear her whine about it nonstop is just aggravating.  3.  Luke and his mother got into a massive fight that Becky knows absolutely nothing about.  She's his wife.  She should know the details but she doesn't and it's just not supposed to be a big deal.      Basically the entire story is just going stale and things that might have been considered funny or cute when she was in her early 20's are no longer funny or cute now.
0670034711|5.0|I bought the book and unfortunately saw the movie before I finished the book, a friend advised not to watch the movie before completing the book. So much details are left out on the movie and the book is worht reading than watching the movie.
1439177783|5.0|I have a soft spot for memoirs, I admit and having always been torn with my own body image, I wasn't sure this memoir would be \\"healthy\\" (shall we say) for me to read it.<br /><br />I'm glad I did. Portia's brute honesty is powerful--shocking---courageous and refreshing.<br /><br />While she does ramble at times, I think that is her way--her voice. Often it was just as I was like \\"Alright Portia, lets get to the next point\\" that she'd say something so insightful, so spot-on and intuitive... that I was compelled to mass-email her pearls of wisdom to every woman I know.<br /><br />An absolute must-read for any woman who has dared to hate even a small part of herself.
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|I grabbed this book just before boarding the plane at LAX to Melbourne, Australia with my   Aussie husband. An avid reader, I had already read the book I planned to read on the trip during the layover and as I am a terrible sleeper when on a plane I was desperate to get another book to read for the loooong flight to the Land Down Under.  I made an excellent last second choice and laughed myself silly under the night light!  I have never had such an enjoyable trip over and looked at things in Oz in a new light.  Bill Bryson is a funny,knowledgeable, interesting, irreverent writer and I am glad I was fortunate enough to pick THIS BOOK in my haste!
B0045U9WPU|5.0|I won't bother with a concise summary of the book, as it's been done time and time before.<br /><br />But I will say that Delirium is a book that I'll keep in the back of my mind for a long time to come.  It's part The Giver, part The Host, and part (the movie) Equilibrium.  All rolled together.<br /><br />As a mid-20s female, I could still relate to everything going on in Lena's world, and would recommend this book to anyone who has read the Hunger Games trilogy or The Host and enjoyed the read.<br /><br />It's not a particularly difficult read, but it's not light and easy fluff like Twilight.<br /><br />All-in-all, highly recommended.
0439023513|4.0|Katniss has been rescued from the arena of the Hunger Games, and is now within the enclave of the infamous District 13, believed by the other districts to have been wiped out years ago by the Capitol. Gale is with her as they work with the rebels to take down the capitol, and hope to find a way to rescue Peeta, who was taken hostage after Katniss was rescued.    I liked Hunger Games, and I loved Catching Fire. I think that I enjoyed Mockingjay even more!    I never like to give away too much of a storyline, so I always feel compelled to keep my assessment brief.    There were some slow moments, but I liked the emotional degree in this book. I actually found myself tearing up quite a bit throughout this book as Katniss would touch on sensitive moments, and struggle to squash her emotions and gain control over herself. I fluctuated from wanting to wrap my wings around Katniss and protect her to cheering her on and telling her to go kick some butt!    I worried for Peeta and hoped they would successfully rescue him swiftly. I've always been Team Peeta! He's always been so compassionate, self-sacrificing and level-headed.    Prim is still a little duck, but growing up and becoming her own woman.    I loved Mockingjay, and I thought it a fine ending to a good YA series (my first YA series!). If you haven't finished up the series yet, but have been thinking about it, don't fear- it's worth the wait.
1416583432|5.0|This is wonderful, engaging book. If you love dogs and see them as a member of the family and not a merely a possession this is a good read. The author has a great sense of humor, a fantastic vocabulary, and a scientific background that makes her approach. I think, unique. Be willing to spend some time to relearn training concepts. This is less a \\"how to\\" book that a \\"why-it's-worth-it\\" book.
0061537934|5.0|Don't worry--it's not as lame as it sounds.    The premise of this compelling novel is based on a Mongolian legend that a dog with a highly-enough-evolved soul will reincarnate as a human being.    Our young protagonist is an up-and-coming race car driver coping with the exigencies of a young family, and--oh, yes--before both his wife and his young daughter he procured a lab-terrier mix.      Those of us who have ever had a relationship with a dog (yes, \\"relationship\\" is the correct word, here) will swear that s/he is wiser than all of us put together and can read what's in our collective psyches before any of us poor human relations can.  For those fortunates the book is written.      Even though there is a lot of race car jargon (Garth Stein, the author, used to race), the themes in the novel are universal enough that they should not discourage the layperson (Ever see \\"Brian's Song\\"?).  However, those who are familiar with racing will, I believe, will be in a better position to understand the connection between the techniques of racing and the mechanisms for coping with life's crises.    I, the reviewer, know diddly about racing, but have a son who does--and I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  Highly recommended, especially to dog lovers.
1433502437|5.0|Fabulous translation, with the most helpful study guides and descriptions to date. Easy to read, accurate and able to be studied in depth.  I think every accurate translation Bible should get 5 stars. Doesn't matter if it is your cup of tea, it's the Bible. You going to give the King James less than 5 stars; just because it is not modern day English. I'm not. I have 3 Comparative Bibles and 11 different translations. I have read the Bible cover to cover many times. This is my favorite at this time. I can study it in depth, I understand what it says (no not every word of course), it is written in American English and it accuratly follows the most accurate ancient texts. Enjoy and rate the Bible 5 stars for no other book holds God's plan for us and the Holy Spirit guide to how God wants us to live. Joyous.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|I purchased this knife on amazon after doing lots of research online which finally brought me to this one.  Awesome knife.  The blade if very sturdy.  The casing holds the knife very tightly and the blades receives sharpening very well and holds it edge.    I used it two weekends ago and actually was able to split the wood we had into kindling.   The only comment I would add is that it does not come with the island key which is needed if you want to tightened your blade to the handle.  I rigged up the island key on the casing which works great.  I would not hesitate getting a Ka-Bar blade again.
B0000DZ3EN|3.0|Amateur Hour.  This film pokes along with all the wonder of a statically animated Saturday morning cartoon - an educational cartoon - made by adults with no children who think that speaking in a condescending voice helps children trust them - while the air conditioning is broken - and you have to eat stale donuts and warm milk - while you keep smelling something sour.  There are good things here, but I feel like most of them are watered down versions of the wonderful books from whence they came.  Tick Tock, the Army of Oz, is a good character, nicely designed and executed, but they get so little out of him - he needs winding, yes, we got that, fun and funny once or twice, but that's really all he brings to the tale.  He needs winding.  Enchanted yet?  Jack the pumpkinhead contributes even less.  He has a pumpkin for a head and that's that.  Again, I have to say, adults without children or any sense of childlike wonder made this movie.  It's as if the presence of a pumpkinhead character is enough - you don't have to endow him with personality or anything.  The gump rounds out the cast.  He's a moosehead.  I hope that's all you need to know, cuz that's all there is to know.  A talking chicken outshines the whole rest of the cast, sets, and so-called special effects.  Okay, it was the 80s, computer graphics were years away, but this movie makes a stunning case for their invention.  I love me some Claymation, but not here, not this.  It looks like a cheap hack.  The green screen effects are embarrassing.  At some points you can see the green glow ON Dorothy - not just a bad matte.  It looks like something somebody did at a low budget TV station after hours, except I worked at a low budget TV station and it would be hard to do green screen this poorly.  And the poor little girl.  You can tell she was given minimal direction right before a take, with no attempt to get her to emote beyond \\"smile\\" or \\"you're sad\\" - half the time she looks as confused and bored and tired asthe included interview indicates she must have been.  It made me feel sorry for Jake Lloyd all over again.      And I know that the movie is truer to the books, darker in tone, etc.  No problem with that - knew that going in.  But what the heck is the deal with the ECT, or the threat thereof?  I can't think of anything darker that would still garner a PG rating.  I think they lost that plot thread, too, as they tie it back in at the end in the most tangential of ways.  Forced.  Hacky.  Lame.  Thankfully, the director never got a chance to make another film, or we might have seen Snow White in a Turkish prison or who knows what.  I'm sure 90% of the 1985 audience checked out emotionally at the point they put the electrodes on the little girl's head.  And they didn't even give her something to bite down on.  Her tongue!    They try to work Ozma into the story, and it's almost as if they forgot they had that loose end going and just bring her in at the end.  Even then, looking back on her part in the beginning of the story, it makes no sense.  Kinda like why the stern nurse is being carted away to prison in real life?  Because she stole all those heads in Oz?  She had a better fate in Oz, come to think of it.  I suppose we can just retrofit the 1939 WoOz and imagine that the Kansas Margaret Hamilton had a horrible disfiguring accident with scalding grease or something...tie up that loose end.    More than anything, for reasons unknown, this movie reminded me of \\"Alien From L.A.\\", another 80s mistake.  Perhaps it's the same tone - something in the water.  After all, the 80s really started to run out of steam in 1985.  After that, we were just waiting for Pearl Jam to be invented, living out our 80s lifestyles, trying to figure out how to use one-button mousen, looking forward to 50 more years of opposing Communists and so on.  This movie conveys that tired sensibility quite well.  So for that, I salute it.  And also cuz it might have helped inspire Nightmare Before Xmas.
B0036TGSIK|4.0|Emma Stone has a lot of great lines in this film, where she starts off accidentally lying to her best friend about losing her virginity.  Suddenly its all over the school and for some reason its big news and shes a big slut.  When did one girl losing her virginity become such big news?  Or make her such a massive slut?  Well, apparantly it does in this movie.  And it doesn't stop there.  She continues to add onto the rumors and her infamousness grows.  Its a hilarious movie and I don't want to give to much away, but it is one of those that you kind of forget after a few days, too.  Though you remember upon reviewing or talking about.  Definitly a teenage movie, but cute.  Recommended.
B004GHYCKW|5.0|We need more of these albums to show us history through song. Is this the way we want the world to be. You be the Judge. There are all sorts of medium now to assess art. Then you can decide whether which end of spectrum with everything in between you want to be.  Get it. Got it. Good.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|I might have passed this one by, except that it's produced by T-Bone Burnett. Here's another old druggie, been to hell and back (marrying Cher, if not being addicted to drugs and booze), scratching a living with guitarists impersonating his dead brother and abusive drunk partner.    Wrong. Allman is superb. Intelligent, soulful, he owns the music. And his voice is powerful, full of gritty soul, unrestrained, seamlessly melded with the genre and musicianship. T-Bone's spare production and arranging is also brilliant as usual.
B000ICM5IK|5.0|This is an awsome CD! I am a huge fan of these movies and the music. This CD compiles all the best songs from the movies. With some cool voice inserts before each song including Rocky,and Adrian. I am an avid weight lifter and this CD really can get the adrenaline going. I have no complants, and would recomend this to any Rocky fan.
B004LRZ2YC|5.0|This movie has good atmosphere, interesting characters, good dialog, good writing, and cool FX. What more could you ask for? The friendship that develops between the two main characters is an intriguing mix of creepy and touching. There are also a few surprises in the plot that made an old story feel new again. This movie is not shy about showing gore, but doesn't revel in it either, knowing exactly what to show and what to leave to the imagination.    -HS
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I first saw her perform on TV. She was poised and her performance was professional and outstanding. There were no gimmicks to her act - just the soulful voice. The very next day I went and bought the CD, and I was not disappointed.
0553062182|5.0|amazing book - really makes you think about things in a new light. this is for someone who is having a hard time being themselves and accepting the fact that they feel 'different' from everyone else around them. puts a new perspective on things. hope this author writes more books!
B000I2J6K0|5.0|If you miss being able to run or do sports or just overall being active like you were before you got pregnant, then this workout will definitely give you your fitness \\"fix\\" in a very safe way for you and your growing baby (throughout every trimester)!  I definitely wouldn't recommend this workout if you weren't very active before because it's moderately to very intense. If you're like me though and you were bummed when you found out you had many limitations for your prenatal workouts, then you'll be excited to know that this DVD will work for you and is completely safe (as long as you follow your doctor's guidelines for keeping within a healthy body temperature).  I never would've thought a prenatal workout could make my muscles sore!  This is great, and definitely an asset to my pregnancy.    (By the way, I started doing this DVD in the beginning of my second trimester and I'm still doing it in my third and I've had no difficulty or discomfort whatsoever besides the to-be-expected muscle work and soreness.)
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|On the surface this film comes across as a soft romantic comedy with a twist. It does well in that regard, but the main theme is considerably deeper and worth indulging in.    The plot revolves around a \\"jerk\\" who is forced to re-live the same day of his life over and over again. Accordingly, a multitude of excellent philosophical problems are referred to. For a start, I was reminded of Nietzsche's principle that you should live your life in such a way that you'd be happy for it to repeat in exactly the same way, over and over. Another idea referred to, even if implicitly, is the idea of limbo; being stuck in the same place as penance for your past sins. In this film, the main character tries a variety of methods to escape the repetitive fact that at 6am his life always reverts to 2nd February (Groundhog Day). There's also the idea of eternal life. The longing for immortality is probably universal, but this film dismisses it for the facade it really is very early on. There is also Sisyphus, who toiled interminably to roll a stone up a hill only to see it roll back down. That particular Greek tale about futility is reflected here in the protagonist's persistent failure to rise above his challenge (at least early on). Mixed in are commentaries about helping your fellow man/woman, and bettering yourself as a human being, including how much you can hope to atone for your past misdeeds, how quickly, and to what end!    What I'm trying to convey is that this is both an enjoyable film (though it might 'feel' slightly dated and wooden) but that the basic underpinnings of the plot are as good as they come, and that as such this film is not just suitable for mindless entertainment, but mindful entertainment too. It's a wonderful accomplishment that you can choose between the two.    Ordinarily, I'd comment on such things as the performance of the actors, cinematography and so on. But that is not the point here by such a stretch that I'll leave those well alone. Enjoy this film, not least because it's littered with some charming comedic moments as well, of the kind now largely abandoned by the Hollywood machine. It's not a flawless film, but close enough to merit five stars.
B0041KKYCY|2.0|I wasn't a fan of 1978's I Spit On Your Grave, but I also wasn't a fan of 1972's Last House On The Left. However, I gave the remake of LHOTL a chance, and I liked it. Sure, it had a disturbing rape scene (what rape scene isn't disturbing?), but the payoff was very entertaining. Seeing the rapists get killed in crazy ways by the rapee's parents was sweet indeed. I'm not going to be as kind to the I Spit On Your Grave remake though. It's vile and ugly, and it's not just the rape that is disturbing. Even the murders of the rapists is gross and hard to watch. I could have lived my whole life without seeing a man's severed penis stuffed into his mouth. But seeing that this film has a 6.4 on imdb.com, I guess I'm in the minority.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|although the movie of El Cid was a great story in film. the real story of Rodrigo de Bivar is very Different. I saw this movie when it first came out in 1961. I loved it. I kept asking myself why did they allow Heston to age but kept Sophia young. The real Cid did not die in Valencia as the Movie shows. he went on to live a great Life and died of natural causes in 1066. He had two great Swords that he named Tizada. & colada. His horse was Called Braca Which is Latin for Crazy. His Twin Girls were married off to different men of rich Blood. But the Cid was not happy with this and he let the King know it. It is said that when he went into Battle he would grit his Teeth in excitment. He was loved by his fellow countrymen and he was hailed a Hero of Spain. It pains me so to see that on some of his Statues in Spain they have written some very unkind words. I can only think that some people just have to make trouble where ever you go. But for me the movie of El Cid will remain one of my Favorites. remember movies are for Entertainment. the Director will change the story to show his view on a story and make it interesting.
B003Y2XI8W|4.0|This band is full of talent. They are proof that even in this age of digitized everything, there are still true musicians out there. These guys know how to write a pop song, and they can even perform their work themselves! I love love love this album. It's one of the best albums to sing to while in the shower, and don't try to tell me you don't sing in the shower.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Acclaimed filmmaker James Cameron once again made cinematic history with the breathtaking science fiction blockbuster Avatar. In the distant future, a handicapped ex-Marine named Jake Scully (Sam Worthington) accepts a job to aid a human colony in their mining venture in the jungle planet of Pandora where its inhabitants known as the Na'vi are strongly against the destruction to their home. Using an alien hybrid called an avatar, he makes contact with the Na'vi and becomes torn between following his orders and protecting the world he feels is his home. Avatar is an extraordinary and visually groundbreaking film spectacle that ranks as one of the most imaginative Sci-Fi movies in cinema history. Thought the story may be a somewhat clich&eacute;d with obvious stereotypes, the film is nevertheless entertaining and embracing. Cameron and his technical crew have spent many years developing the technology to create this Sci-Fi world and its inhabitants. Avatar represents an impressive leap in special effects and 3D technology. The cast also stars Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, Giovanni Ribisi and Sigourney Weaver.<br /><br />Avatar Extended Collection Edition is truly a must-have for Sci-Fi fans and home video enthusiasts. The award-winning blockbuster is presented in 1.78:1 widescreen format. The 3-disc Blu-ray includes the original theatrical version, the special edition re-release and the 3-hour extended cut. The picture quality is certainly reference quality with such eye-popping detail and vivid colors. The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio delivers a first rate home theater experience. The Extended Collection Edition also includes over 45 minutes of deleted scenes, the in-depth documentary Capturing Avatar, 17 behind-the scenes featurettes that further explores the film's production, screen testes, high definition picture galleries and theatrical trailers. Overall, Avatar Extended Collection Edition scores an \\"A\\".
0061537969|3.0|If you like sappy chick books (not chick lit, just a book I could never recommend to my guy friends), then this is the book to read. Grasping on the popular dog memoir/written from a dog perspective, this book was a disappointment for me.     It is a very easy read but I didn't think it was a page turner. The summary of the book follows Enzo the dog as he is apparently a Buddha and believes in the next life, and is not ready to depart as a dog until his life (IE: his owner's life) is complete. Even though the book addresses serious life events (his wife dying, him being torn away from his daughter, rape charges), the whole book feels really fake.
0756405890|5.0|I'm not going to detail the plot, as there are plenty of reviews and summaries that do that. This is a strongly charter driven novel set in a fully-realized fantasy world that includes a believable, self-consistent  system of  magic. Patrick Rothffuss does an exceptional job of crafting memorable characters that the reader can relate to. This is one of those rare books that is worth reading twice. On the first read, you can enjoy the slow reveal as puzzle pieces fall into place. On the second read, you will see the subtle hints and details in light of things to come and enjoy the book all the more.
B0042RUMEQ|5.0|This is a great debut album for Nicki. The songs have great beats. She is a great rapper. Really awesome cd. Glad that it is explicit. Great job! 5/5!
B003VPWXRO|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. I couldn't put it down. I won't summarize it because enough people have already. But all I know is that I will be very conscious of the messages I send to my daughter about weight, appearance and self acceptance. It has also inspired me to find the things in life that make me truly happy.
B002UHSDUK|5.0|I downloaded this after not being able to listen to a foo fighters song on You Tube without annoying commercials invading my peaceful existence, and the last straw was when I finally accepted that itunes would likely never lower the $1.29 price tag for the good tracks. You have won, foo fighters. I have paid for an album, and I don't have to deal with a bunch of crappy songs. It's a good deal.
B000KIRT6A|3.0|I got this in the mail today and plugged it into my pedal board just prior to the amp. Like the other reviewers on here, I'm sad to report that it's quite 'hissy'. I had hoped that it would not be a hissing type of pedal but it is. I'm using a Line 6 Uber Metal, Boss Metal Zone, Ibanez LA Metal & Boss Compressor/Sustainer with my SKB pedal board. The board itself is not noisy at all with any of the other pedal cranked up BUT when I put the EQ700 in with the others, there's a noticeable hiss though not so much at low volume but when you crank the amp (I'm using a Peavey Special 212 Transtube combo) above 4, you can definitely hear the hiss. Not sure if a noise gate pedal would reduce this but I'm going to give the Danaelectro Fish & Chips (as recommended by another reviewer) a try.<br /><br />I'm waiting on the Behringer Orchestra Chorus pedal to arrive and HOPING it isn't hissy like the EQ700 is.<br /><br />I will say though I do like the tone influence this pedal has. It does a nice job of altering the tone & gives my rig a greater flexibility for sounds.<br /><br />Overall I give this pedal a 3 out of 5 stars.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have never gotten a Jillian Michaels dvd workout before.  She really knows how to kick your butt.  The workout's systematic get harder as the DVD progresses.  Level 1 when I first started this was a challenge.  Level 2 was even harder.  Level 3 was the best grueling and hardest of all the workouts.  When she says 20 minute workout with no rest, she is not lying.  After all the workout I'm exhausted and sweating up a storm.  She really knows how to work you out.  And you change up the workout so you won't get bored.  I highly recommend this product for a beginning rookie or a veteran work out guru.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I LOVE this workout video!!  I bought it thinking yea right, how hard can a 20 min workout video be?  Well I'm in pretty good shape but hadn't been faithfully working out in the last few months and she totally kicked my butt!!  I look forward to it everyday now.  I just preordered the new Ripped in 30 and the 6 week 6 pack videos.  I can't wait to get them.  I don't really have time for an hour workout and this really combines all you need into a shorter time.  I'm on Day 5 of Level 3 right now and it is definitely hard, a lot of the work is done in plank position but really works your whole body!  I would highly recommend adding this one to your workout collection!
B002R0F3Q2|4.0|This is a good cd. The lyrics, and harmony and everything. She has great vocal talent and just great sounding songs. This cd is the element on awesome. Great job!<br /><br />My favorite song is :Unthinkable (I'm Ready)
B003X73QA8|4.0|This album's critical success is due to it's playability, the instrumental talents of the band, and most likely the bittersweet nostalgia expressed by the songwriters.<br /><br />I have enjoyed getting to know these tunes, but after a week or so, I'm already bored. You can only write so many songs about one topic. Apparently, somebody misses his childhood days growing up in a suburb. I don't know. I just wanted something that would keep me going on the treadmill, and I've found that a few tracks are good for that. When I realized that the lyrics contained a resounding theme of hopelessness due to the quality of municipal building codes, I realized I must be getting old. I'm past worrying about all that crap and I've learned that humans are just foul. We can't be stopped in our constant befouling of our whole existence. It's nice that these young people are getting the drift, but this perseverating is enough to make me wonder what will happen to their emotional states when they, in turn, have a house full of kids? Will they consider their own impact on urban sprawl?<br /><br />Time will tell.
B000O77SRC|4.0|Die Hard with Bruce Willis as John McClain is the nearly perfect action movie.  Lots of stunts, an interesting storyline and subdued special effects make it fun and exciting.  The characters in the story are not that well-developed except for Hans, the mastermind played by Alan Rickman.<br /><br />I won't get into plot summary as that is better done elsewhere.  Just my impressions of the film and the themes presented.<br /><br />It's great how the mastermind is smarter than everyone else and is less than happy with the guns that he has hired out.  They're a gang of thieves pretending to me terrorists.<br /><br />We also meet the limousine driver, a young black man who has no clue that while he is drinking it up and chatting with his girls on the phone, a kidnapping and murder is happening upstairs.<br /><br />We're not really sure about John or his relation with is wife other than they are somehow separated.  Their children are not really touched on much, and most of the cardboard characters in the Christmas party we don't really have much sympathy for.  Even the loudmouth cocaine-snorting employee who tries to negotiate and gets himself a bullet in the brain is not that well loved!  Kinda glad he got snuffed!<br /><br />The most compelling parts of the film deal with the themes of one man against a well-manned army led by a mastermind thief.  Secondly, the arrogance displayed not only by our cocaine friend, but also the incompetent deputy chief of the LA police and the two snarky FBI guys who think they know it all but in fact know nothing and are easily led astray by Hans, as the FBI \\"plays it by the book.\\"<br /><br />There are graphic scenes of killings, blood spray and bullets flying that may be hard to take for some viewers.  The 1980s were a great time for action films and Die Hard was one of the more popular and most copied.<br /><br />The Die Hard series released a whole slew of sequels.  There's even a new one coming up in another year or so called Die Hard: 24/7.  But nothing beats the original!<br /><br />Cast<br />* Bruce Willis as Detective John McClane<br />* Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber<br />* Alexander Godunov as Karl Vreski<br />* Bonnie Bedelia as Holly Gennero McClane<br />* Reginald VelJohnson as Sgt.

1416583432|5.0|fascinating book to read for anyone who has a dog or is getting a dog.  interesting insights into how we interact with our dogs.
030745455X|5.0|This is the second book in a series of 3.  The setting is Sweden, which, at first, gave me some trouble as I had no point of reference.  Once I got past the fact that I did not know areas referenced in the book, I was able to REALLY get into it.  The author was able to create characters that I felt I really knew and totally cared about.  I hated when this book ended and look forward to the next book.
B000SINT52|5.0|While I may live in the USA part of the time, (spending retirement dollars) I am glad to say that I am not an American.  I view the average American a very \\"mute\\" person offering only passive resistance to what it's Government scares them into believing are the facts.   The Country's present economic condition is caused solely by a Government that is out for bettering it's upper members, not the betterment of the people who they \\"supposedly\\" serve.   No Bank Regulation / No Brokerage Regulation / No Financial Regulation. Why? Regulation would not line their pockets as quickly and deeply.  Iraq and it's neighbors !!  Excuse me? Why does the average American just sit back and watch it's sons and daughters be sent into death situations when they know that their \\"leaders\\" falsified information on weapons of mass destruction to start a war that will not be won or lost, has nothing to do with who had what weapons, and as this film points out so boldly, made (and continues to make) many of these leaders RICH beyond comprehension. That's something to be proud of indeed.   HOPEFULLY, there will come a day that \\"Mr. Ms, MRS. average\\" will stand up and say \\"NO MORE\\".  The outside world more and more is considering the USA as not the place to dream of.   Michael Moore is a stand alone. When will the American people take heed and show the rest of the world that their ideals are not the \\"ideals\\" of it's Government?  Poverty / Health Care / Education are but 3 of the more important factors to be dealt with Immigration is NOT killing the people. Why spend time on it when POVERTY, lack of HEALTH CARE, and a severe lack of EDUCATION of the young is.   Watch Egypt. Watch it's neighbors. Does the American have to stand up as we see there? Probably. But will they. Probably NOT!    Well done Michael Moore. Another eye opener.       PS: I once met a political leader from another country that said this, and I quote: \\"Government should never be heard from until the people it serves requirestheir aid.\\" Further he said: \\"Government should fear the people, the people should not fear the government.\\"     AMERICANS.....wise up!
B0040BF4L0|5.0|Lark Rise to Candleford is a must buy for people who are drawn to the past.  The characters are strong and the acting impecable.  Unfortunately the time to watch it was not long enough as I went on a Lark Rise Marathon!!!!    Can't wait for Series 4 to come out.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|We all know what to expect when we watch a film on the food supply: stomach churning, grainy film of horrendous slaughter house carnage that keeps you awake nights. I couldn't let the family see that, so I watched alone, and was pleasantly surprised. Most of the usual blood and guts (not a euphemism) had been edited out, and there are only a few unpleasant segments that are a minute or so long, and are well telegraphed so that you can avert your eyes. It is a shame that the producers could not have taken a leaf from the Pollan documentary [[ASIN:B0012680D0 King Corn (Green Packaging)]]\\"King Corn\\"  which is entertaining, has a whimsical story, and informs as well, all without the blood, etc.<br /><br />I watched this for the information, and it was stunning, as well as informative. Well presented, and not overly frightening. Nice extras as well...give it a try!
6304712499|4.0|Most people see it as a cheasy 90's movie that had bad acting, but I thought the movie was great for what it was. It is actually based off of a comic series of the same name. I thought the movie was great because we see so many stereotypical super hero movies, and spawn was the opposite. His character is alot darker than most(he's a ressurected human from hell)and he actually start off doing work for Satin. Honestly this movie was just ahead of its time, which is why it suffered. Before we had Spiderman,Xmen,Jonah Hex,Captain America, and now even Thor is coming out, there was Spawn which came out in a time where special effects were nothing compared to what they are today. If you can get past the cheasyness, and the rough acting then Its a good buy in my opinion.
B004G600A4|5.0|I have to agree with numerous other reviewers: I generally like seeing animated films, but I had no interest in seeing this one when it was first advertised.  Disney spun it as an MTV version of Rapunzel, and it came off cheesey and gimicky.  Over time I kept seeing more and more great reviews and film teasers that actually looked quite gorgeous and well-done.  Finally, my 4 year old asked to see it and we took a chance and brought our whole family (My husband reluctantly agreed, and my 2.5 year old we weren't sure would sit still through it).  My girls, my husband and I sat mesmerized from the first scene to the closing credits.  Only at the very end, when Mother Gothel gets what's coming to her, did my 2.5 year old utter a sound.  As we walked out, my husband, who its fair to say is NOT a Disney fan, and I looked at each other and simultaneously said \\"That was AWESOME.\\"  It really is the best animated movie I have seen in a long time, if not ever.  You feel emmersed in a heightened sense of reality.  The scenes are so saturated and stunning; the rendering of the textures (Rapunzels hair alone is entrancing), facial expressions, the backdrop details... everything is so beautiful that you can't look away.  But on top of the magnificent artwork, there is a wonderfully touching, suspensful, exciting and funny story.  All of the characters are likeable and engaging without being the least bit sappy or helpless and my daughters fell completely in love not just with the strong but conflicted title character, but with Flynn and Maximus as well.  The songs and lighting effects are very reminiscent of a broadway stage production and really add to the suspense/drama/tenderness of the scenes.    I could go on but I think you get the picture.  Someone said the Academy overlooked this for Best Animated feature in 2010... I don't know how that's possible.  To me it is on an entirely other plane from any other animated film out last year.  I highly recommend it.
B004NS710C|5.0|Having been a railfan for most of my life, I was intrigued when I saw the previews of this movie back in the fall.  Having seen it on the big screen I was simply amazed at the thrill-ride I was on for 1 hr and 38 min.  I know this movie is based on real-life events, though they were overexemplified in the movie simply because, well it was made to make money for the motion picture industry.  You have 2 morons at the beginning of the movie who look like they belong anywhere but working in a rail yard, especially Ethan Suplee who hops out of the cab of a high-power locomotive attached to a consist of 39 cars while it is in motion, even though his co-worker warns him the air hoses are not attached, rendering the air brakes useless to stop the train!!  Then you flash to a rookie conductor (Chris Pine) and a veteran engineer (Denzel Washington) whom are out on a routine day of hauling cargo.  From there on out it is non-stop action.  I have to admit that some of the scenes were rather ridiculous, if not entertaining and hold-your-breath types, such as the one where the lashup (2 locomotives connected together to haul heavier consists) driven by another veteran engineer (David Warshofsky) derails and explodes after 777 bumps it as it goes into the siding and also where the (what were they thinking?) young Afghanistan veteran is lowered from the helicopter onto the fast moving locomotive and gets knocked off when 777 hits the lashup hard.  After that it is nuts with the drama and suspense as Pine and Washington try to speed up and couple their lone locomotive to a 41-unit train with 2 much more powerful locomotives in full throttle, how did they ever think they were going to be able to stop a 70-plus mph train with one older, well-used locomotive?  Rosario Dawson did lend a very good performance in her role as yardmaster and communicating and connecting with Pine and Washington during their daring chase.     I will admit I was on the edge of my seat in the theater when thiswas released in November and eagerly awaited the DVD release, though I have to admit it isn't quite as riveting on a TV screen as it is in a theater.  The ending was a bit of a letdown as it just simply ended and with no air brakes I don't see how Chris Pine could have braked that 75-mph train in a very short distance.  The one nice plus is he reunited with his estranged wife and child.  Guess it takes a near death tragedy to bring a couple back together...    All in all, a great movie worth watching for a thrill ride.  Think I saw it 4 times in the theater.

0670022411|1.0|The women (and one man) who were put to death as witches at Salem in 1692 were the innocent victims of mass hysteria.   They suffered real torment and were killed in horrible ways. That this book blithely casts them as \\"real\\" witches, and even has the ghost of at least one of them  hanging around today as a sort of benevolent audience, is almost unbearably offensive.      That alone makes this book almost complete trash.  Not to mention the dull characters, ridiculous prose, and tired plot elements (vampires! secret societies! vast wealth! violence!) that the reader must wade through.    I tossed it aside after about 150 pages--with no regrets at all.

B000059ZT4|5.0|I don't know what grabs you most about CATCH A FIRE, the first studio album that Bob Marley and The Wailers made for Chris Blackwell's Island Records in 1973.<br /><br />Was it the stripped-down, simple chords that ran through the album? Was it the choir-like harmonies and barely noticeable synthesizers that adorned this low key collection that makes it a painless, listening pleasure?<br /><br />The original album was entitled, The Wailers: Catch A Fire and the graphics department decided to have some fun and create an album cover from the old, gun-metal cigarette lighters that was popular in the 50's & 60's. They were able to meet the initial printing of 20,000 copies before they discovered that it was not logistically possible to do so both financially and productively. But an even bigger problem was just beyond the horizon when Chris Blackwell decided that he need to have a name and face attached to the group. It was a music-industry practice that proved to be a bane and a boom if the group became a success. It was something no one was ever able to convince Peter Tosh of.<br /><br />The original album is collection of 8 songs that cover the broad gambit of reggae themes such as protest songs, love songs and the celebratory pan-African themes. But, like every Bob Marley album and especially what makes Bob Marley's albums different from every other reggae album is that his songs go beyond--way beyond--the simple obligatory homage to reggae loyalist. His songs strike to the heart of what's universal. That's why when we hear a Bob Marley song or we sing a Marley song or ever see a picture of him, the themes that he so eloquently chanted comes rushing back to our present consciousness.<br /><br />His brilliance was that he could use simple metaphors and sing them in such a soft almost passive way but we understood the anger, the frustration, the delusion, the euphoria of being a human being. In these songs, we clearly see the complexities of our lives and our relationships.<br /><br />Since this deluxe edition has two versions of Catch A Fire, it should be mentioned that when The Wailers and subsequently, Bob Marley & The Wailers produced their albums they made two version of each album. There was an international version and there was a \\"Jamaican\\" version. If you've ever traveled down to Jamaica and listened closely to a Wailers song, you'll think it was some kind of remix, but it is the standard version that the Jamaica people know and would think that the cd versions we have outside is the \\"strange\\" version.<br /><br />In addition to the more well-known songs that have been covered umpteen times by as many artists over the years like \\"Concrete Jungle,\\" \\"Slave Driver,\\" \\"Stir It Up,\\" and \\"No More Trouble,\\" you also have two songs where Peter Tosh sings lead and it is a refreshing break to hear him man such songs as \\"400 Years,\\" and \\"Stop That Train.\\"<br /><br />But in addition to Tosh's songs, you have two catchy ballads \\"Kinky Reggae\\" and \\"Baby, Baby We've Got A Date.\\"<br /><br />In 1996, Mobile Fidelity, the premier audiophile remastering company, produced the second of only two (2) Bob Marley albums for their catalog. Mobile Fidelity (or \\"MoFi\\" or \\"MFSL\\") presses select albums from the master copies and places the `cleaned up\\" sound on 24-karat gold discs. The sound reproduction is unparalleled. If you're able to get a hold of the MoFi edition of [[ASIN:B000000IUO Catch a Fire]] and [[ASIN:B000000ITY Exodus]], it is well worth the investment, especially if you have high end stereo equipment.<br /><br />CATCH A FIRE: The 5th Greatest Reggae Album of All Time.ion has two versions of Catch A Fire, it should be mentioned that when The Wailers and subsequently, Bob Marley & The Wailers produced their albums they made two version of each album.

0321701763|3.0|Since Amazon does not check the validity of their sellers I never received the book. After quite a bit of email and phone-calling they are set to refund my money, though it hasn't happened yet. Do not buy this book from a Amazon seller unless you check whether the seller is a reall book vendor. Apparently Amazon does not care to undertake this little detail leaving us customers at risk. I suspect this book is a good product but I have yet to see it thanks to Amazon.
B0034G4OUO|4.0|This film is actually a Spaghetti Western, only they use cars for horses. It could be called Driver, Cop and Killer. The title Faster is sheer obfuscation.<br /><br />A man, played by Johnson, gets released from jail and goes on a revenge rampage. He has no name, just `Driver'. We sympathize with him while he kills some and lets some others live.<br />`Cop' is Billy Bob Thornton at his most impressive, and least likable, a junky with a dirty past and a doubtful present.<br />Then there is `Killer', a male model type, an English hitman living in an advertising dreamworld with a pretty blonde female model type and speaking impeccable English while discussing his trade. Killer gets hired to eliminate Driver, guess by whom.<br /><br />It may surprise you that more people survive this than one would expect.<br />The funniest scene in this solid piece of earnest parody is when the killer has married and his new wife becomes tearful over her husband's chosen calling.<br />If you take this for suspense, you may be disappointed. There is not all that much. If you enjoy it for its lovely clich&eacute;s and its camera work, and the sound of the engines, there is some pleasure to be had.<br />If you are tired of 'action' films, this one might offer the right level of repose, provided you approach it in the right spirit.
0307474712|4.0|This book kept poppin up everywhere I went. When I saw it on the best list for 2010, I finally bought it and LOVED IT! I ready fairly quickly cause I really enjoyed the relationship between these two people. It was romantic, fun wit, and I just couldnt put it down to find out what happens next over the course of their friendship that spans a couple of decades. I think this is the next Harry Met Sally movie sor sure!

B001N1DPDE|5.0|I do a lot of work in the woods on our wooded property and have broken two fixed blade knives in the past 2 years - and yes, I was using them in ways they shouldn't have been used.  I was also getting tired of stainless blades which, to me, are difficult to sharpen. I decided to get a tough, good quality carbon knife that would take the punishment.  I ordered the Becker BK2 by Ka-Bar and I got ONE INDESTRUCTABLE knife!  This thing is massive and appears to be a ¼ inch thick pry bar that someone has sharpened one side!  I've batoned through firewood, chopped through [small] limbs, cut feather sticks, and pried bark off a dead tree stump and I don't believe it has a scratch yet on the blade.   If you're looking for something with which to do heavy work, I can recommend the Becker BK2 for a belt knife with some backbone.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|I loved this book!  I loved the new take on vampires, witches and daemons.  I loved the way the story is built slowly.  I love the characters and the fact that you get to know them really well.  But I hated the ending.  All I can say is, there better be a sequel in the works or i'm going to want my money back!
B000PMLFRA|1.0|George, these movies are nearly a decade older than I am--and yet I loved the original versions so much I had star wars pajamas and all the toys I could convince my parents to buy.  Now, instead of bringing back that awesomeness we get to see a wierd CGI alien lady sing and dance awkwardly in Jabba the Hut's palace.  Because that's what I want to spend $50 dollars on.  Wait. No I don't.  I read a review once that I'm starting to believe more and more these days.  It said that Star Wars was great in spite of Lucas, not because of him.  The reason the movies don't get better as your go IV, V, VI, I, II, III instead they get worse, is because after the initial sucess of the first movie or two, the studios have gave George so much 'artistic license' that he was free to make crappier and wierder movies every time.  Hence the ewoks, probably least favorite thing out of the original three.  Hence that blabber thing in Episode I.  Anyway, not going to be buying this one.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I bought this cable so I could keep using my PlusDeck, I still have cassettes to digitize. The installation went perfectly; I ran the install program, then plugged in the cable to the computer, and then the PlusDeck, it worked perfectly from then on. I gather there are other cables out there which are more of a pain to use, I'm glad I got this one since it was so easy to install and use. I recommend this cable for anyone who needs to use RS232 but their computer doesn't have a COM port for it.
B002ZG98C8|4.0|The mother of all macho-action-grunt-splosion movies, and if you were expecting something different, I don't know what trailers you were watching. Easily the most morbidly hilarious film I've ever seen, I was cracking up at over-the-top triple decapitations within the first minute and shocked at the kind of material that was eliciting so many belly laughs. It's paper-thin by design, proudly heavy handed and clearly something everybody had the time of their lives filming, but the entertainment value does start to wane by the end of the second act. May have been more fulfilling as a joke trailer, though I'm sure I'll watch it again when I'm in the mood to shut off my brain.
0977326403|5.0|It's the mission ...the mission ...the mission.<br /><br />What distinguishes a good company from a great company?  If you're in the private sector, chances are that your answer is profit, return-on-investment (ROI).  In 1972, $10,000 invested in Southwest Airlines would be worth $10 million thirty years later; if you invested in Pan Am....  In the social sector, what makes an organization great is its performance relative to its mission.<br /><br />\\"Good to Great and the Social Sectors\\" builds on Jim Collins' earlier work and is a standalone monograph for those whose business it is to serve.  No doubt, some principles of management transcend sector but some do not.  How do you harness the power of individual volunteers to achieve greatness when no one even has to show up?  How do you motivate (and retain) a staff that is not working solely for the money?  How do you create and maintain an organizational culture that stubbornly, resolutely, persists in the face of uncertainty, when you and the individuals you serve are not valued as much as when times were good?<br /><br />In today's world, budgets for government agencies and funding streams for voluntary providers are in doubt.  At the most prosperous moment in human history, we are experiencing class warfare like never before.  The American taxpayer is \\"mad as Hell and not gonna take it anymore\\" ...as if \\"it\\" was cruel exploitation taken while the taxpayer was distracted --presumably watching an episode of The Simpsons.  Sadly, many politicians are reacting in kind.  For a social sector organization to navigate in hostile waters, it had better be thinking about its mission.<br /><br />\\"Good to Great and the Social Sectors\\" is a guide for leaders of organizations that care about people, but it is also realistic about what it takes to become GREAT.  After all, that's the point.  It will help you focus, organize, and value those in your organization who have a desire to give meaning to one's life.  It will help you assess the turf and build your brand; \\"anyone seeking to cut funding must contend with the brand\\".<br /><br />Jim Collins says, \\"If we only have great companies, we will merely have a prosperous society, not a great one.  Economic growth and power are the means, not the definition, of a great nation.\\"  Bravo!r brand; \\"anyone seeking to cut funding must contend with the brand\\".

B001BMKOZW|4.0|This is Daron and company doing their thing. After the SOAD hiatus (which they are coming back and doing live show's in Europe in the summer of 2011, as for a new album...they said that they are not even sure when they are going to put out new material because they want to test the water with new shows and see what people think, so we have to wait and see....) it was announced by Daron that he would create a new band called Scars on Broadway with John from SOAD.     As for the album itself, it is pretty much a LOVE or HATE kind of deal, there is no black or white areas with this album...You either LOVE it or you HATE it. For me, I love it, but it is VERY DIFFERENT from any SOAD album. For the people that are expecting a System Of A Down album, you are going to be very disappointed. If you go into this album with an open mind and remind yourself that this is a Scars On Broadway and not System, than you MAY like it.     Lyrics:    Two words and two words can only explain the lyrics: VERY STRANGE. There are some songs where he talks about Charles Manson (3005, Insane, Stoner Hate), and some stuff he actually talks about his childhood (Babylon). Most of the other songs REALLY drift off into left field (Cute Machines, Live Forever/Kill Each Other, Funny, Serious) but the others are pretty catchy (World Long Gone, Enemy, W*****g Street, They Say). One of the songs (They Say) pretty much talk about the Bush Jr. As for the rest of them...they lyrics are very strange but most of the lyrics are very catchy.     Sound:     Daron hasn't done anything like this; it is a mixture of electronic, dance, rock, and just about everything under the sun. It is a very experimental album, and in most ways it is pretty well executed, but sometimes it kind of makes you think \\"What was Daron smoking when he made this album?\\" Still, it is pretty well executed well, but it definitely makes you wonder what goes through his head.     Presentation:    Daron is known for his CRAZY antics on and offthe stage; if you can find it, there is a 2005 interview with System Of A Down that is floating on the Internet, and the stuff that comes out of Daron's mouth makes you just wonder if this is him in real life or is he putting on a show. When Daron is by himself doing an interview, he acts normal, but if he is with ANY of the SOAD members, I guess he decides that he has to be crazy.     The presentation of this album feels like Daron and company were trying to make something different, and for me I enjoyed the album all the way through once I bought it when it first came out and it has been on my iPhone ever since.     Conclusion:    Though this album is DIFFERENT, sometimes it can be a good thing or a bad thing...for most people that are System Of A Down fans (including myself), if you haven't bought this album yet, it is worth checking out, but do remember...if you are expecting another SOAD album, than you will be VERY DISAPPOINTED...But if you go with an open mind, than you MAY like this album...If you are unsure, listen to it before you buy.     Happy Shopping!
B0000797IO|5.0|It seems like Jennifer Aniston has a new movie out  5 times a year.Everyone seems like the next one but with a different male lead.\\"The Good Girl\\" is so different from all the others.Its a funny,sad,excitting film.So far \\"The Good Girl\\" is the only film that shows her great acting talents.
B0034BW9CO|5.0|This is a great, accessible album. Period. I'm fairly new to a lot of latin music (bachata, salsa, merengue, etc.) and I only speak a little Spanish. Still, I found this to be a great album. It may sound silly to some, but I'm being honest. Though I still have a lot to learn as far as the language goes, the music itself, the melodies, rhythms and singing are all awesome. It's a bachata album, of course, but it mixes things up enough to stay interesting and entertaining. Some artists get boring to me because it basically sounds like the same song over and over again. Not Prince Royce. All the songs are great... well, I feel the Stand By Me dance remix is kind of unnecessary, but thats it. This is one of my favorite bachata albums so far, behind Aventura's The Last. If you're new to bachata, definitely pick this up. If not, well, take it where it's coming from, but I love this album. NEW YORK'S HOLDING IT DOWN!!
B000005RSE|3.0|Hmm, SINGLE-BILINGUAL (as a stand-alone track) isn't the most scintillating that the Pet Shop Boys have done. \\"Discoteca\\" is more interesting, putting the Spanish-lite vocals and Spanish-tinged rhythms to better use. Still, the track doesn't quite come all together. \\"The Calm Before the Storm\\" is more typical and put-together: gentle vocals, pretty arrangements. Interestingly, the Trouser Enthusiasts' take on \\"Discoteca\\" actually puts the disco back into the track, improving it. The Pet Shop Boys' own extension of \\"Discoteca\\" actually makes better sense than the shortened version, adding a nice string intro and giving a real disco feel to those drums and the (almost random) Spanish chanting. \\"Confidential\\" sounds like a throwback to their showtune days -- in other words, it's classic Pet Shop Boys. I only wonder how it would sound with Tuna Turner. Baby Doc's mixes of \\"Single-Bilingual\\" and \\"Discoteca\\" go for a harder, more progressive dancefloor sound. Nice.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Yep, just adding a voice to all the others crying out for the unaltered versions.<br />Oh, and I bet the extra's won't be able to match some of the documentaries some fanboys placed on YouTube.

I couldn't have hated this book more. I was so mad at the author for the ending, after cursing and crying, I threw the book in the trash so that no other working Mom would be fooled into reading a book. And now they are making it into a book? Let's hope they change the ending.
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins    You lose, you die!    *****     When I looked at the \\"Hunger Games\\" book, I thought it would be about who could go the longest without eating any food. The book was a story of intense survival.  It was full of excitement, blood, and a path to survival. The book was nothing compared to what I thought it would be.  It was much better! The book had many dramatic turns, including a great one right after the actual games started.    This is a book of fiction written by Suzanne Collins.  It is set in the future in a nation called Panem.   Panem has a place called the Capitol where all the people who live there are rich and it has 12 districts where peasants and other poor people live. The Capitol has an annual event known as the Hunger Games.       Every year, each of the 12 districts must send one girl and one boy between the ages of 12 and 18 to the Hunger Games.  They are sent into an arena, where they fight to the death.  It is watched on live television. The winner becomes famous, and if you lose, you die. This isn't just people fighting one-on-one.  The contestants, they are called tributes, are put in large arenas intended to look like places in nature. The tributes have to fight each other, the weather conditions, and different things set up by the people in charge of the games.   The goal is to stay alive. The children from the district are fighting to death for the enjoyment of the rich people who like violence.       The main character was Katniss, a girl who volunteered to go to the games so her younger sister would not have to go.  Peeta is the boy from the same district as Katniss.  They work together, but in the end there can only be one winner.       I liked the book because it had a lot of violence in it during the competitions.  I also liked the book because it was scary, and I always wondered what was going to happen next, like when the fire balls were about to kill Katniss.   In closing I had a lot of fun readingthe book. It will have you wanting to read the sequel, so I recommend that you read this book if you ever get the chance. I feel that this book is good for people in the age group of twelve to forty years old.
1558908846|2.0|After seeing this movie, all I can say is.....WOW!!  I mean, I knew that Sly Stallone made some bad movies in his time, but this one just might take the cake.  I mean, this film makes [[ASIN:B0045HCJG2 Cobra]] look like it was written by Shakespeare.  It took me 20+ years to get around to seeing this film, and I must say ~ I didn't miss much!<br /><br />In this DREDDful flick, Sly is a futuristic cop who is arresting office, judge, jury & (sometimes) executioner all-in-one.  This simplifies the judicial process, but of course expediency comes at a price.  Is there a place for due process in the far-off future?  Hmmmmmm.....<br /><br />Rob Schneider is supposed to be the comic relief of the film.  Problem is, I found him to be SO annoying that I was rooting for the bad guys to whack him all the way through the storyline.  Alas, it didn't happen.  What a shame.<br /><br />So what, you ask, could possibly raise this movie up to a 2 star billing?  The answer can be told in two words:  Diane Lane.  She is SO gorgeous AND(!) she's a talented actress.  Her lifting this movie up to 2 stars is akin to Atlas holding the world on his shoulders.  I mean, Diane Lane in a movie like this is like a sparkling brand-new Lamborghini in a used car lot full of clunkers.  She can't help but stick out!<br /><br />I will give credit where credit is due:  Sly has made some good movies in his time;  [[ASIN:B0006GAO5Y Rocky]], [[ASIN:B00004STDN Cliffhanger (Collector's Edition)]], [[ASIN:B002ZG999U The Expendables]] and [[ASIN:B000MEYKEG Lock Up]] to name a few.  This one doesn't even come close to that top echelon of Sly films.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|I absolutely love this movie!  I got this movie only a few days after I purchased it.  Great service and great movie!

B0000027RL|5.0|Do I dare say it? Zeppelin had IV, Floyd had Dark Side Of The Moon, The Who had Who's Next, Guns N Roses had Appetite For Destruction... But Pearl Jam has Ten. This very well could be the greatest Rock ablum ever recorded. Call it what you will, Grunge, Hard Rock, Classic Rock, it doesn't matter. This album opened the door to a musical era that provided more power, enthusiasm, and passion than any in recent history. And it didn't end there. Once the Grunge and Seattle scene started to fade, a new crop of bands started to emerge that would take just as much musically from Pearl Jam as the acts before them.<br />Along with the major hit singles Alive, Even Flow, and Jeremy, there are the monster Rock standout tracks Once, Why Go, Porch, and the haunting Deep. But this album isn't just full throttle Hard Rock, no, it also has an emotive side. Not like any of Lead Singer Eddie Vedder's vocals aren't full of emotion anyway, but the songs Black, Oceans, Garden, and Release are bleeding from every pore with raw feeling, and a power that stands as a firm foundation for the songs to sit on.<br />Throughout the album, Guitarists Mike McCready and Stone Gossard work their fretboards to death with presicion and volume. Bassist Jeff Ament and Drummer Dave Krusen lay down a solid rhythm throughout the album that goes from Rock to Funk effortlessly and rigth back again.<br />All in all, a great starting place for Pearl Jam, Rock Music, Grunge, Musical perfection, or many other things. Also, a place for other bands to take lessons on what makes an album that will stand the test of time, just as Pearl Jam did from Zeppelin, Floyd, The Who, and others.<br />Perfect Album!
0061733199|3.0|The introduction mentions that life has changed greatly since the publication of the original edition of this book some twelve years ago and so it was revised.     That's all. There's nothing mentioned as to what was updated or revised that tells what makes this worth buying, and my somewhat cursory examination shows very few changes. The author needs to learn how to tell potential buyers what he changed so as to give them an idea of whether or not they want to re-spend money to buy something they already have.***     IMHO, if you have the original edition, you don't need buy this one.    However, should this is your initial purchase of it, then this is not a bad book to begin learning about basic survival.    ************************************************************  ***There should be laws that require this ...... <g>

B000002KNI|2.0|I liked this recording so much I decided to purchase the CD, to replace the album and to accent the DVD that I have.  I was shocked to discover that all the chatter between songs was eliminated. This should have been noted on the CD description.    Sure the songs are great, but some of the whole sense of their being \\"in concert\\", i.e., all the asides and such, are missing.  I give it two stars only because I wish that producers of CDs and DVDS would be more forthcoming about what they cut from a title of the same name.
B00008GKEG|5.0|I'm 63 and knew where I was when i first heard the Beatles one of the groups that has provided the soundtrack for my life and brought the country out of it's depression after JFK was assasinated. I actually owned the Anthology on VHS so I was just updating it on DVD. Loved, loved, loved it! It's also an historical document as seen through the Beatles development and music. There will never, ever be a group or songwriting team like them and their music crosses all generations. Glad I was able to find it on Amazon.

193413712X|1.0|Don't buy this book unless you like experimental fiction.  Even then--even then!--there's a good chance it will drive you nuts by page 50.  I made it all the way through, somehow, and I don't like experimental fiction.  Looking back on the experience, I honestly don't know how I finish it.  I found the writing nauseatingly precious, buring whatever philosophical import under paragraph after paragraph of...I can't even remember what.  Words.
B004G6009U|5.0|I took my 7 year old daughter to see this movie at the theatre in 3D.  My first 3D since the 50's or 60's.  They sure have come a long way with that.  When we got there I figured the place would be at the most half filled since we saw it on the 4th day of release.  Boy was I WRONG!!!  I actually think we got the last 2 seats.  Anyway back to the movie itself.  My daughter bugged me to go so I went thinking I could get in a quick 90 minute nap.  NOPE!!!  That movie had me from the start and I just loved it.  My daughter has done nothing but asked me about getting the DVD and when the heck is it coming out so she can buy it (ya know dad is paying)and watch it over and over again.  This was a very good movie and I highly recommend it for all age groups.
0385341679|5.0|This book was excellent! I blew through the series in a little over a week. This book is very hard to put down after you start reading it, it begins where the last book ended leaving Mac in an impossible situation. It ties up so many loose ends, and reveals some secrets about some of the characters that you would never have guessed. Mac becomes stronger, and learns to accept who she is and makes an incredibly hard decision regarding the prophecy. Read it, you won't regret it!
0061537969|5.0|Very simply if you are a dog lover - - and a people person this book is a must.  It is well written, thought provoking, inspiring and wrenching all at once.  With the used pricing structure there is no reason NOT to read it.
0060936223|4.0|Loved...    The descriptions of New York.  The occasional name-dropping.  The haunting ending and her recounting of Mapplethorpe's last days.    Not so much...    The fact that most of the book only covers RM's very very early period.  While his beginnings, their beginnings, are fascinating, the most interesting period of Mapplethorpe's life is probably (i say probably because i don't know for sure) his years in the spotlight, mid eighties.  We don't get that.  Most of the book is sixties, early seventies, well before his heyday.    Her writing is a little ridiculous, a little too poetic.
B0038BBA4I|4.0|This is a great album, but only if you're into new things or the old, organic folky music.Think of this band as Flogging Molly marrying Simon and Garfunkel and having a child and calling him Mumford. I give it four stars.
1579128149|5.0|Theo Gray's book takes the publication of images to a completely new level.  The elements come alive in a way that it orders of magnitude better than anything you could find in regular chemistry textbooks.  It also places the periodic table at the center of the action, as the overall organizing principle, another aspect that is to some extent neglected in current chemical education.  For example, attempts to ex[plain the form of the periodic partly led physicists to the discovery of four quantum numbers to describe electrons in any atom.  Go and get Gray's book and use it to teach better and learn better.<br /><br />Eric Scerri, author of The Periodic Table, Its Story and Its Significance, Oxford University Press, 2007.<br />[...]
B003L20IHE|3.0|Not an Oscar Winner by any stretch of the imagination, but not unwatchable either. Critics panned this movie and especially Efron's performance. I didn't think either one was that bad. Maybe I am easy to please or just a sap, but I thought the movie was okay and did not regret watching or buying it.Not for everybody, but what movie is?!!
B0024FAR5W|5.0|Nothing to be disappointed about here. Seems like the Sopranos on motorcycles. Great acting, great plots, plenty of action. You never know what is coming next. I'm definately an addict and if you watch a few episodes I think you will be to. I hope this show never goes off the air.
0316069884|5.0|This is not a call for vegetarian lifestyle, but rather an attempt to open the eyes of the reader to the unhealthy practices and unethical treatments of animals in the meat industry.  Even omnivores such as myself can walk away from this with a better knowledge and understanding of how to make choices that are healthier for myself and my family in terms of food choices and cooking.  The biggest lesson here is to eat local, fresh, and organic whenever possible.

0739341340|4.0|I listened to this Audio CD on a beat up old boom box while recovering from Lasik Eye Surgery because the light from my iPod was too strong to attempt downloading anything at the time. The Narrators voice was deep and easy to focus on it almost drown out some of the pain I was feeling. Almost... I did just have a laser shot into my eyes. This great narration aided me in my ability to concentrate on the book and make me forget all about how itchy my eyes were while lying in my dark room with the blinds shut like a vampire.<br /><br />And that opening sequence I just wrote is sort of what you will learn from this book. How to tell stories that parachute right into a topic by giving concrete examples that people can remember. There is a lot of material to go around here and I have to admit I was in and out of sleep while I listened to the 7 CDs over 2 days of recovery. What I got out of it was to tell stories that relate back to people (because we are hard wired to care about people) and give concrete anchors (again CONCRETE) instead of just firing off stats, percentages, and more numbers that will blur in the minds of your audience.

B004I2K4E8|5.0|When I saw this play on Broadway in NYC several years ago, I was totally thrilled by the performance. Viewing the Blue Ray edition of the 25th Anniversary of this magnificent musical, not only refreshed my memory, but sent my senses away! I highly recommend it to all the Les Miz fans out there. The sound and HD video was just perfect. There is an extra surprise at the end that I will not detail here, but be prepared the be blown away!
0064407667|4.0|Imagine your house burning down, finding out about your own parents' death, and the fact that you have to stay with a terrible guardian who you never even met before - all in one day.  Now, does that sound like the perfect day to you?  Well, the now three orphans just found that out.     Violet, Sunny, and Klaus Baudelaire have not exactly been having the best day of their lives as they planned.  That day Mr. Poe (Arthur Poe) drove up to the kids as they were on their way to the beach, and he said that they must come quickly into the car.  He drove them back to what was left of the house.   Everything was everywhere!  It turns out that there was a fire that destroyed everything in sight.  No one knows how the fired started; they just assumed they left the stove or oven on.  Where or what were the three going to do?   To make it even worse, their parents did not survive.  The fire got to them before they got to the door.  No good news came from this story, not even the fact that when 14 year old Violet turns 18, she will inherit the huge fortune that once was her parents.     The parents said in their will that they wanted the children to stay with the nearest relative.  So they stayed with Count Olaf, their very distant cousin.  He attempts to marry violet in order to get the fortune.  So he's sneaky and makes the wedding into a play.  Yet the three know it's a trick.  Yet, the only thing is, his hook-handed friend is holding Sunny in a cage outside the window.     What will become of the poor orphans?  Will they be able to escape?  Or will they be stuck with Count Olaf forever?

B004JMZPJG|4.0|This camera bag fits a DSLR with medium zoom lens well and that was it. There is no place to add a flash or even another small lens. There are 2 pockets on both sides, but you can only keep some memory card or lens cloth. As mentioned, it is good for a day trip to take pictures.<br /><br />There is not a whole lot padding to protect the camera, so don't plan to drop it! Inside the bag, there is no form fitting attachment, so some camera might not stay in place. This is a no frill bag, works but by no mean a heavy duty camera bag.

0802798225|5.0|Have you ever read a romance novel? Usually characters are very alike in these types of books, well not this one. Perfect Chemistry is about two very different characters. In the book it describes how their relationship moves along. I really liked it though because it is not usual for someone to write a book about two people from different worlds. Simon Elkeles really writes the book in a way that hooks you into it from the very beginning.      The characters in the book are bad boy Alex Fuentes and popular rich Brittney Ellis. Alex participates in a Latino Blood gang and is the kind of guy with tattoos and guns. Brittney on the other hand, lives in a mansion and wears clothes that cost over $100. Both of them stand on completely different levels of the social ladder at Fairfield High. Of course, these two would never get along. Unfortunately later, they end up being lab partners in chemistry.       Since they are lab partners, they tell each other they should at least try to get along. How could they get their semester project get done if they didn't?  Throughout the book Brittney and Alex visit each other's houses, and meet each others friends and families. The plot of this book is based on their relationship and how it progresses over time.      I personally really liked this book because I thought it was very interesting. I never wanted to put the book down once I started! I loved the action and relationship between the characters. Even though it is a romance book, romance is not all that it describes. It also shows the difficult life and real problems of some teens. This drew me into the the book even more which made it even better. I can't wait to read more of his books!      I would recommend this book if you like action and romance. Now it is up to you to really find out the true ending. Will these two very different people get along and fall in love like any other book? Or will the only chemistry these two work on be their project...
0143035711|5.0|Love, love, loved this book. So well written, you feel like you are there. I never wanted to put this book down. As high a recommendation as I can give.
B001HZK8FY|5.0|I ordered this for myself but I can see this being a great gift. It is very true to the movie and is really cute.
0670022411|3.0|I'm a bit flummoxed by this book because, while it did entertain me for approximately 60% of the time (I'll explain in a bit), I am so perplexed by its conclusion that I am unable to offer any wholehearted endorsement for recommending it to other readers.      The author is obviously a talented writer, and infuses much scientific/historical descriptions in the context of the book.  The story flows (after a certain point) very enjoyably and the characters are interesting, well-developed and the dialogue (initially, at least) is intriguing.        The romance between the two main characters begins well enough, but quickly develops into an eyeroll-inducing mess. There really should have been more development to get from a slight tension between the two to the \\"I'd-give-my-life-for-you\\" stage. With nearly 600 pages available, you'd think there'd be a little area in there to do so (just sayin').  The overall story also develops so.very.slowly.  It took at least 70 pages to be drawn into the book (or the \\"I can't put it down\\" stage).  Before that, it was a struggle to continue reading and there were really moments where I was (gasp!) contemplating not finishing the book at all.  Also, the conclusion is just about THE MOST UNSATISFYING ending in the history of books (okay, that may be somewhat hyperbolic).  Thus, the \\"60% entertaining\\" statement.  This book is basically just a vehicle to sell the next few books in a series, which is insulting to those who purchased what they thought would be a typical book that has, you know, a beginning, a middle and an end (which, I guess, would just be boring and predictable, so why not throw in a surprise non-ending).      Additionally, let's go back to the overall storyline set up, which is that the main character, a witch, comes across a lost manuscript and a thrilling adventure begins.  Do you know what happens with that lost manuscript?  Well, reading the entire novel isn't going to tell you.  Yes, it's probably mentioned a few times throughout the novel, but the writer quickly loses interest in what initially has drawn the reader into the story...until the end, of course, because it appears the manuscript may play a part in the second novel...but don't set your hopes on a conclusion in that one, either.  Anyway, if you read the description of the book, you would rightly assume this manuscript plays a major part in the development of the book, and that just doesn't happen.     Overall, I can't say I didn't enjoy the book, because it was enthralling between pages 70-450 despite the sophomoric romance.  The writer introduced many intriguing ideas (a supernatural society, DNA components of these beings, potential offspring, what may happen with a potential public awareness of this society, an impending \\"civil\\" war between the supes, etc., but ultimately these intriguing ideas were just that, ideas, and as in the case of the \\"lost manuscript\\", were never fully developed to a satisfying conclusion.  It's amazing what a really bad ending will do to a book - I was sure that at page 350 I was going to be recommending this book to others and putting it on my \\"Do Not Sell\\" shelf, but sadly, I'm deciding now whether to just burn it.

I have no idea how there can be so many bad ass characters that are so different from each other, but Erikson and Esslemont have done it.  This is the only book series I'll admit to having felt like crying more than once while reading.  You get to know the characters as if they are real people, and when they die it hurts.

B000X1BPYQ|4.0|This is by far their bast work and not only. This album is one of the best black metal albums i have ever heard. i hate their previous work but this album makes the difference. Most of the tracks are amazing. My favorite is Nemecic. I am not a fanatic black metal fan -> i judge most of these albums very negative but here is one of my exceptions. There is passion here (this is not another depressive album). Its a masterpiece in the black metal scene. To tell you the truth is the best black metal album after Cruelty and the beast by Cradle of filth.A must for all black metal fans and for metal generally fans (its so good).

1595141715|4.0|I read this book for my book club and I read it one sitting!  I could not put it down, even if I tried.  The voice of the young girl just captured me too instantly and thoroughly to walk away from it.    The author, first timer Jay Asher has an amazing way of jumping between the two main voices, a teenage boy and a teenage girl.  I was struck how clearly he was in the mind of each when it was their turn to talk and how even as a teenage girl, he was able to convince me as a reader that I was in fact listening to a girl on the brink of suicide.  Even though there is quite a bit of sarcasm and even joking from Hannah, the girl the book is about, there is no question that this is very serious stuff.    Asher builds such tension throughout each revealing of the tape that it caused a physical reaction in my body.  I found myself tense and waiting as if on egg shells to see what happened to Hannah as each tape is played out.  The two voices were such that there is no doubt that heartbreak, disappointment, revealations, and confusion was running a muck in each character's psyche.  For a first time author, I have to commend Asher in his ability to capture the tumultuous time of teenagehood.    The book was devastating, and real, and truthful and needs to be read.  A very touch subject, full of \\"expert\\" opinions and ideas about what pushes people to suicide, but in the end, it's an examination of a soul who just couldn't take anymore disappointment and heart ache.     I loved this book.  Read it.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I'll preface this with 2 things:  1. I NEVER do reviews but this product is definitely something I wanted to put my 2 cents in on.  2. I mixed this workout video with my training schedule for a 10K (Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday runs--Sunday in increments of .5 miles starting from 3 miles, Tuesday runs were 3 miles and Thursday runs were 2 miles).  On Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday were cross training days--these are the days I did this workout video.  I also used the Firm Wave system with this workout and it does WONDERS.    I started this workout video the day I bought it (thanks Amazon for letting us live stream!).  In the course of one month, yes, one full month, of doing this workout video with my other workout routines, I have lost 10 inches on my waist and hips!  Two whole pants sizes!  And 10 pounds!  No joke folks, if you dedicate yourself to this, it WILL work.  I've only been managing level 1 and did a few times in level 2, but my runs have been increasing which makes me tired on my non-run days.    Pros:  -definitely a sweat  -no time to take breaks (and if you do Jillian remarks on them!)  -something quick to do when you don't want to go to the gym or be outside in the rain/snow/sleet/heat/freezing cold temperatures    Cons:  -no water breaks--make sure to keep a bottle handy, I did and took a second or two to down some water if I finished the reps quicker than the video  -some of the moves I still cannot do (I'm at 238 lbs right now), but instead I substitute in the Firm Wave routine so that I am at a continued workout pace      This is a great product for someone looking to burn a sweat and burn calories in the process.  I cannot tell you how worn out I felt the first day after the workout.  A burn like that lasts a number of days!  After doing it enough, I can see the toning in my body, but I don't feel nearly as worn out as that first workout.  It's an awesome feeling to know that you are working those muscles and are actually losing the weight/toningyour body.    You CAN DO IT!  And Jillian will help!  Once I get through all of the levels I'll be investing in more of her products.
0385341679|1.0|I am a big fan of Karen Moning. I read all the Highlander books and all the Fever books and loved most of them. When this series started, I was hesitant but even though I had to push myself through the first few chapters of book 1 I did get into it. The world of this series is dark and gritty, and mysterious. I love the descriptions because they make it all seem real, and I love that I only got Mac's point of view, because it made me feel like I was in her place, just as confused.    I think I got my hopes up too high during the 2 year wait for this last installment. The 4th book ended on such a cliffhanger and there were tons of theories floating around. I read Shadowfever and couldn't believe what just happened. THIS is what I'd been waiting for so long? The biggest plot points were breezed over so quickly I had to re-read sections to make sure I didn't miss it. Darroc? Really? Half a page? And Barrons' son even less than that. It was such a cheap shot. And then there were parts that got expanded to hell and back that were totally useless to the plot, just more \\"mystery\\" to fill the pages.     The worst part? This was supposed to be the last volume, the resolution to everything. It was a bunch of small \\"okay, so that's done\\" parts glued together with minimal plot. AND the cherry on top of the cake - there are supposed to be 3 MORE books!?! I've never been a fan of never-ending series and I aplauded KMM for leaving the Highlanders behind and taking a chance on something new. This, however, was a BIG disappointment and the more time that I have to dwell on it, the more I feel this way. KMM broke my heart with this one. That's the bottom line
B003UESJF6|5.0|After watching the trailer for Megamind, I was not excited to attend. However, after attending the movie, I had decided I needed to buy it right away. It is one of the best animated shows that has come out in the last while. I was laughing out loud in the theater (which I almost never do). Clean, funny humor around every corner.

B000002A3T|5.0|This is one of the most underrated Pink Floyd albums. It is a blend of absolute gems and the more you listen to it, the more you realise how amazing, and perhaps even ahead of time, Pink Floyd were. 5/5 for this album. For me, it is right up there with Dark Side of The Moon. Absolutely recommend it to anyone who is into Pink Floyd.
0670022411|4.0|In the magical world that Deborah Harkness creates there are witches, vampires and daemons that exist unbeknownst to us. When Diana Bishop was young she lost her parents and she turned her back on anything to do with magic. Now she's a scholar researching old manuscripts at Oxford's Bodleian Library.<br /><br />During one session she calls up a manuscript that has a strange power. She instantly knows that it's bewitched and somehow resists the pull of the magic within. After she returns the book she notices that over the next few days there is a sudden increase in the number of magical creatures in the library and the general area. This is a concern because whenever a large number of magical creatures gather the chances of humans noticing something strange increases.<br /><br />One of these magical creatures is Matthew Clairmont, a centuries old vampire. Matthew has a growing interest in Diana and takes it upon himself to protect her from the increasingly agitated creatures. It seems that the mysterious manuscript, Ashmole 742, has long been sought after by witches, vampires and daemons alike. The book holds secrets that can shift the power balance in our world.<br /><br />Now together Diana and Matthew have to figure out how to call up the book again while avoiding those who want Diana for the power she has over the book. But as they grow closer they are thumbing their noses at the Congregation, the nine members (3 of each species) that rule the magical world because of the rule that forbids creatures of different species from mating. Will the pair avoid trouble and find the answers they are looking for before war breaks out between those willing to defend them and those that support the Congregation?<br /><br />Phew, I think that is the longest synopsis I have ever written on my blog but this book is a whopping 579 pages and it's jammed packed with history and back story that was essential to a believable storyline.<br /><br />A Discovery of Witches had a bit of a slow start but once I got about a third of the way through the book the pace picked up and the storyline got a lot more interesting. I love the way Harkness created such an authentic world for her characters. I was a little disappointed by the romance between Diana and Matthew. I understand that to a vampire that was born in 537 time is measured differently but the lack of progress in the relationship was a bit of a downer for me.<br /><br />When I started A Discovery of Witches I had no idea that this was the beginning of a series. As I got down to the last few pages I started getting that feeling that there weren't enough pages left to get me to a satisfactory ending and sure enough there is a huge cliff hanger at the end but I was far from disappointed by the ending. I cannot wait for the next book and recommend this read for anyone who loves intrigue and  paranormal suspense.ird of the way through the book the pace picked up and the storyline got a lot more interesting.

B003VANOFY|5.0|It took me very long time reading reviews before I decided to get this baby. I was in between Razer Megalodon or Logitech G930. They both are very good surround sound emulation headphones. One thing that Megalodon really getting me like is the comfort over your head. I read that Megalodon is mastered comfortable on this. It's very important for gaming for a long period of time. But I ended up choosing G930. And I didn't regret for this.    Reasons I picked G930 over Megalodon are:    1st Wireless - I know someone don't really care about this, but wearing a wired headset does taken off some freedom of my head movement. And I love how it feel with wireless. I do concern a little bit of getting brain cancer thought. lol    2nd Sound Quality - 7.1 Surround Sound by Dolby. They got great reviews of this. I trust Dolby more than Razer's sound technology. I'll not compare a headphone to real 7.1 speakers set. But I have to say WOW. It blows me. It's amazing how headphone does emulate surround sound job so great. I assume surround sound emulation can be very good because both speakers are very closed to the ears. It really does the sound trick like it's surrounding. I play BC2, and now I can really tell which direction the enemies footstep, gun shot, vehicles are coming from exactly. Before I was using stereo headphone, I could only tell it's from left or right. But now i can tell it's from behind to front without problem. It helps out gaming a lot.    3rd Comfortable - It's actually pretty good. It has very big and soft ear cups to cover my whole ears. I don't feel any uncomfortable at all. May be Megalodon is still a better choice for comfort, but the G930 is not much behind it. and a Big Plus, the weight is actually 20% lighter than G35. It has battery inside and it's still lighter. Can you believe it???    4th The Price - $114.99 Amazon did me a big favor to list this price last week. I can't say No to this anymore. lol. Come on! It's a wireless 7.1 Headphone. This is way too cheap if compare to others. LOL!!!! Thank You Amazon!    Oh, and Razer Chimaera the new wireless headphone for PC/360 is coming soon this Feb, I still think G930 is a better choice for PC gamers. It's much cheaper, Chimaera is $200. G930 is 7.1 good for future HD sound while Chimaera is only 5.1. I know most games only support 5.1 now, but I'm sure we'll get 7.1 game sound soon. G930 can be used while charging, I don't think Chimera can be used while charging, it's kinda suck. I'm not saying Razer is bad. I love Razer, I use their Naga Epic mouse and Black Window keyboard. They are the best gaming mouse and keyboard that made in top note quality with no doubt. Ok this is all my opinions.     Enjoy!
B00275EHJG|5.0|The bittersweet transition from childhood to maturity is beautifully exposed in this third TOY STORY adventure.<br />All the favorite toys are back.  Tom Hanks and Tim Allen return with stellar support from all.  There's action, chases, peril, romance, humor..it's all there, exquisitely crafted.  But the most memorable scene is when Andy painfully donates all his toys to cute little Bonnie and relives his boyhood one last time before heading off to college.  Real lump-in-throat time.<br />There's not a bad thing to say..a real treasure.
B003UESJFG|1.0|I saw this movie at the theater. It's a great movie, I highly recommend it. It's at least a 4 star movie. A great animated film that is suitable for kids and enjoyable by people of all ages.    But what's this crap with just the 2D version? This isn't the only movie doing it either. If the studios want to sell me movies that came out in 3D, they can make a ******* 3D version. I bought the 3D movies I like in 3D. I didn't buy the ones not available in 3D. See how that works studios? You have to put out a product I want, or I won't buy it. I am so sick of all the double and triple dipping with the special additions and such as well.     I bought Despicable Me, because Universal had the good sense to give it a proper 3D release. So what's the deal Paramount? Where is my 3D version of this?    When I buy a TV, they don't tell me all they have is the basic model, and maybe if I'm lucky, they'll sell the deluxe version later. If I order a fillet, they don't tell me \\"Maybe another time, have this sirloin instead.\\" I would like this in the highest quality. If I didn't care about quality, I'd just download it off the piratebay.
0515127485|4.0|The joy of Robert Harris is always the details of the worlds he creates (or re-creates).  In Pompeii and Enigma, he brings the Roman Empire and wartime-Britain to vivid life for the readers, most of whom (even for the latter case!) would not have been alive to see it personally.  In Fatherland, he goes one step further and creates a Nazi Germany that won WWII, and speculates on how that society might look on the inside.  With Archangel, Harris finally moves into modern times, into post-Cold War Russia with all its uncertainties and strife.<br /><br />It would appear that Harris was intrigued by the idea that Stalin was more popular in Russia than any of its current leaders, despite the fact that he committed genocide, needlessly exposed his country to attack from the Nazis, and dealt brutally (through the NKVD) with any questioning of his ultimate authority.  Thus, in this story we follow the adventures of the historian with the unlikely name of Fluke Kelso.  He is an expert on Russian/Soviet history, fluent in Russian, a star who didn't shine quite as brightly as his grad-school promise indicated he would. He is invited to an academic conference in Russia where he meets a Russian who claims to know the whereabouts of Stalin's secret papers, which disappeared (if they ever existed at all!) the very night that Stalin died.<br /><br />What are in the papers?  Do they even exist?  Kelso first attempts to drink the answers out of the old Russian, and when he turns up dead tracks down his daughter. Along the way they pick up a reporter (a CNN or FoxNews style videojournalist) and together they make their way through the frightening world of hard-core communist hangers-on, around Moscow and eventually to Archangel, a run-down naval port on the Arctic Ocean.<br /><br />As you might expect from Harris, there is far less action than there is suspense, which makes the action all that more satisfying (and poignant) when it does occur.  Also to Harris's credit, the secret Stalin papers are not a mere McGuffin - we learn early on that they do exist, and we learn what they contain by about the 1/2-way point (I'll say no more, except that their contents trigger the trip out of Moscow to Archangel).  It is a clever, and even plausible setup, and I enjoyed the first 2/3 or so enormously.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the events that take place in Archangel don't quite live up to the hype for me.  I think the problem lies with the characters.  The action itself is somewhat far-fetched, but not impossible, and certainly should be an easy sell in a thriller like this.  Unfortunately, the characters are not likeable enough to give them the benefit of the doubt.  The historian is self-indulgent and self-loathing, and yet somehow conjures up the energy to latch onto this mystery like a pitbull.  The bombastic reporter apparently has spent time in war zones - Kosovo, Afganistan, etc. (and has the awards to prove it) - but practically wets himself at the sight of one man with a rifle, and apparently has no street-sense whatsoever.  The only remotely likable character is the KGB colonel trying to track them down, and he's putatively opposed to the \\"heroes\\" of the story.<br /><br />So I deducted a star for the fact that I didn't like the characters and found my mind drifting to the plausibility of the action in the final chapters, never a good sign when reading a thriller.

I didn't want another the  version with photographs from the movie--too cheesy.<br />Book quality very good but probably not same quality as 70s edition. Reasonably priced!
B002Q4TKAO|5.0|Hello World,         In the United States our educational system remains ignorant of the benefits and strong intellectual drive that Music, Art, and Dramatic interepretation have within our young minds.  Athletics have become the normally financial money maker.  However, now, in a world with 'Obviously so many people capable of much, much more talent; we sadly sod on with a hopeless dream, and our children remain intellectually inept, with rare exceptions; and, with no thanks to our educational system.  These individuals are like all of the rest of you: hoping that Simon Cowell !, or another smart seer will harness your talents.       This band did not find success untill it was discovered untill the Britons 'Heard' their 'Music'.         Wake up America- do away with the pretences and dream of physical greatness athletically, gives our musicians and artists a chance.  Support them and do not hinder their promise.         Nike, iPhone, Abercrombie & Fitch, etc, etc, etc:  consider paying it forward.  You 'Great' companies can do something to change this, and still make a profit.  Use your minds, directed toward giving our own people the chance to make and receive the benefit of your excessive benefit and monetary hoard.  Give our country the ability to make and survive independentally.  Do not send away our creative talents and gifts to other countries to benefit, solely.  Our, 'Bill', is too enormous to pay away now.  Stop and think.         This great land of ours will be bought out, and lost to us unless: Greed, Selfishness, Vanity, and a host of other virtue absent goals are abandoned.         I'm sorry, I just had to get that off my chest.         May God protect and bless our great nation always.  Amen    humbly submitted,  timothy
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This set is just great.  All six movies for a good price plus really good bonus features make for a great buy.  The picture and sound quality on all the films is very good, as would be expected.  Phantom Menace in particular looks significantly better than the DVD version did.  The case itself is beautiful and sturdy.  I for one am glad they didn't include all the same special features as were on the DVD set as I hate when they just transfer over the same features on a set I already own (i.e. Lord of the Rings blu-rays).  The changes to the movies were really minimal and didn't bother me at all.  Lucas has been making changes to the movies since they were first released in the 70's and 80's, it isn't a new thing and overall I think the changes make the films better.  Great release!
B003X73QA8|1.0|I have never thought a lot of the Grammys but each year it gets worse or continues to not be the greatest.  This CD is bland to say the least.  I am sure there are better CDs out there.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|I recently received this case and was pleasantly surprised. At first glace it doesn't look that big. That is until you start to use it. It comfortably holds my Cannon EOS Rebel with an 80/200 lens attached. Also included are two outside zippered pockets and one on the inside of the zippered top of the case. While they aren't large these pockets can easily hold an extra couple of batteries, lens covers, computer cable attachment, and extra memory cards. The case has a handle on the top and also comes with an adjustable shoulder strap. While I haven't had this case out in the field to really use it the workmanship looks good and it appears to be well made.     This case isn't one to take with you if you are wanting to carry multiple lenses. The interior dimensions really aren't built for that. If you are careful you may be ablt to get a second lens inside but there aren't built in dividers for protection. If you are looking for a good padded case that can protect your camera with a single lens attached and have a bit of extra space this is the case for you.     High marks for a good basic level case!
B003Q6D25K|2.0|I had such high hopes for this sequel to one of the scariest movie experiences - Paranormal Activity.    Paranormal Activity 2 is a clever sequel. It is more along the lines of a prequel/parallel story.  You are introduced to a new family about to be terrorized by a demonic force.    This family is related to Katie from the first movie in that Katie and the wife, Kristi, are sisters.    You learn more of the back-story of these sisters in that they conducted seances and dabbled in the occult when they were younger. You also learn, by way of step-daughter Ali, that their grandmother probably made some kind of deal with the demon and it is after Kristi's son, Hunter.    After the home is ransacked, they install security cameras all over the house. Every single time \\"something\\" happens you are witness to the same progression over-and-over. Outside, pool, inside kitchen, inside living room, front door, Hunter's room.    Every. Single. Time.    This is part of what makes this sequel intolerable and boring.    The beauty of the first film was that each night, you knew something was going to happen and it kept getting worse. It built a level of tension that you could cut with a butter knife. In this one, there is too much boring video of people walking around and that stupid pool cleaner.    There is only one redeemable moment in the film: when Ali is sleeping on the couch and you see a shadow creep closer to her and when it nears, she jerks awake. That was intense.    Everything else was boring. Instead of calling this DVD the uncut, director's edition, they should have called it: Paranormal Activity 2: The Extreme Bore edition.    They have left it open for another movie but I hope they leave well enough alone. Let's forget this sequel happened.
0385738757|3.0|Man this is a hard review to write-<br />First, I am getting fed up with all the \\"someone just knows what to do\\" crap but the total lack in common sense or perceptive thinking with character interactions PFFFT...<br /><br />I am hooked I NEED to find out where the hell we are going? What the hell is really going on?  Why? Who are they?<br />I do find this series to be confusing..  Not entirely in a good way either.  I do still love the concept, I wish the characters had more dimension and had more depth  with their interactions.  Muddled is a word that comes to mind-  So many things do not make sense at all.  I \\"get\\" that that may be a underlining goal for the series, but I feel by the time I get to the end and finally learn everything I will have forgottin ALL the little frustrating things before that were confusing, therfor never really getting the WHOLE large OHHHHH that is why punch..
B0034G4P7G|2.0|Between David Fincher directing and Aaron Sorkin writing, I figured this movie would have to be brilliant. It was not. The writing, acting, and directing all are good, but the movie bends over backwards to be mean-spirited.  By the time it was over, I had a knot in my stomach and was feeling disappointed.  This movie does not make my top-100 list by a long s hot.

1439190275|5.0|Over the last 6 months I've lost 50 pounds on Atkins.  I strongly recommend getting the new book as the material is much better laid out and the advise more practical than the original.  I am a completely new person and outside the expense of new clothes, I've actually saved money on food by eating and snacking less.  (I don't mind the clothes expense.)    The big shocker for me was when I got back my lipid panel, there was massive improvement in all tests.  Cholesterol was below 170 and LDLs at 100 (it was higher before Atkins)! My Fasting Glucose was well into the safe zone.  I eat eggs every day and bacon twice a week, also cheese and nuts.  There is something very wrong about the low fat high carb diet recommendations from the FDA and a lot of the medical community.  From my own experience the \\"conventional wisdom\\" is not wise.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely adore this series. The main character, Katniss Everdeen, is quite possibly the best written, most relatable, and well balanced female character that I've ever encountered in literature. What a gift Collins has given young women, as Katniss is strong, passionate, and caring. She has been struck with tragedy, forced into terrible unbelievable situations time and time again, and without a blink she will take her sisters place at the face of death. Katniss is not wealthy, not described as sexy or knock out beautiful, and she has been through so much in just 16 years, yet I would gladly trade places with her to be as strong, brave, skilled, and inwardly beautiful as she is. The books follow an incredible world full of adventure, sadness, and politically charged war. Suzanne Collins is brilliant and a wonderful and skilled writer, as I have never been glued to the unlit pages of a book at the crack of dawn, with tears streaming down my face before; the characters will suck you in, and you'll stay for either your love or passion for their journey or the excitement, adventure, and insanity of the journey itself.
0670022411|1.0|When I read the initial descriptions of this book, I was very excited at the promise of a historical and academic treatment of supernatural beings. The notion of a witch historian with a vampire who has experienced that history was at first intriguing. However, any semblance of logic in this book quickly falls apart. Ms. (could it be Dr., even?) Harkness would do well to sit down with her science colleagues for a basic lesson, as she gets even the most elementary biology, chemistry, and physics disturbingly wrong. In fact, the \\"science\\" she presents is so disastrously incorrect, I found myself slapping my forehead in dismay. Since the book relies so heavily on those arguments, it's a massive flaw. Apart from that, the main characters never fully break away from stereotypes and cliches (and yes, I withstood this thing all the way through). The sophomoric writing could be forgiven if the plot were better, but parts of it read like excerpts from a 13-year-old \\"Twilight\\" fan's diary (\\"his eyes twinkled like dark stars\\" and other such nonsense). The romance between the main characters feels entirely forced and is so unnaturally shoved to the forefront as to distract from potentially more interesting plot points. In short, bad logic, bad storytelling, bad prose, and a serious disappointment.
1603420398|5.0|I loved this book!!!! I used to look at \\"granny squares\\" as a vaguely interesting, but much too drafty and predictable motif to be of any use to me. This book, however, illustrates in a refreshing manner how any size, shape, yarn, or genre--from a Victorian to a Comporary style--can be achieved with the same basic stitches we all grew up with.  I look forward to utilizing many of these motifs in my next projects.
0393327655|5.0|A great book by a couragous author. I'm in my second reading of it. I reccomend that the chapter that deals with the \\"Dark Ages\\" of the Inquisition not be read before bedtime. I won't be doing that again!! What atrocities man can inflict on Man in the name of god!!

B001UV4XI8|5.0|I'm one of the many who absolutely loved the last film, The Half Blood Prince. IMO, it's a long book, but David Yates did what he could and gave us a fairly solid adaptation. And so it goes, we're at the end of the movie series. It's not a pleasant feeling knowing that we're at the end, but it's been a hell of a ride! And dare I say it, Hallows part one is definitely the best film since Goblet of Fire!<br /><br />Of course, there was much controversy upon the news of the finale being split in two, and I'll admit I was one of the \\"TWO movies? [...] that\\" crowd, but after doing some thinking, I realized it's a long book and so much important stuff happens, so after all, it's only reasonable. And I waited. And waited. And then, the showtimes for opening night got released, and I found that it was playing in the new Canadian projection system AVX, with wall to wall screen, rocker seats and crystal clear image and sound. So I went after work, a week early too, to go get my ticket, and awaited opening day.<br /><br />Needless to say, this movie did not disappoint.<br /><br />I was surprised at the amount of material that was covered. It was more of 75% of the book in a 146-Minute movie, and so I was pleased. This movie is also startlingly different from the other ones too. As expected, and shown in the books, the dark level rose with every book, and as seen in the trailers, this would be the darkest and grittiest. And my friends, it is just that, and thankfully so too. This basically strips away the glossiness of the others and gives us a rough, gritty, raw, disturbing and depressing feel/visual palette.<br /><br />Also, I normally detest shaky camera, as it looks ridiculous, gives me a headache and looks like someone with Parkinson's shot it. But here, it was used in the best way possible!!!! It actually added to the raw feel of the film, and suited the movie's dark tones well too. I was actually floored at how well done the shaky camera was, and furthermore, just how well done the film was.<br /><br />In short, I walked out tickled pink and happy, because this is the Harry Potter I asked for, and I got. I am absolutely stoked for part two. Bravo, David Yates! Bravo!!!rt, I walked out tickled pink and happy, because this is the Harry Potter I asked for, and I got. I am absolutely stoked for part two.

B000JQU4TW|4.0|\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is my first Oscar Wilde book, and I finished the book very happy that I had read it.  Dorian Gray is a young man, who has an incredible presence, due to his innocence and uncorrupted state of mind.  We are introduced to him through painter Basil Howard, who is inspired by the young man.  His acquaintance, Lord Henry Wotton, wants to meet the beautiful young man, and that is how Dorian Gray's demise begins.<br /><br />Everyone probably knows the premise of the book.  Where this beautiful young man has a painting that ages, while the Dorian Gray never goes through the aging process that everyone around him inevitably goes through.  The portrayal of how one changes over the course of a lifetime is seen through the life of Dorian Gray, as well as the portrait, which becomes more hideous over time.<br /><br />I did not give this book five stars, because I was disappointed in the character development of Dorian Gray.  I feel that Lord Henry (Harry) was fully developed through his \\"musings\\" which are common throughout the book, yet the book's namesake sometimes seems to disappears into the background.<br /><br />The Kindle version seems to be complete (at least to someone who has never read the book before).  A classic that definitely deserves to be read.
0312600844|1.0|Overwritten, overwrought, utterly insignificant, disgusting and nauseating. At one point, a main character is handling his own excrement. Why is this praised? Don't critics have standards? If this is symbolic of anything, it is simply of the author's intent to get away with as much as he can and still be taken seriously. Updike was able to shock us with his Rabbit books and say something about American culture. What is it that Franzen is saying? That there are some really messed-up people who can pass for normal among those that don't know them? He seems to be saying there is no morality. Is that an original thought in an age that gave us Cheney and Rumsfeld? Franzen's performance is as immoral as his characters. This book will make you angry -- at the author.

1892005034|5.0|This book is the most practical book I have ever read, and one of the most powerful.  I hate the title, because I interpret the \\"non-violent\\" part as being abusive... but this books is really about Compassionate Communication.  I think EVERYONE should read this, and am using it to teach my 2 and 3 year old how to communicate.  So often we focus on vocabulary and grammar, but don't realize there is so much more to communication.  I hope to get them grounded in these concepts early on, so they don't have to spend so much time having to unlearn or relearn as an adult.  I have read many other books, and they all offer generic advice such as \\"listen empathetically\\" which is great advice, but doesn't provide insight into HOW to do it.  THIS BOOKS IS ALL ABOUT THE \\"HOW\\" TO COMMUNICATE.  I really appreciate the examples, and 'homework' type assignments.  I was profoundly impacted by the lesson on taking responsibility for my INTERPRETATION of what others say.  Previously, I have been told \\"you give power to others to let them make you feel guilty, angry, etc.\\"  In this more [traditional] explanation, others still are making me feel some emotion.  Rosenberg helped point out that I really do have control of my own feelings - it's not what others say, it's how we interpret it.  I have control over my own interpretations.  There are very view jerks out there who are purposely trying to hurt us... why do we interpret, particularly from our loved ones, that they are trying to hurt us?  We should seek to clarify... \\"when you say that, using that tone of voice, I hear this ...  is that what you meant?\\"  Many friends have commented to me, \\"you and your husband communicate so well together... how do you do it?\\"  And I refer this book.  I would buy it in cases and give it away to everyone if I could.<br /><br />Regarding some of the negative reviews:<br />I find it interesting that one review comments this book doesn't give credit to any previous work.  I would have found it helpful if the reviewed provided additional resources to direct others too - whether we like the book or not - we could all use help communicating better.  Why trash the book, but not provide specific alternatives?<br /><br />Yes, it provides a list of specific words to use, but I found this extremely helpful and illustrative as examples discussed in the book, and not an end all be all list of words to use.  I don't think the author was limiting at all.iewed provided additional resources to direct others too - whether we like the book or not - we could all use help communicating better.

B003EY7IRC|3.0|I sit down to pen this review with trepidation in my bones. People are eating this book up with rabid glee then shouting it's wonders on the rooftops. I'm afraid my lone three stars will incite mob action complete with faggots of fire. So, please hear me out before you start the burning. I swear I really did like the book - at least the last third of it (and that's a whopping 200 pages!) and, if you will consider closely, I think you will understand if not agree with my observations.     The first 150 pages or so felt like I was personally experiencing the Fae levels of illusion and confusion in the Silvers. Soooooo many words, so little said! All Moning's (aka Mac's) existential ramblings and about- face behaviors were so convoluted, I had trouble staying on point - what WAS the point? It was so far afield from the Mac we have known and loved for four books, so opposite the usually tight, driven writing we've become accustomed to and just so... weird that I have to wonder if Moning actually wanted us to feel the imaginary realms ourselves. If so, she is a stinking genius! If not, she seriously slid off base for awhile.     When Barrens finally returns and the book actually starts up again, the red herrings become glaring and numerous, literally jumping off the page screaming \\"FISH!!!\\" What happened to subtlety? In her previous books, the twists and turns led us in directions we didn't even realize we were following until the \\"gotcha! moments.     In this installment, the word of the day was F*#@. That bomb was dropped so many times, I'm surprised the book didn't dissolve into a pile of ash. Isn't it in Creative Writing 101 that we learn to use a variety of descriptive words for a term? This particular activity has a myriad of colorful monikers, so it can't be for lack of them (and before you jump on the \\"she's a prude\\" parade, remember I had the same complaint over the use of the word \\"church\\" in a recent review.) It's not the word itself, it's the 170 times (slight exaggeration, well.... maybe) we have to re-read it. However, while we are on the subject, the F-bomb isn't church. The word illicits a shock effect anytime it's used - that's why it's used. Each time we read it, the sentence stops, however slightly. Over and over and over again, those small shocks really detract from the overall flow of the story itself. Moning's talent is better than that lowest common denominator.     Even with those glaring problems, I have to say, I LOVED the last part of the book! It was Mac and Barrens, the Seelie and Unseelie, the Kelters and Haven at their very best! The action, tension, twists and excitement were back and the ending was truly to sigh for! Really, couldn't have begged for a better ending!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I am always looking for something to listen to that is not synthesized and modernized. I came across this album in the new releases for my Zune and decided to give it a listen. I am in love with this album! The range and emotion is amazing and the song selections all sound different but are of quality. If you are looking for an album that you are not going to just listen to once then I recommend that you listen to this. My all-time favorite is Love Song (I know, it's not original, but I think she delivered it amazingly). I am blown away and I am about to listen to this for a second time! Purchase, you will not be sorry!

B003UESJHO|5.0|OK, you may think, \\"another boxing film about a nobody who becomes somebody\\", right?  Don't underestimate The Fighter as another boxing film.  It has heart and good acting, but most of all, it is authentic.  This film purposely avoids sentiment and going for easy, weepy moments.    Rocky this is not.  This pet project of producer and star Mark Wahlberg has been years in the making and the payoff here is a gallery of great performances by talented actors who do justice to their real life counterparts.      This true story centers on boxer Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) who struggles to be a junior welterweight champion with training by his half-brother and former fighter, Dicky Ekland (an emaciated Christian Bale).  Dicky lives his dashed dreams through Micky and has his own problems with drug addiction and other criminal activities.  The extended family includes a supportive father and a controlling mother, Alice (Melissa Leo).  Micky's life changes when he meets a bartender, Charlene (Amy Adams), who believes in him.  When the opportunity comes to take his career to the next level and work with professional trainers and management in Las Vegas, Micky's relationship with Dicky is jeopardized and causes a mighty rift with his family especially his `manager' Alice who feels betrayed.  To make matters worse, Dicky gets in trouble with the law and must serve prison.  He still lives in the past, clinging to memories of boxing Sugar Ray Leonard in 1978.  Micky is so torn when a seemingly winnable fight switches his intended opponent to one who is much heavier at the last minute, that he contemplates quitting altogether.  Riddled with guilt, he becomes reclusive until Charlene intercedes.  He begins to fight again and amasses a series of wins until he is one step away from a championship if he can overcome a challenger, Sanchez, and Dicky offers tips on how to fight him.  Faced with a chance to really make something of his career, Micky must choose between his new handlers andDicky who taught him everything he knows about boxing.  It could mean a championship in the end.     The film works on different levels of relationships: Micky and Charlene, Micky and his family, but most of all the film rests on the bond between the two brothers.  There is a good sense of family life and local flavor.  Micky and Dicky grew up local athletes and resident celebrities of sorts in a blue collar town where everybody knows each other.  When Micky and Charlene challenge Alice, there is a tumultuous change of dynamics and a tense battle of wills.  The best scene and also a turning point in the story happens when Dicky confronts Charlene about her own shortcomings, and everything in a way comes full circle as each person must look within to missed opportunities and not achieving their dreams.  It is an honest, pivotal moment that validates Dicky's character who, surprisingly, still knows a thing or two about boxing.  Ironically Micky and Dicky's scenes recall Marlon Brando and Rod Steiger as brothers in On the Waterfront also about a washed up fighter.        The fight scenes are quite convincing and well edited, and when you have a well chiseled actor like Wahlberg (The Departed), a kind of modern day John Garfield, you accept him as a boxer without question.  Bale (The Dark Knight) really inhabits his portrayal of a proverbial loser, and he looks the part having shed substantial weight.  Was this once the boy who enchanted us in Steven Spielberg's Empire of the Sun? Come to think of it, Spielberg has another young alumnus in Adams (Catch Me If You Can) who makes the most of her role as a bright, headstrong woman who supports Micky and butts heads with Alice and her daughters literally.  Leo (Frozen River) is quite good as the proud matriarch whose influence and authority is threatened.      The film tells its story as directed by David O. Russell (Three Kings) in workman like manner.  It's almost the kind of film Clint Eastwood makes these days.  The story and relationships are strong enough to easily carry the film without resorting to sentimentality.  Indeed, there is a thrilling moment ringside where a shot almost follows through with Alice and Charlene hugging, but Russell cuts away to another unglamorous shot.  Bravo for not taking the easy way out although there are a couple of scenes could have been extended more.  It's also nice to see the real life brothers in the end credits, and you know that the film has done their lives justice.  The original screenplay and story had a lot of writers involved, and the result is a heck of a remarkable comeback story and a family that would not quit.

B003L20ICE|4.0|The nuclear family takes on a different spin when both parents are same sex and the kids are the product of a male sperm donor in The Kids Are All Right.  When traumatic upheaval and revelations strike such a family, the results can be amusing and also tragic.   Annette Bening and Julianne Moore highlight an insightful script about domesticity turned on its head.      Nic (Bening) and Jules (Moore) are lesbian parents of two teens, Joni and Laser.  One day the children research and contact their biological father, Paul (Mark Ruffalo), who agrees to meet his progeny.  After an awkward first meeting, things actually go well as the new family connections are explored by the kids and their newly found father.  The couple of Nic and Jules are a contrast; Nic is the physician who is totally controlling while Jules is still trying to find herself with a new business of landscaping.  Laser hangs with the wrong crowd and begins to realize that he deserves better through his bond with Paul.   Joni is trying to assert herself as an adult and prepares to go to college.  The moms show a parental responsibility to watch over their children and want to meet the dad.  When Paul hires Jules to do work on his restaurant landscape, the two connect.  As Paul's influence begins to overcome the family, Nic feels left out.  But there is an attraction between Jules and Paul that leads to a torrid affair, and when Nic discovers the truth, the family is torn apart.  Into this mix are two maturing children whose emotions will be tested throughout.      The roles are well acted especially by Benning as a betrayed spouse, and in particular, her scene of revelation about Jules is a marvel of expressiveness and devastating heartbreak.  This culminates in a powerful moment with all the principals present at Paul's dinner table.  Moore gives solid support and shines in her heartfelt plea to her family near the end.  The ensemble is well cast particularly Ruffalo whose almost bystander role is suddenly elevated to catalyst and disruptor of the family's dynamic.      The story has a nice balance of serious tones and comedic elements born out of the situations.  The themes work on several levels like ingredients of a zesty recipe: the family chemistry, the couple of Nic and Jules, the kids' developing bond with Paul, Paul and Jules, and shake and mix well.  Everyone has needs and wants, and the strongest is a need to belong to a family and the need to connect with another human being whether it be Laser and his friends, Paul and Jules, Paul and his children, and Nic and Jules.  Amid the conflicts, no one escapes unscathed.  There are no real heroes or villains here, only hard truths about life and relationships.      The fact that two lesbians are having the conflict over infidelity may seem novel on the surface, but it could easily have been a heterosexual couple.  In fact the notion of two lesbians virtually disappears as we witness and understand this family unit with its warts and all.  It could be any family when you think about it.   The fact that both Benning and Moore play their respective spousal roles so convincingly is a testament to their acting skills playing off an excellent script by Stuart Blumberg and Lisa Cholodenko, who also directs.  The ending rings true and shows not only how far the relationships have come, but how that foundation, despite some serious challenges, is strong enough to survive.  Life moves on, and there is hope for the future.      There are not a lot of loose ends in this story although, toward the end, it would be nice to get a bit more resolution to Ruffalo's character.  The film does contains a couple of brief explicit sex scenes without which this would essentially be a PG rated film.  There is little to quibble about, and the viewer gets to experience one of the more insightful domestic dramas in recent years.
B004PFNQTI|5.0|Every episode gets hotter, more thrilling, more scandalous and I get more into it every episode! I can't believe this show hasn't even been through two seasons and has had each character develop into an amazing addition to the cast, except for Matt(he's still crying.) Fun, Fun, Fun! Its hard not to fall in love, too!
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Director Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler, Requiem for a Dream) has done some offbeat films but has always elicited strong performances from his leads.  Perhaps his greatest achievement is getting an Oscar worthy performance from Natalie Portman in Black Swan, a film that does an impressive job of depicting a psychological downward spiral of a competitive ballerina in the role of a lifetime.      Nina Sayers (Portman) works hard at her craft and gets the coveted starring role in Swan Lake.  Doted on by her mother (Barbara Hershey in an unusual role) and pushed to extremes by her ballet director, Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), she begins to feel threatened and becomes delusional and loses touch with reality.  A new arrival, Lily (Mila Kunis), understudies her and becomes not only her friend and night scene companion, but also her main competitor and threat.  Is she undermining her on purpose or is Nina just imagining it all?  As opening night approached, the visions become even more disturbing to the point that Nina is at the brink of her sanity and the curtain opens on the most important moment of her life.      Portman projects a complex series of conflicting emotions including anxiety, jealousy, and even guilt as if she does not deserve the lead.  Guided by Aronofsky, she soars as she has never done before.  Not only does she perform a substantial amount of physically demanding ballet, but we see things through her eyes and feel her pains. Does she really commit the horrible acts she thinks she may have done or is it all in her warped mind?  It's not a pleasant journey.  There is extremely disturbing use of mirror images that reflect Nina's face and become Lily in the next instant in jarring and unexpected fashion.  Is Nina seeing Lily or is it a reflection of her own self?  A moment that shows the various pieces of wall art at her home coming alive in nightmarish figures is truly unnerving.        Kunis as Lily brings enough menace to her role.  Winona Ryder has asupporting role of a retiring, vindictive ballerina, Beth MacIntyre, who ends up in the hospital.  A scene where Nina worships Beth is reminiscent of Anne Baxter and Bette Davis in the dressing room scene of All About Eve.  Beth is bitter and even self abusive which kind of foreshadows what awaits Nina.  Cassell is effective as the ballet director whose sexism and unusual methods are suspect but never his quest for the absolute best for his production.  Hershey registers as an overly concerned, controlling mom.      The film does a good job of showing the mental and physical toll that rehearsal and practice take on a performer, and to make matters worse, the angst exhibits itself seemingly on Nina's body in distorted and grotesque manifestations.  The physical mutations would probably amuse and please the likes of David Cronenberg and David Lynch.  As Leroy demands more than what she shows in technique, she knows she has to give everything in her soul and more to satisfy the ballet's demands.  There is an interesting dichotomy showing two sides of a ballerina's psyche with the repressed, uptight Nina whose frigidity is counterpointed by the free spirited and sensual Lily.  Lily evens brings out her sexuality and inner yearning that seems all too real, or is it a dream?  Something that is never mentioned or shown is if Nina is a virgin or ever had a real boyfriend.  Then there is the duality within Nina of White and Black Swans in which the dark side must emerge if she is to fully inhabit the lead role.      Much of the film recalls other memorable films that bend reality like The Fight Club or Affliction, and Nina's descent into madness has striking similarities to Roman Polanski's classic Repulsion whose woman descends into psychological delusions and paranoia.       Aronofsky's use of camera work is startling as it works in concert with Portman's performance, and when you see the change in her eyes near the end, it is stunning.  The film employs lots of handheld shots with cinematographer Matthew Libatique to visualize a subjective viewpoint for Nina.  The score by Clint Mansell is well done with a touch of foreboding.  Both of them are Aronofsky veterans.  The final scene as Nina readies to perform the last act as she morphs into the Black Swan to complete her transformation is haunting.   The final shot is unforgettable.  Some viewers may be turned off by its repellent imagery but others will be astonished by a powerful depiction of madness at any price.
B004BRP7R4|5.0|I bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it.  The production is amazingly clear and natural.  It puts the listener at total peace and slows down your day.  Listening to it driving to work makes you forget you are going to work.  Afterall, anything that slows you down and makes you think of the things that are the most important in life is priceless.  With so much meaningless junk on the radio now, it's refreshing to see releases like this!    This is a must have for your collection!
B00498YZH8|4.0|Winter's Bone, adapted by independent director Debra Granik and Anne Rosellini from the novel by Daniel Woodrell, is a small, low budget film with a courageous lead character.  This is one of those small films that features strong performances particularly by newcomer Jennifer Lawrence.          In a rural part of the country, a teenage girl, Ree (Jennifer Lawrence), raises her family which includes her younger brother and little sister.  While most girls her age are attending high school, she has to assume the role of sister and parent.  Life is grueling and tough for Ree who cares for her siblings even as her mother is depressed and dysfunctional and her father, who has had scrapes with the law, is missing from a bond hearing.   Unfortunately the family's house has been put up as collateral for his bail and is in danger to be taken by the bail bondsman.  Ree has to rely on the kindness and donations of food and supplies from neighbors, and when her home is about to be repossessed, her whole family is in danger of having their fragile world destroyed.  Threatened with her family's survival and determined not to lose her home, she sets out to find her father by questioning friends and family.  It seems that there is a little family blood everywhere, and people might know more than they let on.  Her uncle, Teardrop (John Hawkes), is a menacing, uncooperative person.  She follows leads that are dead ends and wild goose chases.  She is at the end of her rope and desperate. What can she do?  Is her father dead or on the run?  Her search leads to some really bad people who are local crime lords, and her punishment at the hands of those she thought were friends is graphic and ruthless.   Her situation is nearly an impossible one for anyone much less a teenager.  Then help from an unlikely source begins to shed light on the fate of her father as her family's future hangs in the balance.    Family is all important to Ree.  She is put in what seems to be a hopeless situationwith no options.  Undeterred, she will not let her family be broken up.  She has to not only act and think like an adult, but to grow up fast and also teach her brother and sister about the basics of life including hunting and cooking.  She cherishes her siblings and despite her dad's criminal background and what it has done to the family, she clings to his clothing and belongings especially his guitar which also serves as a symbolic bond with her uncle.  You ask yourself just what would you do in this situation?  How would you survive?  You respond to her plight by watching how she reacts to her circumstances.    The lack of a budget does not hinder the film due to its subject matter and focusing on the individual characters.  This is a very linear narrative with no parallel action.   Some of the dialogue which reflects the local dialects is at times hard to understand.  The unknown faces lend a very authentic feel as if these people really live this life.  The rural countryside is filmed as a very foreboding presence and is itself a powerful character. The film employs frequent handheld camerawork that lends an immediacy and documentary feel which work in the film's favor.  Even the film's colors are a darker hue which adds to the somber tone.      Lawrence really impresses in one of her first starring roles on film.  The story rests on her shoulders, and she is more than up to the task.  John Hawkes is believable as her uncle, and what's fascinating is his character's development and his dramatic changes over the course of the story.      It is a kind of downer of a film as the odds are stacked against Ree, and while Winter's Bone is not for everyone with its solemn, serious themes, for those willing to immerse themselves in an intimate, realistic tale of loyalty and survival and a young girl who bravely carries on, it is an inspiration.
0307454541|2.0|Not at all a thriller - though of course the author is talented enough to stir up my curiosity at times. Too many plotholes (Spoiler - I mean C'mon - you seriously expect me to believe that a photographer had clicked back to back images 40 years ago and Blomkvist used those to ascertain Harriet's reaction and the direction she was looking at).<br /><br />Overall a disappointment. But the 2nd book is absolutely terrible - Compared to that, this one was actually bearable.
B003UESJH4|5.0|As a document of a little known history of pre-World War II England, The King's Speech is a fascinating, heart rending dramatization of King George VI, who assumed the throne despite a debilitating speech problem at a time when his country needed him the most.  Well directed by TV veteran Tom Hooper (John Adams) from a lifelong project by screenwriter David Seidler, it boasts Colin Firth's (Bridget Jones Diary, A Single Man) best performance as the beleaguered king and award caliber support by Geoffrey Rush (Shine, Elizabeth) and Helena Bonham Carter (Alice in Wonderland, Room With a View).    In 1925, Prince Albert (Colin Firth), who is second in line to the throne, gives a speech through BBC radio at Wembley Stadium in England, and it goes poorly as he hesitates and stumbles his words much to the astonishment of the crowd.  He has a stuttering problem that is revealed in the most public and humiliating way.  By the 1930's in London, Albert is subjected to a multitude of therapies and remedies that range from speaking with a mouthful of marbles to smoking!  His frustration grows until he abandons any hope of solving his affliction.  His wife, Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter), seeks out an obscure, Australian speech therapist, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), who feels confident he can cure the prince.  A struggling actor himself, Logue has a playful sense of humor that does not ingratiate himself with the future King of England.  It is a humbling process, but he slowly brings the prince out of his timid and isolated shell.  They work on a progression of methods which includes utilizing recordings and headphones and delves into Albert's childhood.  The therapy sessions are not without setbacks but a bond develops into a strong friendship.  As 1936 approaches, King George V dies, and when The Prince of Wales (Guy Pierce) abdicates the throne to be with an American divorcee, the title and responsibility fall on Prince Albert who is desperate not to be placed in this position when England needs a leader.  As the clouds of war approach Europe, Prince Albert is named King George VI on December 12, 1936.  With England on the brink of declaring war on Germany, and a radio broadcast to all of England and the world, George summons Logue to coach him through the most important speech of his life.  With Logue at his side to guide his every word, George speaks to the nation.      Hooper does a very straightforward job without having to resort to flashy camerawork but instead lets his actors do what they do best-act!  This long gestating screenplay started with Seidler as a child stutterer listening to radio broadcasts of the king, and it was not until his widow, the Queen Mother, died that he had her conditional consent to tackle the story.  It does play a bit with facts but never loses sight of the core relationship of the two disparate men and how a common actor taught a prince to be king. Technical production is excellent all around from the impressive period costumes and art direction to the dramatic score and dark hued cinematography.    It is the interplay and war of wills between Firth and Rush that is the delicious center of this relationship based story.  Reunited after having costarred in Shakespeare in Love, both actors are at the top of their game, and part of the fun is that despite the seriousness of the therapy, there are humorous moments to savor.  Carter plays `less is more' in one of her more conventional roles, and she is quite convincing as royalty.  Some nice turns are made by acting royalty, Michael Gambon, Guy Pierce, Derek Jacobi, and Claire Bloom among others.       The story adds texture in the family details by revealing George V as a domineering father.  The troubles of George VI are shown in intimate scenes with his children as he tries to read a story but is handicapped by his impediment.  The documentary footage of Hitler's mastery of public speaking is studied with fascination and almost envy by George.  It isan ironic yet telling scene.  Logue adores his own family, and his down to earth persona is in sharp contrast to George VI's more formal yet heartfelt affections for his family.  There is a good contrast made of the King's life from that of the common man.  In the scene where George VI is crowned King, he must address his court and realizes that everyone, even his own family, will now treat him differently.  Life will never be the same again.  When George VI makes his speech at the end, we see that he is learning to be a king.      As a piece of history, The King's Speech is thoroughly engaging, but what makes it affecting is one man's triumph over adversity with the support of a loving wife and the friendship of a unique therapist.
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|All I could say when I finsihed this was - Thank God! the whole damn Salander thing is finally over.<br /><br />Many loopholes as I've already mentioned for the previous two books, and too many things just hanging around which had not much connection to the story. Too many loose ends left at the end too. The author, if alive, could probably argue that all the ends that mattered were tied up, but too much gibberish filled into the middle of the book leaves me weary. What was with the stupid mathematical equation. What was with the whole amazonian women thing. And way too many cliches with the whole gay/lesbian thing.<br /><br />If someone is searching for thriller, this is definitely not the series to try. It's a mish-mash of mediocre writing (much like my own review :D )
B0041KKYDI|4.0|Based on the harrowing tale of survival by Aron Ralston and adapted by Simon Beaufoy and director Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire, 28 Days Later), 127 Hours challenges the viewer to share in a difficult, life changing event that most people could never contemplate.  It's quite a feat to engage and emotionally move an audience focused solely on one person in one place.  For an actor to pull this off is a great testament to James Franco's acting skills and physical prowess as well as Boyle's ingenuity behind the camera.      In April, 2003, Aron Ralston (Franco) escapes the rat race of the city to go hiking in a remote terrain.  After parking his car, he goes mountain biking and then by foot deeper into isolation.  There, he comes upon two hikers, Megan and Kristi, who are a bit lost.  He tells them that the earth with its rocks and mountains is always moving.  How prophetic!  Aron guides the women and puts them on the right track after a brief adventure in a cave and a sparkling pool of water.  Later, he proceeds on his trek of solitude and, while climbing between a narrow ravine, slips, and as he falls, a large bolder tumbles and pins his arm against the wall.  Trying everything possible to dislodge the rock, he finds he is hopelessly trapped with limited supplies.  No one knows where he is because he was didn't care enough to mention it to family or friends.  He is a confident, even cocky explorer whose cavalier attitude changes through this ordeal.  He displays some amazing resourcefulness in such moments as when he erects a mini tent to protect his head from the elements.  As he waits in vain for help that is not coming, he contemplates his survival skills and evaluates his life and relationships.  Life is precious, and he must do whatever he can to survive even if it means the unthinkable.      The entire film works despite the fact it centers exclusively on one actor.  (The Spirit of St. Louis is another that comes to mind.)  Franco accomplishes the difficulttask by making us care for an arrogant, free spirit who knows no fear.  The film focuses on minute details that could easily be glossed over. The simplest of acts become a tortuous struggle as when his pocket knife falls and he must retrieve it while still pinned.   A drink of water from his ever shrinking supply becomes an agonizing death watch.  The flashback scenes give us some background into his family life and a former girlfriend.  He even fantasizes a vision of a boy, a son that he will perhaps have someday?  He regrets the things left undone or unsaid and resolves to make changes in his life if he makes it out alive.  The fact that we know the outcome does not at all diminish the agony we feel for him in close quarters and his determination to survive.  In a way the big rock is a kind of metaphor for his life. What should be a liberating journey becomes a test of survival, and as the hours go by and one day bleeds into the next, we become a part of his limited world complete with cracks of sunlight and an occasional bird or insect.  After awhile you wonder if we really see images he is seeing, or if it is nothing more than a mirage or hallucination.  During his ordeal he uses his mini video camera to document his plight and to report on his situation and feelings.  The camera becomes a sort of confessor for him.      Yes, the scene where he must separate himself from the rock is excruciating but never exploitive.  The subsequent scenes where he makes his way back to civilization and encounters other hikers are powerfully heart wrenching yet life affirming.  It packs a punch and wrings you emotionally as Franco finds salvation when all hope is seemingly lost.  By film's end we breathe a collective sigh of relief.  Yet it is the cumulative effect of emotions and our shared experience with him that are truly affecting.        Boyle utilizes handheld cameras and crisp editing to keep things moving along in a methodically paced narrative.  It is ironic at how thebeautiful landscape is in sharp contrast to the horror that Aron must experience.  The film may set a record for having the longest running time before displaying its first title card.  There is a nice epilogue which alludes to his prophetic visions from before.  This is not a morbid exercise in claustrophobia or grossness but rather a realistic recreation of the triumph of the human spirit against impossible odds and the bleakest of settings.
B001NLKT60|1.0|Ok. This is abosutely the worst book in the series - and I don't know why I chugged on and on reading it.<br /><br />But anyway, my chagrin aside - there are TOO MANY PLOTHOLES in the story - there are way too many sequences based on coincidences (SPOLIER - someone coming out of the door while that other person just appeared there or some nonsense like that, Blomkvist seeing the keys to Salander's apartment after 7-8 days - C'mon! - gimme a break and stop insulting my intelligence Mr. Larsson.)<br /><br />I would never recommend anyone to read it.
B004HWR406|5.0|As a chronicle of events leading to the creation of the social networking site Facebook, touching nearly every computer user in the world, The Social Network is a fascinating take on Mark Zuckerberg, a maverick, whose brilliant mind is matched by his arrogance.  Directed by David Fincher (Se7en, The Fight Club) from an excellent screenplay by Aaron Sorkin (A Few Good Men, The West Wing) and based on the book, The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich, this is a fascinating study of a success story complete with intrigue and subterfuge.  In this case, the incidents play on a very human level.  You would think this would make an excellent made for television HBO movie, but Sorkin and Fincher have created a remarkable, cinematic vision of an inventor, albeit a troubled one.    In the fall of 2003, Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) is portrayed as a computer genius at Harvard University with few social graces.  What we know now as Facebook had its modest beginnings as a response to a failed relationship with a girl.   Needing to vent some anger, Mark modifies a campus website and with the help of his buddy, Eduardo (Andrew Garfield), a concept is born for socializing on the internet.  When web traffic to the site spikes to record numbers, people begin to take notice, and a phenomenon is born. A group of Harvard students enlist Mark to develop his site with their financial backing, but when they discover that he is working on his venture without them, they become incensed and contemplate legal action.  Mark and Eduardo become popular `rock stars' on campus as the new Facebook spreads like an epidemic to other college campuses like Yale, Columbia, and Stanford.  Soon, the company approaches critical mass and the milestone of being able to monetize the site and turn a profit.    Napster creator, Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), reaches out to the growing network because he understands its vast potential.  Mark becomes enamored and captivated by Sean's leadership and vision and is drawn to Silicon Valley much to Eduardo's consternation.  But with Sean's guidance comes his lavish, illicit lifestyle which has potential consequences for all.  As the company expands to the whole country and becomes a global presence, it seeks more capital, and the ensuing growing pains will test friendships and lead to betrayals and litigation.  By the end, everyone is suing to get a piece of the action.  We're not talking millions of dollars at stake but staggering numbers that far exceed normal comprehension.      Jesse Eisenberg (Adventureland, Zombieland) is perfectly cast as Mark Zuckerberg, a high energy geek running around a snowy campus in his shorts and flip flops and is quick to respond to his critics with venomous sarcasm.   Making us fascinated with such an unsavory character is testament to his performance.   Justin Timberlake is excellent as the charismatic entrepreneur Sean, who is portrayed as a narcissistic, lecherous Svengali and mentor to Mark.  Andrew Garfield lends very strong support as Eduardo, Mark's roommate.        The film's pace is rapid and driven, not a slow spot at all.  Its structure incorporates flashbacks and flash forwards in a masterful display of film editing. The story works as a kind of techie mystery especially from the point of view of a legal deposition that frames the events of the past.  Every major player gets a scripted point of view Rashomon style.  All through the narrative, you keep wondering if Mark knows more than he lets on.  Is he naïve or is he a schemer or both?  Was the betrayal of Eduardo orchestrated by Mark or was it the machinations of Sean? It is never truly clear as to Mark's culpability.  This is success, but at what price?    There's very little to gripe about in this film.  A short scene with Eduardo's psychotic girlfriend is shocking but ultimately pointless. Were the filmmakers trying to show his poor judge of character?  Also, I noticed a scene where the actors talk in the supposed coldwith digital condensation coming from their mouths; so how come the extras don't have any? A major subplot showing Eduardo's initiation to the elite Phoenix Club never makes clear whether Mark had a hand in his acceptance.        With its fascinating subject matter, the script begs your attention and participation.  Sorkin has done a marvelous job of bringing a book to life and complemented with Fincher's acumen.  The dialogue is stunning in its blatant display of Zuckerberg's intelligence and rebellious streak.  The result is a chronicle of a techie generation with not one false note and a thoroughly engrossing screenplay that has Oscar written all over it. Fincher is proving himself to be a great director when given superior material, and his branching out from thrillers to more mainstream fare has been remarkable (as in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button).  One can only wonder the goodies that await movie audiences as he explores further.
B00005JLEU|4.0|Okay, I first watched this when I was seven, eight, maybe nine? I wasn't scared of any scenes. I watched it again at fifteen, and I was terrified 20 minutes in. Okay...the story..  Bratty Chihiro and her parents are moving to a new town. Chihiro is notably annoyed and unhappy. When they get lost on the way and go through a weird tunnel they find, they find a theme park with delicious food on an abandoned stall which Chihiro's parents eat, planning to pay when the shopkeeper comes back. However, Chihiro refuses and walks off, stumbling upon a bathouse, and some boy of about 14, who tells her to leave. Chihiro immediately runs to her parents to find they are no longer humans. Hence comes the scary scene. My eight-year-old self wonders \\"Who is this boy? What has he done?\\"  Chihiro learns that she is in the world of spirits, where she is an inferior human. If she doesn't want to meet the same fate as her parents, she must get a job at the bathouse, as she learns from the boy, known as \\"Haku\\", although he later reveals that his real name was stolen. When Chihiro gets a job from the sorceress that rules the bathouse, Yubaba, she too loses her name, and her name, meaning \\"a thousand questions\\" changes to \\"Sen\\", meaning \\"thousand\\". Only then does Chihiro grow up and become a diligent caring young woman.  My favourite thing about the movie by far is the relation between Chihiro and Haku. They are friends, and Haku tries to look after Chihiro, then when Haku nearly dies, the relationship switches, and it's time for Chihiro to help Haku. By the end, they..well, that's a spoiler. I reccomend this highly!

B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Just when you think Disney-Pixar animation has hit the ceiling, they come up with another engaging film. \\"Up\\" ranks as one of the most original tales the team has come up with, featuring one of the most unlikeliest heroes. Carl Fredericksen (perfectly voiced by Ed Asner) was a young boy who idolized Charles Muntz, a revered explorer whose discovery of a rare South American bird fossil turned out to be faked. Forcing him back to the Amazon, Muntz vanishes for years. Carl unexpectedly finds common ground in his dreams of flight & exploration with a sprightly girl named Ellie. In one of the most touching episodic montages I've ever seen, Carl & Ellie live out their lives together: From marriage to daydreaming on a grassy hill to the \\"Paradise Falls Fund Jar\\" (which keeps getting raided when emergencies arise) to Ellie's illness & subsequent death. Now alone, old and beside himself, Carl is facing the mothballing of his remaining days in a retirement home. What to do? Simple: The retired balloon salesman attaches thousands of colorful balloons to his quaint little home & sails off to Paradise Falls, the place him & Ellie had long ago dreamed of going to. Unfortunately, Carl has picked up a passenger cowering on his porch: Russell, a pudgy Wilderness Scout who's trying to earn a merit's badge for helping the elderly. Russell is soon driving the old curmudgeon crazy.   Upon arrival, Carl soon learns that this expedition is more than he bargained for as Dug--a cute dog fitted with a human-voiced collar--and \\"Kevin\\", the rare bird of Muntz's obsession--are along for the ride. Sure enough, Carl encounters the elderly Muntz, whose hero worship of him soon turns deadly once the half-crazed Muntz discovers Carl is harboring Kevin. And so, the movie's tempo shifts from a reflective, whimsical tale into an action-packed adventure full of offbeat twists & turns.   In the \\"adventure book\\" that Ellie leaves behind, she writes to Carl: \\"Thanks for the adventure. Now go have a new one!\\" And that alone sums up what the film is saying: Never stop living, and be there for the younger generation.   DVD extras include the charming & amusing original short \\"Partly Cloudy\\", and the new short \\"Dug's Special Mission\\", an extension of the movie's plot.   An animated film that will always remain one of Disney-Pixar's most special efforts!
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|I got a kick out of this film.  Now I admit that I'm a fan of all the stars and certainly that's a big reason why I enjoyed the experience.  Frankly it's why I wanted to see the film in the first place.  None of them disappointed me; they all treated their roles with just enough seriousness that you never get the feeling they're standing apart and winking at the audience.  And yet you know they're having fun.  With a big, dumb, 'splodey movie like this ('splodey, adjective, -er, -est, Full of explosions) if the cast isn't having fun, neither is the audience.<br /><br />Frankly, I don't recall much of the plot.  Bruce Willis has a telephone romance going with a tired, bored woman at the Social Security office (Let me pause here just to say how refreshing it was to see that his love interest wasn't some vapid young starlet, but a smart, interesting, age-appropriate woman, played by Mary Louise Parker.  There is nothing bland about this cast, not even in the love department.  High marks there.)  He's a retired CIA operative who discovers  that someone is trying to kill him.  They manage to kill his house, and he decides it's time to hit the road, pick up his sweetie, who is probably in danger, and go talk to the rest of his old team, all of whom are in danger, too.<br /><br />The rest of the film is them trying to figure out the who and why of the problem, and they do it with real class.  Really, if you're looking for some tasty mind candy, this is it.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Love this movie. It is an animated masterpiece. Adults, as well as children, will love it. It is funny, exciting and very endearing.
B004A8ZWT2|3.0|Sadly the Tourist was really nothing special at all. When you put these two huge names such as Depp and Jolie on a film together though, people will want to see it regardless. I'll admit I did. Beginning and remaining quite dull and predictable throughout, I found myself bored shortly into the film. Within 25 minutes or so I could tell that this movie was not what I had expected. Sometimes I do that, expect too much and become unhappy that it did not provide me with enough satisfaction from it. So I'd say go into this not expecting much, you'll enjoy much more that way. There was rarely any sign of action or suspense in the film providing maybe one or two \\"exciting\\" scenes where there was more than just dialogue between characters. The only actual treat watching this film comes from seeing these two beautiful people on the screen of their first movie together. I will not spoil the film for you as many would, just merely explaining my thoughts of it. If you read too much into my opinion and think I'm saying the movie is horrific then just stop reading my review on it and read somene elses. My problem was that with all the potential on the set and from the two actors, we got a very unitelligent, unsuspenseful, and quite predictable, dull adventure moview. If this film had any other two actors in it there would be no hype about it nor an odd nomination at the globes for 2010's best picture. The Tourist was somewhat interesting but overall the movie was nothing special and I would not he hurt if I don't watch this one again. I would advice a rent for this if you must see but don't recommend a blind buy. There really is not too much in this movie, it's just Depp and Jolie together in a film for the first time. I do hope maybe the next one will be a bit more exciting with them two in it. I would much rather reccommend Florian Henckel von Donnersmark's first feature length film [[ASIN:B000OVLBGC The Lives of Others]]. I hope I've been helpful..<br /><br />-Cam
0586045449|5.0|Excellent book of one day in the life of an RAF Lancaster bomber crew conducting a night bombing raid over Germany. Included are subplots involving a German night fighter squadron, a German early warning radar site, and the German town that is bombed by mistake. I have read it four times and each time it gets better.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|I am not sure why I picked this one in the first place. But, I am glad that I did because this movie opened my eyes to some of the practices currently going on in the northeast. I heard something about what was going on, but never seen what was really going on. This documentary does a good job of showing how things have broken down in the northeast, and how that has impacted people's lives. It also does a great job of showing how this is not new. It turns out that we have seen this movie before out west. This flick covers that as well. All in all, this is a very informative and well-done movie. Get it and enjoy!
1936594293|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is a novel to be read time and again to descipher new innuendos and witty remarks. The characters are beautifully crafted and the relationships they form complex. The novel remains an important social and historical commentary. It is an easy and charming book to read for young adults and rich and complex for those who want to re-read it.
B00192IV9U|5.0|I am a huge Michael Jackson fan, and when I heard a new CD was being released I needed to own it.  I was pleasantly surprised with the music on this disc and it fits with his previously released songs quite well.  There are upbeat dance songs as well as some slower, more mellow songs.  It is a great collection!
B001GCUO5M|5.0|Inception was a good movie, but its \\"older brother\\", Shutter Island, was even better. It has better twists and actually makes you think critically about the characters' sanity and perhaps your own.<br /><br />It starts with a U.S. Marshal, Teddy, travelling to an island with his partner to take a look at a mental health facility located on a remote island. A patient has escaped, and the head psychiatrist, Dr. Cawley, wants Teddy and his partner to find out what happened to her. While Teddy hears about how that woman ended up on the island in the first place, he starts seeing strange visions about his time in the military. And he constantly hears stories about the psychiatrists practicing corruption and violating ethical codes. What's right and wrong is a recurring theme in this movie.<br /><br />The story can get really confusing at parts. There was at least one scene in the movie that did not make sense to me even once I had sat through the whole film. Even the ending is somewhat ambiguous so the audience can come to their own conclusions. But I would say it's worth the watch. It's one of those few feature films that can lead to a great discussion after the movie.
0756405890|5.0|Easily a top three favorite series of all time.  Patrick Rothfuss has an incredible talent for describing things without becoming tedious.  I would recommend it to anyone willing to listen to me!
B002ZG99N6|4.0|Another take on Boston crime with a focus on a bank robber who ends up dating one of the women he held captive.  It's more about the relationships than the actual heists but don't worry you'll see some of those as well.  It's in a similar flavor to THE DEPARTED but that's a better picture.  DIALOGUE/CHARACTERS: B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B; SETTING: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: February 2011; MY GRADE: B to B plus.
B002WY65VU|4.0|This movie was a LOT of fun, from Columbus (Jesse) and Tallahasee (Woody) arguing over the 'Zombie Kill of the Week' to the running gag with Woody's obsession in finding a Twinkie and Columbus' rules for survival. The times Little Rock (Abigail) and Wichita (Emma) duped the guys were a total facepalm with a giggle attached.  I found the scene where the characters trash the gift shop a bit weird, so I'll chalk it up to a psychological tension release. Columbus squirting perfume on Tallahasee still gets me grinning, however. Tallahasee 'meeting' Bill Murray was hysterically funny (to me) and probably the best part of the film.  The most serious moment is when Tallahasee reveals his grief over the death of his son.<br /><br />Jesse's mildly obsessive, paranoid character was a fair match for Woody's pseudo-tough quirkiness, although his (Jesse's) performance reminded me a little too much of Woody Allen. An awful lot of 'F' bombs, though really not out of character. The 'girl' roles were fun and unpredictable, although Abigail's part seemed more two-dimensional than Emma's.  Good acting overall, and I recommend you watch it more than once.

B003D7F2O6|5.0|THE BEST DEPICTION OF LES MISERABLES I HAVE EVER SEEN. GERARD DEPARDIEU, CAN NOT BE BEAT AS JEAN VAL JEAN
B0015DROBO|5.0|It has been a long time since I have enjoyed a fictional series as much as I enjoyed this trilogy. Simply great story telling, character development and twists and surprises at every turn--I could not put any of the books down and was sorry to see them come to an end. There is a good reason these books have been so critically acclaimed, have appeared on virtually every major best seller list worldwide, been made into 3 highly successful movies in Sweden and why Hollywood is about to release a movie on the first of the books this Fall.
B003UESJFG|1.0|I think it's HIGHLY DECEPTIVE for Amazon (not to mention the commercial I just saw) NOT to put, in BIG GIANT LETTERS....THIS IS NOT THE 3-D VERSION YOU SAW IN THEATERS!!!  WHY even BUY it?!  Also, quite a few other reviewers RAVE about the, NOT INCLUDED, 3-D in their reviews.  BE MORE HONEST AMAZON!
B000LB7G00|5.0|The Space Navigator is well built and sturdy. It does everything I anticipated and more.    I mainly use it as a camera in a SL and it is a Machinama dream camera controller.  I gave it three stars and not five because of the ease of use. Extremely difficult to learn to control,     but with practice I am getting really good results. The documentation with the controller was ok,   but sketchy. It works with so many apps, and I wish I still had the trial for 3DSMAX to try it on.    Overall it's well worth the five star overall and I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again.. Still awesome, and   the navigation hasn't needed reconfiguring after two months of use. Another great product!
B000002UJQ|5.0|I feel like someone who has just shown up to a really awesome party and I'm playing catch up. I don't know why it took me so long to realize that Radiohead have more good songs to offer besides \\"Creep\\". I was reading an article on cracked.com and it mentioned Radiohead's albums In Rainbows and Ok Computer being intertwined to create one giant album. (I'm sure most Radiohead fans are already aware of this.) So I decided to download Radiohead's discography. I started with Pablo Honey because I wanted to go in order of release, and was blown away. The Bends blew me away even more. Next I listened to Ok Computer...and on first listen, I just didn't get it. Alright, I thought...I don't see what all the fuss is about. I moved on to Kid A, and immediately I was blown away. This was all in one night too, (the other night actually) I just couldn't stop listening to Radiohead. The next day I listened to Amnesiac, Hail to the Thief, In Rainbows, and The King of Limbs, and upon first listen fell in love with each album. Why hadn't Ok Computer have that effect on me? I decided to give it another listen. Nope...still nothing, I went back to their other albums. Then, yesterday...I gave it one more listen, and I can't explain it, but something just clicked...Now I'm hooked. I cannot stop listening to Ok Computer now...just today I've probably listened to it at least 5 times in a row. I just feel this connection with all the songs...and I wonder why I didn't feel it at first. I want to listen to their other albums some more but I just can't stop listening to this. Each song is just beautifully structured, and well...what can I say that most reviewers haven't already covered. This is actually the first time I've used my account to review a product because I just wanted to share with other fans the joy that listening to their music brings me. I don't know why it took me so long to discover them but oh well, now I have 8 amazing albums in my collection to enjoy over and over and over.
0312600844|2.0|I'm trying to listen to the book on tape (CD's) but i just can't finish it! The overall story sounds interesting and compelling but if I hear \\"self deprecating\\" ONE MORE TIME I might have to get myself a therapist. I buckled and read the synopsis on Wiki and after finding out what happens I don't want to really finish \\"reading\\" (listening) to the book. Maybe I live in la la land but my idea of relaxing and spending time \\"reading\\" a book on my morning commute doesn't include a story about depressing family messing up over and over again. And finally getting it right at the end. Oops did I give it away? Blah needless to say, I'm glad I borrowed this from the library instead of buying it.
030726999X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It is the last of the trilogy.  There were even more new twists in the story line.  I would have thought the plot would have gotten stale on the third book.  But, he continued to keep me intrested with lots of turns in the plot.  I enjoyed all three books.  It would probably be even more fun if I know any of the places that are mentioned.
B000FBJAGE|1.0|I have not read this book.  It contains drawings of floor plans, will fragments, etc that are relevant to the story.  This version does NOT include these.  So I'm sort of lost a few chapters into the book.  You would be better off getting the paperback rather than the electronic version.  I have asked for my money back or an exchange for a version that does have the drawings.  I'm not optimistic about either happening.  I really kind of surprised that Amazon would overlook this sort of thing.  Very disappointed with my purchase at the moment.
B004BLTNL6|2.0|When I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE was initially released it was one of the most talked about films of its time. First you had Ebert & Siskel on their weekly show discuss how terrible and disgusting the movie was. Then, once released in England on video, the film became notorious for being one of the original \\"video nasties\\" there (if you haven't heard of them google them. They make for an interesting mix of films). So was there a reason for controversy? Was the movie truly that disturbing? Having just watched the blu-ray release of the film I can only say yes, a feeling I had when watching it for the first time years ago.<br /><br />I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE (originally released as DAY OF THE WOMAN) was one of those films that you heard so much about that you had to find it and watch it. Controversial movies have always had that effect on the viewing public. It doesn't matter if the movie is good or bad, you find yourself drawn to it because of the word of mouth surrounding it. What surprised me this time around was that after over 30 years since its first release (1978-80 depending on where you look), the film still has that punch in the gut effect that it had the first time around.<br /><br />The story revolves around a young woman, Jennifer Hill (Camille Keaton) who leaves New York City for a month in the country to relax and write her first novel. She stops to get gas at the local station and meets the station owner, Johnny, and his group of friends. It's a casual meeting with no names exchanged and little happens. Later on she meets Matthew, a dim witted young man who delivers groceries, not knowing that he's friends with Johnny and his group.<br /><br />When Johnny and his friends get together, they begin talking about how attractive Jennifer was. After talking long enough, they decided that they want her and will indeed take her. The next day while she's in her boat on the lake, they grab the rope on hers and speed off with her in tow. Once they land, the group savagely takes turns raping her with the exception of Matthew.<br /><br />Jennifer leaves them behind, bruised, scraped and bleeding. As she makes her way through the woods, they find her again and brutalize her once more. They leave her behind here and she makes her way home only to find the group waiting for her. Matthew now among them, they convince him to follow their lead and he rapes her as well. Rarely has the violent act of rape been so convincingly played. This is brutal and animalistic. There is no chance that someone would find this erotic, unless they find something nice in rape. And it's these scenes that are the most brutal and disturbing of all.<br /><br />Matthew is sent in to kill Jennifer but can't bring himself to do so. Surviving the ordeal, Jennifer is now a changed woman. No long content to sit back and be taken advantage of, she plots her revenge on each of the group. Matthew is the first, seduced by the lake and then left hanging from a tree.<br /><br />While it's weird to say this, Johnny gets the most deserving act of revenge and one that will stick with you long after watching the film. ***SPOILER ALERT*** Jennifer seduces Johnny back to her place and while sharing a bath with him, reaches out, takes a butcher knife and cuts off his...well think of John Bobbit and you'll know what she does. With little or no special effects save for a well placed sound effect, this scene will make you cringe just like the rape sequence. Jennifer does indeed finish her revenge and the movie ends.<br /><br />As with films like HOSTEL I tend to find no pleasure in watching what is commonly known these days as torture porn. Anyone easily disturbed will find this movie incredibly hard to watch. Yes, the victim in the movie does have her revenge, but the fact that we're watching this forcible rape time and time again doesn't offer entertainment at all but leaves one feeling the need for a shower.<br /><br />Is it worth watching at least once? Perhaps. If you can stomach the scenes described above then sure, especially if you want to see it as a piece of film history. Amazingly the film, while made on a low budget, does offer some decent photography and is well acted for being made with unknowns. The transfer makes this movie the best looking version that's ever been released.<br /><br />As I said, I'm not a fan of the genre. But as I watched I found that while disturbing it offered a better story than I first remembered. For a low budget film it was quite well made, written and directed. But it still leaves you with that unwashed feeling.<br /><br />I know many people think that movies have to push the envelope now and then, to go further than they did before. That may be true at times. Then again sometimes pushing the envelope doesn't add anything to our way of life. And to call it art to me just denigrates art. You can probably tell I'm betwixt and between on this movie. Its one that you have to witness and make your own mind up about.to see it as a piece of film history.

B000FVNX2Q|5.0|I bought this for my Financial Management class ( I am an MBA student).<br /><br />Call me a nerd, but this is one of the best calculators that I have ever had.  And I have used many.  Graphing, financial, basic.  This one is easy to use and it is fantastically fast.<br /><br />It uses reverse polish notation, which can be frustrating at first but once I got it down, I actually prefer that.  Since this is the platinum edition, you can switch between RPN and the traditional Algebraic system.<br /><br />there is a reason why this one calculator has been around since the early 80's.  it does everything!  It can make amortization tables, compute bond values and it is easy to perform Time Value of Money either with simple button programing or entering in the formulas yourself.<br /><br />But because it can do a lot of financial calculations,the manual itself is pretty long.  the calculator comes with a short quickie guide, but it also comes with the full manual, which is a pdf file on a cd-rom.  The manual itself is 288 pages, (the length of a short novella!!!).  But you can easily search for what you would need to do.  So don't get too overwhelmed.
B0041KKYD8|2.0|Okay so the truth is there is no spitting nor are there any graves in either the original or remade version of I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE. The title was made by producer Jerry Gross for the original film in order to get film bookers in the south to book the film again, which had already failed in cut form under the title DAY OF THE WOMAN. With the additional removed sequences back in place, a take that MPAA attitude, a sensational and unforgettable ad campaign and tons of free publicity when Ebert & Siskel slammed the film (hard to believe Ebert could do so after watching his BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS which he scripted), the film went on to make history.<br /><br />And now Hollywood, in its never ending search for something new...okay no not new...in their attempt to remake every movie ever made, we get this latest version of the film. It follows the same basic story. Jennifer Hill (this time played by Sarah Butler) comes to a country retreat for a month only to be sought out by gas station attendant Johnny (Jeff Branson) and his pals.<br /><br />This time around the gang seems more backwater good ole boys than even the original displayed. Is it any wonder country folk have no use for big city folk when they are constantly portrayed this way? Anyway, the group attacks and rapes Jennifer more than once and in more than one location. ***SPOILER ALERT*** When she contacts the local sheriff to come to her cabin in the woods for help she learns too late that he's part of this group as well. Having been raped and sodomized by this group, Jennifer crawls home and plots her revenge.<br /><br />The same plotline passes here as she takes her time trapping each one and taking out her vengeance in the most brutal ways possible. While the rape sequences of Jennifer are as disturbing as they were in the original, the revenge sequences here take up more time than they did in 1978. Not only that but her methods fall more in line with today's images of torture than those in the original. The original was more about her just exacting her revenge with only one taking any amount of time. Here, she slowly does unmentionable deeds to each of her protagonists, with something especially disgusting in store for the sheriff.<br /><br />With more money to spend this version of the film has a much crisper look to it. The photography is well done, the acting intense and believable and the story continues to promote the genre of film known as revenge movies. Does it leave you with a bad taste in your mouth like the first one did? Yes, it does.<br /><br />Its one thing to make an original film and not know what the audience will think of it. Its quite another to take a disturbing film and make it over again, adding little more than well done gore and more over the top kill scenes. When released the film didn't do much at the box office. Perhaps that means that the audience for what is known as torture porn films is dwindling. We can only hope.<br /><br />Does the film offer anything new? Not that I could see. Yes, the performances were well done, yes it had a polished look to it. But is it a movie that you'll want to stick on the shelf next to BAMBI and MARY POPPINS?

0670050172|5.0|\\"Make Way For Ducklings\\" falls on the list of those \\"you'll never regret it\\" book purchases. A few books matter to children more than others. This one matters to me. The alliteration, the dance of the words is superb, yet the pictures are far from an afterthought.<br /><br />What we have is a group of ducklings, led by their fearless and protective mother, traveling across Boston. Trouble is, like children, they are tiny, and get intimidated by the bigness of Boston. The names of each duckling are alliterative and rhythmic. Reading this aloud will bring chuckles with the silly \\"Ouack and Lack and Kack...\\" all those \\"quack\\" rhymes.<br /><br />As a picture book with no social or political agenda, it is a delight to read aloud. Moms and Dads and big siblings will love going through the challenging duckling names quickly without getting tongue-tied.<br /><br />This treat for the eyes and ears, with beautifully drawn pictures and a carefully worded storyline, will bring your child into the Mallard family as they trek dangerously across town. A kind policeman helps them out, as do the people of the swan boat, easing the stress of the journey.<br /><br />Your library will have this book, but buy it. Get the hardcover. I still have the one my mom bought me in the late 60s or early 70s.<br /><br />Not only will the book be fun to read and reread, but it will teach a child language skills, particularly those relating to poetry. Even though it is not a poem, because it so well-written, it has those poetic qualities.<br /><br />When I visited Boston as an adult, I saw how familiar the town was only because I read \\"Make Way For Ducklings\\" as a child. The memories of this book are solid 30 years later, just as they will be for your son, daughter or younger relatives.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Make Way For Ducklings\\" by Robert McCloskey<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />[...]

B004CIIXC8|1.0|Unbelievable but the Criterion Collection Blu-ray presentation is in FULL SCREEN!  I just received this highly anticipated order from Amazon only to discover this.  What is this, 1985?  I would never have even considered ordering this if someone (like me) had bothered to mention this MAJOR detail regarding the presentation.<br /><br />It would be like ordering a Compact Disc of some highly regarded musical group and discovering it is recorded in MONO!<br /><br />I don't care how good or poignant or well acted or whatever glowing review a film gets, FULL SCREEN is UNACCEPTABLE.
159448385X|5.0|Don't exactly know HOW to review a book; however, this author grabs your interest right away. Subject matter revolves around the lives of two women in particular and it was so heart-wrenching at times, I had to put the book down and walk away to breathe. Inconceivable and eye-opening; how can the body and soul survive such tragedy? I do appreciate reading a book that encompasses the history of our times with the personal storyline that brings you right into their lives. Highly recommend this book.
0307588343|4.0|I read this book in two sittings and I could hardly put it down. Larry starts by giving us a look at his early family life. Right away I liked   this guy with his ambition and drive and hard work ethic. Nothing was going to prevent him from attaining his goal which was to work in the top  investment house in the world of the finacial market. I know very little about that world except on a very elementary level and Larry's explanation  of the products, terms and general workings in that industry is informative and intriqing. Of course the world finacial crises has always been a perplexing  case and I for one always tried to piece it together to explain this disaster that we would think could never occur. The book takes us through it all from the first  situations that got the house of cards to eventually fall. It could have been the dryest read around given the subject but Larry turns it into an exciting  adventure, a business oourse in finance and an awe inspiring story filled with real life characters who you just have to know more about. I found myself Googling names like Jane Castle,Erin Callan and the likes of Dick Fuld and there are more villains and some heroes still out there. Anyone reading this book won't be dissapointed and I hope Larry continues to write.

B000WD66BM|4.0|Oceanborn is the second studio album by Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish, and the first big break for the band. Oceanborn was considered a revolutionary album that introduced the world to a completely different type of sound. Even today, Oceanborn is considered to be one of the definitive works of the genre and Nightwish, and, according to band member and creative force behind the band Tuomas, Oceanborn is the band's truth \\"first\\" album, since he considers Angel Fall First to be somewhat of a demo. Epica singer Simone Simons has even attributed her interest in taking up opera singing to Oceanborn.    For more recent Nightwish fans, Oceanborn can come as a bit of a culture shock. Tarja's vocals are at there most operatic and classical, plus, there are numerous moments where you can't quite understand what she's saying or, as a native English speaker, it's obvious that Tarja has an accent. This is also being the use of a full orchestra and the male vocal talents of Marco Hietala, and some songs even include some folk instruments and go more toward a folk metal/lighter and more atmospheric feel than heavy metal. If you became a Nightwish addict with Once or Dark Passion Play, it can be tough to go all to way back to this. Still, Oceanborn has some wonderful music.    Probably the most well-known song on here is \\"Sleeping Sun,\\" because it was re-recorded and re-issued in 2007, and was being preformed up until Nightwish's End of an Era DVD. But, there's also the band's cover of the classic song \\"Walking in the Air\\" with Tarja's classical opera vocals carrying listeners through the song. Another favorite is \\"Passion and the Opera,\\" particularly due to the operatic trilling Tarja delivers in certain segments of the song -even though, at points, the lyrics are unintelligible or just pain don't make sense. I also enjoy \\"Gethsemane\\" with its strong musical presence and unexpected lyrics.    For Nightwish fans, Oceanborn really is a must-have. Though the band's sound hascome a long way from these humble beginnings, it's an important piece of their history.
B004G600A4|5.0|The songs are good, the singing is top-notch, the humor is plentiful, and the story has an underlying sweetness to it that is simply enchanting.<br /><br />You don't have to be a nine year old girl to love this movie.  The forty-four year-old me was completely delighted by this film and I look forward to watching it many times over.<br /><br />The movie is available in various digital media formats and with various bonus features depending on your purchase choice.  But all of that is secondary --  if it isn't a good movie, ultimately the bonus features are empty and don't matter.  \\"Tangled\\" IS a good movie and worthy of adding to your library.  Young and old will both find it charming, funny, and delightful.<br /><br />As a fan of all things Broadway, I was extra pleased to hear that Broadway veteran Donna Murphy was featured in this.  She is a great actress with a tremendous singing voice.  She brings a lot to her villainous role in \\"Tangled\\" and lends the requisite amount of dramatic weight to the proceedings.<br /><br />This movie ain't just for kids, folks.
B001C4AFOY|3.0|YOUNG VICTORIA is a lavishly produced and well-acted production. I loved seeing the accurate period details in this film: the clothing, the sets, carriages, etc. As mentioned the performances are uniformly well-acted, especially Emily Blunt & Rupert Friend as Victoria and Albert, and Miranda Richardson as the Duchess of Kent. It's a *lively* film.  It's well paced; it does move and breathe, and has some touching moments. I didn't feel that YOUNG VICTORIA was some blah, pearls-n-fur regurgitation of long-forgotten historical incidents, with upperclass British accents thrown in.<br /><br />I probably would have given this film 4 or even 5 stars but the thing that's bothering me after seeing it - and certain other historical films - is the unnecessary ignoring or twisting of facts for dramatic purposes.<br /><br />Now, I hasten to add, I know that a screenwriter has to make a story move along (and this one, to its credit, really does), and also has to make the story interesting to a general audience - most of whom probably are totally unaware of anything about Queen Victoria's life. (Actually, however, most viewers of this film probably DO have some knowledge of Victoria's life story, because let's face it, the early life of a 19th century queen wouldn't be interesting to today's reality-show-saturated younger crowd.)<br /><br />But - personally speaking - I found some of the screenwriter's choices very unusual. I didn't 'get' the casting of the important role of Lord Melbourne with a youngish, handsomely slim actor (much younger than the real life Melbourne), and the writer's choice to ignore the father-daughter aspect of the real Melbourne's tutoring of Victoria in the art of leadership. Instead of the true-life, fatherly/mentor-Melbourne, we're given a power-hungry young jackass who wants to control Victoria just as much as her mother did.<br /><br />And King Leopold of the Belgians, the uncle of Albert and Victoria, wasn't some infuriated puppetmaster pulling their strings. In fact, they valued his advice (and Baron Stockmar's, who's portrayed here as a robotic control freak who reads their letters, and forcing Albert to memorize Victoria's likes and dislikes). In fact the young Queen Victoria looked upon Leopold as a second father, and Stockmar was a trusted mentor and close friend of Prince Albert.<br /><br />Then there were the really melodramatic - and untrue - touches, such as Albert's attending Victoria's coronation (sharing a tender look with the Queen after her crowning), and taking a bullet for her during a carriage ride - which tidily resolves their first serious quarrel and is the key to Albert's getting rid of Baroness Lehzen, Victoria's old governess, who was jealous of the Prince. But in reality (and just as easily and interestingly dramatized), it was after the birth of Victoria's first child that Albert's issues with Baroness Lehzen came to a head. And it was Queen Victoria who didn't want to marry during the first two years of her reign - she was enjoying herself; enjoying her first taste of freedom and learning the ability to rule. She wasn't the conflicted young lady of the film; she was actually pretty headstrong and hard to manage. No persuasion was necessary from Melbourne to prevent her from marrying Albert - it was her own decision to wait a little while, learn her new duties, and enjoy some independence. (She also knew Albert was waiting in the wings.)<br /><br />But none of this is to say that this is a BAD film. I can see perfectly why viewers gave it the five or four-star ratings. I just don't see the point of resorting to sudden melodramatic (and fake) incidents, or ultimately pointless and silly tweaks of characters' motivations, in order to get at the audience's emotions. Although I never really expect historical accuracy from a film, I'm always pleased when I encounter it through a scriptwriter who's clever enough to make the FACTS live and breathe again.<br /><br />THAT'S my complaint: I guessI just want more writers to use facts in the imaginative ways that they use their fictions. It's just a little disappointing to me (and it's my same complaint regarding the recent film, THE KING'S SPEECH), that what REALLY happened isn't used and re-dramatized with the same compelling pull as the screenwriter's 'fictions'.I just want more writers to use facts in the imaginative ways that they use their fictions.

B000OLGCI4|5.0|Reading other reviewers complaints about screen ratio it appears to me that no one appreciates the philosophy of \\"bare necessities.\\" I guess I do though, because it doesnt bother me it wasnt released in widescreen, but still looks like an updated version of the VHS copy, which I had. So does Cinderella, play the same way, sooooo, so what. I'll say this one thing, Sleeping Beauty is presented in widescreen ratio, and I still use the ZOOM in my remote to bring the picture back to full screen. It seems I would rather be close to the characters, and the action, rather than appreciate the panoramic look. I think the portable dvd players, however, do manage to play with the panoramic look because of formatting. At any rate, these recent platinum Disney dvd issues are grand with multiple discs, extras, and places to choose besides movie. The package cover is 3D like and very attractive, almost difficult to throw away to keep just the discs on file, which I ususally do to most movies to downsize storage, but I have a special dvd rack for these wonderful Disney releases, and have no complaints about formats whatsoever.  There are books available on the art of Disney that present in printed form the final looks of most Disney animated films if one really needs to see the artwork firsthand.<br />Great extra of the animals that were left out, and how Walt hated the comedy bit profiled to one animal that was deleted by his account.
0740785508|3.0|Let me state that this is a \\"good\\" book, well-designed, professionally laid out, beautiful images of course, and created by masters of the art. But it is NOT a how-to book in many senses of what you might expect. Silly me, I had ordered this book due to my deep love of Photoshop cheat books and other books that allow me to use my \\"oh so average\\" computer skills and complete lack of artistic skills such as the creator of this book has to create interesting, fun, and believable images, logos, designs, and other visual enhancements. I had thought this book could supplement my knowledge of such techniques.<br /><br />Granted, the following is from the book's introduction: \\"This is not a book about figure drawing, anatomy, or perspective. It's not a step-by-step guide on how to draw dinosaurs. It's also not a recipe book for a particular paint technique, although all these topics are addressed in passing. What this book contains is a distillation of the time-tested methods that I've found to be most helpful for achieving realism in imaginative pictures.\\"<br /><br />. . . but to know this you have to already have the book in hand.<br /><br />This is a great TEXTBOOK if you are in advanced art class. This is a wonderful coffetable book if you want to show off how sophisticated you are in the concepts of high-fantasy. If you design science fiction book covers you must own this book, as most of the sci-fi book cover images I see in stores need a thorough reworking of the art to make it more believable--which is the basis of this book's premise. In that sense it is a great book, and if you know the author personally or read his blog, study his works, you will know this. For the rest of us however it is imperative to understand what you are getting into before forking over twenty five bucks (Amazon currently has it on sale for just under $17) on a book that will not help you increase your PS or inherent artistic skills.<br /><br />This book will encourage you to seek more detail in the life around the boundaries of the image you are presenting. \\"Why\\" is the red dragon angry and vomiting down clouds of golden flame on the village? \\"What kind of\\" chickens actually live in that hen house? James Gurney is not just some over-talented art machine. He is an investigator, a researcher, a philosopher of art. This will appeal to some serious art students and it will bore others, who are more focused on technique, to death. Unfortunately I fell in the later category.<br /><br />Please do not feel intimidated if you read this book and find it does not sing to you. Obviously if it does you can write a 5 star review and tell the world of it's holiness; but let's be pragmatic here. The cover and title do lend themselves to budding artists and art students who want to leap ahead and paint beautiful scenes of mythical creatures romping and playing. But it will be of less value to many beginning to intermediate artists than an extra set of brushes or some sketch pads to practice with. This book is abstract even as it tries to explain the process of abstraction. Without in-person guidance to accompany it I fear this book will most likely sit on the shelf--albeit a nearby one, but I doubt it will be cracked open more than once every few months. Great book, but very narrow focused market. Best used with instruction to clarify, with a heavy dose of questions and answers.<br /><br />As always, thanks for reading.oundaries of the image you are presenting. \\"Why\\" is the red dragon angry and vomiting down clouds of golden flame on the village? \\"What kind of\\" chickens actually live in that hen house?

B000QJLQY4|1.0|This is a protest review - hence the one star rating.    The publisher has forced Amazon to charge MORE for the Kindle version of this book than the hardcover price.    This is well within the publisher's rights - and it is well within the public's rights to call them out on it.    The old publishing model is dying. No one is more clear on this than Guy. I'm shocked that he is invovled with a publisher that would use these heavy-handed, near-sighted, dead-end tactics. Bad jusgement imho.    Attention Kindle and other eBook owners. Call out publishers when you see this - and vote with your dollars.    ^Carl.
0740797719|5.0|James Gurney gives us another generous look into his method of working, and this is an excellent guide for a beginning painter. Not so much about technique, but about method and practice and much to do with working with color. A perfect combination with Imaginative Realism.
0525951652|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Ken Follett and this book did not disappoint.  Set in Europe in the years between 1911 and 1925 this historical novel fills in the human blanks between the dates and names that generally make up history classes.  It puts paid to the complaint that history is boring.  I love Follett's characters who create a rich tapestry for history to maneuver over and around.  The richness of the Guns of August coupled with the stupidity of the war and the pain of the Wiemar years.  I recommend this for history students - the research is impeccable. I particularly liked how ignorant everyone was going into the war.[[ASIN:1609114337 The Tranquillity Initiative]]

B001HOF8AA|4.0|Imelda May is an incredible talent with a great range in her voice. She can go from sultry siren to growling rockabilly.<br /><br />She is backed by a talented group of musicians specifically an acrobatic upright bass player and an aggressive, chicken-picking, hollow body guitar virtuoso.<br /><br />The songs are all good with there being a wide variety of style yet always hovering over the genre of rockabilly. \\"Johnny got a boom, boom \\" is the highlight. It's a scorching rocker that starts out slow and rapidly picks up pace. May begins the song by gently singing the chorus but ends the song belting it out from her gut. This is a killer song! \\"Knock 123\\" is a classic, slow burning, Billie Holiday- type jazz tune where she expresses subtle emotion. \\"Falling in love with you again\\" belnds a gospel structure with stripped down, rockabilly instrumentation.<br /><br />I love this type of music and would love to see great things to come from this Irish talent. Unfortunately, this type of music only attracts a limited audience and unless you are a fanatic about music (like your or me...why else would you be reading this review?) she is (probably) only going to be a fringe artist in the U.S.  What a shame!
B004BLJQOK|1.0|The original is far superior!<br />Let the Right One InLåt den R&auml;tte Komma In(2008) R<br /><br />Even though this is almost a shot for shot remake,it lacks the quaint charm of the original. The two children are both outcasts and there is a sweetness about their relationship that is not present in the remake. The original did not have the Satanic overtones as this film does. Why the filmmaker thought he needed to set this film in the 1980s, I'll never know. It is just distracting. Just because there is a Rubik's cube doesn't mean you need to set your film in the 1980s.<br /><br />The pacing of the original is slow but that is how their narrative unwinds and it could be a European non-Hollywood thing. And perhaps the slow pace of the original is meant to be a character itself the isolation of cold dark Scandinavian winters. This remake is slow because the filmmaker cannot tell his own story and is literally using the same shots to make this film without good character development or plot development.<br />I would not classify the original as a Horror film in the American sense of slasher/satanic films as this one is.<br />Do your self a favor and rent/buy the original.<br />[[ASIN:B001MYIXAC Let The Right One In]]

B004L3AQFG|5.0|I vaguely remembered the story of Aron Ralston from around 2003; he was the hiker who fell into a crevice and was trapped by a boulder that clamped his arm in place. After 5 days or so, Ralston finally freed himself by severing his own arm. It was a story of courage, but it also make me wonder why Ralston was on his own without having let anyone know where he was going.     Director Danny Boyle's wonderful new film 127 HOURS explores both sides of the story, resulting in a deeply felt character study that is riveting, exciting and paced like an action-thriller. While much of the movie is, by necessity, confined to a single location...it never feels claustrophobic or static. In fact, the film soars.     Boyle introduces Ralston as a happy-go-lucky young adult, apparently economically comfortable who is charming, helpful and utterly winning. He's also self-centered in the way only young adults with few economic or family cares can be. He does what it occurs to him to do. He's smart & funny. He's enamored of the great outdoors and of pushing himself physically.     And when his accident befalls him, those qualities help him survive and help him to self-reflect. He's trapped in a deep hole with just a few supplies. He in a deeply uncomfortable position and he's pretty clear-headed about just how much trouble he's in. His intelligence allows him to access his dire circumstances. His humor allows him to be bemused by himself and to leave some scathing videos of self-assessment behind. Boyle shows us the physical situation Ralston is in...but where the film truly succeeds is by showing us the psychological journey he takes. The two work hand in hand. As Ralston grows weary, tired, hungry and very thirsty, his mind begins to play tricks on him. In many ways, the film takes the old cliché of \\"his life passed before his eyes\\" and shows how Ralston's several days of dire, boring confinement allow him to see his life and to reflect on his successes and failures. He never weepswith despair over his fate...he is more bemused by his own hubris.     All of this is presented with tremendous visual flair. First, Boyle shows us the country...gorgeous and empty. You can see why a young man would want to bike and hike and climb all over this natural playground. He also edits with a feverish pace (not MTV-style editing, where you are asked to notice it, but in an organic way). The use of color is impressive as well... Boyle has always had a knack of using filmstock and processing to help him tell his stories. SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE showed this on a grand scale...127 HOURS on a modest but equally impressive level.     But I've save the best for last. Boyle has the impressive skills of the immensely likeable and instinctive James Franco in the role of Aron. He has a disarming ease in his performance. When we see the less impressive sides of Ralston, we never cease to care about this young man, because Franco has infused him with believable life and enthusiasm. It seems like a simple performance...but it's actually loaded with complexity. But Franco never labors over his acting...it seems to flow.     Everyone knows that Ralston amputated his arm, and those brief scenes are as brutal and hard to watch as anything I've seen on film. But they are NOT exploitative in any way. By the time this comes around, we're actually ROOTING for Ralston to succeed in his grim task. And the film is more about the journey leading us to this moment than the moment itself.     127 HOURS is a delightful surprise. Boyle is an outstanding filmmaker and Franco is a very capable actor...but they have taken the elements of what would sound like a rather lurid \\"TV movie-of-the-week\\" subject and turned it into a life-affirming, even uplifting drama. It's a must-see.
B0017OB12O|5.0|Appearing like a shoot-em-up war film, this is actually one of the best cinematic character studies ever recorded. Acting is top notch, scenery (shot in Ceylon)superb, and not given to gratuitous action. Pay particular attention to Jack Hawkins (Major Warden) as Commander Shears'(William Holden) true identity is found out. Also of note, is Sessue Hayakawa's (Colonel Saito) brilliant performance. The Blu Ray remastering makes a tremendous difference even from the original Dvd quality, and better than when shown in the theaters. A bit pricey, but absolutely worth every cent.

B0015DYIH2|5.0|I loved this book. This is actually the first of the twilight series of books I have read. I saw all three movies and wanted to see what would be happening next so I got this book and loved it. Action packed and the romance is still great and the thing that keeps me coming back for more. I am actually sad this is the last of the series. After seeing how much I enjoyed this book and how fast I read it cause I couldn't stop, I started reading from the first book. The only one I haven't gotten to yet was Eclipse but that is next. I just love Edward. I like Jacob too but Edward is my pick. I am in my early 40's and I don't think it is just for teens at all.

B000069I1H|1.0|Rather than collaborate on a film of substance, Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy humiliate themselves in a lame \\"action-comedy\\" from the Hollywood assembly line.

0143038419|5.0|this is the hilarious and touching story of a woman brazen enough to indulge herself and brave enough to tell the rest of us about it! indulgence in this sense, especially for many american women it seems, is nearly taboo. we live in a culture of high expectations, demands and stress, which creates a great deal of angst for many. i'm not supporting everything gilbert did in the book, but we all have our opinions and excellent reasons for them, at least in our own minds. nonetheless, this book represents a delightful tale of a woman who really needed to search for everything to find herself. through the ups and downs, she finds a greater self-definition and understanding of her character. most importantly, she finds peace.<br /><br />i think the word \\"pray\\" in the title may have led people to believe the book would be something it fully is not. the title is reminiscent of the Scripture regarding hope, faith and love (1 Corinthians 13:13). though not literally in the title, hope is inherent in a search for anything. it is a motivating factor behind the initiation of gilbert's journey and is present throughout it. gilbert does express a belief in God early in the book, which is refreshing. my Christian faith, of course, leaves me wishing she also believed in Jesus as the Son of God and Our Savior, but this is not to be.

B0012GMZA4|5.0|I liked this album a lot, great songs up and down the list, which is to be expected.  When I read other reviews about the remixing that was done I went and tracked down a cd from before the remaster.  Had to get it from Japan of all places.  Anyway, there are definitely some differences.  The remastered version is \\"louder\\" but I felt like on the original one the vocals seemed more centered and up front in some places.  \\"Ain't too good\\" had a different intro, new version was guitar, original was keyboard heavy.  Also, the remix was way too heavy on the bass IMO.  So I guess I would agree with others in that they should have remastered it but not remixed it.  Now I need to get an older copy of Jinx and compare it too.

BUY IT! It is truly EPIC!
B0046MOVD0|1.0|And no, I'm not talking about the Resident Evil franchises' ability to frighten its audiences. After four (!) installments, it has become clear that these aren't horror films. These are sci-fi action films. I'm done asking these films to scare me. In fact, I'm done trying to look for anything of any merit in these films. But why watch and review them, you ask? Because it's so much fun to verbally kick in the teeth of the people who inexplicably love these movies enough to warrant more sequels for this franchise. And for the record, I didn't pay a dime to watch this movie, I borrowed my sister's Netflix copy. I resolved not to give the thieves they call producers any of my money long ago. So, let's start the thrashing, shall we?    This film picks up with all the Alice clones launching a full-scale assault on Umbrella Corporation's home office in Tokyo. Albert Wesker, Umbrella's HNIC, manages to escape, but not before encountering the real Alice on his escape chopper. They tussle, and he injects her with some formula that strips Alice of all her cool powers. The chopper crashes, and though we never see if Wesker makes it out (though you know he does), Alice survives. Wait, how did she survive the fiery crash without her powers? Why, with the aid of slow motion, of course! Who needs telekinesis when the world simply slows down to a crawl for you, giving you plenty of time of avoid any kind of physical harm, no matter how deadly and perilous the situation? I guess the T-Virus pandemic has affected the laws of physics and the space-time continuum as well. Great Scott!    Anyway, Alice somehow makes it to Alaska, only to find the safe haven known as \\"Arcadia\\" to be nothing more than an empty beach. She runs into her pal Claire Redfield, who has some metallic insectoid mind-control device stuck to her chest. After removing it, Claire starts to come to her senses, though her memory is a little fuzzy. Good thing Alice is an expert when it comes to amnesia, since Alice seemsto be stricken with amnesia in just about every film in the series so far. So the girls put on their traveling pants and head for Los Angeles, which is a burning wasteland. Somehow, all the buildings are still burning and there are still zombies years after the initial outbreak. Logic would dictate that these walking corpses would have starved to death (or back to death) without anything to eat, and the flames would have also died off. But oh, I'm bringing logic into this review. I keep forgetting that logic does not exist in the Resident Evil dojo.    They come across a handful of survivors who have taken refuge in a prison. Among these survivors is Chris Redfield, Claire's brother. What are the odds that two siblings who haven't seen each other in like FOREVER would both survive a zombie apocalypse and run into each other? That sounds highly illogic....OW! Sorry, I just slapped myself. No logic, remember?    So the refugees concoct an escape plan when it is discovered that Arcadia isn't a place, it's a tanker boat. The ship has set up off the L.A. coast, so Alice and company resolve to head for the ship. Of course, that's easier said than done when there are millions of zombies waiting to tear you apart outside. Oh, and the zombies have now developed tendrils that come out of their mouths and the ability to burrow through the ground. And there's a big dude with a burlap sack over his head dragging an ever bigger ax/meat tenderizer with him. Where'd he come from? Ah, just don't bother to think about it.    So most of the survivors (see: disposable fodder) meet a gruesome end and Alice, Claire, and Chris make it to the vessel. Turns out, Arcadia is a clever (see: predictable) ruse pulled off by Umbrella to round up survivors to experiment on. And who's on the ship? Wesker! Dun dun DUN! Now Wesker wants to eat Alice. Yes, he states his need to digest her. See, he's infected himself with the T-Virus but has managed to control it to an extent, but it's slowly taking over. He wants to chomp Alice because her DNA was strong enough to control the T-Virus, so if he eats her, he'll be able to control the infection within himself. (Why he doesn't bother to try eating her back on the helicopter is never explained.) Get that? No? Well who cares anyway? It's fight scene time!    They tussle, and though Wesker pulls off some wonderful bullet-dodging and acrobatics that would make Neo cream his trench coat, he ultimately takes a lead sandwich from our heroes. But since even bullets can't keep him down, he gets to anothah choppah and flees. But luckily, Alice has planned for this contingency and hidden a nuke on the craft. Ka-boom!    Alice and the Wonder Twins have saved the day. OR HAVE THEY? Swarms of Umbrella choppers approach the Arcadia (loaded with Umbrella soldiers the company seems to magically pull out of their posterior despite the fact that most of the world's population has been turned into zombies), one of which is helmed by mind-controlled Jill Valentine. And so, we get the set-up for yet another unwanted yet inevitable sequel.     In short, these movies are nonsensical crap. AVOID. DO NOT WANT.

B000000OU0|4.0|Item was in good condition, as described.  There are minor scratches on the cd, but didn't affect the sound quality too badly.  Shipped quickly!  Will definitely shop with again.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I have tried to read the Kite Runner many times and can never get through it. Even though this book is by the same author, I feel it is imposible to put down. Reading this book made me so attached to the characters. This book is epic. It teaches you Afgan history along with the story. From communision to the Taliban you learn it all. It is very endering and even though it doesnt have the happiest ending, you will find happiness in it.
B003Q6D25K|3.0|\\"Paranormal Activity 2\\" is a prequel to the horror film released in 2009. The new chapter, which takes place several months before the events described in the first entry, revolves around Kristi Rey (Sprague Grayden), sister of the original's heroine Katie (Katie Featherston), and Kristi's family - Daniel (Brian Boland), his teenage daughter Ali (Molly Ephraim) and a baby named Hunter.    The basic storyline is almost the same as the first installment. In a sense this is not surprising. Perhaps the producers thought (rightly) that they had to turn the previous year's surprise hit into a franchise quickly. So in \\"PA2\\" scares sometimes look recycled, using unexpected loud sound and moving objects. Despite the new characters (and a dog), sometimes I felt as if watching a remake, not a prequel, of the earlier film.    The story of \\"Paranormal Activity 2\\" (especially its introductory part) unfolds at a faster speed. With footage ostensibly shot by the family's camcorder and several surveillance cameras installed in the house, the film tries to retain the same visual touch as the first one, but the tighter editing and more polished camerawork (and special effects) suggest a bigger budget and professional skills behind the supernatural phenomena.     That is not bad thing. \\"Paranormal Activity 2\\" delivers what it promises to deliver. Only that novelty is gone.
044654759X|5.0|I loved loved loved this book.. I couldn't put it down.. I would always say just one more chapter then its bed time.. okay just one more..
B004APVI1G|2.0|The visuals are gorgeous, I agree. But the dialog and plot are so sappy and cliche that it's extremely difficult for anyone over the age of ten to watch. Take every plot device from any archetypal fantasy film, throw them together, and that's the plot for this movie.    My seven and nine year olds did enjoy it but it was sheer torture for me to sit through it. Buy it for your kids if you must but make them watch it when you're not around. The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is because my kids did enjoy it. But, tellingly, they didn't ask for it on blu-ray.
1433521784|5.0|There is only one other review on this bible and I did not purchase this one based on that review because I knew better. The beautiful soft leather cover will stand the test of time. The gold gilded edges are different from most bible that rub off a little bit over time. The gold stamping on the spine is heavy and deeply printed into the leather. I can only assume the other customer got a bad one, which can be returned to Crossway for another at no charge. I love this bible, it is perfect!
B003R0LBVW|1.0|Was this book checked by a real editor? Or editing is not for Mr. Franzen? 300 pages too many. All the environmental stuff is pretty childish

B004HWT6DO|5.0|This movie deserves to be watched at least once. Good acting. Nicely portrayed contagious dynamism and entrepreneurship of the silicon valley. Not sure how factual it is, but entertaining for sure.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|It is the classic of a puppet movie since it is so expensive to make a movie like that. It is collectable and it makes you laugh over and over.
B000009RC2|5.0|I think this is the best Mahavishnu album. It plays as fresh in 2011 as it did when released. The diversity of the mix of cuts is superb. Meeting Of The Spirits creates the atmosphere of persistent intensity and beauty. The successors range from pastoral landscapes to crashing conflicts.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I've been putting off reading this book, as I know it's been out quite a while and made a big splash in the sci-fi, YA publishing world. But I'm so glad I finally got around to reading it.<br /><br />The writer's style and themes remind me of YA great, Robert Cormier. Adults are not to be trusted, children are constantly understimated, and many times, the hero really does not \\"win.\\"  I saw all of these elements in Enders Game, and it made for a very realistic story.<br /><br />And I want to defend Card and the whole \\"undrealistic\\" criticism he has received concerning the way the children act, speak, and think in this book. These kids are beyond gifted. They are true geniuses. And if you've ever been around such children, you would know that the portrayal of these kinds of children in the novel is absolutely spot-on.<br /><br />My son is also gifted, and at 5,6,7...and now 10 years old, I was always able to speak to him like an adult. We don't speak about \\"adult\\" topics, but the vocabulary and depth of conversation I can have with him and his other gifted friends is probably even more involved than the conversations I have with my fellow adults.<br /><br />I was also a high school English teacher, so I worked with many gifted young kids from age 12 on up.<br /><br />I want to thank Card for giving such an accurate portrayal of gifted children. And judging from many of the comments on here, many adults will ALWAYS underestimate even the brightest of children.
0756405890|5.0|I'm typically I'm an \\"action\\" type of fantasy man.  I'm not saying that it is missing here, it's, in my opinion, just not the main focal point of the book.  That being said somehow the author, the characters, and the story draw you in and keep you reading with lighthearted, comical, and realistic (when appropriate) situations.  Great read, worth the money.  I'm paying (again as I lost the original in my last move) to have it for my kindle in prep for the sequel
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I will add my voice to the outraged and indignant chorus of people who are sick and tired of Lucas releasing, re-releasing, and re-re-releasing these films without what he damned well knows we all want:  Unblemished, restored versions of the original theatrical releases of '77, '80, and '83.  Lucas claims that the original versions of the films no longer exist.  Well, THAT'S a load of bull.  I do not believe it; it's a blatant lie.  Let me ask a simple question:  Um, if the original versions no longer exist, then what version, which master print was used to create all the various other miscellaneous editions that have been shoveled out at us?  Besides, we all know what a hoarder Lucas is - the man throws NOTHING away.  You mean to say that he doesn't have at least ONE servicable print of each original version stored away somewhere?  Come on, already...!  It's been claimed the prints do not exist, that they were destroyed or in such horrendous shape that they were beyond repair.  I'm sorry, I don't buy it.    Furthermore, what's the allure for those of us of the first, original generation of STAR WARS fans to buy these films?  We've already allowed ourselves to be duped into buying multiple versions of them on vhs and dvd.  Sure, the blu-rays will look and sound phenomenal - of that, I have no doubt.  But y'know what?  The dvd's are just as nice.  And besides, in at least one of the dvd releases he included as a contemptuous, condescending concession the original theatrical versions in the form of inferior transfers from the laserdiscs.  Considering that's as close as we'll ever get to getting the original, true versions of the movies on disc, I'll take it.    The only other thing the man could possibly offer as an incentive to purchase this set is to include all the goodies that we as fans have been clamoring for for many years:  deleted/restored scenes from the Original Trilogy; bloopers; the original screentest tapes; audio commentary by Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford(yeah, good luck on getting him to do it, I know), Carrie Fisher, Anthony Daniels, Billy Dee Williams, David Prowse, Frank Oz, etc.; The Holiday Special (yup, why not?); original trailers; and those wonderful nostalgic original \\"making of...\\" documentaries - \\"The Making of Star Wars\\", \\"Special Effects - The Empire Strikes Back\\", \\"Classic Creatures - Return of the Jedi\\", and the compilation \\"Star Wars to Jedi - The Making of a Trilogy\\".  ALL of that is material that we all damned well know Lucas has, and has been sitting on, for years.  The only reason he did not include any of it with previous home video releases has been simple:  He was holding out on us to include them in future releases so that we'd buy the films yet AGAIN.  Period.    Oh, and any special features (such as those treasured and much-sought-after deleted scenes, like the one depicting Luke completing his lightsaber at the beginning of ROTJ) will ONLY be included in the mega-set with all six films - NOT the individual trilogy sets.  So, if you want that extra material, you've gotta buy the set wtih the crappy, embarrassing, insulting Prequels.      Well, I'm done.  I will NOT give this man one more dime.  Since the age of 7, I (and my parents) have done more than my share to make Lucas rich beyond the dreams of avarice.  And the way he repays this?  To keep us strung out, promising what we desperately want but only giving us just enough to ensure we come back for more - like a drug dealer with a bunch of junkies.  Well, no more.  I'll find and buy the disc with the extra materials on eBay or ioffer.com, or a CD Warehouse or Exchange store.  I'd rather give my hard-earned cash to another fan than give Lucas more money.    Here's my closing salvo:  When E.T. was set to be released on dvd, there were to be 2 different sets:  A tin box set crammed with extras, and another more economica set that didn't have quite as many bells and whistles.  I had pre-ordered the second (economical) set.  THEN it was revealed that the ONLY set which would include the original theatrical version of E.T. (the one I grew up with and loved all my life) was the prohibitively expensive tin box set.  Well, there was a FLOOD of outraged protest and cancelled orders (inlcuding my own).  I did not want the reviled, cgi-riddled, dumbed-down version of the film.  At the last second, Spielberg wised up, heard the fans, actually LISTENED to them, and included the original theatrical version with the economical set.      Guess what?  I happily bought that set.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I started this work out series 7 days ago and have also been following her diet plan.  I've lost weight, can already feel a difference in my belly, and feel good!    Level one is hard at first, but after doing it a few days, it is easier!      I highly recommend this video for anyone serious about losing 5-20 pounds.  It does require hand weights (I use 5lb, but would prefer 3 lbs for some of the exercises - would be great to have 3, 5, and 8lb weights!!)      I also own her Making the Cut book.  It is great, as long as you have some history in working out in a gym with weights.  The excercises would have been confusing for me otherwise.  The diet was tough for me, but I think it is better now that I am more committed to it.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|absolutely no sophmore slump here.  in fact this may be the best 2nd album ever!  adele has quickly become one of my all time fav singers...and this cd does not disappoint.  i love the whole cd...but the standouts for me are don't you remember, someone like you & the cover of the cure's lovesong.  her recent appearances on letterman & ellen...and a slew of other appearances in england...only show how incredibly talented adele is.
B003UESJFG|5.0|I really like this movie (watched it in the theater) and I will probably buy it.  But I wanted to point out that several people are giving this a 1 star rating apparently because they \\"feel\\" the original came out in 3D and the DVD should also come out in 3D.  Let me point out that the original came out in BOTH 3D and regular versions, and the first time I watched it, I did not see the 3D version. Sure if you want to wait for a 3D version go ahead, but it's not right for a lot of people to presume that a DVD is a specific format then give it a low rating for being something else.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the best book in the world!!!!! When my friend started reading I thiught that she was crazy. I'm addicted to this series and I could not put it down for a second.
B003WTE886|1.0|I ordered this CD for my dght, along with several other items at the same time.  Everything else came with in a week but this CD never arrived.  I wrote a quick note to the supposed sender and they never got back to me. I am sure we would have loved the CD if only we ever received it.
B003O85W3A|5.0|Arcade Fire has been on my turntable nonstop since I first caught them by chance on one of the late-night chat shows (or maybe it was on Saturday Night Live -- the memory ain't what it used to be).  Here was an exciting band that wasn't from the 1960s or 1970s.  Here was a band that didn't appeal just to 13 year-old girls.  Well, certainly they'll never achieve widespread national and international attention.  But that's okay -- a great band is a great band.    Imagine my surprise when Arcade Fire -- the admitted dark horse -- rode away with Grammy gold!  I only wish it was me handed them their award.  Well done, lads and lasses!    --- Andru Reeve
0307266303|5.0|I just finished this book in two days. It was amazing...funny, heartfelt, informative and motivational all in one.  As soon as I started I found that I could not put it down. The minute I got done reading I went online and shipped a copy both my mom and my sister. I heartily reccomend it to anyone, runners and non-runners alike.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I was floored this morning when I opened my email to see \\"Star Wars\\" Blu-ray in the same sentence.  Then I came here, and well, saw mostly 1 star reviews and knew something was awry. I haven't heard many good things about George Lucas in a long time.  I cannot totally judge the outcome until I see it myself.  Although I absolutely agree he should release a original version of at least the original 2, V and VI or whatever.  Why didn't he release them in the right order in the first place?  Wait, scratch that.  It's a good thing because jar jar blabber a lot really ruined it for me.  C3po was kind of like that, but the rest of it was way too awesome.  So he might of ruined them by the time he got around to making the V and VI. I don't know why he has to have the babbling idiot in every movie?  Maybe that should tell us something?<br /><br />Yes he was a visionary. This is why the first 2 movies were such a breakthrough at the time. I can't think of anyone else that totally blows off the fan base and does whatever they want. Me thinks he arrogant.<br /><br />Long story short, I will watch them and most likely never buy them.
B000YRY8BG|5.0|Excellent!  BBC is always great, and this is no exception.  Fast paced and interesting to watch.  Enjoyed every minute!  Highly recommend.  Bill Nighy (as usual!) is great, as are the other cast members.
B0025KVLRO|5.0|My 12-year-old has recently decided that he likes the Beatles, so we're starting to build his collection over birthdays, Christmas and other celebrations. He loves it.
0670022411|4.0|Enjoyed this book very much.  It doesn't stall out like many of these types.  Eagerly awaiting the next in the series.
0060936223|5.0|Patti speaks with a clear, rare honesty and poetry and movingly celebrates and honors her friend and friendship with Robert.
0061998494|5.0|If you like Craig's stand-up or his show, you will like this book. It was witty, honest, revealing, and surprisingly cerebral. I started out envisioning him saying every word in the book in his adorable accent. Somewhere along the way, it stopped being a book about my favorite late-night host and instead became --- simply --- a great book. I would recommend it to anyone. I'd start peddling it on the street, but it's too cold in Minnesota in February to do that. Buy it!
B00428LIXO|2.0|very gooood! thanks muy bueno. vino en excelentes condiciones, en realidad fue muy buena compra, me gusto mucho aunque no tiene casi funciones divertidas para el bebe. gracias
0375842209|5.0|I had such a hard time putting this book down each night and only did so because I knew I'd never be able to wake up in time for work the next day.  This book drew me in right away with Liesel's plight and the interesting narrator, Death. Loved the descriptions and the characters.  I teared up at the end and almost didn't want to finish the book because then it would be...over. It's one of the best books I've read in a while. I don't remember how I came across this title but I'm glad I did.
6301792734|5.0|I totally agree with everybody's reviews because Gorge Lucas has gone too far with the special effects and of course the infamous scene were Han Solo shoots the green like alien as they say they changed the line I'll need to look up that scene on the DVD version first and then the tape version to see how much different it is then I'll write a review on that as well and the other thing that Star Wars fans are probably as mad about George Lucas is as I just mentioned at the beginning of my review is that the DVD versions has gone to far with too many enhanced special effects and of course if I'm correct a lot of the scenes from the DVD versions were probably taken from the 1997 special edition VHS version if you know what I'm talking about? If not search up Star Wars Special Edition on YouTube or Google and you'll find out what I'm talking about. Also people try to support as many original version as possible but before you pick it up make sure it's genuine like these VHS versions your looking at. So be careful before you purchase that movie or you may fall for a scam we don't want that do we? I knew you would have to agree with my comment so be cautious you've been warned!
0375507256|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a long time.  The writing is assured, at times astonishingly fine; the story is entertaining and engaging; and the structure by which the connections appear as the story unfolds completely satisfying.  I have read many many books over the years, and place this one in the very first rank. Literate, unpretentious, full of life and intelligence, it reminds you what a artistic pleasure a great book can be.
B001N11EMI|1.0|I was sent a bootleg copy of this DVD. If I would have known that it was a bootleg I would not have ordered it. Very disappointed, poor quality.
B0037QGS0K|4.0|I knew this was a chick flick going in but I was surprised at what I got! What I was most impressed with was Amanda Seyfried. She's done a number of \\"chick flicks\\" lately but this one had a bite to it. Amanda's wilingness to show all of her glory was surprising. I never thought she'd go there.<br /><br />The ending had a nice twist to it but I think it could've been a bit stronger. Other than that this would make for a good date movie for a guy trying to get some!...
B0042816YK|1.0|Waste of time, I knew I did not want to see this movie and I am glad I waited for the video so at least I did not waste my $$ too.  Never had the desire to read this book, I think the Author is selfish and needs to get over her self. I hope her ex found a better women to be with one who doesn't leave because she is hungry for pasta!!    Boring movie, really disappointed.
B0041KKYEW|5.0|Clearly some people dont know a great movie/performance when they're sitting there watching one! I guess you can always find someone who hates everything.<br /><br />Natalie Portman was nothing less than spectacular. The thing I like to see from actors is their ability to demonstrate the full gamut of human emotion. Sometimes it takes a few movies or shows to get that but a good roll, coupled with a great actor or actress, can bring a lady from being a pretty good co-star to a must have leading actress. Natalie Portman has seriously stepped up with this fantastic movie.<br /><br />The last time I saw this kind of \\"tour de force\\", of acting was from Dwight Schultz on Star Trek:TNG Season #4 Episode #19. That too was impressive.
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|She if one of the most gifted voices in the music scene today. Her voice is versatile and she never over sings a song. My personal favorite is \\"Rumor has it\\" but the entire album is amazing. One of the best albums that has came out so far this year.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I was introduced to Sanderson when he took on the job of finishing the Wheel of Time series.  I thought he did an excellent job with the first one but was disappointed with the second.  I decided after some debate to go ahead and give this new series a chance despite my disappointment, and I am so glad that I did.  The book is simply amazing!        This book largely sets the stage for what is to come and we are introduced to more characters than the novel actually focuses on so don't be surprised when a few of them show up once and aren't seen again.  The world building is highly original and vivid. The main characters are very well written and very likable.        There are some editing problems in the book as mentioned in other places, but they didn't really bother me. If you are very anal about that sort of thing then be warned in advance. My only real regret with this book is that I read it so soon after being released that I may have to wait awhile for the next installment.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Adele's second studio album has arrived with a force! Adele Adkins is a young singer-songwriter (22 now, but wrote songs for this album while 21) from England. In this sophomore outing, she enlists the help of respected producers like Rick Rubin (Dixie Chicks, Red Hot Chili Peppers) and Ryan Tedder, among others.  I've been listening to songs from this album for the past 3 weeks, and I truly love it. The words \\"Easy Listening\\" come to mind, not  because it identifies the album's musical genre; but because the songs in it are so approachable, so easy to enjoy while doing whatever. Musical instruments are kept to a minimum in most tracks, with a piano, an acoustic guitar or set of drums providing some of the musical setting. But really, the center instrument here is Adele's voice (no complaints here). My favorite songs in the album are \\"Rolling in the Deep\\", \\"Someone Like You\\" (next promotional single) and \\"Don't You Remember\\". While I truly enjoy this album, I don't think this is a stellar or perfect album. Unfair as it might be to point this out, Adele is still developing as an artist. While everything here sounds great, one might also be left with the feeling that she's barely scratching the surface of her talent. Still a truly enjoyable surface!
B003OML23K|5.0|America has fallen and in its wake stands the oppressive country of Panam. 12 districts are inslaved to the mighty capital. The people of the districts work until exhaustion. Then there is the Hunger Games. Once a year, a boy and girl from each district are chosen to fight to the death in a dangerous arena.   Katniss is a sixteen year old girl who has grown up to quickly. When her father dies in a mining accident, her mother drops into a deep depression. The survival of the family then falls on Katniss's shoulders, who is at the time only 12. Though she is strong and learns to hunt. Miraculously, she saves her mother and sister from starving to death, but soon she sees that its not enough. When the people gather for the annual hunger games four years later, it's Katniss's little sister Prim who is chosen to fight. In one last effort to save Prim's life, Katniss volunteers to go in her place.      After years of hunting, Katniss knows how to kill, but can she take another human life as easily as she does an animal's? In the games, is there really a difference?      The Hunger Games will have you on the edge of your seat. I was sure as I was reading that a rebellion would break out. That something would save Katniss from participating in the games, but nothing does. You will not be able to put it down. Its a masterpiece that will make you think. At least, The Hunger Games made me wonder where exactly is our society headed. What our choices today will bring for our future. Also, it reminded me of how blessed I am. I know that after reading this book, I won't be taking anything for granted.     Read The Hunger games. It's amazing, addicting, and eye opening for those of us who have forgotten how well we live in modern society today.
B003R0LBVW|2.0|I got this book based on the fact that it was on the New York Times Bestseller list, and because it was one of Oprah's Book Club books.  The first 1/3 of the book was interesting...but I definitely lost interest after that.  I found myself skipping paragraphs...and then pages just to get through the book and realized...what was the point in even reading the book if I was going to skip parts of it?  I did eventually finish the book just to see what happened to the main charachter in the end...but I would NOT recommend this book at all!
0439023513|5.0|This is Suzanne Collins at her best. This book will consume your life so I warn you to read it only when you have boat loads of free time. You will not want to put it down. MockingJay will make you laugh and then rip your heart out. How pathetic is it that I actually cried at the end? That aside, MockingJay is one of the few books out there that I can truly call a masterpiece.      Katniss is a strong female character, which tends to be rare in our society. You will root for her as she fights against the capital and for those she loves. The unpredictability of this book made it so much better. At certain points I thought I knew exactly where Collins was going, only to be blindsided with a knew twist. Epic is the only way to describe this wonderful ending to an addictive series. It is amazing, but you'll want to keep the kleenex close at hand.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This was a great book.  It was written so well.  Reading it from a 5 year olds point of view was quite interesting.  I enjoyed reading the book!
B002FOX56K|3.0|This movie has a very interesting and somewhat terrifing tale, and is said to be true!    Basically, its about a water company poisoning people for years and not caring about it.    Julia Roberts was very pretty in this movie, however, she does drop the \\"F- bomb\\" ALOT!    I doubt if the lady in real life acted as bitchy, but who knows?    A good story, an eye opener for those who blindly trust companies.
B003R4ZMO0|5.0|I enjoy watching this show. Week after week i am blown away from the excitement and the action that the show has to offer. The cast are all great, and the setting is wonderful in beautiful Hawaii! Just an outstanding show to watch every week. I am looking forward for more exciting episodes and seasons to come! I love Hawaii 5-0. This show and The Walking Dead For the win!
B003UESJDI|5.0|The sleepy English village of Ewedown becomes quite lively when former ugly duckling Tamara Drewe comes back to town.  Now sporting a perky new nose and sexy Daisy Dukes, Tamara quickly becomes romantically involved with a rock star, a sleezy older man, and her childhood sweetheart.  With a large cast and many subplots, this  story of what really goes on behind the quaint postcard-pretty closed doors is full of laughs and tender moments and even some cattle stampedes.<br /><br />This movie is completely charming.  The characters are all believable, the setting is idyllic, and the script is clever and quirky.  All of the adult shenanigans are witnessed - and complicated - by a pair of adolescent girls, a kind of comical Greek chorus who tie it all together.  If you like good, indie British films, you'll love this one.
B0011ZNAIC|3.0|So first of all, let me say that I am a huge fan of Disney Pixar. This movie is made by DreamWorks, so I may be a little biased against it. However, I'll try to be as objective as possible. This movie is once again another takeoff of a Pixar movie (A Bug's Life). I will delve into some different aspects of the film here:<br /><br />Characters: The basic characters are Barry B. Benson, an adventurous bee, Vanessa, a human florist, and Adam, Barry's best friend. There are also other characters, such as Ken, Vanessa's boyfriend, Barry's parents, and Mooseblood the mosquito. I really felt like the characters were too, I don't know, linear. Like they were just following a poorly written script without any real emotion put into it. I felt like you didn't get to know the any of characters, with a few exceptions. Ken is one of those, and Barry's parents are the other. Ken is really full of himself, and he loves tennis. He's really built, like, bodybuilder built. He's also really jealous and self conscious, as well as a little bit overprotective. Barry's parents are kind of typical from films. They want their son to do what his dad did, and his mom always fights with her husband. Those three I felt like you could actually know. One of the things I like about Pixar is that they always make memorable characters. It feels like you could actually know this guy. For example, in UP I could just imagine that Carl is the typical eccentric old man down the street. And there are more characters with a prominent role. In Bee Movie, there are basically three main characters that do most of the speaking, whereas in all the Pixar movies (with the exception of WALL-E) there are a lot more prominent characters.<br /><br />Story: This is where I felt like the idea was there, but it wasn't polished at all. ---SPOILER ALERT--- The basic gist of the movie is that there's Barry, the overactive, restless bee, and he breaks all the bee rules, specifically the one that says no talking to humans. In a crazy course of events, he makes the \\"astonishing\\" discovery that humans are farming bees and taking the honey for themselves. He gets mad about this, and proceeds to sue the human race. He wins the lawsuit, and since the bees have taken all the honey back that humans had, they no longer have to make it, and the pollen no longer gets spread around and all the vegetation dies out. Vanessa manages to convince him of this fact, and informs him that the last living flowers are going to be on display at the tournament of roses. They go, steal the flowers, and bring them back, get the pollen and spread it to all the flowers, and everything lives again. The story really seemed to kind of fail. There really needed to be about an extra fifteen to twenty minutes, because it was going in all different directions and it just needed more time to come together. ---SPOILER END--- The thing that I really didn't like about the dialogue is that most of the time it sounded like a bunch of sixth graders. For example: Dude, that girl was hot! Hey, there some chicks. I bet if they thought we were Pollen Jocks, they'd go out with us. Barry's dating a human! They were making out! etc, etc. There is also one scene were Ken and Vanessa break up, and Barry dreams about Vanessa, and has a pretty intense crush on her. Of course, who wouldn't, as she's got the curves of a supermodel. However, this will go over the heads of the intended audience age range, so it might not be a big deal.<br /><br />Animation: This is the only place where DreamWorks really got it done. The inside of the beehive looks great, the tennis balls the Ken smacks around are the perfect color. And the bees look good as well. However, the \\"virtual wardrobe\\" for all the characters is pathetic. Ken wears the same white shirt the entire movie, and Vanessa only has one or two outfits through out the entire movie. And all the bees wear the same shirt, except for the Pollen Jocks and their sergeant.<br /><br />Voice Acting: this is perhaps the biggest bad spot of this movie. Jerry Seinfeld does Barry, and it's mediocre. Renee Zelleweger does Vanessa, and it's OK for the first five minutes or so, but then the \\"breathiness\\" of her voice really gets annoying. The real standout was Chris Rock as Mooseblood. He did a really good job.<br /><br />Overall, this movie falls short in more ways than one, but kids ages 4-7 will probably enjoy it. A lot of sexual innuendo, more than I've seen in any movie geared towards younger kids. Not a great moral to the story, other than doing the right thing. So I give this movie a three out of five stars. Hope this was helpful....ot of this movie. Jerry Seinfeld does Barry, and it's mediocre.

B0038BBA4I|4.0|This is some good ole laid back folk rock. Bit more rock than folk but that's fine.  The harmonies are lovely, the occasional outburst is welcomed and the lyrics are pleasant.
B00139XTG4|4.0|This is a good book that introduces people to \\"curve jumping\\" however, most of the time curve jumping is discussed in terms of technological breakthroughs and ideas. This book attacks both the good and the bad of the unforeseeable and why we should expect it. It also flies in the face of diversification because it turns market trends on their head.<br /><br />The book gets a little repetitive and while he continues to support his thesis very well I feel that the main theme of the book is covered by the midpoint. A must read for anyone who deals with risk management, financial or otherwise.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|this movie was great my wife and i have the cd sound track too, we listen and watch them all the time.  scott dawson    if you don't have them get them.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|QT is a master of making movies.  But, he's also a master of movie music.  He knows how to find music that best suits the movie and best accentuates what's going on in particular scenes. This has a wide variety of music genres and all of them are excellent!  I love Tarantino's movies and I love the music he chooses. The man is brilliant and this CD is awesome.
B001RCD2DW|5.0|I will make this simple. Buy these headphones. For the price you can find them on here it is mind blowing. They do take awhile to break in and if you like true to life sound then look no further. There are cans that cost upwards to $1400 or more that sound only slightly better than these. I think the people that rate these down are nit picking tightwads. For the price you pay you practically owe AKG more $ for what you get.      I have tested MANY headphones and yes I am picky also but for what you pay it's a no brainer. Buy these now!
B0043GAZYS|1.0|The movie itself is pretty fun, fairly creative, imaginative, and I'd say its a solid 4 for these days.    But lets get to the real reason I'm writing this review.. I gave the \\"movie\\" a 1 star because of its Bluray BD-Live contents.  This disk is what finally made the argument for me to DISABLE BDLive on my bluray player.      BDLive has the ability to be the game-changing technology for the good ... but as the devlopers did with THIS disk, they proved that even without malicious intent, there are things you DONT want from a bluray disk.    1) with BDLive enabled, startup time was extended, why? Because the disk went OUT to the internet, and started streaming content without directly requesting permission to do so.    You might expect an \\"update\\" to be done without request, but movie previews?  MOVIE F**KING PREVIEWS!!???  Again, had I been asked \\"would you like to get current movie previews from the web?\\" I would have had the option to say no.. and be done with it.  Hell previews at all should be POST views.. that is.. **AFTER** the movie has played, so that you're not forced to sit through nor find the latest way the idiots that have made these disks decided to fool you into not skipping through ... ie. menu doesn't work, Skip doesn't work, oh.. fast forward didn't work, but play did work to skip what's already playing.. why didn't *I* think of that first..     2) Selecting to start the movie, you're presented with yet another annoyance Twitter/Facebook logins?  Had there been a \\"Play movie with Logon\\" rather than a \\"Play movie\\" button I would have chosen the \\"Play movie\\" ... its reminiscent of the \\"Voyage of the Mind\\" tricks played by the Monty Python crew oh so long ago in their video game ... ie.. plays a clip from the fake show \\"Voyage of the Mind\\" about \\"Dejavu\\" and when you try to stop it from playing.. they ask if you're really sure.. and no matter what you do, the first time, they always play it again ... and again you have to id that you want it to end..SO TO on this Bluray.. default connections that are not wanted, not asked for permission to do, and then just the over-all irritation factor stoping you from getting TO the actual movie..     hence.. 1 star.. these bluray makers need a VERY strong message sent to them, I'm just hoping that enough people will also feel strongly about the negative use of the bluray featureset, to tell them the same.
B001MEJY8W|3.0|After hearing a lot about how shocking is this movie the thing that shocks me the most are the big number of reviewers giving it 4 and 5 stars. My only explanation is that it comes from impressionable SAW movies fans. This is not the thought provoking gem that a lot of people is making it to be. Lots has been said about the plot or lack there of so I wont go into it. Lets go straight to the point. If you want a movie with extreme torture scene after torture scene then this is the movie for you. This being an horror movie there's nothing wrong with that. If you are looking for a good plot and character development then this is not for you. My biggest problem is that one don't get the chance to care for the characters other than they are innocent women. I give it 3 stars for production value and good acting.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|It's still Not too late!  Include the \\"Special Edition\\" if you must, but First Generation Fans (me) want the Original Star Wars that we remember from 1977.  We want to see Greedo fried before he has a chance to snort.  We want to see imperial chests explode in the control room and the detention block! We don't want Episode 4, we don't want A New Hope...WE WANT STAR WARS! Little things, yes. But it's what your core fans want!  We were the ones who waited in lines in 1977, something that had never been seen before.  WE MADE YOU!    So, please, Mr. Creator.... if you don't mind and if it would not be too much trouble....  GIVE US THE ORIGINAL STAR WARS ALREADY, YOU DARN GREEDY MAN!!!!!

B003QCCS36|5.0|I stumbled across RLM on BBC4 Songwriters' Circle in late 2010. His solo acoustic rendition of \\"Beg Steal or Borrow\\" completely stole the show from David Gray and KT Tunstall, both fine performers themselves. Equally by chance I caught his Southbank Centre concert last week (21/2/11). This man and his band, The Pariah Dogs, are brilliant. I immediately bought all 4 of his albums and haven't had them off the machines since. Whilst each is full of good stuff it is clear that he has absolutely hit his stride with \\"God Willin'..\\" Inevitable comparisons with The Band, CSN, Little Feat etc and the influences are there, but Ray is his own man and the arrangements and lyrics are original and compelling. And that voice...Otis Redding? Joe Cocker? Paul Rodgers? Its just bloody marvelous. If one has to single out stand-outs mine would be the title track, Repo Man, BS or B, For the Summer (with its superb slide break). But in truth there's not a poor song to be found and I don't think its an exaggeration to rate this a classic album. Lets hope there's so much more to come from Ray La Montagne.

B000LXHK2C|4.0|A high profile bond trader from London (Russell Crowe) is caught between his busy life as a trader and life at a chateau/vineyard (filled with childhood memories) in France.  The entire movie is portrayed in a light-hearted way with a good helping of French language (with subtitles, although this does not detract from the movie), culture, music, romance and wine.  Crowe does well as the lead and it makes for a very enjoyable movie.

0670022411|1.0|This is a winner only if you want an illustration of how to try to cash in on as many recently popular themes as you possibly can. The research is handled in a strained fashion and the heroine is singularly lacking in charm. Ms Harkness would do well to read a few good romances to see how it's done.<br /><br />So far there isn't a school for witches, but it sounds like that might be coming in the inevitable sequel and there isn't a feisty young cyber-whiz hunting mysogynistic old Nazis, but I'm sure Ms Harkness is working on that too.

B0041OJ0Y8|4.0|I learned of Die Antwoord in Parade Magazine, of all places, in an interview with Jack Black. He raved about them, so I bought myself a copy of their cd $0$. Growing up in the 60's and 70's, I was always very into music and stayed up on it until my first son was born in 2000. Since then I've been busy with other stuff, but always kept my ears open for something unusual or interesting, and Die Antwoord sounded like both. They are a South African rap group with party, political and PORNOGRAPHIC leanings. I mean all of those things in a good way. They reminded me of the 80's/90's rap group that did \\"Doowhutchalike,\\" kind of goofy, but also a little bit like Digable Planets -- jazzy and melodic. Then you add in their South African accents and slang, filthy mouths and graphic fantasies, and they are just about a perfect mid-life rescue band. Thank you for being so rude. I am just curious what to do when summer comes -- I live in a very small town, and so far have had the windows rolled up in my car when I am blasting Die Antwoord... of course, there's no way I can play it at home around my three young sons...

B002ZG98UK|2.0|I enjoyed the previous Resident Evil movies.  But, this movie seemed to be crafted entirely for the 3D experience, and not so much for advancing the plot.  There is plenty of action, but it's almost all in slow motion to show things coming at the screen.  I don't have a 3D television, so none of this impressed me, and I would have rather seen the action at full speed.    The movie has a terrible plot and dialog.  There are a lot of things that just make you want to yell, \\"B.S.\\".  When Alice is flying into LA and the city has fires all over the place with plumes of smoke everywhere...she notices that there are no signs of life, not even the undead.  Well, who started all the fires then?  Landing a plane on top of a building.  And why did they light so many torches in the prison?  Just how much light do they need?  When did Alice find out how to clone herself?  Where did she find the facilities to do it?  Who's the big guy with the monster Axe and where did he come from?  Shouldn't Umbrella be trying to figure out how to fix the problem or kill all the zombies?  After all, you can't live forever underground.  Sooner or later you'll run out of food and need a safe world to return to.    So many plotholes.  I found it hard to make it through this movie.
0670022411|3.0|This book is very slow and disjointed. It really doesn't pick up until almost half way through the book. It certainly is not worth the $12 i paid for the Kindle version. I won't buy a book for that kind a money again. For saving trees, print, processing etc by using kindle, this book might have been worth $5.00. Publishers and authors are getting greedy. If they are going to charge this much, it should be a great book, not an ok book.
B002BWP4A6|1.0|Watching this film would have been a waste of my time had it not been for the fact that i watched it during a snow storm---little else to do otherwise.I usually enjoy foreign language films but this one dragged on and on.I had no interest in any of the characters,there was no suspense and really there was no point to it all.The ending was like the rest of the movie rather vanilla.
B0030Y11XS|4.0|Wow, Michael Moore must have taken some punches approaching security guards at Bank of America etc.  In this movie Moore:    - looks at why GM has failed compared to German and Japanese rivals,   - tries to understand derivatives,    - flashes back to the Financial Crisis of '08/'09 with footage of senators revolting in Congress about the bailout.      He also shows stirring footage of:  - widows and widowers who had policies taken out against their late spouses by their former employers  - families being evicted from their homes after 4 decades    Wall Street is in charge is the charge and I (sadly) happen to agree.  While I do not agree socialism will work, I do not have an alternative to capitalism.    I look forward to the sequel in a few years Michael...IPOs are on the up, Tech stocks are booming like it's 1999 and valuations are starting to look heady already.  Perhaps then things will be a bit more dire.  Bailout is NOT the solution.  In recessions, one needs to let those whose excesses got the better of them be subjected to the raw forces of supply and demand.

The \\"hot\\" vampire is super into yoga, red wine, and talking about girl troubles with his gay best(daemon) friend? Is he a California vampire? How are you going to describe the male love interest of the book being in a yoga pose where he is practically balancing on his ear with his feet straight up in the air? Goofy!  Overall, the plot/pace of the book is alright. but please no more vampires!!!
B002ZG99TA|5.0|I took my son, who is turning 13 in a few weeks, to see this at the theatre. It was his choice. I hadnt seen the previews but thought that as a train show it couldnt be very good. Boy was i wrong. From the beginning all through to the end the movie grabs ahold of you and doesnt let go. It leaves you on the edge of your seat several times in the movie. I felt myself mad at the people who wouldnt listen to Chris Pine and Denzel Washington. I found myself fearing for the lives of the small towns and When the show had come to an end I found myself happy for the characters. I didnt know this was based on a true story but i would like to shake the hands of the men that were involved in this. What an amazing day they had. I would definately watch this again and again. In fact my son has put this DVD on his wishlist for his birthday.    Sit back, relax and prepare for one heck of a ride!!!!

0553805371|4.0|Stephen Hawking is my hero. He wrote in his first book about his disability and how he worked within it to become a better scientist. \\"The Grand Design\\" tells an epic story of human understanding. I'm not well educated in science or history, and I think few people are aware of just how high the ancient greeks soared in their pursuit of knowledge. They observed that the sun was the center of our solar system, that it was probably an ordinary star, and that matter was made of \\"atoms.\\" This and the later history of physical investigation make for satisfying reading.<br /><br />The biggest message in the book is this: We may know how the universe came to be. Observation and testing indicates it came out of nothing. The authors write, \\"Bodies such as stars or black holes cannot just appear out of nothing, but a whole universe can.\\" They explain how this occurs, but it's rather swift. I got more detail reading the author Victor Stenger on this subject. A universe from nothing sounds completely divorced from normal human experience, but then I remembered birth. Two teenagers can't make an ear or a finger, but they can make a whole person.<br /><br />Oddly, we are in a similar situation to the ancient Greeks. We have answers to big philosophical questions, and we have strong data to support them. We can accept this progress and build on it, or we can turn our brains off and say, \\"Oh, who really knows? It'll remain a mystery.\\" In so doing, we open ourselves to worthless mystical nonsense. The knowledge of Greece was ignored and forgotten for a thousand years, and they weren't called \\"The Dark Ages\\" for nothing.<br /><br />I offer two minor criticisms. The authors lament the use of terms like, \\"physical laws\\" or \\"mathematical laws,\\" because they imply an unseen author and enforcer. Yes, I agree, the word \\"law\\" is misleading. So stop using it! Why not use \\"pattern\\" instead? That's what we're talking about, observed patterns of phenomena that we group in our brains as \\"gravity.\\" Matter simply attracts other matter in predictable ways. There are no \\"laws,\\" only patterns.<br /><br />Secondly, the book harps on the fine-tuned environment that allowed for life and human beings, which is a big point of interest for many people. Much is made of the speculation that life would be impossible if the physical patterns were slightly different. We fail to recognize how small a phenomenon life is. A slightly different universe would remain lifeless, this is true. However, our existing universe is enormously hostile to life. If we imagine a universe devoted to creating life exclusively, it would be quite different from our own. In our universe, life happens on a razor-thin margin, but it happens so seldom, we'll miss the whole drama if we focus too much on it. Life is not the main act in our universe. We are not the main act. We are important to ourselves and each other, but not to the cosmos.s other matter in predictable ways. There are no \\"laws,\\" only patterns.

B003DZX3SA|5.0|I previously owned this movie in VHS format when my children were young, but it obviously did not survive long enough for my grandchildren to enjoy! My granddaughter played the VHS so frequently that it soon bit the dust. We were sadly without this classic until Disney opened the vaults and created the new diamond edition. My grandchildren are now happily enjoying this classic, and I am rediscovering the magic all over again!
B004EPYZOO|4.0|Writer Todd Farmer and director Patrick Lussier really seemed to make the most of their partnership once they started working together. On their own, they brought us films like Jason X, Dracula 2000 and its sequels, and White Noise 2. Other than Jason X getting a pass from loyal horror and Friday the 13th fans, you don't really hear much about those other films. Drive Angry is technically only the second time Farmer and Lussier have collaborated with one another, but their first outing together was My Bloody Valentine which was actually a hell of a lot of fun. Not to mention the two horror buffs are currently attached to two projects that seem to have been in the works for ages; Halloween III and the Hellraiser reboot. So how would Drive Angry measure up to My Bloody Valentine? Would it be just as fun and would the 3D be utilized properly? How terrible would Nicolas Cage be? Turns out that if you're a fan of the previous work Farmer and Lussier have become associated with, you have nothing to worry about with Drive Angry.<br /><br />How is it that every character in the main cast is a total badass? It's because of that that it's hard to dislike anyone in the film including Nicolas Cage. Cage seems a little dull at first. When he mutters the line, \\"Tell him...I'm comin'!\\" it sounds a bit stiff and it isn't clear what type of performance Cage is going to give. Milton is actually Cage's most entertaining role since Big Daddy. He makes it seem so natural to be so angry while also being this unstoppable vigilante that just broke out of hell. Amber Heard's Piper comes off like she has a bigger pair of balls than any man she comes in contact with. She isn't afraid to go toe-to-toe with anyone and she usually comes out on top. William Fichtner may be the most entertaining part of the cast. He's been sent by the big man downstairs to retrieve Milton and bring him back to hell. His quick wit combined with the tricks he pulls off with that coin he carries around and his practically endless arsenal of superhuman abilities cause all eyes to be glued to him whenever he walks on screen. Then there's Billy Burke whose Jonah King character is a satanic cult leader convinced that he can't be harmed by anything from this earth. Jonah is such a despicable character that you're practically rooting for his character to bite it by the time his wicked plan is about to come to fruition.<br /><br />In addition to the film's cast, the writing is fairly entertaining as well. If you're familiar with anything Farmer or Lussier have done, you can pretty much expect events in the film to get a little outrageous or extremely outlandish at times. To tell the truth, that's half the charm of their films and what makes them so much fun. Does anyone else remember how people were saying that films like Crank or The Expendables were just kind of fun action films that you didn't have to think hard about? While that statement failed to register with me about those two films since I disliked both immensely, it fits extremely well with films by Farmer and Lussier except their films have a little more of a horror twist to them. The dialogue stood out at times, as well. There's a line Jonah spits out to Piper that went something like, \\"I could shoot you in the throat right now and watch you gurgle while I eat my morning grapefruit...\\" Some may consider that terrible, but the way Burke says it and the context it resides in really hit home with me. Cage also delivers a rather standout speech about how he had to watch his daughter suffer in hell while staring into a barrel of fire that is pretty memorable.<br /><br />The humor in the film slides into the storyline fairly smoothly. Everything from sarcastic one-liners to a rather obese man taking a picture of a naked woman lying on the sidewalk with his cell phone will be sure to get a fair amount of laughs. The coffee scene with Nicolas Cage is just really hilarious. All of that over black coffee and sugar. Todd Farmer's Frank may get the most laughs and audience reaction though, especially once Fichtner's The Accountant shows up. Drive Angry is just able to effectively blend action, comedy, and horror into this exceptionally entertaining film that engrosses your attention from beginning to end.<br /><br />Drive Angry is just ridiculous fun. It has an incredibly solid cast, an excessive amount of explosions and high octane car chases, and there's enough blood and T&A to satisfy the most deprived R-rated film enthusiasts. The 3D deserves to be mentioned, as well. Having shotgun shells, severed limbs, various amounts of debris, and a countless amount of bullets practically fall into your lap should be a good enough reason to see this film in theaters. Drive Angry actually being an extremely satisfying and extraordinary action film is just a bonus.hs and audience reaction though, especially once Fichtner's The Accountant shows up.

B003EY7IRC|4.0|I have read many paranormal romances series in the last year.  This one definitely took the top series on my list, with Black Dagger Brotherhood falling into second place.  The fever series has a great super natural story line.  The story line alone kept me wanting to come back for more.  There were beautiful twists.  I was lucky because I didn't read the series until all the books complete.  So I really can't say much about the cliffhangers, except that in book 5, I would have been really upset to have to wait to figure out what happens in book 6.  Part of me enjoys the idea of having to wait until book 6 to find out what Mac and Barrons are.  However, I still don't think anything was really clarified.  I am an engineer and I like direct answers.  Some of you might enjoy figuring it all out on your own, but I want something a little more definitive.   I also wish there was a bit more erotica.  I too enjoy a little tease and don't need everything spelled out for me, but I feel I had to wait too long for something that didn't really happen.  I enjoyed the descriptions of the Unseelie, no matter how disgusting they were.  That fact alone would make this series a great movie.  In book 6, the passion between Mac and Barrons didn't really do it for me.  I think Mac was a great character, a little vapid at times, but overall she stuck to her guns most of the series.  Barrons I felt needed a bit more personality (not happy go lucky, just more descriptive).  I realize the author didn't say this was a romance.  She says urban fantasy, which I agree with.  I really am not a huge fan of die-hard lay in bed all day romance.  I am more of a get to the point kind of gal.  This series was CLOSE to what I wanted, but still not completely there.    The series went from something new and thrilling to something confused and slightly repetitive.  However, I still rate it up there pretty high because Karen kept us in interesting places along the way.  The imaginative settings would alsomake a great movie.  It's a little bit Matrix with an adult Labryinth (Jennifer Connely), a little Twilight with a touch of adult Harry Potter/Percy Jackson and maybe even a bit of Silent Hill.  From the Dark Zone to the Silvers.  From the White Mansion to the Kings boudoir.  From the Fae lands to the earth beaches.  It was quiet a ride.  If I could find something like that with a bit more spice between the two main characters...that would the the top for me.
B000UD08HW|2.0|Buyer beware of blu-ray version!!    I'm a huge fan of David Gilmour, and certain segments of this concert could've been incredible. Unfortunately, I just could not get passed the highly distorted look of most camera shots on this blue ray. They put super low-resolution onto a blu-ray, and it just doesn't work. I'd rather watch low-definition cable on my television than this blu-ray. Trying to sit through it actually gave me a head ache (that isn't an exaggeration). The other thing is that the audio seems to really favor the mid-range, which just doesn't sound quite right and gets annoying. I get better audio quality through my digital cable concert channel. Everything about David Gilmour and Pink Floyd has been perfection to me... up until this blu-ray. I really feel like I got cheated out of my 30 bucks. I suggest you pick a different Gilmour concert with decent video and audio!!    I wanted so badly to enjoy this blu-ray that I ignored some other reviews saying the same thing as me. Big mistake!!!
1423101502|3.0|The last book of any series is never my favorite. It's always too much battle, not enough plot. This book at least had somewhat of a plot. However, there were a few problems.<br /><br />Spoilers ahead<br /><br />*Rachel's clairvoyance was discovered a little to late. It was almost like Riordan just kind of threw that in there. Granted, Rachel was only in two books (you can't really count the third book; she was in it for about one page), but maybe if she started having these visions when she first appeared in the series, it wouldn't have felt as forced.<br /><br />*Too much deus ex machina. The fact that Percy is not invincible is just a little too convenient. Of course, the only time he's almost stabbed in his vulnerable spot, Annabeth jumps in front of the knife.<br /><br />*Demeter and Persephone in this story were a little ridiculous. They weren't a major part of the novel, but it just bugged me. They had very lame comments and Demeter was constantly complaining about stuff. I don't know if their comments were supposed to be funny, but I didn't think so.<br /><br />Okay, enough with the negatives. Now for the positives.<br /><br />*The deaths. Now in some books, the deaths are pointless. If they don't do anything for the plot, did they even need to die? The major deaths in this book were handled perfectly. Silena's death was done to sort of redeem herself, and Luke died to save everyone. T<br /><br />*Looking more into Luke and Annabeth and Thalia's backstory. That was interesting.<br /><br />*Overall, I think it was a good finish. If you like the rest of the PJ series you'll like this one.
B002JWD6AS|4.0|I think it's a lovely book, I enjoyed from the beginning 'till the end. But sometimes it just looked like something was going to happen, something major in the couple's romance but it didn't and I've got a little frustrated...  But it's a good book, a good romance. And I liked to see two points of view, Grace's and Sam's.
B0017K8X5Q|5.0|I ordered this fan for my parents compaq PC as there was no case fan,just a CPU fan.This was the only fan that would fit in the opening provided and there aren't alot of 100mm fans out there.The 12mm profile of the fan saves alot of space.This fan came in three days with free shipping and works perfectly. It is also very quiet which they like.I use it to pull cooler air into the case and have noticed cooler CPU temps using The Speed Fan program.Also the packing was very cool.
B0019X3ZZY|2.0|I've seen pointless plots in my day but this one takes the cake. I can see how this was very offensive and pushing the boundaries in 1975, but to me all this over the top debauchery is laughable. From the feces eating, to getting urinated on, I just can't take it serious. I would just love to been their when this film was thought up, \\"Hey, let's make a film about a bunch of kidnapped kids being subjected to feces eating and other sexual depravity. Then we will torture and kill them in the end. Maybe if we are sick enough, my film will get me noticed\\" - Director Pier Paolo Pasolini. Not only was I bored to tears, the same thing happens over and over. At the films end I wasn't shocked or even that grossed out, I just felt dirty. Almost like I just had been felt up by some old perverted homosexual guys (which the film is full of). Heck, I couldn't even kiss my gf after watching this. Every time I tried I pictured some old dude groping some kid. Watching this was exhausting. It's non-stop gross out tactics.
0385342047|4.0|After the first few chapters, I was sure I wasn't going to give a great review but, as I should have known, Sophie Kinsella managed to charm me with her flawed yet loveable characters and I couldn't put it down. There is no doubt, Kinsella is the funniest author in the genre, closely followed by Marian Keyes (maybe it's a European thing). Although I was seriously bored with the shopaholic theme and whispering \\"enough already!\\" to myself, I was also chuckling throughout the entire book. I especially enjoyed the twist with Elinor and thought Minnie's affection toward her was adorable. I do think Kinsella should quit while she's \\"sort of\\" ahead. Her stand-alone books are so great, she can stop beating a dead horse.

B003XT8Y3A|5.0|Janine Jansen is one of the top violinists in a time when we are blessed with a large number of truly fine young musicians.  She has beauty of presence both as soloist with orchestra and as a recitalist, a secure technique, and one of the creamiest<br />sounds to some from anyone's violin.  This recital BEAU SOIR is all of a mood - that dream time, the gloaming so well define by the French school. This is music for the romantic ear and it is completely satisfying on every level. Her impressive collaborator is Itamar Golan at the piano.<br /><br />The recital opens with Claude Debussy (1862-1918) Sonata for Violin and Piano in G minor - eloquent! - and encored by Debussy's 'Beau Soir' and 'Clair de lune' (both in transcriptions for the violin and piano).  Jansen then wisely updates the repertoire with some new works by contemporary Swiss composer Richard Dubugnon - 'La Minute exquise', 'Hypnos' (written for Jansen and this particular album) and 'Retour &agrave; Montfort-l'Amaury' (also written for this recital).  If all of this composer's music is as appealing and immediately accessible as these works then he as a very promising future.<br /><br />It s always a pleasure to encounter another work by the gifted Lili Boulanger (1893-1918) and here it is a beautiful 'Nocturne'. And again as a well timed change of pace Jansen offers from Olivier Messiaen (1908-1992) his 'Th&egrave;me et Variations pour violin et piano', a work of utter tranquility but with technical demands for both violin and piano.  'Apr&egrave;s un rêve' by Gabriel  Faur&eacute; (1845- 1924) follows, a perfect reverie.  In the other major piece for this recording Jansen and Golan is the 'Sonata for Violin and Piano in G major' by  Maurice Ravel (1875-1937), the inclusion of which makes this a very well rounded survey of French music for the violin and piano.<br /><br />But in addition to the brilliance of the performances is the mood this gentle recital creates - music for a sensuous night.  There is a taste of many delicacies here!  Grady Harp, February 11ruary 11
1599218011|2.0|I love the energy of this book and I love the author's story and I really really wanted to embrace it. But I have concerns. My first big issue is w/ cleanses -- sorry, just have never believed in those. But that is a very very personal thing, though, and I figured I could just skip that -- to each her own. But then I noticed the suggested veggie/vegan lifestyle leans heavily on soy products and tree nuts, things to which I am either flatout allergic or highly intolerant and lots and lots and lots of other people are too. Plus, as a vegan lifestyle, she completely eliminates fatfree yogurt -- you can get humane, organic yogurts and they are full of the super probiotics she suggests so why ban them? Finally, I just don't get the importance/need for juicing. I'll have to reread that part, maybe she explains and I missed it. I guess if you are wanting to ingest green stuff, juicing might be the most palatable way to get it down. Hmmmmm. Well, I am planning to reread her book because my body is sending big signals that it needs some major lifestyle shifts although its pretty clean already. Certainly this plan has worked for Kris. So maybe her biggest message is to make your health a priority and then discover the different tools/resources you need to maintain that, whatever it takes -- I can live w/ that!
0671449028|5.0|Since we had our son 9 months ago, we have read a variety of children board books. Sandra Boynton is one of the most creative and fun authors for the 0-2 age groups. Everyone of her books has hilarious illustrations and the stories are simple, engaging and enjoyable by all.
B003EY7IRC|2.0|First let me start by saying that the Highlander series is my all-time favorite, and I thought Karen Marie Moning just hung the moon with every book she wrote.  That was until the she produced the Fever series.    I really haven't enjoyed this series at all, and I feel that each new book is worse than those that preceeded it.  I have no idea where that wonderful writer went that I enjoyed so much, she certainly wasn't evident in this series.    Some of my primary gripes:    -MacKayla's habit of constant whining    -Repetition seems to be a hallmark of this series.  If it's not Mac constantly talking to herself about the same old things over and over, then it's other characters or situations rehashing, re-enacting or simply repeating past thoughts/events/etc.  It felt as if Ms Moning couldn't come up with enough material to keep things flowing, and so resorted to this as \\"filler\\" to make the needed page count for each book.     -I know that this series was not written to showcase the Keltars, but when they were mentioned I felt let down at how their characters were portrayed.  In the Highlander books the Keltars were honorable, solid, intelligent, and so much more.  In the Fever series it seemed that they became very much less, as though Moning were building the Fever characters at the expense of those she introduced in the previous series.  To have built the Keltars up so well previously and then to make them seem so...small, it really didn't sit well.    -While I did appreciate that some answers were finally given in this last book I am not happy about all the questions that STILL are NOT answered.  What is Barrons?  Why is he the way he is?  What happens with Dani?  Christopher?    Ms. Moning seems to hint that there may be more books to come in this series. Will I read them if there are?  No.  I have had more than enough of this Fever, and am glad to finally be over it.      Should she return to the magical, wonderful and entrancing style of writing that she began with I would be quite happy to pay $20+ per book and to leave five star reviews.  However, I have to say that after this last series I will be extremely hesitant to trust that what she writes in future will be something that I would find to be worth the effort and expense.  If the samples don't weave that same magic for me, then I will simply pass from now on.
1601251505|5.0|As an avid fan of D&D 3.5, I learned relatively late about Paizo and the Pathfinder system (regrettably, late enough that I had already dropped hundreds to replace my 3.0 material with 3.5 books). Upon learning of Pathfinder, and what Paizo has been doing with the 3.5 system abandoned by WoTC in favor of 4e, I was eager to have a look. I initially purchased the core rulebook in PDF format directly from Paizo, and quickly found myself ensnared by the improvements. I ordered the hard copy and immediately got busy converting my campaign. My players are extremely pleased with the system and genuinely feel like new life has been breathed into their characters.<br /><br />If you are familiar with D&D 3.0/3.5, and especially if you are not satisfied with the direction D&D is headed in 4e, then Pathfinder is for you. I strongly recommend this product - players and GMs alike will not be disappointed.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I wish you could give half stars, I rarely give anything top rating because nothing is perfect.  Overall I would technically give this 4.5 stars.  I rarely enjoy workout videos because I prefer to hit the gym and go \\"old school\\" lifting my heavy weights and using the elliptical and/or treadmill.  However, sometimes life gets in the way and I'm have begun to feel the need for something that could give me a quick workout and I think I found that with this video.  I just completed the first series and while some of my friends warned me I would be pushed to my limits I would say it was just right.  I was able to complete all sets while feeling the \\"pain\\".  I knew the abs section would be the hardest because even though I work out regularly I neglect my abs.  I generally get neck strain even when doing abs on a stability ball, however, Jillian's 1 minut ab workout which is done three times (total 3 minutes) my neck never felt strained. I also like how she includes the strength training along with the cardio.  I owe a large portion of my 50lb+ weight loss to my weight regimine.  I admit I lift a lot heavier weights at the gym then I did going through this video but the strength training in Jillian's video is more for endurance.<br /><br />Before buying this video I read through reviews here and I always read those who give the item 1 star.  I wanted to touch base regarding some of the people's issues with the video to hopefully help others who are on the fence like I was.  Some people mentioned that no one should do this video everyday because when lifting weights you shouldn't work out the same muscle group two days in a row.  While this is true that theory is only valid when someone is lifting heavy weights and fully working the muscle groups.  For example, when I'm at the gym I will work my triceps three different ways using a weight machine, doing dips, and using a dumbbell.  I also will lift 15lb bicep curls, 90lbs on the chest press machine or 45lbs on dumbbell chest press, 150lbs on leg press, and 25lbs dumbbell reverse rows.  At that level I wouldn't want to go in the next day and rework the same muscles they need time to heal and recover.  However, I can easily see myself doing this video everyday because 20 minutes (technically 9 minute) of strength training isn't going to overwork my muscles.  Now people who are really out of shape should take it easy because they will more than likely be sore etc but keep in mind you don't HAVE to use the weight every single day.  Just going through the motions and using your own strength to do the bicep curls, the rows, or other strength training exercises you are still getting a workout.  Do weights one day and the next day do the video but focus on the cardio.  As long as you are eating healthy you should still see some results.<br /><br />The other issue people have complained about is regarding their knees hurting.  I have a lot of knee problems from 16 years of ballet dancing.  My knees crackle making a sound like walking on broken glass and I occassionally have problems walking up stairs etc.  However, there is nothing abnormal about any of the exercises done in this video.  If you properly (ie knees never going over your toes) execute the exercises there shouldn't be any injuries or problems.<br /><br />Overall I recommend this video for people who are wanting something to add to their regular workout regime.  My only issue is I question the validity of the claim that you can lose up to 20lbs with this video.  20 minutes a day isn't enough to help people who overeat their diet lose weight.  If you want to lose the weight you still have to eat healthy and that means limiting your caloric intake (not fat or carbohydrate intake you need both fat and carbs in a healthy diet).  My friend and I both lost 50lbs a piece in 6 months (yes 100 lbs total in 6 months) because we limited our intake and worked out four days a week (cardio and strength training).  It can be done but too many overeat their diet.<br /><br />UPDATED 2 March 2011<br />I just finished my second round with this video.  Why did it take me several days before doing the video again?  Partly my fault ... I don't routinely wear shoes when I'm working out in the house.  Part of this comes from my history of dancing modern ballet (I hate shoes)... however I learned the hard way that not wearing shoes resulted in my tight calf muscles.  My calves are still very tight but I thought it would be a good way to help loosen them up a little more.<br /><br />I wanted to give a couple more CONS to this video... 1) like others have stated it's very annoying to have to go through the introduction every single time.  When I want to work out I want to get started NOT listen to Jillian talk. 2) this is my biggest issue... Jillian's claims about working your abs will either get rid of the \\"pouch\\" and \\"give you abs like one of the \\"buddies\\" is more than likely false.  Getting washboard abs are a result of doing ab strengthening exercises.  However, the \\"pouch\\" and washboard abs are genetics.  Not everyone (male or female) are able to get sculpted abs no matter how hard they work.  Furthermore doing only 3 minutes of abs everyday (if you actually follow through with the video recommendation) won't give you those results anyway.  I was anorexic in high school.... I had a pouch.  That pouch for most women is something very necessary for child rearing.UPDATED 2 March 2011  I just finished my second round with this video.

B00005JKES|5.0|Twin Peaks is still a great TV show after all these years. David Lynch's directing and Angelo Badalamenti's soundtrack are an awesome combination. Acting by all cast members is fantastic! There is still nothing on TV at this time that compares. Twin Peaks was ahead of it's time and I believe had it premiered at a much later date, it would have gone much longer than 2 seasons. If you are a fan of David Lynch's work or just like shows that are different or out of the ordinary, Twin Peaks is a good choice. I recommend getting the 2 hour pilot episode {which is not included in the 1st season set} and also get the movie \\"Twin Peaks, Fire Walk With Me\\" as this movie conludes the Twin Peaks series that was canceled after 2 seasons.<br /><br />Adam Link

B002ZG981E|5.0|I am not exactly sure how anyone can say this movie was terrible.  Christopher Nolan is in a completely different class.  He writes and directs many of his movies himself, and the movies are completely original.  I have not seen many of the other movies up for best picture, but I don't see this one is not the clear favorite.  Social Network was good, but not best picture worthy.  This movie surpasses all the hype that went along with it and is, just like it's director, in another realm altogether.    I cannot say much more about this movie that hasn't been said after it's release, but this movie had me enthralled from start to finish, and the finish is what proved to me why it was so special.      The acting was amazing as well.  Leonardo Dicaprio has grown up since his days on Growing Pains, who knew the sarcatic homeless kid who outsmarted Mike Seaver would become a superstar.  Not to mention the alien kid becoming a well known actor as well.      This movie made me think, just like another film by Nolan, Memento.  Both of them totally blew me away.  Those people who say they don't understand it, really must have a hard time focusing.  It's quite clear if you keep yourself immersed in the movie.  The ending is open for interpretation, but I don't think I would've liked it as much without it.  That is what separated this movie from any other.      This movies ending is the best ending of any movie out there.  I challenge anyone to find one better.  I didn't think any movie could touch The Usual Suspects ending, but this one blew it out of the water.      The whole dream within a dream idea in this really proved interesting, and the idea of trying to plant an idea in someone's mind by having them think of it themselves.  That is totally unique and mind-provoking.
B004ETVAH0|5.0|Jeff Beck is a guitar legend. I can think of a better person to pay tribute to the musical legend of Les Paul. This disc includes excellent instrumentals like the romantic somber \\"Sleep Walk\\" and the groovy television theme \\"Peter Gunn\\". These are two instrumental pieces that I have heard for years, but I never knew the title to them. I love the sax playing on Peter Gunn very much. \\"Apache\\" is another instrumental piece that I really like.  This piece conjures up the spirit of adventure for me.  Jeff is assisted on this disc by some talented singers. Irish singer Imelda May is a very moving singer.  She performs a sensual cover of the classic tune \\"Walking In The Sand\\" that is very enjoyable to listen to. She also lends her vocals talents on the tune \\"How High The Moon\\".  This is a fun upbeat song.  Darrel Higham lends his talents on the tune \\"Train Kept A Rollin'\\". This song is upbeat and rocking. I love this track.  Gary US Bonds delivers a crowd pleaser with the tune \\"New Orleans\\". This is a song that gets me moving.  Brian Setzer performs the song \\"Twenty Flight Rock\\".  His electric guitar playing makes this track special.  This song pumps me up with such vitality. This is one of my favorite cuts on this disc. I love this music on this disc very much. I missed Jeff Beck performing these songs in New York, but honestly listening to this CD is the next best thing.
B0043ZDU1E|3.0|The problem I have with Loreena McKennitt is the exact same problem I have with Enya. They both do not know how to expand their sound beyond a few changes. In McKennitt's case, she started Celtic and then gradually introduced Arabic folk to her sound with 1991's \\"The Visit\\". But like Enya, McKennitt does not appear motivated to grow beyond that point, thus she has steadily refined what she already knows since \\"The Visit\\". Prior to that album you can hear how she continued to grow musically, but after her peak in 1994 with \\"The Mask And Mirror\\", she really hasn't grown much musically.<br /><br />So, like Enya, it's always pleasant to hear something new every few years, but there's nothing to get really excited about here. \\"The Wind That Shakes The Barley\\" is McKennitt re-visiting her Celtic roots for the first time in many years, this time with a mature, wiser perspective, but it just ends up sounding like a typical McKennitt album with nothing new. If McKennitt had not released this album I wonder if anyone would have truly minded. Every McKennitt album is good, no less than three stars, and each one has some good songs and some that are completely forgettable. Most of her albums are uneven in the sense that she rarely strikes gold and thoroughly fleshes out her songs, making each one stand on its own. You could literally exchange songs from different albums and you would not know any differently.<br /><br />So, for me, it was 1997, and my introduction to McKennitt was \\"The Mummer's Dance\\". It had hit the top 40 radio in some freakish example of how popular radio can embrace all genres of music for a minute, but not support them later on down the road. Then she was gone for a decade, theoretically mourning the loss of her fiance in 1998. Understandable. I would not have been surprised if she had never returned to music at all, but in 2006 she came back, and ever two years we are treated to her angelic voice. Her voice is her signature, and I have never had issue with her vocals. It's her musical choices and arrangements that I contest. Would it hurt McKennitt's cult following if she experimented more with her musical choices? What could she possibly have to lose? As my wife says, \\"Who is listening to McKennitt?\\" No seriously, who is listening to McKennitt, and how many copies of each album does she sell? I think she could artistically take more risks and not lose a single fan.<br /><br />Here's how McKennitt's \\"The Wind That Shakes The Barley\\" compares to her previous works:<br /><br />1985 Elemental: Four Stars<br />1987 To Drive The Cold Winter Away: Four Stars<br />1989 Parallel Dreams: Four Stars<br />1991 The Visit: Four and a Half Stars<br />1994 The Mask And Mirror: Five Stars<br />1997 The Book Of Secrets: Three and a Half Stars<br />2006 An Ancient Muse: Three Stars<br />2008 A Midwinter Night's Dream: Three Stars<br />2010 The Wind That Shakes The Barley: Three Stars's her musical choices and arrangements that I contest.

0756405890|5.0|\\"You have to be a bit of a liar to tell a story the right way. Too much truth confuses the facts. Too much honesty makes you sound insincere.\\"    If I were to list all of the things that I lvoed about this book, I would be here all day. There are so many synergistic story elements so many little quotes and plot points and parts that I enjoy that listing them would take almost as much page time as the book itself, and nobody wants to hear me gushing. Suffice to say, The Name of the Wind is an incredible book.     It is the setting that makes The Name of the Wind stand out, and it goes beyond the rather dry elements of worldbuilding. There are certainly empires and histories and cities and towns and all the important elements of a world. Furthermore, the magic is logically explained and has a deeper impact on the world than is expected from modern fantasy. But Rothfuss' creation goes beyond simple world construction. What he does better than any other author I've encountered is infuse his world with a sense of living, breathing folklore. There are children's rhymes, songs and ballads and tales and tomes of heroes and villains, as should be expected. But that's not where it ends. There are casual references, chance remarks that hint that the interconnectivity between these tales that genuinely impact the world in which his characters live. It would be a simple thing to invent a religion and a few historical tales, a few heroic ballads and the like, but it takes a true devotee to his craft to make it all spark and come alive. This is the work of an author who deeply appreciates storytelling, and genuinely understands the importance of storytelling in a largely pre-literate world. There is nothing short of reading the actual myths, legends and fairytales that Rothfuss sometimes alludes to, sometimes pokes fun at, and sometimes downright steals that would rival this book in terms of folkloric rigor. It is simply fantastic.    There is a troubling opinion that Kvothe too often wanders into Mary Sue territory; that he is so good and so clever and so sharp and so quick that he is simply a wish-fulfillment fantasy for the author with little narrative weight. This is simply not true. While it does at times seem like Kvothe is unconquerable, there are plenty of times when he behaves, in short, like a fifteen year old kid. He can be incredibly thoughtless, and because he genuinely knows how clever he is, he takes that cleverness for granted and it gets him into serious trouble. But the best argument that I can find to debunk the largely-held thought of Kvothe's Mary Sue-ism is that he is telling the story himself, and Kvothe is, before all, a storyteller. A Tale-spinner. He knows that stories follow their own patterns, owing to the fact that truth often comes at the expense of a good story. To further illustrate this, look at the following quotes:    \\"The stories will take care of themselves.\\"  \\"The best lies about me are the ones I told.\\"  \\"But you of all people should realize how thin the line is between the truth and a compelling lie. Between history and an entertaining story. You know which will win, given time.\\"    Can there be any doubt at all that Kvothe is a deeply unreliable narrator? That he is embellishing his tale, cutting corners and telling white lies, seems absolutely irrefutable. But cannily, the story asks the reader to decide which is more important: the Truth, or a good story. This handily sets up one of the main themes of the entire book, and I imagine the entire series: Storytelling. It is of absolute, paramount importance. Characters are murdered for their transgressions into crafting a story, in one emotional part. Kvothe is describing his actions and his life in the manner of a storyteller, not simply an old done man reiterating the events of his life. There is also the fact that Kvothe is actively constructing elements of his own mythos even as he's at the University. Knowing that he's at a disadvantage, he feels he must make himself bigger than he is in order to survive; it is not a stretch to imagine that this is what he's doing with Chronicler.    That is not to say that The Name of the Wind is a perfect tale, by any means. There are glaring problems that stem from Rothfuss inexperience as a professional writer. Happily, these complaints are few and have little hope of outweighing all of the excellent bits of the book.     There are a few times in which it seems - especially during the third-person framing story - that Rothfuss is deliberately overlooking details that should be shown in order to build up an artificial sense of mystery. Kote's Waystone Inn is never given a location, but names of cities and countries are thrown about in equal measure, with no real indication as to whether these places are near or far. The map helps not at all. It is a very vague, distanced map that shows only a few of those important areas where the bulk of the story takes place. While these are important, the scale of the map is such that we only really get a vague idea of the location and little else. A smaller, more detailed map of Imre, the University, and the surrounding boroughs would help considerably.     Furthermore, and this is more prevalent in the third-person frame, again, there are times when the prose leans a bit on the purple side. The first two pages, while beautifully written, are a little hammy in a re-read. Dialogue tags are frequently overused, such that it becomes rather distracting at times. Kvothe and Bast delight in saying each others' names during casual conversation three, four or five times in a row (names are important of course, but this happens to the point of unreality).    The book being, essentially, a vehicle for a storyteller to tell his own story, there are also moments where the excesses of the tale get in the way of itself. Kvothe and Chronicler would certainly know the tale of Lanre and Tehlu almost by heart, and so is the reiteration of it in Kvothe'schildhood really necessary? First-persona narratives are tricky to the point of impossibilty, and while Rothfuss handles it ably, he looks like a rank amateur compared with an old hand like Gene Wolfe. Some of this is forgivable, of course, since Rothfuss is writing for a modern audience and not a denizen of the Four Corners but that is the prime difficulty of writing a first-person tale in a separate world. There are things which would be taken for granted as being commonly understood by a viewer of that world. The sacrifice of it is easier on a modern audience, but at a cost.    To make a very short, very useless statement: The Name of the Wind is a stupendously immersive read, one capable of transporting a reader into a delightfully complex and utterly convincing otherworld. If you haven't read it yet, do yourself a favor and pick this one up.

0394721780|5.0|Book arrived in excellent condition and quickly.  My 15-year old niece for whom the book was bought has already made the vanilla souffle--something I have never attempted.  Thank you
1599219751|5.0|I read The Long Walk never once doubting that it was a true story. The book was recommended to me by a friend and I took it at face value. Reading it from this perspective I was sucked in like an bug caught in the rays of light. After finishing it, however, I did research and discovered the story may not be true. OUCH. OUCH!!! If you read some of the other reviews here you will see that some claim the tale is absolutely UNTRUE. Some base their opinions on a documentary done by the BBC in 2006. I suggest you Google the documentary. You can listen to it yourself. You'll find that validity of the story is \\"controversial\\" but it can't be proven one way or another whether it's true. At this point I tend to think it's not, however. There are too many holes in the story which I DID notice while reading it, but just passed them by believing that since the author wasn't a writer it was just his lack of \\"writing details\\" that was the problem. (a common problem with amateur writers) The biggest holes in the story are: going 12 days without water, never once having a map and no description of even looking at the sun for guidance, the author never again seeing his travel mates after the journey (for the next 60 years). How convenient. There's many more holes. Ahh... I'm very disappointed. If you haven't read the book, and decide to, you'll enjoy it a lot more if you believe every word. I read it thinking it was true. I loved it. If you have any doubts you won't enjoy it. If you want to read a gripping story in which every word is an out and out lie, check out The Find by James J Valko. :-)
B0006A9FMI|1.0|i have seen the first movie which i feel is an excellent movie but this one seems very disjointed. the story didn't flow as well as the first. also the dialogue used so many metaphors it became repetative after time. i know some were used in the first but almost every other line was a metaphor or biblical reference. the one thing that was really cool about the story was when the major shows up to help save the day. her and batou's interaction was the best part of the show. the art work for this film was amazing at times. very clean edge and the parade floats were done very well. some of the images would make great poster shots.
031603438X|5.0|A very interesting and honest look in to the life of a Great musician.  Unlike a lot of so-called autobiographies by famous people, Keith really wrote this one.  His view of the people he knew and worked with throughout his career gives an added insight that I totally enjoyed.  The English slang/terminology is sometimes \\"challenging\\", but over-all it is a very readable book. I'll be reading it again so glad I own it.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|I love the movie and watch it over and over. I remember when Secretariat won all the races.  What a wonderful story.
0312370849|5.0|Sarah,'s Key led me to a documentary called \\"L'oiel de Vichy\\" which was a German propaganda film  about the Vichy regime.  I've also read Suite Francais (I think that's the title!)  But \\"Sarah's Key\\" is a wonder and I wasn't able to put it down and disappointed when finished.
B0025UUEAE|5.0|If you are looking for a tactics book of the \\"verbal-explanation\\" type rather than of the \\"worbook-with-lots-of-problems-to-solve\\" type, then Predator at the Chessboard Volumes I & II blow the competition away (including the tactics books by Seirawan/Silman and Alburt/Palatnik).    Table of Contents (1st edition, copyright 2007; no new editions as of date of this review):  Vol I chapters: \\"Introduction\\", \\"The Double Attack\\" (further divided into forks from each piece), and \\"The Discovered Attack\\" (subdivided into discovered attacks from each piece)  Vol II chapters : \\"The Pin and Skewer\\", \\"Removing the Guard\\", and \\"Mating Patterns\\" (subdivided into back rank and classic mates)    This book is superior to other beginner tactics books for 3 reasons:    1. Appropriate difficulty for intended audience: Many chess authors have forgotten what a \\"beginner\\" is.  Farnsworth shows you several easier positions illustrating the same motif/theme then logically and incrementally progresses to more difficult versions of the theme (for instance, from the simple find-the-bishop-fork to find-the-bishop-fork-in-three).  Most of the examples in Predator at the Chessboard are 1-3 moves in depth, completely appropriate for a beginner. There isn't much in terms of lengthy alternative sidelines of analysis (>5 moves for instance) that would clearly make this book beyond a beginner/lower level (you will find lots of such lengthy analysis and difficult problems in the Seirawan/Silman and Palatnik/Alburt \\"beginner\\" tactics books).     2. Thinking method: Farnsworth doesn't give a thinking method per se, but he repetitively states simple things to think about when approaching a position, which can be helpful for someone learning tactics.      3. Numerous examples: There are greater than 1000 positions in both volumes and thus he provides dozens of examples of any given motif from simple to complex, thoroughly reinforcing the material, whereas other books show a couple token positions then proceed to give you very difficult problems.       Thus Predator at the Chessboard is accessible to the beginner/lower-level player, provides many logically progressive examples of a given motif from simple to slightly more complex, and provides verbal explanations about how to think about these tactics.       Criticisms of the book:  1. Expensive: cost me around $65 for 2 volumes hardcover, but since this is the only \\"verbal-explanation\\" type tactics book that a beginner/lower-level player needs, I believe it is money well spent if you love to play chess.  2. The 2 volumes should be 1 volume that is 700+ pages, in my opinion.  3. He uses his own notation which is not quite algebraic (for instance, RxN might mean \\"rook takes knight\\").  His book is still very easy to follow...I simply prefer algebraic notation, which is also very easy to follow.    4. I wish that the entire line of play for each position was listed at the end of its corresponding explanatory paragraph (preferably in algebraic notation).  Not only would it be a nice quick summary, but also would be good practice for those wanting to solve the >1000 positions without wading through the paragraph explanations.    Nothing beats solving thousands of tactics problems such as offered on several well known websites.  In spite of this and the above criticisms, I still give this book 5 stars because it is far and away the greatest \\"verbal-explanation\\" beginner tactics primer I have ever encountered ever.      Of course, he offers this material free on his website (you can google his name and/or Predator at the Chessboard), but it is nice to have books for those times when is no internet or computer, if I am indefinitely stuck in a line, waiting room, or side of a road, and at bedtime without having to worry about lugging around my laptop and adaptor plug.
B004MMEIK0|5.0|I have read all of Kerrelyn Sparks books. They are FANTASTIC !!!!! Once I started this book I didnt put it down until I was finished. Great author and great series. I am all caught up reading them. Can't wait for the newest one to come out in March called Vampire Mind. Keep up the good work Kerrelyn !!!!
B002ZG99TK|4.0|Comment: Although this was a completely watchable movie, I found that it had an anticlimactic ending. I like to tell a little story that describes the endings of movies like this. Seems that there was this \\"bomber\\" flying over Germany in WWII. It suddenly is hit by flack that sends it hurtling toward the ground in flames. Everyone on board is screaming \\"we are going to be killed\\". Just as they are about to hit the ground a voice comes over the intercom and announces \\"it's OK lads... we are safe... we just ran out of gas...\\"!!! The movie ending was somewhat like that.
0801896932|4.0|About half-way through, but I already appreciate the biographical information about Noether, and the overview and applications of her results to a variety of problems. The mathematical level is appropriate for upper level undergraduate physics majors and the discussion really helps place the results in context. Nice problems and thought-provoking comments at the end of each chapter. Could use more graphics, and perhaps a little more prose to address the formal mathematical subtleties, but overall, this book admirably fills the largest hole in that small bookshelf containing useful celebrations of deeply significant science and the scientists who created it.

B001CTUI8M|5.0|In two words: absolutely fantastic!    This Blue Ray certainly puts Within Temptation in the high leagues. It is top shelf in my 500 music DVD collection, probably among the top 5.     The Review:  - Sharon -   Sharon is perfect in this concert. Her ability to flawlessly switch from her pop to mezzo soprano voice, with such easiness, is a total treat to the ears. Her voice, unbelievably, sounds just like in the studio even while running through the stage, in which she shows, by the way, to be totally comfortable in. I read recently that she designs her own clothes, and that is another positive point here. Her wardrobe adds to the magic of the presentation. The energy she displays in the stage is great and certainly spreads through the crowd and band. She definetely is the heart and soul of this band.    - Dutch Metropolitan Orchestra  What a treat! I guess all fans of gothic/symphonic metal have always thought how great would be to hear these bands live with a professional orchestra. Well, Within Temptation delivers it here!!! The orchestra and the choir add that really special touch to several songs. How great is to hear real violins and choir instead of an eletronic keyboard!!!!!!    - Within Temptation (band)  Great delivery guys! The song selection, the quality of the sound, all executed perfectly. One could say that maybe the rest of the band could participate more in the performatic display, but I guess the whole point is to leave that to Sharon, giving the limelight all to her. So, 5 stars out of 5 here too.    - Stage/Visuals/Editing  The editing is one of the top features of this DVD/Blue Ray. I don't know how many cameras they used, but at times seems more than 20. The camera \\"flying\\" in the cable gives some fantastic shots, panning, twisting, and moving to give the impression of flying with an outstanding result. The quick switch between shots in key moments of the songs, sometimes with added special effects to resemble trembling or rocking increases thedelivery of the sound greatly adding to the overall experience. The pyro effects give the extra push, and the goose bumps keep piling up. The stage has good size and allow Sharon to perform and run with liberty, the 3 huge monitors above it deliver some very pretty shots, sometimes combining scenes of the music clip and the song being performed live, and that highlights another feature of this concert: Within Temptation's ability to stay true to the studio version, maintaing the tempo and rythm to perfection.     - System - Region encoding  This is the only issue with the DVD/Blue Ray. The extra DVD is encoded in PAL. So, even though it is region zero (all regions) it will not play in most US DVD players. Thankfully Blue Ray does not suffer the same problem and runs PAL or NTSC in any player.     - Overall  One of the best experiences you can put into a 5\\" plastic disk. In two words: ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!
B0017KIBAI|5.0|Received this in the mail & hooked it up (top of Wii console) & it's a gem to use. Interfaces with the Wii titles that will support the classic controller (Mario Kart, Super Smash, Mario All Stars,to name a few & all Gamecube titles)it has the rumble function. It's a perfect size for the hands ... I love the controller! it makes gaming easier, the control on Mario Kart is great ... to say nothing of playing the old classic Mario with a controller that also reflects how it was played when it came out. This was a must have for me, as I wanted to be able to play the great Gamecube titles on my Wii. It certainly is worth the extra few dollars over buying a knock off or used controller. I like it so much, think I'll order another for my son, so we can both use it during our races & Super Smash brawls ...the 10 foot cord is a blessing, since it can reach to the couch. I would buy this over the Wii classic, as this has better functionality. Order with confidence, you won't be disappointed.
B0041ZQHHA|5.0|really enjoyed this album from the first hearing... and then it got better and better... everyday a new song was my favorite. Saw Brandon live and he didn't disappoint... he is a fantastic songwriter and performer... this album needs more airplay on the radio... CAN'T wait for more from the Killers and Brandon:) 2011? please
0786715103|1.0|After seeing the inspiring film \\"Shake Hands with the Devil\\" I ordered Dallaire's book on which the film was based.  The man is in incredible hero and a true humanitarian but the book was so poorly written and boring that I did not finish it.  In my entire life, the number of books I did not finish is less than five, but unfortunately this was one of them. Ponderus, filled with so much detail that the average reader will fall asleep.  No photos to make you feel closer to the man, his colleagues and  the Rwandans.  Don't waste time with this book, but do view the film.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This movie has something for everyone; a good plot, action, suspense, humor. It is a pleasure to see such a rich assortment of actors in one adventure film. It's one of those you definiely want to watch more than once.
0743496736|2.0|First off, I've decided to stop before I've reached page 200, and well before \\"Book Club Discussion Questions\\" (what a patronising concept!) But since the author poses them, here are some more:    If death is the biggest question of all (page 145), what is the answer?    How big does a church have to be to hold the grief of its mourners (page 148)?    They're just two examples of the pretentious prose which is Ms Picoult's stock-in-trade. Book Club question: How many more can you find?
B003ZSJ212|5.0|To all those who don't like the added scenes. Skip them.   These are great movies finally made on a hi-def format. The only way to watch them.
B004MMEIK0|4.0|First let me say that I LOVED this book. The main characters were actually likable and believable, something very rare in paranormal romances these days. A pet peeve of mine is when the heroine finds out what her love interest really is (vampire, werewolf, demon, etc.) and either a)doesn't care, acts like it's no big deal, and throws herself into his arms without reservations, or b)is in total denial for half of the book regardless of the evidence right in front of her face. The heroine in this book reacted perfectly, believing what was going on when she had enough evidence but still showing the right amount of concern for what he was. The book is filled with humor and had my husband constantly asking me what I was laughing about. I stayed up pretty late last night finishing the book since I couldn't put it down. Nearly every character in this book was perfect...nearly. And that's where I get to my only problem with this book, except for the title. (The only way to tie it into the story is that the vampire is a millionaire, but that's it.) Anyway, back to my one and only real problem with the book. The villain. At the beginning he's made out to be this very old, bad-ass, extremely powerful vampire, but by the end of the book I felt he was less like Darth Vader and more like Dr. Evil. He seemed almost comical in both dialogue and action. His 'attacks' on the good guys were ineffectual and puny and he was easily defeated in the end. I found myself really pulled out of the story whenever his character was 'on' and that really bothered me. But it definitely wasn't enough of an issue to keep me from thoroughly enjoying the book as a whole. I will be looking for more books from this author in the future.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Loved the movie!! I got to meet Secretairiat years ago!!
B003TSEL7S|4.0|While this book was written for an audience younger than I (45), it was very enjoyable and entertaining. The characters were well fleshed out and thoughtfully written. If it had been a paperback I would have given it to my 15 year old neice who would have LOVED it! It has action suspense and a bit of teen angst and romance. THere is a fair dose of humor and sarcasim to keep things interesting. I think it would also make a fun movie that would attract teens and young adults in a spectacular fashion!
B002ZG99TA|4.0|This was a great movie to see on the big screen because of all the loud noises and intensity of the special effects. Not sure you will get the same show at home, but it's worth renting or borrowing. A couple funny moments too that gives the movie character.
0393327655|5.0|The End of Faith is a book that you'll want to read along with your best pen and a notebook. Harris attacks all religious faiths in this book: Christianity, Islam, Judaism and even Hinduism. Religion leaves otherwise well-intentioned people incapable of thinking rationally about many of their deepest concerns at best; at worst it is a continuous source of human violence. More important to note: Harris' statement in this book is about the danger of blind faith in ANY dogma without evidence. Secular tolerance of religion (mainly by the far-Left) by sheltering it from criticism is nearly as irrational as embracing religion itself, and potentially just as dangerous and threatening to human civilization. It is time that those who hold beliefs without evidence are pushed to the margins of society.<br /><br />There is even a lengthy segment about the political dogma of Communism, although secular in form, instilled as much genocidal unreason in it's people as religion has. \\"Nazism... was held together by a belief in the racial purity and superiority of the German people. The obverse of this fascination with race was the certainty that all impure elements - homosexuals, invalids, Gypsies, and, above all, Jews - posed a threat to the fatherland.\\" (Page 101)<br /><br />Other quotes:<br /><br />Page 66 - \\"...faith is nothing more than a willingness to await the evidence... believe now, live an untestable hypothesis until your dying day and you will discover that you were right.\\"<br /><br />Page 106 - \\"Whenever you hear that people have begun killing noncombatants intentionally and indiscriminately, ask yourself what dogma stands at their backs. What do these freshly minted killers *believe*? You will find that it is always - always - preposterous.\\"<br /><br />This book is undoubtedly academic in letter, but very engaging in form. There are no shortages of numbered footnotes in the text (the last 100 pages are all notes) that reference to the back of the book for citation and further discussion. This book is highly reccomended.<br /><br />(EDIT: There is a poster going through LITERALLY every single positive review on any book criticizing religion and offering a wall of computer-generated text. Actually, I doubt any living person could waste so much of their life commenting on reviews trying to shield their religion from criticism so I'm going to say the posts ARE computer-generated, besides the fact that they don't make any sense.)ly reccomended.

0062020897|4.0|Interesting  I say that because i can't understand out how i was able to finish this book so quickly. I guess its an easy read, which is unusual for me because i normally find books based on so much history boring. Whats weird is that i really cant find any positives to list about this book. Now don't get me wrong, this was not a bad book but was it just me or was there no climax? The book had a steady pace throughout and just when you thought it would get better, the book ended.   I cant think of one reason why i liked this book, but i do. I honestly enjoyed it, go figure!
B003NRWW58|5.0|Love it!  Stylish, sexy, terrific cast, great writing and just plain fun.  Kind of a mix between \\"X Files\\" and \\"Buffy, the Vampire Slayer\\"  tv series.  Totally addictive!  Not really for the kiddies due to differences in censorship in the USA and UK.  Hope they don't ruin it when they film it in the USA next season!  Although it is a spinoff of \\"DR. Who\\", it is much more for adults than the original.
B00003CXB4|5.0|The lion king movie is the best i seen,its really intresting but sad at the same time the best part is when simba's dad n uncle get face to face n let's go of him n he gets kild from then simba's is taking over the wild is his part n job to do now. I suggest for everybody to own a copy.
B004EPYZOY|3.0|Drive Angry has trashy B movie goodness all over it. You have your excessive gore, nudity, foul language and one laughable plot, but it all adds up to a pretty enjoyable flick. The story is beyond simplistic. A guy breaks out of hell and has to evade capture while searching for someone very important to him.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage sure has had way more misses than hits in recent years (Bad Lieutenant and Kick-Ass being the standouts), but I liked his mellow approach to this character. You would think of all movies, this would be the one he would go overboard, but he wisely tones it down a few notches. Amber Heard plays the sidekick role, which she tries to inject with toughness. It didn't always work, but she adds a dose of energy and is quite the babe. Did I say she is hot? The standout by far is William Fichtner as hell's accountant. Basically he is the dude Satan sends out when someone manages to escape. You can tell he is having a great time and like Cage, he doesn't stray into the overacting category.<br /><br />The 3-D was okay, but for a film that claims to be \\"Shot in 3-D\\" I wasn't that impressed. The CGI ranged from good to average, but for a movie like this, I didn't expect it to be polished.<br /><br />If you liked Planet Terror, Death Proof or Piranha 3-D, you should have a blast with this one. It's cinemas equivalent to greasy fast food among the current Oscar nominated fillet minions.
0307454541|1.0|Reading this book was torture. I can't believe I have good friends that read and loved this book--funny the same people liked \\"The Stand\\" too, which I neve got through it was so boring.<br /><br />To say the least this book starts slow, if you must read it, start at oh say page 175, you won't miss a thing. The mystery was no mystery at all if you have half a brain and I have really never been more unsatisfied with the last few pages of a book.<br /><br />People I read 2-3 books a week, trust me, take a pass on this one.<br />NWE
B0042JIL2E|2.0|I wanted to love Imelda May -- I love discovering new artists -- but she just doesn't make it. Like a talented singer trying out styles but not yet ready for prime time.  I suspect she may be great live, but this CD is painful.  In contrast to others who found the musicians and her voice amazing, she's doing a disfavor to American jazz, blues, R&R.  She's seems to do best at \\"rockabilly/country\\" and slower tunes that show off her vocals.  It was a disappointing production, especially after all the positive reviews.
B000XXI8EO|5.0|Las botas están muy bien, tienen un aspecto muy bueno y de calidad, lucen mucho. Yo también las tuve que pedir una talla menor porque las tallas no están bien, para haceros una idea, casi siempre ando entre una EU 42-43, que seria un USA 9 y en esta he pedido un USA 8 que es un EU 41,5 y aunque me quedan bien me hubiese gustado poder probar una talla menor a ver si me quedaba mejor. En cuanto a la tienda Papashoe, todo muy bien, en un principio no respondieron y Amazon me envió un correo diciendo que la tienda no confirmaba el envió y que me devolvían el pago, pero tras ponerme en contacto con Papashoe me dijeron que el pedido estaba a punto de ser enviado, al siguiente día me cobraron de la tarjeta y el pedido ha llegado perfecto, además, se han portado y en el coste de las botas declararon 20$ y no me han cobrado nada en la aduana. Gran compra sin duda.
B001S86J1C|1.0|I got the blu-ray as a package with another one and first of all it did not have the white sticker at the top of the box indicating that it hadn't been opened, and second of all then I sat down to watch it the quality was horrible. The sound didn't match the picture and I had to stop watching it because it just got worse. I'm really unhappy with this product.
0307455874|5.0|When writing a review of a President's book, written two years into his Senate term, while he is two years into his Presidency, is not necessarily the ideal circumstance for an objective review. Those on the left may have the predisposition to denounce this book as an article of unfulfilled promises; others would denounce this as nothing more than a propaganda piece and a launch pad for a Presidential campaign. It is the intention of the following review to take neither of the aforementioned positions, and rather to review the book on its own merits and the circumstances under which it was written, turning a blind eye to the author's Presidency.   While The Audacity of Hope is clearly a political book, but what is not so clear is what kind of political book it is. Is it a memoir, a political manifesto, a historical analysis, or a current affairs analysis? In many ways it is all of the aforementioned, and ably weaves its components into a highly readable narrative.   The political memoir aspect of the book is essentially its beginning and its end. Throughout the book Obama provides many insights from his own life that has shaped his view of the world, but essentially the sections of the book that are most purely a retelling of the author's political experience occur both at the beginning and the end. The author was familiar with the events taking place, perhaps the most familiar being the controversy in 2005 over the stalling of President Bush's judicial nominees, and the suggested remedy \\"the nuclear option\\" (the use of a political officer, most likely the Vice President, to remove the filibuster on judicial nominees) and the compromise crafted by 7 Senators of each party to preserve the filibuster and not use it except in \\"extraordinary circumstances\\" (the ambiguity of such a term was perceived by both the author and this reader).   Within the early chapters are contained insights into Barack Obama's own legal philosophy, essentially of the \\"Living Constitution\\" school of thought, as opposed to the Strict Constructionist approach. While this reader has been more beholden, and in many ways still am, to the Strict Constructionist model of judicial thinking, this was undoubtedly the best written, and most compelling argument for the Living Constitution this reader has yet read, and it is a clear strength of the book.   The following chapters, those on Society, Economy, Race, Religion, and World Affairs give a great insight into the political thinking of its author. The extent to which they have been exercised within the offices the author has held this reader cannot adequately analyze, and nor is it the purpose of this review to do so, however they do give insight into the author's then political leanings.   The author makes a very good case for the benefits of Globalization and the fruitlessness of protectionism and other attempts to isolate oneself from the World Economy. He recalls this with his disaffected constituents in mind, explaining that he always had thought of those who were at the losing end of Globalization, those losing work, whenever he thought out his policy positions.   The chapter on Race clearly does not read like it was written by Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton. While recalling events such as the funeral of Rosa Parks, the author makes a case over how the current status of minorities in the USA requires a break from precedence as much for the minorities themselves as it does from society and government.   The chapter on Religion is one of the books strengths. Herein the author reveals himself to be very much a centrist on this matter. In no way does he adopt any far left positions against prayer in schools, public displays of religious symbols, but at the same time makes a very good case of the importance of rendering unto Caesar. With insight from his own faith, this chapter contains no condescension or self-righteousness, or at least none that this reader can discern, and deserves to be quoted and referencedat any debate regarding the role of religion in society.   The chapter that most strongly struck a chord with this reader was the chapter on World Affairs. Beginning with the author's experience in Indonesia, and an overview of the world's fourth most populous country, Obama draws on the role of Globalization, the threats facing the United States and the world at large, and America's role in the world. While he is clearly a multi-lateralist, he makes a very pragmatic argument. He understands the failings and outdated structure of the United Nations, but at the same time speaks of the merits of drawing consensus and the importance of the international community. Those who would term him an appeaser or \\"soft\\" on particular issues of national security or proliferation, will find it hard to do so at least from this chapter. The author clearly shows his understanding of history, and writes a very pragmatic treatise on foreign policy.   The final chapter on family is very autobiographical, drawing on his own experiences in balancing family commitment with his various roles, from being a community organizer, a lawyer, a State Senator, and a United States Senator, but at the same time reveals a pragmatic approach to the breakdown of family relations within the United States, and how society and government can offset certain trends.   The Epilogue is in many ways a recount of his early days as a United States Senator, in some ways tying in with the opening of the book.   In all a very readable and thoughtful book, which should be approached by all, regardless of political persuasions. This book dispels many of the caricatures, which his opponents have sought to personify him as, and proves that he is indeed a patriot in his own way. A thoughtful and readable book that should be approached without preconceptions and read as the thoughtful narrative it is.
B003Q6CUAI|5.0|I began ten days ago and lost 3 kg. ok you can eat only specific food but as much as you want! perfect for me! still 16 to loose. we ll see.
B003V5K0AQ|4.0|I originally saw this short when I was in elementary school, some time in the 90s. (It's also included on my Special Edition DVD of The Nightmare Before Christmas, so I watched it again more recently.) The movie is in black and white, and since it's by Tim Burton, it feels similar to his other films at times with the dark and grainy look. Frankenweenie is a fantastic take on the story of Frankenstein. A young boy named Victor is obsessed with making B-type movies with his dog, Sparky. He gets hit and killed by a car one day, and the boy isn't ready to let him go. Using what he learned from Biology class, Victor brings Sparky back to life! The acting is fun and campy, and why wouldn't it be with actors like Daniel Stern, Shelley Duvall, and Barret Oliver from [[ASIN:B00005LKHZ The Neverending Story]]?! Visually, even without color, this film is fun. Victor's attic and experiments involve very crazy contraptions, and odd toys shaped like bats and rocking horses. Something I really enjoyed was a minor character named Anne Chambers (who is played by a young Sofia Coppola). She was a hilarious little girl with a bad blonde pigtail wig/dye job. My favorite scene from the entire movie involves her. She's actually making a Barbie doll exercise, and says, \\"Barbie, you're not working hard enough!\\" That's just an example of the kooky and fun language from the film. Mix that with the very normal style of dress and clean suburban neighborhood, and you've got that good old Tim Burton formula that's been repeated in films like [[ASIN:B0000AC8LI Edward Scissorhands]], [[ASIN:B0000VD04M Ed Wood]], and [[ASIN:B001AIRUOU The Nightmare Before Christmas]]. I only give this 4 stars out of 5, because when I compare this to Tim Burton's more well-known short, Vincent, it's obviously not as appealing or immersive. With less than 30 minutes, you've got to completely wow me to get 5 stars. ;)
0312570740|5.0|A well balanced, written book that tells the truth about the man who was falsly hunted by the 'Eastablishment' until pardoned by President Clinton. Don't miss this great book.
030746363X|5.0|The book arrived on my doorstep on a particularly rough day.  I sat down for about an hour and had three actionable ideas.  I scheduled a bodline analysis, started putting cinnamon in my coffee, and rebuilding my body.    Got the book in December and today, near the end of February, I have reduced bodyfat significantly and can't wait for my march bodline analysis to get the hard numbers.
0060763280|4.0|Very interesting to understand the law of attraction and how it works. Creating an energetic field in ressonance with \\"having more than enough\\" is very powerful. Fun, entertaining and easy to read.<br />Great !
B00275EHJQ|5.0|Absolutely loved this movie so much, I bought the entire series. My favorite characters are the dinosaur and the pig. I'm new to Blu-Ray and this DVD has me convinced that this is the way to go. No matter what age you are, Disney and Pixar have found a way into everyone's heart. I highly recommend the Toy Story series to anyone.
B004BJMEO6|1.0|I don't wish to be snarky but this was a disappointing and honestly dreadful movie.  I'm a genuine supporter of LBGQT film and delighted at the thought of a well-done, realistic lesbian film. Sad to say, this was not that.  Though the actresses are physically lovely, the acting is wooden and unbelievable.      And the script is so cliched and heavy-handed that the acting by comparison is Oscar quality. So you can only imagine... Let's see, the movie begins with a ponderous, obnoxious voiceover by a guy reciting every spiritual cliche in the world about soulmates and love.  If this was a campy, self-aware humor piece, how fabulous.  But he's intoning each sentence with seeming piety as if he's conveying profound truths that in fact could be gotten from any fortune cookie or hallmark card.    Sorry to say it's downhill from there.  Loud invasive music at every turn, especially during sex scenes to make sure you know what to think or feel.  Every plot twist is telegraphed far ahead with everything but whistles and red flashing lights.  The director seems to so distrust the innate smarts of her audience she has to hammer everything over and over.  And over.    But hey, if you don't need subtlety, intelligence or wit in your cinema, you might enjoy this.  Otherwise let me suggest a few other lesbian movies that show cinematic restraint and power:  Desert Hearts, The Gymnast, Bound, Before Night Falls.  Those leave this feeling like an half-baked project for a high school film class.  I'm sorry to write so frankly but I felt a need to warn anyone about to waste twenty dollars here.  A writer friend who saw it called me and said, \\"I had to bail after 20 minutes. There just are no words.\\"     Agreed.  I am truly happy the director and her partner found happiness together.  Just wish they had either made a different movie about it, or none at all.
0439023521|5.0|I read all three books in the Hunger Games Trilogy, one immediately after the other, turning each page with bated breath eager to find out what would happen next.  This was an awesome read!
B001G50QCU|5.0|I've always enjoyed the Smallville Series and this season is no exception. I'm just waiting to see if Clark/Superman learns to fly before the end of the Ninth Season.
193413712X|5.0|After having read some really poorly written books in the past few weeks (and not finishing them), it was so wonderful to pick up real writing again. Top notch, breathtaking writing; no hackneyed phrases, really beautiful, original metaphors and a clear reverence for language on the part of the author. It's just amazing that there's so much drivel out there compared to something like this.
B0007ZEO4G|5.0|Burn is one of those albums where everything just gelled. With Ian Gillan and Roger Glover out of the band, Deep Purple were at a crossroads when the then unknown singer David Coverdale and Trapeze's singer/bass player Glenn Hughes came on board. Little they knew when they went back to Montreux in November 1973 to record their new album that this new line-up would yield such a brilliant masterpiece which would rank up there with Machine Head.    Definitely more varied than their previous efforts, Deep Purple managed to reinvent themselves in the process. Burn covers quite a lot more ground and still sounds alive and fresh. The sharing of vocals by Coverdale and Hughes is amazing to say the least; Ian Paice's drums are impressively solid and creative throughout; Jon Lord throws a lot of colours and textures into the songs while Ritchie Blackmore truly shines.     All tracks from the opening of Burn to the ending of \\"A\\" 200 are absolute winners and the addition of the great instrumental piece Coronarias Redig on this excellent remastered and expanded edition makes it even more worthwhile. An absolute classic.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This was the most amazing book ever.  I loved every bit of the history, the darkness, the legend, the myth and the passion. It is a sort of grown up combination of Harry Potter and Twilight and Shiver and Bewitched!!!  It is rapturous and beautifully written and every page was a wondrous addiction.  Deborah Harkness has created an amazing world of history, vampires, daemons, witches and humans. I am such a fast reader but for this book I slowed my pace, I reread and I savored.  It is a magnificently woven story and I have nothing but admiration for this author and an intense hope that there might be a Book Two...
B00009UTQD|5.0|Not much to say other than it's better than carrying around five filter's in their large OEM plastic cases.  I use the Tamrac 5 filter case for CPL's, IR Pass, UV pass, and graduated ND.  I use the Tamrac 3 filter case for ND.  Between the two cases, I can hold all eight filters with easy access.    It's really pretty cool, you can keep it in the bag, attached to the side of a bag, or in a pocket.  It's very quick to grab a filter or put one back.    All my filters are 77mm, and there is plenty of room to fit them
0061091480|5.0|This is a great little book that is easy to read and has some very good information. It has given me some tools to use to help me stop believing that I can't be a happy person and that I can become the person I want to be.  I didn't realize before that I was always believing in the lies I was telling myself about not being good enough and that nothing would ever work out for me.  Now I know they are lies and that now I can start telling myself the truth and then I will be able to achieve the better things and feel better about me and my life.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This really a very entertaining film.  The cast is perfect. It is an enjoyable couple of hours.  Reading the Amazon reviews, the reviewers hail the main characters but fail to mention one cast member: Ernest Borgnine.  He is in two short scenes but this 90 something gentleman is just great.  It is good to see him still performing in films.  You get a warm feeling watching him perform.  The rest of the cast is, of cource, fantastic.  Great movie.
B000SMWUPS|3.0|This product is ok, but really have to watch when you collapse your stroller as mine got bent very easily.  It's never been the same so I guess you should really remove it each time.  That's not going to happen for me.  It bends back to shape, but it's always going to be kinked.  Hard to remove sticky spills or crumbs in the corners as it's nylon fabric.  Good for the price.
B0002F6BRE|1.0|I cannot stand the Infinifilm version of this film. I can't locate the special features such as the commentary or the deleted scenes. It's a HUGE MAZE to get anywhere and I still haven't figured out this Infinifilm stuff. Why can't they have a regular DVD version of Elf where you can watch the commentary with just 1 or 2 clicks??? I've had this version since Christmas 2010 and still can't navigate through this maze.
044654759X|4.0|It is hard for me not to enjoy any Nicholas Sparks book. I am a big fan and have been since I read his first book. The book kept my interest. However, for me the subject matter was a little dark. I understood the premise of the book. Overall it was easy reading as are most of his book.s
B001R4CKGU|2.0|The story line is hard to follow and is lost in the flowery dialogue.  Characters are not well defined
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|I must say I purchased this CD for one song. After listening to it a few times I love the whole thing.  It's been #1 on my ipod for a couple months now.  If you enjoy listening to groups like Lady A and Sugarland you'll love this CD.
B003EYVXTG|3.0|This'll be a short 'un as there's jus' not all that much t'say.  There are interesting moments that keep this grim foray into an even grimmer world just on the edge of being compelling enough to stick with all the way through. I did... and while I'm not angry that I did so, neither am I thankful. I'm left flat with little to no insight as to the purpose of making such a film. Jennifer Lawrence's stoic portrayal most likely exhibited all that was asked of her and John Hawkes is, as always, interesting to watch, but could have risen to a more challenging script. Oh, well.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Gods of the Arena came about due to the illness of Andy Whitfield (godspeed on a full recovery), so in essence, this isn't part of the Spartacus: Blood and Sand story, but rather a prequel.  The show, is different, and yet the same.<br /><br />We've still got Quintus and Lucretia (who deserve each other) constantly plotting against all that gets in the way of their devious pursuits of fame and power.  In addition, we get the back story of Oenomaus, Crixus, and Ashur, who play important roles in the Blood and Sand series.<br /><br />We also get to see the building moral decline of Quintus and Lucretia through their association with Gaia, and the seedy elements she brings to the House of Batiatus.<br /><br />Spartucus:  Gods of the Arena exceeded my expectations, and was a wild ride well worth watching.<br /><br />There are plenty of twists and turns that will keep the viewer guessing, and most often they don't turn out the way one would expect.
B0018QOIXU|4.0|I never heard of Adele until her big hit Rolling In The Deep; I absolutely love that song from her latest CD so I bought Adele21 and instantly fell in love with the entire CD!  This motivated me to buy this CD Adele19 next.  I did not have at all the same reaction.  Admittedly I only listened to this CD once hurriedly in the car taking my son to middle school and flipped to the next song quickly because I wasn't getting the incredible feeling of WOW that I was hoping for.  Chasing Pavements I love but the overall vibe of the CD is that Adele's voice is interesting but the songs are a bit boring for the most part.  I have never seen somebody IMPROVE so much as Adele because her latest CD Adele21 is a masterpiece!  There was no need for me to get used to the songs because the instant I heard them they blew my mind and often broke my heart. With Adele19 I will continue to listen to it because I suspect some songs may grow on me in time.  I'm a definite fan of this artist now, Adele rocks!  I must admit I am surprised to see several reviews of Adele21 where people say Adele19 is better, the reverse of what I say, because in my mind no way; Adele21 is one of the best CD's I ever heart and Adele19 is not even close to that ranking for me.
B0049P1VHS|3.0|This show is great, probably one of the best in the zombie genre to even rival Romero.  However, this set is not needed.  6 episode and call it a volume?  Someone has been taking their cues from the family guy folks.
B004E547D8|4.0|My wife and I watched this movie one evening.  It turned out to be quite a bit better that we expected.  Of course there is a lot of shooting and explosions, at times absolute mayhem.    But it was quite a treat to watch this great cast interact with each other.  The story was a bit of a stretch, but hey, if it permits the likes of Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, & Helen Miren to work together in an improbable plot, then just sit back and enjoy it.    Movies like this are meant to entertain, not have the viewer scrutinize each and every scene for authenticity.  It is meant to be an imaginary flick.  For the characters to sometimes do the impossible, well, that is what makes this movie a kick to watch.    I would recommend this movie to most of my friends and acquaintances.  But not to the ones whose expectations aren't realized when belief must be suspended in favor of fiction that involves a lot of noise and mayhem
B002ZG98C8|1.0|This movie was probably one of the WORST movies I ever saw.  Waste of Steven Seagal's talent.  I know maybe this is how Robert Rodriguez does all his movies but find some mediocre actors and actresses for a film this bad.  Don't waste such good talent.  It was more of a comedy than anything else.  Don't buy this movie.  Rent it and then throw it out.
B004GTLFNW|5.0|This book has become my new training bible. I've always been an active guy and I love to do a lot of recreational sport, skiing, snowboarding, football, beach volleyball, surfing, etc. So, when I don't have time to take part in a sport I've always tried to keep fit with weights etc. However, recently I've changed jobs and my new job requires me to commute a lot. I leave really early and come back home late. No time for sports no time for the gym. This book solved my training conundrum perfectly. Now I can bang off a quick 30min work-out over lunch or early in the morning. The absence of any need for weights or apparatus is the key seller for me. I never thought I could get such a great workout using my office desk! If your the kind of person who likes to keep fit, be strong and doesn't mind thinking outside the box a little, this book is for you.
B003ZK58WM|5.0|No long wordy reviews are needed. This book is chock-full of drama, romance, and, of course, history all interwoven into an excellent epic tale. Fall of Giants is required reading for any true historical fiction buffs. Ken Follett has done it once again!
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|Overview:<br /><br />This PG-13, 103 minute movie can be considered to be a Drama/Action Film with a sprinkling of comedy. The film centers mainly on Elise Clifton-Ward (Angelina Jolie). She is being watched and trailed  in Paris by French police working with Scotland Yard. However, a certain mobster also has a keen interest in her, because her male companion, an investment banker, has stolen a vast sum of money from him.<br /><br />Plot:<br /><br />Elise receives a mysterious letter from the very illusive Alexander Pearce, a former lover, with explicit directions to board a train to Venice, Italy. The curious thing about this is that no-one knows exactly what Mr. Pearce looks like. The plan is for Elise to find a stooge or decoy on the train, that everyone will take for Mr. Pearce. That's where Frank Tupelo (Johnny Depp) comes into the picture.<br /><br />Venice:<br /><br />This city was a wonderful selection for this movie. It stretches across 117 small islands in the marshy Venetian Lagoon along the Adriatic Sea in northeast Italy. Because of its unique characteristics, it yields itself to some very interesting in city boat chases.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />Nowadays where movies are laced with tons of CG to make the impossible appear to be able to happen, it is quite refreshing to see a film where the onus is instead placed upon the actors themselves as well as the atmosphere of the locations. This gives this film a genuine feel of intrigue that has not been artificially embellished by the magic of computers.<br /><br />Some may say that this film is `boring' because of this, but I think that it allows the film to come across in a more sincere manner, and it feels like a breath of fresh air.
B003GK2216|1.0|Wow, this was a dissapointment. A book based on some simple ideas like withheld love, brotherly friction and aggressions, the struggle for supremacy between several persons, and this is repeated ad nauseam through hundreds of pages in two successive books... Simply, but awfully boring.  Add virtually no knowledge in depth about the period the author settles his story in, add a modern stance towards actions happening in mediaval times without any convincing reason for the actors to possess modern stances, and this is what you get: two books which would be no loss at all if they hadn´t been written at all.  If you want to struggle through two books in order just to finish them, notwithstanding all the tedium they create, Ken Follett´s Kingbridge novels is all you got to get.
B000008LOV|5.0|All these musicians come together so beautifully---each member has their own song w/ all others performing so you have each musicians style.  Then they have their own style that really captures listeners.  Very singable songs.  Id say I liked every song on this cd--which I played again & again.  Great sound !!
0345457692|5.0|I have loved sci-fi since I was a kid, and I have never read as good a sci-fi tale as this one. Better than Neuromancer, better than Mote in God's Eye... dark, violent, morally ambiguous, and (for once) a few new ideas in a genre full of rehashed ones.     Altered Carbon is the first and the best of the Kovacs series. If you love this one, you'll certainly want to read the other ones.
044656740X|5.0|Great book. Really gets you thinking about money and how you handle it. Gives a very different perspective on life and wealth.
0762761296|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It made me very gratful for my freedoms and the many things I take for granted. Big and small. I am very blessed in this life and have much to be thankful for. Reading this story of the struggles these men had and the sacrifices they made for their freedom was inspiring. The human spirit is truly amazing. This book really made me aware of the gifts and blessings I have in life.
B000069HKH|5.0|It's interesting...and amusing....to see such a wide variety of reviews and opinions on this album....from 5 star reviews all the way down to one star reviews. It just goes to show that everyone is different, i guess.  Some of the one star reviews seem to be more political ramblings than actual musical reviews....due to the fact that some of the songs are related to 9/11....but, oh well.    As for me.....while i am not traditionally a big Springsteen fan... i have to say that i think this is one of the best pop/rock albums of the last 20 years or so.  There is not a bad song on this entire album.  I HIGHLY recommend it!
B004OEJMZM|5.0|Having read many books on C++ etc, I found this to be among the best - though it obviously doesn't focus on C++.  I last read an O'Reilley book on the linux kernel and thought that was a good book too. However, this is far better for an application or system's programmer who's not generally recompiling the linux kernel.    The only bad thing I can say about the book is that I left it in the trunk of a limo on the way to a bachelor party weekend :(  As good as the book was, it's probably just as well ;)  The book is also a bit heavy to carry around at >1,400 pages, so I'm considering buying it with an e-reader.
0307877523|4.0|This is a very good, well documented and step by step explanation of what might be the most deadly medical myth in the western world today.  There are several others throughout history, many recent.

Pure reason might form a good hypothesis (cals in, cals out), but it must be verified and demonstrated.  The low-carb hypothesis always proves true for weight loss.<br /><br />But there is one horrible, annoying flaw, at least with the audiobook, as I don't know if the print text uses the correct word.<br /><br />The correct word is caUSal as in \\"cause and effect\\".  What he says at least 5 times is the word \\"caSUal\\" or is dyslexic with regard to the U and the S.  Casual, as in not dressing up on friday, means the opposite.<br /><br />Just before the end of the 6th audio track, it is worse.  \\"CaSUalty\\" like the euphemism for war losses?  I think you mean \\"CaUSality\\", A causes B.  At least in the english used here in the ca-USA-l ocality.<br /><br />I am making it my pet cause to inform you of the casual manner in which you are treating the english language.<br /><br />And the author spurred me to follow his advice (mainly Paul Thurrott and Leo Laporte on twit.tv)  I wasn't unhealthy, and ate healthy balanced meals that even moderated the carbs, but I had a lot of stubborn fat.  Right now I've cut them back severely and I'm dropping weight quickly and don't feel hungry, but I remember years ago my mother went on a similar diet and it worked too.  I didn't know the science was so screwed up.
B0043X8M0K|1.0|Ok, my Wife and I absolutely love the series, have seen every episode. The songs contained on the Soundtrack suck! The really good songs that are not on the CD but are shown on TV are the good songs. One of the best song \\"All I Need - Within Temptation\\" is not on the Soundtrack. Simply put, The Soudtrack itself sucks..not worth the money you put out for it.
B003K16P3M|5.0|I loved this book! Its characters, the way the author empowered the women in the story. I loved Katsa and Po !! I want more! Where is the second book?
0525951652|4.0|Fall of Giants is part of the Century Trilogy.  The book follows five families, in Europe and the USA, as to make their way through the twentieth century.  This first book in the trilogy takes place just prior to WWI through a few years after.  The members of the five families interact and are connected in many ways as WWI starts and progresses. In this epic work (almost 1000 pages), the characters are more fully developed and multi-dimensional, as compared to previous Ken Follett thrillers.  Much of the action concern real events and historical figures, such as Woodrow Wilson and Winston Churchill. If you enjoyed Ken Follett's, Pillars of the Earth, I think you will enjoy this book.
B003L20ICE|3.0|It seems to me the moral of the story is, if you're a lesbian couple then don't invite your sperm donor into your lives otherwise he'll make one of you temporarily \\"switch teams\\" so he can have a brief affair and antagonize your relationship with the children?  I didn't really have any expectations for the movie and I barely knew what it was about going in.  It's too bad because the acting was pretty good all around and the plot was intriguing and kept my attention.  The resolution of the characters and their conflicts however is where the movie just fails for me.  I get the filmmakers don't want to be predictable but the end of the movie had me not liking this family very much at all.  Maybe that was the point, I don't know.  Why build up a flawed but likeable character in Mark Ruffalo throughout the movie only to have the family members basically relieve themselves in his face when he doesn't deserve it and then just go on with their lives like nothing happened?  I suppose the Paul character goes from being content with his free spirit life to wanting to settle down with a family.  The other characters hardly go anywhere.  By the end of the movie Nic is still the same self-centered insecure mother she was before.  Jules is still indecisive and overly dependent on people for attention.  Laser does dump his jerk of a friend but doesn't do much else the rest of the movie.  Joni kisses her friend who apparently shares the same feelings but then that's it.  She just goes off to college.  The movie wasn't terrible but certainly not deserving of the Oscar attention it has gotten.
0141040343|5.0|I'm reviewing the Penguin Classics edition rather than the content of the novel itself (which is wonderful).  The cover is beautifully decorated, nicely textured, and sturdy, the introduction and notes are interesting but not obtrusive, the paper is high quality, the print is very readable (the font is not too small like some other editions of classic literature), and the colored ribbon adds a touch of refinement as well as utility.  I've bought the other Austen novels in this Penguin series.  They're among the most handsome books on my library shelf.  Highly recommended.
076115678X|5.0|I'm so happy with how much this book has helped me take better care of my naturally curly hair...the home-made recipes are way fun to put together and the results are fantastic! My unruly, dried-out locks have become much smoother with actual curl seperation (!) and the annoyingly persistent frizz factor has become completely manageable with the sumptious moisture concoctions that I now use on a regular basis!  I've recommended this book to others that I know with the fortunate curl appeal, and my reaction is well-matched to date.  This is a must-have book!
B003GEDLW6|5.0|I love this album! After Hold Your Color and In Silico, I could wait for their next entry and they didn't disappoint.  There more popular song \\"The Island\\" is really good but Crush and Set Me On Fire are also excellent.  In fact I like the entire album and can listen to it over and over.  Hopefully their next one won't take so long to reach the US.
B004E547D8|5.0|This movie is great fun - lots of action, great stars and a little romance. Definitely happy to add it to my collection.
1589944607|5.0|This was a great game, my friends and I have just recently begun playing board games more seriously and we loved the simplisity mixed with the strategy of Battlestar. Just a quick word of warning, we have so far played two games of BAttlestar and both have exceeded four hours in length, with our longest reaching nearly six hours in length, and we only got two thirds of the way to the end objective. In short, if you have plenty of time, this is a great game, if you want a quick game this is not for you.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Bruce is his hilariously deapaned and sly self and kicks ass!  Everyone of the actors nials it in this wildly insane send up I loved it!! If every film these days was this fun I'd buy em all.
B003UBTX72|3.0|Started reading this book and really liked it a lot at first but I just cant seem to finish reading it.    I suppose it is because I'm not really interested in the music industry or maybe because I don't really find stuff like how to make a record interesting, like how they made certain sounds and 'overlaying' on record machines and that kind of stuff very interesting to me.    But the other stories Keith tells:  yes!  I love it!  I love reading things that happened to the person.  Personal stuff.    I'm sure I'll finish the book. I'm just stuck because I'm at a part that Keith is telling about the making of some record or how the industry is evil or whatever...I'll get over this part and I'm sure read more stories about Keith personally and the things he experienced being a Rolling Stone.   (I love the Stones and the music they make.)
