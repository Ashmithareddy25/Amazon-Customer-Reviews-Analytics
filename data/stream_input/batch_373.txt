B0000DD7LB|1.0|honestly this has to be the worst Album to date....she can't sing ,and she definitly can't act .........even giving this cd a 1 is taking it to far this cd really should not even be on store shelfs......i really can't stand her and what about her little *stunt* with madonna it was just a publicity act and with me i just thought it was just wrong but please DON'T BUY THIS CD IT WILL BE THE WORST CD YOU WOULD EVER BUY!!!!!!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS AMAZING! Its better than I thought it would be.<BR>My fave songs on the album are &quot;Fighter&quot;, &quot;walk away&quot;, &quot;Infatuation&quot;, &quot;Loving for me&quot; &quot;dirrty&quot;, &quot;underappreciated&quot; and &quot;Impossible&quot;. OMG! THE SONG IMPOSSIBLE IS AMAZING! ALICIA KEYS IS GREAT! Christina has a phenomenal voice and she wrote most of the songs on here. The second half of the album isnt as good as the first, but i stil love it! EVERYONE SHOULD BUY THIS ALBUM!<BR>&quot;Stripped&quot; along with &quot;Justified&quot;=BEST ALBUMS OF 2003. I LOVE CHRISTINA SO MUCH MORE AFTER BUYING THIS ALBUM! SHE RULES!
B0000C9JCM|5.0|This cd is absolutely amazing.  It was suggested to me by a faculty member at my school, so I went out and got it.  This has to be the best investment into classical music I have ever made.  No joke.  It really captures the true ellegance of his Cannon in fifteen variations, including a piano duo (my personal favourite track).  If you are looking for a classical cd, and want something that you can listen to while sitting next to the fire, sipping your coffee/tea, THIS IS THE ONE!!<BR>You won't be disappointed - I guarantee it.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Even after 6 years of being out of the music scene, Sarah McLachlan continues to perform as excellent as ever. It is in no way less than any of her previous works and is a tribute to her talent and abilty. Sarah has an innate musical ability that lasts through time and this album will not disappoint you.
B00005JM02|5.0|Finding Nemo is an unforgettable movie. Very close to perfection. I'am an Reef Aquarium entusiast and were amazed by the perfect details in the movie. Both children and adults will love it, for sure.
B000002MZ6|5.0|I can listen to this over and over and have shared it with friends and family since I first heard it.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.  The book upon which it was based is also excellent.
0790729725|5.0|As I have the same complaint about the DVD being a single layer (having to flip over in the middle of the movie) the good news is I just read at digitalbits.com is that the Special Edition is going to be released this year in July. Hurrah!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|The new britney record is so amazing, every song is hot with sick beats and is defeintly worth every penny...standout tracks are defeintly Toxic,Boom Boom,and Outrageous....Britney has sure grown up and has surprised many of us!!!! and to all those people who are giving In the zone bad reviews just because of her wedding and allument are pathetic...you should at least give the record a spin before opening ur mouth...just shows u have no life!!!! but anyway...everyone should own it...i just became a britney fan because of this CD!!! (surprise) so rember to pick it up!! peace
B000001FTJ|3.0|For someone who prefers Waits' singing voice on those big tuneful ballads, this album is a bit of a shock. In The Neighbourhood, although a spectacular example of aforementioned style, is the only representative on Swordfishtrombones. With its beautiful melody line and gripping chorus, it ranks with other Wait greats like Old 55, Saving All My Love For You and I Hope That I Don't Fall In Love With You.<br />The rest of the album is an exploration of his talking vocal style, with jazzy or bluesy arrangements providing the backdrop to his Beat poetry. Of the three instrumentals, I prefer Just Another Sucker On The Vine with its lovely interplay between harmonium and trumpet. The gentle Soldier's Things and Town With No Cheer are also lovely ballads, but with a lounge jazz feel.<br />Many of the songs have a theme of travelling and being out of place and out of time. Swordfishtrombones is certainly a very accomplished album on which Waits honed many of his inimitable styles, but besides Neighborhood I do not find many of the songs personally appealing, thence the three stars. For those of his fans that like his rasping voice and spoken style, this is a five star album.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I saw Led Zeppelin at Kezar Stadium in San Francisco in 1973. The mighty Zeppelin was at their peak and the world was at their feet. This Dvd captures the gritty intensity of Zeppelin at their best. It truly showcases the talents of  four supremely gifted musicians. The sound quality is excellent. The camera work makes you feel like you were there. This performance took me back. Way back. It made me remember that Zeppelin truly was the greatest band ever. If I could own only one dvd, this is it. A must have for all Zeppelin fans.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|The first thing I noticed about Alicia Keys is PASSION! I printed the lyrics from another site since they were not included in the album information and I was not truly impressed with all of the lyrics.  HOWEVER, when Alicia sings them I FEEL something SO powerful.  She is truly gifted.  I can see her soul, feel her pain, know her desires.  I am very proud of her and pray for her happiness and success all ways.<br />Michelle<BR>SLC, UT
B000021XS0|5.0|Ridiculous musical chops combined with a flair for storytelling and catchy riffs and hooks.  Easily the best album I own, not to mention edging out the other Dream Theater efforts.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|My former roommate produced the &quot;Concert for Bangla Desh&quot; and, for the past 31 years I thought that was the best &quot;compilation&quot; event I have ever attended. <br />However, &quot;Concert for George&quot; is all that- and more. While many of the performers are the same - Clapton, Starr, Preston, this time there were three weeks of rehearsals - and it shows.<br />If there were a six star category available I'd try to award seven. I've owned this two disc set for about three weeks and I've watched it at least a dozen times. It would have been more but I keep loaning it to friends.<br />It's hard to pick out the highlights out of something that has nothing but great entertainment but, if you twisted my arm I'd say &quot;Beware of Darkness&quot; by Eric Clapton, &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; (Clapton and Paul McCartnet), &quot;Isn't It A Pity&quot; (Clapton and Billy Preston), &quot;Wah Wah&quot; (everyone) and &quot;Horse to Water&quot; (Sam Brown, who I am now madly in love with).<br />If you liked the Beatles you will love this concert and if you loved the Beatles this will make you ecstatic. In fact, if you never heard of the Beatles, and simply crave great music, this will be the concert you will watch a lot more than once.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|What good of a DVD collection without the film &quot;Scarface&quot;? Brian de Palma's 1983 bloody gangster flick with Al Pacino as the unforgettable character Tony Montana is one of my favorite films. The DVD should satisfy every &quot;Scarface&quot; junkie.<br />Tony Montana is a Cuban refugee who goes to tropical Miami with his pal Manny. Throughout the story he rises from a small-time punk to a major coccaine supplier. Wealth, power, and an ultimate stamp ground in Miami belongs to Montana. Soon his gangster fairy tale has turned upside down and he eventually dies in proud fashion. Pacino is absolutely amazing. The cast and script are also great. There are almost 300 cuss words in this film.<br />The DVD packs a wallop. It features documentaries on the origin of &quot;Scarface&quot; including the original 1932 version and the creation of the film. It also details how the filmmakers struggled to keep the film from having an 'X' rating. It also has a documentary that interviews the hip-hop nation and how the film revolutionized the industry. <br />Get the &quot;Scarface&quot; anniversary DVD or I'll &quot;bury you cockaroaches!!&quot;
0688163173|5.0|... This is a book that should be read by anyone that enjoys suspence, and themes that explore the darker sides of humanity.  If you enjoy a truely wild ride, then do yourself a favor and get a copy of this beautifully written Lehane thriller.<br />My first meeting with Lehane was in the form of &quot;Mystic River&quot;.  This was an absolutely fantastic book (which became a very disappointing film, thank goodness I read the book first or I would have missed out on a world of amazing literature).  From there I attacked all five of the McKenzie/Gennero novels, all of which are brilliant in their own way.  Next came Shutter Island. This is a book that I read twice in the same week.  As I closed the back cover of my hardback copy I closed my eyes and tried to piece together everything that I had discovered.  I read the book a second time, this time gaining much more clarity and seeing things that one CANNOT see upon the first read.  At the closing of the second reading, I still reread several sections and let it all sink into my imagination and understanding.<br />Wow, what a rush.  This book is not hard to undrestand, but it is IMPOSSIBLE to have forsight.  There are many directions this book could go, but the path that Lehane chooses is the only plausible and unpredictable path available.  In it's hash reality that is brutally described, the reader (this one anyway) is forced to deal with emotions and reactions to those emotions that might shock themselves.  How would I react to this or that??  Am I any different than Teddy or Chuck??  I asked myself this several times during the corse of the book as I thought about the amount of tragedy and suffering I could truely endure.  How do people cope with such devestation and suffering due to pain and utter loss??  Maybe the same way that Teddy does??  Perhaps.<br />In closing, IGNORE the press that tries to compare this fine book with other Lehane books.  Yes, it is different!  Yes, it is not Mystic River (perhaps better??!).  It is not the same as the five Mckenzie/Gennero classics (in this brilliant mans opinion). For that matter, why does it have to be.  STOP comparing and deal with it for what it is, BRILLIANT and ENTERTAINING! HOWEVER, it is an absolute thrill to read, and an epic canvas for a grand performance to be displayed.  As for the ending, NO COMMENT.  Enjoy the last paragraph for yourself, but don't cheat and skip to the end, YOU WON'T GET IT!  Enjoy yourself!<br />Read this book!  It will certainly be your loss if you don't!<br />Steve!).  It is not the same as the five Mckenzie/Gennero classics (in this brilliant mans opinion). For that matter, why does it have to be.

B000089RVX|1.0|I hardly know this band but my niece loves that stupid song &quot;Bring me to life.&quot; Every person who listens to this is must be a prissy 14-year old girl who can't seem to get a boyfriend by listening to this crap.

B000000LZV|5.0|I didn't hear this album until a few days ago, but for years I had heard the outpouring of critical raves bestowed upon this titanic 1984 magnum opus by San Pedro's Minutemen.  I finally purchased a vinyl copy, a move that I would recommend to anyone interested in this album, as the vinyl version containes 45 songs, while the CD version contains only 43...the CD is missing several stellar tunes, including the blistering Van Halen cover and \\"Mr. Robot's Holy Orders.\\"  To say the least, I was floored upon first listen.  Rock and punk bands just don't play with this sort of energy and conviction anymore.  Mike Watt alone is akin to the eight wonder of the world--his warbly, jazzily popping bass tone is enough to make anyone want to get up and dance whilst screaming some lyric like \\"forced-fed sifted tin can turn handle puppet!\\"  Watt's buddy D. Boon (rest in peace) shouts the band's obtuse, creative lyrics with a ferocious authenticity and a peerless attitude; so many political albums sound corny, but this one certainly does not, as every word that spills from Boon's mouth is pure magic.  Furthermore, he backs up every word with either a staccato riff or a burning solo, both of which make a case for Boon as the greatest indie guitarist of all-time.  Drummer George Hurley rounds out the lineup, adding his shotgunning drums and fluid cymbal crashes to the band's jazzcore sound--the end result is so energetic and bluesily frenzied that it makes Led Zeppelin sound like Sigur Ros.  While this sort of energy is rare, it is given even greater value by the fact that the Minutemen sustain it for *45* straight tracks (imagine the scene when the trio was recording these tunes in marathon sessions!).  There is not one shred of filler among these nearly 50 songs, and that is a near superhuman feat.  From \\"This Ain't No Picnic\\" to \\"Corona\\" to \\"History Lesson, Pt. 2\\" (the best song on the album), \\"Double Nickels on the Dime\\" is an album ridden with surpises, sharp virtuosity, and inconceivable consistency.
B000002L7J|2.0|I love the Smiths and have all of their albums but this CD is their worst!! Sounds like a poor or rushed effort.  All clickers save for How Soon Is Now.  I don't get all of the praises I'm reading.
B000092ZYX|2.0|Why any band would want to revisit the uber-boring, completely derivative and uninteresting moanscapes of &quot;Kid A&quot; is beyond me--but that's what Radiohead does here on the already vastly overrated &quot;Hail to the Thief.&quot;  This is mainly noodling guitar rock with few memorable melodies, but at least it replaces &quot;Kid A&quot;'s looped electric pianos with actual guitars.  To say the least, this album is a pale shadow of &quot;The Bends&quot;--the opening tune brings some excitement, but this energy soon dissipates into a sea of annoying paranoia and mumbled lyrics.  &quot;We Suck Young Blood&quot; is forgettable and tuneless, &quot;There There&quot; sounds like a poor man's Bjork crossed with The Cure, while &quot;Backdrifts&quot; is pedestrian, sub-Aphex Twin electronica.  I find it funny how Massive Attack's &quot;100th Window made all these same mistakes and somehow got slammed by critics, while &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; was hailed (pun intended) as one of the best albums of the year (and, in some critics' delusional minds, one of the best ever).  This is simply not one of Radiohead's best releases--get &quot;The Bends&quot; or &quot;OK Computer&quot; instead.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Wow. This DVD is amazing. Not only do you get the Two Towers movie, which is great in its own right (not to mention it's got added scenes) but there's also hours and hours of bonus footage about how they made the movies. For DVD's its a fabulous achievement. Good job, LOTR!

0393057658|5.0|I am not much of a baseball fan, but after reading a review of this book I was compelled to borrow a copy. The story is set against the backdrop of baseball, but it reads more like the solving of a great scientific mystery.<br />Anyone growing up in America, whether or not they even watch baseball, knows the basic stats that ballplayers are judged by: Batting average, RBIs, ERA and so forth. You can't escape them. And these are the numbers that make or break careers. Want to improve your team? Sell that .280 hitter and bring in a .295 hitter. Get a pitcher with a lower ERA, an so on. This was the received wisdom. To everyone but players of &quot;Rotissiere Baseball&quot;, that is.<br />&quot;Rotissiere Baseball&quot; is a paper-and-pencil version of the game popular with thousands of fans who trade players and play games based on the roll of the dice and statistics that they've compiled- statististics very different from the ones commonly reported. The players- many of them mathematicians, actuaries and others with a mind for numbers. These stats- termed &quot;sabermetrics&quot;- were empirically derived and then validated againt actual player performance. And yet they were completely ignored by the people who could most benifit from them- the owners and managers of the major league teams.<br />With one exception: The A's Billy Beane. An ex-player himself, Billy didn't have the math skills of those who compiled the sabermetric model, but he did have an uncommon amount of intelligence, and knew a good thing when he saw it. He used the sabermetric model to identify undervalued and overvalued players, and quickly traded his way to a top performing team with a relatively small budget.<br />Now that wasn't the only reason for the A's success, and Beane's skill went beyond just his utilization of the model, but it's the central issue in this story. The book isn't just about the math, of course; the portraits of Beane and the players he selects are every bit as fascinating. A good read for baseball fans, and a fascinating introduction to an arcane world for the math minded..

B00008BXJ6|5.0|The world's greatest rock band, AC/DC's first album, and it really is a great one. The songs on this CD are great! Of course, the most famous one would be &quot;T.N.T.&quot; Some of my other favorites are &quot;High Voltage&quot; and &quot;Rock 'n' Roll Singer&quot;. When you get this, read the letters on the back of the case, they're hilarious! The booklet also includes some great pictures of AC/DC during their first days. And, of course, a few tracks from the original Australian version of &quot;High Voltage&quot; do not appear on this album, such as &quot;Jailbreak&quot;. But, nevertheless, the CD rocks and definetly worth buying. Keep on rockin.
0684853523|4.0|This book is both entertainment (due to the autobiographical and anecdotal aspects) and instruction. Rarely have I encountered this combination with such honesty and passion. (The only other such book that comes to mind is Natalie Goldberg's &quot;Long Quiet Highway.&quot;) King answers the most common question, &quot;Wherever do you get all your ideas?&quot; once and for all, and also gives you such raw insight into his life that at times you feel like an intruder. I read parts of it over and over in hopes of memorizing the lessons. Highly recommended. (And you don't have to be Stephen King's biggest fan to aggree.)
B00005MAM2|3.0|I don't know what all the fuss is about when it comes to this movie.  It is so overrated, long and at some points very boring.  And yes I am an anime fan but this just didn't work for me.  When Tutsuo's body got huge and was ready to blow up that was when I thought the movie steered to far away from what the movie was supposed to be about.  Very strange movie indeed.  I recommend Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, Cowboy Bebop The Movie and Ghost in the Shell over this movie.
0451199871|4.0|Miss Marple is called to the home of her friend Dolly Bantry when a dead body is discovered in the library.  The body is that of a young girl and Dolly is afraid that her husband will be accused of the crime.  Miss Marple does some sleuthing, along with some professional investigators, and of course she comes up with the solution to the crime before they do.  All of the usual motives of love and money are involved and the solution is a typical complex web which is common to Agatha Christie's mysteries.  This book is not quite as ingenious as others in the series and moves at a somewhat slow pace, so it doesn't rate 5 stars, but it is a good read nevertheless.
B000001G7O|2.0|Mutter obviously put her heart in this performance but her upper tones are often shrill, steely and piercing. I have heard her art to much better effect elsewhere. The total disaster of this cd is Karajan's accompaniment. His old-age tendency to indulge in slow tempi might work well for Wagner operas and R.Strauss, but it is entirely inappropriate here, in one of Tchaikovsky's liveliest scores ever. Karajan might have imagined that his luxuriant tempi would enhance the beauty of this work. However, given the distanced, low-resonance live-recording venue the overall orchestral effect is very dry and irritating. You are always left wishing he'd hurry up and get on with the music --- which he never does, because the contents of this CD are permanent!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I asked my wife to give me this DVD set for Christmas. I missed the series completely when it aired, but I read an interview with Joss Whedon in which he said this was one of the best things he ever did and, knowing the quality of his work, I wanted to give it a try. I sat down on Sunday after Christmas and started watching the two-part pilot. My wife, who is not a big sci-fi fan, started watching about half way in. After it was over, she said, &quot;Let's watch another one.&quot; We watched two more. That night we started watching again about 9 and watched 'til 1:30 am. I can't think of any movie or TV series we have enjoyed more. There is a real sense of loss, however, when we think we may not get to follow these characters further into the future. If you love great characters, great stories, real humor and fabulous settings you cannot go wrong with Firefly. Give it to a friend...and that includes yourself.
B000084T18|5.0|I'm so tired of reading all of these reviews by people who think it's cool to dis the most popular rapper out right now.  This album is an instant classic.  It's right up there with Snoop's Doggystyle album and Dre's The Chronic album.  Every track on this CD is good.  I don't get tired of listening to it except the tracks that have already been played out on the radio (21 Questions, P.I.M.P., and In Da Club).  Give credit where credit is due.  He wouldn't be an 8x Platinum artist for no reason.  Just wait until the summertime, he's going to drop another instant classic!
B00005JMFR|3.0|The third and final installment of \\"The Matrix\\" trilogy finds Neo (Keanu Reeves) in a coma, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) in possession of a human body, and Zion counting the hours to total annihilation at the hands of the machines. After some action-packed efforts on the part of Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), and Seraph (Collin Chou) bring Neo back to consciousness, all attention is turned to saving Zion from impending doom. Niobe (Jada Pinkett-Smith), Morpheus, and the remaining captain and crew set off in one ship in hopes of reaching Zion in time to help fight the onslaught of the machines. Neo and Trinity set off in another ship for the machine city, where Neo believes he will find humanity's salvation and the purpose of his existence.<br />If you are expecting \\"Revolutions\\" to make sense of the many bizarre plot elements that were introduced in \\"Reloaded\\", you will be disappointed. If you are expecting a sound resolution to the problematic relationship between humans and machines that we first learned of in \\"The Matrix\\", you won't get that either. Oddly, the fate of greater humanity, the humans living in the Matrix, has been abandoned entirely.<br />\\"Revolutions\\" is heavier on action than \\"Reloaded\\". -Literally heavy. This is a movie about heavy artillery. And it works better than \\"Reloaded\\" on that level. \\"Revolutions\\" suffers from the same mediocrity in cinematography, costumes, and music as \\"Reloaded\\" did. And I think the makeup is actually bad. We notice these things because the first movie excelled in these areas, as well as in many others. The film is sometimes bogged down by annoyingly verbose computer programs. (Why is it that whenever artificial life forms are featured in science fiction they have diarrhea of the mouth?) And the Wachowski Brothers  have now officially joined George Lucas and James Cameron as big budget action directors who can't write dialogue but insist on doing it anyway. The dialogue is insufferable. But I don't detect as much sloppy editing or plain poor judgment in \\"Revolutions\\" as there was in \\"Reloaded\\". And where \\"Reloaded\\" suffered from having no real villain, \\"Revolutions\\" has happily restored Agent Smith to nemesis status. Unfortunately, like its predecessor, \\"Revolutions\\" elicits laughs in all the wrong places. Once again, the fight sequences fall flat. But they are better integrated into the plot than they were in \\"Reloaded\\". (To see in a nutshell the vast difference in quality between this movie and the original, compare the gun battle at the entrance to the Frenchman's club to the lobby scene in \\"The Matrix\\". The latter was energetic and beautiful. \\"Revolutions\\" version is dismal, grotesque, and over-produced.) But  overall \\"Revolutions\\" is a slightly better film than \\"Reloaded\\" was. It is better constructed and, although all semblance of thoughtfulness has been abandoned, it works better as a straight action film than \\"Reloaded\\". The extended battle for Zion has some exciting moments, and I wasn't actually bored at any point during the film.<br />After seeing \\"Reloaded\\", I got the impression that \\"The Matrix\\" trilogy had been conceived in two parts, but the second part had been stretched into two movies with the addition of a lot of filler material. Having seen \\"Revolutions\\", I  still have this impression. But go see how the story ends. \\"The Matrix: Revolutions\\" is an entertaining shoot 'em up, but just isn't much beyond that.I don't detect as much sloppy editing or plain poor judgment in \\"Revolutions\\" as there was in \\"Reloaded\\".

B000099T2L|3.0|This album features some of the stranger tracks ever done by Missy Elliott (\\"Signs,\\" or the \\"I was in love with [cough] Jay-Z [cough] a Sagittarius, and he was also an Aries, Taurus, Pisces, and everything between the previous two signs\\" song) and Jay-Z (the horrible \\"Crazy in Love\\" and \\"That's How You Like It\\"--thank God for The Black Album) The best tracks to me are \\"Be with You\\" through \\"Yes\\" and \\"Speechless.\\"  The upbeat beginning is too bombastic and sounds like a failed version of any experimental album ever created from Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band to Speakerboxx/The Love Below.  The latter songs are sappy ballads.  Thematically, it's Survivor all over again, without \\"I-think-I-can-sing\\" Michelle and Kelly (who can do better than Simply Deep).
B000001ED1|5.0|This album is simply a wonder. It contains a few great songs and several more good ones. Joan Osbourne's voice is miraculously good on every cut. The instrumentation and backup musicians are also fantastic. If you don't have it, buy it right now!

Me Against The Music is the best, Madonna adds a lot to it. Boom Boom is very catchy and makes you wanna get up and dance, so is Outrageous. And her next single Toxic is definitely one of my favorites. Even Britney haters are saying they like Toxic once they hear it a few times. So definitely give this awesome album a chance!
0714843377|4.0|This is a very inspiring book for open-minded people. If you do not believe in yourself and don't want to listen to anyone who tells you how great you REALLY are, do not waste the money.<br />If you do - you'll find plenty of common sense gems in this book (like &quot;If you get stuck, draw with a different pen&quot;). One can say: &quot;If they are common sense, why do I need this book - I have enough of common sense myself?&quot;. Sure you do. That is why you are where you are, right? :-) Pick up this book to remind yourself about what you know and get inspired about what is possible.<br />Some people complained that the title is very self-promotional. It is. And that is the point of the book and the title: &quot;It's Not How Good You Are, &quot; (let's say it refers to the reality of sales of the book) &quot;It Is How Good You Want To Be: The World's Best Selling Book by Paul Arden&quot; (it wants to be very good - it wants to be the world's best-selling book).<br />Who knows - it might just as well become one...
073930464X|1.0|I am a huge Jonathan Kellerman fan - have read everything but this new book is just incredibly boring. The language is very self indulgent and where plot shoud be, there are just endless descriptions of people or events that don't really relate to the story. The only thing worse is the reader of the audio - flat, dull, the story may be putting him to sleep and his &quot;female&quot; character voice is just terrible. I was also offended by the need to use stereo type descriptions of Asian characters in the book. Very unusual and I'm so disappointed.
B00005AACC|4.0|This is an action film and the main interest is the action itself. The point is that it is well built, entertaining and extremely credible which makes the action all the more acceptable. The acting is also extremely good with a brilliant Tom Cruise. But the film has some depth, some real depth. We are speaking here of terrorism, but the type that comes from global criminals. They are white, European or American, and they only aim at making a lot of money by forcing some not-too-ethical businessmen spit out much money under the pressure of some blackmail, though this blackmail leads these businessmen to making even more money than they are forced to spit out. A « gentleman's agreement » in a way. This type of crime, of terrorism is common and frequent, but most of the time unknown and even well hidden. The topic of the film is even more uptodate than we may imagine. A pharmaceutical firm invents a killing germ and the drug that can stop it. The objective is quite obviously to release the germ into the public in order to sell the drug. But a criminal gets his hands on both the germ and the drug and then can blackmail the businessman. This denunciation of pharmaceutical firms is not unique and it plays on the fear among the public that some new disease should appear and kill millions of people. We know about AIDS. We know about the SRAS. We know about Mad Cow disease. But do we know everything ? That is particularly frightening, though the film tries to reassure us by showing some people who fight against this, even to the death if necessary. A disquieting film anyway.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
B000089RVX|3.0|I put this song on my list for christmas or my birthday. I had heard the first two tracks, Going Under and Bring Me to Life, and really wanted to hear what the CD had to offer. However, when I did get the CD, I was fairly disappointed. I didn't realize the male singer from Bring Me to Life was a guest singer, and the mood of singing from Going Under was unique. The main problem I have with this CD is that it focuses mainly on the singing. Now, if you would buy a CD just for a good singer (I wouldn't; I need the music with it too) you could buy this CD. If you have some spare money and have heard some of their music, buy this CD. However, if you expect lots of hit songs like Bring Me to Life, you can pretty much consider yourself dissappointed. Most of the songs sound the same, with Amy singing clear above all the music (the one thing I don't like, also the fact that she sings very very very high). If they had brought her voice down a bit like in Going Under, this would have been a great CD. It's still good, but not great.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|Rufus Wainwright's music is NOT accessible. I say this first because if you want pop candy to listen to mindlessly while you're working out, check out Mandy Moore or Britney Spears. Wainwright's music is like a fine old brandy--some people may not enjoy it, but true connisseurs know its worth.<br /><br />This album is the composer's most brilliant of his three. Of his albums, Poses is the easiest to like. This one is the hardest, but most worth the effort. His lyrics are pure poetry, simply because of their simplicity and, for cynics, their triteness. His lush orchestration is genius--but better than that are his words. For example, some reviewers dislike &quot;Vibrate&quot; but its understated beauty and simple lyrics are what make it so gorgeous. Wainwright communicates hopeless longing and unrequited love without ever saying the words! Its Carmen-like pizzicato and lulling melody add to the meaning of the words. Oy vey. This song in itself is worth buying the cd.<br /><br />That said, every song on this record is a gem worth unearthing. Track 1 is optimistic, show-tuney wonder. It's musical prozac. Track 5 should be played along with track 7--&quot;Pretty things--so what if I like pretty things?&quot; Simple, almost trite lyrics, but when you listen to them, they touch a chord in you that you weren't sure even existed. Track 9 is a love song to the mysterious Natasha, but even it is not cliched. &quot;Do you know how scary this is for you and is for me?&quot;<br /><br />Buy this cd. Listen to it more than once. It may take awhile, but if you can be touched by music, this cd will move you.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina does awesome on this CD.  I really like &quot;Walk Away&quot; which has a bluesy feel to it and has great piano in it.  &quot;Fighter&quot; is my favorite song because it shows off her voice well and It makes me want to jump up and cheer!  The interlude &quot;Primer&quot; is quite beautiful, I'd like to hear her sing en espanol some time. I love the spanish feel of &quot;Make Over&quot;!<br />I bought this CD for &quot;Beautiful&quot; and I would buy this CD for that song alone if I had to. It's heartfelt and glorious and I love it.  I sing it over and over and when I really start thinking about it, it can make me cry.  But this CD, has so many great songs on it I didn't just get one good song out of the deal.  You need to buy this CD!
B000060MMI|5.0|This band rocks! One of my friends let me borrow this cd and possibly burn my own copy. At first I really wasn't sure I'd like it. The first song was kinda weird but when the second song came on I started humming along. The best song on this cd has to be &quot;Rebels of the sacred heart&quot; it's really amazing. I would love to see these guys in concert.
B0000035E7|5.0|This album has got this low quality background buzz. I guess that should be an imperfection, but with Nirvana.. its one of the most attractive features of this album... could that noise be a Love Buzz?
0385507755|5.0|&quot;A Million Little Pieces&quot; is not about a likeable person. It doesn't try to be. It is a true and honest account of an addict's life. For that reason, it is incredible. Books that deal accurately about the life of an addict are rarely about a happy person being raised by Mary Poppins. People who turn to drugs and alcohol are looking to fill a void in their life, and thus as people obviously are flawed. &quot;A Million Little Pieces&quot; is an incredibly written and incredibly accurate book by an addict about being an addict. I put it in the same league as Rikki Lee Travolta's tragically beautiful &quot;My Fractured Life,&quot; Augusten Burrough's brilliant &quot;Running With Scissors,&quot; and Jim Carroll's ode of self-destruction &quot;The Basketball Diaries.&quot; To hold its own in that list speaks volumes on the caliber of this book. I strongly recommend it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I tried to find the time to catch Firefly when it was on Fox, but only once did I manage to tune in and since I had no background on the characters or situations I found it silly. Since starting from the beginning with the DVD set, I've become a fan. It's part Star Trek, part Wild Wild West.  The writing is brilliant, the acting great and, simply put, it's the best thing I've seen on our TV in a while. Now I want more episodes -- can't wait for the movie!
0385512104|5.0|The use of a semi-autistic central character (Christopher Boone) is a brave step by \\" The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" author Mark Haddon. The bravery is not in using an autistic child as a character or even main character, but in not making the story about Christopher's disabilities, but rather how the story is uniquely colored by being viewed through the eyes of someone with such challenges. The result is both dramatic and bitterly funny (but by no means making autism take the brunt of the humor, it is not the ... of the jokes but rather the colorful voice in which the humor is relayed). There is a playful musical quality to the writing; the type captured by authors like Augusten Burroughs in \\"Dry\\" and \\"Running With Scissors,\\" Rikki Lee Travolta in \\"My Fractured Life,\\" and Jonathan Lethem in \\"Fortress of Solitude.\\" There is a sureness to Haddon's writing that is impressive and decisive. I strongly recommend this book.
0385504209|5.0|This was one of the best books I've ever read. Art, history, action, thrills, and super writing.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Anyone who has ears, let them hear.  Anyone who has a brain, let them buy this CD.  DO NOT listen to the insipid ramblings of the idiot that calls himself &quot;carosato2 from Davenport, Iowa, USA&quot;.  Don't bother to read his &quot;review&quot;.  Just know that this CD is some of the best music Elvis Presley (or ANYONE ELSE for that matter) has ever put on tape.  Like Elvis or not, his  influence in music - not just Rock - CAN NOT be dismissed.  He was a true innovator - PERIOD.  The sound on this CD is superior to any other release (by Presley) by BMG.  This d1ck &quot;carosato2 from Davenport, Iowa, USA&quot; should know that this is a forum to discuss the MUSIC AND THE CD of the individual - not a place to attack someone that you do not like.  I'm not crazy about 50 cent at all.  But because I don't like his style of music does not mean that the man does not have talent.  carosato2 from Davenport, Iowa, USA - do us all a favor and do your reviews like you used to - in the stall at your local rest area.  That is where your ramblings belong.
B000002U8G|5.0|Ok, my opinion on &quot;Meddle&quot; is it's a great peice from Pink Floyd. From the incredible &quot;One Of These Days&quot; to the opus &quot;Echoes&quot; Which has gotten a new nod with the recent &quot;Hit's&quot; collection. My dogs love &quot;Seamus&quot;! <br />Now to what I don't get in people like the last reviewer. Comments like :You are not a Pink Floyd fan at all if you don't love this album&quot; I am sorry. You don't need to  love EVERYTHING by a band or artist to make you a fan! Everyone has different tastes and thank God for that or someone like Mr. Roger Waters wouldn't be so unique! To add insult to injury by adding &quot;Not wanting to sound like a fanatic...&quot;, looks like ya already did. It reminds me of Trekkies who love every episode of Star Trek. There is good with bad in everything. I love reading people's alternate opinion. That's what makes this forum so great. I also don't agree with this album should have been called &quot;Intro to Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; It is a fine peice all on it's own without being attached to an album released 2 years later. I would be disappointed if &quot;Obscured By Clouds&quot; didn't get released. Which came out in between &quot;Meddle and &quot;Dark Side..&quot; My review in a nut shell: If you are a fan of Pink Floyd's unpredicible genius. You will love &quot;Meddle&quot;!
B0000DC13U|1.0|I am a huge fan of the late 60s and early 70s era Stones. I bought this DVD without knowing anything about the French director Jean-Luc Godard. The so called &quot;pop politiacal cartoons&quot; that the review on the back cover refers to as sheer genius, are moronic and actually painful to watch. These skits are all about socialism, black power, and revolution. Oh boy! The high minded symbolism of this movie just looks ridiculous to me. The skits in this movie are so un-professional that they appear to be made by Junior High School kids! And that is a slight to the kids! As far as the Stones rehersals, they are interesting, but slow. They develop only the one song. As great as that song is (one of my all time favorite Stones tunes) it's just not something to watch over and over again. Especially if you have to endure the rest of this horrible movie.
B0000AOV85|5.0|First off, let me say I love these \\"Classic Album\\" DVD's! They are so informative and I love hearing the master tape going through the board while different tracks are pointed out and enjoyed. This disc is every \\"Dark Side Of Tne Moon\\" fan's dream come true. For these reviewers that put down this DVD by saying \\"Phoey, no live stuff!\\" I usually read the package before I buy something. Since you can't do that with Amazon or other online stores, these reviews are great. No where did it say this was a live concert. The \\"Classic Album\\" series has been around for some time now so if you don't want to chance your hard earned 15 bucks (yikes, haha)on something, maybe it's worth finding out what you are getting! <BR>  Other great \\"Classic Album\\" DVD's are \\"The Who- Who's Next\\", \\"Elton John- Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\", \\"Fleetwood Mac- Rumors\\" just to name a few. I have quite a few of them and love them all.  A real treat for musicians and fans alike!
B000068PQ0|5.0|I listen to this album on an almost daily basis. I had the opportunity to watch these guys in Toronto at the SARSfest and I was awed with Fight Test and Do You Realize. It was terrific, this album is awesome, and if you play guitar, these are some fun songs to play. Fight Test's melodic riff and Yoshimi's swagger rock. Buy it, and you rock.
B0000C8AVX|5.0|Bringing it All Back Home is regarded as the transitional work where Bob Plugged-In, went ELECTRIC, and became more than just an acoustic folkie.  The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan is THE ESSENTIAL DYLAN Album, however, the words and music on Bringing it All Back Home are Bob's BEST BY FAR!  Even Bob has said, \\"I look back at a number of songs on Bringing it All Back Home and I still don't know where a lot of those images came from?\\"  Sure, he \\"expanded\\" his mind a bit during parts of this recording session, but as he said, \\"that's not where many of the lyrics came from during this set.\\"  I'd say these remarkable songs and lyrics were the result of a more self-assured Dylan, who had the confidence to break free from his folkie persona in order to see what his words and music would do in a less restrictive setting.   Whatever, the case may be, Bob never released a recording that is as consistently brilliant, eclectic, entertaining, and absolutely stunning as Bringing it All Back Home!  <BR>He starts this TOUR DE FORCE out with Subterranean Homesick Blues, which he delivers a jaunty and non-stop narrative that both amuses and entrances the listener.  This song is still in a class by itself, and nobody has even come close to writing something like it!  <BR>The second song, She Belongs To Me, is a slower and more introspective tune, which lures the listener into it, in a relaxing manner with its rich and luxurious texture.     <BR>The third cut is the wonderful Maggie's Farm, and this infectious and joyful romp manages to get the listeners attention, for it's Bob at his acerbic best!<BR>Love Minus Zero/No Limit is another slower and more reflective ballad, where the fantastic orchestration backing Bob, manages to fill out the song in a understated and extremely tasteful manner.<BR>Outlaw Blues, is a basic and rustic blues stomp which hooks the listener into following Bob on one of his unusual and rewarding journeys. <BR>On the Road Again is a hilarious, upbeat tune, where Bobdraws a picture of A VERY STRANGE AND DYSFUNCTIONAL HOUSEHOLD, and some person wants him to join them in this environment, but BOB rebuffs all of their advances, THEN he chides them for NOT LEAVING SUCH A BIZARRE SCENE!<BR>The last song on side one is Bob Dylan's 115th Dream, where a very \\"loose\\" Dylan begins TAKE-ONE with a burst of uncontrollable laughter, he recovers quickly, says TAKE-TWO, then launches into a NON-STOP, incredibly entertaining, SIX AND ONE-HALF MINUTE surreal ramble, and he doesn't miss a beat as he spins a yarn about a \\"THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS\\" type of adventure, where the Dylan character just bounces from one farce to another.  The song ends with Bob crossing the path of Columbus who's sailing into America, as BOB'S SAILING AWAY FROM that \\"STRANGE LAND,\\" and Bob wishes him GOOD LUCK!  That's it for Side One, also known as the \\"so called\\" AMPED-UP Dylan, and I find it hard to believe that some people actually thought Bob had \\"diminished\\" his standing by adding a few musicians to this set, for THE WORDS AND MUSIC ARE SO INVENTIVE, FRESH, BRILLIANT, ENTERTAINING, and THOUGHT PROVOKING, that I CANNOT IMAGINE after anybody listened to such AN OUTSTANDING group of songs, they still felt Bob wasn't living up(sic) to his potential???   <br />Oh well, SIDE-TWO IS ALL ACOUSTIC DYLAN, and it's SO UTTERLY FANTASTIC, that any DYLAN \\"PURIST\\" would have forgiven(sic) Bob for Side-One!  I'd say, that HANDS DOWN, this is THE GREATEST SIDE OF MUSIC BOB has ever recorded.  If anybody questions the genius of Bob Dylan, then make them listen to this side of Bringing It All Back Home, and if that doesn't change their mind, well, then their mind likely isn't in the right place?<BR>Song One is Mr. Tambourine Man, its elegant and ethereal imagery has not lost any luster, and this remarkable tune justifiably belongs in the pantheon of all-time great works.<BR>Gates of Eden is the second cut, and Bob uses accented phrasing to embed the words of this powerful and moving song, more deeply into the listener's consciousness!<BR>The Third Song on SIDE-TWO is IT'S ALRIGHT MA, (I'm Only Bleeding), and in my opinion THIS IS BOB'S MOST IMPRESSIVE WORK.  The observations are razor sharp, the images are timeless, the meanings are even more relevant, it's relentless, yet not forced, powerful but not overbearing, it evokes anger and sorrow, it provokes thought but still allows enough leeway for the listener to take that thought and develop it further by themselves, not to mention that THIS SONG NEVER GETS OLD OR STALE!  Look up the lyrics, I guarantee you that they'll \\"stir up\\" your emotions, and they'll make YOU THINK ABOUT PEOPLE who have made situations even worse because of their own limited vision and character.  Bob, was in some kind of zone when he unleashed this ASTOUNDING STATEMENT about our SOCIETY, and it has NO WEAKNESSES!<BR>The last song on Side-Two is It's ALL OVER NOW, BABY BLUE, and this is also one of Bob's strongest, insightful, and most powerful works.  Side-Two is comprised of Mr. Tambourine Man, Gates of Eden, It's Alright Ma, (I'm Only Bleeding,\\" and It's All Over Now, Baby Blue; THAT IS OBVIOUSLY THE GREATEST SIDE OF MUSIC WHICH BOB EVER RECORDED.  Side-One is also flawless, and although THE FREEWHEELIN' BOB DYLAN is THE ESSENTIAL BOB DYLAN RECORDING, the caliber of MUSIC AND LYRICS on that recording are remedial compared to THE WORK ON BRINGING IT ALL BACK HOME!  In fact, I think Highway 61 and Blonde on Blonde are a bit overrated, for the top two Dylan recordings on my list are THE FREEWHEELIN' BOB DYLAN AND BRINGING IT ALL BACK HOME....I'll PUT THOSE TWO DYLAN RECORDINGS AGAINST any of the other wonderful recordings Bob has made, for there's not a weak cut on them, yet they're loaded with his strongest material!  Bringing It All Back Home is one of the finest American Recordings of ALL-TIME, and every time I listen to it, I'm grateful that some Jewish kid from Minnesota who didn't have much of a singing voice, wasso determined that he made his VOICE HEARD, and that WE CAN STILL LISTEN TO THAT VOICE because what he said was too GOOD TO IGNORE!  Thanks Bob, I appreciate your fine work, and I find it  to be very inspirational!
B000007T1M|5.0|This the best cd I have ever listened to! If you like hard rock and/or metal there is no doubt that you will love this cd. It's so good, I'm listening to it right now!!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never caught Firefly on television.  I don't watch a lot of TV.  When my wife rented the series on DVD, I thought it would be a fun way to spend the weekend.<br />Turned out to be one of the best shows I've ever seen.  The other reviews have described it, so I am just adding my voice to the chorus.<br />About half-way through I realized what it meant for this show to be prematurely cancelled and I was genuinely sad.  I pray the movie flies.  Who knows?  Maybe some executive will see the movie and say, &quot;This would make a great series.&quot;
B000084T18|5.0|I love how everyone thinks they're cool dissing the &quot;popular&quot; thing.
B0000028MA|4.0|When this cd was released, it was more than a great soundtrack to a cool movie, it also served as an instant &quot;Best Of Grunge&quot; collection. It's true there's no &quot;Nirvana&quot;, but when you listen to what IS here, I'm sure you'll find yourself in a state of bliss. Included are songs from &quot;Alice In Chains&quot;, &quot;Soundgarden&quot;, &quot;Mudhoney&quot;, &quot;Screaming Trees&quot;, and two from &quot;Pearl Jam&quot;. Plus epics from &quot;Mother Love Bone&quot;, and &quot;Smashing Pumpkins&quot;. Also there's excellent non-grunge from &quot;Paul Westerberg&quot;, &quot;Jimi Hendrix&quot;, and &quot;Lovemongers&quot;, (Heart). It's really just a great collection of killer music. The only way it could have been any better, is if it was packaged in flannel.
B0000TB050|5.0|We are 20+ years into the careers of U2,but this concert is U2 at their best.The definitive statement from a band in their prime.The performance in general is stellar,but the vocals from both Bono and the Edge leaves me breathless.Bono,s performance is understated,yet still,emotionally charged and powerful.I've watched this several times,and the initial charge that I got is still there.Intelligent camerawork and editing,along with reference quality sound,punctuate this performance.From the exploding opening bars of Elevation,through a mindblowing Bullet the blue sky,and finally Walk on,this concert never lets up.These guys craft hits in the studio,but the true experience with U2 is Live!If you only buy one,this is it!
B0000028UK|4.0|Truth be known, I never really got into &quot;Ten&quot; that much. It was good, but so incredibly overplayed by everyone at the time, I still never need to hear &quot;Jeremy&quot; again. This cd however, really impressed me, and it remained my favorite &quot;Pearl Jam&quot; album until I heard &quot;Yield&quot;. It still has that early &quot;PJ&quot; sound, yet you could see where they would be going on the next couple albums. &quot;Go&quot;, &quot;Animal&quot;, and &quot;Dissident&quot; are big grunge rockers, while &quot;Daughter&quot; and &quot;Elderly Woman Behind The Counter In A Small Town&quot; show their range. &quot;Rearviewmirror&quot; and &quot;Indifference&quot; are excellent as well. Overall it's a great album, and showed that they would be around awhile. Nice cover too.
0446677450|5.0|I am grateful to Robert T. Kiyosaki for sharing these gems of wisdom that his Rich Dad shared with him. They are simple, but also powerful gems of wisdom. It is uncommon knowledge. <br />Common knowledge has you believe turn your money over to a stockbroker and have him/her watch it for you because they are the only ones that can manage your money. FACT: Stockbrokers on average sell you the hot stock of the day. They make their money on commissions irregardless if you make a profit or not.<br />Common knowledge has you believe that to buy a home you need to go again through a broker and only get financing through a bank. FACT: You don't need a broker and you don't need financing via bank. There are still plenty of assumable mortgages available and other forms of owner financing programs.<BR>There are also plenty of foreclosures and consequently, plenty of people who need help from a competent and caring real estate investor who can save their [the person about to go into foreclosure] credit. You think banks or brokers really care about your credit? Think again. <br />I also like the fact that Kiyosaki points out that a house is not a asset (unless you are a bank or broker) A house eats you alive.<br />Kiyosaki is also right on about your employer. As Kiyosaki's Rich Dad told him, being in the E-Quadrant is the wrong quadrant for your sake.<br />Rich Dad Poor Dad is a life changing book. The only person attacking this great book is someone that nobody has ever heard of, has no record to speak of other than he sometimes has a tabloid-like website that is usually down more than it is up and has had similiar websites on other &quot;guru's&quot; that have been shut down. Interesting is that the more this guy posts, the more books Kiyosaki sells. Keep posting...Kiyosaki loves you!<br />I am grateful to Kiyosaki and his Rich Dad for sharing this simplistic but powerful information.
B000002H97|5.0|Metallica's sixth studio album, &quot;Metallica,&quot; is in my opinion incredible. It is nicknamed &quot;The Black Album&quot; for its jet black cover. This is the third studio album featuring bassist Jason Newsted, who replaced Cliff Burton after he died in a tragic bus crash. The black album is one of their more popular albums, with such radio hits as &quot;Enter Sandman,&quot; &quot;Sad But True,&quot; &quot;Unforgiven,&quot; and the ballad &quot;Nothing Else Matters.&quot; The album takes you trough a journey, beginning on the energetic &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; and ending on the heavy, fast-paced riffing and almost rap like vocals of &quot;Struggle Within.&quot; The cd kicks off with \\"Enter Sandman,\\" a song with lyrics about nightmares and things that go bump in the night. This isn't a very good song in my opinion, good, but not enough for me to particularly like. The second track, \\"Sad But True\\" dishes out lyrics dealing with the bad side in every human being, and possesses two solos and a guitar themed interlude, not to mention a huge, heavy, crushing verse riff. Great song. Next is the relentless \\"Holier Than Thou,\\" offering lyrics and gossip and rumors. The song is very rough and Jason's bass can be heard very well. Not great, but good. \\"The Unforgiven\\" is ballad like song, offering lyrics possibly about not enjoying life to the max. The song is great, not to mention an incredible solo. My only complaint is the solo should be way longer. \\"Wherever I May Roam\\" is another great song. Relatively slow tempo, but good. It offers up lyrics about being on the road constantly. \\"Don't Tread On Me\\" is another favorite, featuring very catchy melodies and riffs. \\"Through the Never,\\" though not great, delivers nice riffs. Next is the famous ballad, \\"Nothing Else Matters.\\" Though it is considered to be a message to the fans, it was originally a very emotional song about a loved one, by James Hetfield. The band happened to overhear him playing it and forced him to put iton the album. I guess I am not the only one who thinks this was for the best. \\"Of Wolf and Man\\" begins with a pounding riff, developing into a great song. \\"The God That Failed\\" is not a favorite, but still a great song, with a catchy verse and lyrics about James' mother's death. His mother was a Christian scientist and refused medical attention believing God would heal her. God `failed,' thus inducing a song. \\"My Friend of Misery\\" is a definite favorite. IT offers up great riffing and a melodic approach. The cd ends on a strong note, with the fast-paced and almost rap like \\"Struggle Within.\\" This cd has brought great enjoyment to me and I would encourage you to look into it. I hope this review was helpful. Ah, doesn't matter as long as you didn't think it totally sucked.

B0000C6E4D|3.0|It is so problematic to follow early success, because the weatlh of material and experience you build leading to your first CD is so great. And so Sarah's angst, pleading, soulful sincereity that rang from her early work is now growing faint.<br />The result is an honest effort that is falling short. Ths album is packaged and sanitized, lacking in depth and vision. Its not exactly Muzak, but it also not the Sarah we know and love...
B00003CXAA|5.0|The Godfather Trilogy DVD collection is one of the greatest movie pictures in Hollywood history.The Godfather Part 1 was epic film made by Francis Ford Coppola, the screenplay by Coppola and Mario Puzo(author of the book)was perfect. I thought that Al Pacino deserved Best Supporting Actor in this picture. The Godfather Part 2 was a great followup to the first telling two stories, the power of Michael Corleone and the rise of Vito Corleone, Al Pacino definitely deserved Best Actor at the Oscars but he was robbed. The Godfather Part 3 was pretty good not as great as the two previous but still a great story by Coppola and Puzo to end The Godfather.
0385504209|3.0|After watching the Da Vinci Code flying off the shelves of the bookstore I work at, I figured I might as well give it a try myself.  It was better than I expected--which isn't necessarily saying much--but overall a perfectly ordinary thriller.  The book's mindfull of a lot of Michael Crighton's work: obvious indication of meticulous research, fast-moving plot, but written with an eye for the big screen, leaving some of the settings, and more grieviously the characters, somewhat threadbare.<br />But so what?  It's a quick read and entertaining, and while the plot itself is forgotten almost as qickly as the final page is turned, some of the ideas the novel plays with linger on.  The nature of PHI, the existance of Opus Dai, the Priory de Sion, and the exploration of Da Vinci's works--it's all great stuff and fun to read.  Some of the grail conjectures are dubious at best, but again, so what?  Most texts about the subject are equally goofy.<br />My biggest complain with the novel is a glaring error in the research that comes early in the novel and proves surprisingly important later on.  The apple.  Though modern tradition has it that humanity was booted from Eden for Eve's munching of the apple, it remains exactly that, a modern interpretation.  The Bible refers only to a fruit, not an apple, and earlier interpretations of the scene have substituted other fruits--like a pear, for example.  Which seems like nit-picking, but wouldn't a world-reknown symbologist know this?  So much for suspension of disbelief.
B000000WFZ|5.0|This soundtrack was given to me as a gift. I had never seen the movie previously but when i started playing it the music just flowed around me and i honestly started tearing! No music has ever touched me like this has. It is so dear to my heart that i actually used Gabriel's Oboe for my processional when i got married. I highly recommend this music to anyone. It will move you.
B00009XITP|2.0|I admit that once you start this movie you won`t want to stop, and that the extra features are good, but this seems too fake! Like what are the odds of you having a father who`s running for whatever in England, and is marrying a money-hunter, and never knew about you???<BR> I think that if you watch this you`ll agree with me that Byne`s has done much better than this!
B00009TB5G|4.0|Well done movie, but Frodo's struggle and other emotional elements drag on too long.
0316096199|4.0|Lucky is an amazing book.  Although it was difficult for me to read about a young woman's rape, I thought it was extremely interesting.  The fact that it was a true story and she had the strength to write about it and tell the whole world just made her a greater author.  The book sends out a strong message to females that have been victims of rape.  <BR> The book had a very strong beginning and a very shocking but interesting ending. The book had only one problem, it was too detailed especially during the prosecution of the rape trial.  I couldn't understand the defense that the prosecution lawyer was trying to make.   I am also currently trying to find out if the rape of Alice's friend (Lila) was linked with Alice's rape and the person who assaulted Alice.   <BR>Overall the book was definitely worth reading.  The book gives rape victims a sign of hope and courage, which will help them go on with life.  I strongly recommend this book for men because I want all males to think twice before forcing sex on any female.  When someone says no to sex and the other person violates it, it's called RAPE.
B00000IMTG|4.0|For all you old school 70's rockers, add this to the collection. Like many of the great rock and roll bands, live is best. Good keyboard sounds on the live which is not as clear on studio Rainbow. Some feedback sounds during recording. Great Blackmore and Coverdale for thin air guitar and dashboard drummers.
0151008116|4.0|I think that \\"The Life of Pi\\" was an extroadinary book in so many ways.  It gives the reader a spark of life, while restoring hope and faith in yourself and the strength and will of the human soul.  It also touches on various religions: Muslim, Hinduism, and Christianity, creating an insight and deeper understandanding for the premise of faith.  Now, the only reason I did not give this book 5 stars is due to the author failing to deliver upon his promise: that he can tell a story to make you truly believe in God or god (whichever you prefer).  That he does not do.  Yes, it is an extraordinary story with circumstances I cannot even fathom, but it did not, disappointingly, make me believe in God any more or any less than I already did. I think that was a bold statement on the authors part--to make such a promise-- when i finished the book, i found myself a little disappointed...
1556154844|5.0|As the other reviewers have overwhelmingly suggested, this is a solid book.  It dives into sufficient detail, but doesn't bog the reader down with useless technicalities.  This book is readable and well organized, making it a great reference or learning manual, which are two entities that very rarely exist together.  It provides examples to illustrate the respective topics and includes an exhaustive bibliography for those who crave something extra.  <br />This book is a good buy.
B00004WGC4|5.0|For anyone who has never seen a Faulty episode. I urge you to rent it and will garuntee that you will purchase the complete collection afterwards.  One of my all time favorites is The Germans with Cleases famous imitation of Hitler and The corpse.  When a guest dies and the hotel and other guests believe it to be a murder case.  A word of caution : Only watch one episode at a time or your sides will burst from laughing.  I only wish that  he would have made a movie out of it. Listening to his ideas on the DVD sounded like it would have been a hit if he had done it.
B000002IAS|5.0|I would have to agree the CD falls short of the LP, which I had stolen in '89.<br />Can either compare to the concert? Do they do it justice?<br />Between 1969 and the closing of the Fillmore West I think I saw so many great bands that many I've forgotten. Tower of Power, It's A Beautiful Day, Joy of Cooking, Hot Tuna, were all local bands that could really boogie. Incoming was Fleetwood Mac while Pete Greenwood was still playing, the Allman Bros, (all of them) Doc Watson over at the Buddhi in Berkely, but the concert I remember most was Delaney &amp; Bonnie going until the early morning hours, loving what they were doing and seemingly willing to play until we all got old and gray. &quot;I Don't Want to Discuss It,&quot; and &quot;Come Out In My Kitchen&quot; blew me away that night. The only comparable performance I've seen in my life was a very old Texas farmer named Mance Lipscomb (Gotta be the inspiration for John Hammond)at the first Woodie Guthrie Folk Festival at Lincoln Park in Oklahoma City.<br />If you like Delta Blues, (and I surely do) and your collection includes people like Mississippi John Hurt, and Robert Johnson, you are going to love what Delaney &amp; Bonnie do with it, but then if you own a Robert Johnson you already know that :)

068483605X|5.0|Watership Down is one of those books that leave an indelible impression upon the reader years after reading it. Yet when I re-read it again this past week, I was struck again with fresh wonder at the timelessness of the tale. Watership Down centers upon the extraordinary lives of a motley crew of rabbits. The cast of characters is unforgettable, from the clever and resourceful Hazel, the strong and stouthearted Bigwig, the story-spinning Dandelion, the jocular Bluebell, and the mystical Fiver.<br />The beautifully wrought prose of Richard Adams reads like poetry at times. He makes the fantastic exploits of the rabbits seem utterly believable. He draws you into their world with masterful craftsmanship, and you can almost actually see, hear and smell the sights, sounds and smells that the rabbits do.<br />One delightful feature of Watership Down are the tales of the cunning trickster hero El-ahrairah, who has many adventures with his faithful sidekick Rabscuttle. When Dandelion tells the tales of El-ahrairah, one gets a deeper insight into the world of the rabbits by hearing their mythology.<br />Another tool that Adams uses to draw you into this wondrous world is the creation of rabbit language called 'Lapine'. Rabbit feeding is known as silflay. Moonrise is called fu Inle. Enemies are known as elil. A fox is a homba and more than one fox is hombil. Motorized vehicles, such as cars or trains, are known as hrududu. Paralyzing fear is called 'going tharn'. After a while, reading the Lapine vocabulary becomes almost second nature, but (at least in the hardback version I read) there is a Lapine glossary at the back of the book to help if you forget the meanings of any of the words.<br />I have not seen the animated adaptation of this book, and I'm a little reluctant to do so, as I worry that it will not live up to what I would expect from a book of this caliber. Watership Down is truly a treasure and I highly recommend it to anyone. Despite the fantastic premise of talking animals, the novel exudes an almost tangible sense of realism. It has more realism than a whimsical book such as The Wind in the Willows. There is trickery and treachery, violence and war, and yes even death at times. But the story can still be enjoyed the young of all ages.<br />~Sly
B00005JL78|2.0|Rent if you must but don't waste your money on buying this one. The story is lame. Special effects are sooo unrealistic.<br />Very disappointed.
B00006AW2G|3.0|\\"Let It Bleed\\" absolutely contains some of the Stones' absolutely best music. \\"Gimme Shelter,\\" the title track, and \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" are tremendous. The question is, do you want to buy a Rolling Stones album to get the songs that aren't on greatest hits packages that you already own? (If you don't have any in your collection, you should consider them first.)<br /><br />\\"Midnight Rambler,\\" \\"Love in Vain,\\" and \\"Live with Me\\" appear on the live album, \\"Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out.\\" \\"Midnight\\" is better live (that version appears on the \\"Hot Rocks\\" collection), \\"Love\\" is better in the studio; \\"Live\\" is fun for anticipating the sound of \\"Sticky Fingers\\" and \\"Exile on Main Street,\\" but it's rather unremarkable on any album.<br /><br />The remaining songs are mediocre enough to call \\"filler.\\" \\"You Got the Silver\\" and \\"Country Honk\\" indulge in the group's infatuation with Gram Parsons, but they're so-so songs. \\"Honk\\" is fun for being a camped up \\"Honky Tonk Woman,\\" but it's as unnecessary as the Beatles \\"Revolution #1.\\" \\"Monkey Man\\" is a mediocre composition that isn't helped by Jagger's screamed vocals at the end.<br /><br />I recommend that you buy \\"Let It Bleed\\" only if you're determined to own all of the Stones' material of this era.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Wow, do I miss this show. I miss the brilliant writing, the astonishing special effects, the nuanced performances from the cast. I miss the perfectly-realized world the characters inhabit, the little details of design and dialogue that make it feel so three-dimensional and give it such depth. I miss Kaylee's cheerfulness, and Simon's awkwardness, and Zoe's casual badassery, and Mal's tightpants. Oh, do I miss the tightpants. I miss Serenity, and Persephone, and Niska's skyplex. I miss Saffron and Jubal Early. I miss setting up the VCR on Friday nights, but that's okay, because the DVDs are much better-quality. I miss wondering about Book's past and River's future, and I really, really miss hoping that next week there'd be a new episode that would explain things. I miss Wash's dinosaurs. <br />Mostly, I miss having this show on the air. But at least I have it on DVD, so I can see what I'm missing in widescreen.
B00009W0U4|5.0|This art-house film manages to dredge up some of most ghastly taboo elements in society and renders them in livid upsets onto the screen. In Cannes, during its world premiere, critics called this the most controversial movie ever to be screened at the festival. There are good reasons for this. Firstly, it was obvious after the closing credits that this film would probably bypass the banning treatment in most countries. Secondly, the performances came from credible actors and actresses who obviously took the film very seriously and worked hard to make their characters functional. This makes it all more the terrible that the world will see France's Hollywood counterparts do the equivalent of participating in an adventure into the decrepit bowels of human waste.<br />The theme of Irreversible is a rape revenge movie. It contains the most shocking murder scene ever committed to celluloid and the most heinous sexual one too. This will unfairly lop this drama alongside the likes of \\"I Spit on your Grave\\" or \\"Last House on the Left\\". \\"Last House on the Left\\" is not as bad as \\"I Spit on your Grave\\" but is equally controversial for its rape sequence. \\"Last House\\" is shocking, but is passable because it has the moral elements of \\"eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth\\" to consider. \\"I Spit on your Grave\\" is exploitation that is designed to cater for the gore market and has no place in cinema. Most horror fans will also agree that \\"I spit on your Grave\\" is simply sick and should never be repeated again. Some may even consider it dangerous material. I certainly would agree with that last statement and I hoped that a film like that would never be made again. Then Gasper Noe came along in 2002 and appeared to have done just that. When the censors let this one pass and it achieved some acclaim from the critics it got my attention.<br />Irreversible is like neither of the two movies mention above. It is hard to compare Irreversible to anything other than that of very moving, shocking and brutal drama. The film is designed backwards, running from the end to the beginning. This helps the viewer to come down from the bad trip that first forty minutes bangs into them. The film is also edited in such a way that it moves uncut from one scene to the next. This is achieved by a very nauseating camera movement which goes up into the air and flips around in circles to join up with the next sequence. This stomach-churning effect will have you feeling ill within the first five minutes. As Noe takes us into the red lit nadir of a homosexual nightclub you are about to see things that you have never seen before... nor do you want too. When the freak murder scene involving a fire extinguisher comes out of the blue, you are witnessing what seems like a very real and violent homicide. The camera does not cut away as a person appears to have his face smashed in to the point where all that remains is the lower quivering jaw and his arms shaking around. The question then remains as to why this happened, who is the dead man and why did they kill him? As the film moves backwards, you hope that is all is going to be explained and in many ways it is.<br />The resolution or justification never really comes but you realize that what has happened, transpired because it simply did - without cause, without validation but not without meaning. Noe's world is as much of a fantasy as it is a reality. There is nothing here that is going to reconcile what you witnessed and the film is pretty bleak through and through. It has many morals about the intention and execution of vigilante retribution but also about the desperateness of a lovers' sheer blind rage. Many things happen in this film because the protagonists did not take a moment out to consider their actions or the consequences. In many ways this film speaks volumes about the quality of life and those who disrespect it. It describes a world where bad guys can win and good people become victims. Sounds familiar? That is becauseit is. There is no happy Hollywood ending here because we do not live in Hollywood. Noe smacks that home to us and maybe some us have a need to be told this. Certainly I came away from this movie with a changed mind in a lot of respects. I want to live my life for the better and certainly want to avoid becoming or ending up like most of the characters here. In many ways this is a good thing and the film genuinely makes you want to value life, friends and love a bit more. It is strange that the nature of this movie would have this kind of effect - but it does.<br />The moral here is that life is precious. You should think about yourself and others a bit more and try to do more good than harm. Sometimes our pride and greed can sideline these things. Certainly Noe is saying that we should remember who and what we are and try to make a world for the better. It is certainly a worldly endeavour to get people to understand this and Noe's last reel contains a final vestibule of assertion which drives this point home to the viewer. It is a wicked way to present this just cause, but then again sometimes it is needed. It is strange that this film would have this paradox but then again Noe is a great director and his understanding of how we work is second to none. This is cinema at its most powerful, dramatic and engaging. Do not avoid this because of its offensiveness. There is a good moral message here to be gained.e it is.

B000002A46|1.0|...no depth at all in this CD. Mariah has no &quot;angel&quot; at all. Ridiculous CD. Don't get it.
B00009ATIX|1.0|I must admit I am more than a bit biased here because I am a Tarkovsky fan. When I heard that Hollywood wanted to do the remake I just fell clean out of my chair. Then I managed to see this thing, although I did not want to, and I must say that although I would have given it a little bit of credit for maybe trying an alternative take on Stanislaw Lem's book of the same name, this one just ends up being not that engaging with an uneventful plot that does not even try. You can cook this one up anyway you want but this is just plain bad.<br />Clooney walks circles around every other actor here and gives it all he has got. Seeing him going crazy, breaking away piece by piece, was fantastic but the film is really not that inspired and ends up looking like a 2001 ripoff (including the DVD cover).<br />The metaphysics behind the story are messed up in the worst possible way. Somewhere along the line the director just gave up and decided that the love story was what this film was about and the metaphysics where just pointless to engage in. So he is left doing this thing about Clooney trying to establish if being with a space ghost that looks and feels like his wife is the same thing as being with his wife and ponders over this again and again and again... until you just snooze away into your hybernation chamber wanting to wake up when Clooney draws his conclusion... which is like 76 Billion light years away at the rate this film moves along.<br />It is amazing that although the director tried to get back to Lem's grass roots and away from Tarkovsky that he still made garbage out of it. The film may *look* good but that only lasts so long. Producer James Cameron was obviously absent from the whole thing, still in Titanic na-na-land, until the distributors put it out. There is nothing here to even remotely suggest that the talent wanted anything less than to get it over and done with and the hell out of the studio so that they could get on with their lives. To be honest they should have just burnt the negatives and cut their losses. This one is not something good to have on your CV - or for anyone to see it for that matter either.<br />This film did not break the bank, but it did do a number of things. Darren Aronofsky lost his production funds for \\"The Fountain\\" because Hollywood was afraid that it would bomb like this one. I think that it was terrible that Hollywood would do that to such a talent like Aronofsky based on this over-rated director's botch up job.<br />Sadly this is just more proof that some gems should be left alone. Why try to fix what is not broken?should have just burnt the negatives and cut their losses.

0345452577|4.0|In his new novel, the second published in 2003, author Jonathan Kellerman starts fresh and creates an enigmatic plot surrounding a brutal serial killer. Kellerman is familiar to many mystery buffs for his psychologist hero, Alex Delaware, who works as a police consultant in a 17-book series. He's tried different threads before, most notably in 1988. Kellerman's strong ties to Judaism sometimes shine through in his novels, but are not featured, as is the case in wife Faye Kellerman's writings. Religious faith does not play a role in this newest book, but Kellerman keeps it rooted in something he knows much about, psychology.<br />Jeremy Carrier is a hospital psychologist. He's still trying to find his way back into the life he once led, after his girlfriend, nurse Jocelyn Banks, has been brutally murdered. While stumbling through his days, he is befriended by well-known Dr. Arthur Chess, a pathologist old enough to have retired from the hospital, who is sort of an emeritus on hospital committees. Jeremy's initially puzzled by Chess' interest in him.<br />Chess is Jeremy's entree into a secret society of oldsters who are all stars in their own professions, and retired. It takes most of the book for Jeremy to determine what ties them together in &quot;conspiracy&quot; and how he fits it the scheme of things.<br />When Chess goes traveling, a series of enigmatic clues to other murders, similar to Jocelyn's, begin to disturb Jeremy's days. He can't help but wonder what role Chess plays in the mystery. In a parallel plot, Jeremy meets an interesting new love in resident Angela Rios. Between his relationship with her, and his willingness to be drawn into the murder mystery, Jeremy finds himself putting his own life on the line. In addition to an engrossing plot, Kellerman has created a young practitioner with feeling towards his patients and signifcant skill in making a difference.<br />Some Kellerman-like touches (Carrier drives an old Nova; shades of Delaware's vintage Cadillac! Carrier, instead of being enlisted by police detectives to help solve the murders, is actually a viable suspect, but ends up assisting the police.)are present, and you have a nice, tight tale of homicide with a surprise villain and the possiblity of a new series. In particular, the colorful members of the &quot;Conspiracy Club&quot; could be utilized in future books.<br />It seems as though, judging from other reviews, that many of Kellerman's loyalists disagree with my rating.<br />Most probably it is because they just wanted another instalment in Delaware's continuing saga, since the last three books in the series (&quot;Flesh and Blood&quot;, the excellent &quot;The Murder Book&quot; and &quot;A Cold Heart&quot;) have revived the series from the total drek that Kellerman created in books 10-14. I think many readers gave up on him during that spate. By contrast, I'm intrigued by the fact that he's given the reader a viable alternative to his older series, and hope he continues to revisit Jeremy Carrier in future work.<br />Nice work!ge Cadillac!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought the Firefly DVD in hopes that it would be good. I had never seen it before, but I was trusting that if Joss could do amazing in 2 shows, then he could produce a 3rd that was even half up to par of Buffy and Angel. Trust me, if it was even half as good as Buffy or Angel I would have loved it. That's how much I adore those two shows.<br />Immidiately, I was blown away. Thank god I threw away 40 bucks to buy it without ever seeing it. The cast is all amazing, the CGI looks incredibly real, besides the obvious space CGI stuff, I heard in a commentary that there was a shot with a bunch of cows, and the cows looked so real I had no idea. <br />The DVD is a must-see for fans. It even has 3 unaired episodes (which are all special and wonderful. Trash and The Message are especially amazing, in every way possible.) Joss and Tim really spread their wings with making this show, and it's a shame that Fox ... yet again cancelled an amazing show, (Dark Angel, Family Guy) and plagues the TV with crap reality TV shows. They did not do the show justice.<br />Still, I was enthrawled. Everything about the show was amazing. It easily matches up to the standards, if not exceeds the standards of Buffy and Angel. Firefly did in 15 episodes what it took a good couple of seasons of Buffy to do, and that was to have every episode be awesome even if the plot was shotty, the witty dialouge and the acting could hold it through.<br />I can't wait to see what the movie does, and maybe Fox will come around and decide to put the show on air again. I can't even imagine what Joss could have done with this amazing show. I can't even imagine.<br />Plus it has all these little extra goodies which I love, including a nice little easter egg of Adam Baldwin singing &quot;The Hero of Canton,&quot; which is downright hilarious.<br />Easily worth 40 bucks.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|The original album had always been in my mind a tragedy.  Not because the songs were not good, but because you couldn't quite hear the greatness that the Beatles were in the album, but knew it was there somewhere.  Now we finally get the raw version of the album, and in my mind it is at least twice as enjoyable.  It now ranks as one of my favorite Beatles records, right up there with Abbey Road and Revolver.  (Before it was one of my least favorites, despite my favorite song, Let it Be.)  The only complaint is that I hoped for a bit more on the bonus disc.  Perhaps a few never before released songs.  All in all a great album though.

B00004W52U|5.0|My jaw dropped when I read a negative review of this cd. First a concession: fine, the sound quality isn't great, but it IS passable to the point that its easy to forget that the cd wasn't recorded in a digital vacuum. Thats the only flaw I find with the album. Otherwise I thought the vocals were original and energetic and the guitar melodied well, with a few shining moments like on the track Bad Sign. The bass and drums are outstanding, complex and technically challenging but not overpowering. Most outstanding is the passion that the entire band plays with, there isn't a boring song on the whole album. This is an outstanding cd, and I would definitely recommend buying it. If the person reading this is a Rancid fan and a complete sound system nerd, this album is a must have.

B000001IQH|5.0|Without being melodramatic, this cd defined punk in the '90s. Everyone draws influence from the speed and energy of this album. From its crunchy guitar riffs to its complex bassline, proficient drumming to the raunchy vocals and scathing message about the way the world is, this cd rocks. I'd recommend this cd to everyone from clash to fifty cent fans. Go, buy it, its good.

B000065U6O|5.0|Regardless of the theme and propaganda aspect, Triump of the Will is one of the most important movies ever filmed.  It documents the 6th Reich Party Congress that was held in Nuremburg in 1934, and subsequently was awarded the Gold Medal in Venice in 1935, and the Gold Medal at the World Exhibition in Paris in 1937.  The crowning glory for Leni Riefenstahl, with the defeat of the Nazis in 1945, her association with the movie and several other Nazi propaganda films nearly destroyed.  Up until her death in September 2003, at the age of 101, she vehemently downplayed her association with the Nazis, and attempted to rebuild her reputation through still photography.  The nature of her involvement with the Nazis will never be fully known, so it can never be known for certain whether this film was, as Riefenstahl claims, a compromise so that she could continue to exercise her creativity.  Whatever the case, Triump of the Will is an important movie, both in terms of its influence on cinematography, and as a historical document.  It is a definite must-see for anyone who wants to understand the Nazis, as it epitomizes the regime's skilled use of propaganda to gain and maintain power.
B00005O5CM|5.0|Reese Witherspoon shines in this movie. It's a great girl-power flick (in truth, one of the best pure chick flicks out there).<br />Witherspoon plays Elle Woods, a blonde CULA student (president of her sorority and homecoming queen, too) who gets dumped by her boyfriend Warner, who is heading off to Harvard Law school next year. He says he wants to break up with her, because she's not &quot;serious&quot; enough for him. As Warner puts it, his family expects a lot of him (he comes from a line of country-clubbing senators) and he needs a &quot;Jackie, not a Marilyn&quot;. <br />So Elle doesn't get mad, she decides to apply to get into Harvard! She has a few doubters, but she insists she can do it, as she has a 4.0 and ends up scoring a 179 in her LSATS. Go Elle! When she makes it to Harvard, Elle is--very much so, at first--discriminated against as a blonde (and especially for the way she dresses, looks and acts) she still tries to be nice to everyone. I really admired that about her. <br />I recommend this movie a lot!
B00005JLPK|4.0|I was quite impressed by Salma Hayek's single-minded determination to get this film produced in the face of heavy competition from others. She felt destined to play Frida Kahlo, and the film was a labor of love that is evident in every frame. Kahlo's bold and colorful paintings are heavily autobiographical, and so it is unavoidable that the film takes us on a journey through her life and work all at once. As we see events in Kahlo's turbulent life unfold, we automatically understand the content of the artist's paintings as they are presented to us.<br />Hayek also found probably the ideal director in Julie Taymor, who has quickly established herself as one of the most visually gifted filmmakers in the industry. Taymor's handling of the actors is first-rate, as she brings spirited performances from the entire cast. Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is equally excellent, with lots of dazzling camera tricks and numerous painting-like shots. The film also benefits from terrific lighting effects, makeup, set design, vibrant costumes, and an outstanding, Oscar-winning score.<br />I was also pleasantly surprised by the film's opening scene, which turns out to be a very clever and unconventional way of introducing Kahlo to the audience ... but you'll just have to see the film to know what that means.<br />My only criticism with the film, and a minor one, is that the pace is almost breathless, and so the film feels more compact than it really should. It almost always rushes like a river when sometimes it should flow more gently.<br />This film clearly belongs to Salma Hayek, and she occupies the role so enormously that it's hard to imagine anyone else taking on the character of Frida Kahlo with as much verve. It's nothing short of a career-defining performance, and her Oscar nomination was well earned. My earnest hope is that Hayek will find equal inspiration in the years to come, because the movie industry needs the kind of passion and resolution she brought to this project.
0156012197|5.0|Having been given this book by a friend who was leaving to return home to live in Australia, i was somewhat suprised at what looked like a childrens book being proferred as a good-bye present. This soon changed. The story is a gentle tale, dealing with perceptions and friendship, loss and hope. Everyone who reads this book seems to take something different from it, be it adults or children. Katherine Woods's translation is the only one i have read, but i feel compelled to draw parallels to the Paulo Coelho book, The Alchemist, in that it is without doubt an inspirational read
B0000AQS6R|1.0|I can't believe this.  Folks, if you haven't bought the (cough, cough) &quot;Special Edition&quot; of this movie yet, don't waste your money.  Seriously.  If you are really curious about it, rent it and see for yourself.<br />The only &quot;special&quot; feature is one commentary.  And it is truly the worst commentary I've ever heard on a DVD.  For one thing, too many people are doing it, and Chevy isn't even one of them.  They are all talking over each other, and they are talking about the DUMBEST things.  <br />D'Angelo keeps rattling on about her hair.  Who cares??!!  You can tell right away that D'Angelo REALLY likes to hear herself talk.  Oh, and did anyone catch the special ornament that came with the DVD?  It's garbage.  It's made of some kind of foam, or something.  Unbelievable.<br />I'm going to sell this thing on eBay, and keep my original DVD version until something respectable comes out - if that happens.<br />Don't get me wrong, I LOVE this movie.  I watch it a dozen times every Christmas, and I laugh every time.  I adore it.  But I am just seriously disappointed in this joke of a &quot;special edition.&quot;<br />:-(

0671015206|4.0|I think the book does a great job at telling you how to become a millionaire.  Problem is, the book focuses too much on advocating extreme money hoarding.  What do i mean?  Well, the way i see it, there are 3 approaches to dealing with savings/retirement:  1. complete neglect (saving little or nothing).  2.  Saving and accumulating in moderation (recommended 10%).  3.  Saving as much as possible, and living to max frugality (what this book advocates).<br />I'm not sure the author(s) realize you cant take your money with you when you die.  The book acknowledges most of their identified millionairres are 50 or older (probably 60+).  How sad is it to think that you have to live like a poor-man until you're a dried up ole prune?  Also, what about those people that love their jobs and would work anyway, thus dont really need millions in the bank by the time they are 50.  <br />I'm not so pessimistic as to think I migh lose my job tomorrow.  Even if i did, I'm pro-active, and would find another job within weeks.<br />Bottom line is this:  I think most everyone's &quot;real&quot; goal in life is to maximize their enjoyment of life as much as possible.  If you ask me, the best way to do that is live off of 90% of what you make, which is close to your real worth, enjoying the finer things of life during your prime years (provided 90% is a nice chunk of change :-) ) while having a more than adequate retirement by the time you reach 59-65ish.  <br />Dont fall for these advocates of deprivation that wont end until your either old or dead.  Whether you're religious or not, trust me, you cant take it with you.<br />Azanon

B00005JMJ4|4.0|This is a charming and subtle tale of a twenty something woman and a middle-aged film star who happen to cross paths while visiting Japan. John Harris (Bill Murray) has been given a lucrative sponsorship deal, promoting a Japanese whiskey, and is confronted by a few cultural barriers, mainly language, which he handles in obvious and hilarious ways. One of the funniest scenes in the picture is his two-minute stint on a cross trainer machine that runs out if his control. This is run of the mill slapstick humour at its best, pulled off in that familiar Murray style, which even now, when I think of it, brings tears to my eyes. In fact, this really is the only piece of slapstick in the entire film, because what makes this picture special is the subtle dialogue between the two main characters. There's no over acting in this film, but an understated realism and tasteful honesty, which to my mind, should bring a few industry awards to first time director, Sofia Coppola.<br />Bill Murrey has come a long way over the last twenty years or so. He is one of the world's most funny comedians, with his own unique signature, and has finally reached a point in his craft, where doing a `serious' role will not upset his many fans. He tried this early on in his career, playing the role of Larry, in the second film adaptation of Somerset Maugham's, `The Razors Edge'. Tyron Power played in the original and, of course, this was an impossible act to follow. We did not take him seriously back then, ironically, his performance was superb. In the role of John Harris, the character demanded a particular charm, sophistication and worldliness along with an attitude of self-deprecating humour, which Murrey captured brilliantly, revealing a man at the top of his form. Scarlett Johansson also commanded a fine performance as the lonely and abandoned, Charlotte - her close ups encapsulating every emotion and nuance in each and every scene. She managed to connect with Murrey and display a maturity of character that could not have been done any better. The camera simply fell in love with her face.<br />This is an enchanting piece of filmmaking about two normal people, lonely and in a strange country, who in any other circumstance, would more than likely not take a second glance at one another, but cross paths and discover and form a connection, and perhaps, something a lot more.  Four and a half stars.character that could not have been done any better.

B0000DD7LB|1.0|I used to be a Britney fan until I heard this C.D.  For one, it sounds just like all of her other music except with better beats.  But other than that...this C.D. is just not worth buying.  I bought it and listened to it about 5 times and now its getting dusty on my C.D. rack.  It seems as if she has something to prove on this C.D. by talking about sex and partying and drinking.  That's fine and all but a whole album based on those 3 things....gets kind of old.  We know you've grown up but do you have to talk about it on every single song?  Her voice sounds very diluted with all the beats in the background which is  pretty much all she has going for her.  This album is a cry for acceptance as an artist when all it seems to be is another Britney Inc. album...showcasing her lack of talent and artistry.  The only song that I think is worth listening to is Toxic...but once again, its the beat thats catchy not her voice.
B0000029GA|5.0|simply put: this cd is a classic. it is one of the few you can play without having to skip a track.  i rank this cd up there with jay's &quot;reasonable doubt&quot;, big's &quot;ready to die&quot;, and dre's &quot;the chronic&quot;.  this is one of the most underrated albums ever produced.  any true hip hop fan must have it.

0156027321|4.0|Life of Pi was a great read. I enjoyed the surprising perspectives and metaphors used to move the story forward. There are many great reviews here-I agree with many of them. I'd like to add that it is a book that can be enjoyed both by religious and nonreligious readers due to its fine writing, depth, enjoyable narration, and practical information about what really goes on in a zoo! It is not a heavy philosophical work, and shouldn't be read as such. If you are expecting an entertaining apologetic for the existence of God, look elsewhere. Just enjoy Martel's storytelling for what it is...a unique narration with just enough twists and surprises to keep you interested.
B0000E64TR|5.0|1973-bell bottoms are still all the rage but, hey, if you want to really dress up you can wear your jeans suit. Ziggy make have captured more critical attention and, sadly, The Beatles are dead. The Rolling Stones have ended a string of classic albums and now are producing a stream of vapid junk filled records.<br />Elton John ruled the airwaves in 1973 and although this wasn't my first EJ purchase (Honky Chateau), it came to be one of my favorite albums. Like most 2 record (or CD sets), there is some filler but even the filler is better than 3/4s of the stuff other artists were releasing at the time. Within a couple of years, Elton will also reach a low in his recording career (Part Time Love or A Single Man anyone?).<br />From the stunning opener Funeral For a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding to the last original album track Harmony (supplemented by 3 b-sides recorded/written for the album but rejected plus a stripped down version of Candle in the Wind with just Elton and acoustic guitar), this SACD literally reinvented a great album for me. The only draw back is that the 5.1 mix sounds quite a bit different in some cases than the original stereo mix in terms of dominant instruments, etc. Luckily, the SACD is backwards compatible and can be played on most CD players.<br />Even the stereo version of the album sounds sharper, with greater clarity and better definition. It replaced my Mobile Sound Fidelity version in the CD player. This latest edition restores the single B-Sides released with Goodbye Yellow Brick Road and Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting to their rightful place. Screw You is also where it rightfully belongs although it doesn't quite fit the rest of the album. I've read some complaints about the stripped down version of Candle in the Wind. I actually like it. I wasn't a big fan of the rewrite John and Taupon did for Princess Di nor did I like the live version released as a single about a decade ago. This, though, is like listening to an early run through of the song. Everything is stripped from the original master multitracks except acoustic guitar and Elton's voice. Which makes me wonder; what happened to all those demos made for the album all those years ago? I'd love to hear an early demo of Saturday, Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding. That would have truly made this an absolutely essential reissue. Still, it's hard to argue with the sound quality.<br />On a few CD players if you try to fast forward through tracks or during start up you might get an error message. You'll either have to restart the SACD or turn the power off and on again. It's not a problem with all players but I noticed it was a particular issue with my car CD player.<br />Haven't purchased any of the other hybrid discs yet (aside from DVD-Audio which does have the disadvantage of not being able to play it in simple stereo if you've got a 5.1 DVD player)but did get a sampler with Rolling Stone in December. Almost everything on it sounds great, too although I have heard that the SACD of Tommy is murkier and not a huge improvement over the 1996 CD.h of the song.

0140157352|1.0|&quot;Getting to Yes&quot; has many good tidbits of information, but nothing life changing or ground breaking.  The information is primarily common sense.

B000089QEN|5.0|Andrew Davies is a very clever man with, I suspect, quite a tender heart.  I don't know how he draws out these old novels for us the way he does, but he's done it again here. I have to admit, the first time I saw this production, I liked it, but was left a little cold.  The second time I saw it, I knew it was just me, and that it takes a viewer accustomed to mediocrity some time to readjust to this kind of brilliance.  The costumes and sets, in the hot Oriental colours of the real Regency instead of the too often misrendered pastels of the earlier Georgians, are well done and the acting and casting are great.  Davies, cleverly, put some of the wry observations of the narrative passages into the mouths of the characters. &quot;I must say, Dr. Hume, if a man's character is to be abused, there's nobody like a relation to do the business.&quot;  David Bradley is old Sir Pitt is himself, in fact, the whole Queen's Crawley contingent will make you both laugh and squirm, just like they're supposed to.  Janine Duvitski as marvelous as the ghastly, grasping Mrs. Bute Crawley.  Natasha Little is luminously beautiful as Becky Sharp, her careless curls at unsettling contrast with her little smirk. Amelia Sedley is so wet you could ring her out (Thackeray predicted my criticism of her character, by the way) but Frances Grey plays her so well you admire her, as you do all of them, for just being the flawed creatures they are. <br />You will find the inhabitants of this fair very much alive and not at all like puppets, as Thackeray disingenuously tells you they are all through his book.  The visuals well support the spirit of the production.  There is one scene of Dobbin and Osbourne conversing outside their barracks, and the camera then raises into an extreme high shot that makes them look exactly like toy soldiers or pictures on a chocolate box.  It's the shot often used to film a football game or the square formations of the old battlefields, so we are reminded that what becamealmost quaint in the ensuing two hundred years was once very real. The battlefield scenes are up close and personal, noisy and ugly, from the grim patience of the Dobbins and Osbournes, the foot soldiers who carried the terrible day of the Battle of Waterloo, to the hard breathing and slamming together of metal and flesh as the cavalry engages.  <br />The score has disturbed some people, but it's as brilliant as the adaptation and delivers the feel of the period directly. It's hard to say why it works, but there's no question that it does, and anachronism only serves as a friend, here.  Like Becky's wonderful, new remarks, which I'm sure she really made, &quot;Baisez mon cul.&quot; and &quot;I'm sorry I'm laughing, your ladyship, but I just can't help it.&quot;  When I actually saw the band at Vauxhall Gardens, they provided me my bearings, like finding a &quot;You Are Here&quot; on a map. The songs are placed perfectly.  When Becky's entertaining at home, her occasional flat notes don't seem to be noticed by the men in her thrall, and Becky similiarly winning over the gyneocracy with her &quot;Dido's Lament&quot; (sans the flat notes) at the Steyne House soiree is not to be missed.  <br />The story itself, whatever it's about, whether it's just a puppet show or one of the most profound, tender observations of human life ever put to paper, is delivered faithfully, without sentiment, but with more of the buried tenderness of the author than he would ever own up to. The ending, where these inhabitants of Vanity Fair learn to recover from glamorous war and get on with the business of becoming unexciting Victorians, and where a mysterious bad girl is saved by the intervention of a cheeky, innocent little boy is delivered in this production in all its beauty.  But never mind that.  As it was not about pastel interiors, the real Regency was not about sentimentality.  Somebody said that all authors are in love with their childhood.  Even though this was the work of a Victorian, born in 1811, and even if he did not properly approve of her, I think Thackeray was in love with his wicked, plucky little heroine, as he was in love with the period in which she flourished.  Perhaps he is the curious little boy walking up the casino steps into the past and into that strange world of what appear to be grown-up people with their masks and secrets.  When he gets there, he finds this particular grownup needs him.  In fact, it's almost as if she's waiting for him to let him know she is not so strong on her own, and to remember her and to please be sure to write about her.  We certainly need Andrew Davies and his adaptations.  See what you think of this one.  You won't be disappointed, and if you are, watch it again.
1582432678|5.0|I'd never heard of Lionel Shriver, but of all the fictional interpretations of Columbine that I've read, this was by far the best. It's tough, complex, weird, vivid, and frightening and I could not put it down. The narrator is far from likeable -- she's beyond unreliable -- and yet I ended up really liking and feeling for her. A vain, selfish woman to begin with, she's completely devastated by what her son becomes. And even that monstrous son -- Shriver makes him human and (somewhat) sympathetic. What a feat. I can not recommend this book highly enough.
B0000C1733|4.0|A Chili Peppers greatest hits album could have been so great, given that they are quite possibly the best band of the last 20 years.  However, this cd isn't a true portrayal of their greatest songs, nor does it represent their whole career.

B0000666DW|5.0|i might have reviewed this cd before, but i dont remember, so here we go.<br />first off let me say that mastodon is the most amazing metal band in the relapse assault.  yes, although hard to believe, these guys top out cephalic carnage, dillinger escape plan, and maybe even pig destroyer.<br />i guess the reason that makes this cd so great is that its so diverse, while relapse is my favorite record label, a lot of relapse bands release CDs while are wonderful, become very dull after a couple of listens due to lack of variety in the music. mastodon is NOTHING like this however, they can have the all out brutality such as the opener &quot;crusher destroyer&quot; or &quot;burning man&quot;, and than can slow down a touch with songs such as &quot;trilobite&quot; and the instrumentals of &quot;o'le nessie&quot;. <br />these guys are just flat out talented. everything you hear about brann dailor's drumming is true. he's so technical and quick that a lot of the time your so focused on listening to the drums that you miss the rest of the cd, its that good. but, the beauty of his drumming is that he isn't always bursting on speed and going all over the kit like flo of cryptopsy, dailor likes to keep pace with the music, while still plowing his own path. believe everything you hear, the drums sound amazing.<br />the guitars are no exception, either.  the music varies over several genres, and every single song stands out, no song sounds the same, this is what makes mastodon so much different from other relapse groups.<br />the vocals are also pretty well done, they are ridiculously low (such as nile) to where you can't take them seriously, and it isnt even really a growl, they sound like much more of a low yell, pretty neat. but dont be looking for a ton of vocals on this disc, for the music is what carries mastodon, a lot of the songs feature long instrumental interludes, with a dash of screaming.<br />1. Crusher Destroyer (9/10) - great opener, only 2 minutes and some really frantic drumming, heavy and somewhat repetitive guitar riffs. <BR>2. March of the Fire Ants (10/10) - heaviest song on the cd, period, and argubly the best on the disc. i cant say much more about it, just flat out amazing.<BR>3. Where Strides the Behemoth (9/10) - fast paced, and of course the crazy drumming make this a great song.<BR>4. Workhorse (9/10) - a little bit slower paced and not as heavy as the first 3 tracks, but it has a sick breakdown near the end, not the best on the cd, but still a great song.<BR>5. O'le Nessie (9/10) - starts out slow, with some cool guitars, and then just slams you with heavy riffs and screams, one of the longer songs on the cd.<BR>6. Burning Man (10/10) - this is where mastodon shows off their blazing speed, this one's a quickie, and just flat out kicks.<BR>7. Trainwreck (9/10) - this is the slowest song on the cd, opens with some voices and trains in the background, and a very soft guitar, than kicks into the first singing effort found on the disc, but dont worry, it picks up on the heaviness near the end. i really enjoyed this song.<BR>8. Trampled Under Hoof (9/10) - very similar to crusher destroyer and burning man, quick, frantic drumming, and a really catchy opening guitar riff, good song.<BR>9. Trilobite (10/10) - has the soft melody of trainwreck, and the all out heaviness of march of the fire ants, all in all a beautifully brutal song that shows a slower side of mastodon.<BR>10. Mother Puncher (9/10) - Similar to march of the fire ants, but it stands out in its own way, some catchy guitar riffs and just flat out heavy guitars, great song.<BR>11. Elephant Man (10/10) - instrumental piece, very beautiful and one of the few instrumentals that i can listen to over and over again, from ANY band that ive listened to, simply amazing, great closer for a fantastic CD.<br />i know i gave no song below a 9, thats because EVERY SONG IS AMAZING. believe everything, you will NOT be dissapointed with this, every single thing about thiscd is great. the music, the vocals, the production, EVERYTHING. by far the best relapse release EVER, GET IT NOW!

It was only a few minutes long considering that this was probably the second most commercial album they've sold (right next to Cryptic Writings). The songs here are perfect for a veteran or any hardcore Megadeth fan or a beginner. Not as epic as their early stuff, but this is definitely worth your cash.The only letdown of the album is the length.<br />It starts with the brutal drum solo of the underrated &quot;Skin O' My Teeth&quot;. The lyrcal and musical content here is beautiful.<BR>It ends with an epic classic Megadeth tune &quot;Ashes In Your Mouth&quot;.<br />The Best songs here are:<BR>1)Skin O' My Teeth (a great opener)<BR>2)Countdown to Extinction (a song that deals not with genocide of the human race but the extinction of our beloved animals.)<BR>3)Architecture of Aggression (there aren't many singers who can fit this in a line)<BR>4)This Was My Life (Very brutal)<BR>5)Ashes in Your Mouth (a classic all the way)<br />The Worst:<BR>Psychotron (bad title and bad tune...Its like Dave wanted to continue the &quot;KIlling is My Business...&quot; song with this crap. The lyrics are completely un-cool. The only good song Ive heard with a title similar to that is the roaring beats of &quot;Motopsycho&quot;.<br />In the end, its a very mainstream album but it has its moments. Great songs all the way.
B00008J4P5|4.0|Still can't get precisely what in White Stripes is so special, that they are unlike some other in wider appearance. They are basing so much on the things of past, still they are more authentic and fresh than plenty of record-companies-manufactured stuff of todays. Though earlier records are exposing beauties of rock-primitivism, this one deals with more varieties on the path. Kind of this couple is creating own version of rock history anew. What an approach. By coincidense, &quot;fat-bottomed-girls&quot; of 78-queen-jazz just appeared afloat in my collection these days, too (one thingie on disk is of similar material). Lennon shouting voice on the other. Returning circles of the past. My rating should be 4.99 - essentially, just because gave too many 5's by now to be treated seriously further :-) Thanks, WS!
0446677450|5.0|In this great book, Robert Kiyosaki motivates the discouraged and uneducated to rise above their current situation and enter the world of the rich through business ownership and investment.  He redefines the value of home ownership and encourages the acquisition of income producing assets to pay for our gadgets and home.  His thinking is solid and mature. He is not selling a get rich quick scheme, and makes sure you understand that you will fail on your path to ultimate success.  I loved this book.  I recommend it highly, and I also recommend Cashflow Quadrant.  Another book I absolutely recommend is Optimal Thinking: How to Be Your Best Self.  Optimal Thinking is the mental software to become emotionally self-reliant, deal with risk most effectively, maintain objectivity and make the most of opportunities in booms and recessions.
B00013F38K|5.0|The TV series Kung Fu, starring David Carradine, Keye Luke and Philip Ahn, became an American popular cultural phenomenon in the 70s and richly deserves a full DVD release. It remains as unique today as it did three decades ago, and potentially as powerful.<br />In the 70s, America was still embroiled in the Vietnam War when Carradine, who played Kwai Chang Caine, walked barefoot into the homes of viewers portraying a Chinese priest of the Shaolin Order who was also a Kung Fu martial arts expert.<br />Through Caine, complex themes of religion, spirituality, philosophy, violence, peace, racism, morality, greed, human dignity and cruelty were examined each week in the guise of an off-beat Western set in the 1800s.<br />Caine, who was part American, was forced to flee his homeland after his mentor, Master Po, portrayed brilliantly by Luke, was murdered by a royal guardman, who in turn was killed by Caine. The royal family issued an edict to capture Caine --- dead or alive.<br />Caine came to America in search of his half-brother, walking from town to town following leads as to his sibling's whereabouts.<br />While the story seems simple enough, it afforded the show's writers ample opportunities to explore the aforementioned themes by depicting Caine's interaction with those who lived in America's Old West, illustrating through the use of extensive flash-backs, the teachings of his Shaolin masters and his Chinese martial arts training. It also provided plenty of excitement and action through Carradine's use of Kung Fu in America, which he frequently employed to protect the less fortunate or otherwise vulnerable victim.<br />Caine's cultural views and religious training that stressed peaceful coexistance with his fellow man, equality and non-materialism, put him at odds with most of those he encountered. Every episode presented moral choices for Caine to make between maintaining his lifestyle and philosophy, or conforming to the norms of American society. In presenting those choices, viewers also examined their own values as well as those of modern society at a time when it was imperitive to do so.<br />Famed martial artist and actor Bruce Lee developed the show's concept with producers and had expected to be cast as Caine. But, when cameras finally rolled on the production, it was Carradine who became Caine, and who would be forever linked to the role.<br />This DVD set was remastered to present the first season, including the show's pilot, in a widescreen format. I'm anxious to see what the show will look like thus depicted. However, this is one TV show that looked great in a full-screen format, so there was really no way to lose on its DVD release. I trust that the remaining seasons will also be released in very short order.hose choices, viewers also examined their own values as well as those of modern society at a time when it was imperitive to do so.<br />Famed martial artist and actor Bruce Lee developed the show's concept with producers and had expected to be cast as Caine.

B00005QZWI|5.0|There are few composers of the twentieth, and now, twenty-first centuries, who will be recognized by future generations for the film scores they have composed.  Some, like John Williams (Star Wars, E.T., Jaws, Schindler's List), have made the exception, with scores that stand alone, and are immediately recognizable to audiences.  <br />I think that this score, composed by Howard Shore, might graduate into this class.  His music, which is haunting and beautiful, paints many vivid images of the world created by J.R.R. Tolkein.  While the music serves as underscoring for the incredible films under Peter Jackson's direction, the music is as beautiful on its own as it is capable of expanding the beauty of the film it enhances.<br />Shore, who was contracted to score all three of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; films, has been part of the film experience since the beginning, being part of the filming process in New Zealand for the better part of the past five years.  As a result, the soundtrack is expansive and intimate, providing themes that perfectly compliment the characters and environments they are intended for.  Its haunting in its beauty, daunting in its depth, and captivating-as it must be, for the films, each of which are a staggering 3+ hours, have a pace to them which keeps audiences engaged for the duration.  The music rises and falls as the action and drama unfolds.<br />Shore, who compares his score to a contemporary Opera, incorporates the voices of an all male, Pacific-Islands choir, a boys choir from England, the beautiful and stirring voice of Enya for the love ballad between Arwyn and Aragorn, musical instruments from the farthest corners of the Earth, including many instruments from African tribal groups, along with a symphonic score that is as bold and breathtaking as the films are.  <br />It could be argued that the soundtrack, along with the film itself, must be as massive as it is to capture the depth of the world Tolkein created over a half century ago.  And it does.  The movies are incredible, as is the music.  This soundtrack is an incredible forum which helps continue the journey into Peter Jackson's vision of Tolkien's novel, and for anyone, from avid fan of The Lord of the Rings, to the most casual listener, the music contained herein is gauranteed to transport you to another world, and another time, when a Hobbit named Frodo led a fellowship of men, elves, drarves and hobbits on a quest that would lead to the salvation of Middle Earth.<br />-Scott Kolecki
B000089RVX|4.0|From Little Rock, Arkansas, Evanescence has ignited a fire deep within me I never knew could be lit. Amy Lee's strong voice, with yet the melody of a mature young woman, IS stunning. The guitar, drums, bass, and effects all combine into one to be lead by Amy's awesome vocals... Yes, Bring me to life can get old IF you listen to it hundreds of times, over and over again. For this reason, you must explore the whole album. I noticed that if you listen to My Immortal, all the way to Whisper, you'll see why Evanescence is filled with such art and talent. Bring Me To Life and Going Under may be loved so much by main- stream because of its hard-heavy sound... But if you look into the lyrics and understand them, you'll see it's not just a bunch of instruments and a beautiful womans vocals. It's the lyrics, a passage through problems of teenagers and adults. Only for people with the name \\"goth\\" on them? Absolutely not! A CD like this deserves to be heard by anyone, no matter what shape, size, color. Basicly anyone who is usually catergorized should listen to this CD atleast once. If only the lyrics were just a tad bit more poetic, I'd give this band 5 stars. Take my word, buy this CD as soon as that next pay check comes in. :)
B00005JLT5|5.0|This movie came highly recommended to me and I must say that I was not disappointed in it. I recommend this movie for a number of reasons. First the story is very intriguing. The presentation Jewish life in Warsaw was quite heart wrenching, this was quite a good angle for featuring a story, very unique. I thoroughly enjoyed the realistic aspect of this movie (beyond that it was based on a true story) that was incorporated by the director, Roman Polanski's, personal experience in WWII.  Secondly, the scenery and cinematography is well done and makes up for the relatively slow pace of this narrative.<br />On one hand I must agree with the other nay-sayer reviews in saying that this movie lacked so much in character development and dialogue. This movie left too much hanging for my liking. Things such as: what happened to his family, friends etc. I'm sure that given the high death toll these things were meant to be obvious, but the main character gives no indication as to his emotions or feelings on the matter. But on the other hand, given the circumstances of life at this time the story could not have been told any other way.<br />The DVD comes with a number of features, such as a documentary, that are also worth watching, I found that listening to Roman Polanski's personal experience in the Ghetto was fascinating. It amazed me the amount of work and detail that went into this film.<br />This movie is well worth a watch for those who are interested in the human cost of war or those who enjoy epics of this time period.

Now that he is almost two years the flaps are getting roughed up but we have definitely got our money's worth.<br />Great illustrations, great flaps that are cut in interesting shapes, and lots of vocabulary opportunities as well as hand coordination.
B000002JSN|4.0|Physical Graffiti was a double album (2-record set) for Led Zeppelin and their last strong album. While they continued the diversity that was present on Led Zeppelin IV and Houses Of The Holy, this album was their first to contain any filler or unmemorable tracks.<br />Disc 1 is easily the better of the 2 discs. The heavy rockers &quot;Custard Pie&quot; and &quot;The Rover&quot; start the album with a great one-two punch. &quot;In My Time Of Dying&quot; is one of their great long tracks, starting out slow and meandering before getting heavy around mid-track. John Bonham's monstrous drumming really carries this track. &quot;Kashmir&quot; is the other epic here and is even more impressive, certainly one of their most memorable riffs. The tracks &quot;Houses Of The Holy&quot; and the acoustic &quot;Bron-yr-aur&quot; are also great tracks. The only misstep here is &quot;Trampled Under Foot&quot;, which is basically a heavier version of the Doobie Brothers' &quot;Long Train Runnin'.&quot; Nonetheless, this is still a great disc.<br />Disc 2 is more diverse and also more hit and miss. &quot;In The Light&quot; is Zeppelin at their most psychedelic. &quot;Down By The Seaside&quot; starts out country, gets heavy after the second chorus, and then goes back to country. &quot;Ten Years Gone&quot; is a great ballad. &quot;Sick Again&quot; is another great rocker. The rest of the tracks are okay, but sound like throwaways when compared to the rest of their work up to this point in their career. &quot;Night Flight&quot; and &quot;The Wanton Song&quot; feature heavy riffs, but are unmemorable. &quot;Boogie with Stu&quot; is decent as is &quot;Black Country Woman&quot;, but they have better acoustic material on their earlier albums. Overall, there are a lot of great songs here. It's just not great from beginning to end like their first five albums were.
B00005JMTN|5.0|I loved \\"Big Fish.\\" Next to \\"The Lord of the Rings:The Return of the King\\" it was one of the quickest movies that I have ever seen, and also one of the movies that I did not want to end. This movie had so much to like, that a shorter list would be the list of things that were bad about it.  I saw \\"Big Fish\\" in Manhattan while it was still in limited release, and now I am waiting to see it again when it expands. And don't listen to the MPAA rating. This movie should have been rated PG- it is not good for all audiences. but certainly for children with there parents. <br />Albert Finney plays Edward Bloom. Bloom likes to tell the many stories of his life, but his stories are false, and he says that they are real, much to the dismay of his son Will, who wants to find out who his father really is, and what happened in his past. Will may get that chance, however, when Edward's wife Sandra calls him and tells him that his father is dying. Will goes to his parents house right away with his preganant wife Josephine, where Will demands to know who his father is. Over the course of Will's visit, we the veiwer hear about Edward's stories. We hear the story of how he and his childhood friends went into the house of a \\"witch\\" who supposdly has an eye that if you look into it, you find out how you die. We hear the story about Edward's meeting with a giant named Karl. He then leaves the town that he grew up in, and while attending a circus he finds his true love. In a special shot where everything freezes where it was, including things that are in mid-air, we see Edward meeting Young Sandra. The owner of the circus makes a deal with him. For every month that Edward works for him, he will get one piece of infomation about Sandra. But my favorite story is the story about the famed poet Norther Winslow. It comes up so fast, and it's so hilarious because it's the last thing that you would expect happen. Winslow is played by Steve Buscemi, who is a brilliant actor who you see everywhere. You've probally seen him in \\"Ghost World\\", \\"Big Daddy\\", \\"Fargo,\\" and many other films. <br />Tim Burton directed \\"Big Fish\\" and I can't think of another director that could have made this movie perfectly. The man who produced \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas,\\" and \\"James and the Giant Peach.\\" If you are a fan of Tim Burton, you'll love \\"Big Fish.\\" It is filmed in the usual Burton style. It is a strange movie, but very realistic. It is hilarious at times, and then full of heart at others. The only other movies that came out this fall that contained those elements were \\"Something's Gotta Give,\\" and \\"Matchstick Men,\\" but the stories from all three of these movies combined are complety different and have nothing to do with the other, except for the elements that create the genre. \\"Big Fish,\\" was simply a great movie, and it is a movie that I have never seen anything like. Even the acting was brilliant. I really like Ewan McGregor. I liked him in \\"Moulin Rouge,\\" I liked him in \\"Down with Love,\\" I liked him the last two Star Wars movies, and I liked him in \\"Big Fish.\\" All of the other cast members were great but I do think that McGregor deserves an Oscar nod for this. If \\"Big Fish\\" was nominated for an Oscar, I believe that it has a strong chance of winning. I really hope this review makes it to amazon so I could stress the fact to people that \\"Big Fish\\" is one of the best movies of the year. <br />ENJOY!<br />Rated PG-13 for a fight scene, some images of nudity and a suggestive reference. <br />Big Fish is also one my top 25 list. Just look through my lists and you'll find that list.
0375432302|5.0|I read this book in TWO days, I simply could not, would not put it down...absolutely remarkable.  This book is not only wonderfully written, the reader comes away from the book yearning for more, more, more.  This book is daring, cunning, fast-paced, EVERYTHING a superb suspense novel should be.  You owe it to yourself to read this book!

B00005K3OT|3.0|It's interesting to see that there's so much activity for this film since it's been released for quite awhile.  However, perhaps Depp's recent performances have drawn attention to it.  After watching him in \\"Pirates of the Caribbean,\\" I realized that he might be one of the best young actors in our time.  I mean he can really act like different people...not just take type-cast rolls.  And so I wanted to see his work here.<br />What I found was a blatant skewing of a storyline to engage people while communicating a specific message.  While most intelligent books & movies now try to show how multi-dimensional everyone is...how difficult it is to simply cast someone as \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\"...this movie does the reverse.  As characters are introduced, you are quickly able to assign them to one of 2 camps: good enlighted folks or bad religious uptight folks.  (There's also one bad drunken guy who is taken in by the bad religious folks for their own agenda.)<br />What unfolds, then, is not a film about the transformation of human nature or the triumph of hero in a realistic set of circumstances.  Rather, you have an \\"unlikely\\" heroine cast in a role where she's bound to succeed in proving how good she ultimately is.  (She has all good people on her side, of course).  This mysterious woman who works on Sunday & has an illegitmate daughter basically acts as the religious figure of the movie.  She heals the sick, protects the vulnerable, brings together the lonely and even, yes, loves her enemies.  The bad people are eventually either \\"converted\\" to her side or made to look absolutely ridiculous.  They are degraded and dismissed.<br />Depp's character makes an interesting entrance towards the end of this movie.  As usual, I think he played his role well.  He plays the intelligent, intriguing, competent gypsy he's supposed to be.  I like his character, but I wished there was more of him.<br />In the end, I had very mixed feelings about the film.  I felt that the artsy people behindthe film (not necessarily the author of the original book) were using this film to express their own internal emotions.  It was like they poured themselves into this heroine and tried to make you understand how good & sincere they are - despite their unconventional lifestyles.  <br />And it is engaging.  I legitimately liked the heroine & hoped she would succeed.  I felt like I had to use all my intellectual power (which is, admittedly, minimal) to pull back from the emotional draw of the movie in order to analyze the realisticness of the plot.  As I said at the beginning, my ultimate feeling is that this is a blatantly skewed plot used to communicate a message.  And that's not necessarily a bad thing...perhaps it's just good to be aware of.
B00003JRCQ|3.0|My copy of the novel &quot;Persuasion&quot; refers to it as having an &quot;autumnal&quot; tone, which has definitely carried over into this adaptation. It makes no pretensions to being another &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; or &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, lacking those books' underlying theme of warm friendship between sisters. Nor is it like &quot;Emma&quot; or &quot;Northanger Abbey,&quot; both comedies featuring immature women and their self-discovery. In other words, &quot;Persuasion&quot; may be a disappointment to those who passionately love one of those other stories, and expect the same thing. This is ironic, considering that some believe &quot;Persuasion&quot; was based on an incident in Jane Austen's real life, where she apparently turned away a suitor in her youth, and later regretted it.<br />Again - the &quot;autumnal&quot; tone is picked up by the two leads, who are older and less conventionally attractive than, say, Kate Beckingsdale or Jeremy Northam. Ciaran Hinds has a quiet charisma that grows the longer you watch him, and has developed into a viable leading man. Amanda Root begins the film as a grey little mouse and transforms into a more lovely woman halfway through, solely through her skill as an actress, and not through a film of vasoline smeared on the camera.<br />Those who complain that Root is not pretty enough to fit their mental image are missing the point, and probably did not read the book, where Austen points out that Anne's beauty had faded with age. (As we read on, we realize that it's her love for life that's dimmed, which in turn has affected her attractiveness to others. Her handsome father certainly becomes less good-looking each time his prissy behavior is described.)<br />In the film, it would be easy to pull a &quot;Grease&quot;-like transformation - where, like Olivia Newton John, Amanda Root comes out all dolled up in makeup and a hot bodice, ready to jump on the Regency tilt-a-whirl. But the Captain and Anne regaintheir passion for another through their rediscovery of each other's hearts, not their good looks - although seeing each other's good character instantly brightens their countenance and puts a spring in their step, making them much more attractive. Neither Hinds nor Root need a gallon of makeup to make this transformation believable.<br />The two performances that I enjoyed most, however, were that of Sophie Thompson and Fiona Shaw. Thompson, who was only vaguely boorish in &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral,&quot; as a woman despairing of meeting a quality mate, goes full-hog as a high maintenance mooch. Very funny.<br />Shaw, on the other hand, is one of the funniest things about the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; movies, as Harry's dreadful aunt. Here, she is positively vibrant as a happy naval wife. She just brims with love and vigor, believable as a woman who has travelled the seas to be with her husband, and who wishes happiness for her younger brother and all around her. Both the character and the portrayal make a fine contrast to Anne's waspish sisters and father, and the overindulgent yet loving Musgroves. Only five years older than costar Root, with what seems to be a great range, I wonder what charm Shaw might have brought to the role of Anne if she had been offered the part at an appropriate age.<br />This is a warm, and yes, subtle movie, which will chase away the blues on a winter day.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|When my friend suggested we go see this movie, I thought I was getting dragged to some chick flick.  I was reluctant, but she wasn't in town long and so I went.<br />When I came out from watching to movie, I was stunned silent.  So was she.  And generally we both love analyzing books & movies to death.  All either of us could say was, \\"That was one of the best movies I've ever seen.\\"  And we understood each other's silence and rested in the comfort that the other had been just as stunned.<br />Does that sound too dramatic?  I'm sorry if it does.  I was, after all, expecting complete romantic rubbish.  And I don't hate Hugh Grant by any stretch of the imagination, but his characters aren't really inspiring.  If you feel that way, though, you should watch this movie.  You really catch a different side of him.  He plays an intelligent, witty, self-absorbed bachelor...which, apparently, is much closer to who Hugh Grant is as a person.  No insult is intended...but, from what I read, Grant appears to a loner, an introvert, a perfectionist, and - well - a bachelor ever since some unfortunate events in his life.<br />OK, that all said, I should move onto the movie's plot.  Basically, you have this incredibly selfish bachelor (Grant) whose character is immediately engaging because he is incredibly aware of & honest about being selfish.  I found his character to be a complete breath of fresh air after being surrounded by so many people pretending to be something else.  He was honest...and he was even sincere if you could look his armor of self-indulgent behaviors.<br />Then you have this boy Marcus.  (Yes, it's about a real 12 year old boy.  It's not a romance about some guy.)  And this boy is incredibly intelligent for his age.  Incredibly!  But he's also completely lost in his own world - which you can understand when you meet his mother...and, later, his father.  His clothes are enough to get him beat up without his singing in class & getting walked to school by his mom.<br />But, don't worry, it's not as predictable as Grant getting together with Marcus's mom.  That would make it a romance.  Instead, you have a very quirky set of events to bring this man and this boy together.  Some of the events are some of the funniest scenes I'd seen in a long time.  However, some of the other scenes are an unglamorized look at the struggles most people are going through.  <br />And, I must mention that I absolutely LOVE the wake-up call given to the hippy, earth-loving culture.  I somewhat border on this culture b/c I love trees & earth & loose clothing & all things natural.  However, sometimes it goes too far and this movie calls it like it is...which I never thought would happen in a liberal industry like film.  I thought a film would be trashed immediately if it questioned such lifestyles.  But this script is so intelligent & realistic that you can't help but agree.<br />Ultimately, I think it's this interlacing of witty genius, sincere characters, bold commentary and realistic emotion that makes this movie a masterpiece.  You never can relax and dismiss it as a comedy.  But you can never settle & dismiss it as a drama.  It's this incredibly poignant mix of antics, relationships - functional & disfunctional, sincere characters with flaw, and vivid realism that draws me in to this movie every time I watch it.  I have yet to get tired of this movie & I love sharing the joy of it with others.
0385504209|2.0|Interesting for the first 100 pages.  After that, the plot quickly loses steam.  I expected more theory and research, much in the way Graham Hancock writes in &quot;Fingerprints of the Gods,&quot; or &quot;The sign and the Sea.&quot;<br />Here, there were absolutely no references to where Brown received his information.  His theory is interesting, yet is merely an opinion.  THe book contains interesting &quot;side-notes&quot; of academic worth, but even these are not sufficient to salvage the disaster that is the main plot.<br />Though provoking, yet highly disappointing.

B0000C6E4D|3.0|I am huge fan of Sarah Mclachlan, love her concerts and previous albums, and enjoy her unique malodic voice.  Like all her other fans, I've waited years for her to produce a new album and was very excited when Afterglow apeared on the shelves.  Saddly, this is not up to her usual high artistic standards of quality.  Fumbling Towards Ecstacy, with its divine balads and folksy style was a tremendous album.  Afterglow seems a bit repetative.  The music lacks the emotional persuation and longing of her previous work.  <br />While I enjoyed the album, I was disapointed by the lack of range and rather repetative nature of the album.  On the whole, I would rather listen to her older works.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|As has been said before in all these reviews, FOX broadcasting should take the execs that cancelled this show out back and have them shot.<BR>Firefly is one of those one in a million shows where all the right people just happened to be picked to work on it.  Everyone from the fx crew to the cameramen to the writers and most amazingly, the actors, gelled into what would have been one of the most amazing tv series of our time.  And if you think I'm just some fanboy here to plug the DVD's, then do a Google on &quot;Firefly&quot; and read some of the other online reviews.<BR>Granted the backdrop is unusual - spaceships and cowboys, but the acting was just superb, and the chemistry between the actors became apparent in the first hour of the pilot (Which somehow FOX decided to air only after they cancelled the series.  Talk about not giving a show a chance!)  The music was simply amazing, the cinematography was fresh and new, using focus and sudden pans in ways TV should see more of, and the writing!  Oh the writing!  The writing is such that you will be laughing one moment and crying the next, with storylines that would twist and turn as if Hitchcock himself had helped pen them.  For the writing alone, you should get this DVD.  I guarantee that after the first disk, you'll be a fan, and after the last, you too will be looking for FOX exec's heads to roll...
B00009TB5G|4.0|These special edition DVD sets for the two Lord of the Rings films are impressive achievements.  On the 4 DVDs of the Two Towers there is no wasted space.  Due to the length of the film, the feature itself covers two discs and looks/sounds fantastic on my system (albeit an older/smaller system).  The next two DVDs contain documentaries on all aspects of the filmaking from the preproduction storyboards to the postproduction generation of special effects.  For my money, the documentaries are better (more interesting, flow better) than the equivalent documentaries on Film #1.  At 6 hours on each of the two films, there is bound to be some overlap between the docs on Film #1 and #2, but it's surprisingly small, to the credit of the DVD producers.  I'll admit that I haven't watched all the extras (i.e. I haven't listened to all 4 audio commentaries), but so far I've been impressed by the lack of overlap and overall level of interest the extras generate.<br />At nearly 4 hours, the extended version of the film is 45 minutes longer than the theatrical release.  Most of the additions are well worthwhile, adding depth and comedy to the action.  However, I have the same objection to this film as to the first - it's not what Peter Jackson has left out that's the problem, it's that he's tried to include too much, which makes some parts confused and/or overcrowded.  There are three basic stories that need to be told in this film: 1. Frodo and Sam trying to reach Mordor, with Gollum as guide; 2. The siege of Helm's Deep and the recruitment of Rohan to the cause; and 3. Merry, Pippen, and the Ents attack on Isengard.  Everything else is subsidiary and should have been done away with.  For example, Jackson cuts the Fords of Isen battle way back, but there's no reason to introduce it at all!  Likewise: while it's important to introduce Faramir, there is no reason to depict Frodo and Sam's imprisonment by him.<BR>  <BR>This is why the film blows up beyond all rational time limitations, and why the dense Tolkien books are so difficult to translate to the screen.  Jackson does do an admirable job at an impossible task, but anyone who has not read the books will be unable to keep track of all the characters, let alone follow all the intracacies of the plot.  The films then reduce to a series of massive battles.  However, fans of the books are likely to find much to like about the film.  In fact, I would rate this one higher than the first film - Jackson seems to cover more material in the same amount of time, and I think most of the Two Towers is on the screen, although the film ends considerably before the book.  (e.g., Gandalf does not get to Isengard, and Sam and Frodo do not reach Shelob's lair)<br />Therefore, fans of the film should not bother with any DVD version other than this one.  The Two Towers is a spectacle not to be missed.  The added scenes are well worthwhile (more so than many that survived into the theatrical cut, in fact).  The film itself is superior to the first film overall, although my favourite sequence remains the Weathertop battle from the first film.
B00005JLT5|4.0|Q: What was the specific appeal here?<BR>In this case I wanted to feel that I was being honest with myself.  Sometimes I see something that I've done that I didn't necessarily feel that I'd nailed it.  But what's important is that I move me, the journey would be less interesting for me if I didn't. I felt that I had a real responsibility in this case more than with most roles because I was playing an actual historical figure, and of course because of the personal historical nature of the film for Roman Polanski, the director.<br />Q: He has a reputation for being quite a hard taskmaster, did he live up to it here?<BR>He did give us a rough ride, but I don't think it was unfair.  I think he expects a lot from everyone, and I expect a lot from myself too so I identified with that.  I can also understand how he would have expected a lot from me in particular in this film because this is the most personal film he's made.  It was a huge honour for me, and I felt a great deal of pressure but at the same time he treated me with a great respect and regard to my work.  <br />Q: How much research did you do for the role?<BR>Quite a bit. Roman was very helpful in that his office lent me a lot of documentary footage and I had some literature that I had read.  And Wladyslaw Szpilman's memoirs were very helpful as it was first hand information. But at the same time I was given a lot of leeway with the physicality of the character, because although he was known he was no so known that people remember how he looked and behaved. <br />Q: Was playing the piano a crucial component to the character for you, too?<BR>It helped my connection with the character, which I wouldn't have known prior to doing the work.  As opposed to acting as if I was playing the piano, I started to not only know the notes but control the levels of emotion and the subtlety within  the music which gave me a greater understanding of the story within the music.  <br />Q: Did you ever feel that your own discomfortwas as nothing compared to what the characters in the story went through?<BR>It was minuscule compared to the level of real suffering that exists in this world currently, and has obviously existed in the past.  I felt that I owed that much, at least, to go there. It was awful really, there's an emptiness and a longing that you experience when you're really starving that I hadn't experienced until now. I couldn't have acted that without knowing that pain. As an actor you can call upon similar emotions and try and conjure up these past feelings and torment yourself into re-experiencing them in a sense. I wanted to know the desperation that comes with hunger, and also it was very important to Roman that there was a very clear difference in my physical appearance.  I lost 30 pounds in six weeks.<br />Q: Was the diet closely supervised?<BR>Well they supplied me with someone who was supposedly knowledgeable in the field but part of it was telling me not to drink too much water which I agreed to, but I'm sure that's not too healthy.  It looked good.  It felt terrible, but it looked good.  And in doing that it became very real.  I had no energy for anything else but that, for piano lessons, dialect lessons, rehearsal and thinking about food.  <br />Q: Were you never concerned about putting your own health at risk?<BR>I have mixed feelings about risking my health, because I hadn't really done that before.  I didn't realise at the time what a great story it was that I had lost 30 pounds for the role, at the time I was just doing it out of necessity. I didn't see far ahead, I tried to take each day and do all I could for that day and then go to sleep and wake up the next day and see what I could do.  Aside form anything else it's made me see things clearer, and also made me very aware of how much pain and suffering exists for so many people. <br />Q: How easy was it to put the weight back on when you needed to?<BR>It was strange because it totally screwed up my eating habits.I was so consumed with thoughts of food for so long that I had this insatiable appetite. I had to slowly start eating a bit because it was supposed to be very unhealthy to eat a lot, but within the first week I had to do a scene where I had to devour all this sausage, and he kept shooting the scene because he wanted something different.  With each take I had to eat a tremendous amount of this sausage, and I was literally sick because my body couldn't metabolise it. <br />Q: Wasn't that a little worrying?<br />It concerned me at first because it changed the way I metabolised food and my body reacted differently for a while. I looked different, in my face and appearance, I gained the weight differently and I thought I'd completely screwed up my system because it reset me into a kind of storage mode. <br />Q: After all these serious roles are you looking to lighten up with something in the future?<BR>Yeah, I need a break, I need a little lighter journey. I'd like some romance at some point, if it was well written.   That would be great.    It's a different process, but it's somehow less fulfilling.  I don't like to suffer but somehow I find some kind of greater connection to the work when I do.
B00005JMFR|5.0|(Includes some storyline)<br />What, I only get five stars to rate this?  I need more!  A great end to the best trilogy of all time.  What makes this trilogy so great?  It is unique to the highest degree, complete with a spectacular finish.  Revolutions stayed true to the series.  If you liked the first one, you should love this one.  I say that because Revolutions didn't suddenly deviate from the series, it was The Matrix through and through. If anybody says they liked the first one and not Revolutions, they most certainly missed something.<br />Some say it was devoid of emotion and overloaded with special effects.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  If the seemingly inevitable slaughter of thousands of people and the efforts to save them is not emotional, my friend, I would say you have no feelings.  And the battle against the sentinels with the giant APU units was breathtaking. I was especially moved by Neo's decision to go into the heart of the machine world in the flesh.  Think of how this ties into the first one!  Neo could only go there because of how he destroyed Agent Smith at the end of the first movie.  Smith became such a problem; that was Neo's bargaining chip.  So you see, it's all good.  It didn't suddenly change, like many say.<br />A piece of advice: quit overanalyzing things, sit back, and try to have fun.  Nothing will ruin a good movie more than a closed mind and bad attitude.  Relax and enjoy yourself!
B00005JLK1|1.0|In Brief<br />When Canadian Air Force pilot Jack Ferriman (Harrington) recruits the salvage crew aboard the tugboat Arctic Warrior to investigate a mysterious vessel he has spotted adrift in a remote region of the Bering Sea, they discover the remains of the fabled Antonia Graza.  Thought lost at sea for more than 40 years, once onboard the eerie cavernous ship, the crew discover that the decaying vessel is anything but deserted.  It's home to something more deadly and horrific than anything they've encountered in all their years at sea.<br />Review<br />There is something knowing in this films charm.  Yes its decidedly corny, but as it opens with 1940s period credits, one cant help but think its always giving you a sly nudge and wink throughout.  Unlike other horror films, this doesnt rely on over the top MTV editing but rather classic jumps and scares, building a solid if what somewhat flawed 90 minutes of entertainment.  <br />Opening with one the most original mass killings that I can recall, it is hilariously disgusting throughout.  And while, the story slows briefly to introduce everyone, it picks up apace and has beautifully depicted montage to Mudvaynes latest song. Captain Sean Murphy (Byrne) is a slat weathered old hand, and lends the story some weight while team leader Maureen Epps (Margulies) and First Mate Greer (Washington) engage with the basic script aplomb.  <br />Hidden within this film, is a twist that will have you kicking yourself, and while the haunted house concept of Ghost Ship has yet to produce a classic, its filled with moments that bring it close.  The premise may be unoriginal but Ghost Ship is still worth a look, if only for a chance to laugh at an ending that is as knowing as it is ridiculous.  <br />The Verdict<br />Ghost Ship provides a fun night out; its not necessarily going to scare you ridged, but how many films really do that in our desensitised days?  It is gruesome, making me laugh on plenty of occasions, and withthe talent on display here you have to conclude that they knew what they were creating.  The Sun would call it, A fun filled thrill ride, Id call it A hilariously disgusting B movie, either way check it out!
B00008ADPF|4.0|Thank God some people still have great taste in Music to even out those who have no taste at all! Nickelback... Know that we're out here! This CD kicks A**. Nickelbacks true talent shines in this album and how anyone who was ever a Nickelback fan couldn't love The Long Road is beyond understanding! True Nickelback fans you won't be disapointed! Nickelback... THANKS!
B00011RPB0|5.0|The Plot:  Lost in a foreign world & indeed their own lives, two hapless individuals' paths cross in a downtown Tokyo hotel.  The two Americans: one an ageing actor, the other a young wife find a common ground, filling a void that their respective relationships share. <br />Standout Scene:  It's an old joke, but Murray's bemusement is spot on, as sitting on the set of his latest Whiskey commercial, a torrent of foreign words pours from the Japanese director's mouth only for a less-than-able translator to pass on his wishes in a single word!<br />Any Good?  Once again, Sophia proves that by recent comparison she is a better director than Daddy Coppola.  While it gets stuck in its own story mid-way, the result is worth the attention.  A genuinely funny romance is rare on screen these days as Lost in Translation proves that true love CAN exist in friendship alone: CLASSIC!
B000024D4R|5.0|This albumb, Amimals, I consider to be one of the most significant works of Pink.  This is by far one of my favorites besides the wall, and piper at the gates of dawn.  all i have to say it is a must have for any serious collector of fine music and really wants a jewel for their collection.  don't believe me, listen to it yourself, the music speaks for itself..
B00011RPB0|5.0|The Plot:  Harvey Pekar took his dead-end life as a file clerk in the early Eighties and became a minor celebrity by basing a hit cult comic around himself.  From the difficulties of being stuck in line at a supermarket through to battling Cancer, his work is brilliantly portrayed as the film uses a mix of animation, the perfectly cast Giamatti, while blending both archive footage and recent narration by the real life Pekar perfectly.  <br />Standout Scene:  As reality is suspended briefly the actors take a backseat to listen to Pekar & the supremely funny Toby Radloff take centre stage.  <br />Any Good?   Pekar once called out David Letterman's talk show as manipulative shtick and American Splendor makes no bones about giving one in the eye to the establishment too.  This is a genuinely funny film from the ultimate `anti-American-Dreamer,' and should definitely not be missed.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|I was very pleased to get the latest CD by Iron Maiden. It is great to see the old crew from Piece of Mind and Powerslave back, and Janick Gers (added for Fear of the Dark) is still on-board giving Iron Maiden 3 axe-men. All of the songs harken back to 80s and early 90s hard rock and the narrative-style lyrics sung by the incomporable Bruce Dickinson coupled with the flowing guitar melodies from Smith, Murray, and Gers make for some very memorable songs. Listen to Rainmaker, Montsegur, Paschendale. These are great songs! A Maiden fan starving for nostalgia will not be disappointed.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I was dragged to the cinema by my son to see this film and thank heavens I was. This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. The style of this film is quirky in the extreme and the camera work can leave you dizzy but nevertheless this film has you gripped from the first frame to the last. It is a basic love story centring on a courtesan, Satine, who falls for penniless writer, Christian. Meanwhile, a rich English Duke is determined to possess Satine whatever the cost.<br />Moulin Rouge is a vibrant kaleidoscope of colour and movement set to music that just shouldn't work but thanks to some really clever arranging it does. The scene where Zidler and the Duke perform their version of Madonna's 'Like a Virgin' is hilarious. There are many well-known songs throughout the film, but all are given a new slant and performed in a unique way.<br />The main stars are Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman and there is an on screen chemistry between them that makes their characters relationship believable. What's more they can sing...not something either was known for prior to this. The ever-talented Jim Broadbent stars as Zidler, owner of the Moulin Rouge and Richard Roxburgh is the Duke.<br />This DVD set has a wealth of extras, enough to keep anyone occupied for hours and there are many, many hidden extras for those who like hunting. The sound and picture quality are superb. This is a movie that seems to arouse strong emotions, people either love it or hate it but no one seems indifferent to it.
B000001FS3|5.0|Like da Vinci's Virgin on the Rocks II. You absorb it long enough (either through ear or eye) and you find a man's vision of Godliness.
B000002JKA|5.0|This album was (at least before ToT) called DT's least progressive album, but that is not exactly true.<br /><br />Actually \\"Awake\\" is a strong musical work, filled with obvious technical parts, but most of its qualities rely on the song writting. Its atmospheres are created from the mix of music and lyrics, reaching a result with no equal in their discography or any other prog metal band.<br /><br />It also features one of their great epics, \\"A MIND BEHIND IT SELF\\", which is divided in 3 parts and presents John Petrucci best lyrics. \\"EROTOMANIA\\" is still their most complex intrumental piece and it simply musically quotes the album through the use of melodies and harmonies from other songs from \\"Awake\\".<br /><br />Of course it is dark and heavy, but I haven't seen  Portnoy doing such adventurous drumming like on \\"Caught In A Web\\" or \\"Erotomania\\" next.<br /><br />\\"Mirror\\" and \\"Lie\\" have the heaviest DT's side, and I finally have to admit that Kevin Moore was the one that glued the elements for their greatness. I do enjoy the following albums a lot, specially SFAM, but Awake remains absolutely at the top of my list.<br /><br />With all due respect to Derek and Jordan (two of the best keyboardists in this world), Kevin Moore was the perfect element to tie all the member qualities and create music.<br /><br />This is by far, my all time favorite album.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|This CD set is a great tribute album. When a song first started, I expected the singer to be George. But then you realize it's one of his friends and he's not here with us anymore. But the performances are so good, it's as if George invited his friends to play with him and he let them do the singing, with him playing next to them. I have the DVD but haven't watched it yet. But from the way the CD sounds, the DVD should be even better. A great gift from George's family &amp; friends to his memory!
B00005JKZU|1.0|I'll be fairly straight here...<br />This movie is the worst or the 3. Only see it to get the basic picture of what happens between the 1st and 3rd movies. It is dreary, unimaginative and badly filmed. All the actors have gone weird and tried to make the movie their own, while all failing. It has no scenes that give you a real feeling of the trilogy and the scenes themselves do nothing but explain, or repeat, what's happening.<br />Do not bother buying it unless you're one of those nuts who has to have the whole series, no matter what. The other two are great, however.
B000002J09|5.0|Great is all i can say. its got stairway to heaven and all sorts of good stuff.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show is by far and away the best stuff on small AND large screens. The actors gelled from day one, seen in the proper order on this set. Unfortunately, this show makes all the rest of the garbage on t.v. that much worse. Without the added intelligence and wit of Firefly, I fear my televsion watching days are numbered. I would even subscribe to cable just to get the sci-fi channel if they were to pick it up (under some miracle!) I am looking forward to future adventures.
B0000C1733|5.0|This is a great album for anyone who has ever liked ANYTHING from RHCP.  I ordered this album and the new album from THE HIPPOS online and when they were delivered, it was the greatest day of the year.  First, I got The Hippos album, which brought me great joy (it's a good album and I recommend it highly).  THEN, I started listening to this one, and i got real happy.  It's a lot like THE HIPPOS album I had just heard, but still brought back soo many great memories.  RHCP HAS ruled, DOES rule and WILL ALWAYS rule!  Go get this album, even if you're not a RHCP fan (and THe Hippos self-titled album if you have time).  It's WELL WORTH IT!
B000005IU2|4.0|Hey CT reviewer, the truth doesn't hurt as much as it does when you were dropping all those names on my feet. And such hip and cool names! Maybe you can star in School of Rock 2.<br />This album rocks. It's from the heart, and it's ruthless and inventive. This is what real artists were up to while the Stones were busy cribbing from Gram Parsons and passing out in chateau hallways.
B000060P79|4.0|This album is really fun.  Undoubtedly one of the best of 2003.  If all I could do all day is listen to this album and THE HIPPOS new album, I'd be set for life.  Those guys are SO FUN! (Simple Plan AND THE HIPPOS) I hope all their future albums are as good as this one.  I will FOREVER compare Simple Plan to THE HIPPOS, and right now, they're doing a pretty good job.

B000094J5T|5.0|It's hard to watch this film and not think of the situation in the Middle East today.  What is worse, being stuffed into cattle cars and sent to death camps or being blown up by suicide bombers (or bulldozed by machines of steel)?  For me the answer to this strangely relevant question is the former.  I know that the old Jewish Defense League that I recall from my college days, whose slogan was something like, \\"Never Again,\\" would agree and so would most of the population of Israel.  I think the terrorist Islamic groups ought to be required to view this film and/or some others like it on what happened to the Jews in Europe during the time of the Nazis so that they might have a better appreciation of why they will never be able to overrun Israel and why the United States continues to support Israel even while questioning some of Sharon's policies.<br />Director Roman Polanski tells the familiar horror tale, this time with a concentration on the Jews of Warsaw and in particular on the famed pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman.  (The screenplay by Ronald Hardwood is based on Szpilman's memoir).  Polanski spares us none of the brutality or the sadomasochism that is an inevitable interpretation of the events.  He has the Jews meekly acquiesce to the increasingly horrific Nazi demands, and then has them just lie down when told to and accept a bullet through the skull.<br />(Actually the vast majority of the Jews were not shot, of course, since the bullets were too costly and needed elsewhere.  Indeed, as long as I am doing an aside, the stupidity of the Nazis in wasting their resources in genocide contributed to their losing the war.  Small irony.  But of course that was a war they could not win anyway.  If by some magic they could have gotten the Jews--especially Jewish physicists--to work for them, that would have been their only chance, which once again demonstrates the self-destructive nature of Hitler and his followers.)<br />Polanski shows us the Jews who collaborated with the Nazis and he even has a Jewish boy in the compound as they await the cattle cars selling candy at inflated prices, and then later a Nazi who talks to his Jewish workers about trading goods and says, rubbing his fingers together, \\"That's what you're good at, isn't it?\\"<br />It is interesting to compare The Pianist with Vittoria De Sica's The Garden of the Finzi-Continis (1971), an entirely different sort of film, but one with a similar theme and some similar scenes as the Jews, this time Italian Jews, are loaded into the cattle cars.  The experience in these films is always the same for me in at least one respect.  I want so much to shout: \\"Do something!  Don't let it happen!  Charge them with the sheer mass of your bodies, if nothing else.  Better to die fighting than to die like cattle.\\"  But of course I was not there.  We think we know what we would do, but unless we are confronted with the actual situation, we don't know.  And of course we have hindsight.<br />At one point, Szpilman and his brother are talking as they eat their thin soup and their bread.  The brother tells him that the cattle cars are going to Treblinka but they return empty and that there are no cars containing food that go that way.  He concludes, \\"They are exterminating us.\\"<br />Polanski's point is that the Nazis were able to actually commit their ghastly mass murders (and the German populace to excuse them) because they had come to believe that Jews were not human and that they were only killing vermin.  The Jews had been demonized, which is the first step toward genocide.  We declare that our enemies are not human, and that allows us to kill them with moral impunity.  I had a new thought while I watched this time, thinking: a respect for animals and a belief in animal rights might serve as a moral buffer so that when one group of people hate each other and begin to turn the other into animals, they will still have a step to go before they can begin the mass murders.<br />It is in the second half when Szpilman goes into hiding that Polanski's film distinguishes itself.  Here the focus is entirely on Szpilman and his need to survive.  The cinematography of the Warsaw streets, the apartments he lives in, the snow, the gray buildings, the people below in the streets, the hunger, the music that he hears in his mind but cannot play, the burned-out buildings, and then the scene in which the German officer says, \\"Play something\\" and he does.  It is here that the film becomes magical and a testament to the best that is in humans.  Note that the pianist has become in his beard and his persecution a Christ-like figure who never raised a hand against anyone.  He is the Christ who turned the other cheek.  And note that it is his ethereal talent as a great musician that saves him.  This is Polanski's message and the reason he made the film.  The best that is in humans can rise above the brute that is in humans.<br />See this for Adrien Brody, who gave it everything he had, and then some.  His performance will haunt you.  Polanski's clear, Hollywood-like, almost Spielbergian direction, tells the story a bit too brightly at times, and a bit too simplistically at others, but he has planned well so that in the end we see that he has told it brilliantly.  For those who have never actually had the details of the Holocaust acted out for them, this will be quite an eye-opener and a chilling, depressing and deeply disturbing experience.  And see it because we need to be reminded of what can happen when we give way to hate and prejudice.nd half when Szpilman goes into hiding that Polanski's film distinguishes itself.

B000069AUI|2.0|THis album was my least favorite so far.  I'm worried now.  I'm not sure what it is, but somethings just not right here.  I got this album and THE HIPPOS new album and i was very surprised when I concluded the THE HIPPOS' album is FAR better then this one.  I would have never expected that, but THE HIPPOS have a lot of great pop/rock intelligence on their new album.  My recommendation is that you buy this album, cuz it's still coldplay and it's alright, THEN go online and get THE HIPPOS' new (and final) album, cuz it's AMAZING!
7119024086|5.0|I too like many read this book because of the games, and even though I am only 15 I found this book to be the greatest piece of literature i've ever read. From start to finish this book is filled with action. You can learn many lessons about friendship, brotherhood, courage, chivalry, and strategy. After reading this tale you become wiser in almost every aspect of life, I definately recommend this book for any serious reader.

The songs really make someone look at themselves and the lives that they lead. This is not by any means a &quot;feel good&quot; record. There are no catchy, pop songs on this record at all...and sometimes that is just what someone needs to hear.

6305922756|5.0|One of the funniest films of all time, and certainly one of the cleverest, \\"This is Spinal Tap\\" is as equally hysterical and subtle today as it was twenty years ago, back when Rob Reiner was pretty much known for his iconic role on the television show \\"All in the Family\\" -- not yet for \\"The Princess Bride,\\" \\"When Harry Met Sally...\\", \\"A Few Good Men,\\" and certainly not for being an excellent director. (Now, by 2004, his films have occupied many of the various AFI lists, including the best romance films and comedies.)<br />\\"This is Spinal Tap\\" was the first of its kind -- a so-called \\"rockumentary\\" following the dissipation of a terrible British hard rock band during the mid-80s, with songs like \\"Sex Farm\\" ample proof of their considerably awful talent.<br />Tons of bands like Spinal Tap were popular during the 1980s, then soon fell out of the public eye. Not many of them even had much talent at all -- just drugged-out band members and lots of rebellious attitudes as their primary advertising campaign.<br />Because Spinal Tap is so close to reality, and because it is so ridiculously ironic and yet far-fetched, it has achieved a massive army of fans and even a famed Criterion Collection DVD (now out of print, unfortunately). The film was never exactly a smash at the box office, but its popularity -- like so many famous films -- grew rapidly over the years since its release, having gradual re-releases (the sure-fire sign of a cult film) and lots of fake reunion concerts. (One of which was recently released onto a DVD.)<br />Legend has it that after the film was released in 1984, people often came up to Rob Reiner on the street and they would say, \\"I really liked your movie, but I wish you would have chosen a more popular band to do a film on.\\"<br />Yes, Spinal Tap is absolutely false. It's not a real band. But it's hard to tell at times. Some people don't like the film because they find it too real -- but I think that's the whole idea.<br />As the film fades into focus, we are introduced to Marty DiBergi (Reiner), a documentary film maker who was drawn to Spinal Tap, the UK heavy metal rock band, early on in their career -- he admired their \\"loud\\" songs and now, at the height of their career, he is setting out to record their private lives that exist behind the stage.<br />The three main rockers are Nigel (Christopher Guest), David (Michael McKean), and Derek (Harry Shearer), who go around the world on rock tours, inspiring lots of loud noise amongst fans and upsetting a lot of people -- like the limo driver played by Bruno Kirby (\\"The Godfather Part II\\") in a pre-\\"When Harry Met Sally\\" cameo. (Billy Crystal also makes a cameo as a mime waiter in one of the most subtle scenes -- look quick, you might miss him.)<br />The cast performed all their own songs, as well as writing them. Guest, McKean and Shearer are all gifted musicians -- but they're also pretty funny. Part of what makes this film so effective on repeat viewings is that you're guaranteed to find some things you didn't notice last time. John Hughes once said that he liked to place small background quirks in his films (such as the crawling mice in \\"Planes, Trains and Automobiles\\") so that, on repeat viewings on television, someone watching might drift from the main focus of the film to the background of the sequence -- and there's the hidden gag that isn't even all that funny, just...different.<br />Your first viewing of \\"Spinal Tap\\" might be less than enthusastic. But I beg of you, watch it again, take a chance to open your ears more, pay attention to small things in the background, and listen to those songs the guys are singing. That's where much of the comedy lies. This is a film that is definitely worth owning for such purposes.<br />Speaking of hidden elements, much has been said -- or rather implied -- about the homosexuality of Nigel. When David's girlfriend joins them for the tour, his heart sinks because he loves him. I dunno, I've always thought it was becausethey were childhood friends and Nigel doesn't want anyone to take David away from him for friendship reasons. (Although the line \\"We're closer than brothers...\\" makes you wonder.)<br />This mockumentary formula has been re-created time and time again since \\"This is Spinal Tap,\\" even in films such as \\"The Blair Witch Project.\\"<br />But the mockumentary style has been mimicked particularly by Guest, who starred in -- and directed -- \\"Waiting for Guffman,\\" \\"Best in Show,\\" and most recently, 2003's \\"A Mighty Wind.\\" Michael McKean and Harry Shearer returned for these entries, and I'm thinking that the next film should be a collaborative effort, and should reunite everyone from \\"Spinal Tap\\" for a 20-year anniversary -- Reiner, Guest, McKean, Shearer, the cast from Guest's mockumentaries, and perhaps even Crystal and Kirby, et al., in cameos. I'm sure more than a few people would go to see it. And, unlike so many other films, it is one that actually deserves a sequel. And probably one that would be just as funny as the first. And one that would have a purpose, other than being just another cash-in. Anyone interested in what happened to the band members twenty years after their downfall? I know I do.<br />But this is getting off the point, and the point is that none of these Guest mockumentaries -- as good as they are -- come close to the pure greatness of \\"This is Spinal Tap,\\" and \\"A Mighty Wind\\" -- although funny -- started to show signs of formula aging. But \\"This is Spinal Tap\\" was, is, and always shall be, the granddaddy of the mockumentaries. It's the \\"Psycho\\" of mockumentaries, and actually a lot of \\"regular\\" comedies, too.
B00008PW2D|3.0|I am an avid fan who owns season 1-4, however, I refuse to purchase season 5 for the list price.  How can you go from 18 shows in season 4 to 8 shows in season 5 and still charge the same amount?  That's ridiculous!  I'll tape the reruns!!
B0000VAFO0|2.0|....Oops!!  I accidently purchased the fullscreen edition dvd of &quot;Underworld&quot; instead of the widescreen edition (actually the store where I purchased the dvd from only sold the fullscreen editions, and I didn't pay much attention to it, I was just so excited about finally purchasing the dvd, my mistake). Unfortunately, the fullscreen edition is a mere shadow of it's theatrical counterpart. Everything on screen looks so blown up, it's a hassle to decipher what's going on throughout the entire movie!  This may not seem like a big deal to those who are used to watching fullscreen films, but to those who aren't (and cannot bear to watch them like myself) please do yourself a favor and get the widescreen edition instead, in order to fully enjoy the feel of the movie as to it's theatrical counterpart.  Also, what's with the dvd packaging?  The dvd version of &quot;Underworld&quot; was supposed to contain two dvd's and a music soundtrack to the film, and when it arrives it only comes with the single movie dvd.  That's just plain laziness.
B00000099Y|5.0|Alright, first thing's first. Tool is the greatest band out there is. I have no favorite album. Each affects me in a different way. I listen to each at different points in my life. The reason I am writing this review, is to say to everyone to stop comparing Tool to Metallica. I understand comparisons to Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, etc. but Metallica and Tool are on two completely different playing grounds. Tool is math rock, meticulously created by the band, with specific time signature changes, certain rhythms and so on. Metallica is just a hard rock band...who in my opinion are over rated to say the least. Anyways, I recommend Tool to anyone who appreciates extremely talented musicians putting their hearts and souls into making moving and life-changing music. And once you hear Maynard's voice...there's no turning back.
B00004RFFS|3.0|I'm not going to bother telling you about the storyline. You've probably heard it already...<br />Overall, I thought that this was a nice take on Anne Rice's novel itself. Like most fans, I was a bit wary of the cast, especially when I heard that Antonio Bandaras was cast as Armand. Not that I don't like him, but doesn't the vampire have auburn hair with cherub-like features? Sorry, but Antonio just didn't cut it for me. He was better in Zorro.<br />As for the other actors, I thought they played their parts quite respectively. Tom Cruise was indeed bratty as Lestat, and I was quite surprised to see Brad Pitt play such a whiny and sympathetic Louis. Ah, don't get me wrong. I loved Louis in the book. Claudia? For a child actress (during the time it was filmed) I thought Kristin Dunst did pretty well for herself. What I wished to see though was the side of Claudia that was truly evil. Oh yes, the movie-goers understand her plight and all, but what they didn't see was how EVIL that little vixen could be, and how she brought on the destruction of Lestat (and Louis in a manner of speaking). Such an endearing child, isn't she?<br />This vampire flick shouldn't exactly be called horror, though. Fans of Anne Rice should understand that Hollywood WILL change certain passages to satisfy the theatre audiences. (Yes, I'm referring to the ending sequence of the movie, the one where Lestat is in the car.) I was quite upset with that part as well.<br />My personal opinion? I liked both the book and the movie. Both are quite excellent in their own manner. But first, read the book then watch the movie. Then enjoy yourself as you sit back, relax, and watch Claudia pull out her hair again.
0441172717|5.0|normally i either hate science fiction or i kind of like it, but this book Dune i LOVE! this book is about the great Paul Atredies (before he became the Kwisatch Haderac) going to the planet Arakis with his family since his Dad just got assigned a position as emporer of the planet, but through out the story you see Baron Harkonen attack the planet and Paul and his Mom have to run off to avoid being captured. and you see Paul meet a variety of new characters and challenges, and he meets the love of his life who is one of the freeman. And this is the book that began the wonderful series that followed it! this is one of the best books i have ever read, and i recomend it to all people who love fantasy! A MUST HAVE
B0000VAFNQ|2.0|&quot;Underworld&quot; is a film that rips of from the genre of films like &quot;The Crow,&quot; &quot;Dark City,&quot; and &quot;Blade.&quot; It has all the style, effects, and cinematography of these films with nothing new to offer. The plot and acting is completely predictable and contrived. I didn't check out the bonus material because watching this film was already too much of a waste of time. &quot;Underworld&quot; somewhat reminded me of(atleast as far as subject content) two great Japanese anime films called &quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot; and Vampire Hunter D-Bloodlust&quot; which I highly recommend instead of this film. I also recommend seeing &quot;Dark City,&quot; which was the best film to come out of this genre. Even though I didn't like &quot;The Crow&quot; and &quot;Blade,&quot; I recommend them above &quot;Underworld.&quot;
0812550757|4.0|I really enjoyed Ender's Game, so when I picked up speaker of the dead, I expected it to be something along the same vein. Well, you can imagine my disappointment, when, instead of a military-themed story set in space, we get a 'murder mystery' and a 'Christ-like' Ender Wiggin out to redeem everyone whether they like it or not. Ech.<br />The plot centers around the mysterious Piggies, and their strange habit of murdering people in a really gruesome manner.  (I can't imagine how any true anthropologist could find this mystery all that surprising). Ender is called to witness the death of one of the science team, and finds himself embroiled in an almost ridiculously complicated melodrama involving a scientist, her deceased abusive hubbie and her bastard children.<br />While I did enjoy Speaker of the dead, the psychobabble, self-loathing (on most most noticeably Ender and Noviniah), got tiresome. I also disliked that Ender Wiggin's transformed (in between books) into the Doctor Laura of the star waves. This was seriously annoying. Wiggin, the master of 'tough love' decides what's best for everyone, whether they like it or not.<br />Erk. What if Ender is wrong? But of course he NEVER is.<br />A good book, despite the flaws, I've mentioned. However, I personally could have done without the psychobabble and soapboxing.
B0000TAZBK|5.0|I just got this set yesterday and I've spent all morning listening to the soundtracks with my headphones - and they're simply brilliant!<br />The music, mostly composed and conducted by Howard Shore is breathtaking. It would still be magnificent if it stood alone by itself, but as you listen to it, images from the films come back to you and the experience is amplified. These melodies are truly one of the vital elements that have made this cinematic trilogy the masterpiece that it is.<br />The only problem I have with this set is that the soundtracks are for the theater versions of the films, no the extended editions that have appeared on the DVDs - thus, a great deal of additional music is missing (like the funeral song sung by Eowyn in The Two Towers).<br />As for the packaging, it's a simple, elegant yellowish tan box that holds all three CDs and 18 picture cards with most of the characters from the films, which are nice to have.<br />This is an extraordinary piece of music that you shouldn't miss, and part of the best movie experience of our generation.<br />...as a coda, Howard Shore writes in the notes from The Return of the King CD &quot;and, of course, one holds the dream of a Hobbit's tale&quot;...me too, Howard. Me too.
B0000029DD|5.0|purchasing this cd, i had not heard anything off of it. i had heard great things about it for years. i finally decided to get it at borders, because it was on sale for 7 dollars. when i got home and put it in my cd player, i sat there and let the music flow through my soul. the whole overall feel of the album makes it quite the disturbing, but beautiful experience i get every time i listen to it. the songs go into your mind and make you basically float away, even make you feel a sort of melancholy religious experience. the tragedy that happened makes this album even more disturbing. when you put it in you will feel like buckleys soul is in the room with you, singing these songs in front of you. the only song i can really say something about is hallelujah. after first listening, i felt a sort of sadness, and sorrow come over me. jeff sounds so alone, and alienated in this song. its basically him with and clean electric guitar, and his beautiful voice sweeping over everything. this song will disturb you to a great extent the first time you hear it. in time you will feel more comfort while listening to it. the rest of the songs on this cd sound like you're floating through the ocean, and eventually winding up at a church. its a feeling that words can't describe. this album must be owned by any type of music fan. its an amazing experience.
B00005QK39|5.0|Ah, Marillion's first album! It's been over 20 years since this record came out, and it hasn't lost any of its musical greatness. The band, originally formed as an instrumental group but later adding singer/lyricist/stage personality Fish, rounded a fine group of pieces for their first outing (other than the Market Square Heroes stand alone single released a few months earlier).<br />Very much in the vein of Genesis' greatest symphonic years, A script for a jester's tear is a finely written, performed and produced set of music. Starting off with the title track, a lament of mental illness and depression, followed by the paranoia driven He knows you knows, this album has some of the greatest symphonic prog rock of the 80's (and then some). The record continues with The Web, followed by the lighthearted Garden party, a parody of the british high society reunions. Then comes the dark Chelsea monday about a female suicide. And perhaps leaving the best to last, the album closes with the almost epic (not quite 10 minutes long) Forgotten sons, the anti-war anthem of the band. This record is theatrically dark.<br />This remastered version, as well as sounding much better than the previous release, includes a second CD containing the bands singles from that era, including two versions of the afore mentioned Market Square Heroes, as well as the truly epic (not only in length!) Grendel. A perfect companion and a great complement for the original CD (although all this tracks can be found in slightly different versions in the B'sides themselves album, along with the live version of Margaret and a few other tracks).<br />As a side note, this is the only record of the band that doesn't feature Ian Mosley on drums, instead having Mick Pointer on skins.
B000089RVR|5.0|&quot;Life For Rent&quot; is Dido's follow-up album of &quot;No Angel&quot;.  She combines pop, synthesizer, and celtic to create a highly unique sound that pleases audiences.  Such musical quality raises her level from her previous efforts.  Her lyrics are written and performed beautifully regardless if she's singing about love, loneliness, or intimacy.  Her voice offers a shy, yet deep glimpse into her words and personal life.  Whether she's singing with an upbeat or a ballad tempo, she remains flawless.  <br />She offers a wonderful variety of musical flavors throughout the album.  Her Grammy-nominated hit single &quot;White Flag&quot; is a great way to begin this musical journey, which expresses her pop background.  This introduces what's to come throughout the remainder.  Her signature musical combination sometimes adds other musical elements, making her tracks more interesting.  &quot;Stoned&quot; stands out the most in such experimentation, adding eerie and techno elements.  Her ballads offer an orchestrated theme, making her words deeper and more meaningful.<br />With most of mainstream music sounding the same, it's great that Dido continues doing her own thing.  Radio needs more like her.  &quot;Life For Rent&quot; is a great album for those looking for unique music.  This will become an unforgettable experience for many and in some cases, addictive.  Dido is expected to receive some 2004 Grammy nominations, including Best Pop Album and possibly Album of the Year, which are highly deserved.
B00006RIO7|5.0|Just now got around to seeing the movie.  Loved every bit of it!<br />The soundtrack is awesome.  The singing is outstanding and the musicians wonderfully capture the style of the early jazz era. Their playing is superb. The last two tracks are very good too.  Most reviewers hate them, and while I agree that they don't fit the theme of the rest of the music, they are wonderful performances on their own.
B000088E6D|5.0|Mr. Bublé has an extraordinary vocal talent. His sound is intoxicating, and his performance brilliant.<br />From the powerful portions of Sway or Fever or How can you Mend a Broken Heart, to the soft and sweet That's All, his voice leaves you wanting more more more. It's incredibly pure..<br />My opinion of his concerts is even higher than for this cd (if that's possible!) as he sounded as good, or better live, which in this day and age is incredible in itself, and his persona / stage presence is unlike ANY of todays' performers - he's so natural, fluid, funny and downright electric. He signed all our autographs after the sell out show, and his sincerity and appreciation for all of us who waited for him was not rehearsed. You could see he was exhausted but wanting so show his fans that they mattered to him. It makes him unique!<BR>When asked about a next cd, he said 'soon' - can't wait!<br />Mr. Bublé has a most brilliant future - make the discovery now!
B00005JMSE|5.0|Of course I have not yet seen the film so I can't really say this movie is awesome and such. But putting the peices together from A. The Trailer B. The Comics and C. the Director all of these things that factor in and give this film tremendous potential. The title character looks AWESOME, especially since he is not full CGI. The Director Mr. Del Toro knows his stuff and after doing Blade 2 I am confident he has his facts straight as far as comic book adaptions go. And if you lok back at the original source material for Hellboy(the comics), then we have a pretty epic fun ride of a film ahead of us.
B0000CFW87|4.0|I was somewhat disspaointed when I first listened to Closer. His first album was so phenominal I was wondering where he could go from there but I am beginning to love the songs now. I still feel Josh is at his best when he sings the classical songs. I noticed he is pitiching higher in some songs now and his vocal range is broadening. I hope he is not going to lean more towards pop in the future.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I hated the theatrical version of TTT for a number of reasons, the most important of which was that although the film sort of followed the general outlines of Tolkien's work, the writers had disgarded everything that made the book worthwhile in order to impose a ridiculous amount of screenwriterly conflict. For example, having the Ents reject war with Saruman is bad enough, but to have Eomer exiled wrecks the development of his relationship with Aragorn, and finally, to turn Faramir into a callow jerk in order to put some threat at the end of the film was to me a crime beyond forgiveness.<br />This extended version, however, is a whole new film, and one that I found myself admiring.  There are new scenes and extended scenes that give us more of the actual story and allow the characters to breathe in this massive space. My dislike of Faramir's character was lessened by inclusion of much of his backstory, particularly his love for his brother Boromir and his inability to please his father.  Additional scenes at the end of sequence with Sam and Frodo bring this character, despite the changes in the screenplay, closer to the original character.<br />Deadlines had a lot to do with why New Line didn't release these versions instead of the chopped up versions that made it into most theaters - most films are designed to sell popcorn, and I guess a film this long would limit sales of Milk Duds and Diet Coke - and TTT also had to be in theaters for Xmas release.<br />The last thing I ever thought I'd be doing was giving The Two Towers a five-star rating, but since I've seen the extended version, I must do just that.
B00004XOWM|5.0|This is a great CD. I don't know why people are giving it bad reviews and why some people are trying to analyze it. You don't analyze it, you just listen to it and enjoy it.<BR>If you don't mind cussin' (but if you do then you shouldn't be listing to Limp Bizkit) then you should listen to Hotdog, it has a good beat to it and it will be stuck in your head for a while. Another good song on here is Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle). There aren't very many bad songs on this CD despite what others might say. So, if you are a fan of Limp Bizkit, this is a must for you.
B0000028RR|5.0|If I were you i would buy the RAGE cd's in opposite order, if you even bother with Renegades.  Although this album came out first, it is definatly the most amazing of all of them, its lyrics are so powerful if you take the time to actually listen to them, specifically Bullet to the Head.  I like also how this album has a bit more of the southern-california feel to it in the guitar and the beats.  I do not want to explain this album to the readers of this review because you need to buy it yourself and analyze every bit of this masterpiece; it is meant to discover for yourself and absorb their message.
6302886228|5.0|Let me just add my voice to the chorus of pleas for the 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration to be issued on DVD.  I came ready to buy the DVD at any price and was shocked to find out it has never been issued.  SONY - you are losing money.  I'm pretty sure that's not part of your mission statement.  Put this thing out, PLEASE!!!.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|I've only been a casual fan of Daft Punk, but thought it was worth checking out...and I loved it! It's thoroughly entertaining for any fan of Daft Punk and/or Leiji Matsumoto; and pretty impressive considering it would've had to be released for arts sake and not to make a million bucks.  The story is about an alien rock group kidnapped and brought to Earth by an evil music manager, with the music from Discovery, and no dialogue. I didn't really understand the story until the second time I watched it, though.
B000002HMH|4.0|First off, I'd like to thank Metallica for getting me into metal(a black man who loves hip hop; I've beem a metal fan for 12 years, like most people, because of the highly catchy and energetic Black album. I think their first four albums are the best music in general has to offfer; I will put up against any four albums of some of the greatest artists of all time(The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, etc.) After listening to the mediocre St.Anger(return to glory, my ass!), I've developed a new apperciation for their sixth album, Load. The first of the Load series, with it's sister album Reload released the following year,was once again a left turn from the thrash free for alls that made them famous. When I saw the \\"Untl It Sleeps\\" video on MTV, I was thrown off like all of you were;Metallica playing even slower than on The Black Album, and apparently they've been made over by the Queer Eye For The Straight Guy posse! But once I bought the album, I pushed all that to the wayside.<br />Did they sell out? Yes; actually they sold out with the Black Album, so it should be no suprise to anyone. Look at the rock scene in 1996; groups like the Smashing Pumpkins, Silverchair, No Doubt, R.E.M, Bush, Blur and Green Day were leading the alternative-post grunge revolution; if Metallica hade made another pure thrash album or even another Black album, they would have been musically irrelevant, much like the sound of St. Anger, which caters to the nu-metal crowd. However, Load is a magical album that is very well written,well played and is the best Metallica album of the 1990's; had they taken the best from Load and Reload and put them on one album, it would have been one of the top 10 of the 90's. It is a great mix of blues, jazz, country, alternative/grunge, southern rock and boogie. The \\"Hero Of The Day\\" on this album would have to be Jason Newsted; as you may or may not know, most traditional \\"black\\" music(blues, jazz, R&B, hiphop, etc)relies working off the bass grove, Jason lays down some of the best I've ever heard! Obviously he was making up for his absence on And Justice For All.<BR>The aforementioned \\"Until It Sleeps\\". Bleeding Me\\", \\"The Outlaw Torn\\", \\"Hero Of The Day\\" and the country ballad \\"Mama Said\\" are my favorite tracks; while there are great songs on this album, there are some I've could have done without, like Cure and Ronnie.
B000092ZYX|5.0|This is by far the Pinnacle of Radiohead's creativity, and the band really hits their stride with their 6th album. This release contains the best characteristics of every one of their previous albums, thrown into a blender and turned on HIGH. Brilliantly mixing the raw emotion of Pablo Honey, the songwriting technique of The Bends, the grandiose etherealism of OK Computer, the beautiful electronics of Kid A and the sonic depression of Amnesiac, Hail to the Theif is truely a gem in a somewhat lacking current music scene, as is Radiohead. They have attainted the rareified &quot; gaining a mainstream fanbase while totally doing whatever the hell they want&quot; territory, excelling in experimentation while still being able to achieve popularity in success. That speaks wonders for a band. This cd definetely needs to be listened to with headphones, from the sonic assault of &quot;2+2= 5&quot;, the haunting soundscapes of &quot; We Such Young Blood&quot; and &quot;The Gloaming&quot;, the damn-near funky basslines of &quot;I Will&quot;, the downright danceable beat on one of the albums best tunes, &quot;Myxamatosis&quot;, and all throughout the album. &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; is absolutely mindblowing in both a musical and lyrical sense, and it is by far Radioheads most eclectic cd, drawing equally from electronica, alternative, funk, soul, brit pop and rock to create a truely mind-bending experience. Listening to this cd will make you re-evaluate the way you judge all music you listen to in the future and totally, totally solidifies Radiohead's ubiquitous prescence in the current music scene. For those waiting for a worthy followup to OK Computer, this is it, and in my opinion it blows the afforementioned album completely out of the water.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Disc One contains the complete tribute concert, uncut and unedited. Disc Two includes the edited theatrical version, plus some bonus rehearsal footage and interviews.  Every phase of George's career is covered.  Eric Clapton organized the concert and turned in brilliant performances of the songs \\"If I Needed Someone\\" and \\"Beware Of Darkness.\\"  I especially enjoyed Gary Brooker, lead singer of Procol Harum, doing the Beatles' era song \\"Old Brown Shoe.\\"  His outstanding performance was not in the theatrical version, although the song is heard over the closing credits.  Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers performed the Beatles' songs \\"Taxman\\" and \\"I Need You.\\"  Jeff Lynne joined them to perform the Traveling Wilburys' song \\"Handle With Care.\\"  It's too bad Bob Dylan wasn't able to be there.  Not only is he the other surviving member of the Traveling Wilburys, Bob also participated in George Harrison's 1971 \\"Concert For Bangla Desh.\\"    Ringo Starr remained upbeat while mentioning how the meaning changed of the song \\"Photograph,\\" which he wrote with the late George Harrison.  \\"But all I've got is a photograph, and I realize you're not coming back anymore.\\"  Ringo then launched into a spirited version of the Carl Perkins' classic \\"Honey Don't.\\"  Paul McCartney followed with the Beatles' era song \\"For You Blue.\\"  Paul started the George Harrison song \\"Something\\" on the ukulele, before Eric Clapton and the band joined in for an electrifying finish to that song.  Paul and Eric also did a duet on the classic song \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps.\\"  That was followed by Billy Preston sweetly singing \\"My Sweet Lord.\\"  The excitement level really built up in the next to last song, \\"Wah Wah,\\" performed by almost all of the participating musicians.  Amazingly, that song wasn't even included in the theatrical version of the concert.  Joe Brown, an English singer also managed by Brian Epstein back in the sixties, joined everybody to sing a moving version of the final song, \\"I'll See You In My Dreams.\\"  It was a fitting farewell to the late, great George Harrison.
B000068QY7|5.0|Yes, the Gallagher brothers seem to risk a little irony-free sunshine on &quot;She Is Love&quot; and &quot;Songbird,&quot; both very sweet songs. &quot;Little By Little&quot; and &quot;Stop Crying Your Heart Out&quot; are classic Oasis ballads reminiscent of &quot;Don't Look Back In Anger&quot; and &quot;Don't Go Away.&quot; I enjoy Noel's vocals on some of the songs- gives em a different sound than Liam's. Both are great singers but each contribute a different vibe to the individual song. &quot;Hung In A Bad Place&quot; and &quot;Better Man&quot; have some great guitar riffs. It's just a great album all around, second only to &quot;What's The Story (Morning Glory)&quot; (which, if you're a new Oasis fan, you HAVE to get!).
0375414932|5.0|I have been a William Boyd fan since reading &quot;Brazzaville Beach&quot; (one of my favorite books) many years ago.  I think this book is his best work yet.  Following Logan Mountstuart's life through his diaries I found myself disliking him at times but yet always appreciating his honesty... and always enjoying his adventures.  A page turner from the beginning, I cried at times and was truly sad to finish the book.  Fabulous!
B0000C7PSW|5.0|I've been excited for this album for some time, and was not let down in the least. The entire disc is beautiful, right now I'm drawn to these songs, so I'll just write about those, (but do not over look &quot;Pretty Things&quot;, &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot; or any of the others, it's a solid disc)<br />&quot;Oh What A World&quot; kicks off the disc in true Wainwright fashion. Simple lyrics backed by Rufus on the ivories and a lovely orchestra with some wonderful brass lines.<br />That leads nicely into the first song I heard on the radio &quot;I Don't Know What It Is.&quot; It starts off slow and builds with all the charm that I love the entire disc for until finally coming to the kind of climactic romp only Wainright could create.<br />So far my favourite is the epic &quot;Go or Go Ahead&quot; again starts slow but builds to a beautiful climax.<br />&quot;Harvester of Hearts&quot; is another beautiful piece. &quot;Not that I have that much to offer, God knows I have so much to gain.&quot; is my favourite line from the disc showing that Rufus is really maturing.<br />And that is really what I like about this album. Rufus is really proving himself here, he's not just riding on the coattails of his parents. The orchestration is beautiful and this is some of his best songwriting to date. I'm really looking forward to &quot;Want Two.&quot;
B00005K9QP|2.0|One of the first blues records I heard (on vinyl), I quickly outgrew it when exposed to many of originals that are covered here. This album is celebrated because of Clapton's guitar work yet saddled with a mediocre band including Mayall's rather uninspiring singing and playing.  Only one who has been exposed to only a smattering of blues would ever suggest such nonsense that this is among the greatest two or three blues albums.  On what basis is this album is more of a must than a collection of Freddie King's Federal Recordings or Otis Rush's Cobra recordings or Elmore James' Fire Recordings or Memphis Slim's United/States and Vee-Jay recordings with Matt 'Guitar' Murphy's guitar not to mention other artists (Johnny 'Guitar' Watson, Albert King, Guitar Slim, etc.).  If this record leads you to the real blues geniuses fine, but the notion that this is an indispensable 'blues' disc is ludicrous.  Blues is primarily a vocal music, and on that basis this is not a memorable blues album.
B000002BBY|4.0|I can't honestly say that I am a fan of Oasis. I always found the Gallagher brothers boorish and conceited beyond belief. They make real estate tycoon Donald Trump seem modest and humble by their standards. Still the brothers managed to churn out some really catchy rock and roll songs. The songs that I do like from the band is from their smash hit \\"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\\".  It was hard not to like songs such as \\"Wonderwall\\" and \\"Champagne Supernova\\" but for me the Beatle-esque \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\" was really made me buy the cd. I just love the harmonies of the Gallagher brothers and the infectious melodies. Other than the well known singles, I really dug the first two opening songs \\"Hello\\" and \\"Roll With It\\", especially the latter song. The production quality is simply stellar. The Gallagher brothers definitely captured the sound that they wanted with this album. The production is simply pristine and uncluttered by overdubs. Despite having the personalities of an angry wolverine and badger, the Gallagher brothers produced a brilliantly wonderful album that is known as \\"(What's the Story)Morning Glory?\\". My only fault with the album is with the lengthiness of \\"Champagne Supernova\\". Nothing bores me more than a 11 minute long, bloated rock song. It's too bad their boorish personalities and run-ins with the British tabloids led to the band's declining fall after this excellent album.
B0000TB01Y|3.0|The good is the performances by the leads.<BR>The bad is the lack of a synopsis so that the songs can be understood within the the libretto.<BR>The mediocre is the songs themselves. Schwartz has never been my favorite composer, but he has privided some excellent music, particularly for Children of Eden and Rags. Even Godspell and Pippin had their moments. Unhappily, those moments are very rare in Wicked.
0446530891|2.0|Baldacci seemed to have found the perfect mix of character/plot and action in his novels but this book has none of the usual characteristics that one would associate with the author.  If his name was not on the cover you would not have guessed that it was him!<br />Weak characters and a story that had potential and ends up being quite dull with an ending that is almost laughable.<br />Sorry, but is is a bad one from a normally reliable and top notch author.
0316666343|5.0|This book is breathtakingly beautiful in it's conception and writing.  It is one of the best books that I have ever read.  Alice Seybold connects with both the living and the dead to bring a poignant story of a young girl slain before she could ever experience the joys of life completely.  Yet it doesn't bring you down the way that some books do about such grim subjects.  It is uplifting and hopeful despite the sad situtation of the lead character Susie.  Highly recommended.
0754007979|5.0|Maurice Castle is working for the Secret Service. In this bizarre profession, he has to deal with leaks, security checks, tensions and suspicions. As Maurice approaches retirement, he realises that some of the decisions he made in the past are now having very serious consequences. In this beautiful novel, the reader discovers what the life of a secret agent is like: he is lonely, isolated and becomes almost neurotic. Greene lays bare a machine, the Secret Service, which overlooks Maurice's subtle and secret motivations that impel him. The characters are beautiful, full of tenderness, excitement and doubt.   Mr Tim Pigott-Smith's performance as a reader of Graham Greene's &quot;The Human Factor&quot; in this audiobook is truly stunning. His voice is very pleasant and his vivid reading adds a further dimension to this already excellent novel.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I basically look at any movie, once it can show me that it does not have a predictable storyline in contrast to a 'unique' storyline. Being critical and scrutinizing certain movies are ineveitable. Every single mistake that any particular director makes is always sought out by professional movie critics. And then there are the director's and producer's who make an absolutely spectacular film...ones that leave you in awe...ones that you see in the cinema and come out with your jaw wenched open...those are the movies that stay with you till the ends of time... <BR>I'm a huge Lord of the Rings fan...i mean who isn't? The skill of Peter Jackson in bringing this movie to life from J.R.R Tolkein's amazing and spectacular book is unbelieveable and almost non-human. I was not disspointed by any of his movies in the triology...they all did justice to Tolkein's books... <BR>I don't think I have anything else to say about any other movies presently...Lord of the Rings dominates my mind and thoughts right now...anyone with a different perspective please feel free to send me an e-mail. <BR>&quot;I have no particular talent. I am merely inquisitive.&quot; - Albert Einstein

B00005JMFO|5.0|\\"Love Actually\\" is grand, actually.<br />\\"When the planes hit the Twin Towers, as far as I know, none of the phone calls from the people on board were messages of hate or revenge - they were all messages of love.\\"<BR>-Hugh Grant (as Prime Minister) during opening credits of Film<br />the quote above is just one of the many things i loved about this film...when i went and saw \\"Love Actually\\" (Friday--the day it opened), I had two expectations in mind. One: it would be just as good as i thought it would be, if not better. Two: it...just...wouldn't. haha Well, thankfully, my first hope was fulfilled. \\"Love Actually\\" is grand...need I say more?<br />But I will.<br />The movie--soo good, wildly entertaining, extremely funny, heart-warming, and charming...very romantic...i fell in love with a certain handsome character (Rodrigo Santoro who plays Karl)...mama mia!!! ;-) hehehe. When I went to the first showing at the box office, the lady behind me asked me what the movie was all about. I only had to say but two words, and she was convinced. Is that not cool, or what? ;-) <br />i recommend this movie immensely! it is so funny...(one of my favorite parts is the spectacle of Hugh Grant dancing through and about his house...too, too adorable. :o) his moves...man oh man...maybe one of the best dance sequences I have ever scene...I mean, what is better than spontaneity when it comes to groovin'? not much. hehe Hugh Grant...boy...he could charm the boots off of anyone. :o) yes, even if through some mumbling, uncool bumblin) I also loved it when Liam Neeson had that \\"serious\\" talk with his stepson Sam, whom he thought was having trouble dealing with his mother's death when \\"actually\\" his depressed mood was due to his passionate and painful unrequited love for a slightly older America pop star. The eight or nine-year-old boy was so serious when he told Daniel (Neeson) that he wasn't too young to be in love...that, too, is so incredibly cute. =) <br />This movie will have you laughing at every point of the film. ok, well except for the really touching, tender moments like when Laura Linney goes to visit her brother in a pyschiatric hospital--her brother, who during Laura's last visit tries to strike her, but this time throws his manly arms around her and hugs her tightly--is the forgiving spirit of Christmas at work here? maybe...you could go ahead and infer that. This random act of love may bring tears to your eyes, but of course some might be a little irked that in order for her to tend to her brother she had to forfeit her newly-begun relationship with the really tall, dark, and handsome Brazilian Rodrigo Santoro. tut tut tut. What a shame...they never did bring complete closure to what went on between the two. That's maybe the one thing I disliked about the film. the ONE. haha...in other words, everything else was wonderful. hehe <br />And then there's the really sweet, romantic aspects of the film that will bring some, like my friend Kim, literally to tears. Who knows? Some people cry at weddings. Others, like me, cry at funerals. Who knows why really...who knows why.....<br />the characters are just too hilarious, too sweet, and too cute or cool or just so undeniably hot that you can't NOT like 'em. u kno whadda i mean? they're jus lovable characters, and you and your subconscious suddenly find yourselves relating to them because you or someone you know has been in the same or a very similar predicament as the characters brought to life on screen. The presence of Christmas was never overlooked. =) Well, ok, maybe that is truly obvious because the holdiay was the underlying theme of \\"Love Actually\\", but all shrewdness aside, the warm, fuzzy spirit gets you in such a way that you feel like leaping out of your seat, jumping up into the screen, and hugging every single person in the movie. Hmmm...seriously now, what more can I ask for in a movie? A brilliant cast, a story set in the most celebrated, highly favored holiday of the year...the stars speaking in the most beloved accent of them all (English)...handsome, but humble men (who really don't take themselves too seriously), pretty but adorable ladies (ladies who seem to forget just how lovely they really are) and the cutest boy (Sam played by Thomas Sangster) you have ever laid eyes upon; and I mean, EVER. :D<br />Love Actually has it all. And the great part about it is, it's not just exclusive romantic love that is celebrated. You have several forms....maybe even the most essential kinds--the love of a family, the love between a mother and daughter, stepfather and son, friend and friend, but most of all, the love of a community...a community joined for a single purpose: to present to the world a love that consumes and touches all.<br />I wanted to see \\"Elf\\" the same Friday Love came out, but since it was already late in the evening, I only had time to see one, so of course, I, being the Christmas-loving, romance fanatic that I am, chose the movie that has those similar aspects of humor and Christmas as I am sure is seen in \\"Elf\\", but with that added, much endorsed instance of love's beauty. Love is actually the greatest thing on earth, and \\"Love Actually\\", well...attempts to show the most dear and great things about it. I must say, the makers of \\"Notting Hill\\" and \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" succeeded in doing just that. (pip pip! cheers!!)<br />So throw away your cynicism and lame opposition to anything and everything that has to do with the entirely human emotion of love, and do yourself and every other cynic out there a favor...just see the movie!! You won't regret it. =)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|And in my top 5 of all time. I couldn't believe how awesome the show was after actually seeing the pilot (which Fox decided wasn't exciting enough), and seeing all of the episodes in the correct order. There are only two episodes in the fourteen that are not incredible, and those two standouts still rate higher than most of the &quot;quality programming&quot; gracing our airwaves. Buy the set, share it with your friends, and help bring back what should have been a television milestone!
1565123875|5.0|I was in Barnes &amp; Noble and was walking past the new fiction section and just happened to pick up this book.  It wasn't on sale and I had never heard anything about it nor had I heard of the author.  So I took a chance and decided to go ahead and pay full price (which I never do)! Suffice it to say, I have not been disappointed.  This book is sooooo good.  It's a slow, mystical kind of read.  It's also shocking, lyrical, and very enlightening.  There's one scene, when Kambili goes upstairs to the bathroom to see what her father wants with her, and I was totally caught off guard.  I will be recommending this novel to all of my friends, family, and of course, my book club.  For anyone who is a parent, I would definitely recommend this book.  I hope to one day meet the author.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|There is no album that came out last year that can come close to this. Then again last year wasn't much to speak about, but still, this album is above and beyond anything released. Never have a I bought an album and listened to it as much as I have when I put this on by CD player. There are 3 songs in particular that just grab you and won't let you go. Weak and Powerless, The Noose &amp; Gravity. Very thought provoking songs and just outstanding musically. &quot;I choose to live.&quot;
6305127689|5.0|Top Gun is, by far, the best movie I have ever seen.  There is no movie that comes close to it.  I have watched it about 100 times and it gets better and better everytime.

I own 11 out of his 24 movies on DVD and waiting for The Last Samarui to come out on DVD because that is now my 2nd favorite movie.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|In The Zone is the #1 album in the country. I love all of Britney's albums. Britney is my favorite singer and always has been. I love all the songs on In The Zone (especially 'Toxic' and 'Boom Boom'). For all u Britney haters out there y'all r just jeaulous or something bcuz u judge her like she's not even a human being. You say that she wears almost no clothes and is that any of YOUR business....NO! Christina, Beyonce, Pink, Lil' Kim, J.Lo where just as much clothes and I don't see ppl picking on them. U ppl disgust me. You don't even know her so back off. Britney IS NOT a dumb blonde cuz if she was, then she wouldn't be the superstar that she is today. The girl works hard and is committed to what she does. <BR>I must admit that when I heard 'Me Against the Music' i wasn't as thrilled as before but when I bought the album and listened to the songs --- they were VERY GOOD! Give Britney a change and buy her album. The songs are really good to dance to i luv it.
B00005JMCW|3.0|\\"Freaky Friday\\" is a fun, high-spirited remake of the 1976 film of the same name, which served as ground zero for the body-switch movie craze of the 1980's.<br />Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Loman are terrific as the mother and daughter who don't see eye-to-eye on too many things, least of all how the other should be living her life.  But when a freak \\"accident\\" befalls them, causing each of them to wind up in the other's body, both are forced to see things from the other person's perspective.  This sort of one-joke setup could easily have resulted in a mechanical, manufactured comedy, but writers Heather Hach and Leslie Dixon, along with director Mark Waters, have decided to have some real fun with the premise by devising clever scenarios that bend the mind a little and by building a surprising amount of depth into the two lead characters.  We learn quite a bit about how each generation views the other in the course of all the highflying antics.<br />This film is a real tour de force for the two actresses, especially Curtis, who never falters for a moment in her characterization of a bratty teenager trapped in a middle-aged woman's body.  Loman has the less challenging - and less fun - job of portraying her opposite number, but she still delivers a performance of tremendous charm and substance.<br />\\"Freaky Friday\\" may not be original, but it provides more laugh-out-loud moments than virtually any comedy released in 2003.
B00005JMFR|4.0|Some people I just don't understand. Yes the 1st Matrix Film was good, but the sequels had alot more of a plot to them. So many people loved the first film and thought it was the best movie they ever saw. But then everyone critizes the sequels and literally turn agianst what they once thought was fantastic. I for one enjoyed the entire Trilogy. The ending to Revoultions was disapointing, I'll admit that. But, I feel that maybe, just maybe in a few years down the road there may be more to this story then we all think. The Matrix is the best Sci-Fi Trilogy I have ever witnessed. As the Program 'Smith' once said, \\"It's not over.\\"
0792163710|3.0|SHANE is a great film, but this DVD doesn't quite present it correctly. Paramount released SHANE in 1953. Its intended projection aspect ratio was 1.66:1 (coincidentally the European widescreen cinema aspect ratio; and, very close to our current video favorite, 16:9). Check out this article: [...]<BR>I haven't watched this DVD carefully enough (I don't enjoy the crop-job, and prefer my memory of seeing it in the theatre) to determine if it was panned/scanned or centered to eliminate edge material, but it definitely does not present the film in the aspect ratio intended for cinema projection in 1953. <BR>This is a greater shame, because SHANE was at the vanguard pushing cinema screens to the wider ratios we enjoy today.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Bad, bad, and just plain bad.  Does Britney think being provacative... constitutes being mature?  She's sadly mistaken.  There is nothing here that hasn't been done before and done much better.  Britney's extremely limited vocal range seem to diminish even more after each album.  Her squeaky voice is barely audible against the loud beats.  If you like good pop with meaning, heart and an amazing voice to boot, try Christina Aguilera's \\"Stripped\\"  This girl has more talent in her little pinky, than Britney has in her whole silicone body.
B00006JDVV|1.0|The movie sucked. The story line was awful. The actors were ok, but some of them..... no. The movie was way too fake, and like i said early on that the story line made no sense. This is my advise.............. DO NOT GET THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!! waste of money :]
B0000AQVCL|3.0|I really like this album. It's fun and hard edged. Yet it's kind of listening to the Rutles. They've totally nailed some of the sounds of the major bands of the 70s. The problem is that it's SO much like the original band it's scary. If you're familar with the original artists, you can hear some riffs and progressions that one still associates with the original song. As an example, &quot;Look What You've Done&quot; reminds me of &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot; by the Beatles, but there's a disconcerting extra piano phrase just before the vocals would have started. Later, the song sounds like it was influnced by tunes from &quot;Sgt. Peppers&quot;. Very nice song, but it's so familar that it's unsettling.<br />Like they say, &quot;It's like deja vu all over again&quot;.<br />Bottom line: I like the music, but until they can inject some originality, I doubt the next CD they release will be as well received by the public.
B00000AFWW|5.0|I've always believed that Hole was a superior band to Nirvana and I am appalled at the people who believe that CL tagged along on KC's fame -- Hole does not need to because they ROCK.  Celebrity Skin gets just as much praise from me as LTT because both albums convey an amazing dynamic that cannot be duplicated -- Hole should really be credited as lyrical geniuses and I'll take CL screaming any day over Kurt's malcontent whine.  I give CS 5/5 because I bought this album when it came out and I play it ALL the time still. My favourites are 'Petals', 'Boys on the Radio', and 'Playing your song' but really all the songs here are great - I would reccomend this album ANY day and if you EVER get to see CL live - DO IT because U won't regret it! I'm really excited about CL's new album (America's Sweetheart) and I hope it's worth the wait.
B000000993|5.0|Tool is one of the most talented and creative bands of the past ten years, and \\"Undertow\\", their first full-length release, was our first glimpse of their greatness.  While still much more straight-forward than their subsequent releases, \\"Aenima\\" and \\"Lateralus\\", it was a gigantic step forward from their debut EP, \\"Opiate\\".  It's much more intelligent, more sophisticated, more complex.  Plus, the songwriting is just generally better overall.  Basically, it's their first solid effort.<br />Maynard's vocals are a bit rougher around the edges here than on the later stuff.  This material is generally a bit more aggressive than most of what they've done since, so Maynard's smooth, hypnotizing vocal melodies are few and far between.  Instead, he opts for more violent snarls and screams.  Even the more laid-back vocals seem sinister and threatening.  Combined with this, are guitarist Adam Jones's jagged riffage, and bassist Paul D'Amour's thunderous basslines, to create a dark, heavy, menacing atmosphere, which encompasses just about all of the album.  And of course, the monstrous Danny Carey puts on a great performance, with some of his most intense and brutal drumwork to date.<br />My description of the album's uniformly dark and heavy feel may lead you to believe that the album is a bit repetitive.  However, this is not so.  There is plenty of diversity in the music, although it may take a few listens for some to distinguish some of the songs.  From the dark, forlorn \\"Sober\\", to the chunky (but still moody) \\"Prison Sex\\", to the sludgy \\"Swamp Song\\", to the ferocious and complex title track, there are plenty of different shades and textures here.  \\"Bottom\\" is kind of an epic track, with a really cool spoken word part from Henry Rollins, to make a nice contrast to Maynard's vicious vocals.<br />  \\"Disgustipated\\" is probably the hardest thing for most to get into.  After 60+ one-second tracks of silence, this odd 15-minute track creeps from the shadows.  It begins with some odd, noisy instrumentation, some cryptic soundclips (some sort of demented sermon, with farm animal noises in the background), and a few lines of vocals, spat out in kind of a primeval chant.  This is followed by about 10 minutes of cricket noises, and finally another odd spoken word thing at the end.  Other than sitting through the cricket noises (I usually just fast-forward after a minute or so), it's a pretty interesting way to end the album, and a foreshadowing of the weirdness to come.<br />So anyway, this is quite an excellent album.  They would go on to make material that quite simply blows this out of the water, but hey, they had to start somewhere, and in that respect, this is great stuff.  Oh, and in response to the fellow who claimed that the musicianship here is subpar, and can't see how anyone can prefer this to \\"Reign in Blood\\", etc., well, obviously, you were looking for the wrong thing.  Despite the lack of thrashy riffs (well, except maybe for \\"Crawl Away\\") and shredding solos, this is really rhythmically complex stuff, and as much as I love Slayer and the like, it's apples and oranges.  At any rate, everyone should give this a try.  Challenging?  Yes.  Worth passing up?

B0000DD7LB|5.0|In my opinion Britney is the best entertainer in the music business right now. She entertains us with her awesome music which this cd brings. It has mind-blowing and outstanding songs. It also has danceable songs which are really groovy and have awesome beats to it. I think this is the best cd that I've ever purchased. I think Britney will be famous for a really long time just like Madonna. I really love this cd. I read some of the reviews and people keep comparing her to her rival Xtina. But Xtina is too skanky and slutty. Britney has more clothes on then Christina which really shows that britney's smarter and more intellectual than Xtina.  Britney's even more successful than Xtina and Britney appered in the music business before Christina. Anyways Get this album right now cause it rocks!!!!
B000002UAU|2.0|Rating this album as two stars may be heresy to most, but when the hype surrounding this record is stripped, we're left with an album that is no where near the best of the Fab 4's output. Allowances are often made due to the &quot;experimental&quot; nature of this album. How ground-breaking is Sgt. Pepper's, though? Pet Sounds made far more important advances in harmonic structure, and The Velvet Underground and Nico (recorded in 1966 but released in '67) was far more subversive and interesting in its textures and lyrical content. Frankly, this record contains many well-arranged pieces based on the repetition of forgettable melodies.<br />I find it interesting that when musicians are asked for their favorite Beatles Album, it is Revolver and Abbey Road that dominate. Why then do critics and casual listeners consistently rate Sgt. Peppers and The White Album #1? I believe that a lot of the &quot;breakthrough&quot; claims placed on these two albums rely heavily on the general populace's ignorance of lesser-known works that influence many musicians and artists.<br />In my opinion, the Beatles were at their best writing blues-derived pop and rock songs. To be fair, had they not made these &quot;experimental&quot; forays, we'd have had 30-odd years of &quot;Love Me Do&quot; cover bands. That said, the sixties are the nexus from which springs the dichotomy of american popular music-- artistic versus the business model of pop. Give the Beatles credit, they refused to sacrifice the former to the latter. But they did this from the beginning-- the change from pop to art happened not on the production side, but in the reception. Rock was not considered art because it did not conform to European concepts of art music. Sgt. Pepper's married strands of traditional European styles to the base of blues and rock that the Beatles loved so much. It's still a good album, in the grand scheme of things. It's just that among the Beatles other records, it stands as a pretty weak example of the ouvre. Buy this album, but only after you buy the records mentioned above.of the ouvre.

B00008EYA5|2.0|Although I was warned by a friend that this movie wasn't that great, I went ahead and rented it anyway.<BR>The big attraction to this movie for me was the top actors.  I love Samuel L. Jackson, and Colin Farrell, and figured with these two involved the movie couldn't be that bad.<br />Well I was wrong (yawn) after enduring predictable dialogue and action scenes that seemed unexciting and very repetitive to say the least, I wish that I had saved the money and spent it elsewhere.  No real story line, boring scenes, and nothing that even slightly got my interest, I would say that this was a fine set of actors used in a very disappointing way.<br />Don't waste your time or money on this one.
B00005RHGK|4.0|I bought this movie when it first came out. I saw it in the theaters and loved it. it gave me nightmares for a few nights even! most movies don't do this!

I would advise renting before buying because alot of people don't like this movie.

B000002H70|1.0|The Cure is a close second to U2 in the race for being the worst band in rock history.  It's astounding how horrible their music really is.  Asking me to listen to the Cure or U2 is like asking me whether I would like to be shot in the gut or kneecaps.<br />\\"Disintegration\\" is nothing but a 71 minute and 42 second pity party.  Heavily laced with cheesy '80's synthesizers the music and vocals are so fragile it's is sure to induce nausea at least.  They add complex melodies just to show how pretensious they are.<br />It's not dark and gloomy album but rather a pathetic opus.  Dark and gloomy is murder suicide, and child molestation, not universal life experiences.  Middle class anxieties and broken relationships are not heavy emotions; it's normal life experience.  The album, along with the Cure's whole career, shows how anything can be dramatized.  It's surprised they don't whine about hangnails and bad parking spots.<br />The cherry on top of this sunday is Robert Smith's voice.  If his pathetic whining voice is not the most annoying thing recorded, I don't know what is.  How anybody could stand it for more than five minutes is a mystery.<br />There are not enough words to describe how awful the complete waste of time called \\"Disintegration\\" really is.  Horrible, disgusting, nasty, wretched, and atrocious doesn't even to begin to describe the listening experience.
B00000I41G|5.0|This is a perfect marriage of Jazz and Blues music. There is not a weak track on this CD...even with the reissiue bonus tracks. Kenny Burrell simply does not play a wasted note, he fills it up in all the right places. Add the saxophone of Stanley Turrentine and the other musicians to the mix and this CD flows from the first cut to the last, the whole greater than the fantastic sum of it's parts. Perfect for dinner/cocktail parties or headphone listening, music does not get much better than this.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney's fourth album is no doubt her most sexual and adventurous to date, and perhaps her best. While it might not be as 'pop' as her past records it does show her maturity as an artist. He voice is smooth, unique and fun to listen to. Hightlights include \\"Me Against the Music\\" f/ Madonna - an excellent upbeat track that you can listen to over and over again. \\"Showdown\\", co-written by Britney, is an awesome dance track who's catchy chorus will have you humming it all day. The ballad \\"Everytime\\" is sung so beautifully and pacted with tons of emotion. \\"The Hook Up\\" is one of the best dancehall theme's I've ever heard. Overall, there is not a bad song on the album. They all show different genres and musical styles, taking Britney from star to legend. Well done, Britney.

0385504209|3.0|Reads like Foucault's Pendulum Lite, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Half the obscurity, twice the readability, but somehow not as satisfying. If you're acquainted with &quot;conspiracy&quot; theory and/or history in any real sense this book will leave you feeling sort of embarassed that your once arcane knowledge will no longer shock people at parties. If, however, you're a total numbskull and have bought everything they've taught you over the years, then this makes a pretty good introduction to the world as it is, and you will probably reject it, because its truths unmask the lies you've accepted for so long.
0671027344|1.0|The book was, quite simply, awful--a coming of age story for functional illiterates.  Not only does it allude to a lot of much better books, the ending is stolen straight from The Catcher in the Rye.  But Charlie's no Holden Caufield, just weepy kid with nice parents, nice friends--hell, he's bereft of angst! Chbosky should forfeit his royalty checks and start sending them to Cornish, NH, care of Mr. Jerome David Salinger.

B00005JLZN|2.0|As a film student I have read many theories on film by many different theorists. One of the common ideas that come up in several of the major theories is the idea that a film manipulates an audience to feel, emote and think what the film maker intends. Hitchock was the master of such a technique. In &quot;The Life of David Gale&quot; this idea is used in a way that humiliates the audience. It's almost as if director Alan Parker is watching over your shoulder the entire film and is laughing at you in the end. This is a very gripping film. I found myself really wrapped up in the story, trying to figure out the puzzle and also eagerly awaiting the story to unfold and the answers to be revealed. However, this couldn't be more of a let down. After all the excitement, the ending leaves me (and apparently many viewers, including Roger Ebert) disgusted and angry. The entire story was all rubbish. The ending makes no sense, because it is not explained in anyway. I usually don't like it when a film ends with a little ribbon on top and there are no questions left unanswered but this one really needs one. It's probably worth seeing, but beware!
B000002H97|4.0|I love Metallica and FANHALEN....FANHALEN always knows what he is talking about..so I took his advice-THANX FANNY- about this album and I am forever indebted because it goes up with the other classic METT-albums...awesome album,awesome FAN.
B00008PW2D|4.0|People that are B*$%^#$ about the price need to stop.  No one forced them to go out and buy it...you bought, so deal with it.  I first got addicted to SATC when I received season three as a b-day gift, and let me tell you that it has been the best gift ever.  I have bought all the other seasons since then, including the fifth season.  Yes, it's not like the others, but it's still good.  You gotta think beyond the other seasons...they have differerent life styles now that they are older so you gotta expect something different.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|That's right, not just good, or even kinda good, but really good! I read some X-Men comics when I was younger and watched the cartoon so I was ready to unleash my nerdiness at the theater when this thing opened up. I was worried it may not be too good (I think the first one was only average), but I needn't have worried. This movie is awesome.<br />So what's it got: <BR>1. Fast-paced action (ooooo)<BR>2. Cool Special Effects (aaaaah)<BR>3. Ian &quot;Gandalf&quot; MacKellan as Magneto (weeeee)<BR>4. Patrick &quot;Picard&quot; Stewart as Prof. X (neeeee)<BR>5. Awesome story with numerous characters that don't get all jumbled and hard to follow.(zort)<br />But you never read a comic book you say? Don't matter! This ain't a hard to follow flick. You know who to root for and what's at stake. Just sit back bub, and fasten your recliner seat belt.<br />So yeah, I've watched this DVD a couple times already. Go fot it. A+
B00006RCOB|3.0|FIREFOX is one of those films made back when the U.S.S.R. still existed, and espionage is the key here. Clint Eastwood plays Mitchell Gant, a retired Air Force pilot who is resurrected to steal the FIREFOX fighter jet from Russia. Based on a novel by the same name, FIREFOX certainly looks like an interesting movie, and it is to some extent. It has a little James Bond flavor in it too. It is not great, however, and has many flaws.<br />Eastwood constantly changes deguise throughout the film as his allies seek to get him to the jet. The process is long and confusing, and the whole time Clint doesn't look like he has any idea what he is doing. Once he grabs the jet itself, and pulls out of the hanger, night suddenly changes to day! The special effects during the flying sequences are exciting. John Dykstra, who won an oscar for the special effects in STAR WARS, did the job on the effects here and the results are impressive, even though they look dated. The movie does drag, however, when the U.S.S.R. intellegence constantly is trying to figure out which direction he is headed. The worst thing about this film is the ending. After winning a dramatic dogfight with the other FIREFOX, the movie ends right there in the sky. It would have been interesting if Eastwood could have entended it a little more to at least see him land the plane in his home country. This was Eastwood's eighth time as a director as well. The movie is interesting, but the minor flaws, and flat ending are what kind of hold it back from being great. FIREFOX wass a good movie, but it could have been better, alot better.
B0000C8AW2|3.0|Having thought for many years that this was Dylan's worst major album--in the sense that unlike, say, &quot;Self-Portrait,&quot; he really seems to be trying here--I find myself surprised by this happy reassessment. The band is excellent: Organist Alan Pasqua makes like Al Kooper. Drummer Ian Wallace and bassist Jerry Scheff (who knows first-hand about playing Vegas--with the King himself) make a punchy, tight rhythm section. They are a drastic improvement over that of &quot;Desire&quot; and Rolling Thunder, whose wheels are constantly in danger of falling off.<br />The songs themselves are dark and evocative. Dylan takes unusual care with the melodies, which rescue weaker songs like &quot;No Time to Think&quot; or &quot;Is Your Love in Vain.&quot; I'm not excusing his lyrics' self-pity, and I wish he liked women more, but the words skillfully convey an intense feeling of unhappiness--apocalypse around every bend.<br />Unfortunately, the album begins a trend (which continues throughout the '80s) in which Dylan frequently sings at the upper end of his range, which makes for a thin, nasally vocal (the one most caricatured by people who don't like Dylan).<br />But the new CD _sounds_ great. I don't have the original LP to compare it to (or the reissue of the mid-'90s), but the sound is bright, clear, and full. My CD of the late-'80s sounds muddy by comparison.
B00009XITP|5.0|Oh my gosh! i absolutely loved this movie! This is my all time favorite movie to just sit down and watch with my Mother! I mean You have this all-american girl who travels to a distant country, falls madly in love. And finds a part of her that was missing! AWWW! I bought this movie and I've already watched it like 7 times! I love it!
0452282152|4.0|I am a 20 something year old man and i loved this book.  The movie is great too and it is intersteing to note the differences between them.  Both my parents loved this book and I think it is not only a good story but intersting to get into the mind of a famous painter.
B000099T2L|1.0|I have not heard all of the songs on Beyonce's cd, but I think I have seen her in the media enough to say what I am about to say. <br />Beyonce has a great voice.  I never doubted that she would be able to do a solo album.  My thing is this: for all the CLASSIC female singers that she (among others) claim to emulate, did any of those women EVER, and I mean EVER, have to come out the house looking like they were ready to walk 14th Street in Washington, DC???!!!  I feel like this, I'm not certain whether or not her cd was aimed more at men or more at women, but I do know one thing, it does absolutely nothing for me (a female) to see her as naked as she usually is.  Is that what you have to do to be accepted? Forget the voice, just parade around in next to nothing.  Hey, I guess that's what is keeping Ashanti from taking her 'Rain' back to Glen Cove.<br />I just had to vent.  I know nothing about this cd aside from the songs that have been released.  I'm waiting for my friend to burn me a copy.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|will totally relate to this album.  The pain is very real.
B00005JM0B|3.0|John Connor (Nick Stahl) has been in hiding for years after the death of his mother who had taught him that he will be a great leader one day for the resistance against the machines.  However, as John remains in hiding he gets into an accident that leads to an encounter between John and Kate Brewster (Claire Danes).  The two of them are attacked by a new and improved version of the original T-800 robot called T-X  that is on a mission to exterminate all future leaders of the resistance.  However, another Terminator robot (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has been sent to protect both John and Kate against this new T-X.  This is the beginning for an action packed roller coaster that will bring the audience through highs and lows at a fast pace that will not slow down until the end.  This does not leave much time for contemplative work, but it does keeps the audience engaged from the beginning to the end.  Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines leaves the audience with a satisfactory cinematic experience where the audience is left with a supreme cliffhanger: a cliffhanger made to make another box-office hit that can bring in more revenue.
1582432678|4.0|I just finished We Need to Talk About Kevin by Lionel Shriver, a brilliant novelist.  At first I was put off by the overly ambitious vocabulary, but as soon as the story took hold of me I couldn't put it down.  All the characters were fascinating and utterly believable.  I kept wondering how the author was able to so perfectly create Kevin's sociopathic personality without actually having lived with such a child.  I found Franklin (the father) very frustrating in his naivite. But let's face it men often do lack the gene that enables them to read into people and see the worst. The dynamic between Eva (the mother), Franklin and Kevin rang so true.<BR>I was expecting to be more torn in my analysis of Eva's culpability.  But from very early on in the book, my feeling was that in spite of Eva's reluctance to have children and her utter disdain for pregnancy, she was guilt free.  She never bonded with Kevin largely because of Kevin's initial rejection of her.  He continued to reject her along with the rest of the world and made it impossible for her to love him.  The one time in the book when he offered her the slightest glimmer of an open heart (when he was sick with a high fever) she was ready to run with it.  He wouldn't let her though and thoroughly enjoyed snatching away the hope he had offered her.  A bad seed.  Clearly, a bad seed.<BR>I was not at all shocked by the &quot;twist&quot;, but rather had suspected it early on.  The fact that it was held back in order to be shocking felt manipulative to me and I think Ms. Shriver is a better writer than that.  I also feel the ending is unbelievable, given Kevin's pathology.  For these reasons I've only given 4 stars.  I did however, love this book.  The best I've read in a long time.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|I will be the first to admit that I bought her first cd solely b/c of the hype surrounding it.  I hated it!  So when they started playing \\"You Don't Know My Name,\\" it took a while for it to grow on me.  The day this album came out, my friend went to pick some up for some people. I told him to pick me up one.  I almost told him not to worry about it.  And I'm so glad I did. This album is good and worth a listen.  A. Keys gets you from start about the middle of the album. Yeah, the second half, after Diary, is pretty much a downer.    My favorite tracks are Karma, Heartburn, If I Were Your Woman/Walk on By (nice cover of Gladys), You Don't Know My Name, If I Ain't Got You/With this cd, she definitely made a believer out of me.
B0001A79JO|5.0|i have listen to a few tracks on this cd and i can tell that i have become a horrorpops fan for life ! the bass is so rockin in this album i love it rock on horrorpops ur doing great ! nothing but love ~~Maria~~
B0000W3YIS|3.0|I rushed out to buy this cd on the very first day it was available, just like with her previous 2, &quot;Britney&quot; and &quot;Oops... I did it Again&quot;, but this cd, while ambitious and showing growth, is a let down.  The 3 best songs on this cd are &quot;Everytime&quot;, a beautiful ballad, the Jamaican rhythmic &quot;Hookup&quot; and the bouncy, fun &quot;Toxic&quot;, but most of the rest are just plain lame.  I see her emulating Madonna on songs like &quot;Early Morning&quot; and &quot;Breathe On Me&quot;, but after you hear them once they seem lacking and bland.  On the bright side, at least she didn't put anything by Max Martin on this cd.  My advice to Britney, keep moving in the direction that you're going but focus on quality.
B000002MG1|5.0|FIrst off, you should certainly check out the other R.E.M albums as they are all very, very good. Although, Automatic for the People has its own special way to touch the heart. All the songs on this album are all incredibly beautiful. Lyrically, R.E.M pulls off by delivering sad yet hopefull lyrics of depression and despair. Simply from talking of the freedom of &quot;Night Swimming&quot; or the despair of death in &quot;Try not to Breathe&quot;. The whole album shows classic R.E.M at its best. Please do yourself a favor and pick this one up, you wont be disapointed.
B00005ASIL|4.0|this is a good compilation, and for the average person it is worth the money, but for those of you, like myself, treat &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; as a devout christian would treat a bible this CD will be a little dissapointing. The song fades out and not all of it is heard. But if your religion isn't Jethro Tulls Church of Wisdom and you just enjoy listening to Jethro Tull, this is a CD worth at least a second look. ...And then she ate the pie!
B000002KDO|4.0|I always knew what &quot;Sweet Leaf&quot; was about, but until a few years ago I didn't know that the cough at the beginning was Tony Iommi choking after a pull on the evil weed!<br />This is really the last of the heavy, roots-industrial-Birmingham, England metal that the band would do with Ozzy.  After this they got gradually more (in some cases TOO) experimental until the Dio-fronted comeback with &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;.<br />Tony's riffs, are, of course, the defining centre of this black and purple globe of heavy metal.  There is no letup on his crunching, except for the out-of-character &quot;Solitude&quot; (which also features Tony playing flute).  He even gets a go at Christian rock with his lyrics to &quot;After Forever&quot; (yaa boo sucks to all the Televangelists who have tirelessly painted this band as the gateway to hell)!<br />Geezer is almost as dominant as Tony on this album - which would manifest itself again much later on the excellent &quot;Born Again&quot; album with Ian Gillan.  Really, you need good speakers or Geez's bass will rattle them!<br />Bill Ward is rumoured to have had trouble nailing some of the drum parts on this album, notably on &quot;Into The Void&quot;, due to his increasing drink and drugs problem.  I'm glad he did as technique-wise this is some of his best drumming though I'm not a fan of the dead-snare drum sound he gets here.<br />And Ozzy?  Well, my feelings are known about him, both as a non-singer (though excellent entertainer) and now fan rip-off merchant (see his &quot;remastered&quot; early solo albums - don't buy them, just see them!) but again he is an integral part of this band.  &quot;Solitude&quot; has to be his strangest vocal ever, except for maybe &quot;Planet Caravan&quot;.  It's also one of his best.<br />Essential.
B00009TB5G|5.0|My first thought after finishing 'The Fellowship of the Ring' was HOW are they going to translate 'The Two Towers' into a credible movie??  My mind raced at a thousand miles-an-hour knowing that if they screwed up just one major element that it could spell doom for the two remaining movies.  I thought first to Treebeard and how they were going to bring the Ents to life on screen and make it look *right*...I then wondered about Gollum and how a full digital character could be brought to life convincingly enough for the public to actually believe he is a real living breathing creature...how could the battle at Helm's Deep be done at ALL??  I am happy to say that Peter Jackson has very much earned the tremendous respect of Tolkien fans the world over by bringing together one of the most talented filming crews to ever work on ANY movie, and literally breathing life into a tremendous story.  As good as 'The Two Towers' was on the big screen, the extended version on dvd is in fact even better.  So MUCH was left out that could have (some say SHOULD have) been included, and overall gives us fans an even better understanding of how incredibly daunting the task of bringing all of this to the big screen really was.  The extra footage was definitely worth the wait.  An additional 43 MINUTES of scenes, some just extending existing shots, and some entirely new scenes make this edition well worth watching.<br />I personally enjoyed the extra footage of Faromir with Boromir and their Father at Osgiliath, which helps explain further his actions in 'Return of the King' and Merry &amp; Pippen in the Fangorn Forest drinking and growing taller...a scene I felt was sorely missed from the theatrical edition.  What really added to the enjoyment of this special dvd was the extra 2 discs which go into great detail on the making of these tremendous films and gives even the dullest layperson a small glimpse into just how incredibly difficult the job of filming the entire 3 movies must have been.  Even though they talk (at length sometimes) of how hard this project was, they talk just as much about how rewarding it was, because in the back of their minds they ALL knew that they were making history.  One of the most facinating portions of the extra discs was the creation and making of Gollum.  From Andy Serkis who literally BECAME Gollum to how Peter Jackson did an about face after 'The Fellowship' had already been released and MUCH of the principle filming of Gollum had been finished and told his digital production crew that they needed to re-do Gollum to more closely match the facial features of the voice done by Andy.  They go into detail about how impossible this task was, but how as they went about fulfilling Peter's mandate, they created a much better character and a much better movie in the process.  I'm absolutely shocked that Andy was passed over at the Golden Globe &amp; Oscars for a nomination because of how utterly convincing this character was.  The extended dvd far surpassed my expectations and helped to whet my appetite for the crowning achievement that is 'The Return of the King' the absolute best movie of the trilogy and one of the best pieces of filmmaking I have ever seen and should not just be nominated for Best Movie, it really ought to win.  I can think of NO other films I have ever seen that has evoked such tremendous emotions in me, and Peter Jackson and everyone associated with making these movies should be revered for all-time for doing true justice to the books which have been beloved by readers the world over for over 50 years.  Absolutely fantastic and HIGHLY recommended.een.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|This is one of the best CDs I have ever listened to.  It could almsot be used as a compilation of 27 (yep, 27 on one CD, wow!) of the most musically perfect and appealing songs ever written.<BR>From the early, care-free days of \\"Love Me Do\\", \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\", and \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\", through to the more deep and insightful songs such as \\"Let It Be\\" and \\"The Long and Winding Road\\", as well as the undeniable classics like \\"Yesterday\\" and \\"Yellow Submarine\\", this CD has it all.<BR>Possibly the only downside of this CD is that some of the Beatles greatest songs never actually made it to number one, such as \\"In My Life\\", \\"Back in the USSR\\", \\"Twist and Shout\\", \\"Ob-la-di ob-la-da\\", and of course the eternal \\"Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\\"  Their exclusion from the CD will be disappointing for big Beatles fans like myself.<BR>However, this does not detract from what is truly an amazing CD.  It is already the highest selling compact disc of all time, so it must be doing something right.
B0000DCGT1|4.0|What an absolute gem of a picture. Everything -- the writing, directing, acting, cinematography, everything -- was nearly perfect.<br />To take a fairly old and mundane subject (come on now, it was a racing horse, after all, not a world-shaking topic or event) and turn it into a movie that reflects the history and spirit of this country, and the class rivalry at the time, was an accomplishment in itself.<br />By making the film almost a documentary in parts was inspired. And it's amazing how the film develops character with just a few quick scenes, yet the characters never lapse into cliche or stereotypes. I liked them all (and that's important to me ... why spend 2 hours with people you don't like?)<br />It may not be the perfect movie (which is?) ... but it is truly one of the best to come out in recent years.
B000002B7M|4.0|Get this one if you can find it.  Do NOT, repeat, do NOT, get the &quot;remastered version with additional tracks!  It is one of the biggest ripoffs since George Harrison did his bit with &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; - Ozzy (Sharon?) wiped Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake from that &quot;remaster&quot;.  And the worst part is you don't know it until you buy it and get it home and notice how different it sounds.  I found this used and it still sounds like 1981...and that's no bad thing as far as I'm concerned, digital age or not!<br />My usual one-star knockoff for Ozzy not being much of a singer.  He's an entertainer, this is most certainly true, but no singer.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|This definitely is the best RHCP video/DVD release and definitely one of the best concert DVD's ever.  The sound and the video - this includes the camera angles, lighting and effects - are of the highest quality.  Hell, the venue background is a castle.<br />This captures what one show of the \\"By The Way\\" tour looked like for those that missed it, but should be essential for those who caught them on that tour.  Having seen the Peppers six times over their career, the shows on the \\"By The Way\\" tour are in the upper echelon (Woodstock and my first show after the return of John Frusciante takes no. 1), mainly focusing on songs from \\"By The Way\\" and \\"Californication.\\"  <br />Some may have qualms with the setlist, but you can't blame them for taking out BSSM songs (excluding the hits they \\"have\\" to play) - that album is over ten years old and they have grown considerably as musicians, particularly the definite star of this show, John Frusciante.  He is enigmatic on stage and brilliant in his guitar playing.  His vocal harmonies are pitch perfect and really beautiful.  The DVD also includes the doo-wop song he performed on the tour (it's buried at the tail end of \\"Around The World\\") and in my opinion the highlight of the disc.<br />This is a must for RHCP/John Frusciante fans.  No question.
B00000JGOJ|4.0|Honestly, I only rented this movie because Angelina Jolie is a goddess and if she were in a telephone booth, I would take it home and watch it.  But this movie was actually pretty decent!  I'll qualify that in a moment, but for the time being, I'll say this: if you're an Angelina fan, you should see her make her mark in an unlikely charmer of a romantic comedy and satisfy your conscience by realizing that you love her not only because she's hotter than hell, but also because she really is an amazingly unique talent.<br />Okay, the movie.  Decent, as I said.  It's got its problems, as do most things like this.  First of all is pace: because the movie is a series of intertwined vignettes, some story lines are naturally more compelling than others.  What results is a start-stop-start jolt to the movie that can mostly be forgiven on account of an all-star cast.  Second of all is the all-star cast: the cast is ultimately bigger than the film is, which isn't an explicit problem except to a director who believes that every film is the sum of all the stars who make up its parts.  In the end, there is a feeling that a lot of the talent was wasted on roles that were too small and too trite.  The upside is that in this relatively small film, all of the parts are well acted, which saves a tenuously interwoven film from falling flat on its face.  The third, and perhaps most unforgivable, problem is the script: because it is painfully chunky in parts, I imagine it only could have taken one or two read-throughs to realize that when words get stuck in people's mouths, it's because people don't normally talk that way.  Well-written dialogue doesn't necessarily translate into being a well-written screenplay, and it kills some parts of the movie that could actually have been fantastic.  The comedy of the script is usually artfully subtle (one of the movie's strengths), but the parts where it gets a bit chunky and heavy-handed with the symbolism are contrived and overwrought with Willard Carroll's pervasive self-loving.<br />That said, it's a movie that makes you feel pretty good after having watched it, but it is frustrating that the best cast parts -- Angelina Jolie, Jon Stewart, Gillian Anderson -- are confined to such small segments of the film.  Each vignette has a lot to offer if you care to think about the movie deeply enough, and you have to admire this very humble and well-intentioned film.
B0000E1WKE|4.0|Its very easy for listeners to take cheap shots at Whitney because of the previous difficult years heightened by bad press, obviously having a reflect on the negative reviews and opinions. If there is one thing for sure, One Wish is an exceptionally fabulous CD and unique in a not so typical holiday fashion. With a gospel twist in most of the songs stemming back to her strongest vocal roots. The proof speaks for itself One Wish has sold over an estimated half million copies for a Christmas Album. This is obviously one of the most popular Christmas CD's this 2003 if not the best.
B000089RV6|5.0|The Album starts off with a bell ringing, as a tribute to Bon Scott, the original singer who died before the recording of this album. The cover and start may be somber, but this is a loud, fun, heavy metal masterpiece. Not a weak track anywhere.<br />Hells Bells 10/10<BR>Best song on the album, in my opinion. The Bells leading to the powerful opening riff, is a suberb start to the album. A concert staple.<br />Shoot to thrill 9/10<BR>A good song, with a great chorus. The riff and versdes are good, not AC/DC's best, but the fast paced thrashy chorus makes this song a classic.<br />What do you do for Money Honey? 9/10<BR> A more pop orientated song, but not in a bad way, with a melodic riff and shout along chorus, this is different sounding to AC/DC's other more rough songs.<br />Givin the Dog a Bone 8/10<BR> A less strong song, still way above your average heavy metal song, proving that AC/DC can do no wrong. On this album at least.<br />Let me Put my Love into You 9/10<BR> Starts off like hells bells, with a bass drum instead of a bell ringing. This is another excellent powerful rock song. The bridge on this song is my favorite part.<br />Back in Black 10/10<BR> The title track. What can I say? While not as big a hit as You Shook me.., this song is up there with Master of Puppets and Paranoid for the best metal song of all time. Ever bit of this song rocks!<br />You Shook me all Night Long 9/10<BR> The closest AC/DC have ever done to a love song. Softer than the rest of the album, this song is still heavy enough to stop it getting into the top 10. Which is a good thing in my opinion.<br />Have a Drink on Me 7/10<BR> Another tribute to Bon Scott. This song sounds similar to Givin the Dog a Bone. Still a fine song, but probebly the weakest on the album.<br />Shake a Leg 8/10<BR>Different to the rest of the album. A very good song. The riff and tempo are faster than the rest of the album. Wether this is a good thing is up to you. I think this is a great song.<br />Rockand Roll Ain't Noise Pollution 8/10<BR> A slower song to finish off the album. This Song, Both finishes the album, and shows the critics that AC/DC weren't going to  be going away for a long time. And they still arent.
0739307312|5.0|This book was both entertaining and informative and I strongly recommend it to anyone who is literate!!
B0000TB014|4.0|Yes, the classics are back - from Billie Jean to You Rock My World but unfortunately so is the filler - from Earth Song to Blood On The Dancefloor. Songs such as 'Scream' or 'Who Is It' should of made the cut.<br />This collection would have been given a sure-fire 5 stars but unfortunately the quality of this DVD does not reach the standard. There are no special features and the video version of 'Smooth Criminal' is a disgrace. Its a reminder that Michael Jackson's videos were definately ground breaking at the time and spectacular in every sense of the word. A must have purcase, buy it with 'Dangerous - The Short Films'.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I must say, I was quite worried about the quality of Britney Spears' next album when I first heard \\"Me Against the Music.\\"  Let me just say that the first single off this record does not even come close to how amazing some of these tracks are!  This album embodies so many different styles of music - from hip-hop to trip-hop to rock and even techno.  <br />The slick, club-worthy 'Breathe on Me' is definitely a highlight of this album, with it's sensual, pulsing beat and seductive lyrics.  \\"One love united, two bodies synchronizing, don't even need to touch me baby, just breathe on me.\\"  Is it hot in here or is it just me?  ;-)  <br />'Toxic,' a song that compares dangerous men to a drug addiction, is one of the most innovative songs.  It's a turbulant mish-mash of distorted strings and grinding static.  Very trippy and VERY catchy.  <br />Quite the opposite is the tender ballad 'Everytime.'  Its delicate and effective blend of piano, harp, and strings compliment her fragile-as-glass singing of a lost love.  People tend to think of this song only as \\"the song Britney wrote about Justin,\\" but I love to lay in bed and actually listen to the music - the beautiful orchestration and the heartbreaking lyrics.    <br />And of course, we can't forget the infamous and sexy 'Touch of My Hand,' in which Britney sings of exploring her body \\"in a most precious way.\\"  The verses are decorated with dreamy Asian strings before evolving into the funky and catchy chorus.      <br />Several people I know who have listened to 'In the Zone' have a newfound respect for Britney Spears.  There is something appealing for almost every type of music fan.  The whole album is definitely worth listening to!
0385504209|2.0|The Da Vinci code is undoubtedly a page turner and contains some interesting (though not new) material on Mary Magdalen and the sacred feminine. However, it is extraordinarily badly written with some very cliched characterisation - upper-class villainous Brit - how very Hollywood! A green eyed red haired heroine - how often has she been done? Some good editing, preferably from a non-American would have been helpful. I'm sure no Frenchman would regard the Eiffel tower as the symbol of France - Marianne fulfills that role. And since when has anyone English said 'I'm truly sorry for your loss'. Lastly, scholarly English librarians simply would not indulge in tactless banter with an esteemed American researcher over the wisdom of knighting Rudi Giuliani. Was Dan Brown trying to make a post 9/11 point? Buy this book for its silly frenetic plot and intriguing artistic insights but don't expect great literature.
B0000C9V3T|4.0|I recommend this CD for anyone captivated by the movie; it's great from beginning to end with one notable exception.  The CD contains the entire tracks of several pieces of music that are only heard in excerpt in the actual movie, including a 10-minute version of &quot;Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood&quot; (which kinda gets old after a while, but overall it's a cool tune).  &quot;Battle without Honor or Humanity&quot; is the instrumental played when Oren Ishii and her personal bodyguards (including Gogo, the bodyguard dressed as a Japanese schoolgirl) are walking in slow-motion as they enter the House of Blue Leaves (one of my favorite scenes in the movie, for some reason).  &quot;Flower of Carnage&quot; is, despite its title, a beautiful ballad in Japanese.  (I wonder how the lyrics translate?)  The only track on the CD that I dislike (and I strongly dislike it) is &quot;Ode to Oren Ishii&quot; by RZA, which is a rap song about Oren that sounds like it was written by a five-year-old, so lame are the lyrics.  &quot;I wanna dedicate this song right here to O-Ren Ishii, Half Chinese/Half Japane-see, Half American.&quot;  Half Chinese, half Japanese, half American . . . is that mathematically possible?  And ryhming &quot;Ishii&quot; with &quot;Japane-see&quot; -- is &quot;Japane-see&quot; a real word?  Sorry, but the song annoys me!  My only other quibble is with the sound effects at the end of the CD (axe throws and sword swings): they don't sound like axe throws and sword swings; rather, they merely sound like electronic noise, which clearly works fine in the movie, but at only a very few seconds each these little sound bytes don't add anything to the CD.  I'm complaining too much, though -- 95 percent of the CD is terrific, so I say buy it!
B000002KJM|1.0|Find yourselves the original album or casette and play it for a pure sound. This cd release is remastered with added effects that deletes any history of what ZZ Top's original sound was.
B0000CFW87|5.0|To describe this CD, only one word comes to mind: amazing.  Being familiar with Josh's first album, the growth in his already extraordinary voice is more than evident to me on &quot;Closer.&quot;  He challenges himself with higher notes and more powerful melodies, along with more sensitive and seductive ballads - and does it all with supreme skill and grace.  To speak the truth, I am not a huge opera fan, but Josh's voice is so clear and beautiful that you cannot help but marvel at it.  Josh adds a modern edge to classical-sounding pieces, with contemporary beats and innovative orchestral arrangements.  While this album obviously leans more into a more edgy, modern-pop feel with songs like &quot;Never Let Go&quot; and &quot;My Confession,&quot; &quot;Closer&quot; certainly does not lack Josh's trademark tender ballads.  His velvet voice soothes the soul on romantic tracks like &quot;Hymne A L'Amour&quot; and the magnificent &quot;Mi Mancherai,&quot; featuring talented violinist Joshua Bell.  And while about half the CD is in a foreign language (either in Italian, French, or Spanish), the English songs are truly breathtaking, with touching lyrics and flowing melodies.  On &quot;Closer,&quot; Josh adds to his already promising potential by showcasing his songwriting talent, composing the music for &quot;Per Te&quot; and the lyrics on the moving &quot;Remember When It Rained&quot; (where he also plays the piano) and &quot;Never Let Go.&quot;   Overall, Josh straddles the pop-classical-opera line with captivating ease and beauty.  This is truly a wonderful album, and it leaves the listener with an insight into the amazing potential of this extremely talented young artist.
0140157352|5.0|It's amazing to me that this book was written over twenty years ago, but is still so relevant.  Negotiation is a passion of mine, and I have read this book multiple times because the ideas presented in it are the basis for almost any book that has been written on negotiation since its publication.  Plus, it is a quick read that almost anyone can understand.  <br />This book revolutionized negotiation with its claim that you would be better off if the person that you were negotiating with also read this book.  Rather than focusing on tricks and ways to manipulate the other side, it shows you how to set up a cooperative, win-win negotiation.  <br />Such terms as win-win negotiation, cooperative problem solving, BATNA (best alternative to a negotiated agreement), and negotiation jujitsu might sound trite because they are used so frequently in other negotiation texts.  However, I'm willing to look past that since these terms originated here.<br />In multiple negotiations--big and small--I have used the process outlined in this book (1. &quot;separate the people from the problem&quot;, 2. &quot;focus on interests, not positions&quot;, 3. &quot;invent options for mutual gain&quot;, 4. &quot;insist on using objective criteria&quot;) to produce successful results.<br />Your ability to negotiate affects so many parts of your life (from how much money you make to how you resolve conflicts with your spouse) that it is worth investing in this book and in becoming a better negotiator.<br />While (because the book is a tad idealistic) I do not recommend making this the only book that you read on negotiation, I highly recommend it as one of the books to read.  I'd also recommend checking out &quot;Getting Past No&quot; by Bill Ury, which is the follow-on to this and discusses how to handle situations in which the other side doesn't want to cooperate.
B0000AM6JI|1.0|Practically everything about this movie is AWFUL!!!<BR>This piece of crap is one of the worst flicks I've ever seen. It's probably the first of Pacino's worst films (his streak is still going strong)! I love Pacino's early work, but ever since this one, he REALLY started to suck. He should never try to impersonate a latino EVER again... His effort was simply offensive, esp. with all of the great hispanic actors out there practically begging for work. Another example of Hollywood at it's worst (and most obvious)...  Stop the Madness!!!<br />And for those of you out there who think I'm so different from you, ya oughta' know that I even have a friend who's IN this movie, not to mention I love these TYPE of movies (i.e. The Godfather, Scarface, The Sopranos, Good Fellas, Traffic, etc.) AND most of all, I'm a HUGE Brian DePalma fan!
B000084T18|2.0|Wanksta was a good song. In Da Club was ok. The rest of the album is just BAD. Don't take me the wrong way by the title to this(ie. Loose Change), I hate Ja Rule's rap too, but Get Rich Or Die Tryin isn't worth the money. Most of the beats are really good - wether it was Eminem or Dre or whoever else that produced it, I'd buy this CD if it had the Instrumentals. <br />But the truth is, Fitty definately does NOT deserve the hype he's getting. Obie Trice is so much better than him, and D12 totally outdoes Fitty's gUnit. Though I found his tracks Back Down and Order of Protection kinda funny and how they made fun of Ja, but the CD isnt worth the money.
B000008M54|5.0|This cd is one if you hear once, you will want to get the cd at some point in time.  It is a celtic rock, ballad type sound and the lead singers voice is one to never forget.  The first track is the best so listen to it back wards.  Hopefully they come as a group to Milwaukee soon instead of acoustic which i probably would not have known as much of.  BUY it now, i found a used on on ebay for 6 dollars.
B00005AQE8|5.0|Hell yeah,<br />this is one of hip-hop/rap greatest of all time record.  I have these joints in my car cd player more than 6 months and it still make me say THUG LIFE BABY!!!!!!!
B00005JMCT|4.0|If you liked 1 and 2, then you won't be disappointed with this movie!
B000007T1M|1.0|It really makes me sick when people refer to system as metal(heavy,death,black, etc.) This band is in no way metal. All this bands songs are just random words with crappy guitar riffs and talentless drumming. Serj cannot sing in key or scream for his life(for really good harsh vocals see: opeth, dimmu borgir, emperor, dark tranquillity, etc.). <br />I'd also like to say that bashing power chords randomly as fast as you can does not imply that the music you're making is heavy(slipknot is the biiggest committer of this crime). bands like this and slipknot and linkin park are to music what AIDS is to humans. the nu-metal genre is an insult to metal and an atrocity that should never have been committed.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|If you like The Matrix and Blade, then you'll love this movie.  It has the fight scenes and black vinyl from Matrix and a modern spin on vampires.  It's fun, don't listen to those other reviews!
B000002BFL|5.0|The Ghost of Tom Joad is one of the most haunting albums I have ever listened to.  It was in fact listening to this album that I noticed the tremendous influence he has had on so many of our great singer/songwriters.  The music on Ghost is tremendously affecting.  It is Springsteen without his pop-enthusiasm.  The songs are bare, and his tremendous talents as a songwriter really stand out for all to see.  Ghost is a great album that showcases the considerable talents of one of our great songwriters.
0739307312|5.0|Any person who reads this book will have their eyes opened wider than ever before. You do not have to be a lapsed catholic to enjoy the mysteries surrounding the Roman Catholic Church. Dan Brown is a master at using words to create a scene like no other author.
B000021YQV|5.0|System of a Down is an all around awesome band!  They have talent that few metal bands of today can even come close to matching.  From intense screaming moments to well-sung melodies, Serj's voice kicks ass!  Guitar and drum work is awesome throughout!  Although some songs, such as Jet Piolet and Shimmy are a bit too weird for their own good, they make up for this minor flaw in every other way.  Hits like Chop Suey!, Toxicity, and Aerials are perfect for those who like the hardcore aspcet of SOAD.  Other awesome songs include Needles, X, Psycho, and Forest (though I really liked every song on here).  Though they sometimes tend to write songs that support the democratic point of view, SOAD is a band that will hopefully be around for a long time, and will hopefully make a huge dent in the rap and pop bull-s**t that has become way more popular.  Overall, I give this 4.5/5 stars.  Buy this album!!!
B00003CX9Q|5.0|This 2 DVD E.T. set is a real treat!!! You get 2 versions of the film:Original Theatricl and the 2002 Version,and cool extras!!! A top notch package!!! A classic family film!!!Great for E.T. fans!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+
B00005JMJ5|5.0|This is an excellent movie that speaks to a problem that we often have as human beings--- an inability to accept who we are and where we came from and the consequences of those decisions and choices that we make as a result.
B00004TDTO|5.0|This is a great DVD with bite!!! Lots of great extras,and a great widescreen presentation of the classic film!!! The first and best of the Jaws series!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five star movie,five star DVD!!! A+
B000002KIE|2.0|The first time I heard the Sex Pistols, I though \\"It sounds like Mott the Hoople with no keyboards.\\"  PiL has done alot better music over the years.  Johnny remarked it will go great with the Barry Manilow when it was released on CD.
B000000XBC|5.0|This second Chronicle CD is a great companion to the first volume. 20 more great CCR classics!!! A+
B000002C1W|3.0|This would be a better album if performed by Camel, though it would not have sold nearly as well.  As far as PF is concerned, well, it's better than &quot;The Piper...  Buy Camel &quot;Mirage&quot; instead.
B000000XB9|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet,this great CD has 20 great Creedence classics all on one little shiny disc!!! A rockin' CD!!! Five stars!!! A+
B000002534|1.0|I really hated this one.  It ended up in the used section like within a few weeks.  The singer's awful.  The promise of a Fisherman almost takes off, but it just doesn't go anywhere.
6305971145|5.0|This DVD of Santa Claus:The Movie from Anchor Bay is top notch!!! You get the Widscreen Presentation of the film,a great audio commentary,a nice featurette(a 50 minute featurette!!!),trailers,and talent bios!!! A great Christmas movie for the whole family!!! Two thumbs up!!!
055357342X|5.0|Although I found the third book of the series very LONG (1100+ pages in paperback), most of the chapters just flew by.  <br />Probably everyone has already described their favourite parts, so I'll make that quick:  all chapters with tyrion, the battle at the wall and blackwater, the red wedding, and the fight between the red vyper and the mountain.<br />Martin has this ability to start with a character we can really despise, make him human, and make us sympathize.  I think the chapters with Jaime Lannister really prove this.  I thought he was a very bad person in the first book.  Well, Jaime gets brought down a few notches, for sure.  At the end of the book they had a preview chapter for the next book about Cersei.  I can't wait :).  <br />I can only hope Martin is sensible and keeps the series short.  The way he's going, he might run out of characters before he runs of ideas :).  Good luck Martin!
B00003CX8T|5.0|this is a wonderful movie impossible to forget. It is as fresh in my mind as when I first saw it 10 years ago.<br />I will definetly buy it as soon as it is released in DVD.
B000002H6C|5.0|Before I listened to this album, my favorite was Master of Puppets, and my second favorite was ReLoad.  This album is now my second favorite.  When I listened to this album I was totally shocked.  This album has to be one of the heaviest and most complex albums in existence (What other album has 8 and 9 minute songs).  What really stands out about this album is that you don't get bored listening to it, in fact I want to listen to it right now.  Although Newsted's bass is hard to hear I found a solution....GET A SUBWOOFER!  This album sounds great when played with a subwoofer, it really amplifies Lars's drums and double bass kicks.<br />My favorite song on this album and all time Metallica favorite is One.  There isn't many songs where you can hold up a lighter at one part then get into a mosh pit in another.  This song really defined how Metallica felt at that point in their career.  My 2nd favorite song is ...And Justice for All.  This is probably their most underrated song, I just can't get enough of the crushing riffs.<br />All in all this is their best album next to Master of Puppets.  Probably because Master of Puppets is a revolutionary album and And Justice for All is just a continuation of that.  This album really showed everybody how they felt during those few years after Cliff's death...depressed and mad at the world.  This album is a must have for any Metallica fan, it is their hardest album ever, and its still fast like their first 3 albums.
B000006NPY|5.0|Adore es un disco que muestra el sonido mas &quot;limpio&quot; de este cuarteto. Los fans que busquen el sonido de otros discos este CD definitivamente no es el adecuado.<br />Creo que lo mas interesante es al final del disco. Blank Page es simple e &iacute;ntimo, &quot;For Martha&quot; es uno de los temas mas exquisitos del disco<br />Adore es muy recomendable.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Many people are tempted to indulge in art school pretension and just talk about how the Strokes are too mainstream, too digestable, blah blah blah. While the hype was ridiculous and unneccessary, it has NOTHING, i repeat NOTHING to do with the band, and furthermore, doesnt change the fact that they play great music. Its that simple. Call it what you will, the Strokes have created another great record, that actually may supercede the first musically...you just have to give it a chance. Woe to you who throws this CD out after one listen...big mistake kids. With each listen it grows on you more and more, the melodies click with you, the rythms start to attach themselves to you...its that simple. And THAT is what makes it great...sheer emotion in under 33 minutes. Nonstop musical bliss, thats what it is. Its not a huge progression from the first album, but its not supposed to be, guys. Its a stepping stone. But what youll hear you wont soon forget, and its a signal of GREAT things soon to come. Even the art school kids cant keep this one out of their CD players.
B000003TAL|4.0|Though SONIC YOUTH's songs are moderatley cohesive, the nuances and 180 degree turns they took and still take with their sound is something you'll either love or hate. And if you hate it, you need to expand your mind.<br />Much like Jazz is known for, and by that I mean letting a song explore within itself rather than placing it on the rails of a verse-chorus-verse mindless journey, SONIC YOUTH could be considered a band that was ahead of it's time.<br />DAYDREAM NATION was the first album I bought from them so that's why I'm placing a review here. Arguably there are better discs like SISTER and NYC GHOST AND FLOWERS, or more popular ones like DIRTY. That said, DAYDREAM NATION is them in a very unguarded moment. <br />Much like FUGAZI and BLACK FLAG, SONIC YOUTH were never really a singles band. The music industry caught up with them rather than the other way around.<br />Sonic Youth isn't for everybody, but if you like what you hear on DAYDREAM NATION, there's not a disc out there that will dissapoint you. It's not only the musical structure they produce that's intriguing, the lyrics are also unafraid to explore. Sometimes vague, or sometimes uncomfortably up front, this is a band that laid the groundwork for the alternative genre.<br />RESPECT THEIR AUTHORITY!
0440180295|5.0|If you haven't read this you should. It is amazing and Vonnegut is an incredible writer. If you have read it, reread it. I have read it three times. Also if you are a student, it is a great book to chose to read for an assignment or summer reading.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|Trully fantastic idea to re-release Let it Be to a new generation of would be fans. I saw it coming from the fake story in Rolling Stone magazine of the lost Let it be audio tapes to the barrage of articles created for the sole purpose of starting a buying frenzi....well it didn't work this time. I know it worked with &quot;1&quot; but you can't fool the people all the time! Yes, &quot;NAKED,&quot; is an attempt to re-introduce but it fails not in it's remastering or re-editing of the Spector songs but in the marketing. The &quot;get back&quot; sessions which these recordings come from were not meant to be released this way....Buy the &quot;30 days&quot; box set which includes an everyday audio account of the entire Let it Be recording session. It contains more than 13 CD's that reveal what most of this material should have sounded like....which was never trully realized by the Beatles themsleves. Let it be and Naked are not the final product because there is no final product ...it was shelved and released in 1970 as a final nail in the coffin.  NAKED is for the curious but not for a new generation of fans. Let it Be the film will most likely do what this CD does not and that is to reveal the true essance of a Beatles project who's intentions never trully evolved into a finished piece.
0345457684|5.0|At the risk of gushing, this was at the top of my list of &quot;Best Recent Reads&quot; for a long time. It's since moved to second, but considering I read it 6 months ago, that's pretty good.<br />Taut action scenes in a nicely fleshed-out future world make for a great read. At the same time, the well considered implications of technology that offer drastic changes to the way we view the mind and the self make for a much more thought-provoking and interesting read than your traditional hard-boiled detective novel.<br />The day I finished the paperback edition of this, I was online searching for the sequel. Too bad the UK gets it first! But a March release in the US promises to make an excellent birthday gift to myself.
B00005QK3W|2.0|I don't like to be unkind because the man has given me much listening pleasure and exhilaration over time (especially as a Beatle)...however... this little number has upset me a bit... 30 years of self-indulgent waste by all 4 ex-Beatles is what I feel. The magic that was the Beatles was never matched by their solo 'careers'....Had the real spirit of the age departed by the end anyway?...However, some solo efforts, like 'Flaming Pie', 'Ram', 'Band on the Run', 'Walls and Bridges' and 'Cloud Nine', had highlights. .... <BR>As to this album: lack of logical sequence or continuity of tracks; slapdash production; lyrically threadbare and shallow; poor structure in some songs; lacking in joy. Actually, listen to the last 30 seconds of 'Rinse the Raindrops', which has potential of what might have been... If only..
B000002UUX|5.0|This is one of the most amazing CD's I have ever bought. At first, I only had Countdown to Extinction, which is also an awesome CD. But I read an interview with Dave Mustaine(God of Metal, for sure) and he was asked how we would rate all of his albums out of 10. He gave a 10/10 to CTE, Peace Sells...But Whos Buying? and Rust in Peace. That same day I went out to buy both of those CD's. Boy was I rewarded. They are some of the best CD's that I've ever bought. <br />Holy Wars...The Punishment Due is a song thats definetly not to be missed. My favorite Megadeth song ever!<BR>Hangar 18 has incredible solos. <BR>Take No Prisoners has a killer intro. <BR>Poison Was the Cure is a very good thrash song, though the lowpoint of the album, but still good! <BR>Lucretia has awesome guitars and one of my favorites. <BR>Tornado of Souls just has to be heard to believe. <BR>Dawn Patrol is a great song with good bass. <BR>And finally, Rust in Peace... Polaris has some amazing drums. People, get this album right now, watch out Metallica, Megadeth Rules! <BR>If there was one Thrash CD to buy ever, this would be it, with crunching riffs, and mindblowing solos, this album is amazing.
B00005JMFO|5.0|i thought that this film was brilliant it was funny, sad and had a real feel good factor about it! The cast were amazing especially Hugh Grant because he's gorgeous.But i thought the star of the film was Bill Nighy, he was hillarious. I have now seen this film 4 times and i think its one you can watch over and over again. Truly genius writing and directing by Richard Curtis i think he's great and i love all of his films. I love Hugh grant,I love Hugh Grant, I love Hugh Grant.
B00001QEFU|5.0|My favorite band when I was a kid. This is their best album. It has a 70's punk/metal feel.<br />My favorite lyric (&quot;Tear it Loose&quot;): &quot;I'm grabbin' hold of all the gold in this old world of trash.&quot;<br />I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about - the original, Secret Records mix is tinny and horrible. The Atlantic mix (overseen by Mark Mendoza) is great.
0385504209|5.0|I just finished reading the Da Vinci Code and was so pleased with the experience, I am starting Angels and Demons.  (By the way, I was surprised to learn Angels and Demons takes place a year before the Da Vinci Code and has the same main character.)<br />What is enjoyable about the book is how Dan Brown exposes us to theories and research about religion that are not mainstream.  The story is well constructed with a wonderful balance of fact and fiction.  It will take you into a facinating world of symbolism and art...and may even challenge your point of view.<br />For example, in the story, an interesting perspective on the painting \\"The Last Supper\\" is introduced that makes you think about it in a whole new way...Trust me, if you haven't heard about this twist already, when you read this part of the book you will put it down imediately to look at the painting online.  Then you will do a double take and ask yourself \\"How did I ever miss that?\\"  The book is filled with moments like this.<br />What adds to the enjoyment of this book is the puzzles Dan Brown created online.  All you need is the book and some time.  Then, go to Dan Brown's web site where you actually find a scavanger hunt of knowledge that has you look at the cover of his book in new ways.<br />If you like mind puzzles and codes, you will love his website ([...]) and how he hid messages on the very cover of his book.<br />This is a fun read.  Open your mind, relax and take the book in for what it is...A fun mystery filled with puzzles, interesting opinions and enjoyable characters.<br />I highly reccomend this book!
B0000CFW87|5.0|I thought his debut CD was okay, but I absolutely love his sophomore album. One song in particular, &quot;Broken Vow&quot; is on repeat in my CD player, and the wrenching lyrics and sweeping melody have reduced me to tears. Please, Mr. Groban, be on Broadway or a movie musical.
B000002IKR|5.0|I'm writing this review to answer the many questions, or rather, concerns i've seen here, on the reason why Testament never went really big. The most likely reason these guys never got as big as Slayer, Metallica, Anthrax, and Megadeth, was probably due to the fact that they came into the the genre a little too late (this album was debuted on like 1987, give or take). About the time these guys were coming out, and making an appearance, grunge and the alternative rock movements were coming right in, and MTV was getting gayer than it already is. The media, and the crowd who follows them (which im sad to say is many people) were getting distasteful of metal. They wanted to hear more of guys such as Nirvana, Alice In Chains, and other grunge/alternative rock bands. So yea....just so you guys were wondering
B0000VAFO0|5.0|Nope, I haven't seen this flick yet...  But I will be seeing it sometime soon, because Kate Beckinsale is a hottie, and whomever doesn't think Vampires fighting Werewolves is cool, needs their head examined!<br />Good stuff!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Alot of people just don't like Britney... for whatever reason. Maybe they just hate being ugly and want to be pretty. Maybe they're jealous for some INSECURE reason. Some of the reviews I've read for this CD are like.. &quot;horrible. terrible. blah blah&quot;  Those are the people who listen to Hilary Duff and Chumbawamba.. and Christina Aguilera, like she's such a role model. Give me a break. And the funny thing is.. until now, I dismissed Britney as another lame trl mtv kiss @ss. If you're into funky, hip, cool semi-techno-ish pop that's actually GOOD, then pick this one up. Forget the haters. If they're calling it trash.. they haven't listened to it. By the way, the whole point in being an artist is to evolve in your craft and try different things. This is why Madonna is still around.
B000002KOO|5.0|Green played with his heartstrings - blue me away when it came out - still blows me away- one of those space time phenomena that occur rarely- never ages and never will- has everything -melody, guts and most of all FEELING- you can't go wrong
0060537639|5.0|The claims made by the author are very well substiantiated in the text. That the Chinese circumnavigated the world and discovered North and South Americs, the islands of the Carribean, Azores, Cape Verde Islands, Australia, New Zealand and Antartica, and many other places, decades or centuries before Europeans relying on copies of Chinese maps, found the same places, appears certain.<br />That the Chinese established settlements in many of the new lands encountered also seems obvious. Indeed, the links between the great South American civilisations and Chinese exploration invites a closer look.<br />The book is extremely well researched, well written and interesting. On the evidence presented, it is clear that the Spanish, Portugeuse and English have wrongly appropriated the credit that is due to the Chinese. Relevant conventionally accepted Histories are wrong and must be corrected.   <br />The culture and ethos of the Chinese in obtaining influence with leaders of other lands through the device of trade and kindness is very pleasing. Chinese culture contrasts sharply with the barbarity and cruelty of Europeans, Christians, who readily used terror to plunder the property and to eradicate or damage civilisations unlike their own.
0385474547|4.0|i wouodnt say that i really enjoyed this book a lot but i would say it enlightened me to what colonists did to the African Culuture. they took away what they thought important and implanted their own ideals. all in all i appreciate this book for the truth and partially a realistic vision.
0385512104|4.0|When I read about this book I thought it would be a real Who Done It sort of mystery.  Well it's not that sort of mystery. Early in the book the identity of the person who killed the dog is revealed, after that the real story begins.  It was fasinating to learn how one particular higher level austic child's mind operates.  It was also troubling how  having a handicapped child can effect a marriage.  This is a very good book.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I thought I'd throw my two cents in, as though there hasn't been enough said about this album already :) Here's a good rule of thumb for you listeners. If you see a reviewer mention Metallica, \\"nu-metal\\", or anything that alludes to the notion that Dream Theater  \\"took a step backward\\", that's your sure sign that this is a reviewer that doesn't really \\"get\\" music. Dream Theater and Metallica both include guitarists in their lineups. That's where the similarity ends. \\"Nu-metal\\" bands and Dream Theater both include guitarists in their lineups. Again, that's where the similarity ends. If you can't tell the difference between Disturbed and Dream Theater, do us all a favor and stop writing reviews. To be sure, this record is a bit different than Dream Theater's other releases. If you're a real musician, or someone who truly appreciates and finds themselves moved by good music, you understand when a band changes things up a bit. That's called growth, folks. If you don't like heavier music, feel free to not like it as much as some of the earlier stuff, but if you're going to write a review, at least understand the difference between a poorly written and performed album and one that just doesn't do it for you personally.
B00000JLWW|4.0|This movie is an excellent movie that represents a huge amount of work to produce such a stunning portrayal of the Titanic. This movie is about the tragic Titanic accident, but it is based around the lives of two young people who get onto the ship in very different ways. <br />Rosa Dawson is a beautiful woman who is a member of a rich family of nobility. She arrives on the Titanic because she is engaged to a rich man who will accompany her on the ship. <br />Jack is a poor Irish young man who luckily gets a ticket to go onto the Titanic by winning a card game. He is elated and arrives on the ship seeking an adventure in his nomadic life. He is a 3rd class passenger, although for him he's very lucky. <br />Jack sees Rose on the ship from below on the lower deck, and is immediately entranced by her beauty. Later, Jack saves Rose's life and they engage in a romance that perils Rose's relationship with her fiance. What ensues is a wonderful love story that develops. <br />The quality of this movie is superb and all the elements of the ship were recreated and look very realistic. The Titanic is touted to be &quot;unsinkable&quot; and is the most lavish ship of its time. However, the sailing of this amazing ship goes awry. If you haven't seen this classic movie then you must see it. I would caution against letting young kids see it as there's some adult material in here (some nudity and lots of sensual activity). My reason for only giving 4 stars is that the movie gets slow at parts (is very long at more than 3 hours) and the DVD is devoid of special features or any extras.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|After seeing the series botched by Fox on TV and then seeing the DVD's makes me realize what a real tragedy it was that FireFly was canceled. The character development, interaction and taking into account that the world of the future is not some antiseptic star fleet utopia or completely dominated by white European culture makes the series all the more enjoyable. Where there are people there is going to be dirt, mud and shipping containers scattered about.<br />I hope that any future movie can live up to the standards of series. I think it was a magical combination of cast, crew and writing that made this series special. It is going to be hard to duplicate it.
B00005JM02|4.0|This movie is another excellent Pixar production.  The themes of losing a mother and getting kidnapped may be too much for kids.
B00005JKG7|4.0|(spoiler ahead)..I saw this when I was a kid, and the scene at the house on the pier, with the babysitter and the little boy, left me terrified of, let's see...night, windows, fog, knocks at the door...for years to come.  It's a masterpiece of a scene--the build up, the music, the narrow escape, and the unexpected demise of the babysitter.  Just watched movie again recently, and it holds up well.  OK, the script is no masterpiece, but it's practically &quot;All About Eve&quot; compared to other slasher movies of the time.  Carpenter has some great horror set-pieces here and, as with &quot;Halloween&quot; and &quot;Christine&quot;, does a decent job of giving his characters some life.  Cool cast, wicked music score.  Exciting to have this in Panavision widescreen at long last!
B00000JLWW|3.0|A great movie with stunning visual effects, but where are the &quot;extras&quot;?  I expected more from Mr. Cameron than what this DVD offered.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Composer Howard Shore treats us to one final score in the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, a score every bit as beautiful and fantastic as that he wrote for the first two films. I couldn't imagine these films with any other composer doing the music -- from the heroic melody as Sauron's tower falls to the echoing of the Fellowship theme when Frodo awakens in Rivendell, this score was spot-on perfect.<br />The CD also includes brief snippets of song from the actors in the film -- Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn does a chant at his coronation, and Billy Boyd's Pippin sings a haunting tune, almost a dirge, as Denethor sends his son Faramir on what is almost certainly a suicide mission.<br />The album also includes the now-famous Annie Lennox track. I've never been a particular fan of Lennox, but like the Enya tune in \\"Fellowship of the Ring,\\" her contribution to this album is undeniable.<br />Fans of the films have already begun purchasing this album in droves, there's nothing I can say they don't know all ready. But if you're on the fence, trying to make up your mind, rest assured, this is worth it.
B00005N7Z1|3.0|First time I've ever watched this movie, and I only watched it cos I got it as a Christmas present. I was surprised how good it was! OK, it's a bit slow to start with, and I was getting slightly annoyed with the constant TV news clips.<br />I got the box set of the trilogy, and found there were two versions of the film to watch - the theatrical version and the director's cut. Which isn't something you often see on DVDs. Of course, I chose the director's cut, and regretted it. My dad had seen the original, so he was noticing the bits that weren't in the original. And I couldn't look at the screen, especially when Murphy was getting shot to smithereens. It was so graphic! You can see why it was probably sliced when it went to the cinemas. I didn't really notice what else was maybe sliced out.<br />Nancy Allen also stars in this. It took me a while to place her, as she a very severe, bad 80s haircut in this, but when I did place her, I couldn't believe it! It's Chris Hargensen from Carrie! The bad girl who pulled the rope on the bucket of blood.<br />Towards the end, you also see Robocop take off his headgear, which I hated, due to the fact that his face is so stretched! Ugh. Not a pretty sight.<br />I've always heard this film compared to Terminator. It is slightly. I found myself sympathising and feeling sorry for Robocop, the same way I did with the Terminator (mainly in the second &amp; third movies though). Robocop evokes the same feelings in you that happened during Terminator - if you don't have a heart of stone that is.<br />The action only really starts towards the end of the movie, and you feel so sorry as you watch Robocop have flashbacks of his previous life etc. But after watching the first one, I'm glad I have the second one to watch when I feel like it - I've been told bad things about the final in the trilogy!
B00008WG3U|5.0|I really liked the new NoFx CD because of its political stance, for me politics are really an important element into the punk-rock culture and into the writing of punk-rock, well, they showed the good example! HEY YOU PUNK! stop writing stupid songs about girls! Get your band on tour and inform people of what's really going on! The message of The War on Errorism is clear:WE GOT TO WAKE UP TODAY!!!!!!!! In other way, the NoFx is awesome!
B000000WI6|5.0|1991 wasn't a really good year for blues but this album as well as John Lee Hookers &quot;The Healer&quot; continued to burn the flame during that dark peroid.<BR>  EVERY track on this one is totally fabulous...Johnnys voice is at its peak, his guitar work is incendiary and the greatest thing about this album is the feeling throughout that Johnny and his band ( who are also 100% superb!) are really enjoying every moment of it.<BR> Billy Branchs harp work is stunning and Dr. Johns piano is practically in flames, especially on that last track &quot; You Lie Too Much&quot; (c.d version only/bonus track).<BR>  This c.d goes so well together with Johnnys two previous c.ds &quot; Guitar Slinger&quot; and the merciless &quot;Third Degree&quot;...they all have the same very high level of energy.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This is a must-have for any Led Zeppelin fan, or classic rock fan for that matter.  The Song Remains the Same was a rather poor effort from the best rock band ever, so it is nice to see that they finally captured the essence of Zep. on video.  In addition to this, it's in Dolby 5.1, so turn it up!  As I have read in many reviews, the DVD's will leave you wanting more.  This couldn't be more accurate.  I will wear these DVD's out through over-use.  By it.........now!
B00005JM0B|2.0|Typical.  The studio apparently thought that the first two movies were blockbusters because of the chase scenes, not the plot or development.  So what does the studio do?  Cram the movie full of mindless and seemingly endless chase scenes (largely a variation on the first two movies .. the obligatory motorcycle chase, trucks, etc.) tied together with some flimsy pretexts and forget to put in an interesting plot.  I thought that this movie was a turkey. Rent the DVD, don't buy it. One viewing is more than enough. And if you saw the movie, you know why not to even bother renting the DVD!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I don't usually write reviews since I figure there are more than enough people sharing their opinions to render mine repeative no matter what I say. However, in the case of Firefly, the more people who voice their love for the show, the greater the hope of making some Fox Suit somewhere realize their horrible mistake in killing this incredible show before it got the chance to really fly. I just recently finished watching this DVD set that I bought on a whim and I'm absolutely blown away. It's an amazing show, with witty scripts, a fantastic score (I *love* the theme song. It's the only show where I watch the credits every single time and I admit with no shame that I often sing along) and beautiful special effects. However, the best thing is the incredible cast. As others have said, they created a family that the viewer loves dearly in just 14 episodes and it nearly breaks your heart to have to say goodbye to them after such a short time. Everything about it is absolutely outstanding.<br />I believe this show easily would have become Joss Whedon's masterpiece (and that's saying a lot since I'm a loyal &quot;Buffy&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; fan) if it had been given half a chance and not deliberately sabotaged by Fox. It is nothing short of brilliant and so refreshingly new. I eagerly anticipate the upcoming movie and I continue to hope that maybe this show will get a second chance if the fanbase becomes large enough and loud enough. Mal said it, &quot;Doing the impossible makes us mighty.&quot; <br />Check out this show! I cannot recommend it highly enough. In edition to the amazing show itself, there are quite a few great extra features on this DVD Set, including entertaining commentaries and a very well done documentary.
B000083E79|1.0|I bought this album out of pressure as a gay man because EVERY gay man is supposed to like Cher. I have even tried to like her but think her voice is terrible and her songs lame. Believe has to be the most overrated song in recent memory. I like the version they play on South Park much better. I give the one star to Dark Lady because it is the best song on the album.
B000005HO0|5.0|You can read that the black metal masterpiece is de misteriis dom sathanas, by these same artists. And we can put that jewel in the second place, but the real place in that throne belongs to live in leipzig.<BR>It could sounds weird to give that honors to a live album, but you must consider that this is the only Mayhem album with its true formation: Hellhammer (best drummer ever in metal), great Necrobutcher in the bass, Dead, a demon singing (perfect raw voice for raw music) and well, Euronymous does not need any presentation; HAIL EURONYMOUS!!! see you in hell my master!<BR>This is a sound extremely dark, cold and strong; here we found some of the greatest masterpieces in black metal, as funeral fog, freezing moon or pagan fears, but every song should have its own article.<BR>You can also read the lyrics and found the darker poetry ever made!!!! this albums is a perfect black art, Just hear it loud, in a dark room and you will fall in trance.<BR>I you are one of those kids who think you are a bad, evilfull metaller because you hear bands so &quot;wicked&quot; as korn or slipknot, jejeje dont hear this one; you will run claiming for mercy with your ears bleeding and dying of terror.<BR>as said once the grat Euronymous: &quot;true metal for true followers&quot;
0385504209|1.0|Alexander Pope once said  \\"a little learning can be a dangerous thing.\\"  How true that is.  Like others, including Oliver Stone, Brown has taken  a few interesting bits of historical information mixed with some out-right fabrication and attempted to form a conspiracy of sorts, involving the Catholic Church and among others: Constantine, Mary Magdalene, Victor Hugo, Leonardo da Vinci and even Walt Disney.<br />The trouble, of course, with this kind of fast and loose investigation in which the presumption that because A follows b then b must have caused a, is that it more often than not leads to mistaken conclusions.<br />Ah, but this is a work of fiction, you say.  That  does not seem  to be the message that Mr. Brown is spreading as he markets his novel. I suppose that the belief that this nonsensical pulp could be based on reality is essential to sales.  So let that old caveat \\"buyer beware\\" continue to be your warning.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|FOX Broadcasting @#$%! and this show rocks.<BR>The only bad thing about this dvd set is on the box where it says &quot;The Complete Series&quot; instead of &quot;Season One&quot;.<br />A great space western. Cool characters, witty script. Many quotable lines. I hated watching the last show and realizing there would be no more. It is unbelievable that this show was picked out of the sludge heap that is FOX's lineup and cancelled while so much garbage continues being made.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Words can't describe what this album means to me. It's kinda like a diary, every song is about something that I have lived and felt on my own skin. And about the music, it's perfectly produced and Christina really sings her heart out in every song. Christina Aguilera is so underestimated and misunderstood, it hurts me to see that a lot of people can't see how great she is. She's not just a powerful voice, she's an extremely intelligent woman who knows how to use the precious gifts God gave to her: her singing and songwriting skills. She's a true artist, she wrote and produced every song on this album (besides &quot;Impossible&quot; - written by Alicia Keys and &quot;Beautiful&quot; - written by Linda Perry) and she sings with so much passion and emotion, she's such a creative performance artist like Madonna and a talented vocalist like Mariah Carey, trust me when I say that she's about to become a Legend, because nobody else is that talented. If some people still think that she's a Teen Idol then they need to open their minds and listen to this album, I still haven't found a single person who disliked it. I actually had the chance to see her when she performed here in Italy and damn, that was the best day of my entire life: she's truly the best. Christina Aguilera.........a woman, a Legend!
B00006LSM3|5.0|I'm not one to overrate things and give everything I like a lot a full 5 stars, but this album really deserves it. A beautiful and haunting swan song to Harrison's legendary life and career, &quot;Brainwashed&quot; serves as a powerful statement from a spiritual man who knows he is dying. There are several gems here: &quot;Pisces Fish,&quot; &quot;Looking for My Life,&quot; and &quot;Stuck Inside a Cloud&quot; are melodic tunes with the depth of lyrics by an artist with a terminal illness. &quot;Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea&quot; is a fun rendition of an old standard (complete with George's beloved ukulele). The title track is a lively telling of living in the material world, capped off by a beautiful, soothing traditional Hindu chant that closes the album. <br />But it is the masterpiece &quot;Rising Sun&quot; that anchors the whole album, and which -- in my humble opinion -- ranks up there as among the best in the Harrison canon. With a lovely melody, deep and profound lyrics, and wonderful instrumentation, I don't think I could ever say enough about how great this song is. So I won't even try; just listen to it and pay attention to the words. This is a song that will often be covered by other artists.<br />With the music business in the state it's in today, leave it to a Beatle to show current &quot;artists&quot; how it's done. This is one of the great Beatle solo albums. If you're a Harrison fan, or a Beatle fan, or just a fan of good and profound music, this CD belongs in your collection.
B00008PW2D|1.0|First, I want to say that I am a big fan of the series and am predisposed to purchasing the DVD set, BUT, the cost just sticks in my craw.<br />Unlike many other reviewers, I enjoyed the seasons shows and was disappointed that there were so few.<br />What really gets me is the producers of the fifth season have decided to stick it to the most loyal fans of the series by charging the same price for fewer then half the number of episodes.<br />Very shady business practices. I don't think it is the financial best interests of the people who make these DVD's to alienate the people most likely to buy the damn things.<br />I for one refuse to be ripped off.
B000099T2L|5.0|This CD proves that Beyonce is here to stay her CD is great. I love every song from &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; to &quot;Speachless&quot;. she has a variety of songs for average people for someone who loves their mate with all their heart to someone who is tired of all of their mate's bull. She picks up on the on every scene of this musical era.
B000092Q4U|5.0|This is the best &quot;metal&quot; CD of 2003. I quote &quot;metal&quot; because that's what it's closest to, but this incorporates all the best of heavy music from punk to death to grind to melodic. These guys know what they are doing - again! The first 2 CD's were just as pummeling and smart. I'll be at the store when/if they release anything else. I've heard about a DVD, but don't see it here. No dissapointment here.
0780020685|5.0|The apex of Japanese Cinema.  Never in all my life have i seen a finer film from this era.  When a village learns of an attack, they hire seven samurai to protect them.  Akira Kurosawa will forever be remembered as the genius who created this timeless classic.  <BR>I just wanted to say that Seven Samurai is NOT a Kung Fu.  The battle sequences are not made to show one man beating up thirty agressors.  The samurai movies show the frailty of life.  They show that even the greatest warriors can be defeated.  So please never compare a movie about samurai to a Chuck Norris or Bruce Lee flick again.<BR>Also to those who complain about the way the movie was filmed, it was 1954.  There were no special effects that existed at the time.  Movies had to have plots.  One person attempts to compare Seven Samurai to Wing Commander, nominated for worst movie of the year, saying that wing commander had better special effects.  Wing Commander was made in the 90's.  it should have better effects, but the fact of the matter is, wing commander had a horriable story.  Seven Samurai is a brillent motion picture. Wing Commander sucked. To whoever tried to compare these two movies i would like to ask never write a review for a classic movie again.  You just are not intelligent enough to understand a complex plot.<BR>With all that said, Seven Samurai: One of the greatest movies ever made.
B00008H2LB|5.0|everyone has to buy this cd!!! this is the best band that ever came out....people say that they r bad but then that meens that they have No taste in music....so take it from me...BUY THIS CD.
B00008OWZC|5.0|This is the Rock Album release of 2003 by a country mile. This collection of songs stands head and shoulders above anything else during the last twelve months. The only disappointment being that it was not released thirty-one years ago, at the time of its recording.<br />Over the last thirty years the Led Zeppelin live selection available to the public has been extremely slim pickings. The best of them was some recordings from the dear old B.B.C., which, while not exactly bad, did not contain the excitement of a real in your face concert. The only official release during the band's `oh too brief' lifespan was 'The Song Remains The Same'. This was, if you like, a recording of the best band in the world playing one of the worst concerts they ever played. Other than that you had to rely upon bootlegs and sorting the good from the bad was not always easy. But with this release all has been put to rights.<br />This is a compilation of two concerts from June 1972, put together in the correct running order to show off an entire show of Led Zeppelin at the height of their powers playing in front of their rabid fans. Led Zeppelin was the finest rock band to ever tread the boards, and `How the West Was Won' catches them at their peak. Not only is this the rock release of 2003, but it also makes it the best live rock album ever. Full stop here - no arguments.<br />Each member of the band is brim full of confidence, skill, and comfort in their own abilities and those of their partners. Hard to believe they had only been together for just over three years, but had released five classic albums from which there is a selection from each here. These concerts were recorded on the `Houses of the Holy' tour. (The Songbook list was already overloaded with Cannon, and they still had to release `Physical Graffiti' and `Presence'. Listening you wonder what they are going to drop to put in 'Kashmir', etc.)<br />Robert Plant shows off confirming why he was the ultimate front man. With his unique voice with its yelps, yells  and none too subtle innuendo, he was often copied, but never bettered.<br />Jimmy Page is not only the finest and most versatile guitarist, but leaves you in no mind, who the leader was of this crew.<br />John Paul Jones often does not get the credit he deserves, but as well as being such a jolly useful chap with his multi-instrumental talent, he also helped co-write many of Zeppelin's classic tracks.<br />John Bonham is awesome. His drumming throughout is superb and his stamina breathtaking. His almost twenty minute drum solo in 'Moby Dick' leaves all other drum solos in the dirt. (Not forgetting that the opening guitar lick of `Moby Dick' most bands would make a career out of.)<br />What you get, spread over three discs; ten songs on disc one, four on disc two, and four on disc three. That may sound a bit unfair, but then on disc two you get 'Dazed and Confused' clocking in at over twenty-five minutes and 'Moby Dick' at just under twenty minutes. Led Zeppelin go through the full range of their material from the acoustic songs that come at the end of disc one, the cosmic blues of 'Since I've been Loving You'. The majestic 'Stairway to Heaven' (I know you've heard it a thousand times, but only these four guys can get it right) to the let your hair down let's all go mad of 'Rock and Roll'.<br />Highlights over the three discs are far too many to mention, but for this dog the complete twenty-three minutes of the 'Whole Lotta Love' medley, and directly after the storming opener of `Immigrant Song', when Jimmy Page goes directly into the guitar riff of `Heartbreaker', `DANG DANG DANG DANG DA-DA-DANG, DA-DA-DA-DA-DA DANG DANG DA-DA-DANG' are the absolute pinnacle of Rock and Roll bliss. (Skip back and read the DANG DANG bit again and you know I'm right.) During happy hour at Tahitian Queen, when `Heartbreaker' slams its way out of the speakers, look around and you can see everybody is reaching for their air guitars as their heads rock back. One listen to this collection and you can hear `How The West Was Won' by Led Zeppelin in the early seventies. If this is not enough for you, don't forget there is an accompanying DVD simply titled Led Zeppelin with over five hours of different unreleased material, which is spread over Led Zeppelins entire career. Happy Daze indeed.<br />Mott the Dog.rock back. One listen to this collection and you can hear `How The West Was Won' by Led Zeppelin in the early seventies. If this is not enough for you, don't forget there is an accompanying DVD simply titled Led Zeppelin with over five hours of different unreleased material, which is spread over Led Zeppelins entire career.

B0000DD7LB|4.0|i'm a guy. i like rock. i like hip-hop. however, i'm really a fan of all music. i'm not so much into pop, but do pay attention to the sales and artistic quality of the artists out there. let's go back to 1999 when britney first topped the charts. her bubble gum pop album &quot;...baby one more time&quot; sold over 10 million copies and crowned britney the princess of pop. full of shock and surprise, britney's career as transformed over the years. what's more, her album sales have as well. britney's third album, &quot;britney&quot;, only sold 3+ million copies, a far cry from the diamond status of her debut. however, spears has grown as an artist. she actually has a part in writing her music now. her songs have more meaning when she sings them, because they are now based on her experiences. ironically, britney has gotten better since her 1999 debut, but her album sales don't show it. even more, she struggles to get radio airplay. everyone seems interested in britney the person and not britney the artist. but i suggest you listen to her new album, and then compare it with the rest of her material. the ballad &quot;everytime&quot; stands out on the album and should be released eventually as a single, while &quot;outrageous&quot; and &quot;toxic&quot; offer trip hop dance vibes that could ignite any club. on &quot;shadow&quot; britney showcases an alternative beat that stands her current work apart from her old music. overall, the album is not exactly your american classic, but it accounts for a change within britney. who was once a puppet and a girl has grown into a woman who has begun to explore herself as an artist. watch out - the real britney is beginning to surface.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Ok, Let me start off by saying I HATE POP MUSIC. I hate britney, Christina,Avril Lavigne, and everyone else because pop music is music gone retarded. There is no REAL music in there.. And besides, Britney cannot sing. I bet you they just fix up her voice in the recording studio and add affects since she has no real voice, Unlike Christina. I'm more into Rap, Rock &amp; Metal. But when my friends said this cd was &quot;pretty good&quot; I decided to give it a try. They were right! It's kinda goOd. And it has great dance beats if you're like me and take Dance classes. You could really use this to make up a routine. Anyways, I would have to say &quot;Boom Boom&quot; and &quot;Me against the music&quot; are prob. the best songs on this cd. And I think Britney with that MTV awards kiss was just to get publicity, Just like when they reported she got &quot;Married&quot; in Vegas. *Tsk tsk* What pop stars would do these days to get attention. Oh well, Buy the Cd and see if you like it. If you're a pop fan and a britney fan OF COURSE you will like this Cd.
0859652777|5.0|This book tells a lot about Marilyn Manson and his life growing up and his family. I read this book quite a few years ago and I can't believe noone has reviewed it yet. Great book and even some good pictures.
0553573403|4.0|I usually shy away from fantasy, but I read this one and the next book in this series because of all the shining reviews posted here.  I have yet to be sorry, so thanks everyone! for their reviews encouraging me to read it.<br />  At the center of the story lies the Stark family in the North, who are tied very closely to the King of the Iron Throne.  The books title pretty much sums up the very basic plot.  Who should continue to sit on the Iron Throne is a matter of dispute between several houses, and continues on in the next book &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;.<br />  A few of the reviewers here are disappointed with the book because of its lack of fantastical elements.  I agree with them, there is little fantasy here in the way of dragons, magic and things like that.  The places are obviously made up, but that aside I think this book reads like a historical fiction novel.  It's very political and this coupled with the overall missing fantasy is what made me really like this book.<br />  I also think it is really clever of Martin to switch points of view throughout the book.  Each chapter deals exclusively with the thoughts and situations of a different character (Martin has several he switches out) as they struggle with not only political problems, but personal ones as well.  This form of writing manages to keep the plot working smoothly.<br />  If you like lengthy, disciplined reading that isn't literature, then you will probably like this book.
0316096199|3.0|I read this book strictly because I am a rape survivor.  I was raped in June of 2003.  My attack and rape were so similar to Seebold's that it was eerie.  One aspect of rape therapy is to re-tell your own story; re-write it.  However, when you are attacked so brutally and aren't 'supposed' to be alive, the re-telling is difficult.  Events are lost in memory almost as quickly as they occur.  The brain is too preoccupied with  dying as painlessly as possible, while simultaneously looking for any escape (at least in my own case).  <BR>Because of the way that my brain functioned under such duress, I am finding this book to be a useful tool lately.  As I re-read Seebold's account of her own rape, I am better able to remember. I can say, 'yes! exactly what happened!'  or 'no, I did this instead.'  I write in the margins.  I do it for personal use, to better help in my own recovery.  If you are a survivor, I would ask your counselor if she recommends this for you.  It is helping me now.  Hence, on that score, this book has been invaluable to me.<br />However, I must agree with previous reviewers regarding the rather selfish tone of the author.  I also found her to be overly self-centered and amazingly insensitive to others around her.  I did get the impression that she really believed that she was the only one that had been hurt and even if she wasn't, her pain was the only pain that mattered (not just to her, but in general.)<br />Yet, it is important to remember that this is a *memoir* and not fiction.  Therefore, Ms. Seebold can only tell the story as it is.  If there is not much written on recovery, well, perhaps this is because there hasn't been much experience in the way of recovery.  <br />I would certainly not have picked this book up had I not shared a similar experience.  I read it the first time (within a week afer my own rape) merely for company.  To survive such an ordeal absolutely leaves you as a complete alien, walking in a daze in a world that you never expected to see again.  Merely associating with people around you -- co-workers, neighbors, your grocery store cashiers, etc., leaves you lonely for company of someone who has been just where you are.  Books like this one can fill this need initially.<br />To those who have survived such a rape and are interested in reading more, I must recommend the phenomenal book by Susan Brison called Aftermath.
B00008WG3U|5.0|This is easily my favorite CD. What I like about this CD is the diversity. Though it has many political songs, it also holds true to what NOFX is all about. Being pure punk, not that pop-punk crap. Among the best on this CD are Franco Un-American and We got two jealous agains. They simply have great playing and vocals all the way around.
B00006L83N|5.0|I must admit, I knew very little about these guys. It was by reading the reviews here, that I decided to give these guys a chance. All I can say is I was completely blown away by the vocals and musicianship the guys provide. You cannot really compare them to bands like Dream Theater. These guys are in a class all by themselves. I urge anyone who has not listened to them and wants to get into something different, pick this cd up and let it take control of you. You will not be sorry.
B00002E233|4.0|So many sci-fi/horror films since Aliens hit in 1986 have tried to take the formula of &quot;take a bunch of people, confine them with whatever killer beasts we can think of, and see who survives&quot;.  Rarely it comes off as enjoyable, but Deep Blue Sea is a surprisingly good sci-fi yarn that is entertaining and surprising until the credits roll.  The oh so hot Saffron Burrows plays an Altzheimers researcher who is experimenting on a trio of Mako sharks in the undersea complex of Aquatica.  However, some never thought of side effects have happened, and now she and the crew (which includes Thomas Jane, Samuel L. Jackson, LL Cool J, Stellan Skarsgard, Michael Rapaport, Jacqueline McKenzie, and The Soprano's Aida Turturro) are swimming for their lives.  Director Renny Harlin (Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2) pretty much does the same thing here that he did with Nightmare on Elm Street 4; sacrifice tension and suspense for blood and gore; but it surprisingly works.  The performances are great, and the special effects are good considering the time the film was released.  This is the film in which Jane would get noticed and his first in a leading action hero role which he has since followed in Dreamcatcher and the upcoming The Punisher, and his action hero talents are on high display.  All in all, Deep Blue Sea is worth checking out.
0345442970|3.0|\\"Cloak of Deception\\" is the first Star Wars novel that I have read.  This novel is set before the events of \\"The Phanton Menace\\" and set some things in motion which help better explain potential questions raised in the movie.  Some questions that get addressed in this book: \\"What is the deal with the Trade Federation?\\", \\"Why is Chancellor Valorum ineffective as the leader of the Senate?\\", \\"How does the Senator from such a small planet has such influence in the Senate?\\".<br />We are in the waning days of the Galactic Republic.  The Trade Federation has an absurd amount of power, influencing the Senate and maintaining control over trade lanes.  They are, in effect, a Galactic Monopoly.  Few in the Senate are willing to deal with this growing problem, but there are bands of terrorists attacking the Trade Federation in the Outer Rim.  Members of the Trade Federation have entered into an alliance with a mysterious figure only known as Darth Sidious.<br />The Jedi-Knight Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi get involved in one of the terrorist attacks and sensing a larger problem that is worth getting involved in, Qui-Gon defies the Jedi Council and continues to work to find the root of the terrorist problem and the Trade Federation.  Qui-Gon also foils an assassination attempt on Chancellor Valorum, and the implications of this event are far reaching.<br />I did not have very high expectations regarding this book.  I have not heard very many good things about the quality of the Star Wars novels.  The beginning of this novel was moderately weak as I didn't find any of the characters to be engaging at all (despite my familiarity with Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan).  They seemed to be simply acting, and Luceno was not very successful in revealing who these men, women, and aliens were.  About halfway through the novel, the story picked up a bit and I was able to get into it a bit more, and I enjoyed the book more than when I began.  It was good enough that I'm willing to try a few more Star Wars novels and try to work my way through the series for a while longer so that I can see what happens after the events of \\"The Return of the Jedi\\".  This isn't a great book, but it's not bad.  It is middle of the road science fiction set in the Star Wars universe.to try a few more Star Wars novels and try to work my way through the series for a while longer so that I can see what happens after the events of \\"The Return of the Jedi\\".

B00005JMCT|4.0|American Wedding, the third and final film in the American Pie series, is a bittersweet comedy.  Bittersweet because only half of the cast has returned (no Chris Klein, Tara Reid, Mena Suvari, Shannon Elizabeth, or Natasha Lyonne), but the film is surprisingly better without them.  American Wedding finds Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) graduating college and preparing to marry, but not before Stifler (Seann William Scott) can hatch a bachelor party and nearly ruin the nuptuals.  Thomas Ian Nicholas, Eddie Kaye Thomas, and Eugene Levy as Jim's dad return to add to the comic relief, even though Nicholas is hardly used at all.  Plenty of mishaps ensue naturally, and American Wedding almost becomes more of Scott's film (his performance goes from irritating to hilarious in the span of the film), but some of the gags (come on, the dog poop?) seem way out of place.  That aside though, American Wedding is the last, and the best, piece of pie, and it is a fitting farewell to this surprisingly funny and fresh mainstream comedy franchise.

You can experience wealth, health, romance, self-esteem, job success, creativity, and a life released from resentment and pain.\\" ~Louise L. Hay, author of You Can Heal Your Life<br /><br />If you are looking for a way to create more happiness in your life, these cards can inspire you on a daily basis. The beautiful tiny box holds 60 affirmation cards a variety of subjects. You can read about romance, wealth, health, forgiveness, creativity, overcoming stress, job success and self-esteem.<br /><br />Lately I've started to believe that you truly do hold the keys to your future. You can literally dream your future into life. Although, I am also convinced that you need a lot of encouraging books and encouraging people in your life to overcome life's immense and at times overwhelming hurdles. If you can find just one person who believes in you and a few books that bring an encouraging message into your life, you really can heal your world.<br /><br />Louise Hay shows this positive philosophy in her \\"I Can Do It Cards.\\" There are immediate and essential things you must do to heal your life. One of them is to encourage yourself daily. You can't give up and let yourself fall back into negative patterns that are defeating and harmful to your life. These cards encourage you to look at your life in a more positive way.<br /><br />The first card says: \\"Love is all there is!\\"<br />Then, on the back: \\"Love is powerful - your love and my love. Love brings us peace on Earth.\\"<br /><br />I adore this card:<br /><br />\\"I love myself exactly as I am. I no longer wait to be perfect in order to love myself.\\"<br />Back of Card: \\"The greatest gift I can give myself is unconditional love.\\"<br /><br />While we often hear that we should love others \\"unconditionally,\\" but how many times do we hear that we should love \\"ourselves unconditionally?\\" These cards are a wonderful reminder. The colors (lavender, blue, pink, yellow, green and orange) on these cards are beautiful and there are pictures on both sides. There are pictures of steaming cups of tea, sandy beaches, butterflies, angels, lots of hearts, treasure chests, flowers, birds, stars and I even found a picture of Louise's book: \\"You Can Heal Your Life.\\"<br /><br />The \\"I now do work I love, and I am well paid for it\\" card sounds just wonderful and I hope that reading this card will make some of my dreams come true in 2004.<br /><br />Louise L. Hay is a metaphysical lecturer and the best-selling author of 27 books. Her works have been translated into 25 languages.<br /><br />The \\"I Can Do It Cards\\" may just be what you need to move to a higher level in your awareness of life. There are so many beautiful places we can go. Sometimes we just need a little motivation. You can put these cards on your refrigerator, in your pocket, on a bulletin board, leave one on a co-workers desk or even slip them into a card for a friend. In that case, you might need two boxes. :)<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewutiful and there are pictures on both sides.

B000002J03|5.0|The band had so much to express so early on in their career, given that this album came out near the end of 1969, only about 9 months after LZ 1.  And the styles of both albums are nearly the same, except LZ 2 felt a bit more gritty, a little more \\"loud\\", not as forgiving.<br />  Unlike my opinion on LZ 1, LZ 2 was a more solid performance.  No \\"fading\\" in the second half.  And that also made it hard for me to pick a favorite.  Maybe Ramble On, or Living Loving Maid (She's Just A Woman).  And I also felt a bigger impression on Mr. Page.  It was just a feeling that he was more present in this one than the last.  Mentioning that, I shouldn't leave out John Bonham and Moby Dick.  Let's not forget his solo.  I picture the rest of the band leaving the stage and letting him do his thing for awhile, like in a certain concert.<br />  Just like LZ 1, I had somehow forgotten how great this album was, but then woke up to it once more.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|I was never a huge fan of the Strokes, so while my friend was spewing praises for them, I say back with cynical disbelief. However, upon finding a vinyl version of this album, I figured if I was to buy it, I should in style, and it sounds better for it. These guys aren't saviors, they are merely a band who plays tightly and writes songs that are retreads of earlier classics, yet sound like their own style. If you did not like their debut, there's a strong chance you will not like this album either. However, if you give them a chance, you may surprise yourself by enjoying &quot;Room On Fire&quot;. Can't wait to see how they follow this up...
B000002J1U|5.0|Quite possibly my favorite of their albums.  I remember when I first listened to LZ 3, I was unsure what to make of it... Friends, Celebration Day, Hats Off To (Roy) Harper.  There was an odd quality to it.  But I love it now, especially the background strings and vocals in Friends.  It makes me wonder what fans thought of this change in style back in 1970, when they were growing with the band, although they hadn't been around long yet.<br />  Immigrant Song would have to be one of my favorites of Led Zeppelin.  Out On The Tiles is so much fun.  Tangerine, That's The Way... the foursome showed more diversity and I respect that.  Maybe they had all of this creative energy and they stored it away for LZ 3, establishing #1 and #2 first.  I don't know if I like Hats Off To (Roy) Harper, yet.<br />  It is one of those albums where I just can't wait to hear the next song, having to slow myself and enjoy what's playing at the moment.  Could somebody please finally tell me how to pronounce Bron-Y-Aur?
B00008S2VG|1.0|Self-absorbed, cynical, horribly contrived, inconvincing posturing: Madonna has done all these before in her career, but very rarely on the same CD. American Life is a truly black eye on her otherwise stellar career, and one I'm sure she'll have problems topping. Her credibility is all but lost after a year of garbage: this album, a horrible first single whose controversial video was pulled, the Gap commercials (what the hell was Missy on??), and the whole Britney scandal. I mean, Madonna, shying away from controversy? Welcome to the 21st century, I guess. And that rap? Like Ed the Sock said, it was trying to be hip, but is the musical equivalent of a soccer mom in stretch pants. Ouch. Garbage.
B00009TB5G|5.0|It's a wonderful thing that the makers of this DVD decided to trust the public and incorporate the &quot;deleted scenes&quot; into the movie, where they belong.  It's also very fine that they chose to add so many scenes that help us know and understand the characters and the depth of the story, instead of just more action scenes.  Not that I don't like the action, but this is a story of great human interest, of courage, compassion, amazing strength of character.  This comes through with much greater impact than in the &quot;cinema&quot; version.  The relationships between the characters are much more filled out and their depth is easier to comprehend.  The trust they have in eachother and the support they give one another is more representative of what is found in the books. <br />I'm glad they did these extended versions, and I appreciate their length.  After all, if you need a bathroom break, there is always a pause button.
B00005ASHM|5.0|One of the truly hyped albums of all time that lives up to the lavish praise heaped upon it. Brian Wilson was a 23-year-old who was struggling to express himself in new aural forms, and made this masterwork. Somewhat surprisingly, it flopped. The liner notes detail the reasons: kitsch cover (no doubt), automatic dislike of anything &quot;Beach Boys&quot; by those that would have liked it the most - hippies. It also paints Brian in a glowing light as working alone, without a songwriting partner like the Lennon/McCartney team, or without a guiding producer like George Martin. That he was such a young man working alone, against the advice of his manager, and created such a beautiful album is truly a testament to his musical genius. The songs speak for themselves, and everyone should know them by heart.
B00006LI4S|5.0|Tis dvd is a must have for pink floyd fans... and dont be fooled by the lonestar artist performance... his solo carrier is as good as together with the pink floyd...
0141304642|1.0|First of all, and BY FAR, worst of all, on page 21, Mrs. Silver says that she will be Mr. Hoppy's \\"slave for life\\" if he can make Alphie bigger.  Mr. Hoppy repeats this over and over and is thrilled and motivated to perform his scheme when he hears this.  Its awful because no woman and no person, even, should be a slave to anyone.  It also stresses debt and obligation that one person has towards someone else, which is fufilled at the end when she enters into a marriage with this guy.<br />Which brings me to my second point, Mrs. Silver didn't even know Mr. Hoppy and accepts his proposal.  This is unrealistic and doesn't teach kids anything real life.  Prior to that, too, Mr. Hoppy loves this woman and doesn't know anything about her.  In reality, this kinds of infatuation and scheming is actually more scary than anything else.  It actually sets a bad example for kids about the progression of real life relationships.  And what is love?  This book does nothing to expose kids to the true nature of love; Dahl equates love with infatuation.  <br />Its also a shame how the female protagonist is portrayed.  Mrs. Silver is painted as really gullible (she believes Mr. Hoppy and his spells and offers her life away as property for him because of it).  She's also so stupid that she doesn't even notice that the tortoise she loves she much is growing.  <br />Also, keeping the 140 turtles piled on top of one another eating \\"thick old cabbage leaves\\" isn't good for the tortoises and doesn't teach kids anything about proper care and respect towards animals.  The fact that Mr. Hoppy returns the tortoises to the pet shops doesn't say much for responsibility towards one's pets either.<br />Mr. Hoppy is actually a really sketchy character who fits the profile of a stalker: he's got nothing in his own life (and no furniture), he spies on Mrs. Silver, he knows what hours she works, etc.  I was so surprised that Mr. Hoppy gets away with his scheme.  They live happily ever after with this lie between them, and it shows kids that he can keep with secret from the woman he loves and still be happy (he is not punished for his wrongdoing, but instead rewarded).  I waited to the end to be surprised by Dahl because I was hoping Mr. Hoppy would fess up with Mrs. Silver about his life, but, nope, didn't happen.<br />All in all, I was very disappointed, and I don't think this book is good for children.  It was a sad waste of 15 minutes of my life, and then this took another 15+ minutes to write, but the complaints needed to aired...
B0000C6E4D|3.0|I had to say, this is not one of Sarah's best albums.  One thing, as I'm sure many have said, is that the album lacks a stylistic element that made the other albums so distinguished from the other artists.  This album, quite frankly, sounds like everything else - it's trendy, not very bold, and while it does all the essential things well, it doesn't have that edge that motivated me to listen to the album again and again.  Honestly, I've listened to it about 8 times and I'm got my Sarah kick - it's done and over with.<br />Now, I guess I'm being overly harsh, but I should be!  I mean, this is Sarah McLachlan, the pillar of all female vocalists in the alternative style of music in my opinion.  For me, Sarah is the clash between sweetness, a great artistic style and music that you can invest your emotions into - at least it used to be.  I remember how I felt when I listened to Fumbling Towards Ecstacy or even less so, Surfacing.  Songs on those albums had a distinguished edged that defined Sarah as something I could appreciate. <br />You see, I'm a musician and even more so, I'm not even your typical Sarah fan.  I don't even listen to the words for the most part - I listen to sounds, melodies, progressions and the general mesh of everything together.  I can honestly say that I listened to Fumbling 30 times without ever knowing the lyrics to most of the songs.  I'm one of those 'males' that probably would never admit to listening to Sarah unless I was actually asked, as I'm sure many others would too.  To put it simply, she rocks.  Sarah provids that voice that is sweet and sincere with a style that more keen to my own musical style.  I could never listen to Alanis (she's just too whiney) or Natalie (too trendy), as well as many of the other artists.  They all sounds like product and not for what music should be.  That's the problem with Afterglow, it's simply a product - it's not what made the other albums great.<br />Speaking of the music, all the instruments are laxed.  The complexity and emotion has been stripped out in favour of simpler, more repetitive choruses and melodies, which has been engineered on purpose no doubt to make the songs stick in the minds of the helpless public, looping within their unaware mental behaviourial processes.<br />The worst thing is, a lot of the songs are &quot;engineered&quot; to fill holes within the album, never really completing it - the whole is actually not greater than the sum of the parts.  Let's take Answer for example.  While I know some of the female audience will really like the song, it's an obvious replacement for &quot;Angel&quot;.  It's like her record producers said, &quot;We have to have a slow piano-like song on this album too - it made the last one sell so well&quot;.  Obviously, you can tell it's totally engineered and has no where near the same emotional context that came with Angel.  I generally just skip over it whenver I do give the CD a listen to.<br />Sarah, if you are reading this, try and capture that edge that you had back when developing Fumbling.  Try and relearn what you lost and focus on what made you become such a great individual artist before.  If you can do that, I'm sure you'll next album will be the best you've ever done.  But as it stands, this album is just so trendy and lacking that I can't even include it in the top 3 albums.  Sarah, you can do better.
B00009QG73|5.0|Sometimes you can go home again - and sometimes a reformed rock outfit with no new material to hawk can revisit the past and actually make it sound vital. Roxy's reunion tour was, with no apology, a celebration of their decade-long run, with all the hits (Dance Away, Love is the Drug) and album staples (Mother of Pearl, For Your Pleasure) trotted out for receptive audiences. This DVD not only captures the enthusiasm of Ferry, McKay, Manzanera &amp; Co. for their songbook, but it does so with some of the best audio/visual quality I've ever seen on a concert dvd. The camera work is great, capturing all the band members (this ain't just the Ferry Show) on the job. The band itself sounds thoroughly professional and spirited, and pulsing away at the core of it all is original Roxy drummer Paul Thompson. His presence is a real coup, not just for \\"legitimacy\\" reasons, but because his locked grooves both breathe on their own and propel the rest of the band forward with elan. Utility players Julia Thornton and Lucy Wilkins flesh out the various textures of everything from Avalon to Out of the Blue; Wilkins even tackles the primitive synths once employed by a certain Eno.<br />Some highlights: Manzanera's lacerating guitar solo over the menacing groove of While My Heart is Still Beating; the joyous crescendo of Mother of Pearl's second half; the one-by-one exits during the final section of For Your Pleasure. The extra documentary isn't shabby either. Absolutely essential for Roxy fans.
B000001Y5J|3.0|8 tracks in reality, 2 of which are instrumental and all in all nothing in relation to Pretty Hate Machine this is where the Reznorites really get to sink their teeth into the hatred. Useful EP but ultimately this is the beginning of the end really
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I think people can be so highly critical of her work. This album shows a blatant rise in artistic creativity. If you go back to &quot;Hit me baby one more time&quot; and listen to everything that has come since it is obvious that this young lady has grown as a woman and an artist. I obviously sound like a Britney fan and that is because I AM and this album was highly impressive to me. From her sultry sounds in &quot;Breathe on Me&quot; to her declaration of independence in &quot;I've Just Begun&quot; this album gives me more grounds to be a highly devoted Britney fan. She's comin out!!!! and lots of luck for those who are trying so desperately to ignore it.
B00005K3NY|4.0|By now you have all heard about the infamous exploding head scene. I actually never heard of this because all I was interested at the time was that it was a Cronenberg film and thought it would be worth a go. It was a great purchase!<br />The whole idea of the film is that there are scanners in this world who can read people's minds and if they don't like what they hear they kill them! I have a feeling some people would love that power. The scanners can be either &quot; self destructive or simply destructive.&quot; I'll admit the acting here at times can be wooden but I think there's a need for Cronenberg to have his characters perform wooden acting. It enhances the view that these socially inept scanners are all dehumanized humans who don't know how to survive in this world.<br />By the way I must mention the soundtrack here. This has got to be the most insane thing I've ever heard. It's as out there as you can possibly get. I don't know how they managed to get it the way it is but I really like it. I only wish they released it on CD because I'd love to listen to this more and more<br />The ending must be intentionally meant to confuse people. I've seen this about 10 times or so and I still don't know what they meant by &quot; It's alright - we've won! &quot; Who's won - I don't understand. Am I missing a scene from the film? That could be true since the censors where I lived in Ireland are notoriously picky about some scenes and would edit them out. Then again I don't know if there was an uncut edition in the first place! Even still I'd probably still be left confused by it all<br />Anyway as Cronenberg movies go this is an essential purchase! It's intelligently done and well worth seeing
B00000099Y|1.0|...a tuneless, self-pitying, white-noisy, and completely pointless piece of wankery.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|This is quite a collection!  Included you'll find all four Alien movies, from the original classic directed by Ridley Scott, to Alien Insurrection, each movie is a 2 DVD set special edition featuring both the original theatrical release of the film as well as either a directors cut or newly added scenes, as well as a ton of extra features, including interviews, documentaries, online exclusives, and original theatrical trailers.  the nith DVD is devoted entirely to special features, packing in so much new material, that I truly wonder if even the most devoted of Alien fans will be able to get through all the material included in this set.<br />There have been other Alien collections, but for the price, this is the definitive collection for any Alien or science fiction fan.
B00005B36H|1.0|This is not a record for the simple-minded.  It is an epic, an opera, a symphony.  It is so long and complex that it could challenge any symphony by Mozart.  In addition to such compositional skills,  Tool obviously know about space and math (&quot;Saturn ascends/Not one but ten&quot;), and that's kinda scary--only mathematicians are TRUE rock 'n rollers.  <br />Maynard is such a great singer--his range is amazing, especially when he unleashes that guttural, Madonna-on-acid scream at the end of Ticks and Leeches, a song that, by the way, contains at least 1,000 tom hits by Danny Carey!  Amazing!  Danny is obviously rock's finest drummer.  His super hard-hitting technique completely destroys such wimpy, unskilled drummers as Ringo Starr and Stewart Copeland; he is the real deal, a true rock drummer.  Adam Jones has, for the benefit of music fans everywhere, done what no one has had the gutso to do for over 30 years: take Jimmy Page's neo-classical bowed solo in &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; to its full fruition!  His fractured, airless air guitar pieces/solos are stunning showpieces worthy of such masters as Steve Lukather (Toto), the guy from Whitesnake, and any guitarist who has ever played with Oasis.  Only someone who riffs in 15/8 time and with lots of weird, wanky distortion is a true guitar virtuoso.  <br />Tool are kinda metal, but they have a feminine side too.  They like Indian stringy atmospheres (especially on &quot;Reflection&quot;) and mumbly, scientist-posing-as-a-rock-star vocals, both of which are the stuff of which heavy metal is truly made.  Only a band that could outdo a sludgy riff with a meandering soundscape is a real rock 'n roll band--I suggest that all those pretender bands out there (King Crimson, you know who you are) take note of such amazing musical ability!
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Loved the movie, love the soundtrack even more!  It's in perfect keeping with the film.  Great crescendo's and heroic melodies and lots of spooky, evil-cursed-pirates-are-coming-to-get-you music.
B00003CX9Q|4.0|I was glad when this movie was released on dvd. It is one of my favorites. But, have you seen the case for it? It was designed very badly. It should have come in a keep case (example of a keep case by movie - Ghostbusters 1 &amp; 2, UHF, When Harry Met Sally, etc.) There is a paper inserts with the cover pictrue on it under plastic. The plastic protects that from getting damaged. This case was made out of cardboard with nothing to protect it from wearing out. Otherwise, it is a great movie and a must own.
6304806426|2.0|First off, I must say, this movie does look tremendously pretty - very well done, excellent cinematography, and the like.<br />However, when I watch a movie, I think the story being told is much more important than the way it is told. The English Patient, in my humble opinion, is a boring story. The drama is overdone, the film drags on and on, and by the time I watched the first hour, I had put the pieces together and knew exactly how the film would end. The only redeeming aspect of the film, I felt, was the curious and cute relationship that developed between the nurse and &quot;Kip.&quot; <br />Honestly, I can't believe that this film garnered so much critical praise - I've read reviews that said the Pianist seemed to drag a bit. If the Pianist dragged, then the English Patient skids and thuds at a slower pace, tearing bits of the ground off as it nearly refuses to progress.<br />Eye candy it might be, but a waste of time the English Patient certainly is.
0385508417|3.0|I don't understand why people think that one must re-tell the story to express an opinion. If I had read some of these reviews before I purchased the book, I never would have purchased it. But I guess that's just me. I pick up a book and expect to read a story I don't already know.<br />I enjoyed the novel in the beginning, but as the story progressed, it not only became a bit absurd, it became transparent. The end was absolutely no surprise; I saw it coming very early on.<br />The characters are pretty flimsy and often cartoonish, which isn't a bad thing necessarily, but compounded with a predictable ending you get the formula for a silly romp. Not my cup of tea but I applaud Grisham's change of pace and the subject matter.
0151008116|2.0|I found \\"Life of Pi\\" immensely disappointing for several reasons...<br />The obvious reason for this book being such a letdown is because it definitely doesn't measure up to the hype and rave reviews. I fail to see why it even garnered so much attention! The author develops interesting twists on religion, zoology, survival... but the different themes presented are convoluted and do not quite fit together.<br />Another reason is the controversy surrounding this book. The Author, Yann Martel admits to having \\"borrowed\\" the concept for \\"Life of Pi\\" from \\"Max and the Cats\\" by Brazilian writer Moacyr Scliar. Mr. Martel admitted sponging the idea after the fact, which leads you to wonder why wasn't Mr. Scliar notified at any point and why no acknowledgement were made before the controversy was brought to light. Yann Martel's rebuttal to the accusation only gave me a negative feel about \\"Life of Pi\\" and it's origins. The author was quoted as saying the he had never read \\"Max and the Cats\\", that he had only seen a review by book critic John Updike (oddly enough, no trace of this review can be found) and explained why he hadn't read it as follows: \\"I didn't really want to read it. Why put up with the gall? Why put up with a brilliant premise ruined by a lesser writer?\\" This from an author who's previous dismal attempts ended in failures. <br />Lastly, \\"Life of Pi\\" disappointed me because it failed to deliver on its promise. Early in the book, Pi's uncle builds up the story by stating \\"it will make you believe in god\\". Suffice to say this was not achieved. I didn't really expect that this book would alter my belief system, but after a bold statement of that sort I expected at least some type of revelation, which there was no hint of. <br />Maybe I would have found this book more interesting if I hadn't heard anything about it beforehand, but then again, probably not!!!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I didn't like this disc at first.  Then I let go.  Instead of trying to hear what I wanted, I listened to what they were doing.  That made all the difference.  Comparing TOT with 6DOIT, AWAKE, SFAM OR IAW is fruitless and meaningless unless you keep in mind the fact that music is dynamic.  Your approach to writing a record is different everytime.  But, as a drum instructor once told me, a master doesn't always shine in complexity but he can blow you away with simplicity.  Sometimes not playing speaks more than playing.  The magic of this album is knowing that these guys can, if they wanted to, play some insanely complicated passages.  But they don't.  Instead of critiquing it based on their older work, try and figure out why they made an album like this; simpler, harder, darker.  That itself is just as much a part of the art of music as the actually virtuosity of the players.  This album kicks butt, sublimely.<br />One thing I very much enjoyed about this album was hearing their influences very distinctly.  There is Iron Maiden, Metallica, Yes, Pantera and a slew of world music influences on this disc.  But they aren't complicated riffs or majestic overwhelming passages.  It truly is just as much a masterpiece as all their previous recordings.
B0000A36J5|5.0|First off, I absolutely LOVE this movie (and all three movies for that matter).  My favorite parts of Two Towers are the Gollum scenes, the breath-taking and spectacular battle at Helm's Deep, and the Golden Hall scenes and an honorable mention to the overly dramatic scenes of Elrond.  <br />There are some extra scenes in this movie that are great and really help set up &quot;Return of the King&quot;.  There are some other parts that are good and add to the enjoyment of the movie.  There are a few others though that I could do without.  <br />By far the best scene was the &quot;Faramir, Boromir, and Denethor&quot; flashback.  It would have been helpful to have seen this before ROTK.  I also enjoyed all the new scenes toward the end of the film as they did much to enhance the story (especially the ents finishing the battle at Helm's Deep and Faramir's farewell to Frodo, Sam, and Gollum).  Even though Treebeard is one of my favorite characters, I found most of his added scenes to be unnecessary and hindered the flow of the story; although many fans of the books may enjoy those scenes as they make reference to several things in the books.  <br />So, the question is, is this worth buying?  Yes, I would say so.  The added scenes that are good are well-worth the money.  I do have to say the added scenes in &quot;Fellowship&quot; were better than the ones added here for &quot;Two Towers&quot;.  At any rate, it is an exceptional movie and most of the added scenes do make it easier to understand plot points in &quot;Return of the King&quot;.
B000059POY|5.0|Candy Christian is the blonde, blue eyed embodyment of Hollywood's image of female beauty. And, of course, everyone wants to score with her for all the wrong reasons. In the case of Ringo Starr as the Mexican gardener, it is for ethnic or economic revenge. In the case of the General, it is to breed the master race. And each of the others has his own axe to grind. It turns out that no one wants Candy for her individual qualities. They want her so they can make a statement, or because she is what Hollywood has instructed them that they should want.<br />The untimate irony of the movie is that she (and by implication anyone else) who conforms to the Hollywood image of female beauty and is seeking romance is doomed.<br />The genius of this movie is that such an edgy message - one that is easier to ignore than to recognize and bring up to the conscious level - is so well concealed in the medium of the very kind of mindless and plotless sex comedy which so frequently exploits the very same image.
B000092ZYX|5.0|its not a perfect radiohead album but its brillant still listening to it a lot after 6 months i love radioheads rock and mellow songs and aint big on electronic crap thats why its not perfect but when radiohead get it right they are untouchable
B000067IZ3|4.0|This very well-done film intertwines three separate stories depicting the impact of illegal drug business both on the people and the society as a whole. Michael Douglas stars as a newly-appointed US drug czar -- a presidential aide, who nevertheless loses the battle with drugs in its own family. Catherine Zeta-Jones is believably transformed from a pampered housewife of a drug mogul, who suddenly gets into custody pending a court trial, to a woman fighting on her own and for her kids. Oscar winner Benicio Del Toro shines as an uncorrupted Mexican near-border cop who loses any illusions about who's good and who's bad in this whole mess. &quot;Traffic&quot; works both as a thriller and documentary. It's fabulously acted, the screenplay is brisk and enthralling and the stamp of Academy-awarded director Steven Soderbergh makes sure that this is not a common Hollywood fodder. Of course, it would be naive to think that even a film like this will significantly elevate public awareness about the drug plague -- after all, it just barely hints at the huge scope this thriving traffic encompasses -- but at least it's something that makes the perceptive viewers think.
B000063DIR|5.0|Many of these reviewers are probably giving this cd a low rating just because of the rerecorded drums and bass.  But if you actually listen to it, it rocks.  Someone who hasn't heard the originals will find nothing wrong with it.  Ozzy and rhodes rock  And aren't those the people this is cd is primarily for?  Those critisizing the cd should all have the originals so what are they complaining about.  The cd's are for new fans who won't be able to tell a difference and will just think the cd is awesome.  Ya ozzy is just trying to pocket some more cash but can you blame him.  He deserves everything he's got.  I got used to the new sound after a little while and now i think it is just as good.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Sarah McLachlan is without a doubt the most talented singer and songwriter ever (my opinion of course ;) ). This album is no exception. It lives up to 'Surfacing' perfectly and was well worth the wait even though it was a long, painful wait. The lyrics are incredible, as always, especially for &quot;Fallen,&quot; &quot;Train Wreck,&quot; &quot;Answer,&quot; and &quot;Dirty Little Secret.&quot; I love all the songs on the CD, however.<br />I certainly hope she wins the Grammy she's been nominated for in February because she definitely deserves it.<br />The Goddess is back!
B00008977N|5.0|I agree the picture is a little grainy but the sound and the performance of Peter and his band make you forget about the imperfect picture. I don't know what other people are talking about with the lack of bass. They mustn't have the audio set right because the bass coming out my sub is phenominal. When the dome lands on the stage my whole house rumbles. I'm not even a big PG fan but this concert is one of the best I've seen second only to Pink Floyd's Pulse, which I am anxiously waiting for to arrive on dvd.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|If someone said 10 years ago that Marvel would be making an X-Men movie, I would be saying, how many people will actually go see it, but now, Marvel is churning out some of the best movies of the last ten years.  X-2 is the best of them all.  As for a movie, the plot was great, the story was kept moving, the dialogue was great especially anything that Magneto said.  The acting was good.  Unfortunately again, the Storm character was not given much depth.  Nightcrawler was dead on to the type of character he is in the comics.  His religious bend was done perfectly.  The only bad thing on a movie note is that the movie did set up a part 3, which was great for a comic book fan but those who never heard of the Phoenix has no idea what is going to come.  Any comic book reader should not only own this movie but have it as the center of comicbook movies.  For casual fans, this is a great movie hands down from the special effects to the back stories to Nightcrawler's attack scene.
B00006879E|5.0|I heard Maroon 5 a few years ago when they were still Kara's Folower's.  They were good, but still needed their music to mature.  When they changed their name and matured musically and lyrically I saw them perform at the gorge.  I love them.  They had such a wonderful stage presence and all of their songs are exceptional.  BUY SONGS ABOUT JANE!!! Some of my favorites on the CD are: This love (I'm sure you've already heard it), Sunday Morning, Sweetest Goodbye.  They also show their edgier guitar/rock side with songs like Must Get Out, and The Sun, which I love because they performed it as the sun was setting.  This CD is one of my favorites, everyone who I play it for instantly falls in love with the band.  Just try it, and if you love it you have to see them in concert, if not then resell it or give it as a gift.  What do you have to lose?
B0000DZEA1|4.0|Shore antes up another collection of majestic, victorious and emotionally-charged tales.  Such beautiful music that transports you back to the movie and away from the today's world.  This collection, however, seems to be missing that &quot;cherry on the top&quot;.  It's not a cohesive as its predecessors, Fellowship and Two Towers, although still beautiful.  <br />My favorites on this disc are: The White Tree, for its animated and uplifting feeling; Anduril, for its direct relationship to the Fellowship of the Rings recording and The Steward of Gondor featuring Billy Boyd.  Who could forget the &quot;Mist and Shadows&quot; song sung during the Steward's son ride to certain death to retake the garrison outside of Minas Tirith.  That will remain a powerful memory for me.  I also enjoyed The Return of the King with Viggo's cantoring.<br />Overall, a well written score to conclude the trilogy.  Eventhough I own all three soundtracks, I'll be waiting for the Special Edition, Deluxe Box Set that is coming...oh come on...you know it's coming!!  &lt;snicker&gt;
B0000029DD|3.0|I am sorry that Jeff Buckley's life was tragically cut short, as he obviously inspired many people with his music. However, I fear I am not one of those people; the stuff is simply too cloying. His celebrated renditions of &quot;Hallelujah&quot; and Benjamin Britten's Corpus Christi Carol are meant to be tastefully eerie, as we hear a gentle guitar and the haunted falsetto of the singer. It comes close, but something about it just rubs me wrong; it's all too close-miked, too fey, too unintentionally pompous. His voice reminds me of an elf. I do wish Jeff had lived on because he obviously had talent and potential, but I'm afraid what we have here is an album of wispy warbling that falls shy where it is meant to be profound. If the stuff really moves you, then go ahead and get it, but just because Jeff sounds rather different from other performers you may know - and I am glad he does - just because he sounds different doesn't necessarily mean he sounds great.
0385504209|5.0|This is an extraordinary book.  I could not put it down.  It is captivating from the very beginning.  Extremely well researched.  This answered a lot of my questions about the non-existant female presence in the Catholic Church.
B00005JLSE|3.0|A bunch of crooks hang around in dark prisons and clubs. A bunch of people dance around half naked, singing about the details of killing their husbands. The cynical manipulators walk away with the happy endings. &quot;Chicago,&quot; while beautifully photographed and featuring one or two catchy songs, is a dark, dank film version of a mediocre musical, featuring no appealing characters and not much genuine comedy either.
B0000DBJDM|4.0|I have seen the VHS version of this concert a couple of times in the past, and have always enjoyed it- I tell myself to be grateful that they have a live concert film from before Dark Side of the Moon. I have recently viewed the Director's Cut DVD and was delighted to find it had even more footage of the band &quot;behind the scenes&quot;. Not only did it show them in the recording studio working on Dark Side of the Moon, but it also showed black and white film shots of just them talking- I think it's fascinating to see them doing something besides music, even if it's eating oysters. The sound of this film is perfect, and although the shots taken of the band while playing were kind of outdated (I'm thinking of the 32 shots of Nick Mason playing drums at the same screen), getting to see them play was awesome. I especially like seeing Roger Waters bang on their gong violently during Saucerful of Secrets. The only reason I declined to give this DVD 5 stars is the graphics that the director has added, supposedly to add to the ambiance and mood of the overall film. The shots from space and the shuttle taking off were actually on the distracting side, and I did not feel it played to the mood at all. <BR>If you like Pink Floyd and the music they played before Dark Side of the Moon, you will definitely enjoy this- there are not too many opportunities for Floyd fans to see these guys actually play live- whether it be on a telivision screen or even on a CD. Enjoy!
0061015725|3.0|Definitely not his best work but kept me riveted for about 150 pages.  The last half of the book was a big disappointment.  I got the distinct sense I was rereading Sphere at times (although Sphere I thought was much better).  As the book winds down his plot twists become comical and where definitely written for his next movie project.
B00009TB5G|4.0|I was hard on the theatrical release.  It's not that I'm just some Tolkien purist.  I thought the changes Jackson made to Tolkien in LOTR were excellent, even inspired.  I thought the changes made in The Two Towers theatrical release treated the audience as if it was dumb and disrespected Tolkien's characters.<br />THIS DVD ADDS A LOT OF THE DEPTH TO BOTH CHARACTERS AND STORY THAT GOT LEFT ON THE EDITING FLOOR.<br />PROS<br />* The added scenes have given the Ents the depth of character and nobility that they had in the books; also, Pip and Merry no longer spend the whole movie riding around on Treebeard's shoulders<br />* MORE GOLLUM, MORE GOLLUM, MORE GOLLUM! Can you get enough of that guy?  Andy Serkis should get a best supporting actor!<br />* *Great* scenes at the end that summarize the three main story lines (Pip & Merry at Isengard, Aragorn and others at Helm's Deep, and Sam and Frodo leaving Osgilliath for Mordor)<br />* Added scenes of Saruman and Wormtongue that explain their decision to seige Helm's Deep<br />* *Wonderful* added dialogue between Eowyn and Aragorn where she figures out his kingly heritage--and that he's 87 years old but is of a blood-line that has long lives<br />* And this was the clincher for me: the added footage shows that Jackson really didn't change Faramir's character from Tolkien; we get to see a brilliant scene in which the conflict Faramir faced to steal the ring from Frodo because of his desire for his father, Denethor's, approval is explained; so, Faramir wasn't changed from a good guy to a bad guy; he was just conflicted<br />* MORE GREAT EXTRAS, INCLUDING A PIECE ON HOW ANDY SERKIS' MASTERFUL PORTRAYAL OF GOLLUM SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERED THE ENTIRE MOVIE FOR THE BETTER<br />CONS<br />* It is the weakest of the three movies and the one that I will view the least--but I will view it many, many times<br />* Gimli still comes off like a goof; I still think Jackson just should've cast some wiseacre comedian in the role if that is what he was going to do to Tolkien's noble warrior<br />* The Helm's Deep battle scene still drags on a little long, still has some cheesy dialogue (\\"And so it begins...\\"), and still has unbelievable plot developments (Oh, yeah, there's a secret door that lets Aragorn and Gimli out to fight the Orcs on the bridge!)<br />PURCHASING RECOMMENDATION<br />Run, don't walk, to buy this!  It is the weakest of the three movies, but it's still better than most directors' best movie by a long shot.was going to do to Tolkien's noble warrior<br />* The Helm's Deep battle scene still drags on a little long, still has some cheesy dialogue (\\"And so it begins...\\"), and still has unbelievable plot developments (Oh, yeah, there's a secret door that lets Aragorn and Gimli out to fight the Orcs on the bridge!)<br />PURCHASING RECOMMENDATION<BR>Run, don't walk, to buy this!

B00005BJ9W|4.0|Duran Duran's second album is as good as I expected. a happy sounding Rio, a nice Hungry Like A Wolf and a beautiful Save A Prayer were familiar songs for me before I bought this album. There are also several other good songs Lonely In Your Nightmare, Last Change On The Stairway and Hold Back The Rain. My Own Way and The Chauffeur are little bit booring but still good songs. All in all, This album sounds great and works well. Highly recommanded for new wave/syth pop listeners.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|In Germany nobody of my friends has ever heard of Firefly. Some weeks before christmas I found the DVDs in the amazon.com charts. What amazed me were all these 5 star comments. I got some hot coffee and began reading more than 130 comments about that show. <br />I could not understand how someone would put together space ships, horses, antique guns und a crew of nine people. But 130 comments about a not yet released DVD set could not be that wrong. So I bought the DVD set and began watching. <br />I love Babylon 5 and Farscape and I tought there won't be anything matching these two but Firefly certainly does. <br />There is the real kickin CGI of the ships, the stations and even of the landscape. I havn't seen something like this before. There is zooming, sharpening and shaking in the CGI parts. That gives you the feeling it is real. <br />But more important are the characters. Star Trek needs two seasons to get you familiar with the characters. Farscape and Babylon did this in one season, but Firefly kicks them all. It took me the pilot and the first four episodes to got to know the crew. Well, and to love them - especially Kaylee ;-) Each episode the tension between certain characters rises. Some characters you hate and like as well - like Jayne. Joss Whedon did a great job creating this set of different characters matching so fine. <br />The stories are also something new and special. Never thought about robbing a train with a spaceship. In almost every episode crime is done but somehow in a just way. I really like \\"Out of Gas\\" because of its movie-like cutting, fantastic sound and dark mood. And \\"War Stories\\" is also great. The torture is really hard and I don't think they would show it in Germany. But it makes it real. And at the end of \\"The Message\\" there is this over the top good bye scene with fantasic sound that wants to make you cry out loud. <br />But my most favorite episode is \\"Jaynestown\\". The biggest thing Firefly does can be best seen in Jaynestown.It entertains and it makes you LAUGH OUT LOUD. Really, image sitting in front of your TV at 11 pm and can't stop laughing. It just gets better and better. <br />All in all, this show is great and I hope the movie is coming soon. <br />You can't take the skies from me!
B000002V1D|3.0|I have to say that, I was totally disappointed when I heard this album first time. I was great expections because I had listened two classic tracks on this album Come Undone and Ordinary World which classics and Duran Duran's best songs ever. There are nothing else classics to find on the Wedding Album. Too Much Information and Femme Fatale are good songs. Shelter, Sin of the City and Breath After Breath are ok tracks. Rest of the songs are booring(Love Voodoo, UMF), torturing(Drowning Man,Shotgun), nasty( None of Above). I would give this album 2½ stars but I'm a little bit objective and don't give two stars. Three stars is a good for this because it's hard to undertand why some people like songs like a Love Voodoo. Maybe they like also exsotic music for exemple Bolivia and Albania. All in all, This album has its good and bad moments.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|just hearing about her is. So what if she kissed Madonna? I mean did anyone hear her voice, it sounded like if someone was holding her nose. It was like the sound of nails scratching the chalkboard. I mean her voice was awful.........Christina's voice was awesome. But anyways Britney album sucks. I mean these songs are so stupid that it seems like a 14yr old wrote them and on top of that an awful voice. Christina is a woman compared to this little girl. I think Britney should just quit singing and focus more on her next think to call attention for herself. I just don't understand why people keep buying this crap, maybe is airheads just like Britney. Christina's song fighter is better than any song that Britney has put out. I mean there is a lot of artist that I don't like but I still recognize that they have good songs, but her........the only thing she has is that she is a good dancer and performer
B00000099Y|5.0|Tool has done it, they have delivered one of the most powerful albums of our decade. Streaming farther then Nirvana, farther then Alice in Chains, Tool delivers a very powerful album filled with everything we love to hear. Maynard's vocals are superb, the kind that stick with you and keep repeating in your head. Adam Jone's guitar riveting, I can't help but only wish I could do what he can. Danny Carey and Justin Chancellor create such a powerful force of technicality, I can't help but be amazed. These are very fine musicians we are talking about. They work so well together to deliver some of the best pieces of music ever written. Please do yourself a favor and purchase Tool's second installment. Of course also buy Lateralus, for that is equally amazing.
B0000AGWJ7|4.0|I think this is an excellent metal cd.  All the songs are strong. The big problem I have with cd is the poor sound quality. This is the reason I did not give it 5 stars.  I hope for there next cd they can improve on their sound.  It's too bad they are are not on Century or Roadrunner because I am sure that the sound quality would be much better.  I still highly recommend this cd.  I would put in the class of my favorite metal band Children of Bodom.
B00005JMTN|3.0|Big Fish is simple, yet complicated. Intriguing, yet boring. Mystical, yet real. I consider myself an intelligent person and an avid movie watcher, but found myself lost in this film from the very beginning. <br />While Tim Burton is an unforgettable director and Finney, McGregor, and the other actors are crisp, emotional actors, the film as a whole does not completely hold together. It seems as if the bricks are in position, but the cement between them has not yet been applied. The glue holding the film together, a theme, an idea that is universal, is there, but is still only sitting on the ground and not being used to its full potential.  <br />So let's just say this: if you are looking for something with deep meaning and complex emotion, this film attempts to appeal to you, but doesn't quite make it. However, if you just want something fun, mystifying, and visually spectactular, Big Fish is it.
B00005JLZN|5.0|Had I read the reviews here, I would NEVER have picked up this movie. I am SO very glad I didn't check the reviews first! Yes, the possibility of this story actually happening in &quot;real&quot; life is somewhat slim however, the concept and the ultimate point made was dead on (no pun intended). Can an innocent man be executed? You bet. Can an extremist go to these lengths to prove it? Probably. The movie made the point in a compelling and interesting way without &quot;preaching&quot;. I would definitely recommend it, and already have.
0060194995|5.0|I was first &quot;forced&quot; to read &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; in high school. Thank God for whatever teacher it was who made us read it. I am currently a practicing lawyer, and I have to admit that I was influenced in part to become an attorney by none other than Atticus Finch.<br />The book is such a fantastic examination of people's prejudices, fears, and hatreds, no doubt far more scholarly people than myself have examined it and analyzed it to pieces. But it does expose so many raw nerves for so many people: the pettiness of bigotry by whites against blacks during the depression, the fear of the unknown in the person of Boo Radley, the sheer injustice of the all-white jury convicting Tom Robinson...and through it all, we are treated to the quiet dignity of Atticus Finch.<br />The story is essentially told through the eyes of Scout, an intelligent but often guileless young girl who is frankly confused by the prejudice that rears its ugly head when Tom Robinson, a black man, is accused of raping Mayella Ewell, a white woman, the daughter of a violent drunk white farmer.<br />Scout's love for her father is apparent throughout the book, particularly when she watches him remain quietly courageous in the face of ever growing town anger at the prospect of Atticus defending Robinson. But there is not necessarily a happy ending here. The story is bittersweet, Atticus does not save the day for Robinson, but Scout is rescued from potential harm from an unexpected corner and learns that one should never judge anyone by appearances alone.<br />A true, timeless classic which I have re-read several times over the years. Anyone who is not moved by this book is quite plainly an idiot.
B00000G3PA|1.0|Terrific special effects cannot possibly hope to buoy this dung heap of a movie.  Unlike the similarly-plotted &quot;Deep Impact&quot;, &quot;Armageddon&quot; is a shallow, explosives-laden snoozer, featuring too many stars speaking too much cheesey dialogue through too many painfully-scored and acted scenes.  I'm not sure what I disliked more, the music video pacing or the ludicrously rubber &quot;science&quot; behind this piece of science fiction.  Really, don't bother with this one, unless you plan to turn the sound off and enjoy the movie purely on its visual merits.  In that department it is a home run.  Otherwise, skip it, and go get a copy of &quot;Deep Impact&quot;.  Now there is a truly outstanding asteroid disaster movie.

0805211063|4.0|Outside of the Russian authors it's hard for me to think of an author I like more than Kafka. I own everything he's every written, whether I have read all of his stories is a different matter lol. I have read \\"The Trial\\", and have read some of his short stories. I even did a school paper on two of them, \\"The Vulture\\" and \\"Home-Coming\\". But, \\"The Castle\\" is somewhat disappointing.<br /> When I first read \\"The Trial\\" I had a lot of ideas as to what it represented. I felt a connection with the main character, but, here with \\"The Castle\\", I'm debating what is this book about? My first guess was\is the castle clearly represents the government. But I wouldn't call \\"The Castle\\" a political book. As with all of Kafka's novels, they are incomplete. I noticed this bothered some people when reading \\"The Trial\\", but I thought the book was a masterpiece. I've also noticed some people are bothered by this book being incomplete as well. While I'm not really upset over that, I will admit, I did think about it more. Many characters are just forgotten. We have no clue what will happen to them. The last chapter I found unnecessary. And hated the last sentence in the book.<br /> But would I call this a bad book? No. Maybe I just like Kafka so much I can't be hard on him. I do think there is some substance to this book, it just takes a while to absorb it, but, I don't think it's as rewarding as \\"The Trial\\".<br /> Would I encourage someone to read this book? Only if your a Kafka fan. In order to \\"test the waters\\" read some of the short stories and \\"The Trial\\", I haven't read \\"Amerika\\" yet, so I can't comment on it, but \\"The Castle\\" should not be your introduction into Kafka's world.<br /> Bottom-line: For me, simply not as thought provoking as other works by Kafka. I enjoyed it to a point, but was left somewhat disappointed. Has a sloppy ending and seems as if it doesn't resolve anything.

B000050XEI|4.0|I've grown up listening to Enya. When I was but a wee thing, strapped in the carseat of my dad's van, he'd pop in her older album &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot;, and my infant brain heard, processed, and retained.<br />Fourteen years later her music has grown to be a part of me, and this album really keeps it going.<br />I agree with the fact that it is far too short--I want more! But really, there isn't a single track I don't enjoy. Quality over quantity, I suppose, though more of a good thing could actually be better here.<br />As for highlights, my favorites include &quot;Wild Child&quot;, &quot;Flora's Secret&quot;, &quot;Silver Inches&quot;, and &quot;One by One&quot;.<br />&quot;Wild Child&quot; is nostalgia for me, almost symbolic to my growing up with Enya's music. Playful and innocent, like the mind of a child, running and playing without a care in the world.<br />Being a helpless romantic, &quot;Flora's Secret&quot; is upbeat and happy--describing the amazing, indescribable feeling of love. Simply beautiful.<br />&quot;Silver Inches&quot; is a short, dreamlike instrumental, with synthed strings, I believe. It never ceases to give me a vivid image of flying on the back of some mythical beast over a beautiful green land (so I have strange fantasies). <br />Finally, my favorite of the album--&quot;One by One&quot;. I listened to this song for about three hours straight, on repeat, as I read the Seventh Tower series (shameless plug: check that out, too). A rather sad yet hopeful song about the end of a romantic relationship, yet love still goes on in different forms. <br />All in all, a wonderful album worth buying for any Enya fan. *heart heart heart*
B000044U4B|5.0|this is the greastest metallica and thrash metal album ever
B000002NHN|5.0|There are not words to describe the beauty of Loreena McKennitt's voice, nor the lyrics to her songs--all are simply profound, beautiful, and left me with tears in my eyes on more than one occasion.<br />I can't say I've got an average 14-year-old's taste in music, for my likings run in that of Enya and and more &quot;soulful&quot; music, for lack of a better word.<br />Thus, this album clearly suited my love for those shivers that go up your spine when you listen to something with such meaning, power, and amazing beauty. <br />My favorite tracks would have to be &quot;The Mummer's Dance&quot;, naturally, because it is also what prompted me and many others to buy the album in the first place. Fun and catchy with beautiful music, I never get tired of this song. <br />&quot;Santiago&quot; satisfies my uncontrollable desire to hear the beyond gorgeous sounds of Arabic music. Similar sounding to &quot;Santiago&quot; and the Arabic-sounding tracks of &quot;The Mask and the Mirror&quot;, this song makes me feel like running through the desert sands of Egypt... a strange personal fantasy of mine. =D<br />And then there is the notorious &quot;The Highwayman&quot;, which left me breathless, in tears, and nearly trembling. I can't describe this poem-based song in words. For one, it is written to an old poem, which in itself is amazing--but put to music, the result is stunning. Beautiful vocals, haunting tune, powerful music, period. All I can say is &quot;Wow&quot; with a giant capital W.<br />Actually, that's really all I can say for the entire album. <br />Wow.
B000099T2L|1.0|Look I was never a fan so I didn't buy this cd, never will. I WILL NOT LOSE money, ha ha. And, her solo effort did nothing for me besides being forced to listen to the songs constantly played on the radio/tv - and her popping up everytime I looked at an event - 'with all that in a nut-shell' I ask myself - Who is Beyonce? - Does she have a twin with stripper tendencies?  How come Ashanti/Monica R very pretty, dress sexy but don't look hoochified? Why do we have to see her half naked most of the time?  <br />In Crazy in Love she looks like a video ho(who heard JayZ say 'me and my beautiful \\"bee-tch\\" is in the back of that 'bach'), more than the lead singer when she's fussing up to Jay Z - didn't we see those moves in 50 Cent's PIMP video? 'Thank God 4 granting me this moment of clarity'.  I don't think she can hold her own(as opposed to Ashanti) - first two songs are collab's with the God's - Jay and Sean P., huh!  <br />Beyonce should become a stripper - she may go platinum faster, LoL.  Jay Z if you really wanna 'change clothes and go' - find a classy woman, not 1 who's shaking her half-naked butt leaving nothing to ur business associates imagination. Peace...

B0000DJZ9T|5.0|I got this DVD expecting it to be some poorly shot concert with poor surround sound and limited features. It was cheap so I bought it anyway. I turned it on and instantly found I was completely wrong. The visuals were the first things i noticed. Instead of predictable sweeping cameras and profile shots, the cinematics were very original and captivating. The cinematography matched the intensity and setting of the band: When the opening number started, the music pounded and the visuals become so jumpy I just got lost and faded into the music. The audio is in DTS 5.1 and is equaly as good as the visuals. It doesnt sound like your at the concert; it sounds better. The music covers you, but unlike other 5.1 music dvds, the sound is stationary - none of the sounds jump around. This creates a more consistant sound, and is excellent to just sit down, relax and completely fade right into the music.
0393317552|2.0|While I urged myself on to finish the book, Diamond lost much of his credibility in his prologue.  After making impassioned statements against &quot;racist&quot; assertions of ethincally based differential intelligence, he goes and says New Guineans are more intelligent than wetern Europeans.  I am a south-west Asian ethincally so my reaction to that was not a defensive one.  He fell headlong into the trap of guilt-driven Western reverse-prejudice. I can't beleive non of his editors insisted he take that piece out.

B00005M91K|3.0|The very high rating given this DVD sold me on it. I wish I had not bought it. It is over-rated, I think.<br />The film needs editing down to 1:20 or less. It had beauty and striking composition and often effective music/video coordination and then ... strangely, is unecessarily repetitive. The star-transit scenes especially just don't work. I mean, how many times do we need to see the great arch at Arches National Monument? It was featured maybe 10 times! Or it seemed so.<br />The film was a good idea, not realized. And a good many scenes are repeated twice, three times, even. Once was plenty.<br />I might feel I'd gotten my money's worth if I'd rented this DVD. Maybe. It's a close call. I am disappointed to have bought it. It is not finished! It is obviously giving us many strong messages but not, I fear, terribly effectively.
B0000CABBW|4.0|This is a beautiful movie, and it has the kind of balance one finds in well written literature. Whale Rider could of easily fell into a politically correct trap -- with the Maori tribal traditions as partrichal as the Catholic Church, and, when frozen in the past, as close-minded.  But the movie's approach is understated.  It is also gentle and wise, suggesting that tradition does have a great deal to teach, but it is best understood when past, present, and future are equally considered when searching for wisdom. In other words, by maintaining a healthy tension between the three, only then can we hear the quiet voice that seeks to guide us, whether it be through whales, the Ancients, or God. <br />There is a point in the movie when I felt a powerful, but tragic, ending could of been chosen. (You will know it when you see it.) And what follows that moment is to some extent a feel good ending (leaving me with a few questions as to How?). But that, in this case, is nitpicking. Whale Rider is truly about heart -- and hope, and not about cold art. Whale Rider is one of those rare movies that can teach lessons, and in the best way, with gentle nudges.
B00006LSM3|4.0|I used to have Cloud 9, but it was so Jeff-Lynned I had to get rid of it.  I know they were friends and Jeff's a good guy, but his footprints ended up all over Tom Petty's and Roy Oribson's albums and I was getting tired of hearing eerily similar songs (with that 1-and-*2*-and-3-and-*4* drumming)that were just sung by different people.     George Harrison was one of those artists who, when he was on his game, he was on in a stellar way.  Only a few of his solo albums exemplify what I'm talking about (33& 1/3, George Harrison and All Things Must Pass are my faves.).     This is a good album, and I'm glad Jeff's treatment is more subdued.  I'm from the camp that believe George was one of the true greats. However, I also realize that, as much as I would have liked to have seen more music from him during his lifetime, he just had other priorities in his life and lived for those.  Sometimes, that can be more inspirational than what he put on the music store shelves.  He gave us this album as a goodbye present.    I was pretty jazzed to hear his version of \\"Run So Far\\" after only hearing Clapton's version for 12 years.  Songs like \\"Never Get Over You\\" and \\"Rocking Chair in Hawaii\\" contain echoes of the 76-80 stuff he did.  \\"Any Road\\" and \\"Brainwashed\\" are more like his recent stuff.  \\"Devil And The Deep Blue Sea\\" gives us a peek into his apparent love of the ukelele.  Over all, it's a fairly well-rounded album.
0345440900|3.0|As a first-time mom of a very fussy, high-need baby, I was desperate to find some answers as to how to help my baby calm down and sleep better/longer. I read everything from &quot;The Baby Book&quot; and &quot;The Fussy Baby Book&quot; (Sears) to &quot;Babywise&quot; to &quot;Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child&quot; to &quot;The No-Cry Sleep Solution&quot; to &quot;The Happiest Baby on the Block&quot; and everything in between (this book falls in the &quot;in-between&quot; category). It's well-written and even entertaining, and some of her insights are helpful in terms of attempting to &quot;read&quot; baby's varying cries. However, I tried her techniques over and over and over with my baby with NO success. I could pick her up and put her down over 100 times, and she would still keep fussing! She never did stop crying, even when I picked her up, as the author promises the baby will. Her techniques seem a bit idealistic to me, but by all means give it a try. Her techniques would probably work beautifully with what she calls &quot;Angel&quot; or &quot;Textbook&quot; babies, but if you have a special &quot;Spirited&quot; tyke, like I do, read &quot;The Fussy Baby Book&quot; instead. You'll find more realistic approaches there, and it will help you understand your high-need child and her unique needs.
B00006L3S3|4.0|And this is still my favourite of every thing I've heard that he or his estate has put out.  Walls and Bridges is still the only album of his that I haven't had a chance to hear yet, so maybe my opinion will change one day. :)<br />Until then, I like the overall texture of this album.  From the softer songs like One Day At A Time (I had Elton's version first on 45) and Aisumasen to the harder-edged songs like Meat City and Freeda People, there's a great balance of tempo and emotion.  A great look into where Lennon appeared to be in his life at the time.
0140157352|5.0|This is a basic book on how to resolve things as peacefully as possible. It is not the sort of advanced text you'd expect if you are studying to become a professional mediator, but is rather aimed at people who could benefit from an introduction to (or review of) basic negotiation skills.  <br />Some of these things are the sort of common sense people frequently think of (alas!) in hindsight - for instance,  it talks about your 'best alternative to a negotiated solution'(before you demand that raise, ask yourself: how hard would it be for me to find a new job? Then: how hard would it be for my boss to replace me?) and how to set expectations against an objective standard - your position is much stronger if you are arguing based on the 'going rate', the usual practice, or some other outside measurement that an unbiased observer might consider a fair and reasonable expectation.  <br />If you are divorcing, have a conflict with your landlord or neighbor, or want to get a better deal from your public schools with regards to your highly gifted or learning disabled child, it would definately pay off to read this book.
B00005JM0B|4.0|I was really worried about this movie. I didn't think they could ever make another Terminator movie, seeing as how the story basically ended with T2. And the fact the James Cameron, who basically envisioned, wrote, &amp; directed the first two, wasn't going to have anything to do with this movie made me nervous. The Terminator movies have been two of my favorites for years. So, my expectations for this flick were huge.<br />The story goes that the Judgement Day that was prevented in T2 was actually only delayed. It's very hard to explain and if I did, it might ruin some of the plot in the movie. But, know that for a story that James Cameron didn't write, it's still very good. Basically a new terminator, played by a Uber-HOT Kristanna Loken, comes back through time to kill John Connor. And once again, Arnold plays the good terminator and is sent back to protect John (played by Nick Stahl) from the new TX. This new terminator is even more of a bad-ass the the one from T2. It is a robot terminator, like Arnold, except newer and mucn stronger and has a liquid metal exterior. As you can probably expect, things get blown up, there is much gunfire and great special effects insue. <br />A subplot in the movie involves the TX taking out, what are going to be, John Conner's revolution buddies now before they become older. One of the people, is a girl that John knew in junior high. She is played by Claire Daines and becomes a main character in the movie. I won't say how, because that would give away a plotline, but it's pretty interesting. For most of the movie, the TX is chasing down Arnold, John Conner, and Katherine Brewer (the Claire Daines character). <br />The action scenes are very well done. The special effects have come a LONG way since T2. When you see the chase scene with the crane (you will know what I mean when you see it), your jaw will drop to the floor. The TX itself looks very nice. Kristanna Loken is unbelievably hot, but she plays the role very well. Her movements and expressions are very robotic. I am certainly hoping to see her in more films in the future. I am glad they didn't get Edward Furlong to reprise his role for this, because Nick Stahl is a much better &amp; less irritating actor. Claire Daines seems out of place in an action movie like this, at first. But, after awhile she blends right in. And what can you say about Arnold playing the Terminator that hasn't been said already? It's his role and he does perfectly.<br />Jonathan Mostow does a good job directing this movie. He didn't go away from the look or the story of the previous films, but he definately made his own movie. Overall I liked this film quite a bit. While I can't devulge why I liked the plot without giving some key things away, I think fans of the other two movies will definately like this movie and will leave satisfied. It's not as original as the other two, but as a summer action/sci-fi movie, it definately is worth the money you would toss down on it.<br />The DVD is a 2-disc set with lots of special features, but not all of them that interesting. You get a commentary with the director and all of the main cast. There is one deleted scene and it's hilarious. I can see why it wasn't left in the movie, but it'll give you a big laugh when you see it. There is the dreaded 12 minute HBO promotional featurette that I hate to see on these discs. There a a bunch of little documentaries on the special effects, as usual. There is a somewhat funny blooper reel. And some other little features that are decent. Overall, I found the supplements to be somewhat disappointing and I hope there is not some 3-disc set on the way that I don't know about.

However, the book organizes the concepts well, systematically and, perhaps more importantly, in a consistent style (not to mention that is also well indexed).<br />For the beginner Lua programmers it offers handholding, for the programmers with extensive C background it shows how to replace conventional C idioms with more efficient Lua ones and, finally, for the hardcore Lua people it offers those glimpses of Lua code honed to perfection.<br />At fewer than 300 pages the book manages to cover the entire language while emphasizing on doing things the Lua way.

B00006CXXU|5.0|This is what is called real music! I'm 16 and would much prefer to hear this than any rap album! Her vocals are incredible. She has a true singing voice that cannot compare to any &quot;R&amp;B&quot; singer Een if Christina doesn't sell more records than her other fellow singers, she will always be the best (compared with Aaliyah, the true R&amp;B singer). Christina fills the entire cd with 16 songs and 4 interludes. The interludes aren't uncessary bull$h*t, like an artist talking for no reason to fill the minutes in the cd. Coming in at 77:50, $17.99 is the right price. Every song is unique and original. I don't believe there are any covers on here, but I could be wrong. Who cares if there is a cover of a song, Christina makes it sound like her own. Anyway, her ballads stand out on here more than her up-tempo songs like Dirrty, the up-tempo songs are great but the ballads have more feeling and a clear message. I like the fact that she doesn't put all of her slow songs at the end of the cd, they are spread out throughout the cd. I will now highlight my favorite songs:<br />1) Walk Away - My favorite song. I hope this will be her next single. The most beautiful ballad she has. It has an R&amp;B vibe with great background vocals. 5/5 [5:47]<br />2) Fighter - Empowerment song that has a guitar lead in the music. Love the video. 5/5 [4:05]<br />3) Loving Me 4 Me - Another beautiful ballad. A man should love of woman for her inner beauty not for her outside appearance. 5/5 [4:36]<br />4) Beautiful - Beautiful! Another great video (kinda disturbing) but great video. 5/5 [3:58]<br />5) The Voice Within - My second favorite song. Christina really knows how to pick good songs to release. On the cd, there is an extended ending that makes me feel sad sometimes. 5/5 [5:03]<br />6) Singing My Song - A great ending to a perfect and flawless cd. No one can bring you down. 5/5 [6:29]<br />Don't delay to buy this cd. It is worth the money. Don't let Dirrty turn you away, that is theonly song that sounds like that on the cd. She did this to prove that she can do it, but doesn't stress on it. Very smart. L8r!!!<br />My top 5:<BR>1) Walk Away<BR>2) The Voice Within<BR>3) Singing My Song<BR>4) Beautiful<BR>5) Loving Me 4 Me
B00005JMFO|5.0|This is a heart movie of the best (and least cheesy) kind. In spite of, and in fact because of, one story which might catch some viewers off guard with its physical parody (because there is no warning), all of these stories are of true life and love. My husband and I have seen it twice and will buy it on DVD when it comes out, which can't be too soon. These are the kinds of lessons you want your teenagers to know about, the kind you want to share with everyone you know.
B00005JMGL|4.0|I think I remember seeing the original 1953 Disney animation movie PETER PAN as a child, and am fairly certain I saw the Mary Martin TV version of 1956. Memory is failing. But I can safely say that neither was as entrancing as this 2003 film production.<br />The fantastical plot surrounds the boy, Peter Pan (Jeremy Sumpter), who never grows old but can fly. (What child doesn't long for that latter talent?) Early on, he captivates the almost-pubescent Wendy Darling (Rachel Hurd-Wood) and her two younger brothers, John (Harry Newell) and Michael (Freddie Popplewell), and he transports them from their Victorian London home to make-believe Neverland, where they must confront and battle the one-armed Captain Hook (Jason Isaacs) and his band of pirates. And don't confuse Neverland with Michael Jackson's ranch of the same name.<br />The residual child within me champions a four-star award for this production, though the curmudgeon side of me screams for only two; this is not riveting entertainment for adults, and I admit to having to stave off mid-show drowsiness. But youngsters should be delighted. That distinction made, however, grown-ups will perhaps be at least gratified by the special effects, which, though not as eye-popping par as those in this year's THE LORD OF THE RINGS: RETURN OF THE KING, are dazzling. To my mind, the best are of Hook's ship flying through the cloud-strewn sky, and the miniature fairy, the mischievous Tinker Bell (Ludivine Sagnier), who weaves a scintillating path through many scenes.<br />There are some fine performances here. The young unknown, Rachel Hurd-Wood, is enchanting, and I hope to see her in more mature roles as she gets older. Even better is Jason Isaacs, who plays both the irrepressible Hook and Wendy's shy father, Mr. Darling - a fact you'd never expect until the ending credits roll.<br />As I sat watching PETER PAN, I pondered what age group the film's creators were hoping to reach. As I've implied earlier, adults may be put to sleep by the plot. I finally decided that 6 to 13 is the approximate target, though there's a definite hint of a nascent and smoldering sexuality between the budding Wendy and her hero Peter that'll go over the heads of the youngest in this group. Let's just call it puppy love, and leave it at that.<br />PETER PAN is an attractive diversion for the young or young at heart.sleep by the plot.

B00000K31V|5.0|Although eXistenZ came out around the same time as The Matrix, it seems to be a response to that film. Where The Matrix gave you a digital divide between reality and virtual reality, eXistenZ takes place in the gray area between.<br />But it's not a PK Dick rehash. Cronenberg spends as much time on the characters and their motives as he does on pseudo-intellectual questions of reality. (The film is also a humorous spoof of computer-game devotees.) Although there are a lot of scenes that lay flat --- instead of moving the plot forward --- the actors are so good, everything is easy to watch. Willem Dafoe is charming and scary as Gas, and Jude Law plays a pitch-perfect resourceful sidekick to Jennifer Jason Leigh. (You also have to hand it to Cronenberg for making the central character female without making her a damsel in distress or an masculine action heroine.)<br />This is a low-key but excellent movie. It's the kind of film you can enjoy over and over, picking up new bits of detail every time. It's not for everyone, of course. Cronenberg can repel some viewers with gooey special effects and psychological drama. But I think it's one of his best films, and certainly one of the best in 1999.
B000001FS3|5.0|Before I picked up this album I knew the standard U2 radio hits, including the first three on this one, so I was a \\"fan\\" of what I had heard, but nothing prepared me for \\"The Joshua Tree\\". Every single song on it is great. Even some of my other all-time favs like \\"Exile on Main Street\\" and \\"The White Album\\" have a couple songs that are not as good as the others, but with this one you're given pure beauty. It's got the perfect opening track, \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\". I think the great part about this song is how each member of the group comes in to it separately. \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" is probably Bono's most well-written, best-sung song. \\"With or Without You\\" is obviously one of the best love songs ever written. Edge's guitar really hit me hard on this one. \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\" really showcased the rhythmic qualities of Larry and Adam. This is one of their real rockers. The fifth track is my favorite on the album, \\"Running to Stand Still\\". Bono's vocals are very calm and beautiful and Edge plays some nice slide guitar; the lyrics are terrific.  \\"Red Hill Mining Town\\" and \\"In God's Country\\" are terrific \\"in between songs\\". The eighth track, \\"Trip Through Your Wires\\" is U2's most fun and joyous song; Bono does some great harmonica work on this one. \\"One Tree Hill\\" really does a great job preparing you for the end of the album; the backing vocals are incredible. \\"Exit\\" struck me as more of a darker song, but it nevertheless got its point across. Finally, you get \\"Mothers of the Disappeared\\", which just proves that U2 has created a masterpiece.<br />Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno do a bang up job with the production. They seemed to really know how to get the best out of the band. Even though I didn't own this album before my senior camping trip, before I graduated from high school, I listen to \\"The Joshua Tree\\" now and I can easily remember how much fun I had with my friends before we all left each other. Bottom Line: Do yourself a favor andget this album.
B0000BWVCM|3.0|The first X-Men movie had excellent casting but not much of a plot. This sequel is more of the same. Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, and Ian McKellen were born for their roles in this film. If you read the Byrne/Claremont comic book from the early 1980s, you had to be pleased with the performances of these three actors. The other roles are not as impressive. Halle Berry is too young for Storm and the actor who plays Cyclops has too little charisma. Cyclops was supposed to be the understated leader of the team, the stand-in for Professor X when the heroes were away from the school, but in this movie he just pouts and says &quot;I love you&quot; to Jean Grey a few times.<br />The plot has some major problems. The heroes spend too much time running for cover and trying to figure out what's going on. When they finally got to fight, I was bored. The whole movie seems to take place in about four locations, giving it a claustrophobic feel. Wolverine's claws look good and the movie version of Nightcrawler is okay, but the majority of the superpower special effects have an off-the-shelf feel to them. Cyclops' laser-beam eyes are just a very bright red light, really. Nightcrawler's blue cloud that follows his teleportation looks thin and fake, as well. Very little creativity went into these effects.<br />The best thing about this movie is the decision to keep two essential parts of the Byrne/Claremont comic book --- the internal drama between the characters (the comic had a soap opera feel to it) and the prejudice angle (mutants are a persecuted and feared minority). These two ideas are alive and well in this film, which makes it more than your typical effects-heavy superhero flick.

6304806418|3.0|Alan Paker's Evita is a big Hollywood musical based on an even bigger Broadway stage hit. It took twenty years and multiple changes of  directors and stars to get to this point. The question that remains is was it all worth it. From my point of view the answer is a definite maybe.<br />Evita tells the watered down story of Eva Peron a woman who wanted it all and seemingly got it all by the time of her death at age 33. Madonna pulls off the role with ease. She blends herself into the role with abandon. It does not matter that she no longer looks like the 15 year old Eva Duarte she is supposed to be playing at the beginning of the film. Her vocals sweep and soar and we actually have a great time watching the Material Girl try to pull off the part of a lifetime.<br />The Greek chorus of the film is the character Che played by Antonio Banderas. Banderas is one of the surprises of the film. His singing is more than adequate and just under the surface there is the cynicism that is necessary to make the part work. The character of Eva had to be watered down for the movie to be shot on location and if you watch just closely enough Banderas brings some of Eva's questionable character back.<br />Alan Parker acquits himself well as director. The film moves along swiftly and looks great. Watch the crowd scenes during Peron's rise to power and the stirring cinematography that accompanies &quot;A New Argentina&quot; to see what I mean. If there is a problem here it is that at some points the film looks rather like a long form music video than an actaul feature film.<br />My only real problem with this disc is that there are no extras at all. Not even the theatrical trailer is presented. Hollywood pictures did a fine job with the transfer but give the buyer a little more for his money.<br />Watch this one with the sound up it is well worth your time.
0767830555|3.0|I heard a lot about the movie Taxi Driver, for a while.  So I thought it would be good, because Martin Scorscece directed it.  But I was wrong.  The movie is just about him driving people around and hes stocking this girl by watching her constantly.  And then at the end he exercises and kills 4 guys.  Thats it.  I thought it was going to be like The Goodfellas or Casino.  Since it was made in the 70's, I will give it credit.  It is just a renter.
B00006RCNJ|4.0|The most musically interesting of the Rieu concerts -- and the most painful to watch. <br />The DVD director (or the post-production team -- it's impossible to tell who's-doing-what-when anymore) have endowed it with a frantic, constant-motion, MTV music-video edit, reminding you every two seconds that someone somewhere is pushing buttons! New angle.  New angle.  New angle. Ad nauseum...<br />Thank goodness for the music: everything from Hava Nagila to Glenn Miller and the &quot;Andre&quot; Sisters (as noted by another reviewer, the track list given here is totally wrong) and it's all wonderful! Even the repeat stuff like the Strauss &amp; Co. medley and the Shostakovitch Second Waltz.<br />Interestly, the one visual element that could have been -- and would only be possible in this particular venue -- is missing. The ground floor of Royal Albert Hall does not have permanent seats. Where we would have &quot;Orchestra&quot; tickets, or the British buy &quot;Stalls&quot; seats, there's nothing -- just a flat floor.  It's done that way to provide a large but well-located &quot;standing room&quot; section for the famous summer Proms Concerts.  Wow! Instead of the portable seats that were brought in for this occasion, wouldn't it have been fantastic to see the WHOLE ground floor dancing round and round to this wonderful music.  Oh, well...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Where did this come from?  I never even heard of this before the end of 2003. (Fox and their stellar advertising again?) It sounded fun so I thought, why not?  All I can say is Simply Unbelievable!!  Easily, one of the best Sci-Fi series.  Great characters, stories and effects. It seems as though each episode gets even more interesting. There is so much going on under the surface of the characters it keeps you absolutely riveted. I found myself hanging on their every word and nuance. It just doesn't get any better.  At the risk of being repetitive with the other reviews,  What was Fox thinking when they cancelled this?  Sounds like it's time for some management changes...
B00005JMCN|5.0|MUST SEE, THAT IS ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY. Great Moive. Classic
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh once again has provided a great listening experience!  Each word is enunciated so that it can be understood--the Italian is flawless (I speak Italian.)  Even the nuances of the language are met with great aplomb.  &quot;Caruso&quot; is a breathtaking song, as is &quot;Oceano&quot;.  His high notes are unstrained and easy to listen to, and his emotion is so beautifully expressed. It was lovely to hear the French as well as Spanish sung to perfection. Bravo on a 2nd album that is as wonderful as the first!  I have purchased 10 for gifts!
B0000VAFNQ|5.0|More or less of what others think I would like to say that this movie kept me glued to the screen as I saw in in theateres.  It is the most grusome provactivie and intesifying film I have ever seen.  I enjoyed this movie it's a keeper!
B0000VAFO0|5.0|Just watched this movie last night. It is definitely a cross between Blade and the Matrix.  Great costumes, cinematography, action and special effects were wonderful. It was a good idea to have vampires and werewolves going at it. The casting was also good, but would have preferred Bruce Payne playing the part of Victor.  The ending leaves it open for a sequel and I certainly can't wait for part II.  As far as image quality of the disc, it is outstanding along w/the sound.  Do yourself a favor if you are a horror fan and watch it.  Don't listen to the other bad reviews, if you like movies like, Blade, Kindred-The Embraced,Ultraviolet and Forever Knight, etc.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|OK I ALWAYS KNEW THAT THIS CD WAS GOING TO BE HOT BUT I DIDNT EXPECT IT TO BE THIS HOT. I LOVE ALL THE SONGS AND I JUST HAVE TO SAY JOD WELL DONE BRITNEY.

0062502182|4.0|As stated in the title of the book this is a fable about following your dreams. It is fairly short and an easy read. It is set long ago, but it is completely familiar. It makes some obvious points (follow your dreams) but also some more subtle ones. The more subtle ones have to do with observing omens and believing that the universe (or god or whomever) helps you in the beginning of your journey and challenges you in the end. While there is probably some logical explanation it helps to think of it in these mystical terms. All in all a worthwhile read.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is an awesome CD!!!!! Her voice is beautiful. There are Trendy, hip dance beats, lyrics, and variety of just plain new POP. I'm in my 30's and thought I am to old for this music??? No way! She rocks!! It's very rare to get a new CD and love almost every song???!!!! This seems to find it's way to my CD player every day! Very impressed. I have a feeling &quot;In the Zone&quot; will be on the charts for a long time!!!!
0440237688|5.0|4.5 of 5 stars - Highly Recommended<br />Over the past two days, I finished reading The Giver.  (There are no spoilers here.)  This was a great book.  Today, many assume that higher degrees of efficiency of a society and its members are intrinsic goods for the advancement of the human specie.  Brave New World is one book that takes that assumption to an extreme, and notes the perversity and inhumanness that result from such an extremely efficient society.  The Giver is another such book, one that is less dark and less explicitly bitter than BNW.  The settings and plots of these hyper-efficient societies are different enough that make both books interesting and poignant reads.  However, as BNW is definitely suited exclusively for an adult audience, The Giver is enriching to both adolescent and adult.  And whereas BNW is science fiction mixed with biting satire, The Giver is more of a lighthearted science fiction with a hint of fantasy -- the way in which the Receiver receives his experiential knowledge.<br />The protagonist of this story is an early adolescent, as the author's hope seems to be for young readers to try to relate to Jonas.  This book is a good teaching tool that one can use in trying to teach younger (maybe even older) ones to think more critically about life, to break out of the sphere of popular culture in which so many young ones are comfortable, yet suffocating in ignorance.  The author's writing style is crisp and lucid, the way that I prefer my authors to be.  I give this book 4.5 stars, but I'm rounding up.  My only complaint is that I disliked how open-ended the ending is.  I appreciate the author's desire to be artistic and ambiguous, but I felt that for this type of young adult's book, she should've made a stronger sense of closure.  Aside from that minor complaint, I enjoyed reading this book, and the author kept me engaged from beginning to end.
1400031354|5.0|The title, we learn on the last page, refers to doing what one can, for giving whatever one is able, to help the larger world.  Giraffes in the Kalahari can offer only their tears.  Our betrothed hero and heroine, the stalwart Mr. J.L.B. Maketoni and the shrewd Mma Precious Ramotswe expand their hearts-and in turn ours-when they adopt two orphans.  Nothing turns out exactly as expected, either in this series or in life.  And that's not necessarily a letdown.  I absolutely loved this book!  It made me laugh and cry.  Beautifully, lovingly  conceived and crafted.  Unmistakably, the Scottish author found (or found again) his own heart in Africa.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|Donnie Darko is a film about existence, death, and teenage angst. Donnie Darko is beautiful, and powerful, and funny all at the same time. Though the film isn't perfect, freshman writer/director Richard Kelley delivers enough great moments to make Donnie Darko a must-see.<br />I always say that I love seeing a film that shows me something new. Donnie Darko isn't a cliche teen horror film, and it's not a silly sci-fi rehash. I didn't know anything about the plot of Donnie Darko beforehand - and I'm glad I didn't. This film is deep and thoughtful; thoughtful in a way that stays with you intensely for several hours.<br />I must give a specific mention to the original music in Donnie Darko. All of the music is a perfect complement to the film's mood - somber, yet positive. Additionally, the theme song for the film is just stunning. Who would have thought a remake of the Tears For Fears song &quot;Mad World&quot; would work so well here?<br />Jake Gyllenhaal does a fine job playing the disturbed lead character. His task is not an easy one. Gyllenhaal has to play a character that is simultaneously smart, scared, and drugged. Also very good is Mary McDonnell as Donnie's mother. A lesser director might have painted Donnie's parents as mean or unsympathetic. The only bad performance was Drew Barrymore. Thankfully, she only has about six minutes of screen time. Other than Barrymore, almost all of the performances are very good.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Im back to say, I put the cd away for a few weeks, I just played new years eve, Its still so fresh, I cant belive how any here feel this is a major disapointmnet, Give the women a break,Its now 2004, Im sure Madonna will prove to most of you nuckle heads haters That she's NOT out of ideas.<br />American Life may not haved live to long on the charts, But it made it there, and will live on to us true understanding MADONNA fans. I say beware poeple! MADONNA has something under her sleeves for late 2004 and 2005 she will be everywhere agian like 1984 and 1985. Madonna will end the year with a top 40 hit. Till then new update on the princess of POP.<BR>   <br />This spring janet jackson will be back for the summer new album and tour. And will performing at the superbowl....
B00005RFVL|5.0|A good jazzy, swinging album ala Michael Buble.  If you liked Buble's Cd along with Josh Groban, You'll like what Robbie Williams does here.  Great with a bunch of duets with Nicole Kidman, Rupert Evrett and others.
B000002MY3|5.0|I bought this cd on a whim during a trip where I really didn't have a whole lot to do.  It's the best cd in my collection now.  This cd is not girl power, it's woman power.  It kills you again and again and then resurrects you just when you think you've gotten into a rut.  The vocals are fantastic, not everyobdy's thing, but I love how it only adds to the honesty.  The song's literally come back to you later.  I would be interrupted after one verse and be dying to see what came after.  It's true artistic genius and truth.  It can easily be compared to Nirvana's music, it's that raw.  And if you really want thrills, listen to the hidden track's second song.  Amazing.  A must for any CD collection especially since it was rated the best rock CD in the last 22 years by Vh1.  They really know their stuff.  I was very impressed and I know you'll love it too.
B0000CEB4V|4.0|I just got the DVD for Christmas and loved it. I thought the music selected was great. It included Beatles, Traveling Wilbury's and his solo work. Highlights were &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps (Clapton/McCartney/Starr), &quot;Something&quot; (McCartney),<BR>&quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; (Preston), Taxman(Petty),&quot;Handle With Care (Lynne) and many more. It was great seeing George's son onstage playing with the band. This DVD is a wonderful tribute to George Harrison.<BR>P.S. To some of the reviewers of this DVD, the Paul McCartney bashing is getting old !!!
B00008ADPF|4.0|First of all, I want to go on the record as saying that I enjoyed Long Road better than Silver Side Up.  I love both albums, but Long Road seemed like a more mature CD than the previous ones.  I was very impressed with what I heard.  I think that if you liked Silver Side Up you'll also really appreciate the band's new attempts in Long Road.  The songs are much more clear but stick to the grunge roots of their nature.  I can't wait to see what else they come up with, I know I'll be impressed.
B00012FXB8|3.0|Rodney Dangerfield has company. Alien 3 doesn't get any respect from most film critics or fans of the series.  Is this tarnished reputation earned? Not exactly. The original project was botched from the moment Fox committed to a premiere date without a director, final script or solid concept. After director Vincent Ward (who came up with story elements that were used in the final version, hence his story credit), Renny Harlin and other directors passed, David Fincher stepped into the director's shoes.<br />The story focuses on a prison planet where a few inmates left after most of the operation has been closed down. Ripley crash lands on the planet after a malfunction and is saved by the doctor for the prisoners. There are problems. The prison is made up of all men. Ripley provides temptation from the very moment she arrives. Of course, she had an uninvited passenger on the trip. A face hugger infects one of the animals on the planet. Ripley finds herself in a similar situation as before fighting for her life but this time those around her are almost as dangerous and homocidal as the Alien creature hunting them.<br />FIncher hadn't directed a feature film before only commericals but had a solid grounding in film and optical effects (he got his start at ILM). When he came on board, the script hadn't been finished but he was forced to move forward with production due to an impending release date. Despite all this, he stylistically pleasing variation on Scott's original theme. Killing two charactes from the second film didn't win Fincher or the film any fans. Finally, during post-production the film was edited without Fincher's input at all.<br />There are a number of marvelous performances in Alien 3. Charles Dance as the doctor lights up the screen and Charles Dutton captures your attention with his riveting portrayal as the religious leader of these converted murderers. There are also a number of great British character actors in the mix as well. The set pieces of the film work better than the film as a whole. The funeral sequence with its multiple exposures is a moving testament to the power of the film. It's brilliantly staged and shot.<br />The Extended version here is superior to the final cut of the film. There's bits and pieces that fill in some of the enormous story gaps left by the botched theatrical cut of the film. The effects are occasionally subpar but the few scenes where they don't work can be overlooked. The atmosphere of the film is what sells it. Like Scott's original and Cameron's sequel, Alien 3 operates on its own terms. Fincher's well known for directing atmospheric and riveting thrillers and Alien 3, despite its imperfections, has much of the power of Fincher's other films (Seven, The Game). The extended workprint version reassembled here beats the theatrical version despite the unfinished quality of the film. Alien 3 still isn't a perfect film and, given the quality of the final script by Giler, Hill and Larry Ferguson, I don't know if it could ever have been a pefect film. It's got merit though and deserves a second look from fans.<br />The extras are the same as what was on the Alien Quadrilogy boxed set from last year. Fincher chose not to participate in the making recutting of Alien 3 and, given his experience, who could blame him? As a result, there's no director's commentary from him. Key cast and crew members do give an interesting run down on the difficulties of completing the film.<br />The documentary included on the making of the film was butchered prior to Fox releasing the film. 30 minutes of footage featuring very critical comments from Fincher made on the set and with cast and crew comments were cut. As they say, success has many fathers failure has none. Clearly Fox was hoping to soften the criticism of the studio in botching this release when it came out in theaters. It's a pity as it does provide more perspective.<br />Picture quality for both versions is very good although the extendedworkprint has somewhat dicey sound quality for the sequences that were cut/not included on the original release. That's because the dialogue was never looped after production and some of it (particularly during a key scene involving Charles Dance)is almost inaudible.<br />Although Alien 3 isn't the classic of its two predecessors, it has many brilliant sequences and performances that make it well worth viewing. Give it a second chance if you didn't like it the first time.ed workprint has somewhat dicey sound quality for the sequences that were cut/not included on the original release.

B00004XPPC|5.0|Like many people, I saw the BOTRK on television first, back in the media-challenged 1960's.  Even through the pan and scan and low-res color of those ancient TV's, Lean's film riveted me to the screen. It wasn't until the late 1980's and hi-end VHS releases of films came out that I finally saw the widescreen version, and saw what I'd been missing for years.  Lean was one of the few directors who could fill the widescreen and create drama without cutting a film to pieces in an attempt to generate excitement.<br />Alec Guiness etched himself into the ages with his performance as the pathological Col. Nicholson who abides by the letter of the law to the point of utter lunacy. When he and Sessue Hayakawa face off one sees the immovable object meeting the irressistable force.  The whole attempt at breaking Nicholson plays like a prison/chain-gang film from the 1930's, but there is more at stake here - Nicholson's view is that order should be prevail regardless of circumstances, while Saito's view is that circumstances dictate order.  The class and racial issues emenate from this conflict like waves of radioactivity.<br />William Holden appears in this film as a means of getting American finance - but he is nonetheless effective as the shirker, fraud, hero and cynic(his character from Sunset Boulevard onwards).  Jack Hawkins is suitabily manipulative as  the Oxford Don turned demonlition man.<br />But the real star of this film is the jungle matched to the widescreen.  The sweep of green tangle in which this drama enacts strangles the life and sanity from the people enmeshed in the struggle.  Lean knew how to create shots in depth, so his films are always more than what the characters are doing on the screen.<br />Like Apocalypse Now, another tale of Western soldiers in the jungle, this production was fraught with difficulties, the most damaging of which was a cameraman's failure to shoot the more important angle of the bridge's destruction.  In the CGI world this could never happen, but in the awesome realtime destruction of BOTRK, Lean's crew had to rebuild the bridge, rescue the train, and redo the shot.  It was worth it.<br />The DVD restores this film to it's proper aspect ration, sound, and probably has better color than the original, although, having never seen it in a theatre, I can't say.<br />For a real and disturbing look at what actually happened in Japanese POW camps, read \\"Prisoners of the Sun.\\"ld never happen, but in the awesome realtime destruction of BOTRK, Lean's crew had to rebuild the bridge, rescue the train, and redo the shot.

0393057658|5.0|This book is one of twists and turns, full of literary vehicles.  I haven't felt this dizzy since I saw Pulp Fiction (to which I would not give 5 stars).  It's great to see those that deserve to win in baseball win--especially against Steinbrenner--at least in the regular season, as the Oakland A's have done for the past several years.  And this, on a budget that rivals what the Yankees' bullpen alone costs.<br />Given the buzz on the book, I was prepared for Lewis' discussion on how statistical science is changing the game, which he does so without losing the quick tempo he establishes from the leadoff page.  However, his greatest achievement was a surprise to me--he gets us close in to meet the obscured, brilliant personalities that have contributed to the Little Paradigm Shift That Could, over the protestations of eight generations of baseball scouts and owners barking up the wrong mathematical trees to preserve traditions without foundation.<br />Most good baseball books are autobiographies, or written by insiders, or written by those obsessed with the game.  Lewis is able to write effectively as an outsider, and also closely connect and earn the trust of the insiders.<br />Beyond the math, I hope that baseball insiders will use the truth of Moneyball to make MLB more competitive than it is today, instead of pleading with Congress to preserve a questionable status quo.

B000001FA4|5.0|Unforgettable Fire is easily my faovrite U2 album to date. I don't care what they say about &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; but I found that album to be rather uneven. THe singles are great on that album but the non-singles are half-way decent at best.<br /> The Unforgettable Fire on teh other hand is amazing from start to finish and has absolutely no filler. I especially love the title track with it's dreamy hypnotizing sound. &quot;Bad&quot; is a powerful anthem for the ages.<br /> I also love the instrumental &quot;4th of July&quot; which is a stunningly beautiful interlude song that preludes &quot;Bad&quot; which is one of U2's greatest achievmeents!<br /> This is easily U2's best album.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Now readers.  Britney Spears gets flack for \\"what she wears, what she says\\" but guess what? Shes \\"not a little girl anymore\\" and damn does she prove it with this album.<br />Firstly take note Britney has increased her song writing credits from the album \\"Britney\\" and claims to have written her first solo track \\"Everytime\\" however the cd leaflet contradicts this claim.  Saying that Britney recently showed viewers of a concert special herself playing \\"Everytime\\" on the piano and singing the song which adds credit to Miss or is that Mrs Spears claim.<br />On a song level \\"In The Zone\\" is a pretty mature album and in my opinion truly lifts Britneys \\"american sweetheart\\" image away.  It begins with the average track \\"Me Against The Music\\" a fast paced song which has Britney dueting with Madonna in which she asks listeners to \\"let me see you dance!\\".  This is followed by \\"I Got That (Boom Boom)\\" a song where Britney brings the pop and the ying yang twins bring the hip-hop.  Both styles gel well and give you a song which begs you to do what \\"Me Against The Music\\" asked - dance!  \\"Showdown\\" has a pretty basic beat which Britney seductively whispers over, telling a mystery person to \\"undo her zipper, please\\".  A brilliant track which is highly addictive.  next we have \\"Early Morn'n\\" the Moby produced track.  On first listen this didn't do much for me till I found the lyrics and realised the WHOLE song is a story including the names of Britneys friends - Jen & Gabe.  Britney seems at ease on this track and her vocals are really good, very laid back as is the beat.  \\"Toxic\\" the follow up song to \\"Me Against The Music\\" is a fast paced track which hits so many levels.  It seems to take influences from pop, classic Bond soundtracks and electro.  A unique sound where Britney excels, destined to be a hit.  R.Kelly makes an appearance with \\"Outrageous\\" a typical R.Kelly track with a real addictive RnB beat and a surprise bridge which I like due to the way Britney sings it.  Very repetitive but highly addictive.  On the \\"Hook Up\\" Britney tries to go all reggae and makes a decent job but without the proper accent it doesn't have the full \\"bang\\" which tracks like Sean Paul and Kevin lytlle have.  A nice beat which is chirpy - best party track on the album.  \\"Shadow\\" appears out of the blue as the first balled.  With tints of rock to it it sounds similair to Avril Lavingnes \\"I'm With You\\" you get an idea of the power and emotion Britney has in her vioce from this track.  \\"Brave New Girl\\" - why? Oh why? Oh why?  Starts of nice with Britney rapping over a bouncy (think Material Girl) beat then slowly it builds and builds until Britney is singing over a pure pop chorus in a plastic sounding voice aided by vocoders.  I was shocked to discover this on \\"In The Zone\\" as it seemed very \\"tween\\" which as the rest of the album is very much for Britneys age group. Yuck!  \\"Everytime\\" is the last original track to finish the album.  With lots of instruments and britney softly singing over how she ruined a relationship you get a real insight into how Britney feels over her relationship with Justin.  It is filled with emotion and portrays pretty in a nice way.  Unfortunately, Jive and Britney chose to end the album with a remix of \\"Me Against The Music\\" which ends the album in a bad way.  Same lyrics as the original but different beat it is nothing special and it doesn't sound quite right after hearing the original.  Something which I think should have been recognised as a mistake early on.  \\"Touch Of My Hand\\" also appears on the album and \\"Breathe On Me\\" both amazing tracks.  \\"Breathe On Me\\" is very euro stlyed trance similair to tracks which have came from kylie Minogue.  Britney begs to be breathed on and moans in seductive way.  On \\"Touch Of My Hand\\" britney approaches the topic of masturbation in a very smart way without showing any smuttyness and she sounds amazing on vocal.  very Janet Jackson - \\"Thats The Way Love Goes\\".<br />All in all - Britney makes astatement and a transistion.  She shows to the world shes grown up and now ready to show herself as an artist and be creative.  She gives a slight insight into her life but claims it as not being overly autobiographical which shows great song writing skill as she is able to write about songs which aren't based on herself.  However \\"Brave New Girl\\" comes as a shock and is only for the Britney fans which are stuck in the \\"Baby One More Time\\" days.  It makes you want to cut off your own ears.  Also ending with the remix leaves you in bad thought about an album jam packed with hits and really really good songs.  Britney has finally made an album which could be considered adult and which even deserves credibility.  Extremely good attempt.<br />P.S.  This comes from someone who likes Marylin Manson, Cradle of FIlth, 50 Cent, TLC, Coldplay, Reef, Kelis and N*E*R*D.  Just so you don't think I am a pop fan cause I can assure you i ain't,  Bitney really does excel herself.
6305907145|2.0|I read the Jane Austen \\"Mansfield Park\\" a couple of years ago, and soon after, rented the most recent movie version.  I have to say- I would've liked the film 100 times more if I hadn't read the book.  Alessandro Nivola is charming as Henry Crawford.  Frances O'Connor is entirely lovable as Fanny Price.  But if you're looking for a film solely based on that Austen you read, turn around and find another version-THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.  I think the real issue was that the people who made this film didn't like the book quite enough.  If they had liked it more, they might not have decided to give the characters lines they'd never spoken.  Jane Austen is/was a fabulous writer, terribly witty, etc.  I could understand thinking Fanny is a tiny bit dull-but if you don't like her-leave her as she is and try your hand at something more Elizabeth Bennet-ish; just don't take Austen's work (her own \\"child\\") and bend it to your will.  At least, that's what I'd say to the writer.  There.  Done ranting.
B000001Y2U|3.0|I don't care what any youth-group or money-grubbing, hypocritical preacher says (that means YOU, Pat Robertson) This guy isn't as bad as you religious nuts say he is. It's no less of an act than Ziggy Stardust. Shock-rock, you say? The shock is all in your head. Just like Slim Shady, he is whatever you say he is and he doesn't really care one way or the other so long as he's making an impression on you. Be it fear or fondness.<br />I don't get why everyone fights over Marilyn Manson. The church groups dislike him because he's just another thing they don't understand and the music fans complain that he is a sell out. How did he sell out? Everything's fine until you leave the underground and become popular isn't it? Then you're just crap. That's a wonderful way to treat somebody who's busting their hump to make music for your discerning taste.<br />Brian may borrow from some other past looks and ideals (David Bowie, Gary Numan, Alice Cooper) but he does have his own style and agenda. Speaking of Alice.. Didn't that old geezer get \\"saved\\" or some kinda junk? There's your sell-out right in front of you. When Brian prays for forgiveness on his death-bed.. then and only then will I call him a sell out. And maybe that will be his last shock before he leaves us...<br />And here's a shocker, every band you listen to now can be traced back to a band from before.. so they're >ALL< copying off of somebody. Originality is dead and has been dead ever since 'retro' got big. But when given the choice I'd rather listen to this than that Debbie Gibson knock-off, Brittany Spears. I want music that is trying to say something to me other than \\"Drink pepsi and look at my perky breasts!\\"<br />I do like some underground and lesser known bands but some stuff is just too hard to get into. Mr. Manson's music is exciting compared to what else is out there on the radio and TV. He makes goth palatable for those like me who're too lazy to try and understand Joy Division or Sisters of Mercy. NIN did the same thing for industrial. Skinny Puppy and Thrill Kill Cult are fine and dandy but some of it is just too eclectic, and who wants to listen to a band they >DON'T< like just so they can be cool and fit in? <br />Not that those aren't good bands. I prefer stuff like Mindless Self Indulgence, Inkkubus Sukkubus, Ophelia Rising, Razed in Black, VNV Nation, Cruxshadows, and the awesome japanese metal band: Malice Mizer (ironic that Manson is rumored to have consulted Mana for his fashion ideas ^.^) and us \\"goth\\" folks don't know real metal? Try SLAYER on for size and forget Slipknot ever existed.<br />It amazes me they STILL show the same video in youth-group and sunday school about how horrible Slayer and Dungeons and Dragons is for out prescious little children.  So if the christians are still yapping about them now.. they must've done SOMETHING right. I have a wide and varied musical taste. I don't sit around all day listening to ONLY Nine Inch Nails and Marylin Manson. And I DON'T watch MTV, atleast not since the recent influx of hip-pop and the rap-rock scene. <br />Okay, now that I'm done ranting.<br />This >IS< a good album, although I do prefer their ealier stuff like \\"Portrait of An American Family\\" they were alot less produced back then and had a more realistic guitar driven sound with less synth. But that's not saying that 'Antichrist' isn't good. Some of the songs like \\"Tourniquet\\" and \\"Beautiful People\\" are very memorable. \\"Man That You Fear\\" is very sad but not as good as the Pink Floyd-ish \\"Speed of Pain\\" (compare to Comfortably Numb) from the album 'Mechanical Animals'<br />The other songs are good as well but most folks are too lazy to listen to an album all the way through so they never get to hear them. I love \\"The Reflecting God,\\" its like Brian is talking about how he creates his own world inside his mind and in that world he is his own God and no one can touch him. He creates and destroys as he sees fit. <br />I love an artist who can criticize himself.<br />\\"World spreads its legs for another star.\\"<br />Brian sold himself to his music and his image. He's just another star for us to crucify/sanctify and he knows full well that he is martyring himself for his cause, becoming the anti-christ that everyone loves to hate or the alledged \\"sell-out\\" that everyone loves to take shots at and he honestly doesn't give a damn what you think. In his world, you don't exist.. 'You can kill yourself now because your dead in my mind'<br />He does his own thing and if you like him and get the joke, that's great. If you don't understand and you protest at his concerts and blame your children's suicides/school shootings on his songs, well that's good too. No such thing as \\"Bad Press.\\" Your fear and stupidity sell the records for him the same way it did for Ozzy Osbourne and Slayer. The same goes for Eminem. If the preachers and parents hate it then that gives the kiddies all the more reason to buy it, crank it loud and proud, and aggravate the heck out of you with it.<br />Oh c'mon.. like you didn't drive your folks crazy with KISS, Black Sabbath, or AC/DC in the 70's when you were a young'un? Back in YOUR parents' day that was theeee evil music right there *snickers* Now its in constant rotation on the Classic Rock radio stations. I wonder what my kids will be listening to when... Oh wait, I don't have any kids.. But if I did, I'd eat them with fava beans and a nice kiante. <br />\\"I've always measured sucess not only by the ammount of people that love you but the ones that hate you too. I like to provoke people so that they think. I think that's a healthy part of entertainment... that you don't get too much from the Spice Girls.\\"<br />-Rev. Brian Warner, David Letterman interview.
0440236738|5.0|Having only discovered Harlan Coben a few weeks ago, I thought nothing could surpass his masterpiece Tell No One but to my surprise and delight this novel Gone For Good actually achieves that.  Granted it doesn't grip your immediately from page one as Tell No One does but once you've read a few chapters, like with that brilliant book, you won't be able to put it down until the final page either.<br />In Gone for Good, Will Klein's mother has just died, telling him on her dieing breath that his brother Ken, who they thought was murdered along with Will's ex girlfriend, is still alive.  While going through his mother's possessions with his current girlfriend Sheila, Will comes across a recent photograph of his brother with snow capped mountains in the background, he has aged but it is obviously Ken.  The FBI want to know where Ken is, as do some other people who do not have a problem with murder and torture, one of them is known as the ghost and he's a particularly, evil character.  When Sheila is murdered it is up to Will and his friend Squares to find his brother before more people die.<br />If you've never read a Coben book before you are in for a literary treat.  If you've only read the Myron Bolitar series books then prepare to read a Coben book of an even higher level.  Whilst the Bolitar books are good, you know most about  Myron and that ultimately he will survive for another sequel but when Coben writes with fresh new characters the stories are full of mystery and the characters can go anywhere that Coben's imagination takes us. If you like the character Win, from the Bolitar series you'll love Square.  He's a more realistic but equally interesting side kick/guardian of the main character.  Gone for good is brilliant, it is full of twists and you won't put it down until the final chapter, so make sure there's nothing good on TV before starting, or just buy a blank tape as well.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I have been playing this DVD non-stop since I purchased it the day it was released.  It's a beautiful, thrilling and moving show.  I agree with Diane about the McCartney bashing.  He was visibly moved and gave a wonderful but subdued performance.  His rendition of All Things Must Pass is an emotional highlight for me.
B00004TA41|4.0|This album has got to be Coltranes'(or any other saxophonist) boldest work ever. The sheer power behind this album is mind boggling. Jupiter was by far the hardest one to listen to. It took five years before I could actually sit there listen to the whole album. When I first go the album I was a new commer to Jazz. I had some of Coltranes work, but only his early work like Blue trane, and Giants Steps. But I took a huge step too far foward when I got this album. I got thru 5 minutes of it. After that I was afraid to listen to the album. To this day I still can't understand the whole thing. While I believe that this album is a milestone in music, I would not recommend this album to anyone. Only to those adventurous enough to have their minds challenged and stretched and at times pummeled in ways that is beyond all human comprehension. This not for begenners.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Chris Cornell could front a food processor and and still tear it to shreads. His vocal intensity and biting lyrics are unparalled. This album lacks a little of the diversity of Superunknown (the- tragically- last Soungarden outing), but Chris' wailing saves the day. Definitely worth while.
0380789019|5.0|I had never heard of Neil Gaiman until I read about him in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; last year.  I immediatelty picked up this book at the recommendation of the fans of the author.<br />I couldn't put it down.  Excellent read, very entertaining and worth reading over and over again.  I have also seen the BBC Mini-Series, which actually came before the book, and recommend seeing that after you read the book.  If you do it the other way around, you will probably be disappointed.<br />After loving this book so much, I tried &quot;American Gods&quot;.  Was I ever disappointed.  I guess you can't love everything an author writes.  I am waiting for a follow-up to this magnificent piece we call &quot;Neverwhere&quot;!!  5 stars *****
B00004Z459|5.0|Yes, this CD is great, its about time we get another great rap/rock band.  Chester is the coolest lead singer EVER!!!
B00008EYA5|1.0|I didnt waste my money going to see this at the show. <BR>Knowing it would be the tripe it really is thank god i had<BR>a free rental are i be kicking my self in the arse. This is <BR>so lame I won't even bother talking about it insted i will <BR>name some &quot;REAL ACTION&quot; flicks with an actual story and not <BR>just a bigger budget sequeal to speed. Try Hard Boiled,The Killer<BR>A better tomarrow 1 &amp; 2 John Woo works of art before doing <BR>American movies. Heat, Ronin, All of Tarantino's works and Leon you know movies that are closer to reality then anything else and don't have to have music in every scene to make up for crappy dialogue so if you want real action check em out but if your another teeny stick to your mindless dribble.
B000002BPS|5.0|I first heard The Offspring about four years ago after picking up Crazy Taxi for the Dreamcast (great game, by the way). Their two songs on the soundtrack - &quot;All I Want&quot; and &quot;Way Down the Line&quot; - greatly enhanced the fast-paced mood of the game and have been buried in my subconscience ever since. So, this past Christmas, Santa came through with Ixnay on the Hombre, and I was really blown away. However, if you generally dislike punk, there's little chance of you liking this one. Granted, there is a lot of crappy pop punk out there, but The Offspring really have a good vibe thanks to the talented vocal work of Dexter Holland, as well as catchy electric guitar riffs from Holland, Noodles, and bassist Greg K. Ixnay was released back in 1997, but many of its tracks are still unforgettable. From the moving, angst-ridden &quot;Gone Away&quot; to the catchy energetic rant &quot;Cool to Hate&quot; to the high-octane closer &quot;Change the World&quot; (which contains a really nice opening drum solo), Ixnay on the Hombre is a rollicking good time from start to finish. If you're of the unbearable type who constantly whines about music needing &quot;conflicts&quot; and &quot;messages&quot;, or you feel the need to be cutting-edge or hardcore, you'll do best to avoid this one. The Offspring bring nothing new to the table, and their lyrics aren't exactly of the soul-searching variety. For everyone else who just wants to rock, Ixnay on the Hombre is a fantastic piece of work, and should ring true to fans of the genre. If you think it's for you, don't hesitate to buy-you won't be disappointed.
B00005JMGL|5.0|We all know the story of Peter Pan.  But this movie brings the story of the boy who never grew up, to life.  It was fun taking my kids to the movie, mainly because there are so many more themes in the movie that are relevant to me, now as a parent, than when I was my children's ages.  The dazzling special effects makes this movie so real to life, it actually will make adults begin to say \\"I do! I do! I do believe in fairies....\\"
0375432302|3.0|I received this as a Christmas Gift.  Like other reviewers here, I began investigating some of Mr. Brown's suppositions.  That is exactly what they were.  Although there is a measure of truth in the fact that these secret societies existed, there is no evidence of the suppositions he makes beyond that.  In fact, his 'research' is text from other books. It is a good thing that the book is listed as &quot;ficition&quot;.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Your ears will thank you for buying this album. You can really chill out to it with all the musical styles covered - pop, techno, rock but where it really shines is the bluesy gospel/electronic fusion with the awesome tracks Natural Blues &amp; Run On, yes I love the blues but you don't have to be biased towards any particular type of music to enjoy this album as it cleverly mixes most genres. Easily 5 stars as I can't think of any weak points on this.
0783225849|5.0|By now, there are few people who don't alrady relate director Alfred Hitchcock with some of the most spine-tingling films of all time.  Having brought such features as &quot;Vertigo&quot; and &quot;The Birds&quot; to the big screen forever more concreted his name in the annals of film history as one of the true visionaries of the genre.  But perhaps his masterpiece, the most memorable film of his career, is the one that introduced audiences for the first time to the genre of the serial killer.  &quot;Psycho&quot;, starring Janet Leigh, would forever change the face of horror.<br />Marion Crane (Leigh) is a struggling secretary working for a real-estate salesman.  Having returned from a rendevous with her somewhat estranged boyfriend, Sam Loomis (John Gavin), she realizes that the two of them can only be together in a &quot;legitimate&quot; sense, if he can first settle a divorce between he and his wife.  What's more, his debts are large, and she knows that he will never fully be part of her life until his debts are paid.<br />As fate would have it, her boss had just closed a deal with a wealthy client, who insisted on paying for the house with cash.  Entrusted with the money, Marion leaves work early, having suddenly come down with a headache.  She heads home instead and begins to frantically pack her things so that she can drive out to meet her boyfriend who lives in Fairvale, California, which is several hundred miles from her own residence.  Without pause she sets out with the money in hand to meet him, convinced that she can solve their problems by using the money afforded her by the boisterous man she met earlier that day.<br />As she drives across country, she has a run-in with a police officer, and immediately, she begins to feel the paranoia that anyone guilty of a crime would feel.  As she continues her ventures west, her mind races with the scenarios that could unfold for her in the near future.  Weary of the road, and a bit down-trodden by her guilt, shepulls off the main hightway when a heavy rain unexpectedly begins to fall.  The road she travels brings her to the neon sign of a local motel &quot;The Bates Motel.&quot;<BR>She pulls in and goes into the front office where she is met by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins).<br />Checking in under a false name, Bates invites her to dinner at his home, a large, run-down house on a hill behind the motel.  She accepts his invitation, asking first if she can freshen up.  Bates agrees and heads up to the house after showing her the room she will be staying in.  <br />While freshening up, she hears an argument from the house between Norman and a woman, whom Bates identifies as his &quot;mother&quot;.  Bates returns a short time later with a tray of food in hand, and apologizes, stating this mother is &quot;ill&quot; (mentally, not physically.)  They eat in his parlor instead, and during the course of their conversation, Marion realizes that she must return home, for she has made a mistake.  She retires to her room where she prepares to shower.<br />She never finishes the shower.  A woman, silhouetted in the darkness, attacks her unexpectedly, stabbing her repeatedly until she collapses into the basin of the tub, dead.  The silhouette figure flees the scene and before long, Norman returns, discovering the gruesome scene that has unfolded, knowing that the killer is none other than his mother.<br />And so the story truly begins.<br />What's interesting about &quot;Psycho&quot;, originally a novel written by Robert Bloch, is that the exposition of the story reminds us that &quot;we all go a little mad sometimes.&quot;  This simple premise is the underscoring of this story, for each of the characters, from Marion Crane through Norman Bates have a series of actions that are very cause and effect, suggesting that madness is relative to the situation and the events that impact each individual life.<br />Filmed entirely in black and white (despite the fact that films were commonly shotin color by this time), the movie uses light and shadow to incredible effect.  Where movies of today, especially in the horror genre, rely so heavily on special effects, this movie has virtually none, relying instead on situation, dialogue and character development to portray the slightly off-kilter world that only grows more distorted as the movie continues to its shocking, and (at the time it was filmed) very disturbing conclusion.<br />For anyone who has never seen this film, it is important to understand that, though timid by today's standards, this movie was so shocking at it's time that many viewers left the theater, unable to watch the movie, for its intensity was so great that it affected many audiences all over the country.  In viewing it, make sure that you watch the original Hitchcock edition.  There was a remake of the film in the 90's starring Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates and Anne Heche as Marion Crane.  Though a decent enough remake, it attempted, and in this reviewers humble opinion, failed to re-capture the essence of Hitchcock's genious. <br />The movie, whose cast also included Vera Miles as Lila Crane (Marion's sister), Martin Balsam (Detective Milton Arbogast), and Patricia Hitchcock (Alfred's daughter), is considered a film classic, and one of the AFI top 100 movies of all time.  It truly is a classic that has set the standard for the horror genre for all time to come.  Though many efforts have been made to recapture the essence of this film, there have been few entries in the annals of horror films that have even come close, save for maybe the original &quot;Halloween&quot; by John Carpenter. (INTERESTING SIDE NOTE: Jamie Lee Curtis, who made her debut as &quot;scream-queen&quot; in Carpenter's Halloween is Janet Leigh's daughter.) <br />-Scott Kolecki
B0000640VO|5.0|I'm not big on foreign films, and frankly the thought of having to read subtitles througout a movie almost guarantees I won't watch it.  A friend of mine said this was a great movie and I decided to give it a try.  I'm glad I did, I thought it was so cute, and definately charming.  The subtitles didn't even bother me after the first fifteen minutes or so.  Even my boyfriend liked it!
B00005O3VC|5.0|From the trumpet flourish at the beginning of the film, followed by the approach of Arthur galloping on foot with the sounds of coconuts being smacking against one another by his minstrel, to the climactic finish of the film, when the Knights of Camelot are seized while attacking a French Castle for actions against a news commentator earlier in the film, has history been so humorously re-&quot;created&quot; as it has been in this brilliantly funny film by the British Troupe of comedic actors known affectionately by fans world wide as &quot;Monty Python&quot;.<br />&quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; is a tongue-in-cheek look at the lore surrounding the Arthurian Legend and his quest for the Holy Grail.  The film pulls no punches, taking jabs at everything from the political strife between the French and the British, the Catholic Church, the Inquisition, the British Aristocracy and just about every legend and myth surrounding King Arthur and the Knights of the Roundtable.<br />When Arthur (Graham Chapman) is approached by God to discover the secret resting place of the Holy Grail, he at once sets out on a quest to find it, picking up his entourage of knights along the way: Sir Lancelot the Brave (John Cleese), Sir Launcelot (Eric Idle), Sir Bedevere (Terry Jones), and Sir Galahad the Pure (Michael Palin).<br />While on their quests, each face a variety of hilarious challenges, including the construction of a Trojan Rabbit, the approach of Castle Anthrax with the multidle of Vestial Virgins, <BR>the rabbit with &quot;big, pointy, teeth&quot;, and of course, the Knights who say &quot;Ni&quot;.<br />Originally filmed in 1975, the movie has become a cult-classic, and a favorite for many generations of Monty Python enthusiasts.  Considered by many to be their most successful feature film, the Holy Grail relies on a careful combination of slapstick humor combined with clever writing and high-brow British wit.  Though some of the humor relates to the period the filmwas shot, most of it transcends any generation, poking fun at history with an originality and absurdity that is funny and entertaining.<br />Make sure to pay close attention to the many characters throughout the film, for many of the &quot;Python&quot; principals play more than one character.  In many instances, Eric Idle, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones can be seen carrying on conversations with themselves.  Its one of the many hilarious twists that the Monty Pyhton troupe use in their films.<br />This is a great film for anyone who has yawned their way through a world history class in high-school or college.  It brings a slanted and hilarious version of history to life in a way that only the men of Monty Python can.<br />-Scott Kolecki
B00005JMTN|5.0|Just got back from this movie and let me just say it much better than I thought it would be. And I had high hopes! First of all, the visuals are some of Tim Burton's best to date. The multiple fantasy worlds he has created are some of the most unique ever put to film. The acting is extremely strong, especially Albert Finney(old Edward), Ewan McGregor(young Edward), Danny Devito, Steve Buscemi(very funny role), and even the little known Billy Crudup as Edward's truth seeking son. All the rest of the cast are great as well, but have much smaller roles. Even though this film is full of funny and amusing situations, it is still at heart a serious and moving film. My eyes actually teared up at the end sequence with Albert Finney's character being taken into the river with all his friends watching on. This film will be watched by many for years to come, and some have already called it Burton's masterpiece. While the visuals alone are not impressive enough to top Sleepy Hollow, Edward Scissorhands, or even the first two Batman films, it is the Father-Son story that breathes life and warmth into an already beautiful looking film. As the wisest people claim that true beauty is on the inside rather than the outside, is only but a half truth as with some of Edward's stories in this film. Because in this rare instance, Burton has made a film that is imaginative and beautiful inside and out.
B00005JM02|5.0|Ever lost your kid in the store?...The first time I saw the movie (theater), I didn't care much for it.  First of all, I had to keep getting up with the kids to take them to the bathroom.  Then the subject matter.  It kept reminding me of the time I lost my son in Wal Mart, at the amusement park, then the time...you get the idea!  I cried when Marlin lost Nemo. <br />Then the movie had the nerve to come out on DVD!  I couldn't go through Borders without seeing it displayed somewhere; and of course the kids wanted to buy it.  Being the wonderful mom I am, I bought it.  We went home and watched it together.  I was able to really get into it and watch the parts I missed...now I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!
B0000VAFO0|3.0|I really wanted to like this movie and had hope after the exciting opening scenes, but eventually I found all the betrayals and double-crosses a bit trying.<br />Usually I'm complaining because of threadbare plots in most action movies, but UNDERWORLD may have actually tried to put too much plot in.  Kate Beckinsdale's character should have had much more screen time--or at least more character development.<br />A lot of cool special effects so early on made the film peak too soon and the middle section sags with hardly a werewolf transformation to be seen.  (A friend showed up after I'd watched the first 20 minutes or so and sat down to see a werewolf--then said &quot;Finally!&quot; when one happened near the end).<br />Although the film was marketed as a &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; type of love story, that aspect barely exists as you watch it.  When the Vampire girl kisses the human guy, you're left wondering, &quot;Where'd that come from?&quot;  It's the least developed motivation in the movie when it should've been the first.<br />Since it's always dark and raining, I can throw another movie on the pile that UNDERWORLD looks a little too derivative of: a Goth version of BLADE RUNNER.  (Everyone else has already mentioned BLADE, THE MATRIX, etc).
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I have to say I wasn't worried at all about this cd I knew the girl would deliever. She always does and  this one is I have to say the best out of all of them. My favorite trackS is Early Morning, Outragous, Touch Of My Hand, Showdown, Showdow, and Me Agaust the music remix. All I have to say is keep going because I will keep listen.
B00005JMFO|5.0|From the very first scene you are bombarded by love.  This is a new concept in modern film.  Usually we are shown great horrible violence and are made numb by fear.  <BR>This wonderful new movie has caused me to feel more love for my fellowman and I find the strength to smile and be free from all this negativity our country and our world is feeling right now.  <BR>So for this film, I am grateful and relieved.  It's like a big weight is being lifted from your shoulders.
B000002J6H|4.0|Stills' excellent first solo album, STEPHEN STILLS, was released after the 1969 CROSBY, STILLS, and NASH album, the 1970 Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young DEJA VU album and release of the Ohio/Find the Cost of Freedom single. This album and each of the other members of CSNY's first solo albums, David Crosby's IF ONLY I COULD REMEMBER MY NAME, Graham Nash's SONGS FOR BEGINNERS, and NEIL YOUNG's AFTER THE GOLDRUSH, are all strong releases. The music on Stils' album is remarkably diverse; the first song is the recognizable CSN hit single, Love The One Your With. Do For The Others is a great example of Stills' skill for acoustic songwriting, while songs like Old Times Good Times, featuring Stills playing a great organ and Jimi Hendrix on guitar, and Go back Home, guitars by Stills and Eric Clapton, are great rock songs. Black Queen showcases Stills' blues playing. To A Flame is a great, dare I say it, romantic song, which is also just an all around great mellow song. Cherokee is also a song that I really like on the album; Stills sings well and plays great guitar and there is also some interesting flute playing too. The remaining songs, Church, Sit Yourself Down, and We Are not Helpless, are also good songs that sound somewhat similar to each other with some variation among them. All in All, a great album.
B00005JMCW|3.0|this is a good decent movie that is weird  and has your head spinning in, and by the way its time for curtis to retire
B000002C1V|3.0|This album is awsome. It's lyrics are actually meningful and the rhythem and melodies by the bass and keyboards are good. The gilmore solos (though there are a few) are superb and the heart thumping of the drums mixes well. Though the creativity of the band is not much Roger Waters is the best lyricist.If only Gilmore and Waters were to come back together, then we might have something like this, and more...
B000060P79|5.0|Simple Plan is by far the best band out there if you like punk/pop/rock music....I've been a fan since they first came out around when they made their first single &quot;i'm just a kid&quot; from the original movie soundtrack The New Guy....<br />I've been to practically 5-6 concerts that they were in and they completely rock the stage like no other band before out there! They really put on a GREAT show! If you haven't had the chance to see them LIVE, i recommend that YOU DO!!!<br />Another reason why i would recommend this Simple Plan CD to you, is probably because to me... this is the one cd out there that has actually ALL THE SONGS i like to listen to, instead of those other musicians/bands where you gotta skip tracks on the cd to listen to your favorite song....
B000002R48|5.0|I honestly enjoy this album a lot and even can say I don't mind Charlie Dominicci's voice. Although he may sound too annyoing at first, his voice tone fits to the music.<br />The only things said (by fans that do not enjoy this album) that I have to agree are two clear points:<br />- the production is awfull.<br />- John Petrucci does not play great solos<br />For the rest, it is a pure and technical effort, full of complicated parts and challenging compositions and features<br />3 of DT's best songs: &quot;ytsejam&quot;, &quot;Killing Hand&quot; and &quot;Only A Matter of time&quot;.<br />The opening track &quot;A Fortune In Lies&quot; is a powerfull song and is still a favorite among fans. I like the bass sound in this song a lot, and in the album as a whole. Maybe at that time, Petrucci was not playing low notes that hide Myung's lines.<br />Obviously raw, but benefits from technical playing and great song writting.
0380002930|5.0|Without a doubt, this is one of the greatest books I have ever read.  There are loads of interesting and varied characters that make each page a fresh experience.  The story is both complex and adventurous, detailed and compelling.  I recommended this book to a friend of mine and he told me he couldn't get into a story about rabbits.  I thought, &quot;That's simplifying the novel.&quot;  This story has so many themes and countless expressions of emotions involving friendship, death, tyranny, and hope that I was forced to re-evaluate my friend's depth of character.  This is a grand adventure filled with memorable moments and thought-provoking analogies about mankind.  A brilliant novel.
B000003S0P|5.0|The first King Crimson era is considered by a lot of fans as the beginning of progressive rock as we know (or knew) today. The mind behind it was Robert Fripp, guitar player, occasional keyboard player, song writer and arranger. He was always ahead of his time. The second so-called King Crimson era gathered some of the most briliant musicians in this genre. The main line up consists of Bill Bruford (Yes, UK, etc) on drums, John Wetton (UK, Uriah HeepAsia, etc) on bass and voice and Robert Fripp on guitars and mellotron. Unlike thefirst era, this second era (which started with &quot;Larks Tongs On Aspic&quot;) was more focused in less formal structure, allowing improvisations and experimentations. &quot;Red&quot; was released in 1974, and it's an essential album to understand the progressive rock genre. The first song &quot;Red&quot; is an instrumental piece. Fripp was experimenting some dodecaphonic (12 note scales) ideas. It's unusual because Wetton plays part of the harmony on bass, while Fripp dictates the main melody. And the use of distorted guitars was a new thing for Prog Rock. This song breaks in its half, and turns into a modern piece of classical music. Bill Bruford had recently left Yes because he wanted to have more fun (when he was a Yes member he was annoyed by the serious attitude most Yes members had about their music), and here seems very content and happy. He's a master of making complex drum lines, breaking rhythms in odd signatures. His high drum tone is another classic aspect. The following song &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; has the amazing voice of John Wetton, maybe the best singer in this genre. That's a vocal oriented song, but it has violins, cellos, saxes (Mel Collins the great) and profusion of mellotron. Distortion comes on the chorus. Some sort of twisted ballad. With lots of counterpointed melodies. The 3rd piece &quot;One More red Nightmare&quot; starts with some experimentations with distortion and goes in a very pleasant moody alternating some grooving complex parts  with heavier sections. It's not an easy task to describe the beauty and complexity of this. &quot;Providence&quot; isn't what we call typical for rock. I'm not really sure but maybe that was an improvised piece. Imagine if you had a strings session, plus some  saxes and a electric band (guitars, bass and percussion) and was hugely inspired by Stravinsky. Some people say, enjoying it, is an acquired taste and maybe it  is. The piece has some intimate mood, and it seems to progress while the musicians are changing their minds. Initially sounds as noise, but then, it becomes a nice melody. And then it rocks. The last track is a super classic &quot;Starless&quot; and has some mellotron base and goes very calm and nice until Wetton opens his mouth and rocks it even more. Pure beauty. Mel Collins provides some amazing improvised saxes solos and Wetton goes singing. He's  very emotional, but strong. At some point they cut the song and start some sort  of minimalist part, and then violins, come to surface, and Bruford goes kicking ass with some brilliant percussions and complex drumming. Everything sounds as  going to a climax (heheheheheh) and so Collins comes and brings us an amazing sax  solo (Collins also kicked as on another 70s classic, Chris Squire &quot;Fish Out of Water&quot;). What  kind of music is this? Rock, Jazz, classical? Maybe the 3 at the same time. This  piece  involves the listener into some sort of catharsis until its end. &quot;Red&quot; might not be the most complex King Crimson album, but it's maybe their most important album. For all new it brought and for the power it has.g some grooving complex parts  with heavier sections.

B00005JM0B|5.0|At first I thought that since James Cameron didn't direct this film it would be horrible and wreck the terminator excperience for everyone who viewed it. I was wrong. THis movie has some of the greatest special effects in a movie that I've ever seen, the action is intense, and it answers some questions (like why the terminator keeps coming back, and why he switched from bad to good in T2). This movie even adds some humor. See it, love it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Wow! Bought this as a gift - I'd never heard of the show before, and I've long been tired of the horrible excuse for science fiction that's on TV. I was lucky enough that to borrow the DVDs after the recipient watched them - I WILL be buying this for myself. <BR>This is an excellent show. The actors, the scripts, even the plots are outstanding. This is a prime example of what's wrong with television - shows like this get butchered by the networks and replaced with mindless drivel.<BR>I can't hope to compete with the long time viewers who have already reviewed this set, but as someone who had never heard of the show before, I can assure you that this one is worth the money.<BR>Occasionally a little too violent for my young children, but not regularly.
B00004D3C1|4.0|Great cd. Great drivin' music. if you are a fan of AC/DC, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, or even Kiss, you cannot go wrong with Fu Manchu. Yeah, so the lyrics can be a bit cheesy but who the hell cares? So many bands, past and present have a HUGE cheese factor when it comes to song lyrics(ehem, Kiss..)but they still rock. Fu Manchu doesn't seem to be taking themselves too seriously and that is the key to great rock and roll!
0385504209|1.0|Some of my fellow reviewers wrote that this was a book they couldn't put down. But once I started it and I did put it down, I found the book hard to pick up again -- my mind just filled with so many other things I'd rather be doing. About half way through I gave up the fight and didn't even try to start reading again.<br />It isn't that the book is dense or difficult to read. To the contrary: I'd say that at first glance, author Dan Brown is a compelling storyteller, adept at seamlessly leading the reader from one scene to another. Sure, his constant foreshadowing is more often than not heavy handed, and some of the peripheral characters seem a little two-dimensional. But those are (unfortunately) common flaws and not the reason I was so displeased by the book.<br />What really bothered me was how much Mr. Brown got wrong. The first example is the book's title: &quot;da Vinci&quot; isn't Leonardo's family name, it is a reference to his illegitimate father, which is a reference to the father's home town of Vinci, just west of Florence. In Italian, &quot;da Vinci&quot; just means &quot;from Vinci.&quot; No, Leonardo, like his contemporaries Raffaello and Giulio Romano, like Giotto, like Caravaggio, like Rembrandt ... like modern day Cher or Madonna, is correctly referred to by his given name. The book should have been called &quot;The Leonardo Code&quot; or &quot;The Leonardo da Vinci Code.&quot;<br />Inside, there is more of the same. The author refers to some invented speculation that the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; is really a portrait of Leonardo himself in drag. Proof? Mr. Brown narrative says that computers show that key facial features are the same as those in contemporary portraits of Leonardo and that without this explanation the identity of the model is a mystery. The truth? No contemporary portraits of Leonardo exist, while the identity of the model in the famous painting is extremely well documented.<br />There is more: Leonardo's &quot;Last Supper&quot; is not a fresco, as the book says. And the idea that Mary Magdalene somehow dressed up as a man and appears in the painting in lieu of one of the apostles is more than a little far fetched.<br />I know that a novel cannot be taken as a historical document and that by definition, events are fictionalized in any work of fiction. But they have to be fictionalized in a context that is real or at least believable. If that doesn't happen, the structure of the story crumbles because we no longer know what means something and what doesn't. A more specific example: the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; carries with it certain information, who the subject was, what the painting means, who painted it, and its place in the West's cultural canon. Those factors are part of the package that simply cannot be jettisoned. If the author wanted a painting (or an artist) that didn't carry those exact meanings, then he would be better off selecting different subjects, or just making them up from scratch.<br />If a novel set in modern times included a character who drove a '78 Ford Pinto, we could draw certain conclusions about him. Maybe he doesn't have much money, or he has a bad taste in cars, or he has been forced to use this unfortunate vehicle. But if the story is written so that the Pinto is candy apple red, that it attracts &quot;oohs&quot; and &quot;ahhs&quot; from people who see it, and can race down the highway at 200 mph, then we scratch our heads. Why did the author call the car a Pinto? Wouldn't it be easier and better to have called it a Ferrari?<br />When I first started to notice these kinds of incongruities in The Da Vinci Code, I wondered if they were early clues that Robert Langdon, the main protagonist, was a bit delusional, or at least too free and easy with the facts. But it didn't take long to understand that the one who was too free and easy with the facts was the author.a fresco, as the book says.

B0000029DD|5.0|Where do you start when reviewing this cd? I purchased Grace the week it came out and it has been one of my favorites since the very first time I heard it. a soundtrack for the lovelorn and lost. I never get tired of 'lover you should have come over' and 'lilac wine.' Just like all great musical talents who have died before their time, i wonder what Jeff would have been putting out now had he lived.
B00005JMQ0|5.0|In the midst of our second preemptive war, we hear from Secretary MacNamara about how we threw away the lives of 58,000 soldiers in Vietnam.  Just as we entered Iraq fueled by a fairy tale (weapons of mass destruction), so did we enter Vietnam fueled by another fairy tale (the domino effect).  I hope the people of our nation will see this film and recognize that preemptive war is always wrong because it arrogantly assumes we know what will happen if we don't invade, and what will happen if we do.  In fact, we cannot know what will happen in any war, particularly in a part of the world where the culture is radically different from ours.  We were beaten in Vietnam and are being savaged in Iraq because of the arrogance of our leaders.  Isn't it time to elect wiser ones?
B0000AKCLS|5.0|There are a lot of people out there who play the guitar very well. A lot of them are passable singers. A lot of them can't write a lyric that doesn't start with &quot;my baby done left me&quot;. A lot of them deserve to be heard. Most of them aren't Joe Bonamassa. A child prodigy, Joe opened for B.B. King at the age of eight. He went on to play with the band Bloodline, a band comprised of the sons of Robby Krieger, Miles Davis and Berry Oakley. Legendary producer Tom Dowd produced Joe's first two albums. His third, &quot;Blues Deluxe&quot; blasts off the starting line and doesn't let up until the album concludes. The fast stuff dazzles, the slower stuff sizzles. Comprised mostly of covers, Joe chooses well with songs by Elmore James, Buddy Guy, T-Bone Walker, Robert Johnson, Albert Collins, etc. Check Joe out if you dig B.B. King, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Clapton or the Allman Brothers. A definte 5 star find!
0783226063|4.0|What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said about 400 some odd times (at last count on Amazon)? Let me start by asking why we are stuck with this bare bones DVD edition when the German special edition release is 3 discs? It contains both the theatrical release and the Alan Smithee version as well as a third disc of bonus materials. Incidently, I find the Smithee cut interesting for the extra scenes but its so poorly edited that its no wonder Lynch refused to take credit for it. The worst part of that version for me (well, aside from that horribly heavy handed prologue; I love how the Spacing Guild building is clearly labeled &quot;THE SPACING GUILD,&quot; in big, bold, black letters as if people might get confused) is the music, which is completely different due to extra scenes. It sounds like they just put the CD of the soundtrack on and looped it continuously. Listen to it some time, there's no silent moment in that version.<br />Anyway, as I was going to say, I'm so torn by this movie because for all the things it does wrong, it does so many things right and even when it is wrong (weirding modules, for example), it still manages to be compelling. The look of this movie is so stunning that I can't help but drool over it every time I see it. The primary problem with this movie is that Lynch did not have the final cut. It always appeared to me that for all the strange trappings of the film, Lynch really understood what was important to the story.  Dune has a lot of great moments, but the problem is that they don't always seem to fit together well. To me, that's an indication of too many conflicting ideas at war in the editing room. I once read an interview with Lynch where he said Dune was the only film he made that he would want to go back and change, but that even if he had the opportunity he wouldn't be able to do it. This movie was pretty much taken away from Lynch during the editing process and as such he never had the opportunity to shoot theadditional footage he probably realized he needed in places. I truly believe that Lynch could have fixed the continuity problems of this movie if the studio would have let him actually finish the it.<br />This movie could warrant 5 stars for its production design alone, but, alas, its a little difficult to follow (understand is probably a better word, since the plot is rather simple, it's Herbert's concepts that are tough to grasp) so I can't hold it up quite that high. Still, Lynch brings Herbert's world to life in a way that probably no other living person could. Little of it looks anything like I envisioned it when I first read the book, but the images of that movie will stay with me forever. In an era of cinema where films try so hard to give audiences what they expect, Lynch's Dune is a vision from some dark corner of the imagination that no one expects and is impossible to ignore. Especially considering the time it was made, Dune should have been a landmark for not trying to look like a castoff Star Wars or Star Trek story. It can't possibly look dated because it's just so incredibly alien to begin with. <br />I feel like I'm in the minority for being someone who enjoyed both this adaptation and the Harrison mini-series. Some people seem to hate the Harrison version with a bloodlust. Obviously, it takes a few minor liberties with the book as well but I don't have a problem with that so long as it's true to the spirit of the book. Also, let's not criticize unfairly just because the Harrison version didn't have the monstrous budget of the Lynch version (monstrous by 1984 standards, anyway). I've always felt that the Harrison version feels more like a theatrical production than a movie and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Much like Lynch's version, it's just a little different from what you'd expect. Any Dune fan should have both.
B00007E8O5|5.0|I'm really confused...I _want_ to comment this album but I can't...I can only repeat what other(s) have said - the Wall of hard rock. There's only theoretical chance anyone could ever go behind that Wall...and that anyone can be only Jerry. Just listen this music. Listen.
0385504209|5.0|This book is a literary masterpiece. I enjoyed the way so many historical facts were woven in so smoothly throughout this mystery novel. This book is worth the time and money. It is truly a work of art itself and deserves to bear the name of the great Da Vinci. This book is hard to put down, so clear your weekend schedule!
B00004T9UF|5.0|This is one of Eminem's best CD's ever.  I hate the skits (though I'm not one for skits), I do love all his raps.  If you can't take a joke or are not a funny person, then don't buy this CD, most of his jokes are racial, homophobic, etc jokes.  Eminem is my favorite Rapper, the best songs on this CD are:<br />Kill You - Track 2 (extremely funny!)<br />Who Knew - Track 5<br />The Way I Am - Track 7<br />The Real Slim Shady - Track 8  (An original, who will ever forget his VMA (or was it MTV? Who cares..) Performance of this song!)<br />I'm Back - Track 10 (He's back and so are his raps.)<br />Marshall Mathers - Track 11 (This is by far one of my favorites..)<br />Drug Ballad - Track 13 (An alright song.)<br />Under The Influence - Track 17 (Another alright song, very funny chorus)<br />Criminal - Track 18 (Another one of my favorites, Criminal is very funny.)
B0000C6E4D|5.0|A beautiful album full of melody and emotion.  If you are a fan, you have to have it.  If not, this will make you one!
B00009TB5G|1.0|If you enjoy being hit on the head for 4 HOURS this movie is for you! Every plot point, every emotion, is BEATEN into your skull with super-close-ups &amp; sappy music which follows every gesture &amp; facial expression and sometimes every word, just so you won't miss the OBVIOUS points being made by the director. And just when you think they trust you...no, sorry, they're IN YOUR FACE drumming the same point home to you yet again.<br />Alas, this is how to make a popular epic - suck out all ambiguity, nuance and troubling thoughts/feelings and replace them with blubbering actors and sappy sentimentality. And be sure to HAMMER every single last idea into the audience constantly for the *entire* length of the film and have a character voice it at the end in case anyone missed it:<br />'The battle for Helm's Deep is over (in case you missed that)  the battle for Middle Earth has begun!!'<br />or my favorite:<br />'Have to believe WHAT?!?'<BR>'That THERE'S STILL SOME GOOD LEFT IN THE WORLD!!' This is punctuated with sappy music *and* THREE consecutive super-close-ups!!<br />That these films are compared to the epics of David Lean is criminal.
B0000DZEE3|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I think Live at Slane Castle is an incredible live DVD. It's just difficult for me, because the Red Hot Chili Peppers are on of my favorite bands... Unfortunately, this one pales in comparison, not due to the performance (which is excellent) but due to the song selection. The oldest songs they play (if you don't count a Ramones cover) are songs from \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik.\\" Where's \\"Fire?\\" Where's \\"Me and My Friends?\\" These and others are Chili Peppers classics, and should be included in place of mediocre at best current songs like \\"Don't Forget Me,\\" and \\"Venice Queen.\\" The other strange thing about this DVD is the lack of upbeat songs. They opened with \\"By the Way,\\" for Christ's sake. I'll end this review by saying that despite the mediocre at best set list, the show is captivating, and incredibly well played. It's excellent by the standard of live DVD's in general, but not great by the standard of RHCP DVDs.
B000089J0R|5.0|ive never heard their demo, but i have heard this cd. it is amazing all the way through! Id have to say that the best tracks are Valley of the Damned, Black Winter Night, Starfire, and Disciples of Babylon. Overall this is one of the best power metal cds ive heard, if not the best. and its amazing because this is their debut cd too! for a debut this is really good! id recomend this for fans of blind guardian and lost horizon
0385504209|3.0|Dan Brown's &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; has been claimed as a masterpiece.<br />&quot;Da Vinci's&quot; plot adds credibility to this hailing, however the writing style does not.  Brown's plot is incredible.  The symbology is amazing and the descriptions of architecture and art are impeccable.  The connections made throughout the book are mind-numbing and thought-provoking, including pagan symbology with Christian history.<br />Unfortunately, Dan Brown's character development is flawed.  The characters do not have much depth, feeling too flat and inhuman.  The most believable characteris the man who dies in the beginning of the book.  Here, Brown's use of plot twists and puzzles comes to life, lending credibility to the character who left clues while expecting his death.<br />Another shortcoming is in the suspense.  Brown creates it rather than letting it flow from the plot, writing passages such as &quot;the five words he would say would make her mouth drop.&quot;  It would be desirable to let the suspense come naturally rather than trying to create hooks and cliffhangers.<br />In all, the book is worth reading, and the ideology behind the plotline is stunning.  Though it might offend some, the rationale and research behind the ideas presented in novel form is worth looking at.  The connections of history and symbology are worth understanding even to the most unbelieving individual.<br />It is only Brown's character development and artificial suspense that lowers &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; to three stars.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Wow. Simply wow. This is a great show. Clever, funny, fantastic cast, stunning production values. But at least it looks as if there will be a movie. Rumors seem to suggest that everything is still up in the air, but this link seems to suggest a more positive future. [...]<BR>The article, although dating from September, says that Universal bought the rights and production is schedualed to begin this spring. Here's hoping. While the film will be accessable to those who haven't seen the show, that's still no excuse to miss this. This is in my opinion, Wheadon's best work yet.
B000002H48|5.0|The other reviewers are right...but, the best tune on this set is &quot;Power&quot; a collaboration of friends making great music. I had the original lp and now am getting the cd... I just love the harmonies here... don't miss this.
0060005688|5.0|Schwartz' excellent book, &quot;The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less&quot;, is fascinating to read.  I saw him on the MacNeil News Hour &amp; was really looking forward to this newly published book.  The book exceeded my expectations. Practical advice within a tantalizing read.  I couldn't put it down.  I highly recommend it to everyone.
0671027387|5.0|NASA has discovered a meteor imbedded in the ice of the arctic circle that contains the fossilized remains of an extraterrestrial life form.  This is good news for President Zach Herney and bad news for presidential hopeful, Senator Sedgewick Sexton.  Or is it?  Deception point layers deception over perception.  Many of the characters do complete 180's by the end of the book, blending science and politics.<br /> The primary character, Senator Sexton's daughter, Rachel Sedgewick is sent to the Arctic by the NRO (National Reconnaissance Office) to confirm NASA's discovery that will ensure her father is NOT propelled into the White House by his very anti-NASA rhetoric.  No fan of the Senator, Rachel has no compunctions doing so.  While there she meets Michael Tolland, a respected host of an oceanic television show.<br />Together Rachel and Michael learn that the discovery is a fraud and there are government entities willing to kill to protect their carefully orchestrated deception.  Thrills and twists abound.  Dan Brown's 2001 effort, precedes the #1 best-selling DAVINCI CODE, but DB is clearly at the top of this game in this tight, compelling thriller.<br />A great and worthwhile read.
B00003CXB4|5.0|I was around 7 o 8 when this movie came out, It was one of my favoright movies back then, but then I grew out of it and now at age 17, I buy the digital version off it and I love it again.<br />This truly is a great Digital version off the movie, the 2 disc Platinum set does not take at all away from the Lion King was - it just makes it even more bigger. <br />I watched this the other night and had forogt about what happens in the movie and watching it again it still makes me sad and happy, this movie truly gets to you.<br />The digital remake includes Elton Johns 2 songs from the movie and a horible disney all stars song with the wannabe pop star Hillary Duff. But with that being the only bad thing in the set. It also comes in an immaculate cover presentation and the disc set contains an african safari with timon and paumba.<br />The soind on this movie is great - it was like being at the cinema again watching it.<br />Overall I rate it 5 stars.
B00005JLR6|5.0|Just saw this film for the second time at the theater, and the metaphor that comes to mind is that of peeling an onion.  The first time I saw the film, the skin of the onion was removed.  After the first half of the film it started sinking in that this was no mere string of episodes about Irish immigrants in New York City.  It was clear from the first that there was good acting, and I expected only one of those European-style \\"slice of life\\" films, but I was delighted that the story actually built up a direction and a momentum and built to a truly impressive conclusion.  Shakily photographed opening scenes turned out to be a deliberate and very appropriate work of craftsmanship linked into the heart of the film.  The weirdly filmed sensual bedroom scene turned out NOT to have just been tossed in for its own sake, but rather was essesntial to set up symbols for the second half of the film.  Not every note of the film rings true, but in the second half, once the characters are established, we find elements of mysticism and heartbreak mixed with textures of wonder and grit.  I knew I had to go back and peel away another layer.  Upon a second viewing, the spiritual/religious references were revealed more clearly, and I was convinced that my emotional response had been no mere fluke of mood or of the actors alone, but that this is actually a work of art, carefully set up with multiple layers and levels of understanding.  Motifs and metaphors of blood, home, planets, aliens, angels, and place will be more carefully explored on my next viewing, for they all clearly have deliberate meaning.  Even the setting of the \\"Hell's Kitchen\\" neighborhood is significant, because the film's setting is staged as a kind of purgatory for all of its characters as their mundane world becomes repeatedly touched by transcendent observations and events, as they must all come to grips with the ways in which life and death touch each other.  This is an awesome film whose themes and emotions go well beyond what most films will even attempt, although the film repeatedly shows restraint to try to keep such portrayals from appearing over-the-top.  But the seeming restraint does not dampen its emotional impact.  For those who are comfortable with a sense of spirituality that does not stem from specific points of doctrine (indeed, for which doctrine could be seen as needlessly limiting an appreciation of experience... of reality) this is a film that can be considered authentically religious.  Religious NOT in some simple sense of simply saying \\"let us pray,\\" but in a real-life and complex, challenging way... in which the kingdom of heaven is within, in which God acts through people, and through imperfect people loaded with fears and doubts and pain but who must find ways to express hope and charity in spite of this.  This is a great movie...well worth repeated viewings as viewers explore its many nuances and challenges.  After all, when one sets about peeling onions, it has this way of making the eyes water up, and that sort of cleansing effect is what this film is really about.  The cleansing and watery eyes are no mere surface effect.  The cleansing is meant to go very deep.<br />Bravo!

B0000062GE|5.0|this album is one of the best industrial albums of all time. it is nearly perfect, second only to a couple of albums by nine inch nails, which really speaks for itself. this is industrial music at its best. if you like this you should definetly get there previously album \\"wither,blister,burn and peel\\". its a little drummier which i dig, and can tell they evolved with darkest days. i listen to both these cds on a regular basis. there latest album \\"stabbing westward\\" is a really great album its just alot softer, but as usual christopher halls voice and lyrics make up for all shortcomings. anyway, buy this album, i have, several times.

B00005JMCN|4.0|This telling of the Seabiscuit story captures a lot of the mythic power that made this odd little horse such a national passion during the Depression.  Some have expressed a problem with the way the story is told visually. They find it jumpy and have a hard time following some things.  But I liked it a lot.  I think the images used tell the several stories moving through this movie are selected and filmed very effectively.<br />The movie isn't an exact or historical document.  Certain events are elided and others left out.  Betting, a very important aspect of horse racing, is hardly mentioned.  This is really a poem that captures the heart of the story trying to pull out the timeless qualities that make the story of the little horse with the big heart so compelling.<br />The racing sequences are very effective and at times I was simply stunned at what I was seeing.  However it was done, it was supremely effective.<br />All of the principle roles were performed wonderfully.  Jeff Bridges and Tobey Maguire have a very touching relationship.  Valerie Mahaffey and Elizabeth Banks are very effective as the women in Charles Howard's (Jeff Bridge's) life.  Chris Cooper is amazing as the trainer, Tom Smith.  And William H. Macy functions as a Greek chorus and comic relief in the role of the announcer.  I don't know the name of the actress who plays Macy's girlfriend, but she quietly steals a couple of scenes as well.  I think that Michael O'Neill and Annie Corley were very touching as Red Pollard's (Tobey Maguire's) parents.  I wanted to see more of them and find out how they ended up.<br />We all need stories about overcoming obstacles and sticking with things even when they seem hopeless.  Some people find such stories saccharine.  For me, this is a very effective story that inspires without being oversweet.  I think it depends on your own sense of irony, I suppose.  But I don't see or hear this movie as a cynical telling of a sugary story to extract money from the rubes.

B000002NBY|5.0|After taking up guitar, my musical tastes stretched beyond contemporary music straight from the charts - and I discovered and fell in love with one of the greatest songwriters of our time, Paul Simon. His work with Art Garfunkel combined Simon's musical genius and songwriting brilliance with the voice of Garfunkel, and they shared a successful career. Recording with Art Garfunkel made him famous, but it wasn't untill he began his amazingly diversified solo career that he truly began to shine.<br />Among his works as a soloist, the album &quot;Graceland&quot; truly stands out from the rest. This album uses the South-African style music with classic Simon songwriting. And every track is as original and unique as the last. His songs can be though provoking and full of meaning, such as the opening track &quot;The Boy In The Bubble,&quot; light hearted and humorous, as in &quot;I Know What I Know,&quot; and &quot;You Can Call Me Al,&quot; or even as spiritual as &quot;Homeless.&quot; The various musical styles Simon assumes and the way that these styles flow from one to the other creates an interesting and enjoyable listening experience.  <br />This album is a must have for any Simon fan - the songwriting is still as brilliant, perhaps better, than it was in the Simon and Garfunkel days, and the South-African style music truly enables Simon to do what he does best - write some of the best music of our time.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Producer Jerry Bruckheimer has made some very good films in his career, including the powerful Black Hawk Down (which featured Josh Hartnett), and he may have intended 2001's Pearl Harbor to be among his best films. After all, Bruckheimer-produced films seem to be action- and explosion-packed dramas and/or adventure films. Of course, he had such directorial talents as Ridley and Tony Scott to helm such projects as Top Gun and Black Hawk Down, but Michael Bay is not in those brothers' league as a director, and Pearl Harbor fails as both a Titanic-wannabe and a 61st Anniversary tribute to the heroes -- living or dead -- of Dec. 7, 1941.<br />Not only does Braveheart screenwriter Randall Wallace (We Were Soldiers) attempt to use every hoary war movie-mixed-with-love story cliche imaginable, inluding the Two Inseparable Childhood Pals Who Fall For the Same Woman plot that pits Ben Affleck and Hartnett in a romantic tug-of-war over Kate Beckinsale, but he also limits the actual centerpiece of the movie -- the attack on Pearl Harbor on that \\"day of infamy\\" -- to 40 minutes....and goes on to depict the April 18, 1942 Doolitle Raid on Tokyo and other Japanese cities, with Affleck and Hartnett at the controls of a B-25 medium bomber.<br />I have no quarrel with the idea of framing a standard romance between fictional characters with true historical events.  Indeed, James Cameron did a good job with 1997's Titanic, and From Here to Eternity is a fine film set on Oahu during the months leading up to Dec. 7, 1941.  And had Bruckheimer, Wallace and Bay even attempted to strive for some modicum of historical accuracy while still focusing on the Affleck-Beckinsale-Hartnett triangle, maybe their movie would not have been as bad as it is.<br />For instance, the scenes showing Admiral Yamamoto (Mako) and his staff planning their attack look ridiculously as if filmed on a minimalist Kabuki stage.  The staff offices and ships' wardrooms where Genda, Fuchida, Watanabe, and Nagumo discussed \\"Operation Hawaii\\" are nowhere to be seen in this movie. Instead, the Japanese are often depicted in outdoorsy little parks with Rising Sun banners.<br />While Affleck and Hartnett's characters are established as first rate pilots, they have been trained to fly single engine fighters.  But when the USS Hornet launches the 16 B-25 medium bombers on their daring \\"30 Seconds Over Tokyo\\" raid, our two flyboy friends are at the controls of one of these twin-engine planes. Hmmm....Maybe they took a Berlitz Bomber Flying Course in Five Easy Lessons?<br />Most of the historical characters here are played by talented actors (Jon Voight, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Colm Feore) but their parts are basically glorified cameos.  The only historical figure who has more than two lines is James Doolitle, played here by Alec Baldwin, who has no charisma whatsoever left over from his early successes in Beetlejuice and The Hunt for Red October.<br />The attack on Pearl Harbor is also problematic.  Bay has his Industrial Light and Magic CGI Japanese planes attacking the ships almost at random, with torpedo bombers striking the battleships well into the raid. Messrs. Wallace and Bay should go back to college and read Walter Lord's Day of Infamy or Gordon Prange's Dec. 7, 1941, where the authors explain that the torpedo planes were the first to strike. Had they come in willy nilly as in this movie, the smoke from the already bombed ships and airfields would have made their runs nearly impossible.<br />And, although the battleships recreated here look like their 1941 counterparts, why do those destroyers look suspiciously like 1990s vintage Arleigh Burke class tin cans? Because, by golly, that's what they are!  (One of those guided missile destroyers could have shot down most of the first wave of attackers by itself!)<br />Worse still, Pearl Harbor attempts to wring tears from its audience by showing dead nurses after the raid.  Yes, it's a powerful little fiction, but that's what it is, fiction.  Dishonest fiction, at that. It was bad enough to have lost 2,403 Americans on that terrible Sunday morning; couldn't the filmmakers avoid the temptation to tweak reality further and not add myths to the Pearl Harbor story? No, not in this sorry movie.ction.  Dishonest fiction, at that.

B000063UR2|3.0|I have seen the original theatrical version of this film before, back in high school. It was pretty good then, but it seems dated now.<br />I found the director's cut almost pointless.  It is good on a few points though. First, the score is good, but missing the lightheartedness of the original version and didn't really match up with the action.  The pacing is slowed down a little which in the original, was much too fast, with very little time devoted to critical plot points in the film.  Near the end however, it was much too slow and took out the 'cliffhanger ending' which I enjoyed from the original.<br />What is particularly dated about the original film is the final song at the end.  Full of synthesized sounds, it really demonstrated the volatility of the 80's music scene. Nonetheless, Ridley Scott usually makes a beautiful films and this one is no exception.  Plus, the whole package looks nice in itself, with the clear plastic sleeves and artwork.
B00000JCOV|5.0|this album doesnt get near enough credit. it was and still is a revolutionary sound that has and will continue to influence heavy metal for years to come. it is hands down, one of the top 5 heavy metal albums of all time.  it definetly has a kind of rap influence but is still extremely hard and is blended very nicely. if you like non-contempory metal, invest in this, you wont be disappointed. ive owned like 3 copies of this album, its a MUST HAVE in my book.
0446677450|5.0|Rich Dad Poor Dad, by Robert Kiyosaki, is such a simple and easy to understand book that even I, a fifteen-year-old novice to the money-making world of assets, investments, and real estate - who has never read a book about such things in her life - completely understood everything in this book. Kiyosaki lays everything out in front of you and explains all of it, basically, in \\"kid terms.\\" I say \\"kid terms\\" because anyone could have understood it. He took a situation that often can be very complex, confusing, and frustrating to learn and understand, and made it fun, simple, and easy to comprehend - exactly what everyone is looking for when they want to learn something new, especially if that something will help generate extra income.<br />What I learned from Kiyosaki was how to be successful with the money you are already making and what to invest it in so that you have even more money coming in - money that you are not even working for!<br />Now I know the difference between an asset and a liability and even what they are! I know Robert Kiyosaki has many more books and I intend to read them sooner than later. I would recommend this book to anyone who is uncertain about what a balance sheet is and/or how it works. I would also recommend it to anyone who wants to be more knowledgeable about how money works and how to make more of it without actually having to work harder. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a great book for money-making beginners and for anyone who wants a simple, straightforward book about making money.<br />In addition to reading this book, I have also played the board game Kiyosaki created called, Cashflow. This game helped me to further understand his book and the concepts he explained. Without the experience I have of playing this game, I would not be as knowledgeable as to how to use a balance sheet and understand how everything on it is categorized.

0064471837|5.0|I love reading, and fantasy is my preferred genre, however all too often I'm dragged down by the feeling of 'sameness'.  Many such stories don't come to life and drag you in like this story does, even while it holds all the standard elements of fantasy.<br />I think my favorite thing about the world Nix creates is the barrier between the Old Kingdom and the 'New World', as I'll call it... where on one side of the world everything is technological and modern and magic (or the Charter) can't be tapped - and on the other it's an entirely different world with magic and mystery.  Truly an analogy that those who enjoy fantasy can appreciate in our own mundane world.<br />I also found this book a true page-turner.  It keeps the story interesting, without trying to be overly sophisticated - as many \\"adult\\" books do.  I'm 25 and find that many \\"young adult\\" books are far more interesting and compelling than the standards often found in the general Fantasy section.<br />(And thanks to Rowling for re-opening the Young Adult section to those of us who were, for a time, to embarrassed to be seen there... and to Nix's series to keep us coming back.)
B0000CDLA7|3.0|I read the reviews for this album and found one person bashing reviewers who related this album to Metallica.  He claimed that if one compares T.O.T to Metallica they &quot;dont get music.&quot;  Honestly, this album sounds so much like Metallica and Megadeth Dream Theater should get sued. I love Dream Theater, and I think this album is the way metal should sound.  I love all the bridges and harmonies that James Labrie eloquently executes with his vast vocal prowess.  But...come on, Yes I Am is so close to Enter Sandman.  Stream Of Consciousness is Orion.  Labrie replicates Hetfield (at the end of Yes I Am) and Dave Mustaine's weird talking/singing techniques in another song. Did Dream Theater dump Petrucci for Marty Friedman?  This album clearly is Dream Theater going back to their Metal roots but...come on, it's a little too close for comfort.
B00005ATQD|5.0|So who doesn't get it from this film? Tom thinks he's straight because of Scientology. More than anything, this film exhibits how our thought's about things distort our image about ourselves. It's no mystery that Tom and Nicole divorced after making this movie. Leave it to Stanley to sneak one in on Tom!
0385504209|2.0|Da Vinci Code is a book with only one thing going for it, its presentiation of certian theories of chrisitian history.  It does not have interesting characters, plot or settings.  It certainly does not have good writing.  I only give it two stars because unlike its predecessor, Angels and Demons, I was able to finish it.  If, like me, you've read all the same books as Dan Brown and are familiar with the theories, this book has nothing to offer.<br />His characters are shallow and any information on them is dropped in dead chunks of exposition.  His entire book takes place in 24 hours so the settings have no depth.  There is one particular scene in which a character is bound and prays for forgiveness, after which the authorial voice bashed its way in and declares that the prayer will be answered.  This sort of foreshadowing is reminscent of the worst of 1930's pulp writing and should have been caught and killed by any competent editor.  I mention it because he used the same technique in Angels and Demons (causing me to throw the book across the room).<br />His characters remind me of rejects from a James Bond movie.  Rejected for being too over the top to be realistic.  Although, in all fairness, I did get all the way through Da Vinci Code, which I was unable to do with Angels and Demons.<br />Please go read Douglas Preston and Lincoln Childs (Relic, Reliquary, Cabinet of Curiosities, Still Life with Crows) or F. Paul Wilson's Repairman Jack series.  (Tomb etc.)
B00008EYA5|2.0|When I picked up S.W.A.T. at my local blockbuster this morning I obviously wasn't expecting a perfect film - I more or less just wanted an easy way to be entertained for 2 hours. I unfortunetly wasn't even really entertained. <br />S.W.A.T. is plagued with problems from the start. The film is chock full of plot holes and gaps, it's filled with characters you know extremely little about and to be honest, the action is that intense. There's nothing here we haven't sen a million times before, and there's really no unbelievable directing flare to speak of either. <br />There are some talented actors in this one, but it feels like they're just riding the wave through it. Also, there's plenty of corny cop lines in the dialogue and some cheesy music to boot. <br />Overall, there's really little to like in this one. A couple good one liners and a decent explosion or two, but that's about it. <br />Film: D+
B000089CPF|5.0|This album is my introduction to Calexico. I heard Quattro on Internet radio and was intrigued enough to buy the CD--smart move. I have such eclectic tastes in music, it's hard to find a band whose overall effort is so satisfying. I played it three times in row after ripping off the shrink-wrap.  Needless to say, the other albums are soon heading my way.

B00005ALRO|5.0|If you have somehow missed seeing this terrific action film with Harrison Ford and the inimitable Tommy Lee Jones (he won an Oscar for this role), then waste no time and see it now. It's a terrific update of the popular 1960s TV series of the same name, based on the real-life story of a surgeon wrongly accused of murdering his wife. In one of the most sensational action sequences ever filmed, Ford escapes from a the scene of a horrible wreckage (bus vs. train) as he is enroute in the bus to prison. <BR>And off he goes, dodging the law (Jones) at every twist and turn, to find the real killer on his own. <BR>Not only is it a great action thriller, however; it's also an intense and spellbinding character study, well-suited to the personalities of the two stars who play so well the roles of hunter and hunted. They come, of course, to have a mutual respect for each other.<BR>Watch it now.
0790730960|5.0|Far superior to its predecessor, this film had it all. Top notch acting, good writing, action, humor and darkness! Michelle Pfeiffer made living history as Catwoman. She took a well known character and made it all her own. Unfortunately the severely untalented Halle Berry has now taken over the Catwoman legacy so it is inevitable let-down. Well at least we will always have Michelle in black vinyl with a bull whip making men pay for their oppressive &amp; misogynistic ways.

B0000026DJ|5.0|DIESEL &amp; DUST remains an album that sounds as vital and current now as it did when it was released 16 years ago. Even taking into consideration that the issues the band sang about back then---aboriginal rights and justice, ecological destruction, imperialism---haven't really changed much, the album really soars on Midnight Oils' crack musicianship, the great songs, the equally great production and Peter Garrett's weird, intense vocals. It's not a pretty voice, but it's memorable and it holds you like a cobra's gaze. First among equals for songs is &quot;The Dead Heart,&quot; with it's powerful evocation of aboriginal perspectives on their lot in Australia.<br />Midnight Oil has never been quite as appreciated worldwide as they have within Australia, but their music and their recordings singly and together testify to one of the best bands that ever existed. And DIESEL &amp; DUST belongs in any collection of anybody who's ever given a damn about changing the world.
B00003CXFV|5.0|It's my sister who's the REAL fan, and while staying at her house for 3 days last summer, I 'got' to watch this movie 5 times, so I think I can speak from some experience when saying I enjoyed it anew each time. Plus: I've seen it twice on cross-country plane trips, once in the local theater, and once on home video. Lordy!<BR>Anyway...<BR>This fact-based movie earned Julia Roberts an Oscar, deservedly. It captured her ability for slapstick, pathos, drama, etc. Twice-divorced and flat broke Brokovich forces her way into a job in the office of a lawyer who failed to win her a big award in a traffic accident injury case, then goes on to make herself indispensible in the investigation of toxic chromium contamination of the groundwater of little no-place, no-count Hinkley, California, where locals have suffered a plague of pain, death and disease. With her common-folk ways, she succeeds in winning the confidence of 100% of the distrustful and jaded populance - and a huge award in a personal injury case against big business.<BR>5 stars for the movie, 5 stars for Brokovich and J. Roberts, 5 stars for the little guys of the world who triumph against the big bucks of corporate arrogance.
B00005JMCN|5.0|&quot;Seabiscuit&quot; is one of the best film releases of 2003.  It stars Tobey McGuire, Jeff Bridges, William H. Macy, Chris Cooper, and more.  This film explores the true story of a man determined to follow his dream of being a horse racer.  The writers brilliantly combine that with two other stories: a man whose business is hurting because of The Great Depression and a man determined to save the horses from slaughtering.  Such added substance keeps the audience interested.  The emotional aspect of the plot is wonderfully expressed through the words and the events.  It wonderfully keeps this film unique rather than the average horse racing movie.  <br />The actors follow the emotional value brilliantly.  Whether they express pain, anger, happiness, determination, or sadness, they always perform at their finest.  Tobey McGuire and Jeff Bridges capitalize this.  McGuire takes his career to new and better levels with his demanding role as the determined horse racer.  His character's painful childhood is never held back with his reactions to everything in life.  Bridges behavior roles express his character's turbulent times perfectly.  This is his best role in years.  Chris Cooper's acting quality in this movie lives up to his Oscar winning role in &quot;Adaptation&quot;.  His character's love for animals is obvious thanks to him.<br />The set-up construction and the costume designs are accurate to the American early 1900's style.  Obviously, the artists researched this time period thoroughly.  Even the character's make-up is flawless.  The months spent perfecting every detail paid off.<br />&quot;Seabiscuit&quot; is a great movie for those looking for something great and inspiring.  This is sure to please many audiences for a long time.  Some may have to watch it more than once to fully understand all the details, but in the end, many will be glad once they did.

B000002MFN|5.0|This is one of my favorite Madonna albums, and her most misunderstood. I guess it's hard to take an album seriously when its called EROTICA, especially since the subject matter is not about sex, only on a handful of songs. While I'm not a huge fan of the Shep Pettibone tracks, her work with Andre Bette is among some of her best work, and those songs really standout. The title track and \\"Where Life Begins\\" are the most sexually explicit songs, but they have a certain camp value (at least to me). She does a decent cover of the song \\"Fever\\". \\"Rain\\" is one of her best ballads of her career. The album drags a little at the end with \\"Why's It So Hard\\" and \\"In This Life\\", nice sentiments but overall not too impressive, more boring than anything. \\"Did You Do It\\" is a waste of time, plain and simple. However, at the end is \\"Secret Garden\\", which is one of the best songs on here! Other highlights include \\"Deeper and Deeper\\", \\"Words\\", \\"Waiting\\", and more.
B000002N3J|5.0|In 1995, Madonna released her tenth album entitled, SOMETHING TO REMEMBER. It turns out that this album is Madonna's first-ever greatest ballads compilation, featuring fourteen of Madonna's greatest ballads. Some of the songs are old and were released as singles. Others are old, but were never released as singles and never will be. Some are new and were released as singles, but all of these songs are from Madonna's creativity and heart. <br /> <br />I WANT YOU (with Massive Attack) <br />  New song. This song was originally recorded by Marvin Gaye, and frankly, Madonna's version is worth listening to, while Marvin Gaye's recording makes me want to puke. Now, this song was never released as a single, but for some reason, Madonna shot a music video for it. Don't ask me why that was to be. <br /> <br />I'LL REMEMBER <br />  From the original motion picture & motion picture soundtrack \\"With Honors\\" (1994). This beautiful song was released as single for the film, \\"With Honors\\", starring Brendan Frasier and Joe Pesci. A beautiful song. <br /> <br />TAKE A BOW <br />  From the album BEDTIME STORIES (1994). A beautiful song that became Madonna's biggest-selling single, where it became Madonna's eleventh #1 (Billboard Hot 100) for seven straight weeks. A beautiful and heartfelt song. <br /> <br />YOU'LL SEE <br />  New song. The first single from the album. This is another one of Madonna's beautiful ballads. I remember that this song was the second song I had heard from Madonna back in 1996. Beautiful song. <br /> <br />CRAZY FOR YOU <br />  From the original motion picture & motion picture soundtrack \\"Vision Quest\\" (1985). Madonna's second #1 (Billboard Hot 100) hit single. This is one of the best songs in Madonna's career. Madonna even had a cameo appearence in \\"Vision Quest\\" as a lounge singer. I really enjoyed seeing Madonna live in concert on her RE-INVENTION TOUR, where she performed this song. She even said at the start of the song that, \\"...This next song goes out to my fans, who stuck by through thick and motherf***ing thin for the last 20 years...\\" <br /> <br />THIS USED TO BE MY PLAYGROUND <br />  From the original motion picture \\"A League Of Their Own\\" (1992). This was Madonna's tenth #1 hit single, and it was the main theme for the 1992 factual-based comedy, \\"A League Of Their Own\\", where Madonna even had a supporting role in the film as Mae Mordabito (or as her teammates called her, \\"All The Way\\" Mae). This is one of my favorite Madonna songs. <br /> <br />LIVE TO TELL <br />  From the album TRUE BLUE (1986). This was Madonna's third #1 hit single, as well as being the theme song to Sean Penn's 1986 action drama film, \\"At Close Range\\". A beautiful song. Madonna has performed this song on her CONFESSIONS TOUR, while hung up on a Disco-like cross, while she is wearing a red Jesus-like blouse, black tight pants, black boots, and she wears a crown of thorns in her hair. <br /> <br />LOVE DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE (Remix) <br />  Original version from the album LIKE A VIRGIN (1984). \\"Remix\\": The second single from the album. When Madonna included the original version of this song on her 1984 album, LIKE A VIRGIN, she did not release the song as a single. This remix is the version that Madonna had decided to release as a single. A great remix, but the video version is much better. <br /> <br />SOMETHING TO REMEMBER <br />  From the album I'M BREATHLESS (1990). This here title track was originally released on Madonna's album, I'M BREATHLESS. This is a great song, but it was never and never will be released as a single. <br /> <br />FORBIDDEN LOVE <br />  From the album BEDTIME STORIES (1994). A great song from the BEDTIME STORIES album, but it was never and never will be released as a single. <br /> <br />ONE MORE CHANCE <br />  New song. The third & final single from the album. This song (Non-U.S. single), is not a favorite of mine. It is one the very few Madonna songs that I do not like. <br /> <br />RAIN <br />  From the album EROTICA (1992). One of Madonna's prettiest songs, which is about her mother and the late Karen Carpenter. I wish this single would have been a major hit. <br /> <br />OH FATHER <br />  From the album LIKE A PRAYER (1989). Another one of Madonna's heartfelt ballads. This song should have been a bigger hit. A beautiful song. <br /> <br />I WANT YOU (Orchestral) (with Massive Attack) <br />  New song. Although this version is very good, I think the album version is much better. <br /> <br />    This is a brilliant album, and I feel that all Madonna fans should have it, even they do not like it. It is still a great album to have in your Madonna collection. One of the things I really liked about this album is what Madonna said in her THANK YOU's. Here is what she said: \\"...So much controversy has swirled around my career this past decade, that very little attention ever gets paid to my music. The songs are all but forgotten. While I have no regrets regarding the choices I've mad artistically, I've learned to appreciate the idea of doing things in a simpler way. So without a lot of fanfare, without any distractions, I present to you this collection of ballads. Some are old, some are new, all of them are from my heart...\\"

B00004X01U|3.0|On 2000's MUSIC album, we find Madonna in a partying mood. Working with french producer Mirwais, the album has a funky dance sound that sounds like it was lifted from Daft Punk. There's a few acoustic, reflective tracks as well. The title track shot to #1, her first since 1994's \\"Take A Bow\\". The video was outrageous, as the one for \\"What It Feels Like For A Girl\\" was too. \\"Impressive Instant\\" is a great song that Madonna wanted released as a single, but the record company wanted to release \\"Amazing\\" instead (which sounds an awful lot like her 1999 song \\"Beautiful Stranger\\"). Everyone seems to love \\"Don't Tell Me\\", but I wasn't too impressed with it. \\"Paradise (Not For Me)\\" and \\"I Deserve It\\" are two of my favorites here. \\"Runaway Lover\\" is not really a good song to be truthful, and I have never really cared for it. It's a pretty good album, not her best, but it's fun.
6304806426|5.0|Wow. Rarely does a movie reach so daringly for the heights and attain the top as The English Patient does. Set during World War II, it's a novel about love and loss, juxtaposing the doomed past love for a married woman that the horribly burned English Patient in the past with the blossoming love, during the waning days of the war, that his nurse is developing for a bomb defuser (talk about a dangerous occupation!) Told in ethereal flashbacks as remembered through a morphine haze, the story comes together in misty bits and pieces that weave themselves into a gossamer curtain that's laid over the whole tale. Comic relief is provided by Caravaggio (!), a thumbless thief.<BR>Top rating, for sure.
B00009TB5G|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever made. It has action, romance, action, magic, action..........well, you get the point. Peter Jackson managed to pull off the impossible and make a wonderful trilogy of the wonderful books by J.R.R. Tolkien. The cinematography is wonderful, the acting is first-rate, the music is gorgeous; all in all, this is a masterpiece of moviemaking.<BR>Also, it is not too long. Those of you who think so clearly aren't intelligent enough to understand what is going and are therefore bored.
B000002W9Q|5.0|I absolutely love this album.  I used the orchestral version of I've Had The Time Of My Life at my wedding.  It simply can set any mood.  I rate this CD 5 stars because it's something that everyone can listen to.  Dirty Dancing is something that is here to stay for an extremely long time!
B000002LGQ|5.0|This is Madonna's best album from the 80s. It opens with the title track, which is a classic Madonna, and one of her biggest hits. &quot;Express Yourself&quot; also earns that honor of distinctive songs you think of when you think of Madonna. She collaborates with Prince on the funky &quot;Love Song&quot;. LIKE A PRAYER has some of her best ballads, like the ode to her mother on &quot;Promise To Try&quot;, or the excellent &quot;Spanish Eyes&quot;. There's some nice uptempos like &quot;Keep It Together&quot; and &quot;Til Death Do Us Part&quot;. This is definately one of her best albums of her career. &quot;Oh Father&quot; is a great ballad and truly sad. The singles from this album include the title track, &quot;Express Yourself&quot;, &quot;Keep It Together&quot;, &quot;Cherish&quot;, &quot;Oh Father&quot; and &quot;Dear Jessie&quot; in some countries. A must have for any music collection.
0374172897|5.0|...and I'm almost never the ga-ga type. But The Hours took my breath away with its complexity, its interweaving of plots and time frames and the involvement of V. Woolf's (her writing and her own story) - all brought to modern times in twists and turns of writing that just, well, made me ga-ga, completely entranced. Several story lines are interwoven: Mrs. Dalloway (the book and its characters), Virginia Woolf's own life, the story of Laura Brown, a depressed and suicidal 1950's housewife, and Clarissa Vaughan's preparations for a party for her dying gay friend, who has nicknamed her Mrs. Dalloway. <BR>Reading The Hours sent me on a quest to understand more about Virginia Woolf. I'd read Mrs. Dalloway years ago and found it hard going. But this time I read it slowly, savoring the long interior passages. And I've seen the movie. And I've read Quentin Bell's (Woolf's nephew) books about her and the whole Bloomsbury Set. I can't get enough and keep digging deeper and deeper.<BR>Cunningham has spawned a whole new genre with this stellar piece of writing.
B00005JLEU|4.0|When I see al the negative reviews, I wonder what is it that people dislike about it so much? They say &quot;confusing and bizarre plot.&quot; Well, you want a confusing plot, go see Memento!(meant positively)Huh, go figure.<br />Spirited Away is the latest installment by Hayao Miyazaki, master of anime. Seeing this really gave me the idea of what animation was supposed to be. Unlike recent failures, such as Treasure Planet and a lot of stuff by Disney, it had a spark that really pulled you in without anything but pure charm and intrigue. The lead, Chihiro, is somewhat whiny and a brat, but that all fits in. Characters fit in perfectly with their role, some selfish, some kind, and so on. <br />The actual animation was a show of talent by Studio Ghibli, as most of the movie, I sat thinking, &quot;Wow. This beats computer animation any day.&quot; The amazing artwork and beautiful animations all add to the unique flavor. Just amazing.<br />Now for the bad part. I originally saw Spirited Away in Japanese, so I could not rate the voice acting. (being not-Japanese) When I saw the American version with Daveigh Chase, I was appalled to see the voice and words butchered by Disney. (surprise, surprise) Very disappointing.<br />Overall, Spirited Away is a magical movie worth seeing... and seeing... and eventually buying. A true masterpiece... and who says all animation is just for little kids.

B00000DCHI|5.0|From the humble start that he had, I must admit the BILLY JOEL has become one (if not the only one) of the best musical talents to date.<br />Being in the early part of my 30's now, I think back and wonder &quot;Has it been that long!!!!&quot; since the first time I heard &quot;An Innocent Man&quot;... The Song, Lyrics &amp; The Man have developted so much... CAN HE GET ANY BETTER...<br />I leave it to you to decide.
020530902X|5.0|As the 'rules' in this iconic book take up only 14 pages, it continually amazes me how often I can find the answer to a grammar or punctuation guestion within those pages. It doesn't cover everything, and some of the 'rules' are of course changing with the passage of time - but if a wannabe writer can't afford a whole bookcase of tomes on How to Write, then this is the one he or she should buy.<br />Beyond those 14 pithy pages, however, are another 100 or so that extend the value of the book immeasurably: Principles of Composition, Commonly Misused Words, and perhaps the most valuable: An Approach to Style, which gives excellent advice along the lines of Do not overwrite, Avoid qualifiers, Don't over-explain, Avoid adverbs, Avoid dialect, Don't inject opinion, and tons of others.<br />When all's said and done, however, one of the very best parts is a wonderful essay by the inimitable EB White himself - the Introduction, which serves as a perfect example of all that the rest of the small book preaches: write concisely, clearly, and well, and say something worthwhile.<br />Other books for writers to consider: Bird by Bird, On Writing, and Writing Down the Bones.

B00013F38K|1.0|Any prospective purchasers of this DVD, please note that the orignal series was filmed and broadcast in a 4:3 screen ratio.  To accomodate the 16:9 ratio of widescreen TVs, the image will be cropped, losing image (about 25%) from the top and/or bottom of the screen.  If the series were presented in its correct 4:3 ratio, there would be black or gray bars at the right and left of the widescreen TVs ... Warner is probably trying to avoid complaints from viewers who don't realize that this is the only way to correctly present the original image as filmed and broadcast.  Warner's would better serve fans of the series by presenting it as originally filmed and broadcast and educating its customers that this is the correct presentation.<br />Prospective buyers of this DVD need to realize that they will be seeing about 25% less image than was originally filmed and broadcast.

0395389496|5.0|Gorgeous illustrations.<br />Amazingly mesmerizing language, almost poetry.<br />Magical story about Santa's visit on Christmas Eve. Santa, however, arrives on a train instead of a sleigh, and he takes the boy on a train ride to the North Pole (a trip that is so exquisitely illustrated that you can come to believe it's real), where, from among hundreds, he's chosen to receive the first Christmas present, which he can choose. He could choose anything, anything at all - and he chooses one of the bells from Santa's sleigh, which is loaded, ready and waiting.<br />When he returns home and the train pulls away, he's devastated to discover the bell has fallen through a hole in his pocket. What happens next to restore this child's believe in Christmas magic.<br />Buy the book and find out. Buy it. But it now and read it yearly at Christmas. When your kids grow up and leave home, read it to yourself. Then read it to grandchildren. Take it to your retirement community and keep reading it.<br />For sure.
B00005V9HH|2.0|I used to love this movie.  The film's often mentioned final twist seems so devilishly clever the first time you see it.  Then you think about it for a while and you realize how this formulaic whodunit never gave you a chance.<br /><br />The entire allure of mystery stories for the viewer is to of course try figure them out before the story itself reveals the truth.  As a writer, the trick is to present all the evidence to the viewer in a passing, seemingly inconsequential fashion usually out of order and with twists that throw him or her off and then tie everything up at the finish.  The tease is that everything or at least enough information is presented before you find out the truth.<br /><br />This film does not do that.  Basically, this film lies to you for two hours and pretends to pull the rabbit out of the hat at the end as if you had been standing in the same room in which the trick was performed.  Instead of clarifying, the final scene raises more questions than it answers assuming the only question you care about is the idenity of Soze.<br /><br />As infuriating as this is, the characters are somewhat fun to watch.  All five usual suspects are characters that have appeared in dozens of streetwise mysteries before but their interaction with one another is appealing.  Del Toro has some great lines as Fenster, (\\"He'll flip ya, flip ya fo' real\\" is a fav of mine) and most of the perforances are well done.  Spacey is of course great and this is my favorite role for Chazz P since A Bronx Tale.  Otherwise, this is a movie that revisits used themes like the internal conflict between good and evil and the mythology of criminal underworlds and since everything is a lie the questions your left with devalue the one truth revealed.
B000067F7Q|5.0|In my humble opinion, this is the best Arch Enemy album. There's just something about Johan Liiva's voice that Angela Gossow can't match. Also, the guitar work is incredible- the solos and such are very unique-sounding and they contrast the darker feel of the songs perfectly. It's like there's a perfect balance created that no one else can match :). If you want a good Arch Enemy cd, this is the one to buy. Arch Enemy's biggest mistake was getting rid of Johan Liiva, but not to worry- this album will always sport his magnificent vocals.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|This album easily equals their stunning debut. The greatest mistake Savage Garden could have made would be to have made a carbon copy of their last album. They definitely did not do that. This album's mood is much mellower. This is a result of Darren Haye's divorce. Songs such as &quot;The Lover after me&quot;, &quot;I don't know you anymore&quot;, the classic &quot;I Knew I loved you&quot; and &quot;You can still be free&quot; are absolutely fantastic. However, you lovers of pop do not despair. There are many pop gems on this album. &quot;The Best Thing&quot; keeps me rocking, &quot;Affirmation&quot; is reminiscent of &quot;I want you&quot; and has number one written all over it. &quot;Chained to you&quot; is another great europop track. &quot;Crash and Burn&quot; is wonderfully directed. &quot;The Animal Song&quot; is the epitome of pop excellence. What else can I say! BUY IT!
078322737X|5.0|How many times have you seen this movie? It just never gets tired, and the older I get, the more fun it is to watch it and realize how very many of the young then-unknowns have gone on to stupendously successful careers. I mean, George Lucas, Ron Howard, Harrison Ford (without the Indy hat, but the sneer is already present), Richard Dreyfus, Wolfman Jack, of course, and the list goes on and on...<BR>It's so true to small town life in the early 60s, teenagers just having graduated from high school and about to take their first step into adulthood. The whole movie takes place during one hot summer night and manages to capture the look, cars, feel, morals, music, and hopes of that era. This collector's edition DVD includes a long and wonderful commentary by Lucas with interviews of some of the actors, behind-the-scenes production notes. <BR>Tops. One to own - and watch it again with your kids when they ask you what it was like &quot;back in the olden days.&quot;
B000002IJA|2.0|It is an overall good album, but where is Bon Scott?  In my opinion a greatest hits album would have:<br />Hells Bells<br />T.N.T.<br />Back In Black<br />Shoot to Thrill<br />Shook Me All Night Long<br />Highway To Hell<br />Girls Got Rythm<br />And don't think that is all, but those would be a must on a greatest hits.  I do not suggest getting this album, I say get  all the albums instead, but it is NOT a bad album just doesn't have the best on it!
B000002H6C|5.0|This is the album where James really found his voice and where Metallica's song writing matured and became more thematically sophisticated. All of this while still maintaining the raw energy and emotion of their previous albums! For example, listen to the album's last track, &quot;Dyer's Eve&quot;-- James' voice has so much power and emotion, the lyrics are powerful, and the playing is awesome. <br />Anyone who thinks that Justice cannot hold a candle to Lightning or Puppets, needs to go back and really listen to Justice. I used to feel this way too, but now that I am in my 30s, Justice stands as Metallica's pinnacle for me because of its sophistication and endurance.
B00005B4GU|1.0|okay, Kid A was kinda cool, but then this? I know people like this CD, but I feel justified in giving it a 1. Why, you ask? There is not one song (and I've givin it plenty of chances) that I like or even find interesting. My theory: these guys have got themselves so caved up in their own little world they've forgotten how to make music that doesnt just please themselves. Hey, I listen to some pretty outrageous stuff (melt-banana, Ween, Alien Sex Fiend) but this isn't expiremental in a good way, it's only exposing this band's out-of-touch state, and, well, I don't really think Im doing anything but wasting my time telling a bunch of people I'll never know how I feel. BUY IT! IT's RADIOHEAD! THEY CAN DO NO WRONG!
B00003CWN3|5.0|This is the movie that really put Hilary Swank on the map. She plays Brandon Teena, a cute and innocent-looking teenager who is befriended by a bunch of rednecks and starts living the life he's always hoped to live. There's hell to pay when it's discovered that Brandon is really a girl, dealing with sexuality issues that have plagued his entire life. <BR>Based on the 1993 real-life story of Teena Brandon, this movie went over the top in terms of popularity, primarily because of Swank's unsentimental performance that brought Brandon's conflicts and passions heartbreaking to life. It's hard to imagine using the word \\"sweet\\" to describe a movie as agonizing and sad as this one it, but there you have it - and most people will feel nothing but respect for Brandon as the closing credits roll.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|I've been a fan of comic book heroes and herorines since I was old enough to read and Kate Beckinsale's character was the classic comic book heroine.  I don't mean that in a demeaning way.  I rate her character right along side that of Ellen Ripley \\"Alien(s)\\" etc, and that is high praise for a first outing in strong action heroes. Ms Beckinsale is strong, sexy, smart and wow, what an outfit.  She also give a classic style gothic character portrayal of a woman not to be babied or toyed with.  The concept was fresh also.  In a world of two evil titans I felt sorry for the Lycans and the end sequence gave a grim situation a spark of hope as well as a great setup for a sequel.  Speedman was an incredible portrait of a combination Lycan/Vampire that was powerful, sleek and handsome.  The special effects and makeup departments worked over-time on this one and it showed.  Instead of a lot of CGI creatures, I was very excited by the return to the human influence in the creatures.  The suits and animatronics added a 3-D effect that sold me on this movie.  This just might be the best of this type movie that I have ever seen.  As good a Spiderman, better than the \\"Hulk\\".  Destined to become a cult classic!!!  Get your copy now!
B000089RVX|4.0|Well this album was kind of a suprise to me. It's not the sort of music we have never heard before, that's for sure. But it is very clear these four people did the best they could to make the best music in this genre. It's somewhat on the gothic metal side but it's also a bit of heavy metal. Some people in the reviews tried to compare it to bands like Poison or Anthrax, but that is comparison that doesn't fit. If you want to compare it to some band it's better to compare them with After Forever,Autum, Within Temptation and add some Nightwish. This is the cd you have to buy if you are either new in the metal or gothic metal scene and not ready for the more heavy stuff, or you are someone who loves melodic metal and want some metal stuff to relax with. My personal favorites are My Immortal, My last breath and Going Under.
B0000BWVCM|4.0|Being a sci-fi fan since the original episodes of Star Trek aired in the late sixties, X2 takes the sci-fi action movie to a new level and leaves you wanting more.  The addition of a female villian with abilities similar to Wolverine was a great addition to the appeal of this sequel.  The special effects and action sequences are top notch.
0671004107|5.0|If you haven't yet read this novel by Carl Sagan, then immediately PUT DOWN what you are doing and start reading one of the greatest books I've ever read.  In any case, you have probably seen the movie, which I thought was ok, but the book provides a much deeper and important experience.  Let me just go through a few of the reasons I enjoyed this book so much.<br />First, any book worth reading should be both entertaining and thought provoking, and hopefully at the end it will have changed or added to how you think about the universe and your life.  Well, this book is undoubtably entertaining and is hard to put down, but more importantly there is much to learn and ruminate over within.  Whether there is intelligent life out there in the universe is one of the most important unanswered questions left for humanity.  Here Sagan explores the implications of finding an intelligent message: how it unites humanity for a common cause and how it changes our view of our place in the universe.  On another level, Sagan's book is about one person's quest for meaning.  Ellie Arroway travels across the galaxy to find answers, but in the end she finds even more surprising revelations from her step-father back on earth.  On yet another level, there is the issue of religion in our society.  The characters are very rich in Contact, and each voices their unique opinion on these issues.  Here is a book that can be read many times over with new insights each time.<br />Some highlights of this book are the great writing and dialogue as well as the depth of the characters - a rarity in a SF novel.  Also, the science is very well presented.  In particular, the chapter on Hadden's final departure is near perfect.  Sagan also included many future predictions for 1999 and many of them hit quite close to home.<br />There are a few downsides as well, but they don't really detract from the overall experience.  One is Sagan's prediction of the continuing Cold War gets a little tiresome.  Another is why would Hadden (who helped decipher the primer) choose to leave for space rather than waiting to see what happened to the crew?  If he was really looking for immortality, wouldn't he be curious to see what the aliens had said?<br />Finally it is interesting to realize that 1999 has come and gone and there has been no messages received by SETI.  What would the implications be of Earth being the only planet in the universe with intelligent life?  I recommend this great article if you are interested in reading more about this topic: [...]<br />Go read Contact!
630522577X|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. I'm 29 years old, and I don't like musicals. But I found myself singing along with Audry like a kid singing along watching Sesame Street. For those who don't like musicals, don't worry. This movie has musical parts only in areas that fits perfectly with its flow. Also, Audry is superb and adorable.
0393316041|5.0|It was a pleasure to read these collected stories from Feynman's life.  Each story is entertaining and often humorous or enlightening.  Most remarkable I think is how honest these stories are.  Feynman includes some very strange stories - particularly one about him hanging out in Vegas and trying to pick up women - that seem a bit out of place.  But I think that is part of the appeal of this book: it is a very honest look at Feynman's rich life.<br />In a way, Feynman reminds me of the title character from Oliver Sack's \\"An Anthropologist on Mars\\" about an autistic woman who describes herself as continuously observing human behavior like an anthropologist on Mars.  Feynman is constantly trying to do experiments to see how other people respond, including many enjoyable practical jokes.  Maybe humans were sort of like physics for him, and he was just trying to perturb the system and see how they worked.<br />The real message I got out of these stories was how Feynman was so willing to try everything - particularly the things he was not very good at.  He's a bad artist, so he decides to learn how to draw and ends up getting his own art show.  He's not very musical, so he learns to play drums and ends up recording the music for a ballet.  He doesn't know any biology, so he starts learning and ends up doing experiments with JD Watson.  In one section he delves into Mayan history and starts deciphering the codecs.  In another memorable chapter he learns the art of safecracking while at Los Alamos.  This book sort of inspires me to try something I stink at and see how much I can accomplish.  For Feynman, it seems like there was nothing he couldn't do.<br />Overall I think you will be glad if you get this book.  However, I also got the book \\"The Pleasure of Finding Things Out\\" and that was not as enjoyable.  It was more of a collection of lectures he gave and was less personal.  There was also considerable overlap in the stories.  <br />My only real complaint is that therewas not enough science in the stories, but there are plenty of other books by Feynman for that (QED and Six Easy Pieces among others).  So if you haven't been introduced to Dick Feynman's writing, do yourself a favor and get \\"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!\\"
B0000DZEA1|4.0|I am a huge fan of Howard Shore and his previous Lord of the Rings soundtracks.  However, of the three, this one is my least favorite.  The power of the previous two is simply not present in the third one.  The violin of Rohan that I love is barely heard and most of the pieces, with the definate exception of Minas Morgul, are quiet background pieces.  Please don't get me wrong, this is an excellent CD and I am especially pleased that it has Billy Boyd and Viggo Mortensen singing (I love Billy Boyd's song).  I recommend buying the CD but it is not as good as the first two.

B0000E1WKE|5.0|For those of you who think that Whitney cannot sing anymore...this album PROVES that you are so very wrong. She does not do crack and has NEVER been arrested. She has sold an astonishing 120 Million Records world-wide and is an amazing Live performer! She is quite an amazing woman. <br />The songs on this album are so beautifully  arranged. As someone else said, this is probably the best Christmas Album of this year...compared to others like Harry's and Hillary Duff (someone who REALLY cant sing lol!) A MUST-BUY FOR THE HOLIDAYS!
B00005JKC3|3.0|I watched this movie 1 time &amp; I was not impressed with the pace of the movie. I enjoyed about the last 30 to 35 min of complete action. If you are a fan of the comics I guess you may enjoy this movie. I however enjoyed some of the helicopter scenes &amp; watch lots of stuff blow up near the end of the feature bout thats about it.
B00005JLK1|5.0|WELL, it's kind of \\"Titanic\\" meets \\"The Shining\\" 'an then sum ..... GREAT fun aboard this floating  'haunted monsoon' and plenty of nasty work afoot ...... a swimming pool that bleeds, spectral drinking scene along the lines of \\"The Shining's\\" ballroom .... a seductive torch-singer .... etc.  THEN there's THAT little girl lost ......<br />Plenty of plot twists and turns as the body count mounts ... leaving rather an 'interesting' conclusion.<br />Does not require great brainwork to follow this one - just line up and join the crew's conga~line, but watch out for those low flying objects!<br />DVD contains great additions re special effects and the 'Mystery' surrounding the deep ... [and for 'Ring' fans Karl Urban's in this one!]
B0000AXE8I|1.0|I was not impressed with this movie at all. I went to watch this movie at the theatre I, can't believe I paid 8 bucks to see Keanu Reeves naked in the begining of this movie. I can't believe they put a sex scene in the movie. I was also suprised to see how many parents brought there children along to see this film. Not only that but, The rest of the movie just goes down hill from there. I started to fal asleep so I just left the theatre YUCK!! I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!
B00005RHGK|4.0|After being subjected to post-modern horror for years, where movies were afraid to just be scary without winking at the audience, we have here, ladies and gentlemen, the scariest 45 minutes of film to come along in AGES.<br />The first half of this movie is so full of dread.  Superbly done.  The rest of the movie...eh.  Once we see the creature, it kinda falls apart.  But I forgive them...especially since the last 10 seconds made my stomach drop.  <br />Again I shake my head in disbelief at people who toss this movie aside.  Probably same folks who poo-pooed &quot;Suspiria&quot; and &quot;Blair Witch&quot;...just WHAT do they define as &quot;scary&quot;???
B00005JM02|4.0|I bought this movie only because Pixar made it. I did not care for the Nemo's father in this movie. He was just a worry wart who talks to much. Reminds me of woody allen. It is a tremendously awesome movie for kids of all ages. Very very funny scenes that you will seem to laugh at over &amp; over again. I still think Pixars best movie's are Toy Story 1&amp;2.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|UNDERWORLD...Vampires vs. Werewolves? Finally a vampire, and/or werewolf, movie where humans aren't prey. This movie is fantastic. I was reeled in the whole time. Vampires and werewolves have been at war for centuries, with each other, but there's a deep dark secret and I'm not telling.<br />Great story and plenty of action. Gothic and dark, I only hope there is a sequel to match, or better, this one.<br />It has its downfalls, but none really worth mentioning(in my opinion).<br />If you like vampire, werewolf, gothic or action movies...DON'T MISS &quot;UNDERWORLD&quot;. You'll be glad you didn't.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|&quot;In The Zone&quot; is definintely Britney Spears' best album to date. It shows she has matured into a woman. The beats of the songs are hot, but her voice is not that good. My favorite songs are Touch of my hand, Toxic, Breathe on me, and Shadow. I have to admit that Christina's voice is better than Britney Spears' voice by far, but Britney's beats are better than Christina's beats by far. Christina's beats are not that good. If you like to dance, buy this album. For Britney haters, please shut the hell up, you have no right to criticize this album because you haven't gotten it yet. Christina is using the advantage of her voice to out do Britney Spears, but Christina sucks in performing. She is not a great dancer or performer. Britney is both an aousome dancer and a performer. I give this album four stars because the one star missing is Britney's voice. If Britney's voice is like Christina's or Jessica Simpson or at least like Madonna, I would immidiately give it five stars. This CD is only for Britney fans, which I am. For Britney haters who want to become her fan, please buy this album and give a chance, don't criticize it. If a song made you to buy the album, then maybe the rest of the songs are also hot.<br />P.S- listen to the bonus tracks too, they're also very hot.
B00005Y7L4|5.0|Battle Royal remains unreleased in the West not because of its controversy but because of distribution problems that the production company Toei is mixed up with. There are several other Toei films that have not made it to the West either and this has something do with distribution sharing rights that are still problematic even in their own country. So the reason for the non-appearance of this great movie is not because it has been banned or refused-classification, but because of money and distribution rights.<br />The film is a violent spin on Lord of the Flies. It is knee-deep in right wing political philosophy that certainly will reverberate in a world still reeling from the effects of terrorist related violence.<br />Battle Royale is set in the future but seems closer to the present. Because of school truancy and violent assaults on teachers the Japanese government has passed the Battle Royale act which allows them to randomly select classes to be sent off to boot camp where there are given the task of murdering one another in a training island until one of them is left and allowed to go free. Each of the students is given a bag which contains supplies and a \\"type\\" of weapon. Detonators are attached around their necks should they try to escape or break the rules. There are also hot zones around the island that will automatically cause a head buster if they step into them.<br />This film is a complete satire on political institutions from start to finish and is certainly very graphic, but is still a lot of fun. The story and characters do develop even among all this last man standing mayhem and there are plenty of twists. In fact this is a memorable and fun film even though a little controversial but I think it is hard to take this film too seriously because it does a lot of comic interludes along way and even the death scenes are played out for laughs - although albeit very violently.<br />This is a slice of sci-fi classic that does have a few morals to boot. Itis a great cinematic experience in a live-action Manga sort of way and if you can stomach the violence you will enjoy it immensely.<br />Unforgettable.
0399230033|4.0|My son loves this book.  While it does not have many words, the illustrations are wonderful.  After about 3 times of reading it we began really looking at the pictures and now the book is quite interactive. The Gorilla uses a colored key to match the color on the bars for each animal.  My 19 month old is not only learning the animal names and their sounds, he is also learning their colors.  He of course has favorite pages that we have to read over and over, but overall, this is the one we have in a small travel size book and the larger library sized board book.
B0000029GA|5.0|this album is great it has no equal to any other album Snoop Dogg was crying when Nas made this CD hes a rapper genius. He makes 50 cent a joke, so for my sake and is buy this now!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00006AW2M|5.0|Let us just look back at 1967 and take all of the albums mentioned here as what they are.... snapshots of music and musical culture and their flowering at the time.<br />It is most definately true that this album resembles Piper at the Gates of Dawn more than Sgt. Pepper.  Reasons being, among many others, the strong penchant for improvisational segments and segues, and the rough-hewn production.  Sgt. Pepper was more a collection of finely polished vignettes, and finds a lot of it's notariety in the sheer technical arena, as a great many recording techniques were born, and the album changed the way all subsequent albums would be recorded.<br />This is not to take anything away from ANY of the albums mentioned, these are just some of the facts as I see them.<br />People mention the arrangements, textures, and Orchestrations both horn and string on Their Satanic Majesties Request, and with good reason.  These are all elements that elevate the songs on this album to what they are.  Anyone bother to note just who ARRANGED all that, and in my opinion, was largely responsible for a good bit of the sonic results we have?  It is none opther than John Paul Jones, of Led Zeppelin, who prior to Zep was one of THE arrangers/orchestrators in the British pop music studio scene at the time.  I feel that his contributions on this album in particular cannot be stressed enough.<br />All that being said, it is a great snapshot of a place and time, and is a musical landmark for all of time.<br />Happy listening to all.
B000066744|5.0|a compelling story with excellent cinamaphotograghy that captures<BR>the heart of the innocents and diversity of love. A film that stirs the senses and leaves one straining for the sound of the immense ocean sea.
B00008H2LB|5.0|My favorite CD was Hybrid Theory till this master piece, here are the songs reviewed in no particular order..<br />From The Inside 10/10 - One of the best songs on the CD.  Chesters voice is brillant from whe he is singing to when he is yelling.

0743216458|5.0|I first learned of E Company from the most common source....HBO's Band of Bros mini-series.  I fell in love w/ their story and recently bought the book for a relative.  My wife's grandfather fought in the battle of the bulge and is still happy to discuss it w/ family.  The book is well done and you really see what the (often overused term) hero is all about.  A great read......it is amazing what these boys (turned to men) did at such a young age....
B000066O91|4.0|Simple Plan captures nicely--and perhaps takes to extremes--the emotion felt by adolescents on the edge of adulthood, when it seems to them that the world is falling on them, that their lives are the worst ever lived, and that they are alone and stand little chance of establishing any emotional connection with anyone. Combine that with catchy melodies, good vocals, and a nice beat, and Simple Plan has come up with a, um, simple plan for talking to the darkness and insecurity that lurks in the heart of everyone from junior high through college age, and even older.<br />Each of the songs takes the point of view of a lonely kid who has reached the edge of adulthood, only to find that things aren't all they were cracked up to be. It may be a kid who can't find or who has lost a girlfriend (&quot;Addicted&quot; or &quot;Meet You There&quot;), or who has entered the working world and feels the loss of childhood (&quot;The Worst Day Ever&quot;)or whose parental relationships have frayed in bitterness (&quot;Perfect&quot; or &quot;One Day&quot;). But each kid is alone, without anyone to share his hurt, and without much ability to put his hurt into perspective, therefore such titles as &quot;The Worst Day Ever&quot; and &quot;God Must Hate Me&quot; (decried in some reviews) do sum up what the person is feeling--and what we sometimes feel in our hearts, however grown up we may happen to be.<br />Contains two bonus tracks from the earlier version of the CD, &quot;Grow Up&quot; (the character doesn't wanna)--a rather juvenile song with a younger point of view than most of the other songs, and &quot;One By One&quot;, an interesting song about breaking away and preserving one's dreams.<br />Each song uses simple, often powerful language, to express the depression and angst. Yet, on balance, we feel that the characters are going to get past this. There is no sense that the kids are going to spiral downwards with drugs, crime, or other self-destructive behavior. The lonely kid willeventually find his girl, the kid bitter at his relationship with his parents will eventually find an adult relationship with them.<br />Perhaps the most powerful song, though, interestingly, the fourth released as a single, is &quot;Perfect&quot;, the song of a kid addressing his dad (most likely in his mind), and grieving over the formerly good relationship they had which has turned sour. The words are alternately bitter, sad, and hurtful, until at last the kid comes to terms with the fact that the relationship is gone, and all he can do is go on with his life despite his dad's disapproval of the way he's living it. It is powerful stuff, and perhaps a broader age range can relate to this particular song.<br />Simple Plan has struck a chord with this CD. I suspect, though, that there is a limit to how far they can delve into teen angst with any degree of success. I await their second album (Spring 2004) with interest.
0060931736|4.0|When I went into my school's library to pick out an independent reading book, I asked my librarian for some recommendations. I showed her my list and right off the bat she picked out The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie by Muriel Spark. She said it was a beautiful book and so interesting that she could not put it down. I was skeptical until I found it and saw that it wasn't very long. I used to love reading, but I always found the recommended books (especially the ones on the reading list) exceedingly boring.<br />I started reading this book and I immediately connected with the young girls' love for their teacher and their naive views of life. I wasn't expecting these girls to speak of issues such as sex and love. They seemed to be quite interested in their teacher's love life.<br />The setting of this book is mainly within the school where Miss Brodie teaches. Throughout this book Miss Brodie is said to be in her \\"prime\\" which I didn't really quite catch on to until later in the novel...... I didn't see a huge turning point, or any climax whatsoever. The book seemed to talk about the lives of the girls while they were young, and eventually in their own prime. It also shows these girls while they are older and no longer talk to Miss Jean Brodie. ..This book was an excellent read and I was very surprised with its turnout. It is the perfect book for any woman.
0385504209|5.0|I have not lost sleep or been late for work due to a book for a long time.  This time it's Dan Brown's fault!  Excellent read, informative and exciting.  Just read &quot;Beyond Belief - The Secret Gospel of Thomas&quot;, which first brought the actions of the early Christian church to my awareness.  This book was a great follow on for me on that topic.  But &quot;Da Vinci Code&quot; stands as being just a good 'ol pager turner mystery!
0380789035|1.0|I'll keep this short and sweet. This book was one of the most frustrating of the year for me, and I'm not sure why so many people are blown away by this book. The plot is very awkward and very little seems to happen throughout the novel. Why the book is 600+ pages is beyond me as it seems to me it could have been half that and noone would be the wiser (but still equally annoyed). The only thing that I really enjoyed about the novel itself was the concept of all the gods living amongst the regular joes. Great concept, poor novel.
0688163173|4.0|I read. Alot. This book is one of the few times I actually put a book down and had to absorb what I read instead of flipping it to the side and picking up the next.  Mystic River was tremendous this was better.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This is Rock history, and it just doesn't get any better. As somebody said, there are no highlights in this stunning set. Led Zeppelin was a continuum. It was a total experience and it is senseless to try and break it down.<br />The release of this flawless DVD set around the same time as the equally flawless triple 'live' CD How The West Was Won was almost disorientating to the die-hard Zep fan. Having eventually stopped pinching myself, I play them both as often as I can, and thank Page that we have been blessed with these releases.<br />A few years ago there was a substantial poll in which Led Zeppelin were voted The Greatest Band Of All Time - ahead of even The Beatles. No argument here. If you happen to know any non-believers, just strap 'em into a chair and make them watch this set.<br />Robert's lyrics actually got me into Tolkien and Spenser (The Faerie Queen, above all), and to have this whole lotta Zep at the same time as the conclusion to the absolutely breathtaking Lord Of The Rings trilogy is almost a mystical experience in itself.<br />No, there was never anybody to touch them. Not even close. In my 'humble' opinion, there was nobody worthy of cleaning their shoes. In Tina's words, they were simply the best. I can only hope that the boys will round off this wave of LZ releases by getting together with Jason (the only exceptional drummer with a moral right to sit in his dad's seat) and do a serious tour and album. <br />Sorry folks, I do tend to ramble on...
B00009TB5G|5.0|Not only the moive , with the extended version, extremely good, but the appendix and other features gives you a lot of info<BR>about the original book, the production... which is also very <BR>entertaining
B000002H38|5.0|This review is not needed because most people have done an excellent job in their reviews. But so often, the word &quot;classic&quot; is thrown around and its not earned or deserved. Not the case with Anita Baker's Rapture. Toni Braxtion wish she could work it like this, but there is only one Anita. Don't get me wrong, I like Toni's earlier work but Anita remains the Queen. Sadly, we might hear not her voice for a while because she is going through problems with her record label. But this album remains a jewel. They don't make music like this anymore.
0739307312|5.0|This book does not read like others in the sence that the story developes as the characters do. Dan Brown writes in a style that allows the reader to feel accomplshment by using so many short chapters. It allows you to keep the interest of the multiple plots that are developing without loosing track of any one story while they intertwine. The story developes at a very fast pace and will keep you entertained to the end.  Highly reccommended reading.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|The Maiden attitude is there, but more importantly, so are hooks, riffs and melodies. It's quite refreshing to see an 80s metal band produce a disc still in their classic style without sounding stale. Late Metallica could take a lesson.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|This album has been getting a lot of bad press as 'Paul McCartney's version' of let it be.  I disagree with this- but I also disagree with the 'as the Beatles intended it' sticker on the CD's packaging.  Half of the band was dead- so that's not possible.  As the band intended it (according to the Beatles Anthology) was to be a live album, and what we have are rough demos and rehearsals that are sonically enhanced by 'Naked' and &quot;Spectorized&quot; on the original.  Call me an idiot, but I like the new version better for one reason- it sounds like an album, and it sounds incredible.  I like the new order of the songs and the lack of strings, choirs, and tape hiss- but I agree it should not be the replacement of 'Let It Be.'  Like the 'Fly on the wall' CD that accompanies 'LIBN,' this album is essential listening for anyone who loved the original, and in my opinion, everyone else.
0060934913|4.0|This was a good read.  I enjoyed all of his stories, most I could relate to.  Some I missed and still enjoyed.  Having worked in few star restaurants things a bit different and yet surprisingly the same.  Another good book is Clam Chowder: The Server's Field Manual.  I think it can only be purchased through it's isbn or the webite:  clamchowder.biz.  A great read for waiters and others.
B0000074BS|4.0|Time and time again I'v returned to this to get my interest back in music. After periods of listening to new wishy washy over hyped releases I get turned off to having a night of music listening. One of my favourite ways to renew my enthusiasm is to put this on the cd player.It never fails and I never get tired of it. Its an unusual mix of pop/jazz/rock that is totally unique to this group.Sound wise my red book cd isnt the best but the music IS. For recording it gets 80% and music 96%. There is an SACD version out but the price is steep but must be worth it.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|Best:<br />1) It's stylish, dark and gothic to the hilt (for people who love that kind of thing).<BR>2) The creature effects makeup, CGI rendering and fight action was outstanding.<BR>3) There's a complex story to go with the visuals and things happen that you won't expect.<BR>4) There's plenty of special features including 4 documentaries and 2 commentary tracks.<br />Worst:<br />1) You may, like some, think that it's TOO similar to other high-budget films (like &quot;The Matrix&quot;, &quot;Blade&quot; &amp; &quot;The Crow&quot;).<br />Recommendation:<br />If you really like vampire and werewolf movies, this film adds yet another twist to the old legends. If you liked the the slickness of &quot;The Matrix&quot; and the savageness of &quot;Blade II&quot; (the films I think it's most like), then I'm willing to bet you'll like this one too. Get it.
B00006RCNW|5.0|You know a show is great when too many people 'dispise' it &amp; that's what happened with the finest episodic tv show ever, &quot;The Shield'!!<br /> Sure a 'few' liberties are in the writng of &quot;The Shield&quot; but it's the closest thing you'll ever see on tv to the realities of both life on the street of an inner city, &amp; the way REAL POLICE get necessary things done. BRAVO.<br /> I live in this 'type' of environment &amp; 'know' detecives just like those that appear in &quot;The Shield&quot;. Most people won't admit to the reality this show brings out, but that's the way it is.<br /> Reality TV is a joke, &quot;The Shield&quot; is closer to reality than ANY show on television, but critic's &amp; 'tv watchdogs' &amp; most viewers don't want to face a &quot;REAL&quot; tv show. This IS reality tv folks. Deal with it &amp; enjoy it like I do.<br /> I must give some credit to the &quot;tv censors&quot; for allowing the language &amp; violence that &quot;The Shield&quot; portrays(to keep it as real to life as tv will allow) because this 'fictional' tv show gives you what the reality tv  show &quot;COPS&quot; is 'supposed' to but doesn't.<br /> Where &quot;NYPD BLUE&quot;(which I still enjoy, &amp; is close to reality)tried to break in the door of what is accessible for adult tv viewers, &quot;The Sheild&quot; blew the doors off it's hinges and should be applauded &amp; recognized for it honesty, &amp; fine performances &amp; writing!<br /> Frankly, after watching Shawn Ryan's 'hokey' tv effort &quot;Nash Bridges&quot; I had no faith in a new 'cop show' with his name attached, but like all great artists Ryan has a 'dark' side to him &amp; we now get the pleasure of watching special tv when viewing &quot;The Shield&quot;! <br />NO IT'S NOT FOR CHILDREN, or for adult viewer's with the mentality of a child, but that what's so great about this series, it's complicated &amp; deals with ADULT issue's and dare I say therefore it probably won't survive the 3rd season.Sigh. <br /> I say this because the 2nd season outshined it's premier, &amp; should Ryan &amp; Chiklis(et al)try &amp; push the 'tv boundries'even further in the 3rd season, the people with power will likely crush this great show. Sadly most great things are limited, &amp; not appreciated until they are gone(painters/writers/musicians/ect)but HOPEFULLY<BR>the stark genius of this show will survive &amp; i'll have at least 1 hr of GREAT tv to look forward to each week. Sadly writing &amp; acting of this caliber cannot sustain more than a few weeks out of each year, but I can't wait until March rolls around!<br /> Thank you Shawn Ryan-Michael Chiklis-CCH Pounder, hell everyone<BR>that is involved with the creation of this fantastic show! It proves you don't 'have to go to' the movies for a magical moment<BR>but in all likelyhood it's greatness spells doom for futher sucess.
0739307312|5.0|Maybe the characters are a little flat and last quarter lacks the strength of the rest of the book; but, if for no other reason than this book got me to look at &quot;The Last Supper&quot; it was worth it.<br />Yet, it was better than just that.  I looked forward to each reading and forced myself to put it down each night.  I don't think about religion and art much, so it was a bit of a catalyst for me.  A perfect book, no; one I'd recommend to all my friends, absolutely.
B0000640SA|5.0|I got Mememto for me and a friend to watch, and I found the movie to be VERY GOOD! Of course I found myself confused in some parts, but you have to think about it, and at least have to see it twice to understand what is going on in this film. The movie consists of Leonard, a man who after his acccident can not remember things that happen as recent as 10 minutes ago, so he takes pictures of people, places, and things and jots down notes so that he can see what he has to do. <BR> Now the movie plays BACKWARDS, it is like what one reviewer said; it is like going to sleep, having dinner, having lunch, going to school, having breakfast, and waking up. Leonard is looking for the guy who murdered and rapist who raped and killed his wife. Now the chase is on, I am not going to give away the ending, but this is a GOOD movie, and not to be taken light of. You have to think about what is going on, and just when you think you had it solve, there is another twist which makes it more interesting. It is like a good detective story with great twists, and I recommend this movie who are interested in a good mystery. Good movie.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Matrix reloaded is absolutely and incredibly breathtaking, specially the fighting sceen with ex-agent Smith against Neo. the effects and the soundtrack of this movie is fabulous. The Matrix has you from begining to end!
0060537639|1.0|Mr. Menzies, for all his work, has compiled something (one hesitates to call it a book) that would not pass muster in most middle-school history classes.<br />Even the most ardent Sinoplhiles would hesitate to call this work &quot;history&quot;.  It is less historical than Oliver Stone's JFK and more on a level with something out of Kim Jong Il's PR network.<br />Shame on you Gavin!!
B00009V7P8|5.0|I was so pleasantly surprised when I heard this collection of songs! Lush string arrangements combined with lyrics that seem to be written by someone much older than this young Irish lad make for what I consider to be one of the best CD's I own.<br />I must mention that Lisa Hannigan's contributions to this album brought the quality of these songs to a an even higher level. She has a voice that is comparable to Sarah McLachlan's, yet it stands on it's own merit.<br />Bravo Damien &amp; friends!
B00009V7T2|5.0|When I heard that Atdi split up I cried. Then I heard that The Mars Volta was coming out and I rejoyced. Anything Cedric and Omar do together is going to be breathtaking. They are the best duo in music since John and Paul. Every time they make music it becomes beyond words. I have to agree that they have gotten better at their instruments. But I lived to hear Atdi so their new music makes perfect sense to me. It only took one listen before I knew I would like them just as much as Atdi. Checkout the cd and fall in love as I have Since Acrobatic Tenament, In-Casino-Out, El Gran Orgo, Vaya, And Relationship of Command. <br />                                      Enjoy
1587990717|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It served to remind me of the meaning of the saying &quot;I'd rather be lucky than smart.&quot;  The author offers a number of descriptive examples of highly unlikely events that have occurred--contradicting consenus opinion.
0805062971|5.0|Fight Club was an action packed book that should be read for nothing more than pure enjoyment.  The odd relationships and skewed views on the world today are ingenious.  Once I picked it up, I could not put it down until I finished.  There was not one part of the book that I didn't find interesting.  I suggest this book for anyone on your list.
B0000DCGT4|3.0|I really should dislike this movie, because the comedy is even more disgusting and base than the previous movies in this series, but when the movie is funny, it's hilarious, and I couldn't stop laughing.  Be warned, however, that much of the humor comes from gross situations.<br />In this edition, Jim Levinstein (Jason Biggs) asks Michelle Flaherty (Alysson Hannigan) to marry him.  The big moment is to happen in a very nice restaurant.  Jim hints that he wants to ask Michelle a very important question, and his hinting about is misinterpreted by Michelle, who crawls under the table to do what she thinks Jim wants.  In the mean time, Jim's dad, played by SCTV alumni Joe Levy, shows up and sits in Michelle's chair, unaware that she is under the table.  Michelle goes unnoticed until Jim's dad mentions the wedding proposal, which causes Michelle to bump the underside of the table.  Jim jumps up, his pants are down, and it's embarrassment and pandemonium.  As funny as this scene is, it gets better, or worse, depending on how you look at it, from there.<br />The movie ends up being a series of gags from beginning to end, that are both funny and often disgusting.  Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott) is often involved in many of these scenes.  In one scene Steve and Jim are in the library with a dog when an accident with a cake happens.  When Jim's dad opens the library door to bring in Michelle's parents, Steve and Jim appear to be in a very bizarre position with respect to the dog.  You'll have to see this one to understand it or believe it.<br />There are another pair of scenes that are related involving a gay bar, a bachelor party, with Stifler involved, of course, and Michelle's parents.  While not every moment of these scenes are funny, they are in several places, and I found myself laughing all the way through the scene where Jim is supposed to be having dinner at home with Michelle's parents.<br />Stifler manages to get himself invited to the wedding, and even manages to convince Michelle's mother to let him carry the wedding ring.  Unfortunately Stifler manages to lose the ring, which a small dog then eats.  How Stifler gets the ring back is simultaneously funny and gross.<br />While Stifler acts like the jerk he is for much of the movie, near the end we see Stifler make a mistake, and then pull out the stops to correct his error.  For just a moment we get to see Stifler actually act like a human, and the movie turns out all right.<br />I watched many of the extra features on the DVD.  The two features I thought were the best were the deleted scenes and the outtakes.  Watch them after seeing the movie.<br />I gave this movie three stars even though it was a laugh-fest all the way through.  Much of the humor is gross and disgusting, and the situations used to get the laughs are totally unrealistic and bizarre (well, none of these have ever happened to anyone I know).  If you enjoyed the first two \\"American Pie\\" movies, you'll enjoy this one as well.  Definitely not a family movie and many adults will find portions of the movie a bit too bizarre to be enjoyable.  However, for those who like Mad Magazine and can handle gross jokes, this movie is a blast.s to convince Michelle's mother to let him carry the wedding ring.

0385504209|5.0|Yes, the topic of the Holy Grail can be found ad nauseum on-line or in conspiracy theory books, but, regardless, I found The Da Vinci Code hard to put down. It is intriguing even if it can be somewhat predictable, I lerned a lot and his sources and interesting factiouds throughout the book make the plot and the central idea seem even more credible. It definitely caught my attention and Dan Brown has earned my respect as a fiction writer.
B00006F83Y|5.0|This is easily the most pleasing album I've ever bought and will most likely remain so for some time. This is stoner rock at its finest...no, better yet rock at its finest and it is incomparably imaginative and artistic.<BR>   First off, what really blows you away about this album is the incredible sense of dynamics that QOTSA exhibits. From the hard riffs and gritty vocals of Six Shooter and Millionaire to the eerily poetic and hauntingly symphonic melody of Mosquito Song, there are no musical boundaries this album doesn't tear apart. <BR>   The overall concept of the album (the radio station interludes and conclusions to most of the songs) is a quirky stab at the homogenized world of pop rock. Granted, this concept gets a bit old and the fake radio personalities are annoying as hell, but they were aptly recorded. The album really does throw conventional rock to the dogs and it shows. <BR>   The singles No One Knows, First it Giveth and Go with the Flow in and of themselves are radically progressive. Nothing is quite like when a QOTSA song comes on the radio and there aren't any comparable singles out there in my mind.<BR>   But the non-single tracks are also fantastic. The Mark Lanegan powered millionaire and six shooter are addictive and fun to listen to. After a hard day, it's a godsend to sit down and listen to Lanegan belt it out. But other softer songs like sky is fallin, gonna leave you and another love song are equally melodious and fun to listen to. And again, we mustn't forget the masterful hidden track mosquito song, a veritable symphony masterpiece. <BR>   In closing, there isn't much to say about this album except that it's QOTSA full throttle, plaing how they were meant play and sounding like nothing else out there. If you want to hear rock like it's meant to sound, pick this up before you take your next breath.
B00008H2LB|3.0|As I've stated many-a-time, I do not HATE Linkin Park.  They aren't too bad.  Chester's screaming with Mike's smooth rapping is definitely a good combination.   The one complaint I have is sort of a big-gish complaint.  And if it wasn't for this, I would like them so so so so so so so so much better.<br />ALL OF THEIR SONGS SOUND THE SAME AND ALL OF THEIR SONGS ARE ABOUT *THE SAME THING.*<br />Every! Single! One! of their songs talks about a friend who's betrayed them, and how they're miserable.    The first couple times, it's like &quot;Yeah, well, we can all relate at some point or another.&quot;  But then it's like... oh. my.  Please stop whining.    <br />Linkin Park, with a dose of creativity, could be much better in my eyes.  No experimentation with different sounds: it's all exactly the same.  So basically it sounds like the same song over and over and over on their CDs.  They AREN'T un-talented people; I like their vocal styles.  But I just wish they would vary the way their songs sound.  That is all.  Okay album.  Highlights are &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot;, &quot;Faint&quot;, &quot;Lying From You&quot;, and &quot;Numb.&quot;  No surprise 3 / those 4  are the singles thus far.<br />So, all in all, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who doesn't like all songs sounding the same and all songs having the exact same type of lyrics.  If you like that, by all means, BUY IT.  They're talented guys.  I like them.  For the fifth time, they just need to sort of have a smidge of variety and creativity amongst their own style.   Peace out.
B00004TH6O|4.0|I just purchased Rated R as it was the only Queens album I hadn't bought yet. It earns four and a half stars and I hold it in high regard. The album deviates a lot from the sound that was pioneered in QOTSA's self titled album, which was carried on in Songs For The Deaf. For starters, it's a lot lighter and airier, without the hard rock riffs that carried mostly throughout the other albums. Also, they make a lot of really overt references to drug use (like in Feel Good Hit of the Summer), and QOTSA and Songs For The Deaf steer clear a little more from that. All in all, they must've been really high and probably outside a movie theatre when they wrote some of this stuff. But if that's what gets it done, the more power to 'em cause some of these tracks are fantastic. Feel Good Hit of the Summer is a great opener and sets the crazy, in many places hallucination-induced mood that the album exudes. <BR>   My favorite track is Lost Art of Keeping a Secret. I could listen to this all day, it's just got such a fantastic chorus and a sweet guitar part. Auto-pilot is relaxing and catchy and I love hearing the chorus in that two. This song is where the airy guitar riffs really start to sound sweet. <BR>   And of course, I can't forget Quick and the Pointless. This is comparable to Six Shooter on Songs For the Deaf...except it's about child molestation, as far as I can tell. Nick Oliveri's vocals are viscous and throaty. I love it, this is one of those songs that just makes you smile despite how crazy it is. <BR>   On the whole, the rest of the CD is well rounded but to conserve space, let's just say that it's a far cry from Songs For the Deaf but still worth the buy

B000066NW0|1.0|What justifies this &quot;artist&quot; getting 4 1/2 stars, average review? Its a well known fact that avril is the most foul pieces of manufactured garbage ever to be a pawn in a prefabricated album on this earth, but what would some alien think if it came and saw a 4 1/2 out of 5 star review?
B00005MP58|5.0|I read other reviews before buying the DVD, and I was worried about the &quot;loss of color&quot; that was mentioned. However, I have not had to deal with this problem, and so I say it is definately worth the risk. Even with faded color, you still get plenty of Colin. Gotta Love It!
B00000JCOV|1.0|Ok wooow like i like hard rock and stuff but i meen where do we draw the line? Slipknots actual musicians are not bad , and i think it's great how they have 2 drummers, it's very cool. But what .. about the lyrics, seriosuly, anyone could do what they do they just scream all the stuff sounds the same, YAA Ripitty ... i am hated blah blah blah dude go get a tool album.<br /> i guess like if you were going to have a mosh or sumthing itd be ok but not just to listen to, thats about it.

B00004Z4WR|4.0|What can anyone say about a no-holds barred Nick Cage movie with fast cars, faster women, and non-stop pyrotechnics other than the fact that it fairly rocks? While surely not providing any ostensible grist for Academy Award nominations, other than perhaps for best special effects with all the car sequences, and some imaginative chase set-ups and scenes, this is a strictly by-the-numbers action flick, meant to appeal to the young set, and still appeal to old guys like me who enjoy a pleasant evening away from the \\"sturm und drang' of everyday life.<br />All that said, I really did enjoy watching the movie, although I had no doubt as to the resolution of the existential dilemma presented to Nick, given the fact he is the most worthy of the anti-heroes in recent memory, a good \\"bad\\" guy we root for from the very start. And he does have a special woman, (no, not the sexy Angelina Jolie, although she is sweet indeed) by the way of his special personal vehicle, a super-charge mustang he refers to by name, and seems to have male-female kind of bond with. The supporting cast here is terrific, from Robert Duvall to Will Patton and many, many others, all of whom contribute to a tight, entertaining, and eminently enjoyable ride of a lifetime. Enjoy!

B00006IUL7|4.0|This is a quite diverting albeit not totally successful turn into film noire for both Robin Williams and Al Pacino, and the scenes between them are sometime electric with the kind of charisma such notable actors and stars often deliver. The script, too, is uneven, given the fascinating premise of a highly regarded but somewhat unconventional big-city detective and a somewhat disreputable character at that, (played well by Pacino) brought into the backwaters of remote Alaska to help solve a grisly and unsettling murder of a young and attractively seductive co-ed. From the outset, Pacino's character is wracked with insomnia which seems to be a result of both his own haunted past and the strange environment he now finds himself surrounded by.<br />Very early on, the detective and his partner discover someone suspicious revisiting the crime scene, and in pursuit Pacino makes a fateful mistake that dials up the tension level and sets the stage for the insidious cat and mouse game that ensues between the pursued killer (Williams, in an over-the top performance that provides a pulse-raising coda to the progression of events) on the one hand, and the haunted and increasingly confused and bewildered Pacino, on the other. What results from this deadly conflict is a nightmare on steroids, a film noire shot in stark and bold Technicolor shades and hues.<br />The supporting cast, including Hilary Swank doing a nice turn as an overly earnest young Alaskan policewoman, veteran Paul Dooley, and relative new-comer Martin Donovan, all help to promote the suffocating sense of a claustrophobic whirl of events gone tragically out of control. Not for the squeamish, I fear, but great entertainment for someone willing to see Pacino in yet another portrayal of a cop over the edge, and the surprisingly deadly Robin Williams as a most worthy opponent for the cop's relentless efforts to pursue him. Enjoy
076790592X|5.0|What an inspiring story!  A younger man takes his last class from his teacher of many years ago, who is dying from a fatal illness.  The class is about learning the meaning of life and they have their meetings on Tuesdays.  Morrie Schwartz decided that he wasn't going to give up on life, but to live it to the fullest and share his life and love with as many of his friends and acquaintances that he could in the time that was left.  Mitch was one of those blessed.  When you know you are going to die you learn what is really important in life.  It is not what we have been told repeatedly-that to be happy one must have more and more, that money and power would bring us happiness, no...what is important is to be able to love others and to work at helping others and taking an interest in those around you.  It is true, but also it can be hard to let your defenses down and just trust in the power of love, but when you do, even if it is for just a short while, the over-whelming feeling of well being in your body and soul is amazing.  While I was reading the book I shed a few tears but when I finished I felt blessed and uplifted.  The simple life is not so bad when you are surrounded by those you love and who love you.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When Firefly first came out, I was very disappointed. &quot;Who are these people? Why are there so many of them? Cowboys in space? Dumb idea&quot;. I never got attached to it, becuase I had a feeling FOX would cancel it anyways from the start. Then I saw a couple more epsoides and it started to grow on me but it seemed disjointed from week to week. Then it was canceled. I had missed about half the episodes aired...Oh well. <br />Then a friend sent me a VHS copy of &quot;War Stories&quot;. It was tight, tense, funny and the cast WORKED. I missed the show for the first time.<br />Then the DVD came out. I got to see the episodes the way god- I mean Joss intended. Wow. Just wow.<br />I got to see the whole arc, see the charicters grow and mesh, and relize the idiots at FOX playied the weakest episodes first and ignored the fantistic pilot epsiode for for the very last, the one that would have shut me up with all my questions, and make me want more.<br />Great cast, great stories, SFX, sets, the whole universe is interesting and room for expansion ( tidbits of which are mentioned in Josses commentaries). Like Cisley, AK of Northern Exposure (when is THAT going to be on DVD BTW!?!?!), the good ship Serenity is a place you wish were real because it looks like so much fun ( if you dont mind the occational Reaver attacks, Alliance patrols and bad food).<br />Thank goodness it looks like there will be Firefly movie! Get the DVD. Well worth the money.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Highly reccomend.  If you liked Buffy, than you will like this.  If you like Sci-Fi, then you will like this.  Heck, if you like westerns, you will like this, and even if you don't like westerns, you will STILL like this.
0786868694|5.0|I admit that I started watching her show only because of seeing this incredibly beautiful woman on the screen.  It was several minutes before I noticed the point of the show was cooking, and boy can she cook.  She has the technical skills of any other gourmet, but she adds her personality to the meals that transfers very well from the screen to her books.  She truly has fun and makes the reader enjoy following along.  My wife and I have even enjoyed ourselves when we failed at one of her messy-style recipes.  It doesn't matter, its all in good fun, and when success occurs, wow, it's a delight for the palate.  Fortunately my wife is not the jealous type, and she happily accepts all of the Nigella books that I give to her.  The book is well worth investing one's time, money, and enthusiasm.
0151008116|5.0|This book makes my heart beat faster. It is wondrous and magical and thrilling. The author writes like a Canadian Italo Calvino: full of life, motion, thoughts, absent of dead prose or sluggish characterizations...and Pi even sleeps in a tree. Shake yourself out of the lethargy of tedious novels like Richard Russo's Empire Falls (never should have even been nominated for the Pulitzer), and invigorate your mind with this divine morsel.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|When I first hear Me Agaisnt music from MusicTV, I think that I skip this album. Good that I give it second change. Album have many good songs like Toxic, Outrageous, Showdown or Breathe on me. Song Me Against The Music is getting better more than I hear it. There are several songs I did not like much like Boom Boom but that because i dont like personally Rap or Hiphop(Nothing wrong in Miss Spears voice or singing). I still like that Britney is her best album but if you like Her music this is must. Note this is more for adults than children.<br />Only thing that remove the fifth star is Jive fault. Ruin good cd to but some stupid player for autorun. Every computer have certain players to play Music-CD's. This Cd dont meet CD-standards. But play still good in Mediaplayer.
B000003CM8|4.0|For the first half of the 1970s, the Allman Brothers Band was the most influential rock and blues group in America, setting new standarts for live performances with their twenty-thirty-forty minute jams.  At first, they were an almost pure blues band, and this 1969 album features some of their best and most powerful blues tunes, including \\"It's Not My Cross To Bear\\" and the classic \\"Whipping Post\\".    The late Duane Allman was a masterful guitarist, his playing versatile and tasteful, and younger brother Gregg Allman's vocals are soulful and confident. This is almost \\"The Gregg Allman Brothers Band\\", actually; all five original songs are written by the younger Allman brother, who also takes all the lead vocals.  The dual lead guitar onslaught of Duane Allman and Dickey Betts wasn't yet quite as developed at this point as it would be just a year later, at least not in the studio, but there is still plenty of instrumental highlights to be found, including some sizzling slide guitar playing on a tight, muscular cover of the prewar blues classic \\"Trouble No More\\" (mistakenly credited to Muddy Waters, who played it, but certainly didn't write it. It is probably about the same age as Muddy).    Some may find this music to be overly indulgent, particularly the slightly psychedelic seven-minute \\"Dreams\\", and it is true that a few of of the Allman Brothers' songs would have benefitted from tighter arrangements. But most of what is here is excellent no mattewr how you look at it. A powerful rhythm section which at times sounds like it is barely kept under control. Some blistering lead guitar. Gregg Allman's swirling organ and strong, bluesy vocals. And a very convincing batch of songs, including several classic tunes which are still part of the group's set today, forty years later.  A fine, fine debut, and there were even better things to come.  Highly recommended.
B0000B1OFL|2.0|If you're going to re-make a movie, then do it properly. If you're going to use the same title, names and gimmick and that's it then you have 2002's The Italian Job.<br />This was a great opportunity to re-make a classic with enough sympathy and sufficient nods to the original to make it different yet retaining all the excitement and fun of the 1969 version but somewhere along the line all of this is missing. F Gary Gray may be a decent director however, in this movie at least, his talents are wasted.<br />With a plot that you could drive umpteen Mini coopers through, the actors don't have much to play with here; for once Wahlberg is one-dimensional. I expected more from him after decent performances in The Perfect Storm amongst others. Theron is there as the eye-candy and little else. I cringed when Charlie (Wahlberg) asks her to join up with them and she refuses at first, only to reconsider later. This was so scripted that both my wife and I correctly guessed she'd initially say no, then it would cut to her thinking of her deceased father and then she'd call Charlie to tell him she's in and instantly hang up. We've seen this so many times, this must be in the mythical 'Rules of Drama' book that most Hollywood Producers each receive upon graduating from Film School.<br />It's no coincidence that the film goes into a tailspin once Bridger (Donald Sutherland) dies early on. There's no substance here, it's just stunts, unlikely scenarios and unlikely set-up scenes for forthcoming plot turns (I mean, who calls the cable company as soon as you lose a signal - don't you fiddle with the cables, wires, check plugs etc? And when the cable 'girl' comes, do you expect her to start opening doors for some spurious reason?).<br />The Mini Coopers ARE this movie. Mos Def does little, Jason Statham is the charming brute driving specialist and Seth Green, who perhaps comes out the best in this movie, is the computer whiz. Oh and Norton is the baddie but then you knew that anyway.<br />The car chases are fun; nothing like the original but fun nonetheless. The remainder is mediocre. Scripted, cliched and obvious.r />The car chases are fun; nothing like the original but fun nonetheless. The remainder is mediocre. Scripted, cliched and obvious.

0385503954|5.0|Atonement is a wonderful piece of fiction, one that enthralled me from beginning to end. The novel begins as a quaint, well-told tale about a few days at an English country estate in the 1930s. Young Briony has written a play and intends to stage it with her visiting cousins. She witnesses an interchange between her older sister, Cecilia, and Robbie, their housekeeper's son, telling a lie that destroys several lives. The years pass and Cecilia, Robbie and Briony attempt to move on from Cecilia's sin. The past continues to haunt them, even after Briony becomes a successful playwright...<br />The closing passages of the novel are some of the most powerful I have read. Atonement is a serious piece of fiction, not something to pick up if you are in search of something light. It may take a little patience to get into. The first part of the novel is quite slow (although I thought it was wonderful, something to be savored), but it gains momentum and becomes one of the most riveting and powerful novels I've read in a long time. I recommend this enthralling read from a mater storyteller.
0385504209|4.0|When I first heard about this book, I did not consider it.  I am not a person who normally reads mystery and suspense.  But a friend said she loved this book and I thought why not.  So I bought the book over the Holiday's and to my surprise I could not put it down.  It was great! It was suspenseful, intriguing and kept me on the edge of my seat (well airplane seat).  To be honest the ending kind of dragged but that could have been me, wanting to know what would happen to the main characters. Highly recommend it.
B0000CFW87|2.0|and people actually take this stuff seriously?  This cd (and music like it) is about as enjoyable as listening to a tomcat screech and yowl the night away right outside of your window.  The comparisons to Caruso are unfair and totally unwarranted. . . if you want something that's like Caruso, BUY CARUSO (not some Celine Dion wannabe)!!!  Better yet, look into some stuff by placido domingo or pavarotti. . . anything's better than throwing your hard earned bucks down the drain on this mediocre excuse for brilliance.  The guy has a decent enough voice (hence the reason that I gave him 2 stars. . . in light of the -50 stars that this album so richly deserves, but I guess the masses want their meaningless, \\"heartfelt\\" filler a la Celine Dion's hit from Titanic. . . so, if you like crap like Clay Aiken and Cher and Titanic pop-trash. . . by all means, blow your brains (and eardrums) out with this pathetic sham of an album.  Music like this makes me want to hurl, but. . . then again. . . I prefer ORIGINAL artists who actual push the limits of popular tastes and sensibilities. . . not carbon copy swills who rip-off contemporary conventions and play on the sentimentality of a massive audience of morons.  Another reviewer said this guy's \\"god-sent\\"???  Puuuuhhhh-leeeaze. . . if such is the case, it's clear that God hates us all and finds it amusing to behold people cowtowing to a musical ant like this like he's some kind of genius or something.  Give me something with a little heart and soul any day of the week. . . as opposed to this \\"bang-your-head-against-the-wall-to-make-it-stop\\" sensation that such bland crap like Josh BOREman inspires.  People who like this kind of junk need to have their heads and ears examine. . . and hopefully, expose themselves to a bit of decent music before exalting such base *#&@!  Saying this guy is a great musician (and likening him to vocal gods like Enrico Caruso) is like comparing Brittney Spears to Aretha Franklin. . . an exercise of futility, if you ask me.  The people that like this are just older equivalents to teenyboppers. . . avoid at all costs if you really love music and apprecite artists as opposed to hacks like this.  Then again, if you enjoy pop music with trite production and cheesy sentimentality. . . then, by all means. . . knock yourself out.  Just don't listen to it within 15 miles of me, got it?

B0000CBY24|5.0|Whale Rider is a powerful and lovely film made by a insightful director, hard working cast, and a star-in-the-making, Keisha Castle-Hughes. Where has she been hiding?! I saw this movie three times within three weeks, once driving to Santa Monica (an hour trip) to see it with my sister and her two daughters. I suggest, no urge, anyone with daughters to see this movie. It is a strong, positive role model for women.<BR>This movie affected me very deeply. Last summer, I seemed to be surrounded by blow'em up and kill'em movies, and I was waiting for a more hopeful film. I got it with Whale Rider. HOPE is the operative word. I'm reminded of Bloom County's dandelion break - remember the cartoon strip? - WR was the best dandelion break I've had in years!<BR>The film is quite different than Witi's book, but very dramatic all the same.  Especially interesting were the cultural scenes of the Maori. I found their tribal hall fascinating. The singing scenes were also haunting. What beautiful rituals!<BR>Keisha Castle-Hughes was a wonder in front of the camera. Her debut no less! I was stunned. I have never seen a young performer so comfortable with her emotions. She had such a sense of presence in such a young person, it was almost scary to watch. You couldn't help but feel her despair, happiness, pride. She was so on, so believable! She will be a breakout star.  All the cast members were also great. The ensemble cast worked seamlessly together. I fervently hope this film does well at the awards - then maybe someone will make more like this. The soundtrack CD is also good!<BR>I can't say enough about this film without sounding like a blithering idiot. GO SEE IT, in the theater is best, but if not, on DVD or Video. Just see it! You will come away with a hopeful wish for all life.
B000002KO1|5.0|When i heard this for the first time... it was something of a life-changing event.  I had liked some new wave music, but was mostly a Led Zeppelin chick - smoking pot with my friends and pondering Jim Morrison's poetry on Doors albums.<br />Then... THIS ALBUM... wow!  From the instant &quot;Precious&quot; starts with the drumsticks clicking and then...  Chrissie sings... and you're not exactly sure WHAT she's saying, but you just know she is the coolest girl singer in many years.  Combining a mix of Shangri-La's tuff-girl with some Dusty Springfield soul, not to mention some bad-ass Keith Richards looks - how could you lose with Chrissie as your lead singer?<br />The interesting thing is that even though I was born and raised in the USA, I learned this album's lyrics from copying the sounds she makes and didn't know some of them actually HAD lyrics for years.  Who cares?  Now that i DO know the lyrics, it seems I'm quoting them ALL the time.  &quot;Howard the Duck and Mr Stress both stayed trapped in a world that they never made - But not me baby, i'm too precious i had to f#@% off!&quot; - &quot;I said, Baby, oh, sweetheart&quot; - &quot;It was all very run of the mill&quot; - &quot;I was a good time, yeah, i got pretty good&quot; - &quot;stop snivelin' - you're gonna make some plastic surgeon a rich man!&quot; - &quot;i'm very superficial i hate anything official&quot; - &quot;all of the birds start to sing everytime babies dream&quot; - &quot;you know me - i love pretending&quot;<br />I think i've bought about 4 copies over the years... don't cheese out and ONLY get the Singles collection!  :)<br />If you buy this album, you, too, can find out what the Wait is all about.<br />And remember - PLAY IT LOUD
B000002JSN|5.0|Led Zeppelin is the best rock and roll band ever, and this may just be their best album. I own several (but not all) of their CD's and I think this one takes the cake because of the first disc. It includes some of the best Zeppelin songs, and also some that aren't particularly famous but are very good, like &quot;The Rover&quot; and &quot;In My Time of Dying,&quot; which features some incredible guitar playing by Jimmy Page. Check out the Led Zeppelin DVD for a live performance of this song!
B0000C6E4D|3.0|When I listened to this CD the first time, I was actually kind of disappointed. In the past, Sarah has had very mellow melodies, not this pop sounding stuff. I don't really know how to explain it but there was a couple of awesome songs on this CD. Good Job

B00000J6AG|3.0|You know what you like but don't know if you'll like this album. As far as mainstream music goes, bands 3, 4, and 5 (conveniently provided for your listening pleasure here on Amazon) set the bar for this album. They are reminiscent of Enigma: driving beats, unintelligible lyrics, and kind of fun. But these represent only one style on the album which, especially toward the back end, has an experimental feel. For example, the album sets traditional music (in this case, blues) to a beat, similar to Enigma's treatment of Gregorian and Indian chants. There's hip-hop and a track with acoustic guitar. At one point, Moby (I assume) reads poetry to music while standing too close to the mike and turning pages. Some tracks are just tunes in a loop and very short. You will either find this a wonderful patchwork of creativity or an annoying mish-mash of sound bites. My copy is up for sale. I kept Enigma.

B00005Q66T|5.0|This cd is a great introduction into the last decades' worth of music from the most famous woman in the record industry.  Sure it has sloppy edits and the running order makes no sense, but everyone has their own version of Madonna's greatest hits.  Madonna is more than a singer.  She actually writes and produces her own music, unlike other big names in the music industry.  She has truly earned her title as the Queen of Pop through hard work.  It is all reflective in the songs represented her, and why this diva has staying power.  True, it is missing some hits and singles released, but so did The Immaculate Collection(remember true blue, who's that girl?, dress you up, etc.), and nobody ever complains about that album.  Madonna could easily milk her fans with a double disc replacement of both her greatest hits, but instead has offered us a sampler of her favourites.  I mean, they're her damn songs, let her choose them as she wants. So hats off, and let's hope we get to see a GHV3.
B0000203Y5|3.0|A fairly enjoyable musical travelogue -- saved mostly by the high quality of the music itself -- but I expected more. Wenders treats everything kind of superficially -- each musician gets to say about a paragraph about his/her life and music on camera. Ibrahim Ferrer, the defacto star of the movie, gets a bit more face time, but he seems like such a fascinating character and I don't really feel that the audience gets to know him. <br />The movie needs a story, a thread going all the way through. We know that Cooder rediscovered some of these guys, and that there used to be this Buena Vista Social Club, but we don't get a good sense of it. What history there is is usually done in voice over, often with music playing at the same time, so it's hard to take in the information. <br />Cooder gets annoying sometimes as well -- his guitar style doesn't always fit in, and there's something irritating and a condescending about the way he relates to the other musicians.<br />Still, worth seeing, especially in the US, where we rarely get a good look at Cuban life.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|It's no mistake that, since she began taking part in the songwriting, the sales have slipped. She absolutely is NOT talented in any way shape or form. She doesn't sing as much as coo seductively. All we want from her is a photo spread, and every record she puts out is simply a way of putting off her ultimate fate as a centerfold.

0440217563|5.0|Wonderful book series.  Diana Gabaldon is such a wonderful writer, I got sucked into these stories, the characters became my friends.  After you finish the series you will want to turn around and read the whole thing again immediatly.  If you are buying these books, you might as well buy two copies of each one.  One to keep and one to share with all of your friends, and believe me, you will want all of your friends to read about Jamie and Claire.  I highly recommend these books, I can't say enough about this series, just wonderful.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I can't say I've ever wrote a review. Or gone crazy for a TV show or DVD before: but If I must this is it! I never saw the show as it aired, or even heard of it. I saw the first disk as a rental at my local video store, and picked it up as a lark and was stunned. It had a great plot, wonderful story, a cast that that seemed to love being there, and sharing it with you. There was only one problem the rest of the disks where out.. Order it from Amazon!<br /><br />I bought the rest of series sight unseen, I was quite pleased and <BR>depressed.. You see it was a great show, a classic show, but it was gone already.It was like falling in love with a movie star from the fifties, or a author who has passed away.<br /><br />Brilliant but gone, a bitter sweet thing that was not looked<BR>for, found and then lost. Before you could stand up and be counted. It was gone.<br /><br />Buy it, enjoy that fact that this was someones loved one, and rejoice it existed.<br /><br />I loved it I hope you will too.
B00005JLPK|4.0|Bringing art to life is always tricky, but this film frames the artist Frida Kahlo perfectly.  <br />Selma Hayek is superb, her heart and sole in every scene and blending with Alfred Molina's portrayal of Diego Rivera, the Mexican muralist.  Seen through the eyes of others, Rivera's personality comes through but never distracts, only adds to the story of his wife, Frida.  <br />I had a few questions at the end, but rather than being frustrated, I wanted to see the film again...Always a good sign.<br />
0385335482|5.0|Poor Rebecca Bloomwood. She's twenty-five years old, and she has what most people her age would love. She lives in a trendy flat in London, has the most glamorous of wardrobes, and many socialite friends. But there is one major problem. Rebecca really cannot afford any of this posh lifestyle at all. She's in debt up to her eyeballs with her credit cards; and it only gets worse. Her job as a journalist doesn't really pay all that much, and anyway, the job bores her too death. The only thing that really makes her happy is shopping all the time. She tries to cut back, but it never works.<br />An event happens in her life that will soon change everything. It has to, for the bank is after her for her overdraft, and the credit card companies are on her case as well eventually for her unpaid bills. <br />The new job event will change things, at least for awhile. Rebecca will soon have to wake up and manage her finances.<br />I enjoyed every chapter of this book, and it had me laughing the whole time.
0446677450|5.0|i picked up this book about 4 years ago...when i was just a young freshman in college...after reading this first time, i started becoming more interested in creating businesses and investing...<br />sure, there were tons of books out there for me to search...but that's part of the journey of becoming rich...you must first learn the secrets and seek to seek more until you know exactly what you want and how to get there...<br />rich dad poor dad will not give you the specific details...it is not a one-stop guide to riches...it won't give you anything really specific...but it will encourage you to start thinking in the right perspective...the specifics are all up to you...<br />just like robert kiyosaki said, i'd rather die working to get rich than to work all my life for a company for 25 years and become a poor man...you will come to realize that having a \\"safe and secure job\\" is not SAFE at all in this time of age!  This is the information age!  It is not the industrial age anymore and so many people i talk to don't know this or just don't get it.  <br />I know people who think they're rich just because they work for a great company and make a big salary...that doesn't mean anything!  Their money (just like the masses) depends on the system...what rich dad and robert kiyosaki ultimately teaches in the most GENERAL and BASIC way is that you must create your own system...<br />this book can be helpful for the masses but from what i have seen, it really comes down to your own personal choice...many people seem to not want to build businesses...but rather keep seeking for the \\"hot\\" jobs...keep seeking for employers...keep sending out their resumes...keep going out for interviews competing with other struggling average americans...this is not the way to become rich...the true secret is to build your own business because it is the information age now...<br />simple as that...simple but not easy...this book lacks specifics but that it ultimately up to you...i have listenedto lots of RK's tapes and read his other book \\"Cashflow Quadrant\\"...and i honestly think that Robert Kiyosaki is not the smartest guy in the world...he seems pretty lazy and average but he thinks like the RICH...he has the mindset of a RICH man...<br />the thing is, you can be LAZY and still be RICH because of the power of LEVERAGE in businesses and assets...after 4 years, i've created an online business where i have created money out of nothing...yes, i accumulated up to $10,000 in profits...where i invested NOTHING!!!  will i tell you the specifics?  Of course not!  That is part of capitalism...if you pay me $1 billion, i still wouldn't...maybe i would...but you get my point...<br />the price of information is priceless if you choose to use that information...i bought this rich dad book for like 20 bucks 4 years ago...and because of that, i am now on my way of becoming rich for the rest of my life...through building money out of nothing and creating businesses...and i know it's not a instant journey...it's a lifetime journey...but it's exciting...you control your destiny...not some employer telling you to do work that you ultimately don't really care about...<br />when it comes down to it, you either follow your own plan or you follow someone else's plan...the sad reality is that 90% of people in our schools are taught to follow someone else's plan...<br />this one book will not chagne your life...most likely...it can though...i encourage you to pick this book up and read it and really reflect and study its philosophy...question your old beliefs about money and about being rich...<br />do some seeking...some searching...find out your passions...find out what you are good at...know yourself...and then the next step is to read rich dad poor dad...<br />Best of luck...<br />BJ Min
B00009V8Z9|5.0|this record is brilliant. gavin degraw is an incredible talent that outshines all in the industry today. with tracks like &quot;over rated&quot;, &quot;i dont want to be&quot;, &quot;belief&quot; &amp; &quot;just friends&quot; he proves that he is an amazing talent. &quot;follow through&quot;, &quot;chariot&quot; &amp; &quot;crush&quot; are all fantastic as well. there isn't a song on here that i dont like. his soft rock/pop album is quite possibly the best record i ever heard/own. his voice is tremendous. i really like this one.

B0000584V3|5.0|First of, great album, I love it. It's a great album to get into Opeth if you haven't heard much of Opeth before or haven't gotten used to death metal vocals or deth metal in general.<BR>Example is Drapery Falls, it features all of Opeth's elements.<BR>About the album it self, it's pounding and heavy but also very beautiful. This is the album that put Opeth on the map and there is a reason, check it out, definately worth the money.
B000002LQR|5.0|If I could only choose one word for this album, it would be BRILLIANCE.<br />The Chili Peppers are a muscial all-star team. Chad Smith is easily one of the most underrated drummers of the 90s. He never skips or misses a beat, and is content to play second fiddle to the outstanding Flea and Frusciante, but can step it up when he is needed.<br />Flea........you can't say a whole lot about him that has not been said before. The guy is outstanding. The bass line on every one of these songs is great; the end of &quot;Under the Bridge&quot; is his shining moment to me, and it is excellent.<br />Though Frusciante left the band in 1992 and failed in his solo career, he is still easily one of the best guitar players of our era. He can do it all. There's a reason why Rolling Stone had him in the top 20 of guitar players all-time. I absolutely loved his solo to begin The Greeting Song.<br />Kiedis amazes me still to this day. He is lively, energetic, and active, always ready to belt it out or go low-key. A beautiful voice.<br />Combine the four together, and you have the pinnacle of music in the 1990s. This is the best CD of the decade to me. You have Under the Bridge, an unquestioned masterpiece. There is also Give It Away, another track that helped this CD go platinum 7 times. Let's not forget Power of Equality (underrated in my opinion; Kiedies shines in this track), Righteous and the Wicked, Suck My Kiss, Naked in the Rain, My Lovely Man....so much to love about this.<br />Californication is close, and By the Way is also great, but this is what made RHCP's career, and for good reason. 20 years and still going strong. I can't wait for the next release!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Everyone else has given the 20 second history of Firefly, so I'll skip that.  What I will say is that Firefly is a fantastic series - in 14 episodes, it stands apart from all other Sci-Fi shows.  Where other shows have larger-than-life heroes and villans, Firefly has real people (and the occassional evil guys).  It's about life, in space, but life nonetheless.<br />Give Firefly a try - the series itself, prior to the DVD set, is amazing - it tugs at the heartstrings and gives the viewer the full range of emotions.  Add in the DVD special features - commentary from the directors, series creator, cast and crew which is often jovial and informative, plus the special features and you have a class-act DVD.  It's great for anyone in your life who loves Sci-Fi, Westerns, or just an amazing series.<br />Keep on flying, Firefly.

B00008PW2D|1.0|I am a HUGE fan of Sex and the City... I own the first four seasons and watch them all the time! But when I found out the the fifth season only had 8 episodes and cost the same amount as all the others... I was shocked! There is no way I would ever pay that much for such a small amount of episodes. I'm patiently waiting for the price to go down to at least [$] if it doesn't get lowered, I won't buy it, which makes me so sad. :( But I still love the show!!! :)
0471413909|5.0|... or maybe s/he simply didn't understand what s/he read.  I'm talking about the one that made the stupid statement about the lifespan of paleo humans being only 30 years.  Cordain's research shows that if the paleo human was able to avoid childhood mortality and accident, he or she was typically a healthy and productive member of the tribe well into the 60's or 70's, and that the agricultural 'revolution' substantially shortened the human lifespan.  Skeletal remains of elderly paleo humans are common -- plus they don't usually show signs of degenerative diseases (or even crooked teeth).  Both Cordain and Audette make this observation, so I'm assuming the reviewer simply relied on what somebody else said about the book when writing the 'review'.<br />Cordain's diet recommendations have two big plusses: 1) they make sense, and 2) they are simple enough for anybody (except maybe the 'reviewer' in question) to understand and implement.<br />In addition to this book, I recommend Ray Audette's NeanderThin.
B000002J2B|5.0|This is the album that should be on every prog rock fan's shelf. It starts off very strong with 'Eleventh Earl Of Mar' then just when you thought it couldn't get any better, it does with 'One For The Vine' - my personal favourite Genesis song - a prog rock anthem that seems to get better and better with each listen. <BR>Their wonderful sense of humour is explored in great delight on a couple of tracks as well: 'All In A Mouse's Night', and Wot Gorilla? Both reflect how this band doesn't always have to take itself seriously - as so many other bands do - and consequently get caught up in their own self importance.<BR>'Blood On The Rooftops' is a wonderful song where the band takes on what comprises accepted values and what society accepts as the norm. It's a song about how the nightly news which comes into our homes via televison (ie: the antennas that pick up the signals on the rooftops) leaves a trail of blood on our rooftops and in our everyday lives. The message here is that we rarely get any good news anymore - it's one story after another of the ills of society. A message that seems even more evident and relevant today than it was in 1976 when this album first was released on store shelves.<BR>All in all this is a very strong, etremely well written album from start to finish - but even in all its strength, it is not without its tender moments as well, with the marvelous 'Your Own Special Way'. I highly recommend this album to anyone, Genesis fan or not.<br />I find it amazing how an album 28 years old can still sound fresh and exciting as the day it was released so many years ago - but somehow this album does just that. All the while it speaks to us of another time - when the music always came first - and image wasn't important at all.<BR>If you haven't had the pleasure...what are you waiting for?
B000067DNC|5.0|Stargate seems to be of the hit or miss, love it or hate it variety.  Well, I love it, baby!  The intiresting plotline which threads through each of the seasons is intriguing and fun at the same time.  Combined with the great acting of Richard Dean Anderson, Michael Shanks, Christopher Judge, Amanda Tapping, etc, this season exemplifies some of the finest episodes yet put together.
0609610570|5.0|This book reminds the leaders of the corporate world a long forgotten truth about their job...the art of getting things done...and get them done right.
B000002WU9|5.0|This album is the f*ckin sh*t...If you are a WC fan then this cd is a must.  Every track on this album shine, but Guillotine and Verbal Intercourse are my favorites.  Nas gets on the track on verbal intercourse and opens the song up by killin the mic letting Chef and Ghost finish it off with flawless flows.  This cd is too much to put into words.  Every track rules and as much as Nas- Illmatic, BIG- Ready to Die, and 2pac- Me against the World sets the blueprint of Hip Hop, this CD is just as important to me as the rest of these rap poet legends.  Get yourself this cd like you should have &quot;got yo'self a gun&quot;.  Chef drops the best solo Wu tang album out there with Ghostface as his sidekick emcee who without a doubt rocks the mic...and Chef remains the member who was ahead of his time just as BIG was in New York with rhyme after rhyme killin mics.
0780622553|4.0|This 1998 movie starring Keifer Sutherland, Rufus Sewell, Jennifer Conelly and some other people I don't remember is a great movie.  It is one of those movies you see where you need to watch it with an open mind.  Because that is the best way to enjoy it.  It might be hard to grasp for some but for fans of Science Fiction movies this movie is one of the best Sci Fi movies in recent memory.  I think this movie will remind some of the Matrix for how it questions reality. Also if you are expecting action galore, then you are in for a suprise because there is very little action but the plot is very rich.<br />The DVD has some nice special features and the menus are nicely animated.  This is a DVD that was released in 2001 (doesn't seem that long ago) and it holds up good with its features and the flashy menus of DVD's you see out today.<br />Keifer Sutherland gives a great performance as his portrayal of the doctor and the ending to this movie is one that will not be forgotten.  It isn't the Keifer Sutherland you've come to know from 24 as the hard as nails Jack Bauer.  But none the less it is a great role for him.  The other actors fill in nicely also.  My only gripe with this movie is that it didn't really seem too long.<br />To conclude, check out this movie if you are a science fiction fan or a Keifer Sutherland fan.  I know it has a decent following but I find it to be very underrated and I think it will be a greater cult classic in time.
B000092Q4U|5.0|This album is so insanely intense!  From start to finish it just it is an all-out assault.  The production is 10X what it was for New American Gospel, which helps.  Randy's vocals are so unrelenting.  Granted, there is very little variation in his style, but there really is no need for it on this record.  It fits the vibe that they were going for.  The band back him up with music that bashes your skull into the pavement and leaves you begging for more!  My personal favorites here are:  Ruin, 11th Hour, Vigil, and For Your Malice.  If you get the chance to see these guys live, take it!  They are one the best live acts I've seen to date, period.  If you are looking for a metal band that plays metal the way it should be, look no further...Lamb of God is it.
B00000JCOV|5.0|this is a great cd. it is their best yet. the madness is just great. you cant go wrong with this cd.
B000003EUL|4.0|This is a classic among classics. I love Richter's Brahms for the bold, majestic and passionate reading. But if you really want to split hairs, the people who love this recording still must listen to Gina Bachauer with Antal Dorati (on Chesky) and Wilhelm Backhaus with Karl Bohm (on Decca) to realize that Richter's version is not the last word. Take piano tone, Richter is no where near as full bodied as Backhaus. Even Backhaus's phrasing is superior. Taken at a slightly slower pace, Bohm's terrific conducting also add's to the excitement. just to prove my point, play the introduction of Richter's recording and play Backhaus. You'd have to be deaf not to notice the difference of phrasing and touch. The same can be said for Bachauer. The feminine touch is a huge asset to Brahms. Not nearly as masculine as Backhaus, nor too light, but instead, songful and precise. Not to mention, Doati's strings from the Royal Philharmonic sound better than what Leinsdorf or Bohm illicit from their respective orchestra's. Having said all this, you may think I don't enjoy Richter's recording, I do, but I feel that many listeners often place this recording so far up the charts, they are not aware there are some great recordings that sometime surpass the favorites. The Beethoven is another matter. That introduction is taken with such speed, strength and virtuosity, it's almost amazing that Richter can pull it off an convincingly as I do. After hearing Richter, it's really difficult to hear the others, despite some stiff competition from Backhaus (a great recording on Decca) and Horowitz (on Sony.) But this is just my opinion. You may like your Beethoven more gentle and not as aggressive. Yes, I agree that it's appropriate for some of the other sonatas, but Richter's version is the one to own.
B000006045|5.0|The album that was heavily criticized upon it first release back in 1998, is now regarded as a modern Classic. ...This may be due to it undoubtedly being the gloomiest &amp; most claustrophobic album Massive Attack had ever under taken. This was an album that had far more in common with the deep paranoia of Massive Attack Collaborator \\"Tricky's\\" menacing &amp; Broodingly eerie sound. Out went the synthesizers &amp; Piano glossy female vocals...and in came the Fuzzy tone guitars &amp; Tribal Drums, scratchy / static laded samples and creators \\"3D\\" &amp; \\"Daddy G\\" giving subversive aggressive vocal talents. And it's when listening to tracks such as \\"Angel / Risingson / Black Milk &amp; Mezzanine\\" with their incredibly emotional charged Dark content, that it's amazing that the genius contained within this album, wasn't picked up upon the first time around when this album was released...undeniably Massive Attacks most disturbing record, and in `Some' quarters...regarded as their best!!??
B000089RVX|5.0|I didn't feel like revealing this album because everything there is to this album has been said, and still saying! But still found myself here to give a piece of my mind. I give it 5 stars because it is indeed a groundbreaker to mainstream music. This is an album which you don't come often across at -- it combines all the element of eeriness, dark, epical, dramatic, etc. and at the same time giving us a tunnel of light and bittersweet hope.  I haven't even heard the 1st single 'Bring me to Life', this album had been in my possession. Why? Perhaps it lured me into it's style and genre which was really what I'd always looking for - music that embrace darkness, without any trace of evil... - it's not really one of those album that induces you into depression or even suiside...it speaks about how ordinary and beautiful it could be if we acknowledge pain &amp; suffering as part of life, and help us to grow.  I believe this album is a journey of its own kind, not really alike Linkin Park at all, as perceived!  Explore the lyrics &amp; how the songs are delivered, then you'll see a different angle of negativity in whole new light. It's quite spiritually nourishing!
B000058983|5.0|Unarguably an Highly influential album, that wasn't a commercial success..With It's effects still being felt even today amongst certain Folk/Rock musician circles. It's album as much as ahead of it's time, as it was the unlikely paring of 'Folk' & 'Rock' under the one roof. \\"Andmoreagain\\" eschews heavy guitar, for tempered acoustic & wistful violins, sounding like pared-down country-rock. \\"Bumming in the Summer\\" is psychedelic rock the way 'Jimmy Hendrix' would envisage, with attitude to spare, spiky Guitar solos and so very nearly as Vital as Jimmy's work. But the real calling card, for which continues to seduce new listeners is the acoustic guitar, brass horn, spaghetti Western-esque stomping of \\"Alone Again or\\", with singer \\"Arthur Lee\\" theoretically taking 'No Prisoner's' with the bands forever eternal calling card.  If you're thinking of picking this album up anytime soon (As I did several months ago), remember that its roots are as much entrenched in Folk sensibilities as it is in psychedelic rock (with the variety of psychedelic, blues, Jazz & flamenco influences running strongly throughout the album), and you'll see why its still as relevant a foot note in music now, as it was back then.....exceptional.
B00005AQF7|5.0|Snoop's first (and I am just about sure  the  best selling) album. It is a masterpeice. Came out in the '93's and sold very well. Later Snoop did his 2nd album \\"Tha Doggfather\\" Once again, sold very well. Snoop was big, a real big rapper, like he still is this day, and always will be. On this album, CLASSIC song \\"Who Am I? (What's My Name)?\\" makes it's way to track 8, as one of the greatest hits on this album. Other hits include \\"Gin & Juice\\" \\"Ain't No Fun\\" \\"Doggy Dogg World\\" and some more but those are enough for you to get the idea that Snoop Dogg is such a great rapper. I mean, almost every song on this is a hit. That is why it sold so well. Mabey (but not sure) but just mabey, might of sold better than Dr. Dre's \\"The Chronic\\" I don't think so.... but just mabey. Track 6 \\"Murder Was The Case\\" didn't make it's way to a hit like it's remix did. But is still an awesome song. I think that the normal is better actually! \\"Tha Shiznit\\" is another very popular track. All are great though. Dre wasn't a guest really on this, which I was hoping to see. Dre and Snoop are good friends. On different Snoop Albums, and Dre albums, they sing ALOT together. I was watching on TV once that Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre sold an album together,in which they both made it. I have never seen it in real life, but on TV. Because once I tried to buy it, and I went to 7 different CD stores, but none of those I found this album. It must either be all sold out, or very rare. There are some things I have been wondering about snoop dogg and his changes. One is, this, and Tha Doggfather, his two oldest ones, he never said \\"FoShizzle\\" or \\"Fizzle\\" But from all of his new stuff, he says it alot. Was that a new line? I thought it was from the old snoop. I heard him say some thing like \\"Trizzey\\" but never foshizzle. huh. Another thing is, he sold a good two albums with Suge Knight's Death Row records. But in snoop's song Pimp Slapp'd, he all says bad stuff about Suge Knight and the record label. I do not getit. Well anyway, this is an awesome album. Awesome beats. But I think i need to shut up now. Bye the way, if you don't have this, then buy it now! This album really starts the perfect CD collection!! 10 out of 10! more awesome Snoop albums to come!<br />~ Makaveli tha don
B0000048CX|5.0|Firstly It should be noted that this album isn't the usual collection of bittersweet, Autumnal wry Indie Rock &amp; Alternative Pop/Rock songs that the band are usually famed(&amp; applauded) for. That is a markedly radical one off change in direction for the band, instead choosing to focus on obscure covers songs, leaning toward Alt.Country-rock, (the country-esque \\"Can't forget/Griselda &amp; Here comes my baby\\"), all subtly reflective &amp; imitate. Before Stopping to include the 60's rock &amp; roll of \\"Emulsified\\" (curiously soundly like rock &amp; roll rocker \\"Monster Mash\\"), before heading down the indie rock that they earned their musical stripes for (\\"Speeding Motorcycle/The Summer/Did I tell you). Impeccably paced (The transitions from country/Americana tracks to Alternative/Indie rock is seamless), and It's nigh on impossible not to nod (or even sing) along to what's being played here, and a superbly focused diversion for Yo La Tengo. And more Distressingly a direction that band chose not to the further explore.  So, with the vast majority of fantastic Yo la tengo albums leaning more towards focused Alternative / Indie Rock, this was a beautifully realised deviation for the band.
B00005OAA6|5.0|I love Victoria (aka Posh Spice), she was always one of my favorites!  After this album, I truly love it!  I got as a gift, but it was a download.  I've been searching every store in my local area, but never found it.  I am on a mission to find it!  Some of the songs on the downloaded one are different, but some songs are the same, and I will review them!<br />1. This Groove- Really good songs.

Unconditional Love- Rarely listen to it, but great!!<br />   All in all great album + I am still waiting for her to release that single in the U.S. + come to it!
B00013F35I|5.0|I caught this tour live in 2002, and I saw the Born in the USA tour back in '84. This performance captures the memories of both. <br />A note to buyers who have technical difficulties with either disc: Call the number on the back of the DVD case and tell Sony. I called to report a problem with the menu on disc 2, which appears to be a common problem in some batches, and my replacement disc arrived less than a week later.
0375432302|5.0|Not only does this book present valuable theories on the subject of Christianity and the Holy Grail, but it is also an amazing piece of fictional writing.

Stayed up all night and late into the morning to finish it at the expense of a couple missed meetings ;)<br />Seriously, though, I'm a novice on Grail theory and know just enough to recognize the basic ideas presented and I found this book enlightening enough on the topic to teach, yet fascinating enough as an adventure to read through and not question the validity of the theories as fact.<br />Amazing. Would (and have) recommend it to anyone.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|If you read my review of &quot;Is This It,&quot; you know that I adore the Strokes. You also know that I waited much longer than normal to get this CD for fear of dissapointment. And I was dissapointed. In fact, the first time I listened to it, I thought &quot;Room on Fire&quot; was terrible. I couldn't believe that my beloved Strokes' new album was bad. So I listened to it again.<BR>I think after the intial shock wore off, I began to like this CD. I don't care what anybody says, this is nothing like their debut album. &quot;Is This It&quot; was nearly perfect. &quot;Room on Fire&quot; is definantly a bit different. The most noticable difference is a darker sound. While most of &quot;Is This It&quot; gave you the feeling that Julian Casablancas didn't give a damn, there were some upbeat, almost happy songs. While Casablancas still has the same unemotional, detached style on some songs, there's a lot more emotion to &quot;Room On Fire.&quot; He sounds like he actually cares what he's saying, and everything's not so good anymore. It's different, but once you get over the initial shock of the album not being filled with songs that make you feel like nothing in the world matters, it is enjoyable. It is still obviously The Strokes, and although the changes are subtle, they may dissapoint a bit the first time around.
0385504209|5.0|Well....Now that I've read this book AND &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot; I have one complaint: All the other books I now read for excitment and suspense just plain....suck! I cannot wait for Mr. Brown's next book. This book, although maybe not &quot;Gospel Truth&quot; does shed light on many aspects of the Christian faith, especially the place, or lack thereof, of women in the church. I could not put down this book, and dare I say it, I was even more enthralled by &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot;
B00008PW2D|3.0|OK, This is a TV show.  EN-TER-TAIN-MENT.  How deep does it have to be???  I'm always so anxious for the next season of SATC to be released, especially since I haven't had HBO for a couple of years now, but I hesitated this year due to the reviews here.  I wish there were more than 8 episodes, but there aren't.  I wish the girls weren't aging, but I also wish I wasn't.  I decided since I had paid full price for Season 1 back in the day (I was thrilled to do so) that I could fork over the money for this short season.  I wanted to see what you all were talking about and to have a complete set of the series, of course.  So, five months earlier than usual, I picked up the latest season... (for $10 less than I paid for short season 1)  I guess you see where I'm going here.  I'm a fan, I bought it.  I say if you're even considering buying Season Five, then you're a fan and probably own the first four seasons.  Go on and get it.  You know you want to, just like me.  I will say that some of the material seemed much cornier than usual to me, but I truly wonder how much of that was due to my being influenced by some of these reviews. There were some great moments too, and I watched the final episode twice in a row (2nd time with director's commentary). Basically, it's four hours of entertainment for about the same price as two movies.  Not that bad, really.  Lighten up and enjoy!!
B000069AUI|5.0|Until recently I have enjoyed Coldplay's music from a distance, listening to the radio tracks, watching the videos. I generally listen to different music genres, but Coldplay's music shines through and is deserving of the vast musical audience it has gained. I bought \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" (2002) a few weeks ago and have been enjoying it ever since. With almost 800 reviews written on the album, theres not much if anything to expand on. The singles \\"In My Place\\", \\"The Scientist\\"and \\"Clocks\\" are excellent. I like the fastpaced \\"Daylight\\" and \\"Warning Sign\\" goes deep. The opening and ending tracks, \\"Politik\\" and \\"Amsterdam\\" are two more of my favourites. This is one of those albums, I can listen to and enjoy through and through at any time of the day. The variety of sounds Coldplay provide are addictive, and Chris Martin's soulful vocals are impressive. Albums like this make me appreciate other music genres, definitely one for the collection.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Fiona Apple's sophmore album &quot;When the pawn. . .&quot; sounds more like a lifetime achievement record compared to most singer/songwriters that have been doing this for a long time. I am sooooo glad to see that after 4 1/2 years later this album is still a favorite to avid music listeners. Fiona's album was a complete overlook to the grammy's (not that it really matters I mean you see what those idiots nominate however there are rare exceptions). &quot;When the pawn. . .&quot; would have literally blown the competition out of the water. Why? I am being so serious. This album is really really really really really good! It's amazing! It's lovely! It's better thatn you think! Buy it! Support real artists!<BR>Sorry, I'm just really going through withdraw from not hearing anything else from this talented young girl. COME BACK FIONA!!! WE LOVE YOU!!
B00006JLX4|5.0|A watermark in lo-fi alt-rock history, &quot;Slanted and Enchanted&quot; has recently been reissued in a &quot;Luxe and Reduxe&quot; edition.  Now spanning 2 packed CDs, the flaws of the original album have been supplanted by a wealth of fine bonus material, culminating in a full live show that previews 'Box Elder' from &quot;Crooked Rain Crooked Rain&quot;.  Fans of this album may already have scoffed at my characterization of this album as flawed, but objectively speaking there are a few songs that meander aimlessly ('Chesley's Little Wrists', 'Fame Throwa') and the record is littered with horrid dadaesque lyrics.  For instance, the morose strains of 'Here' (one of the album's better tracks) are irrevocably marred by such juvenilia as 'I'm the only one who laughs/at your jokes when they are so bad/And your jokes are always bad/but they're not as bad as this'.  I can handle some of the purely nonsensical lyrics but tripe such as the above only make me feel embarrassed to like the song in the first place.  But on a positive note, 'Summer Babe' and 'In the Mouth a Desert' are some of the greatest modern rock songs ever recorded, and the addition of the Peel Sessions, album era EPs and live show only up the value of this package (an accompanying booklet offers plenty of reading material but the band members are too blase about their achievements to offer much real historical insight).  All-in-all a must have, and it'll be interesting to see what Matador does with the rest of Pavement's discography considering how many EPs and scattered rarities the band have recorded over the ages
B0000020C4|5.0|This is the best version out there. I have listened to parts of each one and this surpasses the others. If you are only buying one version this is it. All the cast do a great job.<br />Positives- Valjean (Colm Wilkenson) is great his range is strong and clear. Fantine (Ruthie Henshall) is my favorite character, she has so much emotion in her voice and Come to Me and I Dreamed a Dream have brought me to tears. I could keep going through everyone (except judy Kuhn-Cosette) in the cast because they all did so great. Gavroche (Adam Searles) is a doll he did great and had a passion for being in character. The Thenediers are performed perfectly. O and I cannot forget Lea Salonga she is WONDERFUL!!! I cry everytime I hear A Little Fall of Rain. You actually believe she is dying her voice is so clean in On Your Own but she adds a slight tremble to A little fall of rain.<br />Negative- I did not like Judy Kuhn at all her voice was not at all what I pictured Cosette being like. Also her pics make me positive apalled she is a beautiful women but does not have to youth to play Cosette. Also in Castle on a Cloud which was BEAUTIFULLY performed by Hannah Chick a balloon pops from the ceiling that was full of balloons for after the finale in the middle of a word. It is a slight destraction but Hannah did not miss a note and although in the movie you see she is shaken you would never know anywhere else.<br />Buy this CD and you will not be disapointed. It is awesome and if you love Les Mis then it is for you...Also Consider buying the movie which is great because the cast are in full costume and even with the lack of props they show so much emotion. This is a British musical that is not dependent on a stage set!!!
0679879269|3.0|This is LIKE a spoiler page, but i kept some things hidden, such as the things that are most important, so i may give away something you dont want to know about. In any case, they will have names attached so you may just skip down.<br />THESE ARE MY OPINIONS<BR>first of all, id like to begin by saying that i loved the first and second books to no end. They were wonderful. <br />secondly, i thought this book was not as good because I really like Ms. Coulter and what happens to her at the end made me want to stop reading altogether. next to this I want to talk about the deaths. I think too many people died here, and I am one for happy endings.<br />thirdly, I dont think they make it very clear about what Lyra has to do just as Eve. I think this was very misleading because they say that Mary Malone will be a temptress, and you're waiting for her to be tempted but it never happens. <br />THIS BOOK Is VERY SAD IN THE END, which made me think differently of it.<br />THIS IS WHAT THE BOOK IS ABOUT<br />well, this is really about Lyra doing what she is guided to do to help other people. She will face many obstacles, but she sees that a lot of people are on her side. She is going to give many people happiness, but will not gain as much for herself. She will come to love someone as her soul mate, and loose someone as her greatest friend(This will\may change later on). <br />mary will do whatever she wants to do, basically. Lord Asriel and Ms. Coulter will come together in two ways you would never dream of(which one of these that i mentioned earlier, i did not like). The other one is their deep love of Lyra, which was great, but would have been better if Lyra knew about it.
B000127LW2|3.0|I have the same complaint about Voyage most folks have; the first season had some interesting episodes but $100.00 for 16 episodes seems a bit steep. The writing during season one took a dive about midway through the show. I stuck with it through season 5 and intermittantly caught season 6. I hate to say it but unless nothing else was on, I pretty much had given up by the conclusion of the series.<br />The concept isn't bad nor are the actors. It's the execution that's wanting. Trek had fallen into a formula and that formula, despite interesting story arcs, made the series predictable. The best acting in the world and the best optical effects can't save a show suffering from predictability syndrome.<br />Now if they had killed characters off and taken more risks after season three, the series might have held my attention.
B00006F83Y|4.0|Let me start off with telling you about my first listening to any of QOTSA. One of the rarest things that I do anymore, watch some kind of music TV station, I was flipping through and heard &quot;No One Knows&quot;. I thought that it was total repetative garbage, and someone needs to take it out, for the sake of all of us. Much later on in this same year, I purchased the newest Cky film, &quot;Cky4&quot;. During the intro they played a heart-pumping, heavy sound song. I instantly fell in live with this song, and searched all over the web until on the Cky Forums site, I found the answer to my question. QOTSA. I was slightly familiar with the name of the band, and really had forgotten about the song &quot;No One Knows&quot;, so this band was mysterious to me, even though I had heard them before without realizing it. So I go over to Best buy and pick up the CD and started playing it.....WTF?! I thought my stereo was broken once I heard some radio host talking on it. Then my favorite song began. I have grown to love every song on this CD. I had no idea that Dave Grohl was their drummer until my sister told me so. So all of this crap about &quot;hype&quot; is BS. I liked the band before I even knew who they were! All I knew was the song &quot;Millionaire&quot;, and I didn't have a clue who did the song, I got the CD, and had no idea that Grohl was the drummer. I LOVE this CD SO MUCH. The only downfall in my opinion is the radio that goes on before and after some of the songs, it gets old. So I went on Windows Movie Maker and edited it, deleting all of that crap, and now I have myself a perfect score CD, a 5.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A great price for 15 hours of great television.  Also, the sequence on the DVD is far better than the sequence in which it aired on Fox.  The characters are well-developed, the scripts well-acted and the action well paced.  Hopefully, the show will be revived and eventually come back on the big screen.
B000002J09|5.0|Where to begin with this one?  This one passes by so quickly. And I'm honestly not too sure of what to say about Zoso, except that it's feels perfect to me.  It was one of the two Led Zeppelin albums I bought before deciding on taking my &quot;Zeppelin journey&quot;, besides LZ 2.<br />  How do you go about creating an opening riff such as in Black Dog?  Amazing.  There is not one song on this album I do not really enjoy.  Stairway To Heaven is absolutely &quot;stirring&quot;.  I keep thinking of &quot;jungle beat&quot; to describe Four Sticks.  When The Levee Breaks has such ominous power.<br />  I read a review about this album, one where the reviewer gave it 1 star, saying that it was overrated because of it being overplayed on FM radio.  What does that have to do with the reality of Zoso?  Forget FM radio or classic rock stations.  Even if it were the only album played on the radio, that wouldn't take away it's quality.  Try listening to it, and any other Led Zeppelin album, as if you have never heard it before.  Let's not take them for granted.  It's too much of a shame to do that.
0553573403|2.0|I rushed out and bought this book after reading the reviews on this site only to be very disappointed.  A novel is meant to be about somebody and something.  This book changes viewpoint so frequently between a cast of unsympathetic or shallow characters that I could not relate to any of them.<br />Though Martin's writing is well above average for the genre (except for the POV changes), this story is like watching a movie through a strobe light. For mine, Robert Martin's 'shades of grey' book just created a grey cheerless book.  If he'd have written the story, as good novels do, with at least 70-80% of the story through a single character it might have salvaged the novel.  I certainly won't be tracking down book 2.<br />If you're new to fantasy, stick with Tolkien, early Fiest and Eddings, and Tad William's Dragonbone chair series.  Newer authors like Martin and Erikson write unsympathetic characters and the less said about Robert Jordan's never ending story the better.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|As a person who is neutral on Britney (wow - can you actually believe it?), I think I am qualified to give it a straight-up review.  My sense of this whole matter is that diehard Britney fans will always give the album 5 stars, and those who devote their lives and mental energy to hating her, will bash it at any cost.  Well, I have heard the album and I have to say that it is lacking.  It is lacking NOT because she is talentless, because I do think she has talent (another shock?) It's just that she continues to bury the talent with hype and that is unfortunate.  When listening to the album I was struck with the fact that she is probably a very confused young woman who is desperately trying to prove how grown up she is, all the while relying on \\"sexy\\" as the way to get approval.  When you hear it from Kylie who has been making music for about 20 years now and knows herself as a woman, the music is convincing. The problem is, when you hear it from Britney it just sounds like she is trying to prove how comforatble she is - which of course means just the opposite.  I felt a little embarrassed listening to it at times - way too self conscious! Having said that, \\"Against the Music\\" and \\"Toxic\\" are definitely the standout tracks.  \\"Outrageous\\" would be oh-so much better if the lyrics were not so unbeleiveably in-your-face-sex!  A little subtlety goes a long way and can be sexier.  Plus, I've always felt that Britney has relied too much on voice effects and not enough on voice itself.  But I really do think there's a voice (and a woman) in there.  Let's hope she keeps trying and finds both in future albums!
B0000CFW87|5.0|This cd is amazing! Josh Groban has the most beautiful voice I've ever heard and if he doesn't move some part of you, you must be made of stone! My favorite song on this cd is &quot;Si Volvieras A Mi&quot; This song is about a lost love. The title means loosely &quot;Return to me&quot; It's so beautiful and powerful! He sings it with such feeling that you can't help but despair for him!<BR>&quot;Per Te&quot; is another beauty. It means &quot;For You&quot; It's basically a song about how much he loves someone and what he'd do for them to show that love. Josh co-wrote the music for this song and he did a beautiful job. &quot;Mi Mancherai&quot; is the theme from &quot;Il Postino&quot; made into a love song. Joshua Bell plays the violin so beautifully on this song. His part was specifically written for this song and it melts in with Josh's voice so well! &quot;Remember When It Rained&quot; is an original song by the master himself with some help on the music from Eric Mouquet. He also plays piano on the track. There is also a song on here, a duo with Deep Forest called &quot;Never Let Go&quot; It's a great song, kind of slow and electronic sounding. He wrote the words for this song while Eric Mouquet wrote the music. This album definitely shows how much Josh has grown as an artist. It's a beautiful collaboration of music and voice, one that you won't be disappointed in! If you can swing it, you should get the special editions with the extra songs. &quot;Mi Morena&quot; is typically Spanish sounding and beautifully sang in a falsetto voice in certain parts. It's one I find myself repeating over and over. There's also &quot;You're the Only Place&quot; which was barely sung on his PBS special and also sang by Nick Lachey (though Josh does a MUCH better job) That song is so incredible! You can feel the pain of loss as he sings it and you wish for him to reunite with his love again. This cd is so amazingly done, you'll be remiss if you pass up the opportunity to buy it either for yourself or a loved one!
0062502182|2.0|It is amazing that this book has caused such an uproar.  I was told to buy this book by quite a few people who told me it changed their life and how they live it.  So I bought it.    I found it quaint, easy to read and that was about it.      And before anyone gets all excited..yes I got the point of the book...search out your destiny, dare to dream, action is better than inaction, our treasure lies within and so on.      I believe much of that myself...and have been inspired by books with much the same message.  I love fables(ie:  The Little Prince).    I am not a \\"book snob\\".  My reading tastes are all over the map.  All I look for is whether or not the book did what it was trying to do.      \\"The Alchemist\\" did not do that for me.  It left me almost angry.  The boy was a dreamer with no real dream other than \\"treasure\\".  He didn't feel worthy enough to go back for the girl until he found that \\"treasure\\".  He really didn't accomplish anything at all..he just sort of bumped his way into any and all successes or failures he had.    Now it is true that sometimes we do just sort of bump our way into stuff, but most of the people I know who have achieved all or part of their dreams in this life not only had the courage to go on the journey to their dreams, they also had the courage to define them, and WORK for them.      Now I know that \\"The Alchemist\\"  is not a book against hard work but it does not even mention working for one's goals...that is sad and misleading to me.      It takes courage to dream, it takes courage to follow that dream and it takes even more courage to work, really work at that same dream even after the universe doesn't always seem to just conspire to make it happen.       \\"The Alchemist\\"  seems to leave that out of the equation for whatever reason.
B00005AUBA|5.0|First album I wanted to by was &quot;Happy songs for happy people&quot;, misfortune, they don't have it everytime I go to the music stores.  All their albums must be selling because, from week to week, they have different albums of Mogwai in stock.  It should not be long to get what I want.<br />I don't know why I like it so much, maybe because it is delicate, repetitive, mellow and cacophonic.  &quot;Sin wave&quot; is a nice frying thing which ends with a long distant etheral guitar.  &quot;take me somewhere nice&quot; is repetitive but georgous.  &quot;Dial:revenge&quot; is perfect and the nicest song on this album.  It will take me time to sing that Welch language!!  &quot;You don't know Jesus&quot; is second favorite starts very softly and gets more and more cacophonic to become soft again at the end. &quot;2 rights make 1 wrong&quot; is a nice happy song with delicate banjo at the end (really beautiful).<br />Quite a unique band.
B00005JM02|5.0|Got what I ordered and wanted in timely and complete fashion
B00009V7P8|5.0|this album is by far the best I've bought in a long time. Highlight of the album is the beautiful Older Chests closly followed by cannonball. but it is altogether an amazing album and Damien Rice is the best thing to come out of Ireland since u2! Fantastic!!!!

0385504209|5.0|The Da Vinci Code is the most outstanding book I have read in years. Dan Brown's writing style is simply unbelievable. It flows smoothly and he includes just enough detail to make his plot move along perfectly. He is a master of subplots, and the storyline is so thrilling and captivating that the reader is unable to put the book down. His character development is exceptional, and the reader actually feels that he/she is part of the plot rather than merely a witness to it. Clearly, the book is meticulously researched and it is obvious that Dan Brown is an extremely intelligent fellow. This book deserves a 5-star rating without a doubt. The people giving it low scores are probably devout Catholics embarrassed by the sad truths about their Church revealed in this book.
0385504209|3.0|Dear fellow readers:<br />This book, although entertaining, isn't made for people who enjoy a good read.  Some chapters are only ONE page long. The book and the plot lack detail, depth, thorough research, imagination, and it reads like something that the author purposely made simple to facilitate its conversion into a motion picture.  Kind of like a Sidney Sheldon or John Grisham best seller...P>Moreover, this book is just another story about a secret conspiracy by yet another secret society that is trying to rule over the world.  Why are these conspiracy theories so popular?  Because, due to the lack of external enemies (Soviets, Nazis, Japanese, etc.), someone feels the need to focus on internal ones (church, government, pharmaceuticals, agribusiness, wall street, etc.) and how they are secretly tring to dominate our lives and minds.  What I would like to know is, if all this is true, wouldn't those secret societies come crashing down upon us and make us...Best regards<br />AW

B00006879E|5.0|Never before have I been more blown away by a cd.  &quot;Songs About Jane&quot; grabs hold of you from the first beat of &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; and doesn't let go until the last note of &quot;Sweetest Goodbye&quot;.  From beginning to end, there simply isn't a bad song to be found.  Best described as a fusion of rock, blues, and funk, it's a sound that is irresistible, and a sound that is uniquely their own.  There are a number of future hits on this album, notably &quot;This Love&quot;, &quot;Must Get Out&quot;, and &quot;She Will Be Loved&quot;.  But it's not a stretch to say that any of the album's 12 songs could be a chart-topper.  It's THAT good.  Buy it now - before the stampede which is sure to come.  &quot;Songs About Jane&quot; will be your new favorite cd before the first half is over.
B0000U0X1G|1.0|This movie is now on my top 10 list of worst movies ever. I am embarrassed for any other reviewer who gave this movie more then 2 stars. I finished watching this movie and was thinking I would come here and get a least some entertainment out of it by reading other mocking reviews. Where are they!!!???!!!! This movie averages 4 1/2 stars here?! I must be out of touch?!<br />This movie trys to glamorize the S.W.A.T. team ala Top Gun. Collin Farrel is the the young hot shot looking for redemption/glory after he is kicked off the SWAT team initially. Samuel Jackson is the cliche &quot;Been there done that&quot; Sergeant who is putting together his own &quot;special SWAT squad&quot; and of course wants Farrel. Jackson also recruits a slew of other cliche characters. And speaking of cliches this movie just has one cheezey one-liner after another. I can't name another movie with more one-liners. If you don't vomit on the one-liners you will when you watch the team train and bond together.<br />Anyway there is this Eurotrash Frenchy arms dealing drug kingpin (which I find hard to believe seeings how his government would have the corner on this market, the arms dealing that is) who is arrested and offers anyone 100 million to break him out. Well that leads to my favorite part of the whole movie and probly the most absurd scene in movie history. There is a scene where a decoy convoy that is suppose to be transporting the Frenchy to a Federal Pen is ambushed by every gang in LA. The Bloods, the Vatos, the Vietnemese, they were all there to represent and break the Frenchy out for the 100 million dollars (Dr. Evil laugh)! It was the &quot;It's a Small World&quot; of gangs vs. the police in LA on that one block. How all the gangs came together and how they thought they would all collect the reward escapes me.<br />Anyway Jackon's &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot; SWAT team is called on to bring in the bad guy when he gets away.<br />To sum it up the movie was one big plot hole afteranother with a very healthy serving of one-liners. Get this show if you want to watch something with NO basis in reality.
B000084T18|5.0|Ok, so what other rap cd can u listen to with only liking like only 2 or 3 songs and the rest is garbage?  im sure you have heard alot of them.  on this cd though, every frickin song is good.  To all the as*****metal-zeppelin-weirdos- if u dont like the music, then dont rate it noone cares wat u think!  ANYONE WHO LISTENS TO RAP SHOULD COP THIS ALBUM RITE NOW.

B00008K78M|5.0|Laura's sweet and talented voice has carried her over many countries and languages. Even if you dont understand a bit of spanish, you'll trully know what her songs are about.

B00008EY9G|4.0|Ten strangers are trapped in a hotel on a dark and stormy night.  One by one they begin to die and each body is accompanied by a room key, counting down from 10 to 1.  The atmosphere is suitably spooky and the action is intense.  The ensemble cast, led by John Cusack and Ray Liotta, does a good job of portraying a random bunch of people, from an actress to a convicted murderer.  Gradually the pieces begin to fall into place and the viewer begins to understand the tangled web of this psychological drama.  It makes for an entertaining evening, but sometimes less is better, as in the case of the original book &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; by Agatha Christie.  Still, this movie is well-done and worth a look.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I'm actually pleased to see some people rate this CD 1 star.  Their comments inspired me to give Britney's new CD a listen, and after *1* listen, I have to say this CD rocks!  Those who actually have taste in music w/o being judgmental will take pleasure in enjoying this CD.  Can't wait for Jive to release Toxic around March 1 2004...should do well on radio and in dance clubs worldwide!
B00005JMGC|5.0|This thought-provoking movie is probably Julia Roberts' best one since \\"Erin Brokovich\\".  She is not just another pretty face, but she shows a lot of nuances in her performance.  She is surrounded by a talented cast of young women who at times oppose and at other times applaud her.  She portrays a young woman from California who has come to teach Art History at Wellesley.  She gets into trouble when she begins to teach more than her subject matter and she influences the girls to examine what they really want in life rather than to accept what they have been taught all of their lives.  What they have been taught is that the only acceptable path for a woman is marriage and maternity, despite where their talents, abilities or desires might lead them.  I went to college a few years after this movie (in the 60's) and the portrayal of expectations for women is not far off.  To give the movie-makers credit, this is not a one-sided portrayal.  Although one of the characters, Betty, is shown to have an unhappy marriage, another one of the girls chooses marriage over going to law school because that is what she truly wants to do.  This movie is bound to spark a lot of discussion about what the role of women really ought to be, but when it comes down to it, the movie shows that it's all about having choices.
B00009V7RF|5.0|this album is a nice touch of a little bit of everything...r&b, soul, rap, hip-hop. it's underground when it comes to terms with people you'd like throw in the circle of the roots, mos def, talib kweli, etc. this album has excellent blends of many flavors, there HAS to be a song you like at the very least. get off the hype and bangwagon wave of \\"where is the love\\" and listen to something else on this album. this album is excellent and it likes to tip toe on the line dividing hip-hop and rap a la respectable and commercial. if you buy this album, everyone in your house will like it because it's that good. i don't care if you hate rap, you'll like a song. papa roach even does a song with them, crazy stuff. they got catchy tunes and what not, but this album is focused on having fun, and it is. but it's not like orgy part fun, it's like chillax fun. nothing too depressing except for the apl-de song which makes you tear. but that's at the end of the cd where most of the swish-swash positive vibes have passed. excellent!
B000002JSZ|5.0|THIS IS AN AMAZING ALBUM!MOST SONGS ARE GREAT,THE BOYS ARE DOING GREAT .THIS IS MUCH DARKER THAN SOME OF THEIR PREVIOUS ALBUMS,ITS RAW AND TOUGH.THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE AC/DC ALBUMS FOR SO MANY REASONS:BRIANS VOCALS ARE GREAT LIKE ALWAYS,GREAT CHORUS',ANGUS,CLIFF,AND MALS GUITAR WORK IS AWESOME,AND PHILS DRUMMING IS TOP NOTCH,HE IS ALSO THE BEST DRUMMER EVER I MIGHT ADD!! I MIGHT ADD ALSO HE ONLY DID HALF OF THE ALBUM,THAT BRINGS IT DOWN A BIT.THERE IS NO SONG UNDER 3 MINUTES,I DONT LIKE IT WHEN A SONG IS ONLY ABOUT 2 MINUTES.I RECOMEND THIS TO ANYONE!!!!!!!
B00004T9UF|5.0|so what? he's white, forget that. picture every rapper as a gray blob. well, if eminem was a gray blob, you'd still recognize him. this album is more personal, less humor than the last, but it's a good change. he's mad, he's really mad, and he's homicidal. he lashes out at just about everyone and doesn't leave anyone out...including himself and his producer. marshall mathers landed on this album and doesn't feel like leaving. every song is a good anthem to something in your life. you WILL relate, black white blue green red yellow purple pink. you'll like this album and relate. i've seen metalheads love this album, and that says a lot for crazy metal heads. hip hop heads shadow away from this album for some reason, yeah it's commercial and isn't typical rap. but w/e, change is good i guess. he does bring something new to the game, but keeps some of the old elements in, like being mad and rapping from the heart, and actually sounding like he means. his voice will scare you on some songs. this is very good, not to be missed, if you do, he'll &quot;kill you.&quot;
B00008A7QK|5.0|when i first heard bang a gong on the radio i must have been seven years old. i remember trying to keep my feet still,it was impossible.i never thought must about the band after that. i figured they were just another johnny hates jazz or taco. in another words i beleived they created sonic geniusness once, and since it was so brilliant it could not be duplicated. i have never been so wrong in my life.T.REX in my opinion is the second best band after the beatles. marc bolan can make simple riffs and simple lyrics sound like an atomic glam-bomb exploding in your brain. if you like bowie, n.y.dolls, the ramones, or any artist that plays simple yet effective rock and roll buy this now. if you don't like it than you should listen to kennyG and good charlotte, because you have no musical taste.
B00006690G|4.0|...i'm a big big big crazy eminem fan, i got all his underground stuff. this album pissed me off because it lacked. he's not being slim shady anymore. he's rarely funny on this album and it's kind of...uhh. i'm not saying he's being half assed, but i have to an honest critic. it's missing something. it's too personal now, we don't care after a while. it's nice he throws his stories in there, but he's being more of an activists for whiney kids in this album than anything. this album sounds too formulated. but it's still good nevertheless. he still gives you his heart and you feel his love for his daughter on &quot;hailie song&quot;, his hate for his life in &quot;say goodbye&quot; and his anger at his personal life in &quot;soldier.&quot; every track on this album is punch to the face, no more slapstick slappings :( still, this album is excellent. you'll appriciate it, although it's a BIG BIG change from everything you know about eminem musically.
6301763041|5.0|At first when I started watching this movie, I thought it would be a smart comedy like &quot;Grease&quot;, but as I continued I realized that it was silly almost to the point of being stupid. I was dissapointed with the result, but I also realized that it was supposed to be that way, and now appreciate it as a silly movie. For instance, when I watched &quot;Scary Movie&quot; I knew what was coming. I had already known of its stupidity, and so I enjoyed it.I had different expectations for &quot;Cry-Baby&quot;, but now I love it just the way it is. It's full of fun that never impedes! The acting is great, especially Johnny Depp as Wade Cry-Baby Walker. Looking super hot as always as well! All the other actors/actresses were superb also. The storyline and writing were good for its purpose of being goofy. If you're looking for a smart comedy I'd suggest you view &quot;Meet the Parents&quot;, &quot;When Harry Met Sally&quot;, &quot;Freaky Friday&quot;, etc. But if a fun-filled, silly comedy is what you want, then &quot;Cry-Baby&quot; is for you!
B000000OQF|5.0|Everythings been sauid about this album, but check out this guys post:<br />Yo hip-hoppa's, how ya'll be?? You know, just like everyone, when I turn on the radio, I wanna hear nu rock, nu metal and hip hopp!! Yet all I keep hearing is dumb old bands that have NO prupose now and have never had any purpose at any point in their careers actually!! Why is the airwaves clogged up with this junk anyway?? &quot;Welcome To The Jungle&quot; has a horrible riff, dumb lyrics, and is the theme song for the Cincinnati Bengals, the wrost football team ever!! &quot;Sweet Child Ov Mine&quot; is a cheesy toon about remembering childhood, &quot;Mr. Brownstone&quot; is about a cooky neighbor, and &quot;Paradise City&quot; goes on for about 6 minutes too long!! Enough with all the annoiyng guitar solos, their sooo annoying!! Axl also has the most whiny voice ever. Plus the bass playa sounds like he's just tapping his bottom string and not playing, listen to the intro of &quot;It's So Easy&quot; and ya'll see whut I be meanin'!!! For good music, look to bands like Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Disturbed, KoRn, Bubba Sparxx, Eminem, Puff Daddy, Puddle Of Mudd, Seether, Saliva, Nickleback, Drowning Pool and the new talent like Clay Aiken and Smile Empty Soul :]!! Skip this WASTE of plastic!!! Peace out G'N R dudes.... <br />First, DO NOT take this f*g seriously. He doesn't like guitar solos, and he listens to Eminem. Paradise City is the second best song on the album, and in no way is it to long. remember, most of the 2nd half is the outro solo, which, by teh way, is AMAZING. Second, if anyone's familiar with music here, you'll know that Bass is to support the band. To add bottom. Limp bIzkit and Linkin Parks bassists are 10 times worst than Duff (bassist for GNR) Plus, the intro to It's So Easy is played on the guitar you dumbass. it sounds like the bass, but it's not. Third, Mr. Brownstone is about the bands drug addictions, not some cooky neighbor. <BR>This guy is obviosly a p*ssy a*s teenwho doesn't appreciate real music. I mean come on, look what he said: &quot; You know, just like everyone, when I turn on the radio, I wanna hear nu rock, nu metal and hip hopp.&quot; This guy doesn't appreciate rock n roll, so he has no buisness posting a review about music he hates. i think all Gnr fans should go post crappy reviews for nu bands liek Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit. I think i speak for all true rock fans, when i say that Appetite For Destrucion is a CD of true talent, and is, in my opinion, the greatest rock album out there. Long live GNR (the originals atleast!)
6305171769|5.0|Finally I get to agree with all those who have reviewed before me and with all those critics. HALLOWEEN H20 is a roller-coaster ride and had me on the edge of my seat, even during the opening credits. Jamie Lee Curtis, who suggested this project, turns in an excellent performance, as does the supporting cast. The music score adds to the incredible tension of this sequel which is actually better than HALLOWEEN II, but of course, not as good as the first. The script is written for maximum suspense, though it does seem that it relies a little too heavily on false alarms. Otherwise, this is an amazing movie. Well crafted, well scripted, well acted, well scored, well shot and well directed. It's an excellent movie. Though the first HALLOWEEN is of course the best of the series.
B00005JLXE|2.0|My brother warned me not to expect much from this movie, so I guess it was about what I expected. Duane Thomas gave an excellent review of the differences between the comic reality and the movie reality, and how stupid were some of the changes made in the movie. Suffice it to say that nearly every change they made led to a vastly inferior product. But there was another flaw that I think is important that I didn't see other people bring up, which is the notion of &quot;compression.&quot; In the original Miller series, the Elektra - Bullseye - Kingpin - Daredevil relationships were built up over about a YEAR of comic issues. There was a LOT of background information given about all the characters before the battle between Elektra and Bullseye, so that when Elektra got killed, it was a really big deal. In the movie, it was like &quot;easy come, easy go!&quot; Or &quot;Elektra, we barely knew ya.&quot; And the best part of the climactic comic issue was that it was told from the point of view of Bullseye, allowing the dark comedy to be played up to its fullest. In contrast, the movie was so rushed in character introduction that we had very little clue about why anyone was acting the way they did. In the comic, the Kingpin is actually a very interesting character. In the movie, he barely makes any sense. Not unlike the closing battle scene between him and Daredevil. It was all just a very amateurish attempt to take one of the great comic book story lines and stuff it into too small of a box. It's unfortunate, because if they had built up to this climax in say the 5th movie, they would have had a real franchise. This is the way the X-men movies are going with the Jean Gray / Phoenix saga. In a couple of years, the movie rendition of X-men #137 is going to knock people's socks off. The movie rendition of Daredevil #181 *should* have knocked people's socks off, but they diluted it with too many other plot lines and inane, made-up stuff like Matt Murdock giving his identity away in front of 30 people. Amateurish!
B00008NG5V|5.0|this CD I think has more upbeat but still mellow songs by jack.  after i had purchased the first CD i thought this guy has serious talent.  but the second CD blew me away almost every song is one of my favorites. &quot;the horizon has been defeated&quot; and &quot;talyor&quot; are two of the best tracks.  if you like laid back tunes, with a feel of reggae you will definatly LOVE this CD.  i cant wait until the next one
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I have been a hardcore Beatles fan for pretty much 16 of my 23 years.  But when this DVD and accompanying CD arrived, I didn't have much interest in it.  I really don't know why.  That all changed when my sister got the album for Christmas.  I listened to it and I loved it.  Especially the second disc.  The performances were so heartfelt.  The songs were done by his friends and people he knew and loved, unlike how a lot of tribute shows are done using new pop music faces who probably never heard the material before.  <br />I picked up the DVD and it is even better.  Seeing Dhani is like George is with us all over again and no matter how many times I watch it, I can't possibly keep from crying during Joe Brown's &quot;I'll See You In My Dreams.&quot;  I highly recommend this to any fans of George Harrison and the Beatles.  But beware, it's a tearjerker.  This concert is full of such love and celebration that I have to rate it as probably my favorite concert film. <br />We miss you George.<BR>Andrew
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This film is, quite simply, brilliant.  Unrelenting in its haunting, mystical and totally engrossing style, it is a &quot;how-to&quot; of entertaining, intellectual paranoia.  The basic elements of the plot involve a troubled, over-educated, misunderstood youth, who is taking pills for his undisclosed problems.  He happens to know that Armageddon is coming, as he was told by a 6 foot rabbit with the voice of Freddy Krueger.  As the days count down, Donnie rebels against the system and causes general chaos, all the while maintaining that the rabbit instructs him to commit these vandalistic acts, and that they will help to save the world.  On the night when Armageddon is supposed to occur, a series of events takes place and all the loose ends are tied up in a way that is both beautiful and utterly confusing.  It will require at least another two viewings for you to fully understand what happened, and even then you may not be sure.  An intellectual delight.
0743216458|5.0|So for those kids who would like to get this book but their parents say no for some reason well this review will tell you all the things about this book that you should know about. First I thought this was one of the best books I have ever read. Band of Brothers has a tough vocabulary so I recommend that people under 11 should choose another book. The content in this book is also a bit rough for youngsters and some gory and graphic parts are just not good for young people. Besides the negatitives there are some positives. Band of Brothers tells you all about what happened in the WW2. If I were the parent our person trying to decide whether or not to allow yourself or your son or daughter to get this book I would have to say yes but before they start to read have them explain why they want the book so bad. Is it because they just want to read about the blood and guts or is it because they want to learn more about what happened in WW2, Eroupe, France etc.. And the last thing I have to say is that Stephen E. Ambrose is a great author, his book was outstanding and tought me what WW2 was really like.<BR>I hope this review was helpful to you and your children (maybe). Was this review helpful to you?
B00005JMCN|4.0|Thelonious Monk was a genius at what some call the &quot;implied note&quot;.  He left notes out of the music, but the listener's ears and mind filled them in.  It is part of what made him a jazz titan.  &quot;Missing notes&quot; are used brilliantly and to great effect in this movie.  We don't have to see Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) and his wife becoming distant or fighting after their son dies to know why she leaves him.  The way the director sets it all up, we know their pain without even seeing the struggle.  Similarly, we don't have to see the years go by from the time 16 year-old Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) was left by his once wealthy family to do menial labor for a horse rancher to know how that turned him into an angry man.  Just knowing it happened is enough.  This is brilliant directing, for putting those kinds of intermediary scenes in the movie would have been clich&eacute;'d.  It would have been just using valuable screen time to tell us what we already know.  Instead, the pain is implied, and we each experience it in our own way.<br />That's just one of the brilliant aspects of this MUST-SEE FILM.<br />THIS IS NOT JUST ANOTHER `ROCKY' MOVIE.  IT IS A STORY OF HOW HURTING PEOPLE (AND A HURTING HORSE) CAN HELP EACH OTHER TO OVERCOME THEIR HURTS.  Charles, Red, and the trainer, Tom Smith (Chris Cooper), each help the down-and-out horse, Seabiscuit, to learn, once again, how to be a horse-to learn what was literally beat out of him by other cruel owners. Seabiscuit, as an animal, and as a failure as a race-horse, can't disappoint them the way that others in life have.  That's often the case with animals, which is why we love them so.  Seabiscuit repays the favor in spades, helping each one of them to overcome the hurts of their pasts and by helping a nation to forget the pain of the Great Depression.<br />PROS<br />* Narrator (David McCullough, from Ken Burns' documentaries) used effectively to provide the context for the challenging times of the Depression out of which Seabiscuit triumphed-may we never forget what a horrible time it was<br />* Good acting all around, particularly Tobey Maguire and Chris Cooper<br />* Gorgeous scenery and cinematography: How did they get those incredible race shots?<br />* This really happened! It is fascinating to know that the country was once riveted by the rivalry between Seabiscuit and the triple-crown winner War Admiral.  Great history!<br />CONS<br />Honestly, I can't think of any.  Some reviewers criticize that it takes 45 minutes before we meet Seabiscuit.  But that's crucial setup time for the characters.  That time was well-spent and certainly was used efficiently, as I noted above in my comparisons to Thelonious Monk.<br />PURCHASING RECOMMENDATION<br />Get it.  You'll watch it many times.  There are some fight scenes early in the movie that may not be suitable for young children.  But other than that, this is a wonderful family film.t of which Seabiscuit triumphed-may we never forget what a horrible time it was<br />* Good acting all around, particularly Tobey Maguire and Chris Cooper<br />* Gorgeous scenery and cinematography: How did they get those incredible race shots?<br />* This really happened!

B000002H2H|5.0|Dude this album kicks so much that you'll have to by new pants I loved it. I bought it 3 years ago and i'm still listening to every one of its songs. Fight Fire with Fire has such an awsome guitar at the beginning but later on in the song, the song is just telling u to skip to the next song, Ride the lightning. RTL is there best song ever it has a belting blow that u just have to listen to it again. Later my Prey (Big Baller).
B00006LLNU|5.0|I've read through a good number of the reviews, and have only one additional comment to make about (). This isn't intended to be listened to in the traditional sense...it's best &quot;absorbed.&quot;  Much in the same way would approach a Brian Eno Ambient piece or Harold Budd.  It becomes you and your environment.  Like a serene landscape...<br />Too bad their first album &quot;Von&quot; off Amazon...If you can find it, get it as well.
B000065U1N|4.0|A very good movie but leaves out what American soldiers were stranded.  The Army repeatedly asked for Bradley M2 tanks as back up when Clinton changed the mission from humanitarian to getting Aidid.  Clinton and his Defense Secretary Les Aspin said no to the repeated requests.  <br />The reason why is the Congressional Black Caucas (CBC) members said sending tanks to use against Africans would be racist.  The CBC members failed to realize that African-American, Hispanic and white American boys were in harms way and were killed.
B0000027RL|5.0|Fitting that this is likely the 500th review of this album, and my 100th review for Amazon.  Milestones such as these speak of convergence, timing, synchronicity, and in many ways this album represents all of that.<br />If Pearl Jam had released this album after two or three efforts, it might not have been the epic and incredible story it has now become.  That the debut album of a successful and innovative band is still their finest effort is a little sad, but only if you fail to consider the backstory.<br />Most of &quot;Ten&quot; was instrumentals waiting for a singer when Eddie Vedder played his bootleg copy.  In coming up with the lyrics for the music, the intersection of key talents was made, and the result was the &quot;Ten&quot; album that stayed in my CD player for nine straight months.<br />However, as is common with many debut albums, the material was worked over, perfected, and refined by the time the band recorded it in the studio.  Rarely do bands attempt to cultivate that germination period again: travel, touring pressures, and inculcation of the music business system tends to make that extremely hard to duplicate (the band Tool being the most notable of rare exceptions).  However, Pearl Jam's conscious decision to move away from the formula of &quot;Ten&quot; is all the more admirable when put into the context of their catalog: never again did they make another &quot;Ten&quot; but all the same, some terrific music.<br />Perhaps it's unfair to the band to compare any of their subsequent efforts with &quot;Ten&quot;.  It's a magical album, never missing a beat, almost supernatural in its cohesion and musicality, fitting in with the burgeoning grunge genre but also carving a prototypical niche of its own.  Vedder's lyrical abilities have never been eclipsed in other albums, and his singing is some of the finest of his career.  The band itself has evolved into something better over time, but on this debut album they are already tight and innovative, much more so than many of their contemporaries, equalled only by Nirvana and Melvins for creativity and (perhaps) equalled or surpassed only by Smashing Pumpkins and Soundgarden in music prowess.<br />Still, this is one of those rare works that has no weak songs.  Strong arguments can be made for Nirvana's &quot;Nevermind&quot; as the best album of the nineties; certainly it had a more discernable effect on music then, and resonating still today.  However, &quot;Ten&quot; is more listenable on a daily basis, with more depth and complex beauty to offer a listener... it's right up there with &quot;Are You Experienced?&quot; and &quot;Led Zeppelin&quot; as one of the greatest debut albums of all time.<br />fredmore so than many of their contemporaries, equalled only by Nirvana and Melvins for creativity and (perhaps) equalled or surpassed only by Smashing Pumpkins and Soundgarden in music prowess.<br />Still, this is one of those rare works that has no weak songs.

B0000DBJDL|5.0|Footage of classic period Pink Floyd is so rare and few, that Live in Pompeii is a real treat. It was filmed in 1971, at the peak of their musical genius and creativity (not to devalue the musical and conceptual brilliance of the masterworks Wish You Were Here, Animals and The Wall, but musically they reached their peak in the period between Meddle and Dark Side Of The Moon), and shows the classic line-up - Roger Waters (bass), David Gilmour (guitar), Richard Wright (keyboards) and Nick Mason (drums) - young, energetic, creative and unpretentious. At this point in time, pre-Dark Side Of The Moon, they weren't yet settled in a niche; they haven't yet made it into the consensus, and they kept experimenting and trying new things, messing about with synthesizers and recording techniques. In this DVD we see them both in the studio and in performance, as they keep exchanging instruments and experimenting, and that's what makes it much more interesting and alive than the Dark Side and The Wall concerts, let alone anything made after the split from Waters in 1983, in which point they were just bleating out their old hits again and again in the same way. Only just managing to break free from the influence of their originator, Syd Barrett, the Pink Floyd are still, in Live In Pompeii, in a transition and struggling to find their voice, yet at the same time not certain of the relevance of their music. Nick comments in one of the many interviews thrown in between the songs - `We might have become a relic of the past... to many we represent that childhood of '67, the underground scene...' - and at this point, there's little in their music that signals of their great break into the mainstream in 1973. In between the performances, we get to see little bits of the Floyd in the studio, in the first stages of creating their masterpiece, Dark Side Of The Moon. It's a fascinating historic relic and an engrossing look at history in the making.<br />The musical parts of the video concentrate on Pink Floyd's most experimental instrumental numbers - in fact, only two vocal numbers were included, excluding old stage favorites like Fat Old Sun, Remember A Day and Astronomy Domine and recent numbers like Fearless and San Tropez - which allows it to give us a real look at how they were experimenting with their sound at the time, and to see them live, undubbed, is priceless. Take the epic instrumental A Saucerful Of Secrets from 1968; as Mason keeps the savage and steady beat, Gilmour is sitting on the ground with his Fender in his lap, gently running a slide up and down it, barely touching the strings. Wright pounds chaotic and nearly random notes on his piano, while Mr. Waters, his bass laid aside, plays percussionist and strikes the cymbals fierce and hard. He then walks off to the gong, and starts beating the hell out of it. Wright moves over to his organ and Waters picks up his bass, and they pick up the rhythm. Not synths involved. On Roger's own Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun, he doesn't play bass at all; he just barely struggles with the lead vocals, and occasionally beats the gong.<br />The instrumental classics Careful With That Axe Eugene and One Of These Days we get to see the full ability of the Floyds' instrumental prowess, as they settle into hard and driving grooves with persistent drums and deep, powerful basslines. Careful With That Axe Eugene is shot by night, with images of bursting volcanoes juxtaposed with an ecstatic Roger Waters shrieking out the song's only vocals. The effects and editing may be dated, but the atmosphere is still mesmerizing. Synthesizers, whatever Floyd's criticizers may have been saying at the time, are used subtly and tastefully. In one of the interviews David and Roger discuss the suggestion that the synthesizers may have taken over their music, claiming rightfully that they're in total control of their music, and that electronic devices can ever only be means and equipment and never a replacement for the artist's creativity. Furthermore, they say, it's immensely important for a musician who wants to be in control of his music, to know all about the equipment, recording and editing. The film really does show Floyd to be a group of very conscious creators, who need to know and understand the final outcome of their efforts - it especially shows in the studio segments. This is and important trait that contributed a lot to Floyd's greatness.<br />A surprising and wonderful touch is the short number Mademoiselle Nobbs, a classic 12-bar blues. As Roger strums an acoustic guitar and David plays a soulful harmonica, Richard helps by holding the microphone for the lead vocalist - a lovely dog, who sings her bit in the finest blues tradition, in a soulful and heartfelt duet with Dave's harmonica. It sounds to me like the talented mutt is the same one who contributed her voice to the number Seamus from the 1971 Meddle album, and if you thought the dog's voice on that track was overdubbed, seeing Mademoiselle Nobbs live will change your mind. The concert is bracketed by the epic classic Echoes, which was split in half - a technique adapted on record only in 1975 on Wish You Were Here. Echoes remain, whether on record or live, one of Floyd's most wonderful and impressive numbers, and show their instrumental skill and creativity to the fullest. Strangely enough, this is the only song in the films that allows Dave and Rick to have their voices heard, while on their albums at the time they sang on most of the tracks.<br />Incredibly rewarding for Floyd fans, even those who are not as enthusiastic about the early material, is the extra footage added in 1973, which shows Floyd working on their upcoming masterpiece Dark Side Of The Moon. We get a chance to see David laying down the final layer of Brain Damage, dubbing the lead guitar part over the nearly complete song; we also get a glimpse of Waters messing about with the synthesizers while working on the classic electronic piece of musical paranoia On The Run, as well as Richard recording the vocals for Us And Them.<br />One final question - what's the matter with Rick's beard, and why is it fading in and out of existence throughout the movie? Because other than that, the illusion of a live concert is maintained most of the time, albeit one where the crowd is either centuries dead or carved in stone. The conception of the video, as well as the music, shows Floyd as what they were - one of the most original and creative (some might say pretentious, maybe) bands of their time, just one step before entering the pantheon of timeless music forever.
B00005JMFO|3.0|This film has a virtual \\"Who's Who\\" of British actors,all playing different characters that are experiencing the various forms of love and affection.<BR>Each story is self-contained, but there still remains a light thread that binds the different vignettes together(some characters overlap at work, friends of friends, etc).<BR>The plot is rather simple--5 weeks before Christmas, a sample of upwardly mobile Londoners all falling in/out of love.<BR>THe movie tends to drag in places, and the sheer volume of characters does get a bit overwhelming, but there are some brilliant acting moments that smooth over the film's lagging spots.<BR>Who steals the film is a toss-up between Bill Nighy and Emma Thompson. Nighy plays a washed-up Rock 'N Roller who's desperately trying to revive his career by making a schmaltzy Christmas record, and then going on a media-publicity storm to promote the hell out of the record. Nighy portrays the singer with enough broadness to make it funny, but still, there is a sense of real humanity in the acting--Nighy still manages to project a character, despite the cartoonish he's presented with. <BR>Emma Thompson plays a London housewife, whose marriage with Alan Rickman(amiably sleazy) is on the rocks. Her character is essentially written to breeze in, steal the scene and walk out. Thompson does so with brilliance. She takes the attention away from such luminaries as Rickman, Hugh Grant(portraying her PM-brother) and Liam Neeson(achingly beautiful in a woefully written story about a widower). Thompson's acting reaches a peak in a bedroom scene, in which she releases her grief over her failing marriage. The scene is beautiful in its simplicity, and Thompson knows how to keep the grief real, but not hysterical. The controlling reigned in sadness makes the scene all the more achingly poignant.<BR>Neeson's story is rather silly. His widower is trying to console his prepubescent stepson, who is in love with an American girl in his class. Neeson is game,and puts as much conviction and sincerity as he can, but his scenes reek of silliness and contrived humor.<BR>Colin Firth's story of a man jilted by his girlfriend, who runs away to France only to fall in love with his maid is pleasant in its straightforwardness. As is Kiera Knightly's scenes as a newly married bride dealing with her husband's resentful best friend.<BR>Laura Linney is good in the film, although she has very little to do, and her story, an American woman taking care of her mentally ill brother, rings a tad forced. Also tiresome is the passages with a young horndog (an annoying Kris Marshall) who goes to the US in search for sex.<BR>There's some amusing moments with Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister, although his story-line is often stolen by the lovely presence of Martine McCutcheon, who is gorgeous and sexy, as his beautiful secretary. <BR>Over all, this film does not ask any deep questions about love. It presents love in the most idealistic way. Thompson and Nighy both offer award-caliber performances, in this above-average mainstream film.
B00005JM02|4.0|Nemo is such a cute movie providing entertainment for adults and children alike.  The characters are witty and the animation is astonishing. The storyline of the overprotective parent, nd the young determined (&quot;handicapped&quot;) child is timeless.  Lessons are learned by all.  I did find the character of Dory to be rather obnoxious (or perhaps it was just the voice of Ellen DeGeneres), but this is a great family movie to add to your DVD collection.
B00008S2VG|5.0|When I saw the video for ¨ Hollywood ¨ I was rather disappointed:very photographic and everything but utterly unexciting( except for the Botox part)..<BR>When The VMAS were on , it moved me to see her strutting along with Christina and Britney: that was just too cute : a 45 year old prancing around with two 21 year olds in perfect harmony!!!! <BR>Since then ¨ Hollywood ¨ has been my favorite song this year( the Jacques Lu Cont's Thin White Duck Mix, to be specific:but more like the version you get on the ¨Remixed and revisited EP¨)..<BR>That said , I was pretty impressed with the ¨American Life ¨ video( the original ,I mean), and with the whole ¨American Life ¨ album..<BR>When I read those reviews denigrating this gorgeous piece of work : i just wonder  :How can anyone ignore the sweetness of tracks like ¨Love Profussion ¨ or ¨Easy Ride¨..???? That is beyond my mortal understanding..it is their loss i guess..<br />I adore Madonna for two reasons: she was the first major artist to put explicitly gay imagery on music videos (quite a punch to mainstream music industry back in 1990), and she was the mother of my all-time favorite song : ¨Ray Of Light¨..<BR>Until I die: i will always be expectant of her next song or album..I am very grateful to u Madonna, you are a Media angel..and a very nice addition to music history..AND you are at a point in which whatever you put out seems gracious..Like Mozart or Beethoven in their maturity( yep..sardonic jokes welcome here!!!): there is no possibility of musical wrong-doing for her now..<BR>Kiss U ..squeeze U Madonna!
B00005MP58|5.0|Shocking to me when first I realized it, the A&E production of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is number three on my personal list of favorite movies of all time. Every character is perfectly cast and played, from Mr. Darcy to Mr. Wickham and from Miss Elizabeth Bennet to Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Not to mention Mr. Collins, a supremely entertaining character at whom the viewer will laugh with pleasure. If you enjoy watching \\"Emma\\", you will find \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" more richly rewarding for its greater story line and character dimensions and its happy ending. My wife and I have watched \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" at least once a year since it first aired. Next to \\"The Godfather\\" and \\"The Godfather Part II\\", I think that \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the most entertaining movie ever made.<br /><br />Note: This review was written by my husband, but I heartily endorse, and concur with, his comments!

B0000A9GLS|4.0|Ten strangers stuck in a run-down motel, and one-by-one, they begin dying.  Identity takes you on a rollercoaster of humor and horror as you follow each character around a middle-of-nowhere desert location.  John Cusack and Ray Liotta give emotion-filled performances, as they lead the group of strangers through bizarre happenings.  As each person finds out more about the others, suspicions are raised and tempers flare.  It's a battle to survive the night.  The unrelenting desert thunderstorm around them adds a dreadful, soul-piercing facet to this movie.  Identity keeps you guessing all throughout the movie, and will leave you breathless at the shocking conclusion.
B000002MJC|3.0|This album is just not the best Depeche Mode.  I like the SOFAD album, but there are several songs that still kind of make me sick to this day.  There are standout songs, however, namely &quot;In Your Room&quot;, and I love rocking out to &quot;Rush&quot;, but as a whole, the Violator album that came before SOFAD, and the Ultra album that came a few years later are far superior pieces of work.  Thankfully Depeche Mode survived this dark period both musically and in their lives to make better music in the years to follow.
6305499365|4.0|Are you overworked? Underpaid? Not appreciated at the office?  Ever felt like telling the boss where he can stick his files?  Peter Gibbons (played by Ron Livingston), like many of us, can answer yes to every one of those.  Office Space takes you through the mundane work-life of several individuals who are fed up with corporate America.  Peter finds out just how fun slacking off can be.  While on a mid-morning break with colleagues, Peter finds a love interest (Jennifer Aniston), who end up watching kung fu with him, and trying to figure out where they belong in life.  This odd, comedic masterpiece keeps you laughing throughout, and doesn't disappoint.  Even Diedrich Bader (of Drew Carey fame) finds his way into this movie, as Peter's construction worker neighbor.  If you hate your job, and/or love Jennifer Aniston, this movie is for you.

B00005QCVT|4.0|Requiem for a Dream should be seen alone for the performance of Ellen Burstyn who shows that an actress of grandmother vintage can still can slam dunk the latest kid on the block for six and also manage to outperform everyone else even though she is part of a hip and fashionable MTV-type choppy and deranged independent film production.<br />Requiem for a Dream is not a nice movie. It is very dark, upsetting and mean but is also more than a tad bit exploitive of a number of elements that are done more than a bit over the top here. For this reason Aronofsky does cater for the shock market at times. Certainly if you think more about what you are seeing you will realize that the suspension of disbelief is remarkable but not even remotely close to the reality of life. For example - doctors do not rat out addicts to the cops, the neighborhood junkie knows exactly who is driving his car, you don't go around with a septic arm for days without knowing it, electric shock therapy is administered with an anesthetic and heroin dealers certainly don't turn up at the local supermarket in a truck to sell dope to hundreds of people queuing up on the streets. Aronofsky suspends our disbelief. He does is this brilliantly, but folks should reexamine the material a bit more closely before realizing that they have been duped into a wonderfully fantastic reality-based fantasy. Aronofsky even hints this fantasy world to you more than once and even in the closing segments. Requiem for a dream is a DREAM full of hope, desire, anxiety and failure played out to the tune of hyper-realism. It is wonderfully executed but this is fantasy mixed with a dash of reality that unfortunately too many people literally took to heart.<br />This film deserves its place as a cult classic and certainly the director is something of a talent to look out for. The premise revolves around a son addicted to heroin and his mother who is addicted to slimming pills so that she can fit into her nicest dress to play in a popular television game show as a contestant. All the horrors of the American Dream are played out to full effect and everything goes from bad to worse to terrible to extremely severe.<br />When all is said and done this is just fiction with a social comment to make but it is still hard to see what you can take away from it except maybe a sense that some people do end up in a bad way using drugs. However this should be no justification for the kind of brutality that the US government conducts in its own drug wars or the multi-millions of dollars that end up in terrorist hands from the black market drug economy (this is sort of explained during the jail sequence involving a sick guard). I took this movie as a very good social satire that is meant to shock in a \\"this is how bad things can get for some people\\" sort of way. It is a tad bit exploitative like I said, but heck some people go through this so why not film it. Just don't take everything you see here to heart and enjoy this art form for what it is - a great urban nightmare drama with some fine direction and acting to boot.popular television game show as a contestant.

B000088E6P|1.0|i don't understand how this cd could be so succesful? the man doesn't display talent. the effort seems pointless, who would waste their stinkin time to produce an album rapped by a man who just talks fast. i don't understand music these days. this is just another example a failure. justin timberlake will be in the same case too cuz his album is so corny and just not worth buying. don't purchase this cd! even if you are into this music, purchase O.D.B or P diddy.
B00005JM02|2.0|I am a big fan of Pixar Animation Studios' films(Monster's Inc., A Bug's Life and Toy Story), but this one does not reach the same comedic level as those that came before it.  <BR>The humor is really limited to a green sea turtle (who lasts in the movie for 5 minutes) and a few short conversations between Ellen Degeneris' character and different species of animals throughout the ocean.  <BR>I am not a big Ellen fan, but she was definitely the highpoint of this film's humor.  The main character was just kind of flat, and didn't really give Ellen the platform to be as funny as she could have been as the color commentator sidekick.<BR>Don't get left high and dry, rent before purchasing.  You won't miss it.<br />The DVD has some really cool features, including (but not limited to) both widescreen and fullscreen renditions of the movie.<BR>A tour through the Pixar Animation studios (led by Nemo's real life counterpart).<BR>And you can turn your tv into a fishtank.
B00004ZAV3|2.0|I am a huge beatles fan, but I do not like this album at all. If you really want to get into the beatles than buy Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band or The White Album. This cd only has a few of my favorite 20 Beatles songs. I understand that it is their number one hits compilation, but my advice is to look elsewhere if you want to buy a Beatles album, because this one does not do them justice.
0380789019|5.0|This is a book that one each page, plausibly puts forth another unbelievable experience. Gaiman skillfully created a fantastic world full of impossible possibilities.  From people keeping their life hidden to people falling through the cracks.  The banter between the arch villains Croup and Vandemar is so light and breezy you forget they are pure evil. The Marquis is a slick, likeable, fast talking charlatan. He is equal parts mischief and good and evil. You never know what to expect. Door and Richard are the main characters, and they are built flawlessly with Gaiman's narrative.  This is a very enjoyable novel.  I got this book because I enjoyed American Gods, I can safely say that this is Gaiman best effort at a Novel to date. <BR>T

B00005JMEW|5.0|\\"Kill Bill\\" is POSSIBLY the most violent movie ever made.  My wife HATES violent movies (not a moral-judgement-issue, she just doesn't have the stomach for it) ... After FINALLY acquiescing to go see it with me (i'd seen it once already), she loved it SO much she wants to hit the bargain cinema one more time before it leaves theaters for good!<br />This film is THAT great.  Every scene is CHOCK full of rich, wonderful visual and sonic stimuli.  I'm not a big Kung Fu movie buff, so I'm sure I didn't catch all the references, but a knowledge of the genre is not required to be blown away by every aspect of what Tarantino has accomplished here.  It was even better the second time, and I look forward to further viewings; it's definitely one of the few films that are worth such an investment of time (along with \\"Pulp Fiction\\") ...<br />The critics who dissed this movie just don't get it.  They don't LOVE movies the same way Tarantino does; I mean I'm sure they love movies, but from a more academic viewpoint that probably has difficulty encompassing the action genre at all, even when executed so skillfully.  This movie is just 100% FUN, and upon reflection is the perfect NEXT movie in Tarantino's catalog.  I'd love to see him follow a career trajectory where each movie takes on a completely different genre, but puts the unique QT-stamp upon it.  So far, he's 4 for 4 in my book.<br />Just the idea alone is genius: the most over-the-top kung-fu film EVER, but nearly ALL the warriors are female.  You gotta love that, and after seeing it you gotta love it even more!  Along with \\"School of Rock\\", one of the FEW reasons movies DIDN'T suck in 2003 ... Thank you Quentin Tarantino; I hate to gush but you really are a genius.
B00005OM4N|4.0|I didn't really care much about Britney's music, just her looks.  Never listened to her on a serious basis, either.  I'm in college and all I listen to is electronica and drum'n'bass.  But it's clear Britney is following the footsteps of Madonna (that's obvious), and I actually found myself enjoying listening to &quot;I'm a Slave 4 U&quot;, because it was like an electronica-sex-goddess.  In fact, after listening to it, it's pretty sexy, and the music is cool, but I'm afraid my little sister shouldn't be listening to it.  It's a bit too sexy for a middle-school girl, but sexy enough for a college guy who hates mainstream crap to appreciate Britney Spears.  Wierd.
B00006AFUR|4.0|Capricorn (A Brand New) - Really good, first single off of CD.  Guitar riff is very good, and give you first showing of Space that is everywhere in this CD.  There is a tone I can't describe, but this song is good.<br />Edge of the Earth - If you like Capricorn you'll like this song, it takes the space motif to a higher level, but is equivelant to Capricorn as in the some of the riffs.  The chorus is what makes this song distinctly better in some ways.  At the end they take the refrain even better when the rest of the bands sing in while the guitars go.  This is the seond single released by 30 Seconds to Mars.<br />Fallen - This song to a while for me to get used to.  The initial raiting wouldn't have been good, but after I listened it's a really good track.  The drum is what caught my attention, the intro has the drummer just beating kinda cool like and it gets your attention.  This is where it got bad - The drums went away, and Jared starts talking about visiting Jupiter and that's the point when I changed it.  Now I heard the refrain (the best part) and the guitar just goes off and Leto starts screamin and I wish it were live.  The drums finally come back in the end at the breakdown. (The breakdown is when they change a certain part of the song to make it harder and it comes out better, it's almost on every track)<br />Oblivion - Best track on CD.  Talk about destruction and war on a planet.  Don't let the lyrics get you off this song is the best.  The guitar is what gets you, and it is the best I have heard in a while.  The voice on Leto is beautiful as well.<br />Buddha for Mary - Awful song, he uses a synthesizer on his voice and it's awful to me. No more comment.<br />Echelon - The second best track.  This song and Oblivion are one of the few that may actually get you lost in the lead singer's ashonatical world.  One can feel the space feel, and I was playing Metroid Prime, as well, but this song is good.  Chorus and verses are all good.  Coincedentally the breakdown is simple, but the instrumental in this song is beautiful.<br />Welcome to the Universe - Vocals are very attractive.  Guitar riffs as usual are good and different from many other songs on the album other than 93 million miles.  Chorus has Leto screaming out &quot;Welcome to the Universe&quot;.  Space motif in full force.  Bass-line is loud and helps the song out.<br />Mission - A little corny, but real good song, I usually just listen to the first verse and chorus.  In the midle of the chorus there's a loud &quot;Hey!&quot;.  This song sems like a filler and is kinda corny but once it grows it sounds good.<br />End of the Beginning - By now you're used to the sounds of every instruments and this is no exceptio.  Chorus is very short, lyrics get stranger to realize what he is talking about, but it is a good song listen to it just for the breakdown.<br />93 Million Miles - Third best song, I heard this in a Sam Goody and couldn't wait to get home and find out who it was I was listening to.  Starts off slow with the drums lightly tapping the bras, then the guitar comes in before Leto goes.  Guitar line is extremely good as simple as it is.  The chorus is just awesome, and the breakdown is incredible, but just because you get to hear that guitar line loud and clear.<br />Zero Year - A good song.  Guitar sound is different than the whole album for just listening to the whole thing.<br />Jared, I like most of hi movies that I've seen (Panic Room), but bring another CD.  And if you're CD is this good make a movie as futuristic as this, I want to be a writer, and this helps inspire.

0385504209|2.0|If I were to write a thriller featuring a high-speed car chase and wrote with what very little I know about cars and how they handle, I'd ruin the story. I doubt that I would find a publisher. In addition to several `venial sins,' there are many serious lapses, mortal sins that make one wonder why the publisher went ahead with this project.<br />The pain of childbirth did not give birth to the \\"idea\\" of original sin. Genesis, which came into written form in the 11th or 10th century before Christ, used that pain as one of a half-dozen symbol sets  (joy and pain in childbirth) of the ambiguity-good and evil-brought into God's good world by the sin of Adam and Eve.<br />The Hebrew canon or official list of books that constitute the Bible was determined by a rabbinical council near the end of the 1st century, and the list of what constituted the \\"New\\" Testament was evidently fairly well accepted by early Christian communities by the middle of the 2nd century.<br /><br />Constantine make Sunday the day of worship. From the earliest days, Jewish-Christians observed the Sabbath, which ended on Saturday evening, and then, the same evening when the first day of the week begins, they concluded the Sabbath feast with a Eucharist to commemorate the resurrection of the Jesus.  They gave significance to the day as the first day of the new creation (a reference to Genesis and the creation of the world).<br />If pictures of the Egyptian Isis nursing Horus became the blueprint for our modern images of the Virgin Mary nursing the baby Jesus, then the blueprint was hidden for a millennium. In earlier depictions, Mary is regal, seated by the side of Jesus. The first depictions of Mary nursing Jesus are medieval.<br />Altars are found in the Bible, not just in pagan religions. Communion with the divinity is indeed found in pagan religions, but the Eucharistic consumption of Jesus' body and blood comes from Jesus' own transformation of the ritual of the Jewish Seder (or, possibly, a chaburah meal), not from paganism.<br />The divinity of Jesus was not voted on at Nicea in 325. Belief in the divinity was firmly in place in the earliest Christian communities. Consider only John's Gospel, which was in existence at the beginning of the 2nd century. What was debated strenuously and eventually passed at Nicea was the introduction into a statement of belief of what heretofore had been a philosophical term: homoousios or, `of the same substance.'<br />The Gnostic gospels were suppressed not on the basis of their depiction of Jesus as human, but because they are fanciful accounts of miracles and distant travels. The four `winning' gospels are really expanded passion/resurrection proclamations with few of the details that are indispensable to biography: childhood accounts, what Jesus did for the first 30 years of his life, etc. More than likely, the gospels of Philip and Mary and Peter and all the rest didn't make the cut because they went way beyond proclaiming the good news of the saving death and resurrection.<br />The Dead Sea scrolls contain Hebrew and inter-testamental writings, not gospels. They have interest to Christians only as witnesses to the events that formed a background for the ministry of Jesus and travails of the early church.<br />Mary Magdalene, the prostitute. It is true that Gregory the Great confused the identities of Mary of Magdala and the woman who was a sinner. Whether that culminated a smear campaign in the early church is far from certain. Some `Fathers of the Church\\" called Mary `the apostle of the apostles.\\"<br />Social decorum at the time of Jesus did favor marriage, but there were brotherhood societies (chaburah) and religious communities. Scholars today are not sure if the Last Supper was a brotherhood meal or a Seder. In either case, it would not have been surprising for a celibate teacher to gather the family of his disciples for either of those activities.<br />The tribe of Benjamin is not a royal tribe. Neither is the tribe of Juda, the other of the 12 tribes that survived the Assyrian conquest when the 10 `lost' tribes disappeared.

It refers to a hypothesis favored by biblical scholars of all major persuasions: a common source of the sayings of Jesus might pre-date and underlie the sayings that are found, in near word for word identity, in Matthew, Mark and Luke. This source may have been incorporated into the synoptic gospels, each of which has its unique character. No one believes that such a source would have been written by Jesus in his own hand.<br />Shekinah is a word meaning `the presence or shining forth of God' and was a circumlocution for the inhabitant of the Holy of Holies, whose name, YHWH, could never be pronounced.

B000089RVX|4.0|So for weeks I have been hearing this song on the radio.  I loved it, but for the life of me could not figure it out.  Then, I saw an ad on TV telling me to get the new Evanescence album and sure enough it was that song.  That next morning I ran right out and bought the CD and let me tell you I havn't repented yet.<br />First of all, you should know that I prefer heavy metal, the heavier the better, but I do have a taste for good music no matter what it is.  I also love a woman who can really sing and Evanescence really blows my mind.  I rather enjoy most of the songs on their debut CD, though, a couple of songs I pretty much do not prefer at all.  The music is fast paced and for the most part and has a nice mixture of some solid guitar mixed in with smooth classical sounds.  The part that really gets you is the woman's voice.  It is a unique voice that really drives the music home and is one of the major reasons why I was attracted to this CD.<br />There style can cross several musical flavors and you can see a lot of potential with this band.  I would be worried that they lose their edge in upcomming albums and get a little pop oriented in order to keep up their success.   You can sense this possibility within the band it is not unsual for the sophmore jinx to hit.  However, if they stick with what they did on Fallen and continue to create bone chilling tunes, this band will become big time in a real hurry.<br />A definate buy!

But as always it just gets better and better - you can't listen to DT once, it takes more than that to appreciate their talents.  It hasn't come out of the CD player very often and the keyboards start to come through (once you realize those guitar solos are actually the keyboards).<br />For myself I listen to DT for outstanding musicianship, great riffs and passages, music that takes chances: and this is what I get from DT.  Like the progressive predecessors from the old days - Yes, Zappa, et al, DT takes chances.  Some times it works and sometimes not, but more often than not, we are blessed with genius.  <br />This album was what I expected from DT and I have yet to be disappointed with any albums.  Although SFAM is clearly their best work, this one is another strong effort.  The musicianship, orchestration, great progressions all come together to make listening to music exciting.   Like Steve Vai, DT take chances and I could listen to both all day and night.<br />Happy Listening - the more you do it the better it gets!
B00009TB5G|4.0|Fascinating stuff for a wanna be &quot;behind the scenes of a sci-fi movie set&quot; guy like me.<BR>Incredible detail and mezmorizing peeks into the production of this installment of Tolkien's master piece. [...]
0375422307|5.0|The story of a young a girl during the Iranian revolution and into wartime with Iraq is at times touching and funny, and at others absolutely horrifying. Satrapi truly captures the nature of these difficult times without pandering to emotion or losing the innocence of a child's point of view. The story is split into 'chapters' which can sometimes make the story seem a little disjointed, but never enough to really distract. The artistic style is simple but effective, and really captures some of the more surreal moments, such as her conversations with God. Definitely a must read.

0312305060|5.0|I saw the movie when it came out, and loved it. I had read Michael Cunningham's two other books, and thought they were both wonderful, but it took me a while to get around to reading the Hours. I'm so glad I did.<BR>&quot;The Hours&quot; is a on the surface a story about the three women from diffrent time periods, each story over the course of one day. There's Virginia Woolf, writing Mrs. Dalloway, Laura Brown, a suicidal '50s housewife, and a modern day Mrs. Dalloway, buying flowers for a party in honor of a dying friend. The storys all come together by the end of the book, but even from the begining, they are connected through subtle usages of themes and imagery. It says things about life and death that will ring true to everyone. This book is a wonder.<BR>Also, I would like to add that I've never read anything by Virginia Woolf  (although this book makes me want to), and I still loved it.
B000084T18|4.0|Damn! Why would any 1 give this album 3.7 stars out of possible 5. This is a great album and 50 Cent here is one of the best rappers present. <BR>Now a little about the album:<BR>Favourite tracks:<br />&quot;Patiently waiting&quot; : Never been Eminem's fan but this song got real cool beat and lyrics. Em was good.<BR>&quot;In da club&quot; : First single and super hit. In every car this song is poppin' out. Love this one.<BR>&quot;If I can't&quot; : Cool song.<BR>&quot;P.I.M.P&quot; same comment as In da club. But dont like the snoop's one.<BR>&quot;21 Questions&quot; : I think he only asks 19 Questions but i may be wrong. Anyways, the song is the best in the album.<BR>&quot;Wanksta&quot; The best gangsta rap song ever created.<br />Overall the album is not bad at all. Go cop this one.
B00008ADPF|2.0|I bought the limited edition version of this on the day it came out. At a place I normally wouldn't buy it at because of the insanely high price $17.99!!!! I was on vacation and it was the only music store was my excuse... I still call myself an idiot for that.  But then, I was expecting a good cd. What I got was dissapointment.To top it all off I didn't even have a good vacation. <BR>As soon as I popped this cd into my portable cd player I knew something was wrong. I took out the lyric sheet and then knew something was really reallllyyyy wrong. What happened to Nickelback?! Their first three cds don't sound anything like this one, lyrically anyway. I worried that it was just me (maybe a chick thing?) and then my brother borrowed my cd player and this cd -he didn't like it either. On all their other cds I liked practically every song; on this cd there are only three I can tolerate. <BR>They are...<BR>If you're even interested...<BR>Track 2. Do This Anymore<BR>Track 3. Someday (yeah generic but not offensive)<BR>and...<BR>Track 6. Because of You<BR>All the others just seem to insult my intelligence with their blandess.
B00005A46T|4.0|Pretty good compared to the last album (SLIPKNOT) . I was kind of surprised to see their come back. I have their two albums : SLIPKNOT and IOWA and both are not old for me. <br />Yeah guitars are kind of used repeaditly but not alot. After listening to it the first time i thought the album sucked. But now after year or two its not bad. They don not sound like any other band present. Better than most.<br />Favourite songs:<br />People = Sh*t<BR>Disasterpiece<BR>Everything Ends<BR>I am Hated<BR>Iowa<br />The last track IOWA is very long (about 14 mins.) but starting it with slow guitars and very slow vocals. After a while it becomes a very angry song.<br />Overall one of the best Metal album present.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is an emotional look at the World War 2 experiences of the men from E Company, 2nd Battalion 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. Over 10 episodes, the men grow from young recruits training in Toccoa, Georgia to soldiers on the frontline of some of the Allies' most crucial battles. <BR>The stories which unfold do not set out to make every man a hero who saved the world singlehandedly, but rather as human beings who came together as a group and battled against the odds. Each episode is seen through the eyes of a different soldier, everyone from Easy Company's unquestionable leader 'Dick' Winters to a field medic to a paratrooper separated from his battalion. The stories are touching and emotional but not to 'Hollywood' that they lose authenticity. <BR>The men upon which the show is based, the real veterans of E Company, provide interviews in the opening of each part of the series, giving insight into how the group really felt. Band of Brothers is not a show written by another big-shot whose closest encounter with war is through the nightly news. <BR>One cannot recommend this series enough. To watch it is to pay homage to those young men who created the freedom we have today, to respect and be grateful for what they did.<BR>For those who appreciate that war is not all guts and glory, or who respect what the men of the WW2 generation did, Band of Brothers is a brilliantly written and produced series worthy of 5-star status.<br />The DVD boxset is brilliant, with documentaries and interviews to complement a perfect audio-visual transfer. It is complete with both Dolby Digital and DTS soundtracks, is presented in 16x9 widescreen format, and includes subtitles in nearly every language imaginable. As any DVD buff will tell you, Band of Brothers sets the standard for TV on DVD.
0553278223|5.0|I was originally inspired to read Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles mainly because of the critical acclaim and praise my father said it has received; it isn't very often a science fiction novel is accepted and enjoyed so widely. The most unsettling thing about this novel (or, this collection of short stories) is the fact that there are not any characters or events which Bradbury centers upon. The first chapter, &quot;Ylla,&quot; grabs the readers attention very well, though I found myself a bit disappointed when the characters of that chapter did not return. As a whole, however, the overall message and talent bound within the pages of The Martian Chronicles is too important to miss due to something as insignificant as characters. The vast majority of novels out there contain central characters, and many of those very same novels are character-driven. That said, The Martian Chronicles is completely plot-driven. This makes the book not only extremely refreshing, but one need not go through the utter pain of seeing one's favorite character die, because it is very unlikely you would have a favorite character! <BR>My personal favorite features of The Martian Chronicles were the chapters &quot;Usher II,&quot; &quot;There Will Come Soft Rains,&quot; and &quot;The Green Morning.&quot; As is with most Bradbury works, according to my father, the author tips his hat to his favorite authors with excerpts from poems, songs, and even the fabulous parallel to Edgar Allen Poe's The Cask of Amontillado in &quot;Usher II.&quot; Bradbury's use of language and description of fantastic settings and creatures was impressive, to say the least. The descriptions of the Martian race were so intricate and unique each time that one could certainly picture the fictitious peoples, as well as their &quot;chemical baths&quot; and &quot;sand ships,&quot; the levitating pirate ships with sails of blue mist. The wonderful aspect of science fiction is the new and refreshing imagery introduced, and Bradbury used this to his advantage. <BR>In a nutshell, The Martian Chronicles is not only thought-provoking, but a real fun book to read. The reading level is good for any high school student, and is neither slow nor complicated in the beginning or abrupt at the end.
B00006AFUR|4.0|When I started getting into this band, I had no idea it was Jared Leto's project. In fact, I really didn't care who Jared Leto was as an actor. Had I known about the hubbub, I would have avoided this at all costs, and missed out on a truly good band. The only star deduction (from 5 to 4) was taken for the space theme. It gets annoying at times.<br />As far as the tracks, I couldn't disagree with Chris from Louisiana more. Obviously this is a matter of opinion, but just in case there are people like me out there, I figured I'd toss in my 2 cents.<br />&quot;Capricorn&quot; is OK. It seems great when you hear it on the radio with the other tripe, but when you hear what else the band is capable of, it appears mediocre in comparison. I much prefer &quot;Edge of the Earth&quot;.<br />&quot;Fallen&quot; is one of my favorites, and the chorus guitar and vocals bring to mind the &quot;Thanks to Maynard James Keenan&quot; in the liner notes. It is definitely the most Tool-esque (Aemina days) track. This, and &quot;Buddha for Mary&quot;, are what break up the occasional monotony on the album and take it to the next level.<br />&quot;Buddha for Mary&quot; is the most striking track. The imagery is very disturbing, and the vocal processing fits. Also very heavy Tool-esque guitar pre-chorus. When people complain about over synthed voices, it brings to mind Cher and Madonna's techno experiments. That is not the case here. It is not processing for the sake of being technical or artistic, it adds to the song. I think the specific part he had a problem with is the first few lines. After that the song is very different, and he may not have made it past that.<br />&quot;Oblivion&quot; and &quot;Echelon&quot; are the most commercially accessible tracks on the album. &quot;Echelon&quot; was on &quot;The Core&quot; movie soundtrack. &quot;Oblivion&quot; sounds like it belongs in the latest generic space summer blockbuster during the epic &quot;battle/crisis/blow stuff up&quot; scene. Nota bad song, but feels very contrived.<br />&quot;Welcome to the Universe&quot; struck me as being the most Deftones like (the intro specifically, not the chorus or bridge), but I could start to hear the Smashing Pumpkins after reading MD from LA,CA's review.<br />I don't know that I would call &quot;Mission&quot; corny, but I could certainly see how it could be viewed as such. It's got this Devo meets Oingo Boingo playing a new version of &quot;Mr. Roboto&quot; thing going on. Ok, nevermind, it's corny.<br />&quot;End of the Beginning&quot;- blah.<BR>&quot;93 million miles&quot;- great track! However, the initial vocals are very similar to &quot;Buddha for Mary&quot;'s &quot;This is life on Mars&quot; part.<br />&quot;Year Zero&quot; is an OK song. The &quot;We'll never fade away&quot; part annoys me for some unknown reason, particularly the end crescendo. Excessively anthem like? Too repetitive? Not sure. However, the vocal quality on the end repetition begins in a very Deftones fashion. If only it wasn't said so many times you want them to just bloody well fade away already.
B00000DCHD|5.0|Obviously this is billy joels best work. I bought an eight track player for 3 bucks and two copies of 52nd streen on 8 track.  I wont listen to this remastered crap. This is definitely the most creative joel gets. The stranger is a wonderful album, very good. But in my opinion this is a step up from stranger, and glass houses is a step down from 52nd and stranger put together. 1979 was the last year so many good artists could squeeze out their last bit of awesome 70s creativity. By 80 everything seemed to be pretty much run out, or dried up! Best songs-<BR>-Zanzibar (absolutely billy joels best song ever)<BR>-52nd street (this is a very hot little jam compared to what every one else says, and the whole late 70s jazz thing is such a high for me)<BR>-rosalindas eyes (Rhodes piano is tremendous)
B00008PW2D|3.0|I absolutely love this show but somehow, I just don't feel right paying so much for eight episodes. The episodes were good but not that good. If you're yearning for it then I guess it's okay but come on, so much $$ for so little? I'll wait until it goes for a cheaper price or until someone else buys it for me.
B00006CXXU|5.0|It's been little over a year since Stripped has been released, and the c.d. is still in my c.d. player.  If you want to listen to REAL music, this is the C.d. to get.  Christina has so much emotion and it is obvious through her songs.  I love this c.d. and i can't wait to see what she is doing next.
0743455967|5.0|Stephen King has made a remarkable and substantial change with this book, and through the book he has proved that his writing abilities are not limited to his stereotypical horror/fiction genre.  On Writing explores King's childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood as a writer.  Not only does the book give background information, it provides tips on submitting manuscripts to magazines and the importance of finding an agent.  <br />The book also discusses how King's accident in 1999 affected his health and writing. <BR>King provides the reader with examples of prose and examples of how he edits prose to keep it concise yet informing.  The book is a quick read and well worth your time if you aspire to become a [better] writer.   King's genius is undisputable, but this book is testimony that his genius is not limited.
B00008K9Z5|4.0|Meteora is a great CD but Hyrbrid Theory was WAY better. I think this new one may how too many sound effects. Don't get me wrong,its sounds good but..blah. THeir first CD is more raw and strong. I'd still reccomend it though!
B0000TB050|5.0|Just when I thought I couldn't appreciate u2 any more than I already do, they release an absolutely incredible DVD with the Slane Castle performance.  It is hands down the most brilliant concert I've ever seen as the greatest rock band ripped the stage in front of their hometown crowd in Dublin.  The Irish government should declare Sept. 1, 2001 a national holiday in dedication to this concert.  This concert was perfection, created by amazing tunes, high emotions, and a crowd of 80,000 fans that didn't stop the whole show.  Legendary producer Rick Rubin summed it up perfectly when stating that &quot;seeing u2 live is like a religious experience.&quot;<br />It is hard to write in this review why this DVD is so incredible, but here are some of the reasons: (1)The way u2 walk onto stage and the crowd absolutely erupts as the band rips into &quot;Elevation&quot; (2)The complete performance of &quot;Until the End of the World,&quot; my favorite live u2 song, laced with the wicked riffs of the band's genius guitarist, the Edge. (3)When Bono sings &quot;New Years Day&quot; with the Irish flag wrapped around him (4)The surprising appearance of &quot;Out of Control&quot; in the set and Bono's speech during the middle of the song which brings the crowd to probably it's highest peak of rowdiness. (5)The emotional performance of &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; which concludes with u2's frontman singing &quot;Wake Up Dead Man&quot; while thousands of lighters appear in total darkness. (6)&quot;Kite,&quot; one of my favorite u2 tracks ever, which Bono dedicates to his father who had just recently passed away.(7)&quot;Angel of Harlem,&quot; which shows how much fun the band members still have together playing live after 20 years. (8)Probably my favorite on the DVD, the absolutely amazing &quot;All I Want is You,&quot; which the lead singer dedicates to his beautiful wife Ali.  I also like the part when a fan drenches Bono in water and he turns around and says &quot;All I want isf***ing you, man!&quot; (9) &quot;Streets Have No Name&quot; = The crowd.  Get the DVD, you'll realize what I mean. (10)The emotional conclusion of the concert with classics like &quot;One&quot; and &quot;With or Without You.&quot;<br />This DVD makes you feel like you're at the concert, it will make you forget you have a couch in your living room as I stood up the whole time I watched it.  I liked the camera work even though some didn't, it made me feel like I was there.  The Bonus features are terrific as well, with the Unforgettable Fire documentary and a spincam in which you can rotate the camera angles.  Pretty cool stuff.<br />u2 are one of the greatest bands of all time hands down, they've always made amazing music but they just have that &quot;something else&quot; which put them on top of everyone else.  Whether it be the original sound of Edge's guitar, having the most charasmatic lead singer, the friendship between the four members, I don't know.  Bono refers to this as &quot;IT&quot;, that u2 &quot;just have IT.&quot;  Well, &quot;IT&quot; was present and stronger than ever on Sept. 1, 2001.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|This is without a doubt the most powerful album ever made. The title track is one of the greatest songs ever written. The lyrics follow the melodies perfectly, and Art's voice is the only person that could truly make it work. I can't say I'm a big fan of El Condor Pasa, but it is not a bad song. Cecilia is the same way with me. I enjoy the catchy Keep the Customer Satisfied, even though it feels rushed. So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright is a beautiful tribute to an old friend (and the friendship between Paul and Art). The Boxer is definitely my favorite song, and is the true masterpiece of their career. Baby Driver is an OK song that has a different, addicting feel to it. The Only Living Boy in New York is a great song along with Why Don't You Write Me. Bye Bye Love feels unnecessary, but is nice to hear a live song, and alternate style on the everly brothers. Song for the Asking is an underrated masterpiece. Fueilles-O does not settle with me, and I might possibly love the Demo of Bridge Over Troubled Water more than the original. While it doesn't have the consistancy of Parsley, Sage, Rosemary, and Thyme, it is still a timeless work of art.
B00005ABKC|5.0|Petty's writing on classic songs like &quot;Insider&quot; and &quot;The Waiting&quot; is surely on a par with Dylan, and may even surpass that. This is such an emotional, hellbent, crazy-sad rock and roll record, filled with little twisted masterpieces. Petty topped his previous albums with &quot;Hard Promises&quot; and never quite equalled it afterward. That's OK. Any artist who hits a peak like this can be forgiven for &quot;Into The Great Wide Open&quot;...
0385504209|5.0|I loved this book! I heard the uproar surrounding it, and decided to check it out for myself. It was so much better than I expected. Before I read this one, though, I read Angels &amp; Demons. It set the stage. Amazing. I didn't think it could any better. I was wrong. The Da Vinci Code blew me away!!<br />If you've read the book, you have to check out Dan Brown's website. [...]<br />There are some fascinating facts, pictures, and an incredible game. Game seems too light a word. More of a treasure hunt along the lines of the adventure Robert and Sophie took. It led me all over the internet, and I certainly learned a few things.
B00006RCNW|5.0|Cable programming will never be the same again, and &quot;The Shield: Season 1&quot; is the reason for that.  A cop drama unlike any you have ever seen before, this highly controversial and brilliantly written show takes you for a ride into the darkest parts of law enforcement that you never thought existed.  This is a show that isn't strictly about good vs. evil; it's about getting your hands dirty in order to get the job done.<br />The show revolves around a police department and the men and women behind it.  They're faced with ugly situations on a day-by-day basis.  A major player is Detective Vic Mackey; the leader of a Strike Team unit that goes places where nobody else would ever want to venture.  Only problem is that in order for the Strike Team to get the job done, they have to bend or break the rules.  Rules that could end up having them become the actual lowlifes that they have dedicated their lives to lock away for good.  With numerous storylines popping up at every corner, one of the key ones is Mackey's superior, Captain Aceveda, looking for any excuse to catch Mackey doing wrong so he can lock him up with the same criminals that he takes down.  The end result of all of these characters and their stories lead to a shockingly entertaining show that ignores every rule in the book and questions your own morality.<br />I found this show to be extremely addicting.  The show is down and dirty, just like some of the shady characters that are in it.  Sometimes you're afraid to watch because you have no idea what buttons the show plans to push next.  This is for sure not &quot;family entertainment.&quot;  With the exception of not being able to use the &quot;F-word,&quot; this show pretty much gets away with everything else.  You'd think it was on HBO.<br />So what's so appealing about this show?  I think it's because of the risks it takes.  Instead of conforming to your typical cop dramas where the lines between good and bad are more than crystal clear, we are presented with a show that tests our morals and values.  It forces you to think and ask yourself, &quot;Would I have done the same thing?&quot;  While a lot of the things that transpires on the show can be viewed as outrageous and over-the-top, there's a lot of ugly truths hidden within.  And, we must remember that this is a TV show with a goal to entertain.  The actors are fantastic in their roles (especially Michael Chiklis, who plays &quot;Vic Mackey&quot;).  The writing and directing also stand out in this well-structured series.<br />The DVD set has some goodies to offer, which will please fans of the show.  This 4-Disc DVD collection includes extras such as commentary on every episode, the original script for the &quot;Pilot&quot; episode, two featurettes, deleted scenes, and cast audition videos.  If the 13 episodes alone weren't enough for you, the extras should make you happy.<br />&quot;The Shield: Season 1&quot; is an excellent show that takes chances by portraying flawed characters that seem much more realistic than most seen in other shows.  It's not for everyone, of course.  The show is brutal and in-your-face.  If you're willing to see how down and dirty a show can get, then this is something to check out.  A very clever show with an extremely promising future.<br />Just how far are you willing to go to get the job done?  You'll soon find out once you pop in the first DVD.

B0000029GA|4.0|I gave it 4 stars, even though the song are worthy a 5 star rating I felt like I couldn't give a 5 mics since the album is so short, it should have been named an EP instead since there are only 9 songs (one is only a intro).<br />I can't deny it, I think that 39 minutes for a rap-album is really cheap. The average hiphop-album is 60 minutes but on the other hand the average hiphop-album aren't as well done as this is. <br />Nas does his best rhymes ever on this cd, and the best songs are &quot;Represent&quot; ,&quot;1 time 4 your mind&quot;, &quot;N.Y. State of Mind&quot; &quot;Memory Lane&quot;... Sh*t there ain't any bad songs on this album...<br />Buy it if your cool with paying fullprice for a half-length album.
0590259385|5.0|This book is great-with a unique finale! At the end it says, \\"My mama's a-Llama! And this is...THE END!\\" In fact, whenever I watch a cartoon that ends with the words, \\"The End\\" onscreen, I recite this story in little bits and towards the end I say, \\"My mama's a llama! And this is...\\" and then the words, \\"The End\\" appear onscreen.
B000002WU9|5.0|This is the only rap/hip-hop c.d. I have ever heard where I can not find a track I hate. Every song is amazing. 2 through 6 are some of the best Wu-Tang songs on any album. Knuckleheadz, Incarcerated Scarfaces, Glaciers of Ice, and Guillotine are the best on the album. The only fault I can find on this album is that there are long intros before every song. If you like anything made by Wu-Tang, The Roots, Nas, Jurassic-5, or Biggie Smalls you will love. Its as good as Illmatic, Ready to Die, and All Eyes on Me. BUY THIS!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Pre-ordering this DVD set, for me, was a no-brainer.  I had seen all of the aired episodes and enjoyed them, then managed to completely fall in love with the characters when the pilot was finally aired (after the show had already been cancelled, which was both depressing and infuriating).  I counted down the days until my DVD's arrived, then began watching them at the first opportunity.<BR>  My 18-year old nephew, who is staying with me, wandered into the room while I was watching an episode.  He must have seen something he liked, because he asked if he could take the first disc into his room to watch on his PS2.  Two hours later he was back, looking concerned.  Apparently he had noticed the air dates printed next to each episode description on the case, and was confused about what order he was supposed to watch them in.  I assured him that he should continue to watch them in the order they came on the DVD, because that's how their creator intended them to be seen, and FOX executives are apparently morons.<BR>   Nobody in the family saw much of the boy over the next two days, as he only came out of his room to eat and to borrow more Firefly discs (cheerfully describing the show as &quot;my new obsession&quot;).  I was so thrilled to see that he was enjoying this fantastic show as much as I was!<BR>  Then came the guilty moment, when my poor nephew showed up at the dinner table looking completely stricken.  &quot;That CAN'T be how it ends!!!&quot;  he moaned.  &quot;Are you sure that's the whole series?&quot;  I had forgotten to warn him that the show was prematurely canceled before the story arcs could reach their conclusions.  We had a great discussion about the show during dinner, and I consoled him by telling him Joss Whedon had vowed to try to continue &quot;Firefly&quot; in SOME venue, possibly a movie.<BR>   It was my nephew who got on the Internet that night and found out that Joss has, indeed, written a script for a &quot;Firefly&quot; movie, and there is agood chance of a movie being made, as long as more executives don't screw up the whole deal again.  In the meantime, we have the DVD's to watch over and over and over again.<BR>   Please buy this DVD!  Do it for your own intense enjoyment, and increase the chance of the movie getting made.  For my poor, darling nephew's sake.<br />&quot;If wishes were horses, we'd all be eating steak!&quot;  --Jayne
B00005221M|2.0|The REAL 1992 version of &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; is a superb film full of terrific history, lovely music, and a great script.  However, in this so-called &quot;expanded edition&quot; much of the dialouge and parts of some great scenes were cut from the real one.  The whole film is very fragmented with this new editing, thus the film is not really &quot;expanded&quot; in the sense that much is added to the film; very much is taken away.  Also, there are scenes added to the film that spoil the pace, the story, and the feeling of the whole film, ruining the triumphant success.  <br />However, if one has never seen the REAL version of this movie he or she should be very pleased with a pretty good movie.  For there was not an incredible amount of this film cut; just enough to destroy the REAL film's power.<br />Also, I was very perturbered that there were no special features included on this DVD--not even the trailer!  This film is one of the greatest movies from the 1990's; I hate to see it go to waste like this.
B00005JMCW|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much. Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan are great. I am disappointed that Lindsay Lohan isn't in any more movies than she is because she is a good young actress and should be used for new future teen movies. Enjoyed it and you should check it out!
B00005JM02|1.0|I did not like this movie at all. At some parts it is so childish that no one over 4 could watch it. Then it would go to something that would be impossible for any child to understand. This made the movie to hard to follow. The only real entertaining part of the movie was Dori the fish because she was extremely funny. Also the beginning was good, but it was far too much for children to handle.
0375422307|5.0|I am a fan of graphic novels, especially ones that can teach me something.  Marjane Satrapi's book did just that.  PLUS, it was fun to read.  Looking forward to her next book already!
B00005JMCW|3.0|I found this movie to be incredibly boring. There were few funny parts to it, while I had expected a whole lot more. Also this is a very childish movie that is not suited for anyone over 9. I gave this move 3 stars because I did like the ending, few funny moments, and the fact that at least it is watchible for SOME age group. Hope this helped.
B000002GLV|5.0|I have one other John Mayall CD called &quot;Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton&quot; and this live set blows that CD away.  Awesome music... the little jazz accents that are sprinkled around from time to time fit fine with the blues foundation.  Get this CD, you won't be disspointed!
B000002MFQ|5.0|This is an excellent CD!  It's relaxing for when you have one of those days... or when you want to hear something nice and instrumental.  By far, the best track is &quot;The Bell&quot; number 7, with the strolling player, aka Alan Rickman!  His voice with Oldfield's Tubular sound makes quite a fascinating listen.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This is by far the best concert DVD I have ever watched!  Not only from the quality of the musicians on stage, the filming and sound, but the emotion that they put into George's songs.  To see Gary Brooker (who I loved in Procol Harum) sing &quot;Old Brown Shoe&quot; and Clapton and McCartney duet on &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; with Ringo on drums ont he same stage is unreal.  This is definitly a &quot;must-have&quot; DVD as this was a once in a lifteime event.  Take time to listen to the entire Indian music segment....it is beautiful and spiritual.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Audioslave - what a great name for a band.  It puts the music first, right where it should be.  And the music is righteous.  After listening to this CD about 300 times, my favorite is Show Me How to Live.  It has absolutely nothing to do with the video.  It has everything to do with the lyrics.  It's about questioning the meaning of life.  And faith in our Maker.  Pretty deep stuff for rock music.  And Like a Stone.  That song still blows me away.  I know exactly what it's about.  No way it's a love song!  And it's not sad, either.  Life goes on, forever.  But the best part is the music.  Every time I hear that song, when it's over, after I've sung every word of it, all I can do is say \\"ahhh...\\"  Chris Cornell has a gift.  Well, more than one, really.  He can sing the s--t out of a song, he can write the lyrics that cut to the bone, and he's easy on the eyes.  <br />Gasoline - love the rhythms, love the guitar, love the echo.  What to say about Tom Morello?  He's the most innovative guitar player since Jimi Hendrix.  Period.  Set It Off?  Love the bass line, love the song, but set what off?  OK, I'm probably being too literal.  Light My Way was a big hit when I saw the band live.  What a great hook.  I Am the Highway is haunting.  I sure would like to see a video.  Definitely one of my favorites.  Exploder is heavy, musically and lyrically.  When I first heard that song, I said, Now, that's Rage Against the Machine.  But it would never have got written without Chris Cornell.  Too bad Audioslave wasn't around when they made Fight Club....<br />Hypnotize is hypnotic.  The sentiment is worthy of U2, but these guys have a different kind of edge.  Getaway Car is the perfect song for driving late at night.  The range of this band is incredible.  This may not be blues in its purest form, but it is at least a bastard child of the blues. I recommend cranking it way up.  Again my hat is off to Tom Morello.  <br />Let's not waste time crying over Soundgarden or Rage Against the Machine.  Audioslave is the best of both worlds.  (No disrespect to Zack de la Rocha.) Truth is, there's not a bad song on this CD.  There's 9 great ones and the other 5 are better than average.  It beats listening to the garbage you hear on the radio. That's why I haven't taken this CD out of my car stereo yet.
B000001F45|5.0|The follow-up album to \\"Demons and Wizards\\", recorded in the same year, and while still touring constantly (a grueling pace that was to lead to problems down the road for many of the members), this album maintains the quality of its legendary predecessor.<br />\\"Rain\\" is a beautiful ballad, delivered perfectly and subtly by the now sadly overlooked David Byron, one of the greatest singers in rock history (all of Byron's works should be required listening for modern vocalists, he was a master of dynamics, an art that has been sadly lost in recent years). \\"Sweet Lorraine\\" is incredibly catchy ear candy, and was the radio standard from the album. \\"Tales\\", \\"Blind Eye\\" and \\"Echoes In The Dark\\" are moody, mystical, ominous, and emotionally moving, with Byron's vocal performance particularly shining on them as well. \\"Spider Woman\\" is a bit of a throw-away, but plenty of fun, with some excellent slide guitar work from Ken Hensley.<br />Which leaves the album's opening and closing tracks: \\"Sunrise\\", the opener, was the first Heep song I ever heard, and led me to become a lifelong fan; the group's trademark vocal harmonies have possibly never been so well displayed as on this song, which became a long-time concert opener. The title track, which closes the album, is an epic, multi-sectional tour-de-force, with an excellent, blistering, extended guitar and drum duet by Mick Box and Lee Kerslake in the middle, and some amazing vocals from both the aforementioned Mssrs. Byron and Hensley. A more than worthy successor to \\"Demons and Wizards\\", and a must-have album for Heepsters or classic rock fans in general.<br />Oh, and for the few obnoxious reviewers of this album who felt the need to compare it derisively to Spinal Tap for the fantasy-oriented lyrics, I have two observations:<br />1) It was recorded in 1972, when virtually *every* British band, including the universally acknowledged gods of Heavy Metal, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, were visiting various fantasy realms lyrically on virtually every song. To continue to slag Uriah Heep for being a product of their time in that respect, especially when similar bands who were doing exactly the same thing (and were similarly villified for it at the time) are now regarded as geniuses, is just petty and mean-spirited. Personally, I find the fantasy themes charming, in a Tolkienesque way. YMMV.<br />2) For all the deliberate silliness of their lyrics, Spinal Tap is an excellent band from a musical standpoint: Guest, McKean, and Shearer are all extremely proficient at their respective instruments, and their compositional skills are top-notch, so comparing bands to them is not quite as insulting as musically clueless would-be critics might think.ally on virtually every song.

B0000DJZA5|4.0|Some of the differences between this version of Let It Be and the original version are so subtle and esoteric that only the most rabid Beatles fans would notice. The rest of the differences are more obvious, and only the most rabid Beatles fans would care.<br />It so happens that I *am* a rabid Beatles fan, so both the subtle and obvious differences catch my attention.<br />At first I was a bit put off by this version. While it purports to &quot;strip down&quot; the Spectorian &quot;wall of sound,&quot; it also ironically strips away a lot of the raw feel of the original Let It Be. Gone are the random chatters and guitar pluckings that introduce and conclude many of the original tracks. Gone are many of the peculiar results of the live takes such as Ringo's snares rattling during the guitar intro to &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; -- a song that didn't even appear on the original release.<br />Eventually, I realized the intent of this exercise was to theorize about how the album would have sounded had the Beatles and George Martin overseen the final creative process. And a tidied-up version not unlike this one probably would have been the result. Once I accepted this premise, I warmed up to &quot;Naked&quot; a bit more. That and I've been waiting 15 years for a completed mix of the 3-part harmony version of &quot;Don't Let Me Down.&quot; Alas, this album finally delivers. <br />On the one hand I appreciate the de-Spectorization of many of the tracks. On the other, I miss the raw energy and the &quot;sounds like you're there&quot; aspect that stems from the original version's live takes and resultant studio banter/tomfoolery. I can't say I like this version better than the original, but I can say it's a rather intriguing take on the whole Let It Be project.
0385504209|5.0|I had a terrible time putting this book down!  I read chapters before work, after work, in the car picking up kids...everywhere I could.  Dan Brown's tale about the search for the Holy Grail is fast paced and never boring.  The surprises just keep coming.  The biggest surprises are who the &quot;Teacher&quot; is and where the Grail is located.  Dan Brown obviously uses a lot of historical facts and suppositions to weave his tale.  Whether or not you believe in what he writes it will certainly make you question the beginnings of the modern Church if only for a second.  The only thing that upset me about this book is that it had to end!
B00008PW2D|4.0|I absolutely love Sex and the City and look forward to watching it every Sunday night.  I do admit that when I first noticed the price of the box set, I was a bit surprised, but seriously the price isn't that bad.  Yes, it's only 8 episodes, but that's basically what I am paying HBO right now every month to watch 4 episodes, considering you get 4 episodes a month, so just think of it that you are getting 4 episodes for free!!  Makes me feel better!!!
0345452577|3.0|In a departure from his Alex Delaware series, Jonathan Kellerman introduces us to Dr. Jeremy Carrier. Dr. Carrier is emotionally traumatized by the death of his girlfriend. She is brutally murdered and Jeremy becomes a prime suspect in her death. He is the staff psychologist at City Central Hospital. There he gets drawn into a unexpected and rather bizarre friendship with pathologist Dr. Arthur Chess. More murders ensue with the police focusing on Jeremy. Dr. Chess slips away supposedly to go on vacation. He leaves Jeremy what amounts to pieces of a puzzle that will help solve the spate of recent killings and to help clear Jeremy of suspicion.<br />I always look forward to Jonathan Kellerman novels. The Alex Delaware series is one of my favorites. I had really high expectations for this book. The first half of the book really dragged. I never connected to any of the characters. The plot was undeveloped. Luckily the second half of the book got more interesting and a bit more suspenseful. Once Jeremy started solving the puzzle Dr. Chess was sending him, the plot really improved and Kellerman's skills were once again evident. The last quarter of the book was a page-turner, unfortunately I expected so much more.<br />First ½ of book: 1 star<br />Third ¼ or book: 3 stars<br />Fourth ¼ of book: 5 stars
B00005NWM3|2.0|I bought the album for two reasons; my good friend suggested it and it was cheap at the time.  Good thing that it was cheap, because I'd throw it away if it weren't for the 3 or so good songs.  Silver Side Up is what I consider a pothole in Nickelback's career, it's just a step or two lower in quality than the other albums that they have put forth.  <BR>Musically, its just about average with tracks that sound awfully similar to other artists and to other songs on the very same album. Seems a little desperate doesn't it, having to put the same stuff on the SAME album, only changing tempo and lyrics.  Speaking of lyrics, they weren't that great either, with the exception of the overplayed radio hit &quot;How you Remind me&quot;, &quot;Just For&quot;, and the TRULY great last song &quot;Good times Gone.&quot; That last song is the best possible ending for the wasted album, giving you hope for a better one next time.<BR>Folks, don't waste your money (unless it's dirt cheap)in going to get this. With this album on the market, Nickelback's reputation has indefinately lowered and the good times of their previous albums have faded away into the past.
B000076CY6|4.0|For the money, buy the smaller sets.  You get the same amount of larger bricks as in the big buckets, and less smaller bricks.  For the same price as 1 big box, you get a lot more bigger bricks by buying 2 small boxes.
B00008ADPF|4.0|Everyone either likes or hates Nickelback, but this album might convert some of those haters out there.  This being O SO MUCH BETTER than Silver Side Up, many of us are relieved to know that the band has not started a landslide in their career.  I guess you could say that in this case the 4th time's the charm. <BR>As for the acutal songs, most of them are 'pure', however some do sound a lot alike.  The first track, &quot;Flat on the Floor&quot;, is very very short and sounds exactly like a faster tempo of the song &quot;Money Bought&quot; on Silver Side Up.  Other than that, I have nothing to complain about. My personal favorites are &quot;Someday&quot;, &quot;Believe it or not&quot;, Feelin' way too damn good&quot;, and &quot;Figured you out&quot;.  <BR>If you get the version with the three extra bonus tracks (which is a very good idea if you can find it), you will find the single &quot;Learn the Hard Way&quot;, which is also on the Daredevil movie soundtrack.  This song is reason enough for you to go out and get the version with the bonus tracks, but instead, you get three great songs.<BR>This whole album is the best of anything i have heard Nickelback,(save a few singles from the past) and Chad Kroeger has done a fantastic job of producing the most meaningful lyrics that I have heard of in this band.  Overall, for those of you who have Silver Side Up, you are hearing a much more controlled and mature sound.  For the rest of the general population, get this album and hear the messages from the men who have chosen The Long Road.
B0000029DD|5.0|Jeff Buckley<BR>\\"Grace\\"<BR>Columbia Records, 1994<br /> \\"She's just a tear that hangs inside my soul forever.\\"  An example of just some of the haunting lyrics that are constant throughout Grace.  Folk-Rocker Jeff Buckley's debut, and unfortunately, his only album released during his lifetime.  An eclectic mix of folk and rock, \\"Grace\\" is not only a collection of songs, but more of an autobiography of Jeff's life.  From the edgy-rocking \\"Eternal Life\\" (about losing his father at such a young age.) or  \\"Last Goodbye\\" (a love-and-lost song that most of us can relate too.)  This album is a collection of originals and covers.  Jeff covers such artists as Leonard Cohen (\\"Hallelujah\\") and Nina Simone. (\\"Lilac Wine\\")<BR> Released in 1994, during the middle of the \\"grunge\\" movement, \\"Grace\\" was a step apart from the long-haired, dirty sounds of such bands as Nirvana and Alice In Chains.  It went unnoticed at first, \\"Last Goodbye\\" being the only hit single.  In the end, \\"Grace\\" only sold about 250,000 copies in the United States, but it's impact cannot be measured by just the sales alone.  Buckley's voice was often compared compared to a \\"softer\\" Robert Plant by critics and even resembled his own father, folk singer Tim Buckley.<BR> Starting off with a mellow \\"Mojo Pin\\", starts off the perfect mood for the record.  The musicians accompanying Jeff, Matt Johnson on drums, Mick Grondahl on bass guitar, and Michael Tighe on guitar, perform on their instruments exactly what each song demands.  Following \\"Mojo Pin\\" comes the first of Jeff's uptempo songs, called \\"Grace\\".  With a combination of mysterious lyrics and an outstanding vocal performace, by Jeff, this is one of the stand out tracks on the album.  Next comes the song that most people probably first heard Jeff from (it was featured in the \\"Vanilla Sky\\" soundtrack, for example.) a somewhat uplifting song about love, loss, and the road to recovery.  This is the song that personally made me a fan of Buckley's work.  The fourthsong is one of three cover songs, the Nina Simone song \\"Lilac Wine.\\"  Featuring what Jeff does best and the mellow playing of his band-mates, this struck me as powerful.  Not only in the songwriting aspect of it, but the overall delivery.<BR> Speeding things up a little, the record continues with \\"So Real\\" a moody rocker with an improvisational feel to it.  This song leads up to what in my opinion is the absolute finest song on the record, one of the finest songs ever recorded.  This is Jeff's cover of the Leonard Cohen song \\"Hallelujah\\".  Coming in at just under 7 minutes, \\"Hallelujah\\" has the GREATEST vocals I have ever heard on any song, from any artist.<BR>\\"Grace\\" continues off with a melancholic love tune, \\"Lover, you should've come over\\"  while somewhat depressing, this song grew on me not immediately, but over time.  Don't be ashamed if this one causes you to shed a few tears.  Next off, we have a song that features just Jeff and a guitar (not unlike \\"Hallelujah\\") called \\"Corpus Christi Carol\\" it was originally written by Benjamin Britten.  It has a choir-boy quality to it.  The last 2 songs, \\"Eternal Life\\" &amp; \\"Dream Brother\\" are both about his father, who died when Jeff was young.<BR> There you have it.  10 absolute masterpieces on one album.  Tales of tragedy and loss, Hope and love.  In my opinion, the single greatest album of the 1990's<BR>Rating: ********** (out of 5)
B000028U0Y|5.0|Johnny Cash's &quot;At Folsom Prison&quot; was my first album by Johnny Cash and is still my favorite. It was also the first real country album I owned before then, outside of Bob Dylan's &quot;Nashville Skyline&quot; and The Byrds &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo,&quot; and before then I wouldn't touch country music with a ten foot pole. I recieved this album as a gift and it opened a whole new world for me. It transcends musical genres and is just simply wonderful music. Johnny Cash was a beautiful man who never forgot where he came from and treated prisoners who were just like him, as human beings. The songs on this album are straight from the heart and played with such conviction and love. If you love great music, then your music collection is incomplete without this album.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|I've been waiting for this record for over 30 years and it pretty much delivers. <br />Make no mistake, this is the &quot;original&quot; version of the album and the 1970-released version is the &quot;tampered&quot; version.<br />The sound is the way it should be, without the nonsensical orchestrations and choirs. The track order is far better. Heck, the track selection is an improvement. The babbling between songs is gone.<br />My major complaint is that this album should have been called &quot;Get Back&quot; and used the original &quot;Get Back&quot; artwork.
B00006BTCA|3.0|I bought this CD because it was suggested by Amazon while I was researching Radiohead and other bands of that ilk. I've listened to this CD more than a few times now (it usually takes at least 2 or 3 listens before somebody can tell if they like the CD.) After absorbing it in it's entirety a few times, I still can't say &quot;I like it&quot; necessarily. There are some good tracks (no. 1, &quot;Untitled&quot;, is one of them), but there are also some true duds as well (something about &quot;200 couches&quot;.) Track 5 reminds me of &quot;This Charming Man&quot; by The Smiths (but Interpol is definitely not a Smith sound-alike band.) The lead singer's voice vaguely annoys me, too.<BR>Not bad, but really not that good either. If I could do it all over again, I wouldn't have bought this one.
0807282375|5.0|i'm not one to write alot so i will get to the point. I have never been so moved by a book in my life than by the final conclusion of this serious, the AMBER SPYGLASS. OH MY GOD. This ending is both tragic and wonderful. To be honest it made me cry, something i dont do. Honestly i never thought a book could move me so. What a great ending to a great trilogy.
B00005Y1MT|5.0|BRAVE is a both beautiful & complete album. There are moments on this album of such a musical perfection and sensitivity, only compared with masterpieces like Misplaced Childhood or Clutching at Straws. Having moments of this calibre, they suggest us to play it \\"loud with the lights off\\"... but even at daylight I love listening to BRAVE. The final couple of songs - \\"The Great Escape\\" and \\"Made Again\\", are the highlights for me but this album is to be enjoyed since the very first second.  Absolutely indispensable for every fan of the band.
B00005JM02|5.0|good movie which ranks with the toy story series
B000002U82|5.0|This is the definitive Pink Floyd album. If I had to choose a best Pink Floyd album, this would be it. I also recomend the Dark Side of the Moon DVD.
B000088E6D|5.0|Rarely do I find CD's where I like pretty much every song on it.  This is one.  Michael adds his own touch to the songs so he doesn't sound as if he is copying anyone, but he doesn't change them so much that they sound strange.
B0000DJZ7W|5.0|This is talent music writing mixed with that incredible voice.<BR>This is different style compared with the  &quot;titanic&quot; song, wilder, more guitar but arranged to suit her style.<BR>Back to basic really, she can put her Titanic style on the side without breaking it and I think this is what she did VERY  SUCCESSFULLY.<BR>Dont get me wrong she still goes for those breathtaking high notes but in french she seems to go that extra stronger.<BR>I come back to the music writing it is the most talented 4 guys in the french speaking worlds that participated to this album.<BR>Something else yes humberto gattica who mixes most of her album (he also produced the superb song &quot;us&quot;) there he is again and great job, the mixing is PERFECT.<BR>This album is very mixed with style they all have a strong different color.<BR>To finnish the voice well, after her two year break her first album left me as cold as ice, she is back with a clear, powerfull voice reaching notes most of us can only dream of.<br />Having all her albums I can say that this album is more than worth it, it is a must for all Celine's fans.<br />Enjoy !<br />Laurent
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|Pretty much every song is catchy and enjoyable.  Everytime I thought about skipping to the next song, it hooked me.  No hits like but an okay sophomore effort.  Could be worse, right?
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This concert blew me away! All the best musicians in one beautiful place, playing the music of  their beautiful friend and someone who has given so much to all of us through his music. This tribute to George Harrison is more moving than I could have ever expected... You will cry, smile, laugh, sing and dance along with all who were there to celebrate the life and music of George. The Concert for George is much more than a dvd...it is a true heartfelt experience in JOY and LOVE.
B00012FXB8|4.0|A previous reviewer gave a brief description of the original Vincent Ward script for Alien 3.  In it he mentions that Ward had Ripley crash landing on a wooden planet inhabited by monks who rejected technology and therefore they had no capability to fight the alien.  The reviewer says that this script would have been &quot;amazing&quot;.  Yeah, amazingly stupid.  A wooden planet???  This idea not only sounds stupid but it physically impossible. As anybody that knows anything about celestial bodies is that there's only two types of planetoids.  Rock-based or Gas-based.  Even a water or ice-covered planet has a rock mantle.  If Alien 3 would have been made with this script, it would have been the laughing stock of an otherwise great franchise up to this point.<br />But as Alien 3 turns out with Fincher's eventual direction, it not all that bad of a film.  Yeah, the theatrical cut was a bit disjointed with loose ends and missing parts, but this is something that the new working print has supposedly fixed to some degree.  While still not a perfect film, anything is better than this original wooden planet idea.
B00008PX8P|5.0|THIS DVD IS EXCELLENT, I HAVE WATCHED IT OVER 130 HOURS AND CAN'T STOP WATCHING IT...I LOVE IT, IT IS LED ZEPPELIN AT IT'S BEST, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!! IT IS A VERY SEXY CONCERT AND WILL INSPIRE A WHOLE NEW LIFE FOR YOU AND YOUR LOVED ONES!!!<BR>IT IS A MUST HAVE FOR ALL LED ZEPPELIN AND JIMMY PAGE FANS...
B000002UDD|5.0|This album is one of my favorites in the Megadeth Library with songs like hook in mouth and in my darkest hour, how could it not?  So far, so good....so what is extremly raw, not like the polished sounds of their future releases, this album is more darker and has an atomsphere of pure hatred.  That why I love it so.  <BR>some fans of Megadeth don't really dig this album, I don't know why.  but if your just getting into Megadeth I would not recommend buying this album first, try Rust in peace, than buy this album.  Dave Mustaine=god!
0156027321|4.0|Since it I has been almost a year ago that I read Life of Pi, my review will not be a detailed one. I just want to tell anyone who may begin reading this book that it does move quite slowly in the beginning. If you stick it out, you will be glad you did read it. It leaves everything to the imagination and answers almost nothing. It is not like any other book that I have read, but you will be left with a good feeling in the end.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I only got to see part of one show when it aired and to tell the truth, I did not get hooked. Not sure why, but after having seen the entire box set now, I am a fan. I like Joss Whedon's style and approach to this mixed genre. I have also enjoyed his work with Buffy and Angel. The extras on the last DVD are great too, I just wish they had included everyone's video audition instead of only Alan Tudyk's. Great show, excellent buy.
B0000E6I1J|4.0|Tremendous songs performed by an equally tremendous &quot;band&quot;.  Considering how many performers were on stage, it is unbelievable how tight they were. These guys are incredible pros, who were very very well prepared.  &quot;Something&quot;, and &quot;WMGGW&quot; are absolutely incredible.  No clunkers, but vocals on &quot;Wah Wah&quot; are a bit lacking, and while there was nothing wrong with &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, it was just &quot;OK&quot; (Sorry Sir P.). DVD is even better.<br />With the enormous quality, quantity and diversity of talent on the stage, I wish they tackled &quot;Within You Without You&quot;, but I guess you can't have everyhting.<br />NOTE TO AMAZON:  GET MORE REPRESENTATIVE MUSIC SAMPLES, YOU DID NOT MAKE THE BEST CHOICES, BY A LONG SHOT!!
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Britney's fourth album is here, but I must say that I was expecting something better. After \\"Britney\\", her third album, sold fewer copies than her first two albums, I thought Britney was going to come back with an album that would become very important in the history of pop music such as Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\". I really did. When I listened to the first single, \\"Me Against The Music\\", I thought that this album might have the chance, but when I listened to the whole album, I saw it hard for this album to be as successful as her first two albums. It may just be that I was expecting too much. <br />Below is a quick track-by-track review.<br />1. \\"Me Against The Music\\" - (5/5 pts.) I'm sure everyone has listened to this song, which features Madonna. Pretty good and catchy party song.<br />2. \\"(I Got That) Boom Boom\\" - (4/5 pts.) Features Ying Yang Twings. This is a more hip hop song. Cool beat.<br />3. \\"Showdown\\" - (4/5 pts.) A very hot song with very sexy lyrics. Good for parties.<br />4. \\"Breathe On Me\\" - (5/5 pts.) This is a very different song with very mature lyrics. It has a cool beat. Strong lyrics.<br />5. \\"Early Mornin'\\" - (3/5 pts.) Here's the Moby song. Another sexy song with a really good beat. Pretty catchy, even though Britney's voice sounds as if she had bearly woken up from a long sleep.<br />6. \\"Toxic\\" - (5/5 pts.) This song could become a hit. It has good lyrics and an excellent beat.<br />7. \\"Outrageous\\" - (4/5 pts.) Another get-up-and-dance song. The song is good, the lyrics are not impressing, and by this point of the album you get kind of tired of listening to songs like this one.<br />8. \\"Touch Of My Hand\\" - (4/5 pts.) Good song. It has a slower beat, but the lyrics are good.<br />9. \\"The Hook Up\\" - (4/5 pts.) Good song with cool beat. It kind of reminds me of Beyoncé's \\"Baby Boy\\".<br />10. \\"Shadow\\" - (4/5 pts.) One of the two ballads in the album. I like the lyrics in this song.<br />11. \\"Brave New Girl\\" - (5/5 pts.) Could become a hit. Ilike the rap verses in this song. One of my favorite songs.<br />12. \\"Everytime\\" - (5/5 pts.) This ballad could become a hit. It's too slow and soft and the lyrics are sad.<br />13. \\"Me Against The Music [Rishi Rich's Desi Kulcha Remix]\\" - (5/5 pts.) Excellent remix. Makes you want to dance even more.<br />The reason I gave this album only 3 stars is because I was expecting much more from Britney. I mean, this album is packed with great beats, but this album is basically a party album. Britney wants everyone to dance to her music. If Britney wants an excellent album, she needs to start working with better producers. So if you're looking for a good party album, this will do.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is, without a doubt, one of the best things to ever air on television.  It is emotionally resonant without being melodramatic, artistic without being pretentious and philosophical sans berets and body odure (good ol' Capt. Tightpants almost seems to embody Kant's categorical imperative).  Even its flaws (calico in space? WTF?!?) work.  And this is coming from a person with little patience for ordinary scifi.  With very few exceptions (Bradbury, Butler, Verne), most scifi/fantasy strikes me as having been crafted by thumbless monkeys.  Too one-dimensional and no artistry at all, not in the sense of Nabokov, Toni Morrison or Faulkner.  'Star Trek' I enjoy purely as camp. But this is different.  \\"Jaynestown\\" made me laugh so hard (thank you mr. edlund, you demi-goddish type fella. Spoon!)and in \\"Objects in Space\\" River's speech, her selfless concern amidst her own confusion and pain, broke my heart, if only for a moment. Yet what separates this show from all others is its understanding that, just like life, funny can be serious and the serious absurd.  Just look at how each of the aforementioned episodes ends.  <BR>How fitting that this noble show ended with a sharp joke...

B0000BWVCM|5.0|It's rule of thumb sequels rarely equal the original.  Even when they do, the fans are general a bit jaded, knowing what to expect on the second go around, so even if it is as good, it's not as fresh.  Expectations can really hurt a film.  Everyone is so excited they often expect MORE, and so are let down no matter how good the film is.  So going in, sequels have a hard road.  When one is as good it's rare; when it's BETTER that is unbelievable.  WEll, believe it - X 2 is even better.<br />The characters are set, so this film gives the chance to explore them a little deeper.  Glad to say the whole cast is back.  Super fun to see Gandolf being a bad guy!  Ian McKellan is back as Magneto the mutant who sees the destruction of mankind as the only way for the mutants to survive.  Patrick Stewart is Professor Charles Xavier, the kindly mentor who has a safe haven for mutants and works for their betterment for all.  Back also are Hugh Jackman as Logan/Wolverine; Halle Berry magnificent as Storm; Famke Janssen as Jean Grey and Bruce Davison as Senator Kelly .  Also, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Mystique, Magneto's new sidekick, Brian Cox (the first Hannibal Lector) as Striker, his mutant killer Yuriko Oyama is played well by Kelly Hu and super addition is Alan Cumming as Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler.  The whole cast does a wonderful job.<br />When we last saw Magneto, he'd been imprisoned within a plastic jail, since any metal can be reformed and used by him.  Everyone was happy at the school run by Xavier, while Logan was off trying to figure out his past.  The Senator was now a mutant.<br />After the Nightcrawler attacks the president in a protest for Mutant's rights, Striker is able to pressure the president into a campaign against Xavier's School, playing right into Magneto's plans.  Short order, Mystique has Magneto free, but Xavier has been taken by Strike who is trying to manipulate him into killing all the mutants.  Thus in a switch, the good mutants must work with Magneto to free Xavier.<br />It's lightning pace, wonderful effects, great fight scenes and stronger character development.  It's just an outstanding action flick that leaves you hungry for X 3!!to free Xavier.<br />It's lightning pace, wonderful effects, great fight scenes and stronger character development.

B0000C6E4D|5.0|I honestly can't find one negative thing about &quot;Afterglow.&quot;  Every cut is unique in it's own way, and amazing for that matter.  If I had to make a stretch and give one criticism, I would say that there aren't enough up-beat tunes.  But, like I said, that would be a stretch.  If you don't have this album yet, you need to go out and get it.  You'll be impressed!

B00006CXXU|4.0|When did this CD come out? A year and a half ago?  And I'm still listening to it.  I'm pretty critical of pop music in general because it is marketed to the masses.  What I've found to be the common thread with most of the reviews that I've read on here about &quot;Stripped&quot; is the appeal of this album to the individual.  Each reviewer has emphasized that he or she has related to many of her songs on this CD, and who am I to argue?  Christina and her team of writers and collaborators have successfully accomplished what they set out to do.  Christina has said that she wants the listener to feel like he or she is right in the studio with her, and that's how I feel when I listen to this CD.  As a person, I too can relate to the messages that she has conveyed in her music.  I've been knocked down before, called ugly, been wronged by a boy... Christina artfully compiles life lessons and the challenges of growing and defeat into 20 tracks.<br />I do have a few criticisms about the CD as a whole.  A few reviewers said not to judge the whole CD by &quot;Dirrty,&quot; and don't, but I would like to see a couple more songs like Dirrty.  It has a great beat!  There really is a lack of dance songs on the CD.  Most of the ballads and midtempo songs are wonderful, but nothing can replace a song that makes you want to get up and dance.  Christina also has yet to find her voice.  Yes, the CD is a mix of different genres, and that's good, but to me it feels jumbled together.  The song &quot;Make Over&quot; just confuses me.  It's very over produced.<br />My top songs for the album are as follows: 5) &quot;Dirrty,&quot; 4) &quot;Cruz&quot; and &quot;I'm Okay.&quot; 3) &quot;Can't Hold Us Down,&quot; 2) &quot;Fighter,&quot; 1) &quot;Beautiful.&quot;
B00008EY7H|5.0|My expertise, limited, but here it is.  I've seen &quot;Mystere&quot; and &quot;O&quot; in person.  I own &quot;Saltimbanco&quot; and I own &quot;Alegria&quot;, soon to own &quot;Quidam&quot;.   Ratings I give &quot;O&quot; an 10, &quot;Mystere&quot; a 9.5, &quot;Saltimbanco&quot; a negative three ( -3)it really sucked, and &quot;Alegria&quot; a 9.  <BR>Alegria was fantastic.  The music was superb and singers get the highest of marks.  Their voices and presentation were as dramatic as the athletic performers.  The costumes were astounding, at times taking the viewer to another world/dimension. As always, the performers were at the top of their game.  I find it nearly impossible to say what the best acts were as they all brought a significant contribution to the show.  No bad ones.  The clowns were extremley amusing showing both great mime like ablities and deep humor.  The camera work was five stars.  I hope that if and when &quot;O&quot; or &quot;mystere&quot; are put on tape/dvd, that it is handled by the same group.  If you are ready to go to another world and be put in a perpetual state of awe, then this is the dvd for you.  Five stars.
B000089RVX|4.0|Overall \\"Fallen\\" is a pretty good pop (or pop rock) music, with quite interesting lyrics. It is an easy listening music which recalled me of Linden Park, Cranberries, or even Roxette style (I would say however that Cranberries and Roxette had a bit more rock in their music than Evanescence in \\"Fallen\\"). <br />Some people in this forum gave small ratings, rather based on the fact they expected gothic or heavy metal. I don't know which track from \\"Fallen\\" really has any gothic or heavy metal component in it, but \\"Fallen\\" sounds almost pop-rock for me, and it is quite good in this perspective. Because is an easy listening music the audience is expected to be large, especially teenagers, however Fallen may not target hard-core heavy (or gothic) metal guys.<br />If a typical pop (pop rock) album has today one or two good songs, Fallen has almost 6 pleasant tunes. I said \\"almost\\" 6 because \\"Bring me to life\\" has a problem: it is excellent in first half and horrible when someone there (a male voice) start to mix some kind of rap or something, destroying and making insupportable the rest of the tune. The best songs in order of my preferences are:<BR>1) Imaginary 2) Whisper 3) Tourniquet 4) My Immortal 5) Going Under 6) first half of \\"Bring me to life\\"<BR>To have six good tunes out of 11 in only one album is quite impressing today. <br />Even if live performances of Amy Lee seems rather disappointing to me, the studio recording of her vocals are quite good and almost makes everything for \\"Fallen\\". <br />However, right now I cannot listen any more Evanescence. This is how I digest pop (pop-rock) stuff: I initially like it but I just cannot listen it too many times. I don't expect Fallen will pas the test of time, it might be in fashion for a while and forgotten shortly.<br />Overall \\"Fallen\\" a pretty album, and it deserves 4/5 if one look at it from pop-rock perspective.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|It's really a shame that this new album is on track to be her worst selling record to date, because it is truly the best work that she has put forward. Brit had a hand in writing most of the songs on this album, and it is a nice change to hear her belt out a tune that is close to her heart. We have all heard about the \\"Justin song\\", which is the second to the last track titled, \\"Everytime\\". Yet I haven't heard tell of the song \\"Shadow\\" that is heartwrenching and obviously about a true love lost. \\"Toxic\\" is an awesome dance song with a great beat. The two overtly sexual songs \\"Touch Of My Hand\\" and \\"Breathe On Me\\" are seductive and lulling as well as tastefully done. Pure mood music. The maturity of these two songs is apparent and relatable to women of all ages. \\"The Hook Up\\" is her first attempt at rapping and is quite catchy, a club song that you can really shake your ass to. I highly suggest this album, even if you are not a Britney fan. She has put forth a tremendous effort and it shows. Give the girl a chance, it's well worth the money.
B00005Q66T|5.0|CAN'T DISRESPECT THE BEST SINGER EVER, I LOVE ALL THE SONGS HERE, BUT, WHERE IS 'RAIN', 'BAD GIRL', 'THIS USED TO BE MY PLAYGROUND', 'FEVER', 'I'LL REMEMBER', 'NOTHING REALLY MATTERS', 'YOU'LL SEE' and 'I WANT YOU'? I wanted all of MADONNA'S hits, but, just like IMMACULATE COLLECTION, we only get 85% of the tracks we love. Where are the others...I dunno, but I'm hoping Madonna will have a 2 disc set SOON with all 50 something of her singles, because like with both her greatest hits cd's together, like 11 of her singles were missing altogether. 'Dress U up', 'Causing a commotion', 'WHOS THAT GIRL?', 'LOVE DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE' and 'BURNING UP', AND EVEN 'EVERYBODY', 'OH FATHER', 'DEAR JESSIE', 'TRUE BLUE' were missing from the IMMACULATE COLLECTION and GHV2...so Madonna, put all your hits and don't leave any out next time.  And the new 2 DISC SET that might come out this year'll hopefully have 'American Life' and 'Me against the music' on it, oh, and HOLLYWOOD...yeah...
B0000DD7LB|4.0|For the record, I think it's funny that people are continuously comparing Christina and Britney.  Maybe you could with their debut albums, but both of these artists have taken two drastically different paths since 1999.  <br />First of all, no, Britney does not have a Mariahesque voice.  What Britney does have is the marketing skills of Madonna and the ever elusive image of sexy and sweet.  It is this dichotomy that makes Britney a corporate phenom.  As far as talent goes, yes, she has talent.  No, she's not a power ballad singer, but she can carry a tune.  That's more than I can say for myself.   It seems as if she has found the range that suits her vocal skills on this album.  Since I only own \\"Britney,\\" besides this one, I can say that she stretched her range way too far on that album to the point of straining.  <br />I went out on a limb by giving \\"In the Zone\\" four stars, but now that I think of it, it's appropriate.  I like the CD.  I listen to it a lot; I tap my foot to the music and sing along in the car.  Isn't that what music is about?  This album is fun, overtly sexual at times, but fun.  The album isn't too personal, but that's not what Britney intended it be.  It's a good blend of electronica, hip hop, and R&B, nothing more and nothing less.<br />I had a few qualms about this CD.  I felt a lot of the songs blended together.  Britney placed both of her ballads towards the end of the CD, leaving the more uptempo and R&B in the beginning.  I felt like it was just one after another.  A ballad at the beginning would've been welcome.  This brings me to my other criticism; this CD needs maybe one more ballad.  The two that she placed on the CD were excellent.  I want to hear more of that side of Britney!<br />Here are my top songs for \\"In the Zone\\": 5) \\"Showdown,\\" 4) \\"Brave New Girl,\\" 3) \\"Shadow,\\" 2) \\"Toxic,\\" 1) \\"Everytime.\\"
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is my second review of \\"In The Zone\\" but I felt that I had to make a point...again.  For those that say Britney can't sing...she would not have gotten a record deal if she couldn't.  Just look at those old videos of her singing at talent shows and weddings...she is clearly talented.  As she grew older, her voice deteriorated but it is not bad by any means.  It's a perfectly listenable voice, while it may not have the strength and power of Christina Aguilera's, so what?  Britney doesn't sing those typical R&B powerhouse vocal songs, nor does she need to.  Britney claims to be an entertainer, not a singer.  There is nothing wrong with recording fast-paced dance songs to make you feel good and energetic.  And as for her sexual aspects, it's all for entertainment, it surely has you haters talking.  Britney-haters have no effect on Britney, but they sure made her popular by gossiping.  That's what Britney wanted, and she got it.  Thanks, y'all.  ;-)
0780020685|5.0|This movie is beyond praise. It's one of the best ever and set the standard for so many others that have tried but can't quite duplicate it's power. I don't know what those who gave this movie a low rating are even thinking. I doubt there even old enough to really appreciate good cinema. Special effect ladden movies are so run of the mill and too common. To have a movie that actually has a plot these days is very very rare. For any real movie fan this is a definite must have!!!
B000002LLC|4.0|The 40's had great Jazz music, and Madonna's 40's themed CD 'I'm BrEATHLESS' iNSpired by the blockbuster hit DICK TRACY, all the songs are well done. Many say Vogue didn't belong on this CD, but, it actually fits, it has a kind of classic vibe in it, and VOGUE is like one of the biggest hit songs of the past 14 years or so. It was number 1 on dance charts for like 18 weeks. Unlike 'Hanky Panky', which is considered to some Maddy fans her worst single ever, the track barely entered the top 50 for a weeks time...sad, but life must move on...Nowadays you can see Madonna as a military chick rapping with a soy lat'e, but, the Jazz phaze from this CD was cool too.

0679879269|5.0|This series is a personal, absolute favorite of mine, among others. Obviously beautifully and glorifully (is that a word?) written, and the character developement is stunning. I cried completely (balling my eyes out!) at the end, and at the part with Mrs. Coulter, Lord Asriel, and Metatron. Should NOT pass up a chance to read. I've reread it many times, and it's never lost its novelty. GO TO YOUR STORE AND BUY IT TODAY! -Middle school reader (an avid one at that)
0553274503|4.0|Flowers for Algernon was a very unique book, and I have never read anything of the like. It was an amazing story, one which I greatly enjoyed. Although not one of the best books I have ever read, it can easily be compared to many of my favorites. It's a book that makes you think, that creates many feelings inside of you. A book that leaves you without a sense of fulfillment, that there should be something more, that you want more. Many of the most brilliant stories I have ever read end like this, one of the reasons that makes it so magical. The ending leaves you begging for more, except that there is none. You have to create any more from your own imagination. If you have no imagination, then this kind of story would be near pointless for you to read. But, if you are one of those with a very avid imagination, then Flowers for Algernon would be a perfect book for you. It is not a diffucult book, and would probably take you only a few days to read or less, but is has a story that you will think over and remember for years to come.
B0000C7PRY|1.0|I hate this disc for the same reason I thought Snow was the worst disc ever by Spock's Beard (and I really, really liked SB until that disc...honestly).  Terribly awkward lyrics, clichd prog licks...simply embarrassing.   This is prog rock for people that didn't actually grow up with old-school prog rock like ELP, KC, Yes and old Genesis.  Awful, just awful.   Throw your $ in the street instead of buying this...you'll end up feeling better about yourself in the long run.  I'm sure we'll see poor Neal on the PAX channel before too long.  No wait, even they'll think this sucks.
B0000025T6|4.0|I bought this album about two weeks ago and it hasnt left the changer yet.From the chilling harmonica in nebraska's opening seconds you can tell this is something special.Springsteen's lyrics are so vivid you feel as if you know all these charecters or maybe thats why they're so vivid because we all do.From the title track based on fifties spree killer charles starkweather and caril fugate to the down and out auto worker on johnny ninety nine the content is pretty standard to most springsteen albums its the hopeless fealing he evokes with the bleak strings and stripped down recording that really puts the lump in your throat.If your not already a fan of bruce this is a great album to get a taste of just how fantastic a song writer he is.
B00009RDG9|1.0|Terrible.  Awful.  A travesty.  Any viewer should get a check from the filmmaker.  Arrgh.
B00003CXXP|5.0|I think the problem that most people have with Sci - Fi is that Hollywood has so bastardized it that the true genre is lost. We have been bombarded with action movies posing as Sci Fi, until most of us think that Sci Fi has to be ladened with humongous explosions and tons of special effects. Thus, when a motion picture comes along that is true to the genre in its purest sense, it is not fully appreciated by many. This is one of the few films to come along in years that is pure Science Fiction.     If takes a premise and explores it. What if we could make robots that seemed to love, and that seemed to have souls? What would happen? What moral issues would arise from this? \\"What if\\" is pure sci fi. The what if goes further and creates a scenario, not of good guys and bad guys, but of situations. The situations guide the characters and their actions. While not quite up to the standards of Asimov's \\"I Robot\\" (the book not the movie), this movie is a classic. I do not expect it to be recognized as such until years from now. We are in an age when accountants control what is on the screen and thus Sci Fi is reduced to silly action movies.     In this movie, a little boy is created to be a son. Of course he is adopted by a set of parents who's child is for all intent and puposes dead. He is being kept alive by being frozen in a deep sleep. The mother and robot child start to bond, but then the entire foundation of their relationship is shattered. The robot child is abandoned and left to fend for himself. He sets out on a quest to become a real boy - okay okay there are over tones of pinnoocio. What some reviewers called contrived, I found to be very moving. Alas all of this is merely my opinion.     Are the AI robots merely machines? Or have we created something different? Is their pain real or is it just bits and bytes? Is destroying them moral or is it murder? These are the type of questions good sci fi presents to the readers or viewers. Not \\"will this explosion be bigger than the next?\\"     If you like pure sci fi and not the Hollywood accountants assembly line non sense that is passing for it, you MAY like this film. All I can tell you is that I think it is a great sci fi story and I am grateful to finally see real sci fi return to the big screen.
0375759174|4.0|This book was a hard one for me to start. Not in the tradional sense of being a difficult begining. Truthfully I thouroughly enjoyed the book from the start. (The opening paragraph was brilliant in my opinion). No, I had done something very wrong. I watched the movie first. Not that this is always wrong,(altough should be avioded when possible), I have watched some movies that have left me looking foward to the inspiring lituarature such as PRIDE &amp; PREJUDICE or DAVID COPPERFIELD. But this movie punched me, left me reeling, never wanting to read a book that could produce a film like this.<br />  Flash foward a few years. My wife being an avid Austen reader was also hesitant about reading it. But she took the plunge and gave it a go. While it was not her favorite book, she enjoyed it enough to recomend it to me, saying it was almost completly different from the book.<br />  So with a little less trepidation I eventually decided I would read it. Amazing. I really liked this book. Why had I never wanted to read this book? How could they make a movie like that from this kind of material to work with? Why don't they get the people who did the PRIDE &amp; PREJUDICE mini-series to do this?<br />  My only problem with it was that it ended way to fast for me. Everything seemed to be resolved and finished in the last two or three pages, with very little of how thier lives turn out in the end. But if that is the only thing you can truly critize in a book, then I think your holding an excellent book.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|Okay now like half the women in America I am madly in love with Ewan Mcgregor.....and his voice motivated me to buy the cd....although I love the movie and all the songs in it most of my favorites were not included and if they were they were tweaked....I don't know i'm probably being picky but I wish they included them all.
B00003CXE7|5.0|When I first learned that Gladiator was coming out I was thrilled, not only because I have a love of all things classical, but also because of the action and adventure that was sure to be incorporated.  I was not disappointed.<br />This movie allows the viewer to peek into the world of Maximus, a general in the Roman army under Marcus Aurelius.  After Commodus, the emperor's son, betrays him, Maximus is thrown into a world of barbarity, cruelty, and slaughter where the only goal is to survive the next round.  He strives to reach the Coliseum and avenge the murder of his wife and son.  <br />One of the things that struck me most about his film is its heroic qualities.  Maximus tackles a challenge few men could have ever conquered. He also possesses the heroic qualities characters in other great movies possess: courage, strength, and honor.  At each junction, I cheered (in my head, of course) Maximus on and wished for his success.<br />The graphics are also stunning.  When Maximus enters the arena, I felt as if I too was facing certain doom.  The portrayal of Rome and the desperate situation of its citizens during this time is also quite realistic.  <br />This movie can only be considered one of epic proportions and I would encourage anyone who has not seen it to rush out and get it for yourself!
B00000J7SS|4.0|Joe Z., Wayne Shorter; this does foreshadow, Weather Report and it seems like undisciplined Weather Report at that. Roots exploration for my favorite band. Any fan of theirs wil find the sound strangely familiar; I might not like it as much as Sweetnighter or some Mahavishnu; but I'll place it at the top; knowing it is highly acclaimed, so-called ground breaking, and I can't argue with that.<br />The cover, certainly, refers to Africa, I would be remiss, not to mention, much of the music, has a primal beat to it, given it's rawness, makes it more potent.<br />A sixties snapshot, a family tree for Weather Report fans; an icon of jazz; but giving it one short of 5 stars on re-edit:
0316666343|4.0|This book was a gift from my husband - one I would not have chosen because it centres around the murder of a child, every parent's most feared nightmare. This was indeed a gift, a gift of softly lyrical beauty, taking us through the fear and horror of Susie's dying to the peace and reconciliation of a uniquely imaginative conception of the after-life. I loved the interplay of Susie's choice of her own heaven, her close observation of her family and friends' journey through their grief and the ultimate resolution of the search for the murderer and his final punishment. This is a unique story which is both moving and elegantly crafted. I await Alice Sebold's next novel with eager anticipation.

B00009V7RF|5.0|It's next to impossible to find an album in which every song is well liked... but with Elephunk I often hear and find myself saying... &quot;oh I love this song... oh this one too!&quot;  <BR>   People wonder why downloading has gotten so out of control but I think if artists were putting out albums and not just singles... that appealed to the masses through each song, people wouldn't have such a problem spending the exhuberant fee to buy it in its entirety.<BR>    Although &quot;Shut up&quot; is the hit single for the moment.. it's hardly the best song on the album.<BR>    If you're interested and not closed to variations of funk/rap/hiphop, check it out for even if you're not a huge B.E.P fan, you ought to be able to appreciate Elephunk for its versatile appeal.

B000002HB4|5.0|Rock'n'roll had its heyday in the fifties but the combination of simple music and high energy often resurfaces in an updated form. The Georgia Satellites exemplified everything that a great rock'n'roll band should be, even if their music was updated for the eighties.<br />The group only recorded three albums although various extra tracks were also recorded. The result was one big hit, Keep your hands to yourself, and two lesser hits, Battleship chains and Hippy hippy shake (a cover of a song made famous in the sixties by the Swinging blue jeans, a Liverpool group).<br />They wrote most of their own material but they recorded several covers. Apart from Hippy hippy shake, this collection also includes Don't pass me by (Ringo Starr), a live version of Let it rock (Chuck Berry) and Another Saturday night (John Fogerty) - this track also includes a brief piece of Rocking all over the world (another John Fogerty song) at the end.<br />If you are looking for high energy rock music, this is for you.
038572179X|5.0|'Atonement' is a carefully crafted brilliant novel and the best piece of literature I've read in 2003. I'm not going to tell here in detail about the plot and the content of the novel, but just want to tell and share something about how I feel about this book. Well, everything about this book is unforgettable! I was completely captivated by main character Briony's complicated personality and character, by the vividness of all the other characters, by McEwan's fluent prose and his breathtaking descriptions, by... must I go on?<br />I was deeply moved by the story, especially by Briony's role in it. I was fascinated by her personality and by the way she deals with life after her irreversible mistakes, made as a 13 year old girl, towards her sister Cecilia and Robbie Turner, the housekeeper's son. Mistakes committed on a hot, sultry summer's day on an English country estate, way back in 1935. Briony lies about events of a 'very personal nature' happening that day. Her statement -reflecting her wrong view and interpretation of what really has happened- changes and ruins the lives of Cecilia and Robby, and to a certain extent also her own life. The first part of the story, dealing with the events at the country estate in 1935 and covering the first half of the novel, certainly ranks among the best literature I've come across in my reading life so far.<br />In a very subtle way McEwan uses themes like guilt, remorse and atonement to tell us about human nature. What he explores and conveys I would never learn so convincingly from a science book with all its 'bare facts' about human nature. In 'Atonement' literature rules, as McEwan uses all his writing capabilities in optima forma. He makes us believe everything he wants us to believe about his story, about Briony's story, and yes, in the end -again- we learn from McEwan's superb writing, about ourselves.<br /><br />To me as a reader, the ingenious and very surprising plot of 'Atonement' is a captivating experience. It makes me realize (again) that 'literary imagination' is an intellectual playground of huge importance. Words from there can strike us like a bolt from the blue as soon as our eyes meet a novel's page. In 'Atonement' Ian McEwan demonstrates what a powerful instrument 'literary imagination' can be and better than ever before his writing shows the immense range of his intellectual playground.<br />In simple words I'd like to add that 'atonement' all in all is a very pleasant and most rewarding read that satisfies on all levels! Cheers!me realize (again) that 'literary imagination' is an intellectual playground of huge importance.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|Clearly this is the best cd ever made. All of the songs are good I'm telling you. Don't read all of the other reviews that give this cd 1 star. It's obvious that they haven't even listened to this cd. This cd is going to be a big hit and is a cd I will keep in my collection for a long time. I love Britney and I will always love her and her music. People say she has a bad voice. She doesn't. Her voice is pure, angelic and different than other divas's and that's a good thing because if she had a voice like other divas people would get bored of it because they have already heard that voice. Britney's music on this cd has club-anthems and ballads. She has really matured into one hot diva. I think she's going to be here for a long time. Buy this cd right now even if you have one already. Support Britney!!!!!
B000002UAC|5.0|The Beatles consolidated their reputation as a great rock'n'roll group with this album. Of course, very few people think of them that way now, but nobody knew then just how much their music would change as the sixties progressed. Like their UK debut, Please please me, this album contains a few covers and a selection of original songs, most of which have faded into comparative obscurity.<br />It won't be long, All I've got to do, Don't bother me, Little child, Hold me tight and Not a second time are all brilliant original songs, but how often do you hear these songs? Very rarely, except on this album. I've got a lot of Beatles tribute albums and I've heard a lot of other covers of Beatles songs and these songs are rare, to say the least.<br />There are two original songs that you are likely to have heard somewhere. All my loving was included in the Red album and has also been covered a few times. I wanna be your man was an early hit for the Rolling Stones - it was their second UK hit and just failed to make the UK top ten - an improvement on their previous record, which stalled outside the top twenty. Yes, the Beatles really did help the Stones on their way to superstardom.<br />The album includes three covers of Motown songs. At the time, Motown records did not chart in Britain - perhaps they weren't even given UK releases, so these and other covers helped to make Brits aware of their music. If it weren't for this Beatles album, a UK breakthrough by Motown might not have happened in 1964. Please Mr Postman was an American chart-topper for the Marvelettes, an outstanding Motown group. The song eventually reached number two in the UK charts via a cover by the Carpenters. I enjoy all three versions. The Marvelettes is the best, but not by much. You really got a hold on me was a huge American hit for Smokey Robinson and the Miracles. Money (sometimes titled Money that's what I want) was the very first American hit for Motown, way back in 1959. This song was eventually a top five UK hit for the Flying Lizards, a punk rock group. I can't stand their version but I've heard several other covers and I love them all.<br />Three other covers complete the album. Roll over Beethoven is one of Chuck Berry's classic songs. Devil in her heart is a gender-adjusted cover of Devil in his heart by the obscure girl group, the Donays. Till there was you is from the show The music man. It is not typical of this or any other Beatles album, being a ballad more typical of the thirties and forties (albeit updated for the sixties), but I love it.<br />This album, with some changes, became their American debut album. It was titled Meet the Beatles. Five songs were dropped and three others added. Several other Beatles albums were altered for the American market but all the CD releases are based on the UK versions.<br />On first listen, this album may appear ordinary compared to their later music, but don't be deceived. There's a lot of brilliant music here, especially for rock'n'roll fans.top five UK hit for the Flying Lizards, a punk rock group.

B00005JMGL|5.0|I loved this movie so much. I have already seen it twice in the theatre. I just fell in love with Jeremy Sumpter! I would die to meet him. Hes the same age as me, and hes really cute. The movie is really sweet, and made me cry a couple of times. It was also romantic. thanks. :)
B00006SFBD|5.0|Opeth is one of the greatest bands to come for a death metal backround. This is there second best cd, in my opinion, and does NOT fall short of being anything less then visionary. The song &quot;By the pain I see others&quot; is my favorite track, starting off hard and rythmically disecting the rest of the song.<br />     All in all, Opeth is the best death metal band, and is close to being the best in any gerne. If you love this album, you'll also love Black Water Park, which is their best album in my opinion.
B000000WFF|3.0|Probably riding on the success of their debut, The Spice Girls released their sophomore album a mere ten months after their debut. This may not seem to short but it is considering other artists who came out around the same time, such as Brandy and Monica with their sophomore albums, had several years away from the music scene between albums. This album is very similar to their debut. The girls co-wrote all ten of the songs on the album and it is saturated with dance hits even though ballads are really their strength. Lyrically, the album does not fair much better than the debut but the vocal talent is still undeniable. Also, the album was timed, though fairly rushed, in order to coincide with the movie of the same name. <br />The album, like their debut, kicks off with the lead single, &quot;Spice Up Your Life&quot;. Like the first track on the girls' debut, &quot;Spice Up You Life&quot; has extremely nonsensical lyrics but is unbelievably addictive and hard to get out of your head. The vocals are only average at best and the girls sound like they are shouting in a couple of places. The second track, &quot;Stop&quot;, was also a big hit for the girls even though it was not particularly good. Possibly the only reason this song was such a success was because it was so catchy. Otherwise, it had little to offer (mediocre vocals and lyrics). <br />Next came a debatable album highlight, the mid-tempo &quot;Too Much&quot;. The girls do a great job with the style of song and it's a shame that it is the only one of its kind on the album. The lyrics are a little bit confusing at times but they do make sense, unlike in some other songs. Granted, the lyrics are a little repetitive (especially in the chorus) but the vocals are good enough that it makes up for it. This song is followed by one of the weakest on the album, &quot;Saturday Night Divas&quot;. Like many of the Spice Girls' tracks, the beat is decent but the lyrics leave a lot to be desired. The chorus in this song is extremely irritating (&quot;get down, get deeper and down, get down get deeper and down, Saturday night.&quot;). It leads nowhere and is extremely repetitive.<br />Following this was another album highlight, entitled &quot;Never Give Up&quot;. It is a very fast track but it has a great message about, obviously, never giving up. The vocal quality in this song is decent. It is decent in the beginning, picks up toward the middle but goes a little downhill again towards the end. Unlike many of the girls' upbeat songs, this one actually works quite well. Unfortunately, it is trailed by another two weak tracks, called &quot;Move Over&quot; and &quot;Do It&quot;. &quot;Move Over&quot;, if you look at the lyrics, looks like one short song that was merely repeated to make it longer. Towards the end however, you have the girls simply stating words that rhyme with &quot;generation.&quot; &quot;Do It&quot; does not fare much better. The girls pull what is commonly known as the &quot;Mariah Carey style&quot;. That is to say, the sing some lines quietly then shout others. It works much better for Mariah.<br />Next, we come to the two best tracks on the album, &quot;Denying&quot; and &quot;Viva Forever&quot;. &quot;Denying&quot; is extremely well sung and the lyrics, though a little weak at first, improve quickly to make a beautiful song. The girls convey the message that by denying who you are, &quot;you ain't foolin' nobody but yourself&quot;. Finally, we come to the best track by far and my personal favourite, &quot;Viva Forever&quot;. This is the only track on the album that actually has quality lyrics as well as stellar vocals. The lyrics are simply enchanting and even the music in this track works well with the vocals. Lastly, we have another weak track, &quot;The Lady Is A Vamp&quot;. The album would have been much better off stopping after &quot;Viva Forever&quot;. The last track seems to be a tribute of some sort but the vocals are exceedingly irritating and the lyrics arevery difficult to follow.<br />Overall Mark: 2/5<br />Given that this is the girls' second album in only one year, you could expect it to go one of two ways. Either the girls could show off a whole different side to their personality or they could stick with the same formula as their debut. Unfortunately, they go with the latter because, well, why mess with something that worked? The girls are better off singing songs like Viva Forever, which is truly beautiful and showcases their talents. Regrettably, we only get a virtual copy of their debut with only four tracks that really stand out and only two of which are really amazing. I would borrow this before I bought it.
0385504209|4.0|What a Christmas for thrillers!  I received Michael West's awesome novel &quot;The Wide Game&quot; (which I read in a day!) and this incredible thriller (also read in one day)!<br />There's been a killing in the Louvre and the race is on to discover the truth behind an ancient secret, a secret hidden away since the time of Christ. West makes your heart race as you turn each page, but Brown takes it a step further to make your brain race as well. This is powerful work that will have you thinking long after you are done!  I can't recommend it more!
B000000WCA|3.0|When most people think of female pop groups, The Spice Girls are one of the first few to come to mind. The Spice girls debuted in February of 1997 and took the world by storm with their catchy singles and sweet ballads. The group consisted of five members, Victoria (a.k.a. Posh), Geri (a.k.a. Ginger), Mel B. (a.k.a. Scary), Mel C. (a.k.a. Sporty) and Emma (a.k.a. Baby). Their CDs mostly featured upbeat dance tracks with only a couple of ballads, which is too bad since the harmonies on their ballads were awesome. The girls released two albums that year before sort of fading away from the American music scene, though they all have solo albums in the U.K. By the end of 1997, there were very few people who hadn't heard of the Spice Girls and their debut was either a favourite of a guilty pleasure to a majority of people.    The album kicks off with the infectious single, \\"Wannabe\\", which was a typical dance track. That is to say, good beat, decent vocals but nonsensical lyrics. The song contains lyrics such as \\"I wanna really really really wanna zigga zig ha.\\" Not only is that line extremely repetitive, but it contains nonsense words as well as not even being anything remotely resembling a sentence. As well, Mel B. provides a \\"rap\\" (and I'm using that phrase loosely) verse that briefly describes what each girl is like (\\"Easy V [Victoria] doesn't come for free she's a real lady\\"). Thankfully, there are no more \\"rap\\" verses like this on the album. The album then slows down a little with the mid-tempo \\"Say You'll Be There\\" which shows a great improvement in lyrics and vocals and this is probably one of the best tracks.    The album slows down even more with a seductive ballad, \\"2 Become 1\\". Both the vocals and the lyrics are truly beautiful in this song. (\\"Candle light and soul forever, a dream of you and me forever\\"). The only slight problem with this otherwise amazing track is the repetitive nature of the chorus. The next song, \\"Love Thing\\", picks up the pace but it seems a little odd after such a slow, beautiful ballad. The song is not at all memorable and is nothing out of the ordinary. The next track, \\"Last Time Lover\\", slows down again into mid-tempo with subpar lyrics but decent vocals, making an overall average track. Next comes a slow, heartfelt ballad called \\"Mama\\", which, obviously, is about the girls' mothers. This is another song with beautiful lyrics as well as stunning vocals. It talks about how the girls never understood their mothers but now, as they get older, they start to see it from their mothers' points of view.    The last four tracks, \\"Who Do You Think You Are\\", \\"Something Kinda Funny\\", \\"Naked\\" and \\"If You Can't Dance\\" are all subpar dance tracks that have little function other than, well, to make the listener dance.  The first two tracks out of those four, \\"Who Do You Think You Are\\" and \\"Something Kinda Funny\\" are filled with meaningless lyrics and less-then-great vocals. Obviously, stellar vocals aren't the key point when a song has no purpose other than to make you dance but it is a nice bonus. The latter two of the aforementioned tracks, \\"Naked\\" and \\"If You Can't Dance\\", are no better. Naked is actually a mid-tempo song with beautiful lyrics but it does not stand out at all in the mix of dance tracks that surround it. \\"If You Can't Dance\\" is highly monotonous and offers nothing new.    Overall Mark: 2/5    Vocally, the girls are skilled but their debut album leaves a lot to be desired. Very few of the tracks have beautiful, moving lyrics despite the fact that the girls co-wrote every song. Even vocally this album leaves a lot to be desired. There is no question that the girls can sing but only two out of ten songs (\\"2 Become 1\\" and \\"Mama\\") showcase their vocal talent. For that matter, those are the only two songs that have stellar lyrics as well as vocals. On the other tracks, the lyrics are either nonsensical (\\"Wannabe\\"), or make sense but lead nowhere (\\"Who Do You Think You Are\\", \\"Something Kinda Funny\\"). The album was also extremely inconsistent as it switches tempos from track to track. This can work sometimes, but on this album, it seems awkward. This album was probably awesome at the time it was made but if you are considering getting it first, borrow before you buy.
B0000C0FJB|3.0|After reading the reviews here, I decided to have a listen for myself. The music part of this cd is monstrous. Excellent sound. These guys hit their mark every time. But what happened to the vocals? It does not really matter. We all know the words anyway. However, I wish they paid more attention to the vocals during the mixing process. the liner notes do give a hint why this cd sounds the way it does. &quot;Recorded by old brazilian mobile recording truck.&quot;
B0000AQVCL|4.0|I really love this album.  The songs are great, the performances crackle with energy.  There's not a bad song on it.  I'd give it five stars but the sound quality is distorted in some parts.  It's not the fault of the band or the record producer -- the manufacturer amped it up to high.  There's a brief article in the latest edition of Wired Magazine reporting that this is a  common practice in current cd manufacturing to make the discs louder.  The wavs are compressed and much of the actual sound is lost in order to make the cd play &quot;louder.&quot;  The songs actually sound better on MTV.  But this gripe isn't specific to this album, it's on virtually every &quot;current&quot; music cd.  Older discs and high end remasters (e.g. The Who's &quot;Tommy - Deluxe Edition&quot;) don't have these problems.  Discounting the grouse against the record industry for intentionally distorting the sound, &quot;Get Born&quot; is an excellent album and I hope to hear lots more music from JET in the future.
4789004546|5.0|This is a dictionary I can safely say lives up to the promises it has on the back cover. <br />I have studied Japanese for 3 and 1/2 years and what frustrated me the most was the often vague and sometimes typo-ridden grammar lessons within standard college-level Japanese language textbooks, and they weren't helping my weak grammatical skills. I read about this book via the glowing reviews on-line and I agree with them. Concise, convenient, yet it still gives you all the vital information you need to know about the various grammatical phrases in Japanese that throws many people off.<br />I've learned some new helpful phrases with this book and reinforced ones I've previously learned. This book really makes me feel more confident about speaking in Japanese and allows me to write and read more fluently. I plan to buy the Intermediate book soon. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to become a serious Japanese speaker.
B00005JKN9|4.0|Like it was already mentioned in some of the reviews the first 2/3 of the movie is great. Very powerful, stylish, logical. It's Scorsese in his best. The rest of the movie seems to be created by different authors. It is totally out of the rhythm of the movie. It does make an impression that the movie was cut and all the cuts happened in the end. The end of the movie leaves you very disappointed. So why four stars? The main reason is the first 2/3 of the movie plus the acting by Daniel Day-Lewis, which is incredible. Both Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz were adequate (I was pleasantly suprised by Diaz, which is quite organic in this movie). This and very interesting subject.
B00008N6N5|5.0|Telling the story of Larry Flynt, the unsympathetic character behind Hustler magazine, was always going to be a hard job.  However, Foreman's movie manages to pull it off thanks to great jobs from all round.  It starts with a brief clip of Flynt's early life as a boy, peddling booze to redneck farmers and throwing a jug at his father, who's drunk all his wares.  Fastforward to his strip joints where he meets feisty, unpredictable but undeniably sexy Althea (Love).  Before long they've set up Hustler magazine and not long after that they find themselves in a series of court cases concerning the decency of Flynt's publication.  The story really switches gears though when Flynt is gunned down by a sniper's bullet, leading to his Althea's drug addiction and Flynt's increasing eccentricity.<br />The fact that not only is the direction good, but the acting and script are also brilliant.  Woody Harrellson gives the best performance of his career as Flynt, evoking sympathy in a character that's bravely rarely played for the sympathy vote.  Courtney Love was born to play the role of grungy white trash glamourous drug addict Althea and pulls it off so convincing that it's surprising that she was nominated for an Oscar as well as a Golden Globe.  Edward Norton turns in another great performance in the supporting role of Flynt's lawyer and anyone who's seen his performances in American History X or Primal Fear won't need to hear any more convincing about his abilities as an actor.<br />The best part of the story is the pathetic nature that it draws out in its protagonists.  Love in particular enters her character so much that when she wraps her arms around her husband after just using his drugs it's close to heartbreaking.  Whilst the argument for Flynt as a liberator of free speech may seem a bit over the top (despite some very funny scenes in the courtroom), the film gently suggests the intense melancholy behind the larger than life character.  The last scene especially evokes this superbly, with Larry watching videos of his wife telling him that he'll grow old and ugly as she's playfully dancing naked for him.  As the camera shows us Larry's face we know that he realises this to be true as he's sat alone in his luxurious bedroom despite his greatest victory against the Supreme Court.
078681859X|4.0|It's the story of this djinni, Bartimaeus, who gets summoned by a magician's apprentice, Nathaniel. On the search for revenge they get caught in a plot to destroy the magician government.<br /> When people describe this book, they always seem to start with Nathaniel. For me, it's ALL about the ironic, clever, slightly malicious djinni. Bartimaeus is written with such skill that i feel he could (i hate this cliche) jump right off the page. (i wish he would, i think he's great!) <br />I don't think Nathaniel is quite as vivid but he still makes an alarmingly strong character. I love the way he's not \\"good\\" in the sweet polite little boy sense of the word, and that in the end of the book you are left wondering if he'll be manipulated into turning \\"evil\\". <br />I think that Simon Lovelace lacks something. He makes a good baddy, just not a great one. And i like my villans proper nasty (i think Faquarl pulls this off wonderfully).<br />Some people have compared this to Harry Potter and although i didnt notice the simularities while reading it, i do now. The young magician (or wizard) both in their type of school. Magicians treating commoners (or muggles) as second class citizens. The big wizard trying to take over the world and only this boy can stop him. It all sounds a bit familiar. However, i don't think Bartimaeus comes in anywhere in Harry Potter, and he's what makes the book. So Jonathan Stroud gets my full apprecation. I couldn't honestly say whether i prefer Harry Potter or The Amulet but so far there are 5 Harry Potter books and only one Amulet of Samarkand. <br />All i can say is read it! In fact buy it! If you're anything like me, you'll love it!!!
B00005JKN9|5.0|Gangs of New York is an epic crime story about the son of Priest Vallon, Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio), who looses his father in a street brawl.  Amsterdam returns to his neighborhood, the Five Points, in the year 1863 during the peak of the Civil War when masses from Europe are immigrating into the US.  Amsterdam is seeking revenge on the killer of his father, William &quot;The Butcher&quot; Cutting, however, he is approaching cautiously.  Despite Amsterdam's lack of interest in political issues, he is drawn into them anyway through his fathers murderer who is highly engaged in such issues.  Gangs of New York offers a brilliant cinematic experience through the supreme mise-en-scene, the exceptional cast who performs very well together, and the complex story telling that will engage the mind.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|My actual rating is 4 1/2 stars and there is one particular reason why this album doesn't quite reach the highest level. And that one mistake is a weakness that has sunk many a CD (most of much lesser quality).<br />-YOU CANNOT ALLOW THE ABSOLUTE BEST TRACK TO BE THE FIRST SONG ON THE ALBUM!!!!!!<br />And there is no doubt that &quot;The Package&quot; is in a class by itself as a world class example of epic, alterna-metal songwriting and musicianship at its best. It is as stunning and mesmerizing an opening song as you will find on any rock CD released in the last few years. Choosing to begin their album with such a masterpiece is the one mistake that Maynard &amp; Co. make on this otherwise exhilarating album. <br />TS is a very eclectic and musically varied album. For those who are looking for a surrogate band until the next Tool release, &quot;The Outsider&quot; and &quot;Pet&quot; will easily blow out your speakers if played loud enough. Fans who seek the more prog. rock focused part of Mr. Keenan's rock'n'roll persona will revel in the Yes/ELP/Pink Floyd-like majesty of &quot;The Noose&quot; and &quot;Gravity&quot;. And, of course, &quot;The Package&quot; will be remembered as a symphonically unique compostion on par with such other recent classics as Silverchair's &quot;Emotion Sickness&quot;, The Black Crowes' &quot;Cursed Diamond&quot; and Marilyn Manson's &quot;Coma White&quot;. Some pretty heady company.<br />APC has shown a remarkable level of growth since their debut release and Maynard will be hard pressed to resist the temptation to abandon Tool and concentrate his efforts on  this &quot;side project&quot;. After all, in Tool, he is only one quarter of that remarkable bunch of equally talented musicians/songwriters (each of his bandmates has to be ranked as one of the best in his area of expertise). As frontman for APC, although he is also surrounded by less well-known virtuosos, Keenan is quite obviously the focus and driving force. <br />As a fan ofboth (Tool is head &amp; shoulders above any hard rock group currently active), I hope he has the stamina and musical longevity to produce more works of art that live up to THIRTEENTH STEP. In the meantime, I will continue to listen to this amazingly well-orchestrated and always interesting album. In a weak year for rock CDs, TS will be long remembered as one of the most accomplished sophomore efforts in a very long time. It ranks with releases by Alice In Chains, Soundgarden and other such icons as one of the best second albums ever.
B000096IBI|5.0|Modern Times is the last silent film that Charles Chaplin created in a time when talking was common on the silver screen.  Once more Chaplin takes roll as the Tramp where he is exploited as cheap labor that can be used whenever needed, since the Tramp's options are rather limited due to his monetary needs.  However, even an honest hard worker such as the Tramp can suffer from burn-out and go astray as he is sent to a mental institution.  Cured and recovered he departs from the institution, but ends up in the wrong place at the wring time and is sent to jail.  Modern Times displays the socio-economic needs and vulnerability of the poor who fall outside the system.  At the same time, the film displays gentle love and care that provides a base for hope and dreams for those who are struggling for a happier and better life.  Overall, Modern Times presents an excellent cinematic opportunity that gives both laughs and tears, which will leave some pondering the structure of the society.
0517543052|5.0|It was midnight and I was on top a butte in the Glass Mountains of Oklahoma. I was with another kind soul and poured my anguished heart out regarding my feelings of betrayal - war residue. He said I should read \\"Be Here Now\\". I did and 35 years later my gratitude is still high, it is such a magnificent book. It spoke beautify of Karma and Grace, of an amazing voyage of self discover and despair. It points the kindest finger you're likely to come across to the notion you aren't alone or in bondage. I've since been a Yogi, a body worker, an Astrologer and Therapist and haven't out grown \\"Be Here Now\\". Read it and set your own course. Just remember, whatever is happening you're there and millions of the billions share your experience. Who are you?
B000066NW0|5.0|Aaron, in case you haven't noticed, they're other reviews that say that Avril has a stupid image. There's over a hundred of them, if you read closely...
0553573403|5.0|Wow, I just finished this book and my head is still swimming.  Simply put, this book is simply amazing in every regard.  The characters well developed and are not totally &quot;good&quot; or totally &quot;bad.&quot;  More than once I found myself cursing a character... only to cheer them on later in the story.  As a matter of fact, more than once I openly cursed the book.<br />I havent felt like this about a book since I read the 1st book of the Wheel of Time.  Martin has mastered with Jordan has started.  I do not look forward to jumping back into &quot;Randland&quot; after I've been treated to this feast of literary perfection by Mr Martin.<br />Brilliant.  Utterly refreshing.  Totally deserving of 5 stars - I highly recommend it.
B00005JXY3|5.0|Making this happy if sappy sequel to THE KARATE KID quite appealing are the timeless, immutable qualities carried, generation to generation, to and through every human heart:  Love; Forgiveness; Mercy; Compassion; Remorse and other good, great from age to age, emotions.  Daniel's Antagonist does as effective a job of rousing the deep, powerful and positive feelings from within him - and us - as does that of Mr. Miyagi's.  If plot devices such as the bamboo rattles and farcical final confrontation with a Bully able to have already killed Daniel, DEAD, look trite, remember they exist to give us a brief glimpse into a refined, advanced culture flourishing millennia before ours.  Keep in mind that condemning KARATE KID part 2 for so-called &quot;silly&quot; elements within is, in fact, far from as disgusting and tasteless as any of the TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE &quot;movies&quot;.  My bottom line being, KARATE KID part 2 is Super Stuff ! Rent (or buy) it today !
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I find it interesting that that this person bashes a reviewer, but can't find anything to say about the album, going as far as to point out his spelling mistake, when you appear to have completely missed a word.  Quote &quot;this is a sad review that exemplifies the excuses many Dream Theater fans are making for an album littered atrocious song writing. Further, it is &quot;where similarity&quot;, not &quot;were similarity&quot;. You may want to read over the review first if we are supposed to take your immature view seriously.&quot;  Shouldn't there be a &quot;with&quot; after the word &quot;littered&quot;? So it's an &quot;immature view&quot; if there's a typo, but you can write this nonsense and eloquently state your case? What happened to reading your review first?  Well done, friend.  Well done... Good to see don't even have the stones to state your name.
B00006IU73|5.0|Progressive rock is a terribly difficult thing to find in newer forms these days.  Bands such as Yes, Rush, King Crimson are still producing great music, but the sun is setting on these musicians.  One of the last remaining rays that are coming up on the horizon is Porcupine Tree.  In Abstenia is a solid album with no weak tracks to speak of.  It opens powerfully with Blackest Eyes and ends beautifully and solemnly with Collapse the Light on Earth (an ode that could be compared to Walking on Air or One Time of King Crimson).  <br />Porcupine Tree has many elements within their music.  Of which, they have the power of Rush, the sometimes electic sound of King Crimson, the waftiness of Pink Floyd, and the harmony of Yes.  Combined together, they create music that is brilliant, thoughtful, and etched in stone.  The other thing is that, while this album is prog rock, it is just mainstream enough, so you can even cross over from a more general like of rock music over to their realm.  So whether you are into prog rock or if you like classic rock, this group is a group not to overlook.  Get the album and you'll probably head right out the door to get the others.
0784011710|5.0|Probably everyone has seen this movie, and probably everyone knows the premise, and probably everyone knows what Sophie's choice was and why it's slowly driving her crazy. But just in case there's a viewing population who is still clueless about this movie (based on the best-selling novel by William Styron), I'm not going to say too much so as not to give it away - because I was stunned with the enormity of it when I saw the movie for the first time and don't want to ruin that potential element of horrible surprise for new viewers.<BR>Setting: Brooklyn, just after WWII.<BR>Characters: Stingo (a young idealistic writer), Sophie (a Polish war survivor of the Holocaust), and Nathan (Sophie's lover, played in his movie debut by Kevin Klein)<BR>Plot line: Something horrible happened to Sophie during her time in a Nazi concentration camp, and details are slowly revealed through a series of harrowing flashbacks.<BR>Advice: See this movie. It's one of the best ever.
B000089RVR|4.0|If you think that &lt;No Angel&gt; is a great album, you gonna love this one. The lyrics are amazing, especially White Flag, which actually reflects a situation in my life, maybe that's why i love it, and the rest of the album is just relaxing and soft, maybe if you like a different kind of music you shouldn't buy this one...
B00004RF9B|4.0|Forbidden Planet is probably the best representative of science fiction's golden age at the movies.  The 1950's and 60's saw a generation of writers produce a series of excellent, though-provoking films that were all the better because they were grounded in hard science and ideas. Movie like Planet of the Apes, Forbidden Planet and Day the Earth Stood Still. Today's deriviative unimaginative sci-fi garbage films don't hold a candle to them for all their cgi glory.<br />The Forbidden Planet deals with an Earth ship investigating a previous landing on a nearby planet.  Only one man and his teenage daughter survive and the fate of the other crew -- and the nature of the planet itself -- is shrouded in mystery.<br />The plot is basically The Tempest in space.  And those with a keen eye will see how this movie heavily influence the original Star Trek.  But this is still a treat.  Anne Farris and (talk about surprises) Leslie Nielson give good performances.  The special effects stand up remarkably well after so long.<br />But again, what sets this movie apart are the ideas.  See the detail when the crew take their ship apart to build an insterstellar communicator.  Or how the crew carefully and systematically deals with the dangers they are presented with.<br />I can't recommend this film to everyone, since too many people will get caught up in the movie's age and that many of its original ideas have been copied so much as to now be cliche'.  But if you like serious sci-fi, you will love this movie.  Here's a quick litmus test.  If you liked the recent flashy-but-pointless Planet of the Apes, you will not like this movie.  But if you liked the original though-provoking Planet of the Apes, don't hesitate to add this to your colllection.
B000089RVX|4.0|First i have to say that i'm a pop music lover, Britney, Christina, Etc. but this album is amazing considering that i don't like rock music, i was inspired to buy it when i fist heared BRING ME TO LIFE, then GOING UNDER and now MY INMORTAL which is an amazing song!!! I think if you're a pop music lover, you gonna love this album, even when is not really pop!
B00005JMFR|5.0|If you are a casual Matrix fan, someone who liked the first two movies for their gunplay, kung fu, and special effects, but didn't quite follow the subtleties of the intricate storyline, you will not like this film.  Most of the story takes place in the Real World, where everything is dirty, clothes are raggedy and food tastes terrible.  No, this film is for the serious Matrix fan.<br />The star of these films, believe it or not, is the story.  The special effects, cast, and action sequences are window dressing.  Kudos to the Wachowski Brothers for staying true to their vision and not capitulating to pressure to give it a Hollywood ending.  Matrix Revolutions may not be the critical or financial megahit expected, but it will take its place among the better movie trilogies ever made.  <br />Right now, aside from \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and Indiana Jones trilogy, there is none better, including the original Star Wars trilogy and the anemic 2nd trilogy due for completion next year.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is an amazing album, the first four songs are gonna make you dance from the beggining, considering the participation of Madonna & the Ying Yang Twins. Showdown has a very special rythm, and Toxic (the new single starting January 15, 2004) is a great song. I think that if you enjoyed the previous britney's albums, you gonna love this one even more!!!
B00006JJ1O|1.0|The only reason for their fame is because they're lesbians and there are people out there that would throw away 12 bucks just to listen to lesbians sing about nonsense. I don't have a problem with lesbians at all, I'm just saying that's the only reason why people would listen to tatu. So what if they're lesbians? Does that mean they're talented? In this corrupt world where money is God, people will buy anything. I agree with other reviewers that this group is nothing more than a project created by some fat, middle aged guy who just wants to fatten his wallet. I remember seeing a commercial about tatu on TV. Corrupting our youth? Heck yeah, because that's what the middle aged guy wants. He wants to fool everybody into thinking this is real music so he can get more money. It's not working on me, however. I'm not buying this CD. I actually buy good music. Just a word to the wise, don't buy this CD. They're not that hot and the lyrics are stupid.
0385504209|3.0|Dan Brown has the elements of what could be the news story of the common era.  There's the possibility that the founding of Christendom was shrouded with the same deceit and treachery that accompanies those other Jesus- come- lately religions.  And to think that there's a living group of seers who may have the power to rock the spiritual universe should they choose...  What a theme!  Most people interested in religious history have probably learned bits and pieces about Gnosticism.  This novel takes some of those suppositions as Gospel and stretches the consequences to the present day.<br />  Here's the problem.  Such a grandiose theme demands concomitant language.  But Dan Brown's prose has all the polish of a daily blog.  Too much energy is devoted to word riddles and pursuit.  The inner lives of the main characters are so little explored one doesn't much care what happens to them.  At the end, I was just sorry that P. D. James didn't write this mystery.<br />  This subject deserves the attention of a competent historian or perhaps requires the sleuthing of an investigatory journalist.  I hope The Da Vinci Code inspires someone to do better.
B00008J2DQ|1.0|I'm going to make this short. My dad likes them and he let me listen to some of it, but I don't really see why he likes them so much. I don't think they're that good.
B00009TB5G|5.0|That's sad... the hardest part about writing this review was coming up with a title...<br />The Two Towers was a good film to begin with... but the extra 43 minutes was definitely worth sitting through!  I normally don't even like this type of movie, but now that I've seen all three, the LOTR trilogy ranks among my favorite films of all time.  Peter Jackson did a lot right with these films, even if they do deviate slightly from Tolkien's books.  First of all, he surrounded himself with capable actors/actresses.  No performer puts in a bad acting performance, and the people chosen to play the particular characters fit the roles very well.  Second, the music is phenomenal.  Music is one of the most important non-visual atmospheric impact parts in any movie, and Jackson realized that in the making of this film.  The music is melancholic most of the way, and where in most films you'd expect a bold, triumphant orchestra piece, here you've got a sorrowful violin solo.  Great effect.<br />The filmmaking and script writing was great, and I think everyone who's tired of the meaningless pop-culture junk the motion picture industry is turning out these days should watch this.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|Well let's just say some singers know harmony and Keys is one of them.  This CD is a good, I give it a B+, Songs in A Minor was an A, simple because all the songs on A Minor were geat.  On this CD there are maybe 2 songs that should of been left off and two interludes that should of been made into full songs, just my opinion.  Alicia sings with so much soul and harmony, while listening, before you know it the CD has ended and you are like wow.  <br />Stand Out songs: <BR>Harlem's Nocturne<BR>Karma <br />Heartburn <BR>If I Was Your Woman / Walk On By<BR>You Don't Know My Name<BR>If I Ain't Got You <BR>Diary<BR>When You Really Love Someone <BR>Feeling U, Feeling Me - (interlude) <BR>Slow Down <BR>Samsonite Man <BR>Nobody Not Really - (interlude)<br />Kind of disappointed the &quot; Streets Of New York &quot; was not includes as a bonus track...<br />Please stay away from the likes of Mr. P. Diddy, when it comes to production.  <br />Overall I'd say cop the CD, you can't go wrong with her passionate style of singing.
0792839730|5.0|A Bridge Too Far is a long movie, so unless you're truly a WWII film enthusiast, I wouldn't recommend it.  However, if you're looking for some insight into one of the lesser-known operations of that bloody conflict, then this movie is great.  <br />Operation Market Garden was an ambitious plan by the brilliant but often arrogant strategist Field Marshal Sir Bernard Law Montgomery, and unfortunately, it cost the lives of many brave soldiers.  Although Monty considered the operation a success, it failed to achieve one of its main objectives (the siege of the bridge at Arnhem in Holland), and the casualty rate was unacceptably high.  Many of those killed were members of the British 1st Airborne, who were literally fighting tanks with rifles.  Col. Frost (played in this film by Anthony Hopkins) and his men fought bravely, but there was no way in Hell that lightly-armed paratroops were going to defeat an SS Panzer division.  It also illustrates the slaughter of Polish troops (the Polish general is played by Gene Hackman), who were delayed in landing because of fog, picked off by enemy troops as they parachuted down, and then ambushed by the Germans in a nighttime river assault trying to come to the aid of General Urquhart (Sean Connery), forcing the General to withdraw.<br />The film is laden with big-name actors, and while it doesn't feature any jazzy modern-day special effects, it focuses on the main issue: the sacrifice of the men who fought in this overly ambitious campaign.  The film profiles the mistakes made leading up to the campaign, such as the lack of planning, overlooking of certain obstacles (example:  a photo-reconnaissance mission over Holland revealed German tanks, but the Allied high command was so eager to push the campaign forward that they simply ignored them), and the fact that the operation was rushed.  The acting is great, but with the cast list that this film has, you wouldn't expect anything less.  The film is split up such that no one actor getsthe bulk of the attention.  It's a great film for history buffs, and reveals the brutal and haunting truth about an operation that Allied forces would like to forget.

B00004T9UF|5.0|First of all, I'd like to say how extremely underrated I think Em has become recently.  Almost everyone I hear talk about him, I always hear them throw in the line, &quot;Eminem s*cks!&quot;  Well, I almost feel like coming right out and saying just what he did, &quot;Well, you cak suck his d*ck if you don't like his sh*t!&quot;  Eminem definately is one of the greatest rappers of all time, and that's not an opinion, that's a fact.  So, who cares of he's white?  That should make people even more impressed.  Anyway, THE MARSHALL MATHERS LP is one of his best albums ever, and there's only maybe 3 out of 20 tracks I don't like, eliminating skits, which I don't really like either, except for &quot;Stan.&quot;  So, buy the CD, it's well worth your time and money.  And be prepared to enter the twisted world of Slim Shady!
B00000IQW3|4.0|In 1984, Lorimar Film Entertainment and Universal Pictures joined forces to create a very engaging and entertaining sci-fi film entitled &quot;The Last Starfighter&quot;.  Directed by Nick Castle, the story begins in the dreary and dusty &quot;Starlite Starbrite&quot; trailer park where the teenager Alex Rogan (Lance Guest) lives with his mother Jane Rogan (Barbara Bosson) and his inquisitive little brother Louis Rogan (Chris Hebert).  Alex has very little free time for himself as he has become the de facto trailer park maintenance man, repairing various problems in neighbors' trailers.  He would like to go to college and leave the trailer park behind, but his mother's meager wages make that impossible.  His girlfriend Maggie Gordon (Catherine Mary Stewart) also lives in the trailer park.  When not with Maggie, Alex's favorite enjoys playing a videogame called Starfighter located next to the trailer park's office.  Alex becomes very skilled at beating the videogame to the delight of trailer park residents.  One night, a mysterious, fast-talking man named Centauri (Robert Preston, 1918-1987) pulls up in a fancy car.  After asking about who beat the videogame, he invites Alex to join him in his car for a meeting.  To Alex's dismay, Centauri drives them away from the trailer park and then into outer space, where he takes Alex to the planet Rylos so that he can become a real starfighter to fight the evil Xur (Norman Snow) and the Kodan armada.<br />With inspiration from the first three &quot;Star Wars&quot; films (which were released in 1977, 1980 &amp; 1983), the highly successful 1982 videogame-based film &quot;Tron&quot; and the overall popularity of videogames in the 1980's, &quot;The Last Starfighter&quot; is a fun film to watch and was one of the earliest films to use computer-generated graphics to depict outer space scenes.  As always, Robert Preston did a magnificent job of acting in what unfortunately was his last big-screen appearance.  Lance Guest's portrayalof Alex was probably not as good as Mark Hamill's portrayal of Luke Skywalker in the 1977 &quot;Star Wars&quot;, but it was good enough to keep the film's momentum going.  Catherine Mary Stewart did do a good job with her portrayal of Maggie.  Other memorable characters in the film include Alex's lizardy copilot Grig (Dan O'Herlihy), trailer park manager Otis (Vernon Washington, 1927-1988), trailer park resident Elvira (Peggy Pope), Maggie's grandmother (Meg Wyllie, 1917-2002, who played the Talosian Keeper in the original 1965 &quot;Star Trek&quot; TV series pilot &quot;The Cage&quot; that was later refashioned as the two-part episode &quot;The Minagerie&quot;), Lord Kril (Dan Mason) and Enduran (Kay E. Kuter, 1925-2003).  Memorable scenes include Alex at the trailer park, Alex beating the videogame, Centauri's arrival and trip into space, Alex's arrival on Rylos, meeting the other starfighter pilots, the surprise attack, Alex talking with his beta unit, the Kodan spy, Alex's time with Grig, the battle scenes and the final scenes.  Overall, I rate &quot;The Last Starfighter&quot; with 4 out of 5 stars.
B000001FMX|5.0|I discovered the New York Dolls in a rather strange way.  I work at a store in the mall that played cheesy Halloween songs during the Halloween season.  I never really paid any mind to any of them, but one in particular stood out, and that was the song Frankenstein by the New York Dolls.  I loved David Johansen's lyrics and the way he excuted his vocals, especially at the end of the song.  I didn't know too much about the Dolls, other than the fact that Johnny Thunders did lead guitar for them, but this song really helped spark an interest.  I ended up checking them out right here on amazon.com, and I'm very glad that I did so.  This is a wonderful album from a wonderful band.  At some points, these guys were extremely ahead of their time.  I really like the feel of the production.  I guess the actual production quality is somewhere in the middle, but it suites the music, along with the monstrous vocals of Mr. Johansen perfectly.  This is really more of a rock release, but it still caters some of the earliest of punk elements.  Not only does this album offer some great originality in music, it also bears one of the greatest album covers in music history!  I'm only 19 years old, so I guess I hold this release on much higher pedestal because I may have gone through life without even knowing of it's existance.  To sum this all up, I'm very glad I was lucky enough to discover the Dolls and encourage anyone interested in them to give this album a chance.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is an amazing DVD! The picturization is awesome and the characters are perfectly cast! The usage of language is impeccable. It been a delight to watch this movie. I have watched it 3 times in the last 1 month and hope to watch it many times in the future!<BR>Mr. Darcy rocks!!
B0000B1OFL|5.0|Awesome movie that gathered my attention from begining to end. This movie was so intense I couldn't leave the room to use the bathroom. I was very pleased that Edward Norton was in this movie. I would definently recommend this movie to a person who enjoys Drama/Action!!
B0000AXE8I|3.0|I enjoyed The Matrix--I saw it three times in the theaters.  Granted, it took all three times for me to finally catch on and understand, but it intrigued me.  The Matrix Reloaded just didn't have the same impact.  I didn't feel sorry for anyone, I didn't want to jump in and help anyone, and I sure didn't want a Matrix-ified close-up of anything meant to be clothed (take that as you will).  I felt that much of this movie was a waste of perfectly good screen time.  It acted as a lame filler between the excellent first movie and satisfactory third movie.<br />My verdict: see this movie only to catch up on what's going on in and out of the Matrix or ask a friend, but don't waste your shelf space for it.
B0000AMRJC|1.0|I started to watch this movie &amp; thought it might be going somewhere. I was very wrong, NO PLOT WHATSOEVER. Pacino's on drugs the whole movie then kills his best friend then, dies in the end. END OF STORY!!What do people see in this movie........ NOT VERY IMPRESSED&gt; YUCK!!
B000002H97|5.0|After this release by Metallica, it is really no wonder that their fans have never been sattisfied with their work. That is simply because of the sheer greatness that the Black Album posesses, and it is truly deserving of the Title of Greatest Album ever. Many of the songs on this album are known by most people, mainly the primary track 'Enter Sandman'. One might say that this track is overplayed on television an on radio, but this song is truly a great, the video only serves to compliment this song and i really would hav no problem with MTV playing it over and over again. Sad but true is a track which is very heavy and very different to Enter Sandman, which Lars Ulrich has claimed to be a pop song. It has some great guitar work and James Hetfield's voice gives an added harshness to the track. 'The Unforgiven' is a true Metallica classic. 'I dub thee Unforgiven' is what James Hetfield sings. This is a track which is virtually unplayed by Metallica and is rarely used in live shows. The song is very mellow and chilled, with the occasional hint of harshness. But it is a true 10/10 track, as is the Unforgiven ii which appears onm 'reload'. 'Wherever I may Roam' is the fifth track and in this day and age where artists like Eminem and 5O Cent give rhyming a bad name with the vulgar and slang lyrics it is very easy to appreciate the rhymes in this song no slang no crap just rhymes that mean something and when placed together they actually mean something. It gives an insight into life on the road as a singer and how one has to adapt to it. Of Wolf and of Man is quite a harsh track that anybody could rock out to and feel qite exilerated, an essential track for anybody who buys this album. Then the love ballad 'Nothing Else Matters' is a true example of Metallica's greatness, as it shows Metallica's ability to sing softly as well as harshly and it can also be used as a great break up track ! The version on S&amp;M is very good also. But every track on this album falls into the catagory of heavy or soft, the music videos are well worth keeping an eye out for, particularly 'The Unforgiven' which depicts an elderly gentleman trying to make his way out of a room but dies before he can (quite morbid, but very effective) and each members abilitys are highlighted at different points in the album. So if you every ask the question why do the Load and Reload albums get so much stick all the time look no further than the predecessor of these album and you will understand as the Black Album is truly the GREATEST ALBUM IN THE WORLD. METALLICA FOREVER
B00005JM0B|4.0|I was very impressed with all the action in this movie. The graphic were very nice as well. There was some intensity during the begining &amp; little near the end. Overall there was not to much plot. I recommend this movie only if you want a hard core action flik. NOT A KIDS MOVIE!!
0385504209|4.0|Murder Mystery or Heretical Revelation?<br /><br />This book is a great page turner because it can be understood on at least three levels:<br />1. Murder Mystery<br />In the great tradition of Agatha Christie (suspense and erudition) and written in the style of Tom Clancy (i.e., jumping from one uncompleted scene to another as they rush toward each other), The Da Vinci Code makes great reading. Interesting, sympathetic characters are caught in a convoluted web that they fight to unravel, with the reader's full involvement.<br />2. Scholasticism<br />The iconography, particularly of Da Vinci of course, but to one extent or another all of Christendom, Judaism and their Pagan antecedents is touched on in an intriguing and interestingly informative way. Plus, who knew that &quot;sub rosa&quot; came from a kind of Roman mistletoe for secret meetings; or that &quot;gargoyle&quot; is derived from the word to &quot;gargle&quot;? A lot of study went into this work, and it is presented in a very readable way.<br />3. Historical Fact<br />Here, each must come to their own conclusions. The basic story is that in the year 32 AD, a pregnant woman (Mary Magdalene) walked from Roman Palestine to modern-day France, where she was sheltered by a colony of Jews who accepted her child as the descendant of the Messiah. Oh! And maybe Walt Disney was in on the secret later on, along with less amazing personages as the Knights Templar. And, of course, Leonardo Da Vinci. The mind reels.<br />Everybody loves a cabal. Cabals are fun. The Holy Grail is fun. Hermann Hesse is fun. Umberto Eco is fun. The Da Vinci Code is fun (and erudite), but let's just leave it at that ... except that, after all our page turning, we don't actually find the Grail! So there must be a sequel, no?<br />It will probably be worth reading, too. Have fun.
B00005JMCN|5.0|Ok, I am totally stunned by how great this movie turned out. I watched it once in theatre &amp; was very impressed. I have recently purchased the DVD &amp; have watched it nearly 10 times. My favorite line in this movie is &quot;It's better to break a man's leg than is heart&quot; This is such a great feal good movie for when you are feeling a little down.I live in Kentucky so, it was nice to see them shoot part of the movie here. I am not really a horse fan at all. If you watch this movie you will truly not regret it. IF I COULD GIVE THIS MOVIE TEN STARS I WOULD!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
0385504209|5.0|This novel is a captivating read which I had trouble putting down. In fact my husband also started to read it at the same time,and we were quite competetive over who got the book at any given time!<br /> The suspensful story begins with the mysterious murder of the curator of the Lourve with well defined strong characters of the investigating police, the niece of the slain  curator, and an American expert in symbols who is  unknowingly  drawn into the mess as he had the last known appointment scheduled with the victim.  What follows is the quest to discover the murderer in a story filled with fascinating details based on historical research  of the Holy Grail, and a secret society of the Catholic Church called Opus Dei, and discussions of various aspects of church history, all of which  enrich the mystery.<br />Dan Brown ingeniously weaves facts into his fictional tale, and is so convincing that some readers will undoubtedly take from this book some of his invented ideas with conviction they are historically true.<br />As a NY Times Bestseller, this book has received much attention in all media which only adds to the fun of reading it. There are magazine articles, and book club dicussions on the radio and television shows which have dissected the story and identified  fact and fiction based  on this remarkably entertaining and thought provoking read.<br />This is a book which I think will be judged as a significant work of pop culture.I look forward to the movie I anticipate will be forthcoming, so please read this BEFORE then-as books are OFTEN better than their counterpart movies!
B00003CWL6|1.0|I purchased this movie in hope that I would be receiving a 5 star movie. This movie was a great idea if you cut out Lester's fantasy of his daughter's best friend &amp; his wife screwing around. This movie is obviously not intended for children to even be in the room. It was insulting to see Spacey so hung over a girl that he could have had as his daughter. I enjoyed Spacey's comedy that he added to the movie but, other than that you may just want to pass this one up. It is very over rated in my book. Don't let me be the judge though. Sorry to the people who love this movie but, I DO NOT recommend.
B000063COX|5.0|This is a very good album not only is it considered a classic but it has many of Iron Maidens best hits such as &quot;Sanctuary&quot; , &quot;Prowler&quot; , etc.  The album has a very 70s feel to it the way all the songs are portrayed and sung.  Very good album... If you just getting into Iron Maiden this is the album to buy first!

1558908846|4.0|The more I see this film after all the hype has died down, the more it grows on me. This is probably the best thing that Stallone ever did in my opinion. If you ever read the British comic book series you realize that he nailed the essence of the main character. I mean, Judge Dredd is a completely one-dimensional character, and Stallone still managed to bring him to life.<br />The entire movie, and the original comic book series, was based on the fact that the Judges were incorruptible. These are not just good lawmen; these are walking law books- THEY ARE THE LAW. They have to be, for they are not merely law enforcement officers, they are also judge, jury, and executioner. Only someone raised from birth to live the letter, essence, and spirit of the law could be trusted with this. Certainly, a mere human could not be trusted with such power. That is the fascination of a character like Dredd- he isn't human. Here is a man so completely identified with duty that there is no room for personal feelings. This is essential, for a Judge must be completely impartial and unswayed by personal opinion and feeling. A Judge judges the rich and powerful, and the poor and weak, by absolutely the same standard. That is why you can never write Dredd and the other Judges off as fascists- it is equal judgment for all in the name of the public good, of public survival, in an apocalyptic Cursed Earth. And God save the Judge that breaks his oath....<br />Max Von Sydow was also especially good as Dredd's mentor. I mean, if they could get an actor of his quality interested in this project then you know that he also saw something more to it. Playing off Stallone you actually see the one bit of humanity in the character. The scene where Sydow takes the last walk to bring judgment to the unjudged still chokes me up.<br />Sure, there is plenty of action and special effects here- good ones. They also managed stay fairly close to the details and characters of the original stories. But, I've slowly come to see that there really is more to it. Not bad for a project that originated from a comic book.ly come to see that there really is more to it. Not bad for a project that originated from a comic book.
0452282152|4.0|Taken one element at a time, this book has little to recommend it. The plot is very thin. The characters are for the most part either uninteresting or unpleasant. There is no action and little dialog.<br />Yet, somehow these elements combine to make a surprisingly good -- even great -- book.<br />Part of the credit goes to the writing and part to the innovative and imaginative concept. I can just picture the author looking at Vermeer's painting and wondering, who was she? We've all done that. Yet, Tracy Chevalier went a step further and created a possible reality that rings true while never pretending to be anything but imaginings. An incredible accomplishment. I don't think I'll ever be able to look at a Vermeer painting without thinking of this book.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|I still remember that when I first came up with a list of what films I would like to actually own as a boy (before video tape) this one was at the top of the list. Now that digital technology is here, this two DVD set is literally the ultimate. The color is so sumptuous that it makes my teeth hurt. The included cartoons, shorts, and newsreel make you feel like you are back in 1938. Then, you have everything you ever wanted to know about the making of the film in the historical commentary (who knew that the horse that Olivia de Havilland rode in on would become Roy Roger's Trigger?) If this isn't the definitive presentation of this film, then I cannot imagine what will be.<br />Maybe the true test of a great film, or a great legend, is whether or not it means as much to you as an adult as it did as a kid. Would you go out of your way to introduce your children to it? As the credits say, this is based upon the ancient Robin Hood legends. That is why it holds up. Robin is the champion of the people. He holds England for it's true King in the face of murderous, thieving usurpers. I still get a chill when he tells his men to scour the country and bring King Richard back safe to Sherwood. In fact, there are a lot of scenes here that still give me chills. I wanted to be one of the Merry Men as a boy- and I still hope that I'd have what it takes to defend the land and the people from a pack of rich, powerful, lying thieves:<br />Robin Hood: Men, if you're willing to fight for our people, I want you!<br />Sir Robin of Locksley: I'll organize revolt, exact a death for a death, and I'll never rest until every Saxon in this shire can stand up free men and strike a blow for Richard and England.<br />Prince John: Are you finished?<br />Sir Robin of Locksley: I'm only just beginning. From this night forward I'll use every means in my power to fight you!<br />Lady Marian Fitzswalter: Why, you speak treason!<br />Sir Robin of Locksley: Fluently.<br />Sir Guy of Gisbourne: You've come to Nottingham once too often!<br />Sir Robin of Locksley: When this is over, my friend, there'll be no need for me to come again.<br />Sir Robin of Locksley: It's injustice I hate, not the Normans.ottingham once too often!<BR>Sir Robin of Locksley: When this is over, my friend, there'll be no need for me to come again.<br />Sir Robin of Locksley: It's injustice I hate, not the Normans.
B0000041Q3|5.0|I'm not saying that Turner sings Turandot better, she's just my favourite, that's all. (Even though only her &quot;In questa reggia&quot; and some snipets were recorded, the critics describe her precisely) As for Nilsson: Sadly I was never so fortunate to hear her live but ever since I bought my first recording starring her (Turandot with her, Corelli and Vishnevskaya) I've loved her laser-like sound. A personal favourite of mine is a late Tosca starring her and, as she called him, her &quot;Baby-Cavaradossi&quot; José Carreras. (My favourite tenor) Also, I've never said that Callas was better than Nilsson, they are completely different voice-types Nilsson being a dramatic soprano and Callas being a soprano sfogato.<br />Quite honestly you should be ashamed of your attitude, judging people you don't know like this. I have no reason to fake fondness for anyone. At least I don't spread lies about other singers and call everyone who disagrees with me tone-deaf, sycophant or worse. Aren't you realising that you're behaving like a baby? I have a guess that I know you from some Yahoo-Group, but I'm not sure. I might be mistaken.<br />As for von Karajan: I'm not a great fan of his Turandot but to dismiss one of the greatest conductors ever like this just shows how arrogant and ignorant you truly are. I too have my dislikes but I'm not playing God, dictating which recordings should be &quot;banned&quot; etc. Quite honestly? I'm sick of your lies, of your hatred for Callas (Who was a sweet person btw, that you're following cheap prejudices only confirms your ignorance! Ever heard of Caballe? She says that Callas was a sweet person!) and of your arrogance. Have courage for once and admit your name at least, you COWARD! <br />I have no intention of plaguing the Review-Space of this recording anymore so here is my email-addy: elisabetta611@yahoo.de<br />Now let the hatemail flow or are you too much of a WIMP to show your true colours?<br />To all Amazon-Customers: Please accept my apology for abusing the Reviews-Section like this but I won't have my good name slandered by an immature brat, I'm truly sorry!
0156012197|5.0|Something confuses me about \\"The Little Prince\\".  Here we have a small simple tale that takes about half an hour to read.  It is quiet and philosophical.  The plot, such as it is, follows a the Little Prince and his petite adventures.  The Little Prince loves a rose very much, but he must travel about the planets to better understand this love.  The book is so lyrical in its simplicity that it's no wonder that it's often given to graduating students each and every year.  More so than \\"Winnie-the-Pooh\\" or \\"Oh the Places You'll Go\\", this book encapsulates the world with pinpoint precision.<br />My confusion?  Why has this book been repeatedly ruined for kids?  Am I the only one who remembers that catastrophe that was, \\"The Little Prince\\", an anima television show that played on Nickelodeon in the 1980s?  How about the movie, starring Bob Fosse as the snake and Gene Wilder as the fox?  How does a book this perfect become so exploited?  I can only liken it to other books of its caliber.  Like \\"Alice In Wonderland\\", the absurd plot elements make the story poignant.  And like \\"Alice\\" (or the aforementioned Pooh) the book's simple writing is easily \\"improved\\" by the adults of the world.<br />I don't think \\"The Little Prince\\" is ideal children's literature, mind you.  Kids may humor their parents by listening to it, but when you sit right down and read the book, it is not gripping stuff.  The patronizing tone taken about \\"grown-ups\\", the Peter Pan-like elements, etc. all combine to make this a book that is ideally for children without actually saying anything to them directly.  This is a book for adults but ostensibly for kids.  Few children are going to be fooled by this.  They'd rather sink their fangs into something a little more along the lines of \\"Harry Potter\\" or Lemony Snicket.  But it is a piece of children's literature that will last beyond all our lives.  This is a classic for the 20th century, and \\"The Little Prince\\" fully deserves to take his place amongst the other classic kid characters encompassed in the cannon.  It is an outstanding tale of simply loving small.other classic kid characters encompassed in the cannon.  It is an outstanding tale of simply loving small.

The Surprise for me was when Hugh Grant held up a book about Turkey (Istanbul, the Imperial City by John Freely) for Julia to look at....I illustrated a section of that book!!! I almost fell off my chair!!! It's available from Amazon!!!

The picture quality is very crisp compared to the VHS tape Ive watched a million times...However directors cut or no I would strong recommend that you save your money boys and girls as I am sure that this will be Re-released in 5.1 as a &quot; super special&quot; platinum edition..yada yada yada version. Now keep in mind I have nothing but respect for the Floyd but Ive been waiting a Long time since I first heard that Pompeii was coming out and after the teasers of 5.1 classic Floyd on the Wall DVD I was really dissappointed to see the Plain and dull dolby stereo on the case, which was covered by the price sticker so I didnt know until I got it home. At least Pulse is coming soon :)
B00005YUNY|4.0|I truly don't understand die hard Yes fans. There's always a debate on which band members they'd prefer, over the ones offered. No doubt they're an aging band, and all performances they give should be relished, as if it may be gone tomorrow.<BR>This DVD rocks. Contained are some of the best live tunes I can recall in recent memory. Steve Howe is magical with his guitar, and his guitar sound change on stage is amazing, in keeping with the original recorded sound as it came of the album. \\"Roundabout\\" was re-tooled for this performance, and also energized by the women of the orchestra dancing on the stage with the aged members. Hey look, they're having fun! <BR>I've never given \\"Ritual\\" more than a glance off \\"Tales\\". Again, here it is, energized, and played beautifuly. <BR>Chris Squire is his old self. A God if you will, of his bass guitar, and sounds best on the \\"5.1 surround\\" offered. Alan White is also keeping all his players together, including the orchestra behind him. Probably his most difficult attempt at drumming, and follows through like the pro he is.<BR>John Anderson is his cosmic self, rambling here and there, but that's how I remember seeing him live, and I doubt he'll change. One thing that's also not changed much, is his voice. He can still belt out the tunes, octivly speaking.<BR>The only fault with the performance is the orchestra itself. At times I couldn't even the horns playing. I would have to fault a bad miking or mixing problem. I'll bet the actual live performance would pale the disc representation. Here I believe it was captured for a taste of what might have been had I been there, and I enjoyed all the tracks. I'm sure you will too.<BR>The picture quality is amazing, even for DVD. This is what the format was made for. <BR>If you really want to be video wowed, pick up their DVD called \\"House of Yes\\". You'll be able to see the bands every wrinkle in their performance. <BR>This \\"Symphonic\\" is the disc to own, a slightly better performance over \\"House of Yes\\", great picure quality, sound,  and it will leave you wanting this standard on all your DVD's.

B0000041TD|5.0|This is a classic Boheme. But let me tell you an &quot;open&quot; secret. There are even better Boheme's out there.<br />Yes, Pavarotti can hit all those high notes. But somehow, he can't match Domingo's intelligence of portrayal. And Freni simply cannot match Caballe's exquisite piannisimi. Caballe is, well, Caballe. You can't replace Caballe with Freni. It just doesn't work. Freni works well in theatre because she is beautiful. But when it comes to the voice, CABALLE is the ultimate Mimi.<br />And Karajan's conducting is simply too &quot;beautiful&quot;. Where is the drama??? This is typical smooth and lots of legato Karajan without much else in it. Yes, it is beautiful but devoid of &quot;verismo&quot;. <br />I guess this forum must be flooded with Pavarotti fans. Fact is I owned this set for a long time slightly dissatisfied. I was told that this is the best. But it goes to show how influential critics can be. Whatever they say, the public just swallow - lock, stock and barrel. <br />If you want to hear a REAL Boheme, get the Solti. After waiting a long time, I decided to explore the Solti set, and now I finally understand what Boheme is all about.
B00005JMGL|5.0|This live-action version of Peter Pan stars Jason Isaacs as Captain Hook and Jeremy Sumpter as Peter.  The story begins in London, where motherless Peter has come to listen to stories told by young Wendy (Rachel Hurd-Wood).  He takes her and her brothers to Neverland to live the wild pirate life, until it is time for them to return home and grow up.<br /><br />All the characters you remember from your childhood are here:  The ticking crocodile (computer-animated and scary), the fiesty Indian Princess, funny Pirate Smee, spunky Tinkerbelle, and even Nana, the dog-nanny.  The film is photographed almost entirely in dark, moody lighting to heighten the feeling of magic and danger. Jason Isaacs hams it up just right as the dashing and outrageous Captain Hook and he is good as the timid clerk, Mr. Darling.  Jeremy Sumpter looks just like Peter should look - beautiful, cocky, and fun-loving.<br /><br />Definitely darker and more sinister than the old Disney version, this film has a lot to offer adults:  It is visually stunning and reminds us about the innocence and fun of childhood. It's an interesting movie that will put a smile on your face and perhaps a few wistful tears in your eye.
B00005JMTN|5.0|Sorry about the cheesy clich&eacute;d title, but I saw this movie after work tonight, and I absolutely loved it. There'll be enough people giving away the story without me adding to it. I'll just say that I was so impressed by the fact that the special effects were great, for my taste. They weren't the kind of knock-your-socks-off full-tilt guns and explosions they seem to just throw in for the hell of it, and that wouldn't have been appropriate, anyway. There is great subtlety and beauty in this movie, and the director kept this movie relatively clean. I am very grateful for this. Of course, for me, this is all gravy, due to the fact that there is actually meat to this movie in the form of a well-written, if complex, story that's beautifully resolved at the end. I love sentimentality, because I'm not afraid to cry, so this kind of movie is right up my alley.<br />What is it about members of the former British empire and their ability to do American Southern accents so well? This is nothing new, of course; I remember  Dame Elizabeth Taylor in Faulkner's \\"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\\". Speaking as a mere Oklahoman, today's crop of British actors do equally as well! It's hard to believe that actors McGregor and Finney weren't both from 'Bama! I think an Oscar needs to go to their voice coach, because he/she did an excellent job! And I must say that Ewan McGregor redeems himself where I'm concerned by not butchering any more of Elton John's music or even singing at all. What he does is great comedic acting, and he was a joy to watch, as was Albert Finney, whom, frankly, I thought was dead! The rest of the supporting cast was, well, eclectic, to say the least and fun to watch.<br />Finally, let me say that they feature the most beautiful red Charger I've ever seen. I hadn't seen one in years, and this movie made me almost want one again.<br />I can see myself buying this film when it's out on DVD or video and just watching it over and over again. I can't say that about a lot of films that's out these days, either. I'm even interested in the book from which this movie springs from, because it stands to reason that there was more to this story that couldn't be shown onscreen while maintaining the PG13 rating!

B000089RVX|5.0|I've tracked through this disc a bunch of times now - It just keeps getting better with each listen. It didn't take long to realize \\"Fallen\\" was going to make its way into my rotation of discs I listen to a lot. I found myself anxiously waiting to hear what came next while listening to it, which rarely happens.<br />Their music is hauntingly dark, and beautiful at the same time, and it does have its \\"rock\\" moments, thanks to some really nice guitar sounds. And I *love* Amy's voice! The production is huge sounding; the songs are beautifully textured with keyboards, strings and layered back up vocals.<br />This is not a 'rap-metal' band, if you've only heard the \\"Bring Me To Life\\" single. There's a lot of depth to this group that you might not be expecting to hear ... and a lot of interesting things going on. Definitely not a \\"throw on at a party\\" CD - But one that I find myself wanting to explore beginning to end, again and again.<br />Besides the lead single, I really like \\"Tourniquet\\", \\"Going Under\\", \\"Haunted\\", \\"My Immortal\\", \\"Whisper\\" and \\"My Last Breath.\\" The rest of the songs are also very good ... totally worth picking up, and hopefully an indication of more brilliance to come. Awesome stuff - a CD that's worth your attention.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|Not even Bill Murray could save this one. Since watching LIT I've been trying to find a redeeming quality. I have two. First, the acting. Both Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansson were good, especially when you consider what they were given to work with. Second, the movie eventually ended, and that may be its strongest point. <br />Lost In Translation is the sort of movie that makes you work to watch it. Every scene is so underwhelmingly insignificant it leaves you thinking, 'That scene was pointless...but maybe that was supposed to be the point...so then why I am watching it?' And by then it's halfway through the next scene and well...you get the point. Three out of five scenes could have been removed from LIT and you'd have the same film. <br />Bob (Bill Murray) is a once famous American actor who is still popular in Japan. He's there doing ads for a whiskey company, and he meets Charlotte (Scarlet Johansson) who's staying in the same hotel with her husband (Giovanni Ribisi), a busy and vacant photographer with whom she has so little chemistry you're left wondering how they ever managed to meet, let alone get married. <br />After about 45 minutes of the cinematic equivalent of Volkswagen commercials, Bob and Charlotte sense their mutual misery and become buddies. At first it's low key, but when Charlotte's husband packs up to leave town for a few days, whoa-ho! Buckle your seat-belts because...well, no. Still nothing really happens. Bob and Charlotte take little day trips all over Japan and I think it's safe to assume that something's happening, but we can't be sure because Coppola never shows us. In her attempt to reach the apex of dramatic understatement we are repeatedly shown what appears to be a) the beginning of a scene, b) the middle of a scene, or c) the end of a scene. As a result we never really know where the relationship is. The characters are thus weakened and so is the power of the relationship- but wait; I thought this was supposed to be a character/relationship driven movie? Uh-oh.<br />Then, in what is the penultimate dramatic scene of the film, Bob and Charlotte are lying in a bed late at night and he reveals the staggering, revolutionary news that life and marriage can be hard, and then he touches her foot. <br />Here's bottom line: Coppola tried to tell us a story by method of understatement - by showing us exclusively the details of the story - but she showed us all the wrong details. For example, take the scene I mentioned above. How does Coppola end it? Fade out. There they are, on a bed late at night, just having had an intense discussion, Bob made some physical contact...black screen. <br />HOW did that actual, 'real life' scene end? *That's* what defines character and relationships. Did they sleep together or just next to each other? Did Bob carry her up to her room? Did they wake up and have an awkward moment? It's *those* details that Coppola left out and instead chose to show Bob and Charlotte showing up at a bar they didn't realize was a strip bar - and then leaving. Bob slowly teeing up a golf ball, and then hitting it. Charlotte stubbing her toe. Bob having a bizarre encounter with a Japanese masseuse. In other words, absolute nothingness wrapped up in a costume of Coppola's artistic license. This is why we have to work so hard to understand this relationship - because we're always trying to figure out what's happened since the last scene. I'm sure lovers of this film would criticize me for not being 'patient with it,' or 'needing to have everything spelled out.' Untrue. Carefully add up all the excruciating details and busywork in LIT and it still amounts to very little.<br />So what then is our reward? A peek into the twisted morality of Sophia Coppola. Everything in LIT points to Bob and Charlotte's relationship being a beautiful, misunderstood thing. But let's really look at it. A young couple, married only a year or two - the woman is struggling with her identity as her husband's career takes off. (This is called 'life.' Welcome.) And an actor, always traveling, having problems with his wife of 25 years. (Maybe because he's always away while she's alone trying to raise a family.) So the actor and the confused young woman meet and internally assume that if only they were together in a different world, all their problems would blow away with the wind.<br />Apparently in Coppola's mind this is a natural, sweet, beautiful occurrence. There is nothing sweet and beautiful about this film - even if it had been done well, which it wasn't, it was still a story about emotional infidelity in two marriages.<br />And then there's Japan. Look, I've never been there nor have I ever been particularly interested in the nation, but I was insulted for the Japanese after seeing LIT. Coppola chose to exclusively show the outlandish 'weird-game-show' side of Japan. Lesson learned courtesy of Coppola? The Japanese are short, strange people who talk funny, and a week in hell would be better than a day in that bizarre God-forsaken country. Just about every cliched piece of Japanese 'humor' was crammed into LIT, and not once was it funny watching Bill Murray trying to understand Japanese, especially not after seeing it 8 times in 90 minutes. Yes, I understand that she's trying to use it as symbolism for two people trapped in a strange land who only understand each other...yawn. Very 'Screenwriting 101'-ish.<br />This is a poorly told story that ineffectively tries to convey a very poor message. And I went to this movie *wanting* to like it. Just go rent Stripes and The Godfather; you'll be much more satisfied seeing LIT's star (Murray) at his best and seeing LIT's reason for existing (Francis Ford Coppola) than seeing LIT itself.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I listened to an interview on yahoo.launch, about how Damien Rice came to be as popular as he is today. He first got a record deal, but he felt like it wasn't the right time because he didn't have the creative rights over his cd. So he took time off went to Tuscany, got restless, then came back to Europe and played on the streets like a bum. Later on down the road he produced a record on his own, called &quot;O&quot;. Damien has a unique way about him, where he says it how it is. It sounds to me like his perspective on like is exactly how where it should be at this point in his life.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Before I listened to this record I read the jacket, and it made me nervous. I noticed that the album was produced, engineered and mixed by one person, Pierre Marchand. He also played guitar, bass, piano, keyboards and did some programming. This is usually a recipe for disaster, a control freak producer enforcing his implicitly narrow viewpoint over the entirety of the record. Rarely are they skilled enough to pull of all these tasks on the highest level.<br />Marchand, however, is a very talented man it seems. Instead of cramping the album, his omnipresence seems to focus it in. He generally succeeds in creating an ambient, floating mood on each track. Overall, it gives the record a warm, familiar feel.<br />Unfortunately, this isn't enough to make a great record. It also takes songs, and surprisingly, this is where the album falls short. To quote Timothy Hutton in \\"Beautiful Girls,\\" every song is a \\"good, solid...seven and a half.\\" I'm noticing this trend in albums from great artists like McLachlan - albums filled with consistently average songs and no standouts (David Gray, Nelly Furtado and Dido come to mind). The album, as a whole, is pleasant to listen to but it's also a linear experience. Nothing stands out as great or awful. This is fine for sleeping music, but not for hit records.<BR>  <BR>It's hard not to recommend \\"Afterglow,\\" and as you see I gave it four stars because it succeeds in many ways (great production, and an album full of 7.5 songs is still better than most), but it fails in providing those one or two smash songs that are worth the price of the album alone. That should keep it from the stratosphere of sales, unfortunately.
B000002HEM|5.0|In my opinion - which of course may not agree with yours although it might- this is the best, and I mean the best light rock album with a female vocalist. If I were to pick the 5 best american female rock composers, Natalie would be among the three best with Tori and who else?... hmmmm thats a difficult one. But anyway, you know what I mean, her music is great, very melodic, inspires lots of different moods and adaptable for a wide variety of tastes. I wonder what is of Ten Thousand Maniacs nowadays now that they are without the marvelous Natalie.
B00005JLWN|1.0|In any good action movie, it is ok to create an alternative reality. However it is, at least somewhat, important that the movie tries to exist within the reality they choose to create.<BR>When the movie goes way off track already within the first three minutes, and the rest of the movie really doesn't unveil any new aspects to the action genre, nor does it even give any twist to the established action genre, I get really bored. The movie is filled with faults in the logic of its own plot, acting really sucks and the movie fail to present any ideas of its own.<BR>If at least the action scenes where any good, or at least somewhat entertaining, I would be willing to forgive some of the massive faults in this movie. But no, effects and fight scenes are uninteresting and boring.<BR>There are really not many reasons to see this film, and I would say this is 103 minutes of my life I never will get back.

B00005JMTN|5.0|Tim Burton has really struck gold with his latest fim, \\"Big Fish\\".  In recent years, Tim Burton has had his share of bad movies (\\"Planet of the Apes\\"), but over the span of his career, has released some of my favorite movies (\\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\").  Overall, I'm thinking that this is at least in the top three.  You see, this is the same imagination that made \\"Edward Sissorhands\\", but Tim has done something he's never done before.  He made a film dramatic and epic, but still in the vain of his earlier works.  Everything about \\"Big Fish\\" is breathtaking.
B000002UKS|2.0|Bought this thinking it would have the quiet, melodic version of Everlong.  It doesn't.  I also thought I might like the rest of the CD.  I didn't.  Nirvana wanna be's but nowhere near as good, and all the rifts sound the same.  I did like a couple of the slower, quieter songs.  But as a whole, a waste of $13.49.
B0000028UK|5.0|I try to be a fan of the newer Pearl Jam, but just can't do it. They've lost their way musically and writing-wise, and Eddie Vedder is just a bit too serious for his own good. But this CD is simply awesome, and one of those &quot;10 CDs I would take to a desert island.&quot; It is diverse in both writing and music, very emotional, and best of all, very honest and real. While Daughter is a good track, I can't help thinking it is a re-hash of Jeremy from Ten. Beyond that, however, I think the rest of the tracks are very original, thought provoking, and just good hard rock &amp; roll.
0198534469|5.0|What a great book this is!<br />This is a book that any math afficionado must have, and will undoubtedly savor. I frankly don't understand those reviewers who have given this book fewer than five stars. In fact, five stars wouldn't seem to be enough here. This book is among the best math books one will ever find!  What else would one want from a such book?  It is exciting, friendly, creative, often funny, crystal clear, fresh, deep, and unfailingly courteous to the reader--a quality not always found in math texts.<br />Additionally, this book succeeds on another level -- it is just plain beautiful. Math, to be great, must be beautiful, while books about great math too often are not. This book is truly beautiful, even artful. The author has taken great care to create beauty here.<br />I intially bought this book, because as an ex-mathematician whose analysis skills were getting rusty I wanted to revisit complex analysis. This book certainly succeeded in brushing up those old skills, but it also deepened them. The book has marvelous insights and geometric drawings that demonstrate in a clever way the links between complex analysis and other branches of math and physics. How could one not love the lovely and intricate drawings that depict, say, loxodromic transformations on a sphere, or the eye-popping diagrams of rotations in hyperbolic space? They're fabulous! Even the problem sets are delightful. <br />As a side note, some of the historical glosses about mathematicians are also very lively, and are another source of pleasure here.<br />On the dust jacket is the blurb--&quot;If you must buy only one math book this year, this is the one to buy.&quot;  I have to agree. I bought a couple dozen math books last year, and this one outshines the rest. I can't recommend it highly enough, even if you already feel comfortable with complex analysis. <br />I encourage my fellow readers to pick this up, and see how beautiful a math book can be.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Its about time that these tunes were made available without all of the goofy Phil Spector strings and wistful choruses. These tracks are much closer to the sound heard in the movie LET IT BE. Well worth the wait.
B000008LH5|5.0|Save up a few extra coins and get the Import version or the re-mastered version of this release.  The omission of \\"Hobbit\\" for the first USA release was a big mistake.  Not only are you missing Ric Lee's bombastic drum solo, but also Alvin's smokin' tone to kick off the drum solo from \\"Big Red\\", his 1958 Gibson ES-335 wired through enough Marshall stacks to blow the house down. The omission is like Led Zepplin II without \\"Moby Dick\\" on it!<br />For those interested in such trivia, Big Red was acquired by Alvin in the early 60's for around 45 pounds, case included!  Being an amateur boffin(guitar tech), Alvin removed the pickup covers and installed a single coil pickup in-between the bridge and neck humbuckers \\"to give it more top end\\".  Suffice it to say that the tones and controlled feedback that emanate from this heavy duty axe border on magical.<br />The many decals that decorate Big Red were passed along to Alvin at Woodstock and other venues and \\"just got slapped on\\".  The guitar was re-laquered after being repaired(the neck got broken), and the decals became permanent fixtures, \\"which is fine\\" as Alvin put it.<br />A good view of one of Alvin's ES-335's(not Big Red though...it has a Bigsby!)is on the back cover of the A SPACE IN TIME album, laying atop a pinball machine with the strings in disarray.<br />For those lucky enough to witness TYA live, we have the memories of a so-tight band in full swing.  Leo Lyons has to be the most energetic bass player on the planet.  He bobs, he weaves, he seemed to be in perpetual motion for the whole show!  Chick Churchill's excellent keyboard work layed down the rhythmic foundation along with Leo and Ric for Alvin's jacked solo's and smooth riffing.<br />This \\"official TYA bootleg\\" was culled from performances during nights in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Paris and Frankfurt, and the sound quality of the live recording is just fantastic(I noticed that some other reviewers had actually critiqued the varying sound quality of the different released versions, so you may want to read up a bit before making your decision).<br />The song selection ran from cuts off of the very first TYA album, up through ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC TO THE WORLD.  Sadly, no cuts were offered from the most excellent CRICKLEWOOD GREEN album.  I agree with another reviewer that the version of \\"I'm Going Home\\", although fantastic, pales in comparison to the benchmark, which was of course from Woodstock.<br />For the sake of proper running order, it is \\"Extension on One Chord\\" that is sandwiched between the intro and outro of \\"I Can't Keep From Cryin' Sometimes\\".  The blistering guitar pyrotechnics during this extended jam are just awesome.  Alvin slides, scrapes, chicken picks and plays with reckless abandon on this jam.  Note Alvin's tuning down of the low E string during one part to play some tasty bass, including a rocking send up of the \\"Peter Gunn\\" theme.  At one point, a brief cover of the main riff from Cream's \\"Sunshine Of Your Love\\" gets a big applause from the audience.  The intro to this medly, where Alvin does fast scat vocals along with his guitar picking is a joy, and the way he slides into \\"Cryin'\\" from this is a master stroke.<br />All in all, a jolly good show, and IMHO one of the best live albums of the era, along with the Who's \\"Live at Leeds\\", Allman Bros. \\"Live at the Fillmore East\\", Humble Pie's \\"Rockin' the Fillmore\\" and The Stones \\"Get Your Ya Ya's Out\\".
B00012QM8G|5.0|I consider Schindler's List to be the best film ever.  It is an inspired work that I found to be touched by the hand of God.  Despite the backdrop of the Holocaust, I was exhilerated rather than depressed by the experience.  It is a triumphant story of good over evil.<br />One reviewer lamented that this is not the type of film one would want to view more than once, so why buy the DVD?  However, when this film was released, I watched it every weekend while it was in my local theater.  Watching it again became the thing that I most wanted to do each weekend.  I am thrilled that it is available on DVD.  I hope one day that Spielberg will realize the importance for him to record commentaries for his films.  This film certainly deserves one, but I am not holding my breath.
B00007G207|5.0|This film should have competed for the best picture, not just the best foreign/international film.  The storyline is real with the characters well developed and the acting superb. This movie is quite moving and touches one on a level that is uncommon for any type of media, not just film. If you're in the mood for a cleansing, healthy cry and are not averse to reading subtitles, buy this romantic classic and keep it handy for when special friends come to visit.  It will be placed in your &quot;surprise sleeper&quot; movie pile that you can access on special ocassions.
B000059H98|5.0|how do I do this justice?  Only in my Fellini days did I watch films more than once.  I've watched this one 5 times and I'm still laughing, still relishing the humor.  It unfolds easily... but it keeps unfolding each time I watch it and hasn't grown stale.  I just watched it again and it drove me here to urge you - this is the best stuff!  No cliche goes unexploited.  social mockery?  don't even start.  ... just a comic book really.<br />sure.  Try it.  Totally fun.
B00005JMTN|5.0|A fantastic story about storytelling.  Burton remembered what a movie is meant to be.  Burton's over the top innocence at it's finest. Just a joy to watch this touching, and personal story.  Tears, and laughs in equal parts.  A onion for the ages, in my opinion a perfect recipe.
B000099T2L|4.0|Now-a-days R&B records are homogenous. They address the same themes, contain the same musical instruments/beats and are produced by the same old celebrity music producers. So essentially you would predict Beyonce's first solo effort to be the same as her fellow R&B starlets.<br />But surprisingly Beyonce does something completely individual, she delivers what she promises: a classical'n'contemporary R&B record. Combining her illustrious talents learnt from working on Destiny's Child, with the talents of celebrity and fresh new producers, they create a state-of-the-art R'n'B record, that sounds one part futuristic, one part modern and one part '60s soul.<br />Ranging musically from reggae 'Baby Boy', to rock/funk 'Hip-Hop Star' (noticeably influenced by Outkast's Big Boi) to the slick computerized R&B of 'Be With You'.<br />Her vocals are also splendid here, and range from a sexy provocative tone on 'Speechless' to a teenage yelling blissfully on the album's intro: 'Crazy In Love'.<br />Beyonce also covers a variety of themes on this record. From an emotional ode to her 'Daddy', to female empowerment on 'Me, myself & I' and 'Yes', to ineffable love with the title track.<br />Album highlights include: the very very very sexy and special 'Speechless', the intelligent and cute Missy Elliott-created ode to the zodiac 'Signs'. The romantic and cute -lovey dovey mixed with gangsta thugs- track \\"That's How I Like It\\", \\"Yes\\", and the very emotional 'Dangerously In Love 2'.<br />Though this album reveals how much Ms Knowles has come from 'No, no, no', she still has a long way ahead of her if she wants to reach her full potential. Also though this album is innovative, different and special, some tracks do fall near mediocre. So Beyonce next time you should concentrate on perfecting 20 songs instead of 45!<br />***At this years Grammys, Beyonce took home 5 Grammys -Best Contemp. R&B Album, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, Best R&B Song, Best R&B Rap/Sung Collaboration and Best R&B Collaboration with Vocals. This feat ties with Lauryn Hill, Alicia Keys and Norah Jones, who unlike Beyonce, have won in the \\"General\\" category.<br />(...)nd Best R&B Collaboration with Vocals.

B0000047CX|5.0|I owe it, always love it from the very first time I heard it back in Paris in 70s. It's timeless, elegant and soothing. Buy it.
B0000C6E4D|2.0|The other two Sarah McLaughlan CD's were much different; each song on them seemed to be one that got stuck in your head. They all had wonderful, deep, original lyrics sung with an amazing voice. Afterglow is simply awful in comparison. The only song that really jumps out at you like the old ones is 'Fallen' - the rest is, plainly put, filler. Not only are the lyrics less original (dealing a lot more with the industry standards of 'love' and 'love you, but can't let go' and maybe a little more of that overdone 'love' stuff) but a lot of the vocals seem like a monotone in comparison to her other songs; and even those are overshadowed by a too-loud piano track and many useless sound effects. <br />Maybe it grows on you after a while, but I wouldn't know. I haven't listened to it enough if that's the case. The best word to describe it would have to be overproduced.
0783225733|5.0|Director Ron &quot;Opie&quot; Howard gets behind the camera and directs his best film ever....a dramatization of the near-fatal voyage of Apollo 13. Starring Tom Hanks &amp; Kevin Bacon. James Horner's music soars like a rocket throughout the movie...with vocal accompaniment by Annie Lennox. (The Eurythmics) A great movie to watch.
630529142X|3.0|I went to see this movie expecting something like Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore, unfortunately that wasnt what i saw. This movie is still pretty good and has an original story line, im not sure if i recomend it to everyone, maybe just the people who LOOOOVE Adam Sandler.
B00000099Y|1.0|All I hear on this bored from the slobbering 5-star reviewers is stuff along the lines of &quot;Tool are so life-altering and deep and complex and smart&quot; and &quot;they are such talented musicians!&quot;  Well, playing in 9/8 time and sounding like a pukey, angsty imitation of Yes (yikes) does not a great band make.  Adam Jones plays like an amateur Robert Fripp, Danny Carey sounds like a drummer who just hits everything because he can't do anything else, and Maynard...well, Maynard sounds like he's got a sock up his nose.  As for Tool being &quot;deep&quot;--the day I started wearing black and listening to this 'intelligent' music (you know, the music that has songs titles like (A)enema, which are worthy of Blink-182) was the day I realized that I was a musical genius and all those 'stupid' fans who listened to wimpy bands like Pavement and the Minutemen were just deceiving themselves.  Tool are soooooooo deep and talented, they could be a Emerson, Lake, and Palmer tribute band; now they just need a pretentious symphony orchestra to drag behind them and cover up their trashy tunes.
B00000K3UU|4.0|I think this is a great movie, adam sandler shows a different but good side. I reccomend this to anyone.
B00000099Y|1.0|This is what Sonic Youth would sound like if they were: a) completely untalented), b) more concerned with time signatures and boring textures than with interesting compositions and c) obsessed with being metal's answer to both Uriah Heep and Blink-182.  If you like hearing a useless piece of white noise that drones on for 14 minutes with no progressions and only a smattering of mumbled curse words in between, then &quot;Aenima&quot; is the album for you.
B0000DD7NL|1.0|I received as a Christmas gift. I am glad that I didn't have to pay for it! Loved the first album, but this one...I don't know. It's apparent also why the producer left the last selection on the CD for last. It was painful listening to it as I took down my tree. An accomplished pianist she may be, but the songs are boring. It was nice to know I had A Rod Stewart CD at hand.
1400034779|2.0|Having read so many glowing reviews, I picked this book up and promptly signed my name in it.  When I was done - I wished I hadn't written in it, so that I could return it!!!  I found this book slow moving, trite and uninspiring.  Maybe if I had more knowledge of Africa and the every day slang used there, I would have become more involved in the stories.  I'd say if you want a book to read that's &quot;just a book to read&quot;, and not something you become immersed in, then this book would be ok.
B00005JMCW|5.0|She is so great in this movie. She and Lohan make a great pair. The movie is funny as well as fun. Forget about any of the previous versions of Freaky Friday. This version beats out Foster's 70's version, and there's no water skiing in this version.
0316666343|3.0|I just finished this book a while ago, after having read it on and off for about a week. Normally, that is far longer than it usually takes me to read a book, so either the book was really bad, or I'm just senile. Neither is true in this case, but I will say, it did disappoint me a bit.<br />We've all read the reviews about this book being simply awe-inspiring, life-changing, lovely. I had seen it in a billion places, screaming to be bought, but initially, the title turned me off. I knew it was going to be sad. I knew it was going to be about death. I knew it was going to be some modern day coming-of-age something. Sigh. I didn't want to read it, but I knew from experience that the books I resist are the ones that seize me. So I gave in.<br />Initially, I gave in at school during lunch, when I saw a friend holding a school copy. I picked it up from her and cracked it open, commenting, &quot;I heard this was supposed to be really good. Is it?&quot; She said it was, and so, propelled by her positivity, I started reading. I really liked it to begin with; it was gripping in a tingly way, and tingly is always a good thing. Of course, lunch ended, and I vowed to drag myself to the library and pick up my own copy. And so I did.<br />I continued reading, and I was fascinated by the concept of heaven presented in the book: a beautiful place, shaped by your whims, comforting the way a fleecy blanket and hot chocolate are. I didn't cry through any of this book, however. Knowing that Susie is dead as the book starts allays some of the fear that it will hurt to discover, but at the same time, something was lacking. To look back on it, I would say plot. <br />Yes, plot. <br />Any good novel needs a strong plot. This is why, as much as I hate the book looking back at it, She's Come Undone was a GOOD piece of coming-of-age literature. It hooked me like a fish, a pathetic, flopping fish who didn't want to enjoy the book but did, and was completely drained after finishing the thing in two days flat. <br />The Lovely Bones just didn't seem to do that. The jacket boasts of Susie's heaven, but we never really get to experience it as much as we'd like. For a book that touches upon one of the greatest mysteries of life, being torn away from her heaven to watch the tortured lives of the people back on Earth gets dry, fast. There comes a point where all the characters seem to just embark on completely separate journeys, and none of them really mesh with each other anymore. Yes, they still live together, yes, they still communicate with each other, but that integral stickiness of the relationships just seems to get weaker as the book progresses. Whatever this book was trying to become- I don't even know yet- stops, and is replaced by short commentaries on the lives of the people Susie once knew, dictated by Susie. <br />It's hard to describe what it is the book is lacking. It has bits of everything, but really contains all of nothing. It has a plot in the beginning, but soon drops it to delve into separate lives punctuated by semi-interesting occurences. It has character development, but soon the character development manifests itself into boring events that could be classified as schizoid mannerisms that aren't captivating at ALL. And yeah, it does have themes, like the afterlife and death and family and so on, but rather than being richly interwoven into the story, they seem sad and diluted, stretched out to max potential before the arc of story comes crashing back down. <br />I feel bad to be squishing under my shoe a book that struggles to be brillant, especially when it's about death, and when it tries to make it heartfelt. Naturally, a death is going to affect a family. Sebold does a good job of capturing this in the first third of the book, when the murder was still fresh, but soon it literally becomes what it feels like: a chronicle of lives. Merely lives. That's it. And despite the REALLY weird, unexpected psuedo-ending, it feels like it neverreally began.
B000001FLI|5.0|Roy Buchanan is the worlds most underrated guitar player. He can hold his own with B.B., Clapton, and yes evern Hendrix. Buchanan is an amazing player with such a unique style and approach. He is truly one of the top 10 guitar players of all time and this album shows us that the most out of all Roys albums. Of all his albums this one was played with the most passion and fury! 'Cajun' is without a doubt the best track on the album with a killer solo, well the guitar through the whole song is amazing really. Other highlights would be 'Haunted House' and 'Sweet Dreams' both of which are Buchanan classics! Roy Buchanan is an album that each and every guitar player should own!
B00005QGAZ|5.0|Michael and his talent never seem to amaze me....This is a wonderful.....CD.
B000089RVR|5.0|I love this cd. It has sweeping ballads haunting vocals and mezmorizing lyrics. Dido has the voice of an angel, her lyrics are deep n the backing music is at times haunting and at times seductive. My favorite tracks include, Mary's In India and When Your  40. Buy it you wont regret it :)
B00000099Y|5.0|i must have heard this album 3,000 times since it's release, and some of the drum licks still make me twitch when i hear them...now THAT's perfection...throw in Maynard's sick vocals and lyrics, and how could you NOT like this album?  this is music in its purest form.
0385512104|4.0|Christopher's first person account of his story is the best reason for reading this book.  If you want to know what goes on in the mind of an autistic teenager, read this book.  Mark Haddon is to be commended for his delightful work, and since the book has become so popular, I'm sure the public will understand this developmental problem in a way that doctors and educators will never be able to explain in a better way.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I bought the DVD and am happy I did.  JEFF LYNNE, DHANI HARRISON and ANOUSHKA SHANKAR performed THE INNER LIGHT.  DHANI HARRISON provides vocals with JEFF LYNNE.  JEFF LYNN and ERIC CLAPTON perform I WANT TO TELL YOU, IF I NEEDED SOMEONE and BEWARE OF DARKNESS.  The band it top notch with drummers JIM KELTNER and JIM CAPALDI.  George's son, DHANI, is on stage playing guitar and providing supporting vocals.  JOE BROWN performs an outstanding version of HERE COMES THE SUN.  TOM PETTY AND THE HEARTBREAKERS set is the weak portion of the show.  TOM PETTY performs TAXMAN and I NEED YOU with THE HEARTBREAKERS before bringing JEFF LYNNE and DHANI HARRISON back on stage for HANDLE WITH CARE.  PETTY'S vocals sound weak.  HANDLE WITH CARE is saved by the vocals of JEFF LYNNE.  RINGO performs PHOTOGRAPH and HONEY DON'T before introducing PAUL MCARTNEY.  PAUL plays FOR YOU BLUE and the talks about GEORGE.  PAUL plays SOMETHING on ukelele before the entire band comes begans.  SOMETHING is excellent as are WHILE MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS(CLAPTON,MCCARTNEY and STARR), ALL THINGS MUST PASS(MCCARTNEY) and MY SWEET LORD by BILLY PRESTON.  The bonus features are great with interviews with band members and rehearsal footage of George's band and Ravi's band.
1559408898|4.0|This is definitely one DVD worth getting. I have myself owned it for some years, and it is worth having if only because of the content it carries, which MGM does not include in their version. There's been a lot of grousing about the presentation of this version of the film--the sound isn't 5.1, it's not anamorphic, no really cool features, and all that--but bear in mind that this version was produced during the relative infancy of the DVD format, when the capabilities of the disc had yet to be fully exploited as they are today. For its time, it was a good package, even at its &quot;collector's&quot; price level (which was typical of such a product at that time, at least coming from Criterion). If you can find it, by all means get it--I doubt much of the content will be repeated in future editions from MGM, even in a &quot;Special Edition&quot;.
0385504209|4.0|While this book was a complete thriller and everything you would want in a book (you really won't be able to put it down), I would have to agree with many of the reviews on here that most of the ideas in here are repeats. It seems like Brown was poring over books like &quot;Holy Grail, Holy Blood&quot; and even Merlin Stone's &quot;When God was a Woman.&quot; Still, this is completely forgiveable because 1) he is introducing religious conspiracy theories (for lack of a better term) to the general public who may not have been familiar with such ideas beforehand and 2)the book is unable to be put down, so kudos to Brown.<br />One of the best things about this book is that you can take an active part in the novel by working through the codes on your own, some of which aren't that difficult. Also, after reading this book, there were so many other books I wanted to read because of the many genres Brown touches on -- the life of Da Vinci, art analyzation, scientific revolutionaries (Newton, for example), religions (pagan and Christianity), secret societies and so on.
B0000CNY27|5.0|I think this is a beautifully done dvd because it has features you can only dream of.(like the deleted opening sequence)I think this is one of John Carpenter's best films and I recommend this dvd to anyone who is a Carpenter or Kurt Russell fan. A true cult Classic!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This album shows a real maturity throughout that is not as present on any of her earlier albums.  It proves that she is capable of evolving her sound, so expect her to be around for awhile!
B0000640S3|2.0|This is just a movie, a reminder for those of you who take rambo and speak of rambo as a real life person, this movie based on previous two, which were really successfull in us and europe, so<BR>if hollywood can cash in on it, you got rambo 3. this movie is not to be taking seriously, i say hot shots part deux is more serious then this movie, this movie gives what it meant to give one man violent entertainment.<BR>     this movie is for that special night with your girlfriend, cheap fun, unless you thing your girlfriend will want man like rambo, instead of you, then get something else, but just remember movie is a movie, how many men were fooled by it and became soldiers to look like rambo and impress females, then realizing, too late, that in real life it is totally different, and no amount of training will protect anyone from unexpected bullet, don't be fools, real war is much, much worst and not a cheap hollywood entertainment you could turn off when you tired of violence...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|. . . Watching more Firefly!<br />My cousin suggested &quot;Firefly&quot; to me at a Christmas gathering of sorts. He told me that it is the kind of show I might be into. To say he was &quot;right&quot; would be something of an understatement.<br />I recently finished a two day &quot;Firefly&quot; marathon, it was my first time watching the series at all, and I am hooked. It is a sci-fi western, which is an ungodly cool combination.  <br />The show has some of the best written characters on T.V. and thats only after some 13 odd episodes. I don't know the Simpsons as well as I know Wash or Zoe or Jayne and I've been watching that family since I was a small child. Each episode is different with something new to offer to the table, each memorable in every aspect.<br />It really hit the ground running, sprinting even. It's a ruttin shame that Fox, in all it's wisdom, decided to can it so early. Just icing on the cake Fox, they took Family Guy, Futurama, and now Firefly. Shame on you Fox...shame.
0451163516|4.0|This book was a first Follett book I've ever read. It wasn't disappointed at all. I like that book, and I've read it very fast. Story is fast moving and not hard to believe, characters very natural and alive. That book pushed me to read another Follett's stories, and I guess that was most important thing about it. I can't say that is his \\"top of the top\\", but anyway it definitely strong four and good point to start with Follett.
B0000CDL93|2.0|The shame regarding this movie is that Oliver Stone purposely put inaccurate items in it.  They weren't &quot;mistakes&quot; or literary<BR>license, they were just lies and biased &quot;story&quot; telling. I have to admit it was a fairly well made movie , but it is just propaganda. It would take too long to go over all the things that are wrong or made up.  However, I will use one.  <br /> The main premise of Stone, is that JFK was going to pull out of Vietnam and therefore the &quot;Military Industrial Complex&quot; had to kill him. Stone shows JFK in an interview stating that the fight in Southeast Asia was &quot;Vietnam's problem not ours&quot;.  Stone uses this to show that Kennedy was going to pull out of Vietnam. What he DOESN'T show you is that later in the SAME interview, Kennedy states that we can not allow communism to spread and must hold the line against China and the Soviet Union.  This is what LBJ did and Kennedy most likely would have done the same, especially since he's the one that sent the U.S. in there in the first place.<br />   There are dozens of similar items through out the movie that<BR>Stone &quot;conveniently&quot; omits from the movie.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of the viewers of the movie know very little about the details of the assassination and will take this movie as truth and not a fictionalized verson of real events which is what it is....<br />   You must watch this movie as a well made mystery having VERY little to do with the real world. And to have a good view of what happened in Dallas that day needs a lot more research.  And a good start is Gerald Posner's &quot;Case Closed&quot;, it's a very well written documented researched book.  And this despite the previous philistine reviewer that knocked the book, some people will only close their eyes to the truth.<br />   Just remember, to take the Stone's JFK movie seriously you have to believe that the following groups were involved in the <BR>assassination of the President with NO ONE talking in 40+ years:<br /> Secret Service, FBI, CIA, Dallas Police, Lyndon Johnson, Robert Kennedy, along with support people at all levels of government.  That would be tens of thousands of people with no one admitting anything, no deathbed confessions, no anonimous submission to a newpaper or the news ...NOTHING !!! Nixon couldn't keep a secret within his cabinet but thousands of people keep the secret to the crime of the century......  How ridiculous is that...?
B00005QZWI|1.0|When I first listened to this CD I was immediately shocked and dismayed that it doesn't begin with the music that the film begins with, the Ring Theme. Listening all the way through I was disgusted to discover that a version of the Ring Theme only graces the last 20 seconds of track 15. AND THAT'S IT!!  Now the film boasts a rich and complex set of themes, so there's still plenty of material to fill out the disk. But this error in judgment (or whatever it is) should not be overlooked. I give this CD one star to call attention to what I judge to be an unforgivable screw up.
0375414053|5.0|This book was wonderful an a very honest look at the life of a working mother with two children.  It was well written and funny, and best of all kept my attention throughout its entirety without the storyline ever lagging.
B0000000KW|4.0|Ringo Starr is definitely just as much of a legend as his Beatle compadres, and this album proves it.  WEIGHT OF THE WORLD is by far the best song Ringo has done since PHOTOGRAPH and IT DON'T COME EASY, but other songs are great as well.  Listen to I DON'T BELIEVE YOU and you feel you are listening to the Beatles all over again. Or try IN A HEARTBEAT and you imagine the Beach Boys. DON'T GO WHERE THE ROAD DON'T GO is definitive ELO. Does this mean Ringo is not original?  Not at all, it proves Ringo can definitely &quot;get by with a little help from his friends&quot;.  If you don't have it, BUY IT!!
0375713751|2.0|This book stressed me out..... I spend most of the time hoping she would get her act together so she (and I) could relax. As a working mom it depressed me... and I truly could not relate to her.
B00004XONN|4.0|Every track on this CD is worth listening to. I do not suggest it for a new Radiohead listener though, but maybe use it as a second Radiohead album purhcase. &quot;National Anthem&quot; starts off the amazing record with its electronic rock feel, which flows throughout the rest of the tracklist. &quot;In Limbo&quot; is probably my favorite song, and then &quot;Motion Picture...&quot; is one of the many mellow-ish, new age tracks, that really chills the listeners out. Great album, a must have.
0156027321|5.0|First, I would like to say that I understand the opinions of many, but not all of the reviewers who gave this book a very low rating.  Some of what they say is true.  The imagery in this novel could become very disturbing, yet I support its inclusion.  It adds to the books overall feeling of honesty, which remains, despite an odd ending.<br />  Life of Pi is about a young Indian boy who attempts to travel on a cargo ship with most of his family's zoo to North America.  On the way, the ship crashes for a reason that is not revealed.  Pi and three others escape on a lifeboat.  After some vile deaths, a journey to rival many others takes place across the vast span of the Pacific Ocean.  The landing in Mexico is hardly the end of the story.<br />  I do recommend this book, because of its unpredictable story and the amazing perspectives it gives the reader.  I have given as few details of the story as I could, while being completely honest, as to not spoil the book.  However, I recommend that you read no reviews before the book and make your own decision.  Don't even read this one. :)
B00008H2LB|5.0|This is the best CD ever, there is no song on here i didnt like.  I would even say it is slightly better then hybrid theory!  If you prefer Rage Against the Machine to linkin park then shame on you! Linkin Park is way better then metalica, they are old grandads!  My favorite songs are nobodys listening, from the inside, lying from you, and faint.  Buy this CD! And if u dont like it you suck!
B00005JLPK|5.0|Omg, this movie is one of the best i've seen in a while, i read the book on which the movie is based on and is the same, but when u actually see it as a movie is even better. Salma Hayek was flawless, she nailed that role to perfection as did Alfred molina, they really captured how their characters really were. This movie is a MUST SEE!
B0000CFW87|5.0|This CD shows a further maturation in Josh's style.  He experiments with a broader vocal range.  At first listen it sounded a little more &quot;produced&quot; than #1 but you would expect that considering his success.  The pace of the selections is similar to CD #1 with a few true ballads and a few more up-tempo tracks.  I am one of three true Josh fans in the family and we all think this CD is a notch above the last, and if you loved #1 you will love #2.
B00004SCX6|3.0|I got this cd when I was in the 5th grade when Britney Spears came out and some of the songs are really good. My personal favorites are \\"Stronger\\", \\"Don't go knockin' on my door\\", \\"What u see is what u get\\" and \\"Can't make u love me\\", she has some good songs on this cd, I think its good, but not better than the 1st.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Due to having to work on fridays, I only caught two episodes when Firefly was airing. It didn't make alot of sense to me but it seemed funny, and diffrent. Then it got cancelled.<br />A got the DVD set simply because there hasn't really been anything tremendously diffrent on TV and I remembered Firefly as being someything of an oddity.<br />From the pilot episode to the bonus &quot;Hero of Canton&quot; song and everything in between I was completely enthralled in a two day marathon. This show does everything right, drama, humor, visuals, music and charecters while breaking the rules of cinemotgraphe, scifi and pretty much Television. <br />I don't know if I can really explain Firefly or why it's now one of my favorite shows every. It's not that it's all too complicated, every little aspect just eminates so much wonder and heart. The Firefly world contained some the greatest charecters, stories and concepts that I have ever seen plus some of the most memorable one-liners to boot.<br />Now that Firefly seems too be finding more popularity after it's cancellation, may it fly again in some form or another.
0345350499|4.0|I read this book barely knowing anything about the Arthurian legend save a little bit about the knights of the Round Table. I was amazed at the actul depth this novel carried. All characters were multidimensional with inner conflicts that made them seem human instead of fiction. Another great aspect of the novel concerned the heavily debated topic of theology and acceptance of another's religion. The reader becomes so heavily involved in the story and starts to feel real sorrow and pity for the characters involved. I somehow felt the ending was a little weak but perhaps that is what happens when all the characters grow old an loose their childlike innocence and fervor. Unrequitted and unattainable love seem to be two major themes in this novel aside from there religious debate. Overall this novel contained a lot of depth and aside from its ficticious nature, a lot situations many can relate to. The setting also plays a huge part in the novel. Marion Simmer Bradley does an excellent job with description in this novel.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Like many reviews and expectations we all had, yep I was flying at half-mast throught most of this CD.  Being a big fan of both RATM and Soundgarden, I was hoping - like most reviewers were - for something that would just BLOW ME AWAY.  It came on many songs on this CD, but after reading about band break-ups ALREADY while this was either being made or getting ready to tour, I got suss...Chris isn't exactly one for putting himself aside for anything, and I am sure the RAGE guys are not going to take anything lying down...so where does one go from here?<br />WELL, just listen to the CD.  I had to put it in my 'listened to it, lets give it a go again in a few months' bin.  An YES, it sounds fresh, heartfelt, angry, loud and just plain what I wanted after hearing all of what's 'out there'.  Sweep the expectations under the carpet, and treat this as something 'new' and NOT something from it's creators, and you got one kick-a** CD...<br />I only hope that Audioslave thinks about stretching a few boundaries for the next CD.  This one had 'delivered' a certain sound and umph that their fans expected, yet judging by a lot of the reviews, did fall short of the mark here and there.  I am confident that the combined talents of this SUPER BAND will bring us something that we will be RAGING about for years to come...(e.g. the first RATM CD, Superunknown)
B000006OS2|1.0|&quot;Good Times&quot; video is terrible.  The quality looks like it was filmed from a picture playing in a theater.  Color is bad and there are lots of lines in the picture.
B00005JKHZ|5.0|I GOT THE DVD JAN 9, AND IT WAS ONLY $9.00, THE PICTURE IS A 10, THE SOUND IS ABOUT A 8, IT HAS THE US, AND THE UK VERSIONS ON THE DVD, AND ITS WIDESCREEN. A GREAT CAR CHASE MOVIE.
B0000AKY7R|5.0|This disc is an absolute knock out. The music has withstood the test of time, the lp in vinyl form was released in 1973 as a departure from the gold lined, glittering road of commercial success that Santana had paved. Dissapointing to many, a revelation to others, this lp at the time was met with great skeptimism and controversy. Afer all how could someone duplicate John Coltrane's suite, &quot;A Love Supreme? &quot; What was Santana doing with another guitar player, and not just any guitar player  but John MCLaughlin. And who was the Eastern fellow in the robe?  And why did he look so different and what was up with the white oufits?  The answers were in the music and Santana was definitely on a journey or  a spiritual quest . The attempt to record &quot;A Love Supreme,&quot; still fresh in the minds of jazz heads as the one of the ultimate Trane compositions that had religious qualites  besides outstanding technique and tremendous exploration seeemd almost blasphemous. Santana and McLaughlin's version is a jazz-rock fusion masterpiece where the guitar solos are presented in blistering fashion at a frenetic pace that was otherworldly, almost to the point of  inhuman speed and dexerity as though the other side were intervening to guide the  then young muscians along the righteous path. Beginning with the faster than the speed of light fret work slowed down by the organ tempo to Trane' s &quot;ta-ta ta tah&quot; melody only to be pushed further along, at  a blazing guitar pace that is (was)like to two gunslingers firing endless rounds of ammo from a machine gun. The lightining pace slows and builds several times in an expressive recreation of the spiirt of Trane, free flowing improvisation kept in check by the lyrical beauty of  &quot;A Love Supreme.&quot; It is a beautiful thing. Another John Coltrane composition is presented  which also happens to be one of my favorite(like anybody cares)Trane tunes entitled &quot;Naima. &quot; The guitarists trade in their electric guitar speed  for a softer with less edge melody that is soothing and lovely much like the original by Trane. It is one of the most beautiful  jazz ballads ever written and performed with exquisite tenderness and respect. In a sense this was (is) a tribute disc , a further exploration of the spiritual path through music, breaking the chains and confinement of commercial success to make a musical statement graced in light and love along the lines of what Trane did when he recorded &quot;A Love Supreme&quot;. There is(was) nothing irreverent here but rather Santana was(is) paying homage. Take a look at the names of the songs. &quot;Let Us Go into the House of the Lord,&quot; Meditation&quot; and &quot;The Divine Life.&quot; Santana was leaving and anyone who wanted to see where he was going could go or compare notes from their own experiences. The guitar work by both of thee guys was(is) just amazing.  The interchange , from one channel to the other is unGodly or better yet, inspired by God. There is just enough variety in terms of  fast guitar work and slower accoustic  sounds to create a balance. However the interchange between the two guitarists is absolutely incredible and  not to be missed if you like rock guitar. For that matter the whole set of musicians  is like an allstar cast with Billy Cobham and Jan Hammer sharing the drum roles along with Don Alias. The stellar cast further includes th late Armando Peraza on congas and James (Mingo) Lewis on percussion. If you are rebuilding your collection or rediscovering your musical treasures add this one to the collection. If you are new to Santana and keep reading old grey beards refer to his older albums that were better, than this might one of those. Not for everyone but surely for those that appreciate outstanding inspired guitar work with only hints of the Latinesque elements often associated with Carlos Santana.guitar speed  for a softer with less edge melody that is soothing and lovely much like the original by Trane.

B000089RVX|4.0|I had heard of Evanescence a year before I actually bought it, but I now love it! Amy has a beautiful, haunting voice, and their songs aren't like anything I had heard before. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because it isn't as good as everyone says it is, and that fact that it is so popular turns me off. But I can't deny that this CD is worth the buy. Going Under, Bring Me to Life, My Immortal(the rock version), My Last Breath, and Tourniquet are my favorites. Haunted and Hello could definately be taken off the album. If you like this type of music, I would highly recommend Within Temptation, another really good band.
B0000DZEA1|4.0|(beware: some small spoiling for those who have not yet seen the film)<br />I would simply echo the previous reviews:  incredible as is, but missing a couple of pieces that should definitely have been there.  Most notably missing are, as has been stated, the music for the charge of Rohan during the siege of Minas Tirith; the other disappointment for me was missing the music for the sequence where Sam carries Frodo up the side of Orodruin to the Cracks of Doom.  It is a choral arrangement of the Fellowship theme, and is probably the only choral music in the entire three films to be written in powerful, major chords instead of the minor dissidence associated with the Nazgul, Sauron, etc.  Wonderful onscreen as it accompanies the sunlight breaking through the black smoke of the mountain and lighting their path.  <br />I have to say a word about the particular piece &quot;The White Tree&quot;.  This is, IMHO, and considering Williams and other great movie music writers, one of the (if not the) finest pieces written for a motion picture sequence.  The furious string arpeggios driven by the earth-shaking low brass and trumpet fanfares drip of Mahler, Brahms, and Wagner, and is some of the best writing I have heard this side of 1900.  It is the high point of the music for the three films.  And to hear it in the film setting doubles the effect.  Awesome.<br />I would also suggest that to hear all the music from FOTR thru TTT to the end of ROTK shows a definite progression upwards from mediocre to phenomenal, as it should, and is a very satisfying experience which can be repeated often with little or no increasing boredom.<br />Four stars do not reflect the quality of the music--just the omission of some very good stuff.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|By itself this film gets 5 stars but when viewed with Revolutions it gets about a three.  I'll explain more about this later.  When I saw the film in the theaters I was blown away.  It was a combination comic book come to life, a philosophical excercise and a rumination on the great conspiracy theories.<br /><br />There are very few movies that make me literally sweat while watching them, Saving Private Ryan and The Exorcist being two examples.  This movie had so many of them I was exhausted after seeing it.  I'm an avid motorcyclist and the chase on the freeway made my knees weak.  I haven't watched the behind the scenes making of the chase on the DVD just because I don't want to ruin the magic.  I'm sure 90 percent of it was done digitally but it doesn't matter while watching the film, it's that well done.  The ghost twins are the best movie villains since Darth Vader.  The scene with Morpheus slicing the SUV open is a visual work of art.<br /><br />All of the action in the world wouldn't amount to anything if the story was no good but this one is interesting and fun to follow.  The twists, turns and theories presented kept my cousins, brother and me discussing the possibilities for a few days after seeing it.  I totally disagreed with critics and fans that the dialog and story line dragged down the action.  The first Matrix was a good, solid, streamlined science fiction story where this one is dense and complex but it never overwhelmed the action.  I think anyone who had that complaint also had a short attention span.  There were some slow moments in Reloaded but I remember thinking the same thing the first time I saw The Matrix.  And while I loved the story here that leads to the big problem with Revolutions.  The entire build up for this movie was a waste of time.  Everything my family and I discussed after seeing this movie was much more interesting than what was presented in Revolutions.  I felt cheated that the payoff was just a big long fight with no follow up on the ideas presented in Reloaded.  It instantly made Reloaded absolete.  It feels like you're just wasting your time re-watching knowing the end will disappoint.  Revolutions wasn't a complete waste, it was still a decent movie just not the one I was hoping for.  Maybe I had built up my own expections too far.  I did enjoy the way the story ended.  It had an ambiguous ending that was fitting.<br /><br />I still love this movie but I would have wished for a better companion piece to go with it.presented in Reloaded.

0913866156|5.0|In addition to the glowing reviews you're already seeing on this particular deck, there's a little bit more to add....and I do so without paying attention to any of the nutty 'warnings' related reviews or 'not for the weak at heart' rubbish.<br />Decks are largely a matter of taste...some will tickle yours, and some will not. Over time, decks which you thought were amazing looking will start to seem trite and juvenile. What I'm not going to worry about here is the taste aspect. That's for you to decide and will depend largely on your influences.<br />What can be said for certain is that there's a lot of interesting symbology on the Crowley-Thoth deck. Unlike my other standard favourite (the Rider-Waite), the symbology and correspondence references are immediately obvious, even to those new to that aspect of the readings. <br />Having one deck of each of the sizes for this set, I'd reccomend the 3 1/4&quot; x 5 1/2&quot; (large/oversized) deck for those meditating on or studying the artwork of the set. It makes the various archetype symbologies far easier to discern...particularly if your eyes are getting old like mine...:)<br />Visually appealing, easy to engage, and as deep as you're willing to go with them, this deck provides a wealth of reading inspiration, and has many great books available for deeper interpretation of the various influential correspondences referenced by it.<br />Definitely a great staple deck for personal or group reading.
B000002IM7|5.0|Not only are these guys GREAT musicians, but they are GREAT FRIENDS as well!! Buy their albums... you won't be sorry!!
B000000H6D|5.0|This is one my favorite albums of ALL time.  If I had to make a Top 5 list of my favorite albums, &quot;Bloody Kisses&quot; would surely be number one or two.  <BR>I feel that this album is Type O Negative's best work.  The album in which all of their other albums are compared.  &quot;Bloody Kisses&quot; blends the perfect balance of &quot;goth&quot; undertones, and psychedelic overtones.  Imagine Black Sabbath playing very slowly and the Doors sitting in...all while taking acid!  The music is beautiful, dark, tranquil, etc.  The lyrics deal with love lost and the pain that it leaves in its place, a feeling we've all had at least once in our lives!  There is also a wonderful cover of Seals and Crofts &quot;Summer Breeze&quot;, a highlight of the album.  <BR>This album has been with me for about ten years, and out of all the CD's that I owned over that period of time, &quot;Bloody Kisses&quot; has been the rare album that I can play over and over again and never tire of!<BR>So, buy this album, grab a girl/boy, buy a cheap bottle of wine, drive to your nearest cemetary and blast this album in your car...enjoy!!!

0446677450|1.0|This book is a best-seller because people want to believe that there is a fast and easy way to get rich.  If you read Kiyosaki's books and try to take notes, however, you will realize that there is very little practical information and a lot of blanket statements.  This is NOT a personal finance book nor is there a shred of evidence anywhere that Kiyosaki has become rich through investments (he is probably rich now from the sales of all of his books).  There isn't even any evidence that his &quot;rich dad&quot; ever existed.  With his apparent preference for real-estate, he was lucky to publish his books during a downturn in the stock market and an upturn in the housing market.<br />Many of his statements about &quot;what the rich teach their children&quot; are simply backhanded ways of saying that insider trading and other illegal schemes are OK.  Forming a corporation really will not help your personal financial situation (ask a good CPA what the benefits of forming a corporation are) nor will it enable you to buy a Mercedes that you couldn't buy otherwise. <br />If this book makes you think about your personal financial situation, that is definitely a good thing.  There are many books that will REALLY help, like Eric Tyson's &quot;Personal Finance for Dummies&quot; and &quot;Investing for Dummies&quot; (don't let the dummies part fool you) or anything by Jane Bryant Quinn.  &quot;The Millionaire Next Door&quot; is full of actual statistics about actual millionaires and is much more inspiring to people who are realists.  There are numerous good books out there about starting or buying a business, but they all take you through the work you need to do in a step-by-step manner.  It's abolutely worth reading financial books, but this one will not provide you with ANY practical advice.
B00008PW2D|2.0|OMG, what a waste of time.  This season was so terrible.  The first time I saw SATC I thought that those women were so inspiring and free, I felt in love with all of them, too bad I can't say the same thing about this season.  Carried looked older and tired and I didn't like the fact that they tried to hide her big belly, it looked obvious and ridiculous (couldnt' they wait for her to give birth?).  Her jokes were not at all funny and they were kind of force.  Samantha was disgusting, gosh... what a repulsive pathetic woman.  The other two were kind of the same, thank God!

B00003CXV4|1.0|I'd heard that Sweet November was simply awful. So I decided to try it because oftentimes awful movies can be excellent unintentional comedies. I wasn't disappointed. While it is one of the worst romantic movies ever made (Keanu Reeves? Give me a break) it works very well as camp.<br />From Reeves' excrutiatingly awful &quot;Hot Dog&quot; presentation to his tear-of-pain inducing final denoument with Theron at the end this movie is class A laughs from beginning to end. <br />The juxtaposition of one of the worst, most wooden and lifeless &quot;actors&quot;, Reeves, with one of the most endearing and lively actresses, Theron, gives one the idea that maybe the director is completely clueless. That or he wanted to simply make Reeves look as bad as possible. If that was the director's intention then he succeeded admirably.<br />It also has one of the possibly most embarassing actor scenes of all time when Jason Isaacs completely humiliates himself in a green sequined dress. <br />What a joke of a movie. Definitely an excellent choice for an evening of MST3King with some good friends.
B00008AWOD|4.0|In a time when all rock bands seem to sound the same, Placebo is a miracle. With an almost hypnotic tone to their music, Placebo sings with a silent anger. You can tell from the symbolic title Sleeping with Ghosts that this isn't cheerful rock. Placebo is aboout the bitterness of relationships, and all their songs are filled with grief and disappointment. The highlight is &quot;The Bitter End&quot;, which is about a relationship falling apart in front of their eyes. It's really out there, but its original. And that's a miracle.
B00006DEFA|5.0|This movie was absolutely fabulous. I am just a teenager, who, before I saw this movie, had no interest in classical music. Now, I cannot get it out of my head! This movie captivated me, and I could not stop watching it.       The movie enchants you as we hear the tale of Salieri, the man who claims to have killed Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. In this movie, he explains the triumph, the heartaches, the life, and the death of Mozart.       The way the story is told is incredible. The costumes, the music, the make-up, everything in this movie is perfect. And not to mention the acting.      The acting of Tom Hulce and F. Murray Abraham was pure genius. They did a great job.      This review may be short, but I managed to say what I wanted to in this small amount of words. Please, for your own sake, buy this movie.
B00008DDSC|5.0|Based on Mary Gaitskill's stort story collected in \\"Bad Behavior,\\" \\"Secretary\\" follows a very, very strange kind of love story between a young girl Lee Holloway and a middle-aged lawyer E. Edward Grey who employs her as, yes, a secretary.  Lee is played by splendid Maggie Gyllenhaal (Jake's sister), and Edward by James Spader, who is simply great.  You also see Jeremy Davis and Lesley Ann Warren, but their roles are not as big as the two leads.    <br />The story is simple; it revolves around the said two characters, and the unexpected romance between them.  I said 'romance,' but it is a kind of romance you find in cult-film directors like David Lynch (whose influence is too obviously felt here, and the music here is by Angelo Badalamenti).  Kinky, you might say, and you are right.  <br />Lee, who has a habit of cutting her body, decides to work as a secretary when she finds a vacancy in Edward's office.  But the job meeting with Edward is far from normal.  I won't write it for it is probably the kind of the question many people think most indecent, and sexually harrassing.  <br />But Lee takes the job, and surprisingly, gradually gets a better secretary under the very 'unique' guidance of Edward, who tells her the 'right' way of doing the jobs.  But when their mutual feelings comes closer to love, teacher/student relation also comes close to \\"Bad Behavior,\\" or very sadomasochistic love relation between them.<br />You may think, if you read this, the film is repulsive.  Surely, to some, it may be.  As I said, films like David Lynch or Pedro Almodobar can be the touchtone.  If you love them, try it.  If you prefer old-fashioned way of exressing love (which I do not dislike either), you may be shocked to see it.      <br />James Spader is always at his best when he portrays this kind of a character with intelligence and repressed desire, as you saw in \\"Sex, Lies, and Videotape.\\"  He is as good as that, but more astonishing is the newcomer Maggie Gyllenhaal, who succeeds in displaying the natural transformation of a girl -- a girl to a woman.  No one can deny her enormous talent without which the film could be very simplistic exploitation of sexual desire.  <br />However, the fact is, it is not.  And the two main characters are realized with compassionate touch of the director.  I like them; I understnd them; only that possibly I cannot follow the path they went.
B00005Y7L4|5.0|This movie is very gory.  The action sequences mix John Woo shoot outs with George Romero gore.  The best visual from the entire movie is at the beginning, when it shows last years winner, covered in blood, clutching a teddybear and smilling psychotically.<br />  This movie takes place in an alternate pesent.  Students have become disorderly and the government has taken to sending a class out each year to kill one another.  The have collars that explode if no one is killed within a certain time period.<br />  Although the movie satisfied that sick part of me that enjoys violence and death in movies, the plot was rushed and had some holes in it.  The charecters were not developed enough either.  All of which is corrected if you read the novel that the movie is based on.  It is much better (as books always are).  You will actually understand what drives certian characters to their behaviors.  Watch the movie, if you enjoy it or want to understand it more fully read the book as well.

B00005JLKB|2.0|It doesn't seem like that bad of an idea.  Take Superman's teenage past and make it into a TV show.  But it all goes downhill when the WB stepped in and lavished it as a teeniebopper mellow drama with equally annoying and pretensious music from bands that will be hot one day and gone the next.  I actually kind of had high hopes for Smallville; the idea of presenting a teenage Clark Kent before he donned the cape and tights doesn't seem like a bad idea as I said before, but the way Smallville is presented is just plain lame.  Pretty boy Tom Welling doesn't display much range as the future hero, and the rest of the cast, aside from Michael Rosenbaum as future nemesis Lex Luthor, is flat.  There are a few good ideas floating around though: such as making the weekly villians have something to do with the meteor that brought Clark to Earth, Clark's awe as he discovers what he is capable of, and some solid guest stars (Tony Todd and X-Men's Shawn &quot;Iceman&quot; Ashmore), but other than that Smallville is another teeniebopper mellow drama with wasted potential.  Maybe I'm wrong though; maybe the show will display brilliance later on in life like Buffy the Vampire Slayer did, but for some reason I just don't see it happening.

044022165X|2.0|I think I understand some of the enthusiasm for The Rainmaker; I too found that I wanted to keep reading, that the plot was energetic enough to push me through the pages.  When I read overall praise of the book, however, I'm baffled.  It was entertaining, but very flawed.  I found the characters flat and  dimensionless, and never even felt as if I had a sense of protagonist Rudy Baylor.  He seemed a living stereotype-- the bright, well-meaning, down on his luck, little-guy lawyer, blue-collar background, who takes on &quot;the man&quot; in one of his many incarnations: an enormous white-collar corporate conspiracy.  Satisfying, but hardly original.  There was no greater depth to either Rudy's character or the conflict; both were kept on a simple, surficial level, one most conducive to a fast-paced plot.  <br />Indeed, most of the characters were slightly embellished stereotypes, were vehicles for plot and never real people.  Rudy's bosses were the heart-of-gold petty criminals; the opposing lawyers were Ivy League money-grubbers, etc., etc.  The girl, Kelly, came off the worst.  I found sitting through the patronizing relationship between Kelly and Rudy sickening-- Grisham and feminism ought to be on bad terms after this book.  She was a battered woman whom Rudy set out to rescue, but she was never given any autonomy or a character of her own.  She was only an idea, a helplessness embodied, a vehicle by which we were meant to see Rudy's chivalry and good-heartedness.  The scenes of him dispensing advice to her, with a total disrespect for the person she might have been, the way she coped with her situation (which was of course far out of his understanding), were wretched.  But, like any good cardboard cut-out, she obediently fell in love with him and seemed grateful for his condescension.<br />The book was, as I said, satisfying, amusing, but too easy.  Grisham took the easy way out at every step.  We never had to think about sympathizing with the bad guys; we neverhad to contemplate the ethical dilemmas before us, because the 'right' answer was always clear.  We didn't have to struggle through the inner conflicts of the characters because there weren't any such conflicts and there were barely any characters.  If you're home sick, The Rainmaker is a fine choice.  But for substance look elsewhere.
0380789035|5.0|On the cover of my copy of the book, was attached a little sticker that announced: \\"As good as Stephen King or your money back!\\" Well, I want my money back because this book isn't as good as any of King's, it's much, much better. Don't let the bad reviews fool you, this is vintage Neil Gaiman surpassing his writing found in 'Sandman', and further exploring the Jungian theme of archetypes. If you liked Sandman you will love this.
B000002J0B|5.0|In Houses Of The Holy, it was another awesome effort.  And by this time, I had been wondering how many albums it would take them before their music either became less incredible, or more tiresome.  LZ #5 just kept the streak going.  And I'm quite happy to own this album.<br />  I absolutely enjoyed every song, except for The Crunge.  I tried to like it, but it just hasn't happened.  It seemed to roll on and on.  Maybe if they changed it up half way through, or added something to it.  Excuse me for giving Led Zeppelin suggestions for their music.  But at least it doesn't slow the pace of the album, disrupting the flow of it in any way.<br />  This album also contains my favorite of theirs, The Rain Song.  I've always seen it as delicate and powerful.  Slightly triumphant.  The Ocean and The Song Remains The Same are both so fun.  And No Quarter is also another one of my favorites.  So ominous.  I've always thought of it as the sequel to Immigrant Song.  Not that they have the same feel, but because of the lyrics and the images I get while hearing them... no forgiveness or pity.<br />  So many good songs on Houses Of The Holy.  You just can't lose with it.
B00005CDNK|5.0|By 1981 both couples in ABBA had divorced. The group carried on, but not for long. The Visitors is ABBA's very last album and to many fans it is the best album they recorded. If you compare The Visitors with their first album Ring Ring it almost seems the albums were recorded by two different groups. In 8 years time ABBA managed to grow from a happy folk band into a serious worldwide succesful business company. Those eight years, however, also caused their relationships to collapse, thereby killing the ambition to continue to record together.<br />The Visitors (a Top 70 hit in the USA in 1982) is a very unusual song for ABBA. It has the subtitle Crackin'Up and this song makes it pretty clear that this album is going to be different compared to the other albums. The lyrics are dealing with Soviet Union dissidents and the music could be described as synth rock. Parts of it, however, seem to be borrowed from their own composition Summer Night City.<BR>Head over Heels should have sounded happy, but it sounds as cool as ice. It became a small hit in continental Europe when it was released as a single in 1982. The music reminds us of a tango, while the lyrics about a 'woman of the world' should sound funny, but they're not really.<BR>When All Is Said And Done is arguably one of the strongest songs ABBA ever recorded. With lyrics dealing with the divorce of Benny & Frida. The song became a Top 30 hit in the States, also charting in several other countries. \\"All my sadness was captured in that song\\", Frida later said.<BR>Soldiers, which sounds like a waltz, is another song with lyrics containing a war theme.<BR>I Let The Music is one of the most unusual songs ABBA eve recorded. It sounds like a stage number and doesn't really fit in on the album. It's classical, it's opera, but it isn't ABBA... Still it's great though!<BR>One Of Us is pure pop again. With lyrics about the end of a relationship it became the first single of the album, topping the charts all over Europe. Alsobecoming a USA single in 1983.<BR>Two For The Price Of One is actually a very funny song, sung by Bjorn. The lyrics are great and the ending is surprising. Regarded by many as the weakest song on the album, but I don't agree. This song was considered to be a single in early 1981.<BR>Slipping Through My Fingers is perhaps the most personal ABBA song ever, with lyrics about how Bjorn and Agnetha's daughter is growing up. In the autumn of 1981 this song was released on single in Japan as a collector's item. <BR>Like An Angel Passing Through My Room is the final song and what a way to end an album! A very haunting melody and a great Frida singing this song. Agnetha and Bjorn are not on the song at all.<BR>The bonus songs:<BR>Should I Laugh Or Cry was the B-side to the One Of Us single in 1981, but was not included on the album. It is actually one of the best songs ABBA ever recorded.<BR>The Day Before You Came is the final song ABBA ever recorded and was released as a single at the end of 1982. Nowadays it is regarded as one of the best songs they ever did, back then the song flopped in almost every country it was released.<BR>Cassandra was the B-side to The Day Before You Came. This typical ABBA song could have fared better than The Day Before You Came if it had been released on single.<BR>Under Attack is the final ABBA single ever released. It didn't became much of a hit, but it's a nice song.<br />As a whole The Visitors is a great final album froma popgroup who dominated the world charts for almost 10 years.<BR>(The album should have included the bonus tracks You Owe Me One [B-side to the Under Attack single], I Am The City [recorded in 1982, released in 1993 on More ABBA Gold] and Just Like That [recorded in 1982, but still unreleased].)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'd like to rant against the should-be-shot Fox TV execs who cancelled this, but other people have apparently done that for me. All I can say is: if you like science fiction and haven't seen Firefly, you are living in a state of sin. This is the best TV science fiction I have ever seen, and this is a serious Babylon 5 fan talking. God, I hope they continue this in some form.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|Underworld is a stylish, gory, action filled horror movie, based on three premises.  The first is Vampires vs. Werewolves--an intriguing idea.  The second is that the audience has been raised on videogames and wants that kind of constant action--debatable as to whether this is helpful or not, but it sure keeps the movie going so you don't really have time to think.  The third, and most unfortunate, is that The Matrix is ripe for plucking.<br />I admit to enjoying Underworld quite a bit, but the entire look of the movie (except, of course, the Werewolf transformations, which were inspired by The Howling) was hauntingly familiar--it's all Matrix, from the costuming to the choreography, the cinematography, the lighting....superbly done, but blatantly stolen.  And with costuming and set design, I suppose that's forgivable, but relying on Matrix for more than that derailed the initial premise too much.<br />Within the first ten minutes I asked myself a question I'd return to over and over: &quot;Why are vampires and werewolves in human form shooting at each other--and missing?&quot;  I really wasn't expecting so much gunplay (and martial arts) in a Vampire/Werewolf movie, and I think the film was the worse for it.  We've seen it all before, it advanced the plot not at all, and seemed grossly out of place for the genre.  The real interest in Vampires vs. Werewolves would be how they physically matched up--and when the film did develop this, it was really unique, with Vampires more agile but incapable of flight or shapeshifting, and Werewolves slower but vastly more powerful.  I personally had no interest in who could outshoot the other, and couldn't quite understand why that played such a huge part in the film.  Furthermore, another unfortunate question popped up:  &quot;How do those guns contain a seemingly infinite number of bullets?&quot; {See premise 2, above--only once in the movie did someone run out of bullets, only a few times was there reloading, but billions and billions of bullets, and lots and lots of missing...this was dumb as far back as Rambo.}<br />Plotwise, though, the Vampires vs. Werewolves idea worked well, and was developed in an interesting and unexpected fashion.  Acting was quite good, with a touch of overacting to be expected from such a topic, and the casting excellent.  Kate Beckinsale, as Trinity, er, no sorry, as the vampire Selene, and Scott Speedman as Neo, oops, I mean Michael, are both gorgeous and convincing.  I was taken aback a bit by Beckinsale's resemblance to Michael Jackson at his most feminine, though...<br />Anyway, in spite of its flaws, it's certainly entertaining and worth watching, at least once.nd billions of bullets, and lots and lots of missing...this was dumb as far back as Rambo.}<br />Plotwise, though, the Vampires vs. Werewolves idea worked well, and was developed in an interesting and unexpected fashion.

B000089RVX|5.0|I was very hesitant to buy this album.  It had a lot of hype, the reviews here were so mixed, and this music is generally not my style (I generally stick to Christian rock and New Age).  However, one song I found by &quot;accident&quot; forced me to buy the album...that song was &quot;My Immortal&quot;.  Though the single version is better than the one on this CD, it is still an unbelievable song.  At first I wasn't too impressed with the rest of the songs...they seemed to sound alike.  But I took a second listen, then third, and well...I can't stop thinking of these songs.  They get under your skin, and as I try to think of the &quot;best&quot; one to illustrate my point I cannot...they are ALL so good.  So do yourself a favor when you purchase it.  Listen to it once, wait a day, then listen to it again.  You WILL get hooked.  I sure was.
B0000TAZBK|3.0|Not only are the Lord of the Rings movies the greatest of all time, the music within them is top notch as well. The music's themes are excellent and inspiring, even toppling heavy-weights, such as Indiana Jones and Star Wars. Everything about the actual music is great, but the box set is overpriced. You can buy all three CD's serparatly for much less money or you can buy the first two and then the special edition third CD with extra DVD for around the same price. The included inserts are only for novelty sake; they can be used as actual CD covers, but my feeling is that replacing the inserts is somewhat useless. However, the inserts are of some quality and make excellent tiny posters. If you like the Lord of the Rings, get the soundtracks, but don't be shy to buy the REAL box set with maybe 12 discs with the entire score when it comes out sometime in the near future.
B00005JMTN|1.0|This is one of history's worst movies. It ranks right up there with Pootie Tang. If the cinema where I saw this movie burned, at least I would have the solace of knowing that a print of this terrible movie was destroyed. <br />I am a huge fan of movies with fantasy components(Brazil, Moulin Rouge, etc.)and therefore found it puzzling that I disliked this movie so virulently. The movie flip flops between the present and a story of the dying father to the fantastic stories that the father tells. The problem is the juxtaposition of fantasy and reality. The doses of reality prevent us from properly entering the world of fantasy; and the sometimes bizzare story scenes make us unable to find any true emotion for the dying father.<br />This movie fails on all counts.<BR>I strongly suggest that anyone considering seeing, buying, or even renting this movie reconsider.<BR>I'm only giving this move a star because I have to.
0393325172|4.0|As one who ripped through all eleven of Forester's magnificent Hornblower books - and greatly enjoyed the film _Master and Commander _ - I was squarely in O'Brian's gun-sites.  I should have been completely captivated by this book.  It describes the formative journey of &quot;Lucky Jack&quot; Aubrey, Captain of the frigate HMS Sophie, and Dr. Stephen Maturin, ship surgeon and naturalist, as they do their part in various Napoleonic naval engagements.<br />The plotting is very well done.  The action is unpredictable and the deck-splintering naval actions are pulse-pounding.  What is vexing is the formidable language the O'Brian has chosen.  Probably historically accurate (too historically accurate?), be prepared to slog through dialogue such as Maturin's complaint about Aubrey's skirt-chasing:<br />&quot;I do indeed, sir, and am much obliged to you for your candour in telling me this; it confirms what was in my mind, and I shall do all I can to make him conscious of the delicacy of his position.  Though upon my word... there are times when it seems to me that nothing short of a radical ablation of the membrum virile would answer, in this case...&quot;<br />Thus, please do not expect Forester's masterful use of language or a direct, Hornblower-esque story.  Nevertheless, if you can handle the period language - and daunting naval terminology - _Master and Commander_ is for you.
B000002LCI|5.0|Sandwiched chronologically between the epic gothdom of Black Celebration and the massive popular appeal of Violator, Music For The Masses sometimes gets lost in the shuffle of Depeche Mode albums.  It didn't have any major stateside hits, and is not as instantly catchy as some of DM's other work.  But it is no less a flawless Depeche Mode album, best appreciated by those who know the band's work intimately.<br />The experimental sounds DM had been flirting with throughout the eighties all show up in force on Music For The Masses.  And as with Some Great Reward and Black Celebration, these songs continue to sound more organic and less like they were pounded out on your mom's Casio keyboard.  (One need only compare a song as complex and hypnotizing as \\"Pimpf\\" with, for example, the twittering and bleeping \\"New Life.\\"  DM are a totally different band in a short span of years.)  Entire songs here are created using samples -- from a choir, a guitar(!), and maybe a spoon against a glass, in addition to a few piano riffs.  As with Black Celebration, frequently the songs here meld and morph into each other so that you only know where the tracks separate from one another because the CD player tells you where.  The end result is an album that frequently seems more at home in the nineties than in the eighties.  Much of this album seems like a predecessor to Enigma's MCMXC a.d. or The Orb's Adventures Beyond The Ultraworld, albums whose composers no doubt would point to DM as inspiration for their work.<br />What I have grown to like best on M4tM are the songs that actually did not become singles.  While \\"Never Let Me Down Again\\" soars high and pleases crowds, \\"Things You Said\\" quietly sinks into your skin like frostbite with Martin's chilling vocal delivery and the somber meandering of a few icy synth notes.  \\"Strangelove\\" is sexy, hook-heavy fun, but what sticks with me longer is the nightmarish self-loathing of \\"To Have And To Hold.\\"  \\"Behind The Wheel\\" is good for a long dark trip by car, but the building sexuality of \\"Pimpf\\" and the apocalyptic decay of \\"Agent Orange\\" are usually more my speed.  Everything on Music For The Masses is good, but when you listen to it long enough, the songs hardest to sing along with become the ones you seek out the most.<br /><br />It's true that these songs are eclectic, lacking the thematic cohesion found in other DM albums.  But certainly there are some salient topics: sexual dominance, submission, and subversiveness (\\"Behind The Wheel,\\" \\"Strangelove,\\" \\"Pleasure Little Treasure\\"); God (\\"Nothing,\\" \\"Sacred\\"); and fidelity (\\"Things You Said,\\" \\"To Have and to Hold\\") come quickly to mind.  They're all consistently good, so there are no songs to skip -- who needs a theme when you've got great music?<br />The title of this album is really quite tongue-in-cheek, as it is quite deliberately aimed not at commercial success but at innovation and experimentation.  It isn't so much that Music For The Masses was not ready for a mainstream audience; it's that the mainstream audience was not yet ready for it.  Five stars for fourteen songs that never leave the jukebox between my ears.dark trip by car, but the building sexuality of \\"Pimpf\\" and the apocalyptic decay of \\"Agent Orange\\" are usually more my speed.

B0000DJZA5|5.0|I was a bit skeptical when I first thought of buying this album.  &quot;Let it Be&quot; was by far my least favorite album by the Beatles, and I felt it's audio quality was lacking. But I had over the years read about the Phil Spector controversy and was curious to hear this approach utilizing 2004 audio technology.  Was I ever suprised!  This is a great album by any standards.  I dare any band of today to produce such an original package with such a brillant producion value.  This album has greatly enhanced my appreciation of the Beatle's talents- this from a guy who's already a well-versed Beatle freak. This is a tight band performing a terrific, varied set of great songs, all sounding crisp and vibrant. Throw out all your contemporary neo-pseudo-minimalist-post-ironic &quot;muzak&quot; and listen to this instead, the best rock music has ever sound.
B000088E6D|1.0|If big band standards are your bag, then you may well feel that Michael Buble is an artist, you want to explore, well don't.  Michael Buble is as camp as a row of tents, and even if you don't mind that, in fact you may well adore Michael Feinstein, who minces the old standards as well as anyone, even though, Buble should still be avoided, for what separates Buble from Feinstein and anyone else who is famous for banging out the big tunes, is the emotion, the sincerity. Buble is devoid of all sincerity.  What sticks in my throat on this album is Sinatra's classic &quot;Summer Wind&quot; which is a story of lost love, yet Buble gives the impression of being on stage at Vegas, clicking his fingers, winking at the audience with a big white smile, and in the process, losing touch with the heart of the music. Bland, tasteless and lacking due respect.
B0000C9JFO|5.0|L'AUBERGE ESPAGNOLE is to films what 'Catcher in the Rye' is to books - a wonder-full romp through the coming of age of multinational youths who are simultaneously dissimilar and similar.  The inception of the film is artful with extraordinary camera effects, gradually introducing all the characters we will encounter by means of clever frames within frames and woven words with images.  The story is straightforward: Xavier is a bright Parisian boy (Romain Duris, who truly holds this film together), living with his hippie vegetarian mother, and under the influence of the 'adults' who counsel him to learn Spanish, get his MA in Barcelona, then return to Paris as an Economist versed in the Spanish  market (remember the 'Graduate' and plastics?).<br />With much anxiety over leaving his Paris, his  native language, and his girlfriend (the always lovely Audrey Tautou), he flies to Barcelona.  There he is befriended by a Neurologist (whose new wife is to become his paramour), and finally finds an apartment shared by 5 of the most refreshing youths ever gathered under one roof - German, Italian, British, Danish, Spanish, and now French.  It is the intermingling of these lives that is the joy of the story and we are witness to their foibles, idiosyncrasies, national traits, bonding, affairs, and finally their influence on the refreshed Xavier's world view.  After a year of social and intellectual and emotional learning, Xavier flies back to Paris to accept his &quot;new life&quot; as a boring economics executive, only to wake up and return to the city of joy - Barcelona, Spain.<br />Each of this large cast is excellent, drawing portraits of people we know so well by the end of the that WE could (or could wish to) have as roommates. The photography captures the beauty of Barcelona with lingering glimpses of Gaudi architecture, the ocean, and the vistas.  But it is in the end the wonder capturing of our youth (or dreams of same) that makes this movie so special.  Highly recommended!nded!
B00006RAKP|4.0|While Michael Jackson rather embarrasingly coined himself the &quot;King of Pop&quot;, said self-serving creation would better serve Sir Elton John if there truly were such a &quot;title&quot;. Although this collection does not get a perfect score from me, it is a very good representation of the masses of hits that Elton John had from 1970-2002. And I am sure that there are more to come.<br />This 2 CD set is well priced and there is a plethora of goodies to be found in the inserts. Some artists find it impossible to fit their hits into one CD, much less two. Elton could have easily gone for three CDs. Most of the great songs are here and they sound great. In a nutshell, this release is the one to buy if you are a casual Elton John fan.<br />Notwithstanding the fact the I believe that this is a great release, like many fans when it comes to artists they have followed, they find the faults even as they enjoy what is on the menu. For example, where is:<br />1) &quot;Funeral For A Friend&quot;/Love Lies Bleeding&quot;;<br />2) &quot;Harmony;<br />3) &quot;Border Song&quot;;<br />4) &quot;Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds&quot;;<br />5) &quot;Blue Eyes&quot;;<br />6) &quot;Mona Lisa and Mad Hatters&quot;<br />The list can go on and some may correctly point out that this is a 2 CD set and it should be representative of Elton's career as per the title. However, I could have done without the two selections from &quot;Songs From The West Coast&quot; as they sound out of place to me and although I think that the duet with Leann Rimes is nice, to ignore the aforementioned and many others makes me give this 4 stars instead of 5. Elton John the artist gets a 5, especially if you'd had the chance to see him in concert at almost anytime during his career.<br />Side bar: Although this does not affect my rating the set also includes an extra compact disc that does nothing for me so I just dicarded it. I wish that instead of &quot;Candle In The Wind (Live)&quot; and &quot;Don't Let The Sun Go Down on Me&quot; (With George Michael) and others, this extra CD would have gone into the catalogue to find loved songs that may not have been conventional hits. But this is a non-issue. Enjoy the set!n on Me&quot; (With George Michael) and others, this extra CD would have gone into the catalogue to find loved songs that may not have been conventional hits. But this is a non-issue. Enjoy the set!
B00005JMEW|4.0|Sometimes you just have ignore the reivewers and watch a movie for yourself. When Kill Bill came out some critics were hysterical in their denunciation of it. I walked into the theater expecting to see something that would send me fleeing back down the aisle, instead I saw a pretty good action flick. <br />Should you let your children see Kill Bill? No. I'm not even going to elaborate on why. Should you see it if you are phobic about male nurses? Probably not. Is it shocking? Only if you have never seen a Japanese or Hong Kong grindhouse movie before. Is Quentin Tarantino the most evil man in movies today? Oh please! Not by a long shot. <br />You already know the plot so I'll talk about what I really loved in this movie. Uma Thurman's character of The Bride is implacable. Her baby is gone, the young man she was to marry is dead and she will have revenge or die trying. I was reminded of the movie Hannie Caulder (from the 70s) or The Bride Wore Black(from the 50s? and The Bride With White Hair (80s). Female revenge movies are not new. This movie just raises the theme to glory.<br />The first fight with Vernita was fantastic and it also raised questions that hopefully will be answered in Kill Bill part II. Vernita is living in  a suburb, teaches Little League and has a nice, unaware husband.In other words, she appears to be retired and living a normal life so why was The Bride punished so harshly for apparantly wanted to do the same thing? I'm looking forward to finding out.  <br />The Oren Ishi back story is done in classic anime and is darn clever. The gorgeous--yes goregous final show down between her and The Bride is filmed in a snowy courtyard. Why it's snowing when it certainly wasn't even winter when the Bride arrives on the scene doesn't matter. The music and the way the scene is arranged is a direct homage to Sergio Leone and Once Upon a Time in the West. <br />A lot of people get killed in Kill Bill. Blood flows like water, limbs are lost and in the middle ofall this there are extremely funny jokes and sight gags.  If you hesistated to see this movie before don't worry and see it for yourself. It's no worse than any other grindhouse movie and is a good deal wittier than most of the movies of 2003. Have fun.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|...how would i describe the ac/dc live at donington dvd? well, the words 'holy f**k!' come to mind immediately. this is without a doubt the largest single congregation of humans i've ever seen. (remarkably, in the commentary supplement of the disc, angus says this wasn't the largest audience they've played to!) this show is all about big: angus is dwarfed by monstrous speaker cabinets the size of apartment buildings. the colours on display make you think spielberg - long shots of the stage look like the mothership from the conclusion of close encounters of the third kind. roaming helicopter shots capture the colossal scope of the concert (there's nothing more cool than overhead helicopter footage at a rock show, right?) if francis ford coppola was to direct a concert picture it would look like this. it all becomes even more gloriously majestic as the sun sets on donington park, leicestershire, bringing out the colours in vivid magnificence. mike fraser's audio mix is powerfully awesome, that's a guarantee, of course. you can feel the low end marhsall stack growl from angus' gibson sg bore into your chest like a jackhammer.<br />brian johnson commands the crowd with the authority of winston churchill, johnson the perfect foil to angus' grinning strip teases and exploding guitar solos. there is something purely satisfying in the way malcolm and angus deliver three chords, applying what i call their distinct 'youngian' technique: malcolm's concrete foundation dressed with angus' choice, succulent, frothing guitar licks. drummer chris slade and bassist cliff williams lay down the law that allows only ac/dc the ability to make a monster festival seem like an intimate club show.<br />if you're an ac/dc fan you are officially ordered to take a look at this dvd. i've seen the bad boys two or three times, but never like this. when historians look back on the history of rock, it will be finely, lovingly, ultra high energy, respectfully crafted documents like this show that will showcase the epitome of rock's evolution from its chuck berry genesis. ultimately, the most delightful surprise found within ac/dc's live at donington dvd is not the unending catalogue of rock gems, gems that we expect from ac/dc, but rather the blues jams performed in the breakdown sections of songs like jailbreak and high voltage. it's akin to finding hidden bonus material. what you discover in these pieces are brand new songs in themselves, killer instrumental works, seething with raw, emotional energy. what you discover in these pieces is hard rock heaven...
1869504917|3.0|I found this guidebook lacking. The pictures are tiny, it's weak on details and every other location mentioned seems to have the caveat &quot;closed to public&quot; tacked on. If you want to go to New Zealand, have a lovely time. If you are expecting to see actually places from the movie you'll be disappointed.
B0000033PB|5.0|I've been looking some negative reviews here on this site about this wonderful, magnific release. Well, all I can say is: this album are so damn good than the old material, just a little bit different from the others. It's an evolution state, every progressive band tends to change their sound after some years, but not all of them keeps their identity and the quality of their compositions like this three old guys! I mean, yes, some songs like Black Moon, Paper Blood, Burning Bridges and Better Days seems to be a kind of pop, but still good, I loved it all! The group didn't lose their identity as I told you, and it's very visible in wonderful compositions like Romeo And Juliet, Farewell To Arms and Changing States. Affairs Of The Heart is another beautiful song with the Greg Lake acoustic signature, and if you want some classes of feeling and technique on the piano, Close To Home is for you! So, don't waste your time and hurry up to get this fantastic release! I can put it together with Trilogy and Pictures At An Exhibition in the group's masterpiece gallery! C'EST LA VIE!
0312263120|4.0|It is interesting to see the &quot;All or Nothing&quot; reviews of virtually all of Dan Brown's work. But it seems that most of the &quot;one star&quot; reviewers somehow expected a science textbook rather than a novel. I'd guess they would go nuts reading DALE Brown and some of his &quot;type&quot; who write exiting stories with their own &quot;created&quot; science<BR>By the way, as a retired professor with 22 yrs. of college and two PhD's, who has been reading scientific fact and fiction since the 1940s, the only thing I ask of the author is for the &quot;science&quot; to be CONSISTANT in how it is used.<BR>LAST, I'D SAY THAT THE CRITIC WHO CAN'T SPELL URANIUM OR PLUTONIUM SHOULD GO BACK TO HIGH SCHOOL (WHERE NO ONE BUT THE TEACHER HAS ANY IDEA OF THE CONCEPTS OF NUCLEAR FISSION) AND TRY LOOKING FOR A STUDENT TO HELP. THEN FIGURE OUT HOW EINSTEIN CAUSED SO MANY BASEBALL BATS TO BREAK THESE DAYS.
