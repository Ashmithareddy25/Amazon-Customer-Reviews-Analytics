B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is addicting like a lot of FB games, but what I enjoy most is that a TON of my FB friends also play it and send me more lives.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game, have it on all of my devices!  It's one of the most addicting games I have tried yet.  A must have!
B00EP0KBXM|2.0|I was sure this movie would be incredible because I've never seen a bad movie from Will Smith.  The movie had some nice FX, but left me wanting more.  I suppose it adequately showed the transformation from boy to manhood, but lacked a solid story line.  I felt there were to many holes in the story and a bit obvious how things were heading.  Just one mans opinion!
B004LUS390|5.0|Its a dollar.  Today its free from amazon.  Dont listen to anyone saying its hard for a novice, this app is incredibly easy to use and extremely fluid, all it takes is a bit of clicking to figure out what the buttons do.
B00EB6F1TY|3.0|I was left a bit disappointed with this movie.  It started out pretty good and got, well, weird!  I found myself doing other things during the movie because it just didn't hold my attention.  I could stop multi tasking when the good parts came without losing much of the content.  The final battle was just a bit over dramatized, I thought.  To many iron men flying around.  It seemed his remote control units blew up awful easy, no wonder he didn't want to be in them!  The movie did have some of the typical &#34;Robert Downy&#34; humor, but it almost seemed like he was held back in this film.  I don't know, like I said, disappointing!
B001NLKZUA|4.0|You get hooked with the first book, City of Bones, and now you just have to see if Jace and Clare, get to be together.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|A mix of supernatural, sick minded writing and surprising directions await you in this series.  I typically don't rate each episode because of how episodes usually tie in one another to make the series.  I've watched each series and am now on the 3rd season.  I like both seasons 1 and 2, the acting has been top notch and they're using actors that play their parts well.  I like how each season is it's own and I like each season, so far.  Watch all of season 2, it's worth it!  Oh, and take my recommendation for season 3 as well!  It is awesome so far, I think it's called Coven.

B00D6DVSAE|2.0|Sting is not the Police, not rock, not jazz any more.  He is ethnic.  I saw him live at the city walk (Universal) and the show and material was great.  If this album is from a play, it should titled that way.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It was amazing for my daughter she loved it so much always asking can I play on the Kindle H.D
B0014J8D9Q|5.0|The whole cast was amazing in this movie! All time greatest &#34;western&#34; movie!!! Gene, Morgan and Clint did a great job on their roles and depicts how life was back then.
B00AW57L96|3.0|As a light holiday read it was fine.  A perfect family unravels as a deep secret is revealed.  A few twists in the plot were enough to keep me reading.  Light and unchallenging.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Love this book and like so many of King's books, I don't want to put it down.  Too bad I'm such a slow reader.  His way with words just keeps the flow going and he describes the 50s-60s almost to a tea.  If you're a King fan, make sure to put this one on your reading list.  Brings a new interest on a tragic time.
0061900656|5.0|I bought this as a gift for two little boys who are about to have a new baby sister. Their mom really liked the book and had listed it on her baby registry.  Her boys love trains and they were impressed that the kids in the story also have a toy train.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am addicted to this game, it's the best!!!! Thanks again for making it available for my Kindle. I can play anywhere! The game has enough challenge to make it fun , not frustrating.

B000H4TX9I|5.0|I don't know about you but he's amazing director and writer. From Buffy, Angel, Dollhouse, and the blockbuster Avengers I mean the range he has is amazing. But you have space you have cowboys what else can be better. The witty language, the meaningful story lines, it really made you love the characters. I wouldn't change anything but Fox decision to cancel the show.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|This is a great movie.  I love movies, so I watch lots of them.  This one blew me away.  By the way, don't be prejudiced against it because it stars a pretty-boy actor or you don't like other movies the director has made.  One of the movies this director previously made was so-so, and I didn't like the other one I saw.  But he knocked this one out of the park.  It is violent, but so is The Godfather, Silence of the Lambs, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, and Goodfellas.  The point?  If you avoid movie violence at all costs, you will miss some great movies.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|An awesome work of fiction. Suspense, star crossed lovers, magic, performance and imagination abounds... I would suggest to all readers.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|Made my fall in love with love again.  Not to mention my husband loved the after math :-)<br />A book that kept my snicking away to read \\"just one more page.\\"  Very good book!
B00BAVCD8A|1.0|This album should be titled save pop music like Maroon 5 instead, the title is an insult and disgrace to real rock music. If the title wasn't so pretentious I would have left it alone. I have nothing against pop music but People who listen to real rock and roll bands like led zeppelin, tool, Metallica, deftones, pink Floyd, nine inch nails, the clash, the misfits, jimi Hendrix, mastodon, radiohead, rancid, old weezer albums, rage against the machine,the doors, guns and roses, nirvana, soundgarden, and more will tell you this band is for all the young screamo pop kids. Fallout boy's music has no balls, no grittiness, lame vocals, over-produced, is poppy sounding, no rawness, lacks soul and energy, sounds like pre teen zit infested angst. Fallout boy is not even remotely close to being on the same level as rock.fallout boy does not fall in line with the evolution of rock. This music sounds horrible and weak and their sound and popularity is why rock is dead. The poppy weak vocal sounds so annoyingly horrible, it's hard to understand why anybody listens to this mess other than they are jr high and high school kids who have never really been exposed to real rock music. These kids need to reeducate themselves and pick up on real rock instead, they'll never go back to fallout boy guaranteed! If fallout boy is how people define rock music, rock is dead.
B00992CF6W|4.0|its so amazing even the older version with out the upgrade ....... it does cool thing and it freezes all the time but I still like it...
B00CL50LEC|4.0|This is a great hipster movie for hipsters..fans of movie like Juno, It's Kind of a Funny Story, Little Miss Sunshine, Up in the Air, Wes Anderson films, You Me and Everyone We Know, The Squid and the Whale, 500 Days of Summer, Garden State, June Bug, and more will absolutely love this film! This film is for the 20-30 something go green educated farmers market crowd. DIY, Obama, left wing indie artist....you get the point!! It's for these people!
B00000ING2|5.0|Directed with flare and style, this little scene and maybe underappreciated Coen Brothers film is a wonderful example of how a film's title can be misleading.  Most people (myself included) glance at the title and the movie poster and raise an eyebrow.  It just sounds and looks rather off-putting.  Despite names like Coen and Newman on the cover, the way the film was (and still is) marketed leaves a lot to be desired.<br /><br />The film is GREAT!<br /><br />`The Hudsucker Proxy' almost reminded me of the Coen Brothers take on a 1940's newspaper comedy (think `My Girl Friday' mixed with Coen Brothers humor and a dash of Woody Allen physical antics) and I was pretty much hooked from scene one.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Norville Barnes, a hapless young man looking for a job with zero experience but a lot of ambition.  He has ideas, but his ideas are met with sketisism.  That is, until he seeks employment with Hudsucker Industries the very same day the president and owner of the company commits suicide.  Left in a bind, Sidney Mussburger, who is somewhat left in charge after the loss of his boss, makes an executive decision.  In order to sway the masses away from buying stock in the company, so that Mussburger and his cronies can own the company entirely, he hires Barnes, who he deems an idiot, and places him in position of President of the company.<br /><br />His plan backfires.<br /><br />Throw in a sassy journalist determined to expose Barnes for a moron and a guardian angel in the form of a mysterious employee/narrator and you have an engaging film that has style, substance and moments of pure hilarity.<br /><br />Robbins is aces here, delivering a brilliantly comedic performance that contains the right amount of `black comedy' needed to sell every scene.  Working with Robert Altman paid off for him.  Newman is steady evil, and Charles Durning has a brilliant cameo as the dead Waring Hudsucker.  I honestly can't decide if Jennifer Jason Leigh is the film's weakest link or the reason I love the movie so much.  She is so abrasive, like a complete caricature (although many of the characters feel like they are ripped from a comic strip) and yet that is either a delight or a detractor; but I honestly can't decide which.  She made me cringe and she made me smile, a lot of times in the same moment.<br /><br />Regardless, the film is wonderful and needs to be seen!lm's weakest link or the reason I love the movie so much.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I highly recommend The Husbands Secret if you enjoy reading as a way to experience life from another persons perspective. Although very sad at times, I really liked this book and found the characters to be very real (aka: flawed) and Ms. Moriarty did a magnificent job expressing each characters emotions. I felt what they felt and asked myself multiple times while reading The Husbands Secret &#34;what would I do if that happened to me&#34;? This is this first book by Ms. Moriarty that I have read and I have already downloaded two more!
0452273331|5.0|I initially wanted to read Atlas Shrugged but after reading that the Fountainhead was essentially the prelude I decided to read it first. I'm very glad I did. There is no fiction in this book, every situation, ideology, behavior and analysis in the book is existent in the world today. It is said that the path to hell is paved with good intentions, Rand analyzes collectivism so profoundly and from so many angles and shows how even though collectivism is very appealing it is nothing but a seductive ideology whose goal, conscious or unconscious, is to obtain power over others. Some psychopaths in the world seek this power and they know how to get it, the appeal to people's sentiments, drives and they really understand how to manipulate people. Those who have had this kind of power had a hatred and a parasitic attachment for human beings, they wanted people to do as they do, they had an internal chaos and so they wanted the world to be in such chaos, because they felt good in it. On the other hand you've got people who are selfish, not in the perverted sense but in the libertarian sense, people who do not wish of controlling others or telling others what they should do, they live for themselves for their work and these people very often tend to have great potentials and achieve greatness and are happy by this. These people fulfill their own nature, they don't fulfill what others would like them to, but what their selves desire to.  Rand is a great writer with a great philosophy, it is not just individualism, it is something more profound. You will find out for yourself as you read this great novel. The best part of the book is that Rand gives us all these different ideologies and analyses through the characters in the book.  She shows us the psychopathic, hater and control freak who preaches collectivism/socialism and whose purpose is to have ultimate power through Ellsworth Toohey. The individualist, that cares about his work, and fulfilling his aspirations, his love,his nature through architecture and who has no interest in running people's lives, avenging anybody or seeking power through Howard Roark.  The language is plain English not like some writers who could express their ideas easily but make it more complicated than it should be (ex. Hegel). The book is extremely long, but it is simple to read and definitely not boring, I read it in like two weeks. It is definitely one of my favorite novels, and I definitely recommend it. This book will definitely make you question and dismiss things you've taken for granted. Go Ahead and Buy it, it's a good investment!!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|This book has nothing to do with making love. And. It poorly written. It sucks. I have nothing worthwhile to add. I was an idiot... I bought all three. It didn't get any better. &#34;I smirked.&#34; And, I do.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Before it didn't have notifications on the kindle screen, now it does an I love it. But I wish it was faster

B005LAIIHG|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when we started watching this movie. Everything about this movie is first class - the story, the acting, the videography. The best movie I've ever seen - and the end of the story leaves you wondering - what if...
B0083DJWGO|5.0|difficult to read, hard to listen to. Many rabbit trails, asides and recursions. Nonetheless, I loved the point of view and the &#34;lessons&#34;. the upshot, &#34;bs if fragile, truth is antifragile&#34;.
0920668372|5.0|Written very well, even my 7 month old likes it! Definitely recommend for mothers even fathers to read. Two thumbs up.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was able to watch the whole season within a week end.  I couldn't stop watching.  Can't wait until next season.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Great story. You will enjoy.<br />Fast moving. You can not put it down.<br />You will not regret reading this one.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is the way a story should be told. The book is written in the time line after \\"A Time to Kill\\". The characters are all a part of the story and some are from the book aforementioned.<br /><br />The book is so good because it reaches into the soul of the normal reader. Yes, Jake is Jake, and he is still broke, still fighting for the down trodden and still trying to pay his bills and is still behind on his rent.<br /><br />It gets to be humorous when unsavory characters (buzzards) enter the picture when a court battle looms and money is involved. Did I say this book is about a legal battle.<br /><br />I wish JG would continue just to write books about Jake.<br /><br />I will not reveal the story line but you must read it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Obsessive compulsive and fun. A must have! can play for hours and hours. Join in for all the challenges. Join in for various levels.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Paul chose some great classics. They happened to be tunes that held poignant memories for my Dad, and we have enjoyed sharing this music that was so beautifully produced.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I would rate this as a 5, because there is nothing about this show that I don't like. The clothes, the house, the suspense, the love relationships, etc. all have me enthralled!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I started this series many years ago and finally have finished. Though Robert Jordan passed before the book could be finished, he man who took over for him did a wonderful job. It ending was better than I could have dreamt myself.

Words are not enough to describe this book!!!!! i love it!!!:)
B000OVLINI|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read, and I read a lot!  Superb writing mixed with a wonderful story.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I so love this app. I've been using this app for about 4 years. Looked at others, but I am sold out on this one. I live by a calendar. And whether, I'm filing, organizing, whatever, I do in a way that the eye can find what I'm looking for quickly and comfortablly. This is through coloring coding my information. And this calendar allows you to color code and customize everything. With a little creativity, I am able to log everything....calls to make, errands to run, appts., addresses, phone numbers, tasks, etc. But what I mainly use it for, is to track health, behavior, and actions, incidences, anything that takes place with my dad. He lives in a nursing home. So when I see him, I note how his day went, what happened. I do the same with meetings. And anything having to do with my dad is always colored yellow, easy for my eye to locate. I can't say enough about this app! You can set an alarm to alert you of a &#34;to do&#34; not just an appt.
1405911662|4.0|Good story and well written.  Characters were a little boring but it fits well with the story.  I would recommend this book to my friends and family.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|The evidence is overwhelming. Global warming deniers are full of hot air.  We must stop using carbon as an energy source.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|To be honest, I am not good at this game. But I think for the one who is willing to be more clever, this one is interesting.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I was excited at the fact that the third book was coming out and I so wanted to read the ending of this trilogy.<br /><br />I was not expecting this type of ending for the Divergent trilogy, but I truly enjoyed it!! Veronica really show cased alot of her main characters, strengths and compassion for each other.<br /><br />This book, this trilogy was a great read and page turner!! I kept wanting more and more.......

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I LOVE this game. Candy Crush Saga is so addictive. I have a  hard time putting it down once I start playing the game. Not only is it a lot of fun to play but this game can be every irritating after getting hung up on several different levels through out the game.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|Neatly closes out the entire series. The last 5 chapters will blow you away. This is a must buy for anyone that likes fantasy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved every part of this book one of my favs of all time. Love re-reading it all the time
B00EDLP6O2|5.0|Great real feel boxing simulation game. The best so far for this tablet! I feel Rocky where's my movie soundtrack?
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|If Wayne Dyer were a capitalist this would be his manifesto. I've recommended this book at least 20 times before I was even halfway through it!
B00ANA27IU|4.0|Like many others, I saw the movie first (during its first run). The book explains so much that I didn't understand, and the effect of mutual reinforcement was fantastic. In addition, Arthur C. Clarke writes well, and his projection (though dated) of life in the 21st is remarkably accurate, while his depiction of early hominids was utterly fascinating. Finally, the book is a quick read making it an enjoyable experience. A great book all around.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|There are a few glitches hopefully it will get straighten out . When sending request for tickets to people who play it on ipad they get the request for the ticket when they send it to you on your kindle or computer i dont get it so i sit and wait for some else to send who does not have an ipad . Evrything else goes fine
B0007ZD6YK|5.0|Why, oh why, does all the good stuff come from Britain, especially BBC?  Acting, editing, direction, script are all exceptional.<br /><br />I prefer buying BBC series, like this one, region 2, and streaming it from my computer to the TV.  (Acorn edits too much stuff out!)
B0015DWJ8W|4.0|As a marathonner, I am quite familiar with the challenges he met and the ideas he got. I just don't have the talent to put it into words. He said much more than what i experienced. Running is an attitude. Very delightful to read it.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I haven't used it much yet, but I really love what I've used it for! I also purchased a keyboard for my Kindle,so I can really create new documents without taking my laptop everywhere!

B001E8WNNO|5.0|Let's face it, the review you ALL want to read about is the car! Christine is truly and example of American mechanical ingenuity .  And the 1958 Plymouth Fury has it ALL!  I dare you to find those options in a top end 2014 BMW 7 series.  I dare you to take any other car, ram in into another car and then watch your car put itself back together.  Now THAT'S a high end option.<br /><br />Oh, and people you don't like?  Check out Mopar's Kill-A-Jerk feature!  It hunts down people you don't like and takes care of them.  That's right gang.  Everyone you know will respect you as you drive around in your Plymouth Fury.  I mean they have to respect you....really they do.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is one of the best games I have ever played in my life it is sooooooooo fun! and you can even get usian Bolt!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I like a happy ending as much as anyone but the journey to get there was pretty steamy and entertaining.  Mr. Grey's transformation while still maintaining his intriguing tastes over the three books is craftily done.  Will there be more?  Hope so.
B008OM0M4U|5.0|I'm not joking, I'm seriously offended I laughed, I can't help it, I'm snickering the whole time, I feel terrible.  My eyes go wide at some moments and practically busting a gut laughing at the same time, I feel really bad about it, I'm going to you know where...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Don't be fooled by imitations; there is no substitute for the real Candy Crush Saga. I'm so glad this is on Kindle Fire now. It seems like I waited forever.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|If you want to read about a tragic murder of a teenager and the horrible case of finding the murderer to be another teen. RIde the emotional roller coaster of the family whose son is suspected. And then a conclusion that involves two more murders.  The ending was really rushed and did not tie into the long drawn out details of the rest of the book.
B003UD7JEE|5.0|I have watched only part of &#34;Nikita&#34; but have been amazed at the profound truths it touches upon. Back in 1958, I was drafted into the US Army & after being tested was recruited into their Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC). During those years I was was an atheist, but even though I did not believe in God or &#34;good & evil&#34; I was nevertheless appalled at the amorality of the CIC. The perfect recruit would be someone who was completely dead to all  of God's image that is in man - caring, compassion, love, sensitivity to what is truly &#34;right&#34; & &#34;wrong,&#34; righteousness, integrity, etc. I think of those I have seen on TV convicted of murder who are without any remorse at all - calmly discussing the heinous murders they have committed without a tinge of sorrow or sadness or pain of memory. Christians are called upon to &#34;die&#34; to all that is not of God in their lives. Those who participate in the &#34;Division&#34; in &#34;Nikita&#34; are urged to die to all that is of God's image in their lives. Nikita herself cannot do so & so becomes a &#34;rogue&#34; - just as Christians are called upon by their God to become an &#34;alien&#34; in this world. Tears of sorrow have come to my eyes as I have contemplated how mankind has perverted the image of Himself that God placed in us - & how we have turned from our true God-given destiny.
B00CWX1HPA|5.0|Well I just watched this with all four 18 inch folded horns and the loungchair butt-kicker firing and actually got Sensurround in Battlestar Galactica for the first time since 1978 at the cinema!  That was pretty intense.  Simply astounding compared to the previous (terrible) DVD release and the picture is much better too. Just superb.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|This Game is fun. I like this game keeps me entertained. Good to pass a little time. Winning gets the monkey better costumes and power ups.
B0036S4B6M|1.0|Do not consider this book if you are a victim of crime. I mean a true victim of crime not just an imagined victim. I could not empathize with the main character or other prisoners. It was not for me at all.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|Truly enjoyed the final season of Spartacus. Liam M. was great as the leader of men and women and the progression to the conclusion was inspiring, sexy, violent and bloody yet also dramatic, sad and much lamented. Here is hoping we get more edgy adult series from the producers of SPARTACUS!

B004661J04|4.0|Have seen this movie several times and would watch it again. Great suspense and makes you keep thinking through out.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book had SO much to love! A wonderful love story! A very intense roller coaster ride of love. Travis is a very lovable, dumb MMA fighter who keeps making stupid mistakes and Abby loves him but may not be able to take his continued mistakes and keep herself sane. I love that Travis nicknamed Abby Pigeon, that makes you love him even more! Their relationship seems so real, this story makes you want a happy ending for them! The other characters that make up their ring of friends and family grow quickly into the story really well also. A another story that you hate to see end. Loved it!!
B00F88U4J6|5.0|Reading books are made easier with Moon+ Reader. I took a little bit to remember how to get the books I downloaded, but after you get it figured out it's pretty easy to use.
B00005QAPH|3.0|its like a woody allen movie, but everyone looks like a model and there arent any jokes. watch La Strada or Amarcord.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This TV series is the best.  I can hardly wait for Season Four to begin.  I'm looking forward to learning how Lady Mary will overcome her tragedy.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is great. It does what it's supposed to do and more. Numbers are easy to read and the calculator is simple to use. I give it 5 stars!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Awesome thrill ride on an emotional roller coaster. I couldn't put it down. I was angered, saddened, intrigued, informed... the list goes on!
B000RZIGVS|5.0|Disc 7 of Season 1 - &#34;The Beginning&#34; won't play correctly no matter what I do. Now making my way thru Season 2 discs. So far, they're OK.
0761172726|5.0|This is the fourth time I am buying Sandra boynton's calendar.  During the last five years, there was only one year that I didn't get this calendar.  I wanted to try something different and I realized quickly that it was a big mistake.  After making that mistake, I decided that I would just stick with this calendar every year.  I am so glad this calendar works for me and my family.  Mom is the first column and four others are blank.  I put &#34;dad&#34; &#34;daughter&#34; &#34;son&#34; &#34;family&#34; in other four column.  This calendar is easy to keep track of everyone's schedule.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Great exercise video.  Each level gets increasingly more difficult, but you can mix it up and just not do it like its meant to be done. That is how I like to do it for variety.  It's great and I only really do it on my days off of work.  If this 57 year old body can do it , so can you !
B000W061HE|1.0|This is very poor quality mp3 and I will delete it and will buy the CD to rip it myself . you have been warned
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|It is a great start to a new series. The book has you on edge from the moment you start and you won't be able to put it down.<br />Great mix of adventure, love and friendship.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this  game is a really big addiction . Its like a minion virsion of temple run Wichita makes it a lot more fun.  Get it!
B003Z0BWR2|5.0|We were all wondering what would happen after the revelations in the first book and we were not dissappointed. Another great mix of adventure, love and friendship. Can't wait to read what happens next to Clary and Jace.
B001JIHGO0|4.0|Awesome movie especially for Halloween! Would really recommend it!<br />Only goofy parts are when kate beckon sale talks but other than that it's awesome
B00DH4BL8Q|5.0|Loving the films, I started reading the books because I wanted to see how the story ends. It is an amazing series which takes you on a yourney through myths. On top of that it is a story about growing up, about right and wrong. I would recommend it to anyone.
B000I186FW|4.0|This movie was much better than I thought that it would be. I have passed up this movie many times. My mistake.
B003Z0BWT0|5.0|Great mix of adventure, love and friendship. This is the third book and answers all the questions we've had since the first one. Are Clary and Jace really brother and sister or was it just a lie to throw them off balance, so they won't be able to stop the war that is coming? Great conclusion.
B00F57VFXO|5.0|Five Stars!!! His name is Steveson, Damian Steveson and his book The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Parsifal is a killer thriller. It is a heart racing, blood pumping thriller about the life of the man who wrote about the man. Man! What man? Why I’m talking about Bond, James Bond. This novel is just as intense as any James Bond Thriller and even more so because it is about the man who created Bond. Flemings life was just as exciting as his alter ego 007. Steveson captures it in a free flowing style that has you jumping and turning, twisting and moving. Never sure what is going to happen next but always knowing that something is about to happen. From the opening page until the last, every step on the way you take an emotional roller coaster on this government agent cheering him on the way whether is escaping launched rockets or Nazi spies, Flemings like Bond maintains his cool under pressure. Not only figuring a way out of his predicament but also thinking of his next appointment or move for the day. How’s that for confidence. Well trained and intelligent, Fleming comes off as a real human being with flaws and weaknesses. This is an excellent and exciting book. I recommend it highly.
B000VWJ6D4|5.0|Wore out my first one, so had to replace it.<br />Elton John has always been one of my favorite artists and he still is.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Wow. I didn't want it to end. I am blown away in this book. What I thought would happen didn't. I cried through out this book. Tobias (Four) and Beatrice (Tris) have a lot to go through of trust and not trust. Can't believe it is over. What a great series and book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Truly amazing..really speaks to you..hooked me demonstrate to finish and never disappointed me..John green wrote a fantastic novel I will fir sure share with everyone
B00G32VYDG|3.0|Different take on a movie, a bit slow in some parts, but over all entertaining.  A mix between men in black and goastbusters
B008NW67E0|5.0|Purchased this when it came out and listened to the entire album on repeat for several weeks.  Definitely 5-stars.  I've been a fan since their first album and will continue to purchase everything Mumford and Sons produces.
B000M2O6AQ|5.0|Exciting adventure in the Amazon.Good characterization, good plot.  If you like the Bourne movies, or other Matt Damon flicks, you'll like this.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Zealot contains an extraordinary wealth of highly enlightening information based on real scholarship. The book is exceptionally well written and truly fascinating. I find the author's conclusions about the kind of individual Jesus must have been and the reasons the Gospels were written as they were overwhelmingly persuasive. The fact this picture turns upside down so much of what conventional religion has taught makes the book a real stunner. For this reason, I believe over time the impact of Zealot will be profound. Some have noted that the rich historical picture (which is jaw-droppingly bloody and violent) painted by Aslan contains &#34;nothing new&#34; and that specialized scholars and historians are quite familiar with these facts. No doubt that's true - but laymen have no knowledge or conception of these details and no one has woven them together into a powerful page-turner like this. If you are determined to hold onto conventional Christian stereotypes about the life and times of Jesus, and the character and actions of Jesus as a man, and the viewpoints set forth in the Gospels, then don't read this gripping, engrossing book. – Scott DeGarmo
B009K6DKTS|5.0|A Great book, that introduces a new way of thinking about risk and life in general.  Recomended for everyone that wants to learn about the perils of rational hubris when trying to understand and control risk and life.
B003730LRY|4.0|Good family movie. Oldie but goodie. My daughter really enjoyed Wednesdays role and she's gonna be her for Halloween.  recommended
B001N3GUIE|5.0|It's an old movie that I remember when I was younger,it's a classic.Have not looked at this copy yet but it should be nice in blue-ray
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Enjoyed this book, wanted the story to continue. What will Four choose for his final chapter, hoping he finally will find peace.
B00ESY77LO|3.0|Enjoyed the cinematography and modern musical twist to the roaring twenties. I never particularly liked the book or story anyway.  Characters were believable and well acted.  Also the sound was funky until I went away from surround to stereo and removed any effects.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Jane Eyre is one of my favorite stories and I've seen most of the movie versions.  This one is without a doubt, THE BEST ever.  The others fade in comparison.
0767811070|5.0|Never saw it when it was new. It still packs an emotional wallop, especially if you live in the city.
B00FHAB3HW|1.0|Miley Cyrus has officially proven herself to be a horrendous influence on young girls in every sense of the word. It is at this point that the very fact that she even has a record deal is nothing short of criminal. What she did at the MTV awards made me want to puke! She is not even a real musician to begin with. Instead, she is nothing more than a gimmick marketing tool being used by the demons at her record company to encourage young girls to be sluts and young boys to be classless pigs.<br /><br />I really hoped that she would have taken Sinead O'Connor's advice, but just the fact that she chooses not to listen to such words of wisdom proves how far she has fallen in terms of moral character. She is a piece of trash and a waste of time, and I really wish that she would just go away and take her horrible, overrated \\"music\\" with her! Also, I do not say this out of bias. I might not be a pop fan in any sense of the word, but I can say, with enough knowledge, that Miley cannot be compared to people like Christina Aguilera or Pink - and I am not even a fan of either of them! You don't have to be a fan of a certain genre to be able to tell the stains from the gems.<br /><br />To Miley Fans: Sorry, but I am a REAL man who does not look at women as mere objects. I value them for who they are as people, their personalities, moral character, and most of all - CLASS! It is trash like Miley and others who fuel the urge within young males to be classless pigs. Most of all, contrary to what you might think, I DO have a very productive life, with a college degree and an average white-collar job, and this review took me no longer than 15 minutes to do. So, if you want to think that I am a miserable low-life... THINK AGAIN! Thank you, and have a nice day.
B004LUS390|5.0|I like to color draw so you have to  get this game if you like to sketch or draw so get it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|super fun. very challenging. love I can see friends playing and stats. seems real easy but kinds stuck and have to wait if it takes too long to pass levels.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|The game is great but I was about to start a race and out of nowhere it went back to my home screen
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This is one amazing documentary! It may be the greatest rock film ever made. So much of it is inspiring, humbling, uplifting and so much more. A person who cannot find joy in this film is basically soulless. The way it is shot and edited is also very well crafted. Everything about this film is so full of life. The pacing is done well, the colors are beautiful, the length is perfect. Everyone should see it!
B000006RHK|5.0|A must have maiden album! I would suggest to buy the original capitol/EMI discs than the remastered ones, but maybe that's just me, if you enjoy louder album, then the remaster will be good enough
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game can be played without spending money, but it's so fun that it's hard to wait for time to reload.There are a few glitches though. It seems that your extras may be tied to the in game timer so if you reload your timer, you lose time on your extras.
B00A8MGLAI|1.0|This is perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen more than I should.<br /><br />The only thing worse than Tom Hanks is a half-dozen Tom Hanks characters in the same bad movie.<br /><br />What were they thinking?
B002BU0DPE|1.0|Just like every single Turtle Beach headset I ever bought, this one just stopped working after a couple of months. Sure, while it was working the sound quality was very good, but thats not the point. Dont waste your money or your time on this company. Spend the little bit of extra money and get a really good headset, and not this crap. This is the third time its happened to me and I can tell you right now, Im definitely not buying another one any time soon
B008J34466|5.0|Great album (as you probably already know by now).  The songs that have yet to be released are a bit edgy (read R-rated language) but have beats that are great for a workout!
B003VANOFY|3.0|First pair died, Logitech did right by me and replaced them without much fuss. But second set seems to drain it's battery very rapidly I normally only get about a hour of life out of them. BUT even with all that I love them they fir great sound isn't half bad and my squad mates can understand me as well as I can understand them when we are working together. Final note, I would go for the hard wired ones instead of the wireless imo.
B00BI73CVI|1.0|Having loved the plot line and characters in the book and all the media blitz, I was very excited to see the movie! Casting was horrific from top to bottom-don't know what film maker was thinking. The only thing worse was the musical capabilities of the cast. After enduring all that my husband and I could stand, we fast forwarded, fast forwarded, fast forwarded to the closing scene. Gave the movie to a thrift shop the next day. Very disappointed.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|A beautiful story about a man who has every right to be bitter and angry, but isn't. Definitely a &#34;feel-good&#34; documentary.  WATCH IT!!!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Allegiant is unsettling. But it's unsettling for the characters in the book and the author has done a masterful job of creating that same sense in the reader. I did enjoy the book, but I found the dueling points of view to be somewhat distracting. Not that I didn't appreciate hearing from both Tris and Tobias, but I didn't think it was as well done as some other books I've read.<br /><br />I only gave it two out of five stars because I felt like some things were done for the wrong reasons. That the author was trying to shock and awe and that the same things could have been accomplished in a different way that doesn't leave the reader feeling quite so exhausted.<br /><br />I feel like the ending was contrived to suit a purpose that had nothing to do with the plot, but rather to show that the author was \\"brave\\" or \\"daring.\\" And that's unfortunate because reading through all of these comments, I can see that she has alienated her fan base, which I'm sure she will come to regret.<br /><br />The one thing I've learned in my own writing is that you need to understand your audience. Her audience is primarily teens and young adults. While many mature readers might see the artistic beauty in this ending (I'm not one of them), her primary audience likely will be incredibly disturbed by it.<br /><br />I finished reading it last night, but my 13-year old daughter is only on chapter 32. I am really concerned about her reaction. I have a feeling she will react the way many readers here have and will not want to even see the movie. Which is too bad, because she's had the date circled on the calendar for months.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting on this to be available for so long!!!! Love this game!!  So happy I can play on my Kindle!!
B006M4F67A|5.0|It's fun, tiles are great, works well. Also has a variety of layouts to make it interesting and challenging. Great product!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|The revival of Doctor Who, starring the amazing Christopher, alongside Piper. Many amazing episodes full of suspense, comedy, and even horror. I don't know if there's a better TV series out there in all of time and space.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Nothing special ! Poor image quality..<br />Apple TV works better, better image .<br />Can only see You tube, netflix and Google play ...<br />Not worthy for me .
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Cannot wait for the next season!  With how the season left off, so excited to see where it takes us!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I think that this game is fanominal and is good for children and adults looking for fun. I also like the graphics.
B000F8O35U|4.0|I love The Little Mermaid!!  It's such a great movie.  It's one I can turn on time and time again and not get tired of.  I only gave it 4 stars though because I'm pretty sure my copy I purchased from Amazon isn't a legit copy.  The printing on the DVD is a little sketchy and too saturated looking.  However, the disk plays fine.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game ice age is one of my fav little kids game it is so addictive because there's soo many levels that you have to bet and there's new things you unlock and the animlas look just like they do in the movie cause they are soo adorible
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Brandon Sanderson knows how to suck you into a story and keep you there until the end! I have read every book he has written and this one was every bit as good as what I have to come to expect from him!!
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Yes, I am a fan of Breaking Bad, however, there are major flaws in the story that just have to be addressed. Here are a few:<br /><br />l. Walt Jr. is far too cooperative for a 16 year old boy. When asked to do chores, he always says, &#34;Sure, Mom!&#34; like he is soooo happy. Most 16 year olds are sassy, self-centered, sleep all day-up all night, talk back, spend 99% of time with friends, NEVER do housework, and snap back at parents who ask them to do it. His grades would tank, too, if his dad was as much trouble as Walt Senior.<br /><br />2. Jesse's teeth are too perfect. A heavy meth user's teeth ground away with the constant use and gums are red, bloody, soft. Other users on the show have bad teeth, but not Jesse. NOT believable.<br /><br />3. There is hardly any mention of DNA. At all murder scenes in which Walt just walks away, his DNA would be everywhere. BOTH their DNA and fingerprints were all over Uncle Tio's house-case over.<br /><br />4. At Tio's when Tuco throws Jesse and Walt's phones into the back yard, police would have found them, found their fingerprints and case over. When there is a death like Tuco’s, law enforcement workers search miles around the crime scene.<br /><br />5. Jesse is not that attractive that super hot chicks would be after him. The actresses chosen to play his love interests are way too pretty for a guy who is a big loser. They are also too tall and too big for him. He seems overpowered by them.<br /><br />6. The theft of lab equipment would have been noticed. Other teachers would have complained that things were missing. Schools keep up with stuff better than that. Each teacher uses the equipment, so someone would have noticed. There is always a bitchy woman/man  on the staff who keeps up with stuff right down to pencils and erasers. Gilligan shows that he is writing about how he thinks it goes in schools, not how it truly works.<br /><br />7. No one ever seems to be looking out a window to see murders and kidnappings. Justnot realistic.<br /><br />8. Mike would have immediately killed Walt when Walt killed Gus. Mike would know he had to get to Walt before Walt got to him.<br /><br />9. Killing 9 in prisons? Come on!! Prisons have cameras everywhere. Someone would have seen something. NOT believable.<br /><br />10. Hank would have not only driven by the laundry once, he would have been driving by several times and he would have seen Walt's car. We cannot believe that a skilled detective would rely on one person to drive him by that place only one time. He would have driven by at all hours of the day and night, and sent others to do the same.<br /><br />11. Walt would have spent his money all along for basic household needs. They were barely getting by, so he would have been buying groceries, new shoes for Walt, Jr., baby clothes, gas, etc. He would have always had a pocket full of cash, to make Skyler's life smoother. She would have liked that and he could have eased her along better.<br /><br />12. Why did Walt make a pass at the principal? Does not make sense for him logically. We are to believe he does all things out of logic. This would only harm him.<br /><br />13. We are told over and over how he does this for his family. All right-----we get it. You do not have to remind us....enough already.<br /><br />14. Jesse throwing money away would not happen. He would be doing his best to show that he is a winner to his parents. He would have been buying things for his parents, sending his mom flowers on all occasions, and spending the cash on the girlfriends for diamonds, clothes, etc.<br /><br />15. Jesse would not drive a beat up car. He would have a Lexus or Mercedes. All drug dealers drive the best cars in town. The local car dealers rely on them to spend their cash and everyone turns a blind eye.<br /><br />16. Someone with the DEA would be on Walt and Jesse's side. The money is just too much of a temptation. They could have paid off their own informant. The DEA agents would havenoticed one of their own acting suspiciously.<br /><br />17. Jesse and Walt's DNA would be in the UHaul Truck that did the magnet thing. DNA does not go anywhere. Also, the magnets would get traced back to the junk yard and case closed.<br /><br />18. All junk yards have to give account for cars that are smashed. Even though they got rid of the RV, there would be enough left for DNA, even fingerprints. Case closed at that point.<br /><br />19. Someone would notice that Walt was visiting Jesse in the hospital. Case closed. All hospitals film everyone coming and going because of having narcotics present in the facilities.<br /><br />20. The mask found in the desert would have had fingerprints or DNA from Walt. Case closed. It did lead them back to the school. DEA would have put in cameras and found Walt stealing more property. Most schools have cameras inside anyway. Case closed.<br /><br />21. Once Walt gets all that money, women would be after him.<br /><br />22. There are not enough female characters in this show. Women are always around where money is being made. Walt would have been tempted with plenty of 15 to 20 year olds. Hot chicks can sniff out cash.<br /><br />23. Walt would have been using cough drops with all that coughing.<br /><br />24. There is a mouth wash that cancer doctors prescribe for lung patients because of the dry mouth and odors. Walt would constantly be using mouthwash and cough drops.<br /><br />25. NO one with lung disease can run up and down steps. He would be on oxygen therapy with the air tanks needed at all times. Uncle Tio has them and he is sitting. Walt would not be that active with real lung cancer. Lungs determine all movement of the body. He would not be able to move like he does. Even driving a car is difficult with lung cancer and chemo.<br /><br />26. Nothing is said about the raids on Gus's delivery trucks. Law enforcement would have been involved, this would lead to Gus; case over.<br /><br />27. Ted would not be all goo gooover a 40 year old pregnant woman. He would have a long line of 20 year olds in his bed.<br /><br />28. Once Skyler found problems with Ted's books, he would have fired her. Men do not like bad news.<br /><br />29. They can pay $800,000 cash for a car wash????? How is that money laundering????<br /><br />30. Walt would have been traveling to the Cayman islands or other sites that will launder money for him. He could afford to hire a private plane.<br /><br />31. Walt would have an alternate plan of escape. With 80 million he would have many options.<br /><br />32. He would have been sending the family on long vacations, as in Europe or Australia. People with new money travel. He would keep them out of town and out of his way and out of harm.<br /><br />33. Most people who live in the West do speak Spanish. A person with Walt's intelligence would pick it up easily.<br /><br />34. Walt would buy diamonds and expensive shoes for Skyler. Woman can be bought off. Logically, he would appeal to her ego. As Ron White says, &#34;Diamonds, that will shut her up.&#34;<br /><br />35. The baby does not seem to grow very fast. Most children will not fit into a bassinet at age 6 to 9 months. Is that a real baby? Looks fake. Why is it always wearing a hat in New Mexico with heat in the 100's to 110's?<br /><br />36. Skyler would have followed Walt to the laundry. case closed.<br /><br />37. Friends of Crazy 8 would have gone to see Jesse as he was last seen with him.<br /><br />38. The police are portrayed as bumbling fools. Not so. They are generally very thorough. Not believable that no police officer can put two and two together.<br /><br />39. There would have been a police report filed when Walt crashed the new car he bought for Walt Junior. No one gets away with that kind of damage without someone noticing. case closed<br /><br />40. Hank has plenty of chances to bug Walt's home or car. He would have done so in order to find out the truth, then, he could have built his case.<br /><br />41. Gus's operation was way to big for him to rely on one person to cook. He would have had cooks all over the place. He could have set up labs in his trucks. He was too smart to put all his eggs in one basket.<br /><br />42. Tio would not pee in a pool in front of the Don--never happen. Pee on flowers or people, but not the pool where gals are gonna be swimming.<br /><br />43. Walt Jr. never changes. A kid at age 16 changes in many ways. His hair style is not modern. His clothes are like circa 1995.<br /><br />44. Jesse's shirts never get dirty. The white stays the whitest. He sleeps in clothes, but they do not wrinkle or even look dirty. Not believable.<br /><br />45. Too many bullets fly in the shooting scenes. My brothers both use automatic weapons and I know plenty of law enforcement officials who tell me that when the bullets fly from an automatic rifle, someone dies. Oh, Hank falls to the ground as his defense against automatic weapon fire. Hank would be dead. He would have been hit with many bullets and his head would explode like a watermelon bursting open.<br /><br />46. Too many dead bodies and no one seems to be missing them. Too many ways both Walt and Jesse would have been seen with the ones they killed. All cities have cameras on the streets. All major roads have &#34;eye in the sky&#34; cameras. When people die, relatives know who the last person is that was with them.<br /><br />47. All in all, too many things just are not believable. Police are not that bad at their jobs and criminals are not that lucky.<br /><br />48. Yes, I know I will get those letters from die hard fans, but get real--DNA would have sunk them after the first murder.<br /><br />49. Good fantasy, but not good realism.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's  super cool. I can't stop playing it!! I am ten and it is perfect for me. I love it.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Best show ever existed. The show is amazing and keeps getting better and better each year. Hands down awesome amazing
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|I loved all the songs with the exception of the one with Courtney Love in it.... ew. All the other songs were great!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book.  I read mostly when I am on the treadmill and I was anxious to get on the treadmill so I could read another chapter in the book.  I did not want to finish the book.  It was like I had became friends with the people in the book.  Now I am reading another book and do not enjoy it nearly as much and do not look forward to my treadmill walk.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|There are three different disks, each one different than the other but they all make sense. His voice is amazing and I can't wait to hear what he puts out next!
0307352153|5.0|When I read this book I felt an immense amount of guilt over being considered &#34;antisocial&#34; because I never like being around large groups of strangers at parties or conferences.  I felt that the book was very empowering and have given it as a gift to several family members who are definite introverts, as well as recommending it to some friends.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|A very helpful app. This version is actually much better then the pervious one. It teally is. Believe me.it is
B00D3LA71K|4.0|Let me begin by saying I'm not a fan of McConaughey or any of his movies, except for Reign of Fire which had dragons destroying things, and who doesn't love that.  Other than that, this movie was very good and I think one of his best.  The story was touching, never lagged, and had some action at the end with a good resolution.  Definitely worth purchasing or at the least renting, you won't be disappointed.
0062515675|5.0|I work as a regional manager and this book really helped me focus on what is important in my life.  I strongly recommend it for people who have lost touch with their inner self.
B004UXUX7S|5.0|Not only is it a great movie, but the blu-ray quality is awesome. The digital copy comes through iTunes, which is great since I can play it on my Macbook Pro, iPad, and iPhone 5, too.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|While there are some problems, this is the most realistic hunting game on the kindle, or any tablet so far.
B0036EH3TS|5.0|Due to the setting and plot of the movie, the blu-ray quality provides a great picture for when watching it.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I love american horror story, but it just was not my thing this season. Still a great story and show though.
B003Y5H542|5.0|The blu-ray quality for this movie seemed to be more noticeable than other blu-ray discs, even though it's a cartoon movie.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I think this game is the best though you can't make portals in creative mode...... I'd give it a 5star if you could, and you never see enderman and there my favorite mob so I'm a little upset so can you make that update notch I'd give it a 5star rating and I've seen herobrine 10 times and can you get rid of him he scares the crap out of me so can you please make these updates for minecraft pocket edition I'll be so happy and I never find diamonds I dig till I can't dig anymore and still no diamonds please add more diamonds :)
B000Q6ZG5M|4.0|The blu-ray quality makes the Harry Potter theme & setting even better! I was sent the version released in England, though.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so awesome. It's definitely worth more than 7 $. It's graphics r really cool and for any1 with an &quot;over reactive imagination.&quot; SO THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BUY IT PEOPLE IT IS AWESOME!!!!!!!
B000Q6ZG5C|5.0|The blu-ray quality adds to the greatness of the whole Harry Potter theme and setting. Gives a great picture quality.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Acting is superb, writing brilliant, and one of the best shows I have seen in a while. I did not know about it until two weeks ago and a friend told me I could find it on Amazon TV. Binged viewing for two days and wish I had more to watch!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The blu-ray provides great quality picture, and the digital copy via Flixster is convenient sometimes. I just wish it was through iTunes instead.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Its a family full of fun.  Everyone from my wife to my three yr old loves the gsme.  He will set snd play forever.
B000W10AEI|5.0|The blu-ray quality of the movie provides that extra &#34;awesomeness&#34; to the whole Harry Potter theme and setting. Love it!
B009V0TV6O|3.0|As others have stated, I appear to have received the free version of this app, since it says \\"free\\" in the app title on my device. I don't know if there's a difference between the two versions of the app, or why it says \\"free\\" when it's supposed to be the paid version.<br /><br />I have not tried uninstalling and reinstalling, since that seems like an unnecessary hassle. I would be interested in hearing from the developer on this matter.
0439023521|5.0|love these books there so good to read and very happy with them im for sure going to keep reading more
B009I2UH2W|1.0|rarely write a review. very heavy user of amazon, this is total junk. broke after 2 weeks of very limited usage. not certified by Apple so you keep getting notifications that it is \\"not compatible.\\" don't buy.

B00007KQKM|5.0|It's not commonly acknowledged, perhaps because the old dispute about obscenity still makes people nervous even though the book would be considered mild by contemporary standards.  But the story of Lady Chatterley is comparable to many of Shakespeare's plays in terms of human interest, complex characters and complex motivations for the characters, and many ways the story can be shaped by emphasis in production.  This film has some complex and very interesting ways of telling the story.
B0053FANQS|5.0|i need all the the movies i love them there made good and i love cars so it helps yes
B00BAXFCPO|4.0|The book was very compelling and caused me to think even more seriously about the impact of sugar and wheat on my health. I already read Wheat Belly by Dr. William Davis which was also very compelling. Having a perspective from both a cardiologist (Wheat Belly) and a neurologist (Grain Brain) has definitely motivated me to stay away from wheat and sugar. I would have rated the book 5 stars except for the fact that some of the book was so scientific and technical that it was difficult to understand at times. Overall though, I definitely recommend this book and have been recommending it to many of my friends.
159413586X|5.0|ths book is really nice and im very happy with it would for look for more wrote from them too
B006ATJXQW|5.0|Amazing book intense so glad they made a prequel to the maze runner series recommend it to all your friends

B007WFTFG6|1.0|This app only works occasionally. I added this to my Kindle for my 3 year old granddaughter. It is a big disappointment.

B00AB7HESI|5.0|&#34;I'd like to see a tree.&#34;<br />&#34;Thanks. But make it a redwood with a tree house in it and a monkey eating a banana. Really? You can do that&#34;<br /><br />It seems as if there's no end for what you can ask for and receive on this app. I don't even care about the game - my daughter loves it, though, I just enjoy the crap out of asking for obscure things and getting them. I believe that this is an Alien technology and that Warner Brothers is holding their leader hostage to keep building it.
B002BWP49C|5.0|these movies are so good i just needed  these to finish the rest of the movies yes love it for sure
B000SEJHRA|5.0|I've read this a half a dozen times and listened to it on CD a half a dozen more and it never gets old. The stories read well and quickly and this book, like his others, offer relatable insights into things that we generally experienced but kind of put away into our minds for fear of exposing too much of ourselves. I wish that my wife was as comfortable as his family and Hugh are about his candidness.
B008Y7FQ6E|3.0|Tommy. Lee Jones is good in the movie<br />Book is probably hard to translate to movie, if you read it as I did it probably is not as good a movie as it would be if you hadn't. That's why 3 star's
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|Pacific Rim was amazing. The graphics that went into this movie are absolutely stunning. I thoroughly enjoyed it. My 7 year old loved it! The plot was simple and easy to follow along, probably too simple in my opinion. Its your basic monsterous alien destroying earth versus robot trying to save it. Worth seeing!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is the best game ever! I have been waiting for them to put this game on the amazon appstore. Hope u love it too:)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Works great and so much fun.  I resisted this game for a long time UNTIL I saw it available on my Kindle Fire.  Now I can't stop!!!!!  Runs great and smooth!
B009V0TV6O|4.0|I appear to have gotten the full version.... It may have been a glitch early on? This does happen once in a while!<br /><br />The app seems to do what it advertises as a metronome. I only played with it for a few, but all the different settings seem to work.<br /><br />If you got the free version, try deleting from your cloud as suggested in another review and downloading it again. These are supposed to be reviews of the app itself, not your venting grounds because you didn't get something for free! I wonder how many whiners took the same amount of time to email Amazon?
B00AAX68HG|3.0|I mean it's ok but not great . you can't even tell if it is pudding or jello other than that it is ok
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|You will not be disappointed!! I'm addicted!! Gonna need candy crush rehab! Just wish there was a quicker way to get lives without having to pay...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you...Thank you....Thank you!!! So glad that I can play this on my kindle now instead of my cell phone! Farm Saga next????
B00EVW013E|5.0|Love this movie! Action packed! Channing Tatum and Jamie Fox great movie chemistry!  Can't wait to see more of these two in the future. A must watch film.  Channing Tatum, need we say more!
B008QTVNUI|4.0|although we found this a good program it at times does fall into a predictable plot otherwise it is a fresh look into the way things are handled with national security
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Fun yes, but Damn I hate being forced to play social. Only way you can play this quietly on your own will cost you hundreds of dollars or limited to about a half hour of play before you have major waiting games (a half hour each interval) to get more lives. Sigh.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad to finally be able to play this game.  It's a lot of fun.  The only thing I would like better is if u were able to get the boosters without having to pay.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I'm so depressed that Tris doesn't get to live in the world she fought so hard to create. I loved the first 2 books but this was a complete let down and such a disappointment. I respect the author and what she was trying to do but I guess I just feel there was a better way to end it.
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|I have purchased a number of movies from Amazon.<br />This one goes at the bottom of the pile.<br />There was another reviewer who wrote that this is NOT the typical Will Smith movie.<br />In my opinion, that is accurate statement.<br />The CGI seems a bit overdone.<br />Ok, that's not something that means a movie rates one star.<br />The producers laid the bulk of this movie square on young Mr. smith 's shoulders.<br />It was simply too much task ask of him.<br />I wish that over the course of his career Jaden enjoys even more success than his Dad.<br /><br />With that said, his performance in this movie was exceptionally rigid.<br />I truly cannot think of a movie that I have seen in the last ten years that was this bad.
034580404X|5.0|I love this trilogy. I cannot wait for the movie to come out. I was so glad they still had these books for me to purchase since I waited so long since the release to purchase them.
B003N7ORNI|5.0|Once again rick riordan has surprised me with every little detail. I loved his Percy Jackson books, and now I love his cane chronicles books. Ive always found Egyptian mythology fascinating, the way hes integrated it into the modern world is truly incredible. Not only is the story entertaining but the knowledge that you receive is rather interesting as well.
031623480X|1.0|I purchased this book and returned it. It was not what I expected. Cuts our to much and adds in things I wouldn't eat.
B002KV4NTQ|5.0|This is one of the Rolling Stones truly classic albums. Moonlight Mile is a wonderful song that just didn't get its due recognition and to me is worth the price of the album alone.
B00C6XBESQ|5.0|I don't use &#34;beautiful&#34; to describe music albums all the time, but it definitely fits.  Zaz once again beautifully blends jazz and pop to create a unique sound all her own.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I really wish the news feed would work most of my news feed that is supposed to have pictures, JUST have blank square.
B0063M22QO|3.0|The Kindle Tablet Edition of Mahjong is okay but I like the Mahjong Deluxe HD better. There are not as many layouts as there are in the Mahjong Deluxe HD.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Awesome game. I love it!  I just can't get enough of this game lololololololololol awesome lo lo lo love it
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I like the Mahjong Deluxe HD games because there are lots of different mahjong games to play. Mahjong is my favorite games.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book. I read the first two books in about a week and half. I could not put the first two books down. Now, this book was another story.<br />I found this book VERY boring I actually was having a hard time following the book let alone picking it up to read it. I found the POV not very good or interesting. I normally love POV in this case I found it not very good. Nor did I like the writing at all. I had a hard time remembering who's POV it was. I do not recommend this trilogy to anyone after reading this book.<br />I also found Tobias's out of charter in this book. In the first two books he was a strong and confident man. In this book I found him depressed and weak.<br />Tris death is the carnal role...YOU NEVER KILL OF THE MAIN CHARTER. I think I would have been more happy with Tobias dying. I do not see the point of killing her off. After all of the emotional games Mrs.Roth played with us in the second book with Tris and Tobias I think she owed it to the readers to at least make them happy together at the end.
B00FG0LS8C|1.0|the item received was not the same as pictured, somehow instead of coming from amazon it came from a third party. so that is the one star. the product itself is great, I own the corresponding dvd set, and loved having all of the standup and sit down shows, now I can have the soundtrack to that dvd. (where is the blu ray) if you can find this item it's great, as you need to have the book form, it looks nicer on the shelf and will match the complete 50s series as well as the sets from the 60s and 70s. So it's like having a collection. however I did not receive that version. I can't give this item as good star rating on amazon if I did not receive the pictured version but for those wondering about the content of the set it's superb and looks great (I've seen one someone else had) and will look great either with your albums or with your books. the printing job is great, and since this was elvis comeback you can be guaranteed that the music rocked and sounded great. the album is worth five stars easy and you should also buy the 3dvd set available here as well.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is the old SK style at its best! Doctor sleep is being stated as the sequel to \\"The Shining\\" but you could actually read this one, even if never read the first. It takes us on a journey of now grown Danny(the little boy from the shining)we get to experience more of his \\"talents\\", as well as seeing him fight for his own personal survival from his demons,as well as helping a young girl abbra with very strong talents of her own. We are introduced to road traveling creepy RV owners! A book that will get into your head, that you find yourself thinking about it, wanting more of it, when involved in other parts of life. As most of SK books, did take a lil bit to get into it but when you do...you do! Welcome back SK (I enjoyed this w/ the unabridged Audible version)
B008VI0A2G|5.0|Five cds of the classic fifties. In a book form that is easy enough to read, except on a few pages where the font and the background seem to do battle with your eyes. But overall a great way to repackage a legendary set. A Must have for any elvis fan, and this will look great either with your other albums or on the bookshelf a great collection in any form though. You won't be disappointed at all with this purchase. You can get it at a great price as well.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|'All of the lights' is a very misunderstood pop song. Here the track breaks out into a rocky-esque jingle. A grand soundscape that conjures up the feeling of heightened glamour and happiness. Dreams come true here.<br /><br />\\"if you want it you can get it for the rest of your life\\"<br /><br />\\"Fast life, drug life, thug life, rock life... every night\\"<br /><br />But underneath this layer of glitter and gold, Kanye is actually singing verses about a very different kind of light.<br /><br />Kanye has walked in to find his girl with another man<br /><br />\\"Im headed home, im almost there, im on way, im up the stairs, to my surprise, a ni**er replacing me\\"<br /><br />and the original chorus 'Turn up the lights... I want you to see everything' all of a sudden takes a completely different meaning<br /><br />Realise:<br />That rock life is full of empty promises. This is actually a very bitter and resentful song once you open your ears to his lyrical poetry.<br /><br />And this track is the epitome of the theme that runs deep throughout this album. A perfect example of how misunderstood Kanye West is. Insecure, paranoid, and in many ways completely aware of the double edged fame&fortune. Its amazing how many people dance to this pop song and are absolutely oblivious to its real intentions.<br /><br />I could write a ten page essay on the sort of quality we see in his work on this album. But I'll leave the rest for the listener to enjoy.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|This is the best album from the summer. It is like a nice combo of techno and disco. Typical for Daft Punk.
0071390111|5.0|Ever since I used the first edition in Chiropractic School, I have been able to keep up with the changing face of neurology with Dr Kandel et al.'s careful and judicious choice of subject matter and presentation.  Kudos to Dr. Kandel and all his learned colleagues and contributors.  I hope this book continues to set the bar for all neurology texts of its kind<br />Dr. Jonathan A. Curzon<br />Chiropractic Neurologist
B007HO392S|5.0|I have never bought an album by any AI singer winner or otherwise, but this one may change my future music purchasing attitudes.  Though hard pressed to call this straight country, the vocals, music and lyrics blend together to form one of the best country pop offerings in recent years.  Especially of note are the title tune and two black cadillacs.  These two songs veer away from the sweetness offered in the other tracks to give a little note of the badass in ms. Underwood's character. All in all a very enjoyable listening experience.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I love it. It is sturdy and protects my Kindle Fire HD. I've carried my Kindle in my purse and it still looks new. It came in several colors. I was able to get it in my favorite color - purple. Great value.
B004LROMWU|5.0|I really enjoy this series. I hope to get all of them. Its nice not to have to have commercials interupting the show. I get to rewatch it as much as I wish.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Only complaint is having to buy more lives. Very addicting!!!  Graphics very easy on the eyes.  Less fattening than chocolate
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The designs are so intricate and I love the inclusion of Alchemy! &quot;The Room&quot; is one of my favorite apps! Each puzzle leads to a new one and it almost seems never ending. I could play this for hours on end! It is a sort of workout for your brain so it isn't that bad to play.
B003WJ81MA|5.0|I loved Legend as a child, and fell in love with it again after watching it recently. A very emotional and visually beautiful experience.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I enjoyed the game, but when I ran out of coins....purchasing them on my kindle was not explained well enough.  I have issues retrieving my purchases to continue the game.  Apparently the coins I purchased went to amazon & not the coin dozer game when I purchased coins during the game.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I very much enjoyed the first 2 books in the Divergent Series.  I was also enjoying the last book, right up until the end. Veronica Roth took the absolute lazy way out of the story.  She had a challenge to make her plot work, but instead of taking the challenge she did the lazy thing.  I am surprised that her editors have allowed her to make the grievous error in her writing, but they probably assumed that everyone that is a fan of the series was going to purchase the book immediately, so they didn't care.  They got our money and that's all that matters to them.  Shame on Veronica Roth and shame on her editors for not doing their job.
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|angry birds is easy and a great way to pass the time...quickly and mindlessly.<br />Like waiting in a doctors 'office  or child's play
B001P4ESGC|5.0|Again they do surprise you, I usually can surmise the out come, but not this show, my mouth is always hanging open, very good, I really like Scandel so this is again edge of your seat show.
B00CWIMY3O|5.0|Simply put, this is the most visually stunning show on television today. Lighting, makeup and cinematography are all second to none. The stories are twisted, disturbing and expertly acted by a super-talented cast. This isn't just aother TV spin-off. Hannibal is truly fascinating and original in every way.
B00DUCXFUC|5.0|This is quite a great package if you have never bought any of the DVD's separately or if you only have one of them. Other than that, it seems like the little additions to the DVD's and the collectibles may not be enough to justify the purchase. In any other case you will feel glad you purchased this!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very good game but there are a few bugs so like when I went to put in my horses name it wouldn't let me put it in
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Excellent closure to the long saga. Much better than the 4th book. New characters add unforseen twists. Tyrion is back in full swing which is great
B007U4DIM6|3.0|This one was not nearly as good as 1 & 2.  We were actually very disappointed in it as the others were so cute.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|After reading all of his other works I was expecting a little more when I began SteelHeart.  I was excited at the concept of a new \\"magic\\" system and a new Sanderson world that for the most part almost feels real.  I'm going to begin this review with a bit of negative, If you have read Mistborn then this book is very similar in style, plot and pacing.  It almost felt like I was reading a re-working of the book set in a more modern age.  I don't think the magic system was all that interesting as his works tend to have more explanation ( although this may be dealt with in the next book) and the twist at the end ( no spoilers I promise) was for me foreseeable from the middle.  To be perfectly honest it kind of fell flat as a new story.  Now that the negative is over I'd like to go through the positive, as I said it shares a lot of similarities with Mistborn, and that includes me not being able to put it down.  The action is fast paced, the protagonist relatable, the metaphors terrible and the main characters were all represented well.  It is definitely worth a read, but almost certainly not his best work.  I can see it improving if the second book builds on story and offers something more interesting than the usual overthrow power then rebuild it we were given with Mistborn.<br /><br />I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 because I can see (hopefully) Sanderson taking it somewhere more interesting.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Daily challenges keep the game fun and exciting, the missons keep the game interesting. I have had days where I just couldn't put Subway Suffers down.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|This Blu-ray looks really good. The Story was a little slow but I still enjoyed It. It's a good popcorn movie
B0089LOG02|5.0|This wonderful story speaks to the heart of every person that has ever endured constant tragedy and never gave up. I felt so deeply about the characters in this book and wanted to change the outcomes for them as I read but like the characters I soon realized that it was the tragedies that built the people I feel in love with in this book.
B004UNX1LS|3.0|this is a great app for music videos just wish it wouldn't crash in the middle of a video even after I updated it still crashs
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally on my kindle and is connecting to my Facebook. Loving it playing more often . Hoping to conquer more and more levels.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was sort of a guilty pleasure because I used to think I hated any non-realistic genre, but my English-teacher daughter said it was good, well-written and had some good lessons as well, so I read it and loved it. I recommend it to young adults and elderly ones as well.It's scary, daring, uplifting and infuriating. Yummy entertainment.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Great story line and I am not sure whether or not I liked how everything ended.  At the beginning of the book, and until I got to know the characters and how they were all connected, it seemed that the book jumped around too much and it was hard to know where I was and who the author was talking about.  After I was further into the book, the characters and the storyline got VERY INTERESTING!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm glad there's a Kindle version now! I already play on my laptop and my phone. I like using my Kindle in bed :) and it's bigger than my phone screen.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This is the third copy of this movie that I have purchased as I have given it to two other people/families.  This is an excellent movie for special education teachers and families who may have an autistic child!  Actually, it would be great for anyone who has contact with an autistic child.  It puts the focus on all of the opportunities and talents of an autistic child rather than focusing on all of the negatives.  I saw Temple speak at a convention a couple of years ago.  At the end of her talk a boy in the audience asked her:  &#34;If I work really hard at something I really like, then I can be (as successful) as you?&#34;  There was a long silence as Temple scanned the audience, then looking back at the boy said:  &#34;Yes, YOU can!&#34;  It was a very moving conclusion to a wonderful and uplifting talk!  Claire Dane portrays Temple's enthusiasm and commitment to rising way above what is perceived by some as a disability.
B00CZ1TMUQ|5.0|Another masterpiece by these 2 amazing young singers! A bit different than the first album, yes, but great nevertheless.<br /><br />Some people are complaining that the CD is not like the first, bla bla bla. True artists explore new melodies, new styles, improve themselves and deliver better quality songs and voice to their fans and that's exactly what Jonathan and Charlotte did in this album! Their beautiful voices only get better...their synchronicity is amazing. Great job guys!
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|This book was the final book in a series of 2. Chris Colfer is a great author and took me through everything that the characters went through throughout the series. He describes everything in such detail that I could feel all the emotions of  the characters. At times I felt like I was actually there. PLEASE MAKE A NEW ONE!!!!<br />I also had no idea that THE CHRIS COLFER from Glee wrote books for children! GO GLEE!!!!!<br /> _ Alexandra Wallace 4 th grade age 10 Alt. GA
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever I think the game is doing good but if your not patient enough it may get annoying
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Love these generation sagas! This one covers some of the most devastating events of the century. I can't imagine living through these events!
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|interesting book but, not really anything new here. I have read a lot like it..you just have to do the work!
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is awesome it has saved me from borin events and I would definitely recommend it to adults as well as children my 4 year old little sister loves to play it to....
0756404746|4.0|When I began this book, the writing style almost put me off. It was different as it began with the main character telling about his past, rather than how most stories start off with it being the present time. The only other time I've encountered this is in the Saxon Series by Cornwell, but it was handled slightly differently. However, it didn't take me long to get sucked into The Name of the Wind. I look forward to reading more bout Kvothe and his extremely different life. I enjoy a wide range of author's and while all may not have the literary expertise of Shakespeare, if the story is fun or interesting I'll like it. Rothfuss pulled this off, so to me this is definitely worth the read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is a very very fun game to play with friends and family. In my house we all play candy crush saga and have competitions in the family
B00FX8EY60|4.0|A little over produced for my taste but the songs are solid and honest and her voice sounds great.  Hearing her performance during the iheart radio Prism release party gave me a different perspective on the validity of these songs... Too bad she didn't record Dark Horse without Juicy J..
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Walking dead is awesome, can't wait for the next episode. If you haven't started watching,  I don't know what you're waiting for
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I have played 2 levels so far and I am impressed with the graphics and strategy of this game. I'm hooked!
B0007LXPBI|4.0|Hi i got the movie today. thank you it in great shape and i wached it and i was inpressed it came today i was happy it came on time and in really great sape. thank you so much i dont know what ease you need to know about it thanks a lot again
B00BD99JMW|4.0|There is a ton of stuff going on as this trilogy comes to an ending so horrible that I sobbed long after I finished it. I want to say more but I'm so crushed by Tris' death that I don't have the patience. I'm sure Roth and the publishers realized that killing our hero would result in bad reviews and possibly anger a large percentage of Divergent fans. I hope that she explains this decision at some point in the near future because until she does I'm having a very hard time understanding Allegiant.<br /><br />This book is a heartbreaking way to end a story I desperately love. Read it and weep. Tris and Four FOREVER!
B009V0TV6O|4.0|Comes with several preset 4/4 rhythms.  To change time signature, swipe the 'accent every # beats' number at upper left, and that will change the number of note sections before repeat.  The tempo can be changed with the slider, or by long pressing the BPM number and entering numbers.  The rhythm of each beat can be changed by long pressing its note. There are 9 slots in the presets (Empty 12 thru Empty 20) to create your own rhythms.  The other presets can also be edited, but I wouldn't.  The choice to accent or not accent a specific note group doesn't seem to work correctly.  An interesting and useful app with room for improvement, especially in the visibility of various options, such as 'play' and stop (tap upper right large blank area).
B0036G8IQS|5.0|great and exhilarating and electrifying couldnt put the book down ,amazing ,surprising dont stop reading it will get way way better. read on!
B009HNDCC4|5.0|Modern Family consistently looks at tough sensitive topics  from multiple cultural viewpoints and finds a healthy way to laugh the everyday humanity in all of us. Bravo!!! The value of a laugh and smile cannot be quantified.
B0079T9HL8|5.0|This vest system is worth every penny! It is well constructed and comfortable, and it makes it easy and painless to tote around two cameras at once. Wearing two cameras around your neck for any period of time is painful and bothersome, so I rarely took both cameras with me on a shoot. Now I can easily bring two bodies equipped with different lenses, and I'm prepared for nearly anything.<br /><br />My first test of this vest was over several days of hard hiking. The weight of both cameras was so perfectly balanced, it honestly felt as if I wasn't even carrying them. But best of all was that my neck didn't get sore and the cameras weren't swinging around, clunking into one another. Both cameras were easily accessible.<br /><br />I highly recommend this vest!
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|I picked up this book to find out what the big deal was about Jack Reacher. I regret that decision. I don't want to be too hard on Mr. Child as this is the first book in the series, and I believe his first novel. But I can't look past a few of the things.<br /><br />Reacher has no motivation whatsoever until about mid-way through the novel. I kept asking myself 'why is he doing this?' and was never really able to come up with much of an answer. To top it off, Reacher is really a boring, bland character. He has no personality, even though the story is told in first person perspective.<br /><br />The writing is very short and non-descript. Short, clipped sentences that add very little flourish to the story, and at the same time don't pull you in much. No matter how good the story is, if its not written well, it won't pull you in. I wasn't pulled in at all and really had to force myself to finish. As an example, during the climax of the novel, it would have been a perfect opportunity to mix Reacher's emotion with action. Instead we got things like 'I calculated the angles in my head, and fired.' To me, that is language that is more suited to a science text book than an action novel.<br /><br />All in all, not worth all the buzz circulating around about it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a very addictive game. I love it. I love that you can play it on facebook, on your phone, ipod and now kindle.
B001EC2IT4|4.0|I love this movie, but be prepared for a little off color and racey scenes, that at first you would not expect. But once BeatleJuice is on stage, well it may be time to put the young kids to bed.<br />This move is original and fun. enjoy
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is a fun game to play and the ease makes it even better. Thank you for making it for Kindle.
B00EP0KYDO|4.0|I love that Will wants his son to follow in his footsteps. I think is a great kid but the accent was annoying after a while, it sounded like he was trying to hard. other than that the movie was an enjoyable ride from start to finish. Anytime a son can rescue his dad is a good day. Well done smith family.
B008M721MS|5.0|Google Jay-Z and the other hand in a way that you have to be able to get the best possible price
B000LVAQDE|5.0|There were so many firsts in this movie and so much to think about after. With all the gulf war veterans simmering today they could do a remake with a modern twist.<br />A war vet minding his own business gets harassed by the law and ultimately wrongfully charged. They have no idea who they are messing with. Action packed finish and very real plot makes this a five star for me.
006202406X|1.0|I was a huge fan of both Divergent and Insurgent. I loved the storyline, the pacing and most of all, the characters. I had Allegiant delivered to my door the day it came out and I rushed home to begin reading it. I must say that it is quite possibly the worst ending to a series I have ever read. I actually wish I had never read it and just imagined my own ending to the trilogy. I won't give out spoilers but I found the storyline to be boring, drawn out and quite pointless. There were so many directions to pick up where Insurgent left off and this was clearly the wrong choice to make. It felt like this book was rushed to the public and not as thought out as the previous two. I request a redo. Also, without ruining it for anyone, the big shock at the end of the book was ridiculous. It did not need to happen at all. There could still have been the same message of hope and moving forward done in many other ways. Simply put, read it because you want to know what everyone is talking about but you will wish you didn't. Awful, terrible, hated it.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I have always enjoyed this author's books.  I like books that weave a story from history.  This was totally enjoyable and a moving story.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so glad that this game is finally on Amazon. It's a game that should be everywhere! Good for kids as well
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion Rush is sooooooooooooooooo FUN!!!!! You can dress your minion in different disguises and run in different locations.It is easy to collect bananas and you can complete achievements to earn tokens.Just don't close the app when it is loading because it takes a long time to load the first time,but it's worth it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like it but not the time limits<br /><br />I do not understand the need for time outs and needing more lives.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is a game that keeps your mind working and can be very addictive.  The only section that I don't like, is the wait for more lives.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is the best poopy game ever!!! It just really makes me want to poop and have sex with some girl.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I am very happy that this is now available on my Kindle. I love this game and can play it all the time now.
B000YAYIXQ|5.0|What a voice,  took me surprise.  A friend had me listen to her down load and  I loved it.  Will probably get another.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is so fun and challenging to find all of the objects to open and close cabinets etc. and find your way out to the room to the next one.
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|Overall,  I was entertained.  My wife and I watch this together,  we both enjoyed it for the cost of a rental (HD) and I enjoyed it.  However, don't spend too much time tthinking about the plot.  I actually think it would work better as a mini series.  This would give some time to develop the back story.  More importantly, I found the concept of the mind meld  interesting and I didn't wish there was more time to explore this further.  So in fact, I would enjoy this more if the story were more spread out.  Probably would rate it lower if I saw this in a movie theater and paid  those higher prices.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Candy crush is a fun game. I am not great at it but getting better and it is still fun.<br />It's just right but I want candy.now!  :)
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game.  Lots of tournaments and great selection of games and slots.  Sit back, relax and enjoy.  Have fun with it.
B00F2362IE|5.0|This game is the best! As soon as I saw the show, I had to play the game. It ROCKS!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad it's finally on the kindle.  It's about time.  This is a great 3 alike game with many a great twists. Many love this game and if you haven't tried it, soon you'll be hooked. it's not difficult, but as you progess the more challenging the games become.
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|A little to much dramatics and obvious set up for more and more sequels. Good graphics and backdrops for this movie
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I enjoyed watching the this TV series season 3. I just wished I had watch it from the beginning. Thank you.
0767827902|5.0|Some will argue that \\"The Last Picture Show\\" is one of the best movies ever made.  Its story takes place primarily in the fictional dying town of Anarene, Texas.  The town is portrayed as dying physically, environmentally, economically, culturally and socially.  It has many open dirt areas not strongly held in place by the roots of robust plants.  It is in a flat, windy area where dust clouds of loose dirt whip through town, causing poorly fastened or broken main street doors to flap wildly.  For recreation, the locals can go to Anarene High School events, play pool, drink, or drive out to \\"the tank,\\" a lake surrounded by flat, desert-like land with a few clumps of brush.  It is filmed in black & white, emphasizing the pathetic dreariness of the land in and around Anarene.  I see \\"The Last Show\\" as a documentary-like film revealing how the disintegrating social structure of a town leads to the departure of the very wealthy and very smart and to the simultaneous victimizing of the super nice, friendly and caring but intellectually deficient.  The large cast is led by six world-class actors including Timothy Bottoms, Jeff Bridges, Ben Johnson, Cybill Shepherd, Cloris Leachman and Ellen Burstyn.  The character named Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) is the nice guy who is unfairly hurt the most.  He seems to interact with most of the other actors in the movie.  Timothy Bottoms is brilliant in the role of Sonny but so are the other five top-flight actors.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Could not put the book down you will not be sorry.  John green captures the reader from the very first page
B0091P69CI|4.0|\\"Zodiac\\" demonstrates again that Fincher is a modern master of thriller movies. A tale of serial murder in central California from July to October, 1969 (with some `70's Zodiac 'related' scenes in the third act) it was tense and enthralling throughout. I highly recommend it, with the caveat that there are many factual errors and inaccuracies. \\"Zodiac\\" is 'based' on Robert Graysmith's controversial book about the Zodiac murders. Gyllenhaal`s, Ruffalo's and Downey's performances are top notch with Ruffalo's as SFPD Inspector Dave Toschi much like a tender DeNofrio. I loved watching all three perform. Anthony Edwards gives a wonderful supporting performance as Inspector Tosci's partner, Bill Armstrong. Gyllenhaal's and Downey's portrayals of their real-life counterparts are misleading, especially Downey's, who plays San Francisco Chronicle reporter Paul Avery. By more than one contemporary account, Avery was a responsible journalist and NOT a chronic substance-abuser. Graysmith's books on the Zodiac murders do not indicate an author committed to factual and credible evidence.<br /> Robert Graysmith, long a media darling, has written two books on the Zodiac murders:  \\"Zodiac\\" (1986) and \\"Zodiac Unmasked:...\\" (2002). These books have been demonstrated to be rife with inaccuracies, errors, and dubious suppositions as well as lacking credible references. For amateur sleuths and historians interested in finding out about the Zodiac murders, I recommend the website zodiackillerfacts.com. Please note: I am not the author of that website.
147674355X|5.0|I loved the book and fell in love with the characters.  I'm now reading Losing Hope, which is told through Holders point of view. I would definitely recommend these books.
B00000J2PH|5.0|THIS CD ALSO BRINGS BACK HS MEMORIES TOO! I BELIEVE THE FIRST TIME I HEARD THIS &#34;ALBUM' WAS WHEN I WAS 14 AND VISITING FAMILY IN ITALY.  I WAS AT THE US NAVAL BASE IN NAPLES WITH FRIENDS AND SOME OF THE SAILORS HAD THEIR RADIO ON AND THEY WERE PLAYING &#34;YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND&#34; AND I WAS HOOKED ON THE ARTIST CAROL KING!  SHE IS A VERY ACCOMPLISHED WRITER/SINGER AND I FEEL ALL SHOULD DISCOVER HER AND ENJOY WHAT SHE HAS DONE!<br /><br />ENJOY!!
B00E687MWQ|4.0|This album seemed to stray slightly from Satyricon's previous offerings on the first listen. After listening a few times that signature Satyricon sound started to become more apparent and the album started sounding better and better.
B001TH16DI|4.0|I got all six movie for less than half of the regular price on Amazon.  Brand new Star Trek blu-rays for less than 5 bucks a movie, not bad.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Clever exploration of aspergers and life as an adult with this brain wiring. A funny portrait of love and relationship.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I really have too much fun playing this. The graphics and game play are simple but I'm always amused. Yep. Would recommend to anyone who likes kind of mindless leveling and puzzles.
B00BXI0IHS|4.0|Haven't finished this book yet but loving the twists turns and depth to the story. I can't wait to find out how it ends.
B00CWIMVDW|5.0|LOVE!! Hannibal Lecter is my all time favorite character, and this series is amazing!! Can't wait for season 2!! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!
B008RKGF1I|5.0|I have always loved the movie &#34;Flashdance&#34; and watch it every time it comes on TV, so I was happy to see it featured on Amazon. The movie has a great cast, the acting is captivating as well, and the plot is well written and has something for almost everyone, but it is the music and choreography which is the star here, IMO. Love it, and cannot say enough good things about it. If you haven't seen it, it is well worth watching.
B007SPPANM|5.0|I DON'T KNOW HOW MANT TITANIC MOVIES THERE ARE OUT THERE .BUT THIS HAS TO BE THE BEST ONE I BELIVE THE DIRECTOR TOOK CERTAIN CUTS FROM THE ORIGINAL B&W MOVIE AND USED THEM IN THIS MOVIE
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that Candy Crush is now available on the Kindle!! Now I can be as addicted as all of my friends!! I'm well on my way..woo hoo!
B000002GA8|5.0|THIS LP IS FANTASTIC THEY TOOK THE STORY FROM THE ORIGINAL MOVIE AND PUT IT ON A CD.ALL I HAVE TO DO IS SIT BACK CLOSE MY EYES AND LIOSTEN TO THE GENIUS WHO PUT THIS LP TOGETHER
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Great packaging; easy initial set up but I have not got it to shake hands with my router which is in the next room.  I am not sure if I don't like it or it does not like me!!  I have done all the right things (I hope) - I have run setup five times and the icon shows on my Google Chrome toolbar but it does not recognize my Belkin router.  Also, my cable box has dropped some of my channels (related? - I don't know!)  When I have more time I will try again but it is not the plug and play that I had hoped.  Reverted to Netflix by mail!  Not for the faint hearted if things go wrong.
B002O3Z50G|5.0|I ENJOY THIS MOVIE EMENSELY ALSO THAT THE FACT THAT THE STORY IS REAL AS IT COULD BE.THIS MOVIE IS A KEEP SAKE MOVIE
B00BKZUVGM|5.0|I started this series about a week after Divergent came out. now, over 2 years later,im at the end. this is the saddest book ive ever read (and yes ive read the fault in our stars). Be Brave Tris
B007THA4FI|5.0|Ms. Rowling writes a great story.  She kept me wanting to come back to the book to see what was coming next.  I really enjoyed her adult books and I never read her Harry Potter series.
B006LSZECO|5.0|i read this and immediately bought all the rest of her books. great style writer  you will not be dissapointed  lots of twists and keeps you guessing till then end
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I love this book!  Written really well, scary in an intelligent way but not horrifyingly scary (yet).  Reminds me of older Strphen King novels like The Stand.  Love it!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so excited about this I was about to go and get me a Samsung tablet because they didn't have this game but I patiently waited. I am truly truly happy omg. It's been long time coming. I love you Amazon yt? The best.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is so cool. The graphics and the animals look so real and they will attack if you bother them. I really love this game
B004G0SJU8|4.0|the whole family enjoyed watching it it was great to all be in the same place at once with no fights
B00CHVJI08|5.0|this movie is great BUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TO WRITE A LONGER REVIEW BEFORE IT ALLOWS US TO FINISH THE REVIEW IS DUMB AND WILL KEEP FROM SOME GREAT REVIEWS BEING POSTED BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE DONT WANT TO WRITE A BUTT LOAD OF WORDS, we don't have to review the item. love the movie though and the toy and timing was perfect
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive, frustrating and fun all at the same time and I can play with my friends on fb also.  Great!
B00CL0J99K|4.0|very well done.  Downey and Kinglsey are fantastic, Paltrow is her usual weirdly hot, Don Cheadle is kind of in it, and the dude from Memento doesn't disappoint as super creepy.  great conclusion to the trilogy.  can't say i approve of the villain choice, but i guess it's somewhat of an origin story?
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|How sad and beautiful. This story is amazing and shows you how much we truly take for granted. These horrible things are happening now and most of the world has no idea. Please read, Malala may be this generations Anne Frank.
B0021L8V1Q|3.0|so this is the second iron man.  whoever did casting assumed we wouldn't notice the difference between Terrence Howard and Don Cheadle... because they're twins.  the movie is entertaining, lots of explosions, lots to be desired in the way of plot. but hey it gets us to avengers and the 3rd movie - and i can't very well have the others without this one.
B00G32OER4|3.0|Those of us who like a good horror movie are forever desperate to find one because there are so few good ones and I think this is largely responsible for the GREAT reviews this movie got. It's a bit of an Exorcist knock off in parts and the story line was a bit labored but it was definitely worth watching. If you've not seen &#34;Let Me IN&#34; or the English version entitled &#34;Let The Right One In&#34; (I prefer the original) watch it. Now THAT'S a five star horror movie!
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|Very high freaky factor due to the &#34;based on actual events&#34; aspect. I thought it was well done and acted strongly. If you like slasher movies this probably isnt for you, no gore or t&a.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Our son gave us Season 1 and we got hooked!  Loved Season 2 and looking forward to more when they come out.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|Interesting topic, clever title and it did portray  and humanize her reality. The writing style was choppy, didn't flow for me so it was more of a chore to read.
0553106635|5.0|Added to the 5 book collection of family member.  They loved it.  Looking forward to more in the series in the future.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I've been playing this game for some time now. It is pretty addicting in the beginning. And the color definition looks awesome! The only issue I've come across is the app doesn't link to levels you've reached from your phone app without fully exiting than 're entering. In other words, when you're on level 123 from your phone, it only shows the level you completed previously. Not a BIG deal, just slightly annoying.
0553108034|5.0|Added to my son's collection.  He's looking forward to more in the future.  Loved all of the Game of Thrones books.
B00FXEL00W|4.0|Somewhat predictable story of girl gets girl, girl loses girl to save career, girl is miserable until girl gets girl back but the characters are refreshing and appealing and you root for them to the end
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love it. I can watch netflix on my tv perfectly and with a better price than an appke tv.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|How this book merits 244 5 star reviews is mind boggling! I would have liked to stay with Rice through the end of the series, but I can safely say that's not gonna happen! There is no character development, movement in plot or change in pace. I truly believe I have expended more thought and energy in leaving this review than Rice has in writing this book.<br />Rice either has 244 very loyal family and friends or is paying for these reviews.
B00CWIMY3O|5.0|Deliciously dark , stunning production, fantastic cast..pushing the boundaries of tv as we know it..chilling psychological thriller/horror. Series of 2013
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad you finally got it. It's very addictive. My husband loves it too. It's my go to game when I can't sleep too.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|The room is very relaxing  had it less than 24 hour and I'm able to relax and slow my mind down.  The room help you think out side the box
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I must admit I am relatively, a new comer. The first I heard of songs by Florence + the machine were covers.<br />\\"Shake it out\\" on Smash and \\"Dog Days are Over\\" on The sing off. But it hasn't taken me long to fan out towards the originals.Its just taken me a long time to review them.<br /><br />~Track by track~<br />1.Dog Days are over-One of my favorites. It just makes me happy and I often end up dancing and singing along to it.<br />Its spectacular how Flo can make a song with some pretty interesting lyrics,peppy sounding. \\"The horses are coming,so you better run.\\" 5/5<br />2.Rabbit Heart(Raise it up)-Another good song. Granted the sound quality on my ipod copy is rather poor. I always seem to have to turn the volume up. But its a good song. I love the feeling it gives out. Happy but mystifying at the same time.\\"This is a gift it comes with a price.\\" 5/5<br />3. I'm not calling you a liar-Its interesting. Its like a reverse psychology,accusation. I like it but its not my favorite.\\"I'm not calling you a liar just don't lie to me.\\" 4/5<br />4.Howl- Typically makes me think of a Once Upon a Time character. I love the energy it gives off. Its just...its hard to describe really. \\"If you could only see the beast you've made of me.\\" 4/5<br />5.Kiss with a fist-I don't really like this one. Granted it kind of sounds like \\"Black horse and the cherry tree\\". Its just too intense for me. 1/5<br />6. Girl with one eye- Its actually kind of perverted if you really take a listen to the lyrics. At first, I would have given it a similar rating to the one above but now by some twist of fate... It has been added to my favorites. Good song to get out aggressions. good song. 5/5<br />7.Drumming song-good song. But in my book its overly sexual and gets stuck in my head way too easily. The short version: I attempted to write a book, this song was used for inspiration of a um certain scene*cough*. So...I kind of screwed it up for myself. I never did finish the book. 3/5<br />8.Between two lungs-Not really my taste. 2/5<br />9.Cosmic Love- Another favorite song off this album. I love the mysterious feeling it gives off. how it starts off slow/quiet then builds up and strengthens. \\"No dawn,no day. I'm always in this twilight in the shadow of your heart.\\" 5/5<br />10.My boy builds coffins-Not really my taste. 2/5<br />11.Hurricane Drunk- I like this one. Its one of those that I didn't like at first but eventually grew to love.<br />\\"And in the crowd I see you with someone else.\\" \\"But at least I like to think things can't get any worse\\". 4/5<br />12.Blinding-DEFINITELY yet another favorite. Its got that mystic feeling that's creepy but awesome at the same time.\\"No more dreaming of the dead as if death itself was undone.\\" 5/5<br />13.You've got the love-I don't think I have this one and I can't seem to remember why not. I always sing along-to the best of my ability when its playing in public places. Not loud, more under my breath. and I can't help but smile when i hear it.\\"You've got the love i need to see me through.\\" 4/5 (mainly because I don't know it as well as I'd like)<br /><br />I'm not the best at this reviewing stuff. But hopefully ,it helps somebody.
B004HEXSLI|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. I refer to this book when teaching. anyone reading this book will understand more about recovery than any other way. It is a good read. I mean by that, it is smooth to read, straight forward, and clear. Read it and understand more about yourself and anyone you like or love who has to go through the recovery process. As an old nurse, i like to pass this to my patients, too.
B005UZ1IJC|5.0|Great CD and it sure does bring back memories. The remix sound like you are really there. Done very tastefully.
B00EAIMGDW|2.0|I would say awesome but I am on a kindle fire and it starts to crash on the second to the last level in the tunnels and will not even load the last level of A Royal Rescue.  Other than being buggy what I could play was fun and challenging.  Please fix or patch and I will give it 5.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|I always find myself going there first when I need information about anything. Recipes, famous people, places, event a, history.

B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I plan to play all the versions. I wonder what it would be like if angry birds met Pac man.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It is the best game ive played in forever. There is nothing like it. Its for those hunters that really cant hunt and really want to. And for people who like having fun.
B008M87GJK|4.0|I watch BBC a lot on YouTube. More global then other news programs. I am going to see if it is available on crackle.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I really enjoy this series, the intrigue and twists and turns of a good &#34;who done it&#34; is a wonderful end to my day.<br /><br />I would recommend to anyone who has a element of being a secret detective inside of them. The story lines are terrific and entertaining.<br /><br />Thank you.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I played angry birds first on my roku box and am addicted now. My favorite part is getting to see the different environments.
B009V0TV6O|1.0|I also got the free (read almost useless) version, instead of the paid as was advertised. I'll raise the review when I can actually use the paid app.
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|Jeff Lindsay does a wonderful job depicting a character who is so lovable yet so so evil.  The growth and development of Dexter is interesting as well as thought provoking.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever there is so much to do and so many possible ways to solve a problem<br />And one of the best games in the whole wide world
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Title says it all this game is sooo much fun and very addictive. Great for people that enjoy problem solving or hidden picture games.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game has provided hours of entertainment for my children. I recommend it for anyone who has children and like free games. It works great on my Amazon kindle fire HD.

1401917232|1.0|Love Has Forgotten No One is the last book of Gary's self proclaimed &quot;DU trilogy series.&quot; This book has been 7 years in the making with release dates being pushed back and various reasons as to why this book has taken so long to be released. It has been a highly anticipated release among Renard's fans, as one can see 14- 5 star reviews written, dating back to 2009, prior to the book even being released.<br /><br />  After reading this book, it seems to me that Gary isn't even trying anymore. It is like he phoned this one in. This book makes DU look stellar in comparison, and if that was Gary's goal, he certainly succeeded. Otherwise, this is the same old rehashed song and dance with a &quot;new&quot; twist.<br /><br />  There is so much that can be said about this book, but I will only hit on some points.<br /><br />  The book begins by telling the reader this is about &quot;real&quot; spirituality, not this pop  media self help movement spirituality that has been passed off as real. Ironically, this book has a self help section in it which I'll address later on.<br /><br /> He then goes on to once again tell the reader the improbability of a layman such as himself being able to write this book without the inspiration of his &quot;teachers.&quot;  After reading this book, I think Gary is very capable of writing this book on his own, and in fact has done so. Actually, Gary is simply regurgitating much of the same things said in his other two books, so this is more of just repeating than actual writing. Also, Gary didn't write these books on his own. He had  the aid of Wapnick's current interpretation of the course. He had the help of the course itself. He had the help of &quot;pop quantum physics&quot; among other sources such as conspiracy theory documentaries.<br /><br />  Gary also once again makes the disclaimer that any errors are solely from him and not from his &quot;ascended masters.&quot; As with Gary's previous books, his &quot;ascended masters&quot; once again get facts wrong, further demonstrating in all likelihood that Gary's &quot;ascended masters&quot; are made up literary devices to sell books, rather than actual entities that appeared to him to bestow on us this &quot;wisdom&quot;.<br /><br />  It doesn't take very long for Gary to play the victim and his &quot;ascended masters to enable him to do so. By page 2 the reader is already hearing about the &quot;vendetta&quot; against him from other teachers out of jealousy. Gary continues to say the reason his story about ascended masters is criticized is because of his popularity. If jealousy of popularity were really the motivation behind the criticisms, then it would follow that Marianne Williamson would be more of a target, as she is far more popular than Gary Renard. Yet, the only person that continually takes pot shots at Marianne Williamson is ironically, Gary Renard.<br /><br />  In Gary's last book, his &quot;ascended masters&quot; criticized other teachers of the course and other teachers of other paths. Even going as far as to equate them with moving furniture around a burning house. Again, by page 4 the criticisms continue about how most course teachers haven't learned the course. Once again, spiritual elitism is being demonstrated that only Gary and a selected few are teaching the course. This specialness and criticisms of others and course teachers continues on page 7 and then page 9. In fact it continues throughout the book. His &quot;ascended masters&quot; even go as far as to state that 99% of course teachers don't have the (bleep) to tell their students the world is not real? Really, 99% of course teachers? That statement is so ridiculous, I don't think I even need to comment further.<br /><br />  Gary's &quot;ascended masters&quot; tell him not to record anymore, as a reason to quash the controversy of their reality, stating that whether they are real or not is superficial. The fact is, this is not a small point and it is hardly superficial. The claims that are being made by these &quot;ascended masters&quot; are extraordinary. The infallibility that they claim is undeniable.  The specialness in which they elevate Gary and A Course in Miracles above other teachers and paths, is IMO, antithetical to the course's teachings. So as to whether they really showed up to Gary or he made them up as literary devices is hardly superficial. In fact it is sloppy logic to take what these supposed &quot;ascended masters&quot; say almost as gospel and completely authoritative as a lot of Gary's fans do, and then in the same breath say the supposed source as to which these &quot;facts&quot; are coming from is a superficial point. This is a complete lack of critical thinking and discernment in favor of simply wanting to believe something is true.<br /><br />  Gary finally addresses a criticism I've had about his teachings which leads to what Wapnick calls, &quot; Using non-duality as a defense.&quot; Essentially, what the course calls trying to counteract error with &quot;knowledge&quot;, instead of correcting error from the bottom up. It is the idea of walking around thinking of everyone and everything as illusions, because they read it in a book, without understanding the nuances of the course's metaphysics. This has also been called, &quot;The Advaita Trap&quot; or  &quot;The Advaita Shuffle&quot; in other  non-dual spiritual circles. It's what leads to ego &quot;enlightenment&quot;.<br /><br />  Now, not only are other teachers and other paths criticized, but now even saying Namaste is criticized as belittling, because it speaks of &quot;me&quot; and &quot;you&quot; and making individuality &quot;real&quot;.<br /><br />  Yet the obvious is, to be a teacher of God, as the course says, you must still speak the language. Namaste is the recognition of Truth in your brother or as the course calls it, The Changeless Reality or Face of Christ in your brother. It is ridiculous to think that Jesus in his time didn't usepersonal pronouns such as &quot;I&quot; or &quot;you&quot; to convey his teachings, because he certainly uses them in the course speaking to &quot;you&quot;, referring to himself as &quot;I&quot; and speaking of his brothers. Gary is trying to be too clever for his own good and once again, circular sloppy logic just comes off as ridiculous.<br /><br />  I find it completely ironic that Arten, on page 15, states the ego loves differences, when &quot;A&amp;P&quot; continually point out the differences between Gary and other teachers and the course and other paths. In fact &quot;they&quot; continually try to carve out ACIM from the universal curriculum and exalt the course above other paths and Gary above other teachers.<br /><br />  But Gary doesn't just repeat the same old song and dance entirely. He also throws in what I call junk food for the mind, like mind traveling throughout the galaxy and entering a Pleiadian spacecraft and speaking with these enlightened Nordic looking extraterrestrials. Reading this section, I felt I was reading some L. Ron Hubbard science fiction novel, especially since L. Ron Hubbard claimed to have also made contact with these beings. I think Gary is just running out of ideas, because this part of the book is absolutely embarrassingly terrible.<br /><br />  Gary seems awestruck when told that the entire human race could collectively change the future. I don't know what is so revelationary about this, considering the course says that miracles require cooperation of the Sonship, because the Sonship is the sum of all that God created and miracles make minds One in God. This goes back to criticisms of this solipsistic idea of people walking around, completely self absorbed, thinking they are the center of the universe, discounting their brother and sisters as merely illusions, giving no reality to them.<br /><br />  &quot;A&amp;P  also make &quot;bold&quot; predictions about the weather like London having its first tornado, California gettingonly 2 inches of rain, etc. They tell Gary that this will happen later in the year. Yet, keep in mind that Gary speaks of last year being 2006-2007,  so this time frame is 2007-2008.<br /><br />  Actually, these bold predictions are not impressive on two counts. The first being, this book came out in 2013, so this was easily written after these events happened. It is very easy to &quot;predict the future&quot; when you are speaking about the past. The second is, London recorded a tornado in Dec. 2006. &quot;A&amp;P&quot;'s claim is this will happen in 2007-2008. It also seems that London was hit by a tornado in October of the year 1091. So this is not the first tornado as claimed by the infallible &quot;ascended masters.&quot; How can &quot;all knowing ascended masters&quot; continually get facts wrong? I'm amazed at how little they do know.<br /><br />  Then &quot;Arten&quot; goes on a list of predictions, that some are not predictions at all since the book was released after some of these events or societal trends happened. Other parts are just speculation that can't be proven or unproven.<br /><br />  It also doesn't take an &quot;ascended master&quot; to understand that we will have a water problem in the future. People have been making some very thought provoking documentaries on the subject for quite sometime with shocking facts about water consumption and corporations involvement in this around the world. Take a look at Bechtel-The World Bank, and the Bolivia water riots for example.<br /><br />  Now we get to the real junk food for the mind! 9/11 conspiracy theories. It seems that &quot;A&amp;P&quot; have been watching documentaries like &quot;Loose Change&quot; and &quot; In Plane Sight&quot;, ( Admittingly, I also saw these some years back), I think &quot;A&amp;P&quot; also watched various YouTube clips and listened to people like Alex Jones.<br /><br />  This section is awkward and clumsy. It ends almost as quickly as it begins. It just seems to be a wayfor Gary to voice his own beliefs about 9/11, using the mouthpieces of &quot;A&amp;P&quot; to do so. Of course the reason given in the book is forgiveness. Yet this doesn't really make sense. So to forgive the events of 9/11 itself, it is essential to shift the blame from being the characters of Middle Eastern Terrorists to the possibility that it is the characters of CIA government agents? This makes no sense as this only shifts the guilt from one set of people to another set of people and is hardly the Truth that shall set you free.<br /><br />  Remember in the introduction to the book that it said this book is about &quot;real&quot; spirituality and not the self help movement that has been passed off as real? Well here we come to the part of the book that is obviously the self help section. This section is so poorly written and so vague, that I cannot help but to think that the following topics were discussed simply as a segue to Gary's &quot;wave of the future&quot; vitamins.<br /><br />  I think ironically, had another teacher or even course teacher written this section, people would be screaming, &quot;Making the body real! Making the body real!&quot; Though I guess if Gary makes disclaimers before writing something, it is somehow different.<br /><br />  The advice given is so common sense and elementary that I have seen better articles written on the subject in my wife's trendy magazines.<br /><br />  First, Gary is told to go for walks. Really? It has been known for years that walking is one  of the best exercises for someone to do and is recommended that people walk for 30 minutes continually a day. This is beyond basic advice.<br /><br />  Then Gary is told that whenever he thinks about it, to take a deep breath. Wow, what vague advice.<br /><br />  It has been well documented that people living in western society tend to breathe up in their chest, taking quick shallow breathes. This exacerbates stress as the sympathetic nervous system is engaged resulting in the fight or flight response.. Even when told to take a deep breath, people tend to attempt this by chest breathing. Better advice rather than whenever you think about it, one should regularly practice breathing techniques such as the Yogi Complete Breath or Qigong dan tien breathing. Learning to breathe from the diaphragm rather than from the chest.  Then if one wants to, they could move onto more advanced pranayama breathing exercises. This not only clears out the diaphragm, but the mind and chi or prana in the body.<br /><br />  And of course he is told to stretch, getting some sun, eat your fruits and vegatables, and drinking fruit and/or Noni juice, etc. Are these really &quot;ascended masters&quot; bestowing us with this wisdom of the times or is this someone's mother giving the reader the most basic, generic advice possible?<br /><br />  Gary's &quot;ascended masters&quot; tell him that it's OK to do yoga even though it makes the body real.  In Western society, yoga has been a craze for sometime. There is yoga for abs, yoga for the back, yoga for weight loss, etc. Essentially Western society focuses on the posture aspect of yoga, but this is not the original purpose of yoga and is certainly not yoga itself. It is only one aspect of yoga.<br /><br />  To state that yoga makes the body real, is to state that this is its purpose, but that is not its purpose.  True yoga was always aimed at recognizing oneself as that which is eternal, infinite, and unchangeable.<br /><br />  The course teaches that we are not a body, but it also states that while in the physical realm, we have a body, and to deny this is an unworthy form of denial.<br /><br />The aim of the  postures (asana) in Patanjali Yoga for example, is actually used as a way to dis-identify with the body, because it helps ease discomforts and pain, which can cause the mind to become preoccupied with the body. The more preoccupied the mind is with this, the more the mind identifies itself as a body. Thepostures are merely a stepping stone for the mind to actually begin to dis-identify itself as a body . Yet, without breath work (pranayama) and meditation (dhyana), yoga is merely relegated to a mere exercise, instead of a spiritual practice that aims to &quot;Know Thyself&quot;.<br /><br />  Unfortunately, Gary's &quot;ascended masters&quot;  seem to have the same ignorant perception of what yoga is as a lot of westerners do. I think Gary should have done his homework before making such a flippant remark about something he doesn't really know all that much about.<br /><br />  Gary's &quot;ascended masters then tell Gary that in the 20 years since they met, Gary hasn't aged. Seriously? This is something that Gary has been saying for years now. I don't know if he's trying to convince himself or his fans. I hate to break it to Gary, but it is quite obvious that he has aged. Anyone can look at his picture from his first book and compare them to present day pictures to see the obvious here. What I don't understand, since it is obviously not true, is why is Gary so bent on trying to convince his readers that his body hasn't aged? Why the emphasis on bodily appearances, especially when comparing pictures within a 20 year span it is quite apparent that Gary's claim is absolutely and undeniably false?<br /><br />  I then get to read Gary tell me about dolphins as if he were explaining this to a 5 year old who just watched  an episode of Animal Planet. This tone continues as he talks to &quot;A&amp;P&quot; about the course. It is just the same repeated formulaic points that he made in his first book, his 2nd book, and even earlier in this book and I just feel like Gary is talking to a child with these contrived conversations meant to seem organic.<br /><br />  The thing about Gary's books, is that he seems to think that if he prefaces any discussions with the disclaimer about not &quot;making it real&quot;, that somehow what he says is more spiritual than other authors andspiritual paths. Yet, reading his books, it is quite obvious that he is &quot;making it as real&quot; as anyone else, if we're even going to use such a term.  People seemed to be so concerned about looking spiritual, that making disclaimers such as &quot;not making it real&quot; followed by doing just that are amusing.<br /><br />  And of course, Gary mentions his current wife who will be his/her future husband, and how his ex-wife will be his/her future 1st husband who is killed, etc. etc. This is just more distracting sensationalized irrelevant soap opera junk food for the mind to grab onto and devour.<br /><br />  And of course, Gary's &quot;ascended masters&quot; cleverly open the door for Cindy to write a book in the future too. So stayed tuned for that.<br /><br />  The bottom line, either Gary doesn't even care anymore or he has run out of clever stories to tell.<br /><br />  It's the same old song and dance. The movie projector analogy (that is often attributed to Wapnick, but I have read books from Ramana Maharshi using this analogy). The emphasis that other teachers don't get it. The emphasis that other paths don't get it.  This nonsense that &quot;Arten and Pursah&quot; are really the Holy Spirit.  Heaven is even once again compared to an orgasm. He couldn't write the book on his own. He's a victim. He's such a good course student. He's so popular. He's Thomas. He's only one a few actually teaching the course, etc. etc. etc.<br /><br />  If one is looking for an answer to life, this book is not it, though that is certainly the claim.  This is honestly one of the worst &quot;spiritual&quot; books I have read and I have read a lot of them. It's poorly written, it veers off into Sci-fi, and takes on conspiracy theories as absolute facts. It's exceptionally boring in other parts, and it attempts to exalt Gary and A Course in Miracles over other paths, which is something that is antithetical to the course's teachings. Gary either tries to dumb himself down and/or the reader down to give the appearance his &quot;ascended masters&quot; are far more wise than they actually are, because their &quot;wisdom&quot; is rather superficial.<br /><br />  We live in a fast food culture, but A Course in Miracles is not McSpirituality.  As a society, if people don't understand something right away or get results right away, they look to short cuts. They look for someone to explain it to them, and then accept and adopt the 2nd hand explanations as &quot;truth&quot;. The course is not Truth, it is only attempting to point the way. Gary's explanations aren't truth. They're essentially regurgitated Wapnick's CURRENT interpretations simplified.<br /><br />  Everyone interprets the course, because everyone reads the course through one's own perception and perception IS interpretation. It is essential that people understand that everyone interprets the cours, otherwise, just like criticisms of organized religion, people will claim dogmatic and fundamentalist ideas that only they are teaching this or that. Dogma can infiltrate &quot;unorganized spirituality&quot; as easily as organized religion. It is very apparent if one steps back and uses a little discernment and critical thinking that these dogmatic ideas are already in Gary's books in the guise of forgiveness.<br /><br />If one sees the course as their path and want to understand the course. Then read the course. Then re-read it, and read it again and again. Meditate on it. Ask your Inner Teacher for guidance as to what a passage means. You may not grasp it right away, but when you do, it will be a much deeper experience than a 2nd hand explanation of another's interpretation.<br /><br />Eric

0743435729|4.0|Alright, now that you've read 'On Basilisk Station', this picks up sometime later. Honor Harrington is an experienced, confident Captain, listening to Admiral Courvosier, who has an assignment. Their enemy, the powerful People's Republic of Haven, fuels its' economy by taking over star systems and plundering their wealth. Intelligence from Yeltsin's Star system thinks Haven wants them next. That isn't the only friction; locally, two religious groups fell out long ago, and the moderates exiled the reactionary wing to a different planet named Masada. That did not stop periodic wars. Now, Manticore is sending a Naval/ Diplomatic mission to this paradise. He is speaking:<br />'... \\"It's a hell of a mess, Honor, and I'm afraid our own motives aren't as pure as the driven snow. We need a forward base in that area (planet Grayson). Even more importantly, we need to keep Haven from securing one that close to us. Those factors are going to be as obvious to the locals as they are to us, so we're bound to get involved in the local conflict, in a peacekeeping role at the very least. If I were the Grayson government, that would certainly be the point I'd insist on, because the basic credo of Masadan theology is that someday they will return to Grayson in triumph and cast down the heirs of the ungodly who exiled their forefathers from their rightful home....'<br />Even Grayson, the moderate planet, denies women the right to vote, own land, or inherit. So feudal.<br />'...\\"And that, Honor, is why you need to know exactly what's going on, diplomatically speaking, on this little jaunt. You're going to be very, very visible, and the fact that the Kingdom is sending a woman to command the military side of the mission, well-\\"<br />\\"I see, Sir,\\" she said softly. \\"I see, indeed.\\" (p. 18-19)<br />This will demand someone serve as a shield to Grayson.
B009WUBERW|4.0|it is a great action movie with a lot of entertainment value for the whole family. Although  the stars have been around for a time they still provide a the a great story line and interaction to keep the suspense through out the entire movie.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|My son has been on about two dozen pretty hairy assignments. He and his colleagues had a problem with this book. They are obligated to secrecy and this book broke the code. I bought it before I knew that and was surprised by the flack I got. But once I get past that, this book was a very good read.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|What a book!  What a guide to find your place, your way, and your purpose in this life.  It is refreshing, eye opening, simple and yet profound.  I enjoyed the self-deprecating humour of the author, the witty way she writes about hard to believe concepts, and the simplicity with which she convinces us that life is here to be enjoyed, to be lived to the fullest, and that everything we need to do just that is all around us in what Starwars fans would recognize as \\"the force\\", or, as she puts it, a free unlimited energy buffet for everybody (or so).  Loved this book, an absolutely necessary read!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I could not put this book down. It was a new dystopian twist, very convincingly portrayed. I am looking for more from Hugh Howey.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I wouldn't have EVER in a million years expect to read this about Kaleb! I'm sooooo in love with him now! He doesn't just have a heart, he has a humongous one! Great story! EXCELLENT!  I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The part I hated the most was finishing it!
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|This is a good free game I haven't purchased anything and  I am on level 7. A good game to play while getting your oil changed.
B00FK04RCW|5.0|I am such a huge fan of this artist, and this album. Where Birch channeled 70's lite-fm in her debut four years ago to incredible artistic success, we find her diving into her inner Tori Amos with a dash of David Bowie (see Superstars). The lyrics are deeply personal and the melodies are superbly crafted and accessible. The production is much more electronic than her previous offerings, which lends a haunting, ethereal quality to the 16 song set (5 bonus tracks!) While her music may inspire you to dust off your turntable and give vinyl another shot (I bet this album sounds incredible on vinyl!), she is neither old-fashioned nor derivative. She is a classically contemporary artist that demands to be heard. Give this album a chance, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Standout tracks: Superstars, Love & War, Frozen Over, Unfkd, Hold On A Little Longer, Truer Than Blue... basically, almost every track is a standout.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addicting love it tried it on my comoyter and sa I d ok when I got the kindle ir was not on yet. After that it did come I am hooked.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Not a good version of Candy Crush.  This game is boring and slow.  The android version is much more fun and challenging.
0790731479|5.0|One of my favorite movies since it first came out. My kids loved it too. Now my grands love it too.
B009GED3HS|5.0|HIMYM has been my favorite tv show ever since season one.  It continues to be clever, witty, and lighthearted, while still maintaining a serious story line that is continuous and riveting!
B008JFUPK8|3.0|I hated the start of this movie. Everything was too computer generated and unrealistic with how it all played out. Apparently on Kripton if you do something bad they spend TONS of manpower, money, energy, and time on putting people into ice crystal things and rocketting them into space. All I could think was how annoying that must be for the people of Kripton who would most likely be saying \\"Why can't we just put them in a cell and have them walk there? It would save money and resources.\\" The worst part is that they send the criminals into space just before the planet dies making sure they are the only ones who live. What was the point of that? Just keep them on the planet so they die with everybody else. And let's not forget that those scenes lasted for over TWENTY MINUTES! I missed the very end of the movie because I just got tired of sitting there for so long watching such a long movie. They really could have cut that first part down by a lot!<br /><br />So it was a very long and dramatic lead up to superman arriving on Earth, but then they just SKIP OVER his arrival and have him as a grown up. They do some flash backs of when he was a kid though. I wouldn't mind if they skipped over his arrival if they didn't just spend over 20 minutes building up to that point.<br /><br />I did like Lois and her tracking back his deeds and find out who he was. It was always unrealistic that somebody like Lois would not be able to figure out who superman really was so PROPS to that.<br /><br />I didn't like how superman STOLE clothes. Superman wouldn't do that. He could have just ASKED for some clothes. Superman is an honest and good guy with strong moral character .. that's why people love him, not just because he has powers. He's not a thief. He also would have cared about the MASSIVE destruction that went on with the over the top fight scenes. This movie seemed to be made for video game fans or something.
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|I can't decide what to think of this book. I need to read his history of Islam to decide if he has a negative bias regarding Christ. I am not a believer of the ridiculous version of events in the Bible. I am also very skeptical of the Koran. The writer still sounds overly disparaging of Jesus. On the positive side, I did learn a lot about the historical sequence of events of a very tumultuous era.
B00CDBZ6NA|3.0|Hard to believe no one accidentally started that thermo nuclear war.  This book is loaded with three letter acronyms so you need to have a good memory as to what each one is. Well written, scary in so much as the people who had control had very little self control and if it had ever started it was unstoppable. Worth the time to read it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|so awesome very fun new fun and exciting levels and features so awesome not much else tho say fun just continues
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|great addictive game, but Jesus do they ask for money. at the end of every failed level. it gets annoying
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I can't stop playing this game. I am a hunter in real life so this is really fun when I am not hunting. This game has decadent graphics and is really fun. I just wish it had unlimited energy.
B000FBJHT4|4.0|&#34;The Day After Roswell&#34; is well-written and thought-provoking. The author claims first-hand experience with the physical evidence from the alien crash near Roswell, N.M. In 1947. There has just been too much coverage debunking the crash for you to decidedly believe the author's claims. But it's compelling and makes logical sense. It really makes you think about all of the quantum leaps we've made in technology since the late 40's. Get it and decide for yourself.
B00D02Z1EA|5.0|Rescue & Restore is a perfect album I love the vocals and the guitars on this album are just through the roof on the sound its awesome, the drums are great and the production is awesome to.<br /><br />recommend to any fan m of Christian rock of core metal
006202406X|1.0|I don't know that I have ever reacted so negatively to a book. I went to sleep mad about it, woke up mad about it, and I haven't stopped being mad about it since.<br /><br />Divergent has been one of my favorite books ever since I read it. Insurgent was fine, and I was hopeful that Allegiant would finish out strong, but I can honestly say that I wish that it had ended with Insurgent. From beginning to end Allegiant was a let down - the perspective change, the disconnected new plot that didn't make any sense and had a ton of holes, the needless deaths, and the lack of hope - I was depressed the WHOLE TIME I WAS READING THIS. I like a good depressing book, but this just felt like a let down. Even depressing books have some happy parts.
B009LOJK1Q|4.0|Another great book from Stephen King.  Kept me totally enthralled from start to finish. Loved the characters who were so believable and courageous but magical at the same time. Anyone who loved The Shining needs to read this - can't wait for more from Stephen King!
B0014BY72Q|5.0|I can't believe I'd never seen it before. If, like me, you're considering watching Star Trek or SG-1 for the umpteenth time--and you've never seen Logan's Run, do yourself a favor and watch it.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Having previously only used the Wii to access Netflix and after a somewhat clunky first couple of attempts to get my phone to talk to the dongle, I am pleased with the set up. I don't have blazing fast DSL but it seems to stream the HD just fine. Way better interface than the Wii and HD!
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|Very pretty scenes with lots of Oz-like color, but boring plot line and VERY slow moving.  Maybe young kids would like it?
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham got me again.  Be prepared to stay up all night; once you read the first page, you will not be able to put it down!<br /><br />As the story begins to develop, Grisham has you guessing how Jake Brigance, the brilliant young lawyer that came into his own in &#34;A Time to Kill&#34;, could possibly lose his case.  Quickly blindsided by personalities and circumstances that turn the table, &#34;Sycamore Row&#34; reveals the depth of racial inequalities in the South that existed well into the 20th century.  The race toward a horrifying climax will keep you spellbound.

B0010T0OCY|4.0|This was one of those movies I had almost forgotten. It is dark, sci-fi, bizarre, and unique...I'm sure many concepts have been stolen since it was made...but for its time it was unlike anything else out there. Good movie and Im super glad to add it to my collection.
B007VDN1PA|3.0|I just received this today and have scanned about 80 slides and some negatives.  I am pleased so far.  I need to experiment more to get the lighting correct, but also can do that on the computer.
B000PC0U1W|5.0|I was hesitant to see this movie because of all the political hype and comparisons to then current presidents and so forth...I was stupid to read the news.<br /><br />This is a GREAT movie. The plot has NOTHING to do with current politics and is set in the past in a dark dystopia with a riveting story all its own. The performances are fantastic. Think The Phantom of the Opera with a Zorro complex!

B0086700CM|5.0|My son has played this game at Dave and Busters and when he saw hi friend with it, he had to have it too. The game is interesting and  fun to play.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Can play this game for hours.  My 9 year old loves it keeps him busy at docs or traveling on the road very happy with this game
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My son played this on his friends tablet and loved it so so much he had to have it too! Fun to play!
B00933JL0A|4.0|A surprisingly addictive game. I never thought a game on a mobile phone could hold my attention for that long. Best of all it has lower cost than other games of this type. A worthy purchase!
B008Y7FQ6E|5.0|Great movie if you like suspense and a little New Orleans dark and mysterious culture !!  Several twists & turns you won't expect.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is a very fun game! I like the interactive fun of it all. I would recommend that everyone should try this game!!! I like having different scenes &amp; the different ways of showing the hidden objects.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|finally I've been waiting for this i have it o was my phone but ive wanted it on my kindle and I'm not disappointed worth the wait
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Played the other ones and hoped I would like this and I luv it.  Keeps you on yours toes lol.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Really, really enjoyed this series....Not sure completely happy with the ending, but it was a logical one....almost as good as hunger games....
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|That kind of book that leaves you at the edge throughout. There was not a single moment I got bored or annoyed. The plot is intrinsically sew and the characters are mysterious, complex and human with all the flaws and weaknesses that comes with it as well as the good parts too. Ryan's writing is top-notch, the plot is very intense... can barely wait for the next books!
B00CS74W0C|5.0|I loved these books, they were much better then 50 shades and they were written first.  I wish they would do a movie on this series instead of 50 shades.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Simple to use. I love utilitarian items, and this is a staple for anyone who wants just that in a tool such as an alarm clock!
B000FA5SMK|5.0|This was my second Corey book.I am a historical fiction reader. Tried demille. Another Corey book. Just OUTSTANDING. Good detective stuff with mucho humor. Ready now for numero 3
B008Y212PI|3.0|Okay, not totally mindless, but just one step up. Easy and relaxing, for those of us who don't like games that much in the first place.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have been playing this for over a year, works great on both kindle fire and Fire HD. I have never had any problems with it. Graphics are great and even the background music is nice.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed both the pace and the characters of the book.  If you enjoyed mr rollin's earlier Sugma Force Novels you'll enjoy &#34;The Eye of God&#34;
B00BKZUVGM|5.0|This was a fantastic conclusion to the trilogy. I feel like it nicely tied off any loose ends or questions that were left in insurgent while making me laugh and cry, often at the same time. Whenever my students ask me for a book recommendation I always ask them if they have read divergent and I am not regretting getting them hooked.
1250038820|5.0|I'm a native New Yorker and this book captures exactly what is beautiful about New York - it's people and their stories. It captures how this city is a melting pot of so many people. The book is beautifully crafted - such a great idea to have a hard cover and the quality of the pages is outstanding! In love with this book!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Dr  Who all the way... awesome, great story line can't wait to see what happens next..  bring John Barrowman back cool
B007FEFLTO|4.0|It was remarkable and hammy that so many historical occurance of major importance were initiated by characters in this book. It was also too much of a love story. It was, however, interesting reading/
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I have never felt so hard at a book. This series is extremely unique. It will be remembered forever. Now to catch my breath!
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|He always makes a great show of issues that are important. Michael Moore shows the underside of healthcare in the U.S. as compared to Socialized medicine. Which is better?  The one that makes you well!!!
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|Michael Douglas was good with the role of Liberace.  The production qualities of this movie are fabulous!  You get a sense of the star and his dual life.  Radiance of a movie.  Great performances.  Enjoy!
B000002N3N|4.0|Any fans of Enya will enjoy this newest addition to her collection. This was purchased as a gift for my wife. She enjoys listening to it during quiet time with the kids.
B000V07IVS|4.0|Mravinsky conducted Tchaikovsky's music in a very authoritative and dynamic way. I was really surprised and disappointed to find out that his Beethoven was soft and a little flat.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been playing for a while and was so excited it is finally available for m kindle! It is addictive!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast by Google is probably the best thing I ever purchased. I use it everyday and it makes my life so much easier. No need for cables to watch Netflix anymore. I'm shocked more people don't own one. I think most people don't realize you can use it on android or apple products. I love it.
B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|Movie was very good - hard to watch, because it's so sad in so many places.  But the sound quality of the stream was poor.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Seems to be working fine. Don't know if you have to try to get lives yet.<br />Can't say too much more.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|I bought the book because of the movie.  It's even better than the movie itself.<br /><br />There's a lot of details that the left out in the movie that was in this book.<br />Great read, plus it's shorter and easy to read.  If you're a baseball fan, you have to buy this book.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Well written book that stands alone. However, it is the perfect sequile to The Shining. I liked it very much.
B009V0TV6O|2.0|On my s4, this page installs &quot;creative metronome free&quot;. Reading reviews, I deleted and reinstalled.  Free version again.  Hopefully it does the job. &quot;
B00358ESI4|4.0|Great acting and quite good special effects.  Story done well and easy to follow.  However, the undertone of anti-war is continually present.
0142424277|5.0|I love these classic books.  The bindings are so colorful and sturdy.  Not only wonderful stories for children but beautiful on the bookshelf.
B00EMJD6TC|4.0|That said? This is a damn good zombie movie. Yes the last third is clearly an add on and yes the resolution method is stupid and illogical but the rest of the movie, the casting, performances, and production value make up for it. I bought Max Brook's books first edition and have recommended WWZ to college professors and had them take he suggestion and thank me for it. I love the books dearly but I don't mind that this is not the book, it never could be.<br /><br />Until HBO or someone goes full out for a miniseries with the kind of punch of casting, heart, devotion, and funding of GoT nothing will be.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Love the 30 Day Shred video for quick workouts. The different levels are great and challenging. Good addition to gym or any home routine.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I really like this game. I think that the gifts you should get to store along with the lives. You can only have 5 lives at a time. If you accept them from. Friends you lose all of them but 5. The gifts do not move to the next level and beyond. It would be nice to use those on the new level you accomplished to get to. I hope the developers read these comments. If this game was improved I would give more stars.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I got this Cromecast thing because I love to watch You-Tube videos on my big tv and it works good. Love that I can watch them and still can work at the same time with my tablet or pc. Only had a little work setting up witg my tv and laptop but after that no problems.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Never disappointed by a John Grisham book. One page in and the characters came back to life. Looking forward to the movie one day.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i  watched  my  mom  forever  telling  her  that  i  want  it  sooooo  bad  now  i  geuss  i  got  lucky  and  i  never  cost  any  thing  to  get  it  i  love  free  apps
B00992CF6W|5.0|An amazing game for  building. They should have new pictures on the slideshow because the graphics have been updated as well. Basically what im saying is that it is better than it looks haha
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was a proper celebration of life and love. I thoroughly enjoyed this book , and people of all ages will too.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Although the some parts were a little hard to understand, the movie was very entertaining. The acting was good, but not excellent. It was good enough to a point where it was convincing. However the story was hard to keep up with a tad bit. This is a movie where you might have to rewatch it a one or two times to fully understand it. Other than that, I liked the moral of story. It is definitely worth watching.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Free version has so much awesome things to do but make a spinner so you can get coins and prizes. But other than that awesome.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Love Nathan Fillion, so I started watching Firefly. But as I watched, I was impressed by the outstanding cast members too. Every one was great--even though most of them I had never seen before this show. This is a show set in the future, but the storyline and human interaction was very realistic.  I just wish there was another season of it, so they could show what happens to the various characters.
B006M4F67A|1.0|I ordered 247 Mahjong but never received it on my Kindle. I received a game that I did not order and deleted it. Please sent 247 Mahjong.  Thank you.
0756407915|5.0|The title says it all. As for the book itself, I'm not done with it, but it's great so far - has really pulled me in.
B004LUS390|5.0|How am I supposed to draw well on a touch pad. It's a good app but the touch pad is so much trouble.
0143039431|5.0|I bought it for my grand son and he loves it.it's a very interesting book for any grand parent to give to a grand child.
0553805460|5.0|Amazing insights to Jordan's life and that of a very wealthy person.  Couldn't put the book down.  Just a shame about how much of it was made.  Looking forward to reading the next book.
B00CHILW64|5.0|This is a brutal flick that makes you feel as if you were actually swept away with the characters in the Tsunami.  Very realistic. Very scary. Very worth watching in order to have a better understanding of the tragedy that most of us only saw in the news on TV.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|This game is so awesome cause u get to go in army bases<br />Fly helicopters tanks and lot of cool stuff plus u get keys for<br />box's  that u get stuff
B008AIGWVA|2.0|Since it was free, I wasn't expecting much. It was better than the cat that uses the shower, etc., but not by much. Add having the dog mix chemicals isn't really what we want to be showing little kids, is it?
B00F35BV64|2.0|The writing for this was horrible. So unfocused and corny. Really disappointed in this movie as its over production doesn't save it from the bad writing. Amid all the fine special effects there lies a poorly executed story that can't even support the special effects. Most of the characters are human yet gravity and basic laws of physics seem not to apply to them. Booooooooo,
B009V0TV6O|5.0|To quote some of the other reviewers, &quot;Waaaaahh...  I demand more for nothing because you've always giving me something for nothing...&quot;  While these reviewers would make good voters for the Communist Party, their reviews lack any real substance.  Also, I received the paid app upon download - no need to restart the device either - Kindle Fire HD.<br /><br />The app forces landscape orientation.  The UI Is not so clear as to be immediately discernible, but it's not so bad that I couldn't figure it all out  in about two minutes.  It is full of features, including a tap to tempo button, various rhythms, it displays the musical names of the tempos, and more.  Most importantly, it appears to keep time well.<br /><br />If it were my app, I'd tweak the UI for appearance and ease of use, but considering all the features and the apparent reliability of the app, it still gets five stars.
B00DMEQP46|4.0|MGMT's third, self-titled album, is quite good, but then so were their first two albums. Always creative, always pushing sonic boundaries, yet still retaining a 60's/70's/80's aesthetic that is familiar yet strange all the same.<br /><br />The funny thing is I could never really get into The Flaming Lips or Mercury Rev (two bands MGMT is often compared to). But, there's something likeable and more interesting to me in MGMT's music/lyrics. There is no radio station for me because I listen to such a wide variety of sounds that I don't fit neatly into any music listening audience demographic. MGMT is one of those bands that defies categorization. They can be catchy or discordant, sly or direct, serious or humorous--all in one album.<br /><br />The first six tracks are great: 'Alien Days', 'Cool Song No. 2', 'Mystery Disease', 'Introspection (cover song)', 'Your Life Is A Lie' and 'A Good Sadness' all flow together seamlessly, creating a solid music listening experience. Then, they hit a rough patch with 'Astro-Mancy' which just (even with repeatedly listening) comes off like a glob of sound. Again, with repeated listening, 'I Love You Too, Death' at first is the same, but then materializes as a more cohesive track. Still, placing them side by side in the track order throws the flow off a bit. This is regained later with 'Plenty Of Girls In The Sea' and then once again, lost with the closing track 'An Orphan Of Fortune'.<br /><br />It seems to me that each MGMT album has a few tracks that just prevent it from earning five stars. The band continues to evolve without establishing clear directives, but they have yet to hit their stride. I believe with a little more focus they could rise to the next level. All the potential is written into their first three albums. Look at Kings Of Leon or Coldplay or even U2 or R.E.M. You can hear the seeds of their future greatness in their first few albums.<br /><br />If alternative radio demographics were to select three 'hits' from this album I could see them being 'Your Life Is A Lie' which was the second single, 'Introspection' and 'Alien Days' the first single. Although I think 'Cool Song No. 2', 'Mystery Disease' and 'Plenty Of Girls In The Sea' are close behind.<br /><br />It would be cool to see these guys work with different producers such as Brian Eno, Daniel Lanois, Ric Ocasek, David Byrne, Brian Wilson, Trevor Horn, Steve Lillywhite, etc. It would be interesting to see how different producers would affect the duo's sound.<br /><br />Here's how MGMT compares with MGMT's previous works:<br /><br />2007 Oracular Spectacular: Four Stars<br />2010 Congratulations: Four Stars<br />2013 MGMT: Four Starss album I could see them being 'Your Life Is A Lie' which was the second single, 'Introspection' and 'Alien Days' the first single.

B00BD99JMW|4.0|Wonderful series. Great character development. A piece of you will live & die with this story. It left me comparing the fragile balance and prejudices of our own society.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I greatly enjoy this game when it's not bugging the faction contributions and wars.  PvP battles are fun and challenging.
B00FPH6A70|1.0|i dont know what movie y'all were watching, those of you that gave it a 5 star rating!  it took all my strength to watch this movie til the end cuz it was boring and stoooooopid!
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I am a fan of &#34;Walking Dead&#34;. And the zombies from WWZ is so much more advanced than the zombies from &#34;Walking Dead&#34;.
B00G6Q29KQ|5.0|Outmove proves to be the climax of a series of shocking yet entertaining adventures in a realm that isn't here and now. If you've followed Brandt Legg from 'Outview' to 'Outin', you'll already be excited about this 3rd instalment in the Inner Movement series. This is where the real adventure begins...<br /><br />If this is the first time you're reading Brandt Legg, then get prepared to have your mind blown away because you're about to delve into a dangerous world that feels realer than your own very existence!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A can't put it down read!  All the things you'd want in a good read told from a very unique perspective. And all the while hoping that good guys and good dogs don't finish last.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Nicely woven -- I loved the way each story interconnected with the others--like the fibers of a spider web !
0062278096|4.0|Although neither in-depth nor serious, this is an amusing guide to the Sherlock Series (1 & 2).  Great pictures, silly post-it notes, & trivia scattered throughout.  No serious analysis on the series, but a fun read.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Even better than &#34;The name of the wind&#34;. Since I started reading it, I couldn't stop. Waiting for the next from Patrick Rothfuss
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|It's still a little odd with the new characters, but I was reasonably pleased. I still don't think it is a really one of those movies I can watch over and over, and that is KEY for me
B00DVPN30A|5.0|Simply put, Amos is a treasure and I never get tired of listening to his music. Why do people seem to want him to sound the same as he did on Supply & Demand?? No change and no growth = boring! If you get the chance, be sure to see him live. I have done so 4 times and each time was truly great.
B00D7OMNXS|3.0|Don't get me wrong, great movie. What I look for in a movie is more than that. Re-watchability. I don't like the idea of buying 400 movies and just having them sit there, I like to know I could go back to it in a few months
B00BD99JMW|5.0|There's action, like any other book in this series. But let's just say this is the \\"Mockingjay\\" of the Divergent Series.
0395389496|4.0|If you know the story, then there is no surprise but the illustration really allows you to be involved with the story.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Why couldn't it have ended on a happy note. Stressful and so sad. I hate how the story turned out in the end. Wishing I didn't read this one.
020530902X|4.0|If the truth be known I failed English grammar in high school.  Everyone knows the saying, &#34;If I only knew then what I know now.  I would have paid more attention.&#34;  I am now a college student writing papers for classes and I have found The Elements of Style to be a quick help guide to writing better papers.  Professor William Strunk, Jr. put a tag on his book calling it, &#34;the little book.&#34;  And it is only 105 pages including forwards, table of contents and index.  Well worth the price and the time to improve your writing.  I would not consider &#34;the little book' a page turner but a solid reference.  I have read the book cover to cover but now that I know what is contained in the book, use it as a reference almost every day.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This is an awesome game. I mean,It is very relaxing,but I kinda wish some of the dragons didn't cost gems. But otherwise good.
B009V0TV6O|4.0|Haven't tried the on my phone yet, but it's a neat little metronome with several presets. Easy to set up and adjust. Different sounds. I had the Tempo Metronome Free version, and it works well enough, but this has some nice added extras. Great idea for a FAOTD for musicians, or budding musicians. :)
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game, it is really adictive. I can not stop playing it. I really love this game. It is awesome
B000LXQVA4|3.0|6 month old has had it for a month and enjoys it- can occupy herself up to an hour if she's in the mood.  Biggest concern is that she'll sway back and forth, smacking the plastic seat into the poles and she could really smash her fingers between them while doing so- I've padded the &#34;corners&#34; of the seat and will soon add foam padding to the poles too.  I'm know it was more intended for bouncing, but trying telling a baby that. The posts could stand to be more stable- I don't think it's dangerous but could cut down on the clattering.  The hinged bottom is pretty much useless- the seat doesn't fold up vertically so undoing it only gains you a few inches of space.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I just love this game it is so fun and I just can't stop playing it! I know that others like this game too.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|When I bought this book, I thought I might be reading it in segments, with other reads in between. Instead, I don't want to put it down. The history that used to confuse me is now making sense. As a native of Illinois, Mr Lincoln has always had a fascination for me. We have been to the new museum in Springfield, and now I will need to go back to get a better picture of everything that is there. Can't wait to finish. Thanks to Ms Goodwin for all of her efforts and skills.
1455113549|5.0|Great book to hear in the car on a long trip.  Plot grabs you right away.  The one reading to you reads well with lots of inflection. My husband and I had our own mini book group discussion between CDs, and he isn't really a big reader. Travel time flew by for both of us.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A very good, fast paced read. Anastasia really comes into her own. Together, she and Christian really start to move forward. A highly enjoyable book.
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|The acting is pretty bad but the story is compelling and at the end of an episode, you are anxious for another.  My husband thought it was stupid.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have read most of Stephen King's books, this one brought me back to his earlier writings.  Once I started reading I couldn't put it down.
076115678X|3.0|This is a good reference book to ready for curly girls.  It is nice to have all of the info in one place but there isn't anything earth shattering.  I started following the recommended cleansing method and didn't really see a difference in my hair.  You can get the same information on sites like naturallycurly.com.
B001GXF2YY|4.0|You can't go wrong reading a Connelly novel, and this is no exception.  The story also provides some insight into Bosch's marriage and it's subsequent failure.
B00FRMCYQ4|5.0|Kids loved it and were laughing and giggling the whole time.  Having grown up outside the Indy 500, the graphics of the racetrack were GREAT!
B005CVWWJY|3.0|Though &#34;the oldies&#34; things in the book are good, seems like you're reading MMORPG geek's essays. Boy's dreams bla bla bla.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I like this game really well the graphics are pretty good for a kindle game and leveling up is pretty easy too
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Planet Earth is one of the most beautiful documentaries available; in Blu-ray, it is absolutely stunning and definitely worth buying.
B009V0TV6O|5.0|Downloaded the app, got the full version..problem seems to be solved. This is a great metronome app. Strongly suggest watching the demo video. if you do, and the interface is still a mystery, you might want to consider buying a mechanical metronome. The app has some great features that should help you take your playing to a new level. As one who's been a professional musician for longer than most of the readers have been around, I heartily recommend this app!
B006P96PAO|5.0|This a great family for every family, this movie has changed my life alot, i really have to use some patience in my life

B005BRS8Z6|4.0|It is Interesting, easy to understand and apply to daily life journey, supports my personal faith walk as a Christian.
B0047BXRB2|4.0|If you love the 1950's SF scene with it's beginnings of special effects, this movie is tremendously good. Technology was logical, enemy was logical, scenes developed nicely.
0385523394|4.0|This is not the Netfix story, but an honest tale of this woman's experience.  It calls all of us to think more deeply about our feelings about incarceration.  The beginning was a little slow, but you soon find yourself immersed in her daily life.  A good read.
B00A0SICYI|5.0|Classic, family-friendly movie. I watched it with my 2 year old and he loved it. I hadn't seen it in years and actually enjoyed it myself as an adult.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is addictive and lots of fun. Seems to me though, it's a game for women and children not men.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very fun to play.  It is a good puzzle and works your mind.  It is addicting and you just can't put it down!
1401324649|5.0|I enjoyed this book greatly because it let you forget the pettiness of todays life, stimulates your fantasy and exercises your knowledge of history. Wish I could climb out my window... and disappear!
B00E9ZFIMM|4.0|Easy to use, I haven't done much on it yet. So far it is living up to my expectations a place to record what God reveals in His Holy Word.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|The quality of storyline and links to the past make this series an absolute delight for fans of the show. Everything is tied up nicely in the final episodes and the climax to the voyage will leave you with tingles of happiness and a little sadness that nothing was done to keep this ensemble alive on the big screen. It's not too late....
B00G32OER4|5.0|I'm an old man, and don't really scare. This movie has some moments that sent chills up my spine. Awesome flick!
B0089LOG02|5.0|Extremely good read. I never knew this went on. Just talked to someone yesterday whose father a and siblings went through similar things. Highly recommend.
B009X01C64|5.0|nice color ,love it.... ...it feels good ..........it looks good......... its easy too flip and fold in different directions.  the price tho could be a little bit lower.. economy wise
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Yes I lost my original kindle and  was heartbroken as it had been a gift for mothers day several years ago.  Then that lightbulb went off inside my head saying you can download a Kindle reader on both your pc and your android.  Now believe me I am again a happy camper !!!!!!!!!!  Thankyou Amazon for providing me a way to continue reading my books at least until I can save up enough monies for a new Kindle.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|It was the reviews that got me and the huge drama over a key character dying. That spiked my interested like nothing else. Every one was making such a big deal about how horrible it was and so I had to read it.<br /><br />Initially, the only reason I wanted to read the last one was because of the movie hype. Honestly, the second book has so many plot twists and people dying, I really wasn't sure about a third book. What would be talked about?<br /><br />Well Roth did a good job of rounding out the series. Yes, it still felt a little tedious and slow like the second book, but this one wraps everything up. It leaves no questions unanswered, and Insurgent really makes sense now with Allegiant read. Her physiological and gene emphasis definitely makes her series unique in dystopian fiction. What makes it even more amazing is that these are her first books! I am officially jealous.<br /><br />Anyway back to the subject at hand, most importantly the death that had people wailing. Most people will have you believe that it was senseless. It is not. In fact, I must say the best part of the book was the end and the death. The death represents so much--the character's original faction and her adopted one; her journey; forgiveness; victory over fear; and I could go on. Her death is really beautiful and that is why I gave the book a four because the ending was so gut wrenching, but heartwarming. After that moment, events and characters really come full circle. Roth brings you back to the first book and even though that character is gone you can still feel their presence. Sacrifice. Bravery. Love. Hope. That is what this book leaves you with. Then I remembered why I fell in love with the first book so much.
B00973902K|3.0|Pop song that has obviously been a great summer song for all of us to enjoy during our family barbecues.
006202406X|1.0|Terrible ending.  No happiness or hope, just sadness and despair.  This is quite a departure from earlier books where there was the possibility of a brighter future for the characters.  Killing tris at the end leaves an empty hole none can fill.  I will not recommend reading this.
B009VLX8FS|3.0|Great album fro Taylor Swift.  She has clearly created a top song album for all ages to enjoy.  This is my daughters favorite artist and I can see why
B0035QUXWQ|4.0|A touching story of how one intellectually challenged individual comes to touch the lives of others with God's help. Forrest Gump is an inspiring movie that encourages us all to become helpful to our fellow man through grace.

B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Who doesn't love Pendergast?  I thought the book had lots of intrigue and twists and turns.  I thought the Preston came up with a really great plot.  Sometimes it seemed Preston really pushed the envelope with Pendergast's characters abilities.  But overall I loved the book.

1451695195|5.0|Wonderful! Thank you Eben Alexander for writing this book and giving the account of your experience to the world. I've never had an NDE but I can \\"feel\\" the truth of your experience. This is going to be a short review - after all, what can one say?<br /><br />I realize that it's very unlikely the author will read this review but in case he does and for others interested I can thoroughly recommend the recent book by Australian research psychologist Peter Todd called The Individuation of God: Integrating Science and Religion. This book very intelligently and scientifically demolishes the \\"old school\\" mechanistic materialist scientific reductionism beliefs. Note also that Peter Todd was inspired by his life-changing NDE (see page58).<br /><br />And personally another lovely (and practical) book on NDE's and care of the dying is The Art of Dying by Peter and Elizabeth Fenwick.<br /><br />...and thanks again.

B008Y212PI|4.0|I enjoy these kind of puzzles a lot. The app works well and there are a lot of very challenging puzzles. Lose a star for forcing people to review the app in order to get the &quot;loyalty puzzles&quot;. Your app is good enough that you don't need to cheat the review system.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|This was a great series.  The actors were the best and the story even better. There was nudity, but very tastefully done.
B00FLDG5BE|4.0|However, I noticed Quinn Sullivan made it and it is evident that no lime light was shared with him. Where the hell is Mike Zito, from Texas? How about Joe Bonamassa? Did notice that Beth Hart is performing and she is very talented. I'd like to see Quinn Sullivan rip it up with a couple of his new songs from Cyclone and I'm Getting There. Come on, he is 14 and already got there!

B005MLOKXA|5.0|I started watching The Good Wife episodes Season 3, liking it very well; the reason for watching Season 2.<br />Well written, good acting, interesting scripts. Easy to connect with the cast, combining professional and personal attitudes, values, struggles.

B0096MM9GG|3.0|Love the game and the graphics look great on the Fire HDX but, the controls are the worst I've seen on any tablet or phone.  Literally, the right arrow barely works and the left arrow is too close to the edge to be comfortable to use.<br /><br />I was really hoping the game would be more playable as it works 10 times better on the Nexus 7 2013 and while the controls are better on the iPad that isn't up to the Nexus either...  However, the Fire HDX has the worst controls of the bunch, literally almost unplayable.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This was my first Android game.  I enjoyed the game almost as much as a pc version. Will look for more of this type.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|From start to finish its a solid, awesome cd. Heavily based in a more electronic sound it seems Reznor has come full circle with his music. This has been on play sice it came out and I went to see them last Friday in DV where they played about 8 or 9 songs from Hesitation Marks in their 130 minute set. Spectacular!
B00G6Q29KQ|5.0|The third instalment of Brandt Legg's thrilling Inner Movement trilogy doesn't disappoint. Filled with adventure and well rounded characters, &#34;Outmove&#34; takes us on a spiritual journey through time. A wonderful climax to a gripping trilogy as we follow the members of The Inner Movement as they battle against the evil organisation &#34;Omnia&#34;. Beautifully written and packed with unique concepts and riveting action &#34;Outmove&#34; should not be missed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game and have been waiting for a long time for the kindle app.  Now I can play anywhere!
B002FOAVGC|4.0|This movie established Cuaron as a director to watch, and laid the groundwork for his more ambitious &#34;Gravity.&#34;  Same formula:  world-class cinematography and meta themes.  Specifically, the film asks the question, &#34;what would happen if people everywhere stopped having babies? &#34;  And even more deeply, why?<br /><br />Like &#34;Gravity,&#34; though, the script can be a little clunky.  Those shortcomings are smoothed over by a first-rate cast.  All-in-all a thought-provoking film, nicely paced by Cuaron
006202406X|1.0|I have never taken the time to write a review before.  However, the disappointment I felt after wasting my time on this novel compelled me to share my point of view in hopes of saving another person from the same fate.  To be clear, it's not just the ending.  The first two novels were interesting.  The characters were being developed.  You began to have a sense of who they were.  You began to wonder what a society like this would be like (although, I did feel as if the writing was starting to falter a bit by the end of book two).  Then comes Allegiant.  As soon as I realized she was writing the book from both POVs, I knew what she was planning to do.  Even then, I still thought it could work.  Just maybe.<br /><br />However, that thought couldn't have been more wrong.  It felt like the book was written by an entirely different person.  The shifting POVs were confusing because there really wasn't a difference in tone.  She made Tobias seem extremely weak in this book.  Displaying a character's vulnerability is one thing, but that is not what Roth did.  She just made him weak.  In reality, I had a hard time recognizing any of the characters in this book.  They were all flat and one-dimensional.<br /><br />SPOILERS!!!<br /><br />As the book continued, the plot seemed all over the place and extremely contrived at times.  His mother chose him after all the years of planning for power?  After not having any maternal instinct ever?  It didn't feel real.  It felt fake.  Why bring in the fringe for one small job?  Either leave them out or utilize them in a larger capacity.  And, killing Tris. I believe authors have a right to end their stories as they see fit, however, I prefer that the ending makes some sense if I am going to purchase their book and invest my time in it.  Tris's death didn't serve a purpose.  She fulfilled the self-sacrifice theme Roth was beating over our heads just by taking her brother's place without knowing she could survive the death serum. That was enough.  Killing felt like a waste.  Just as it did for Tori.  In my opinion, Roth did it for shock value and to try to prove she was \\"different\\" for Suzanne Collins and J.K. Rowling.  No happy ending hear because I am different.  I will do what no one else did.  That is how the ending felt.<br /><br />Allegiant seemed to be the result of Roth wanting to be done with the series and not putting much thought into how she got there.  The writing was extremely sloppy and boring throughout the book. There was no character development and so many different plots that at times, it felt as if there were no plot at all.  What could have been a good series fell more than short. Disappointing is the best word to describe it.<br /><br />If they chose to make this novel into a movie, I hope the screenwriters do a better job of telling the end of the series.<br /><br />Hopefully in the years to come, Roth will be able to look back and see the potential the series had and how it went unrealized.  It would have taken more courage and skill to allow Tris to live.  To find a life with Tobias.  To find her purpose.  Roth should have taken the Dauntless motto to heart a little more.  Maybe next time Roth.  Be Brave.
076115678X|3.0|The jury is still out on this book.  Still have some unanswered questions. But to be fair I have not read the entire book yet.  It is a quick read. But, life happens.<br />Will submit another review after the 6 weeks or so after to document changes.<br />I have seen a difference in my hair already.<br />I have recommended this to my other natural curly girls in my life.

B00D6DVSAE|5.0|Saw Sting hawking this on the Today Show.  First thought - I loved the Police. Second thought - I wish I didn't know about the tantric thing.  Third thought - OH that is actually great music.  SOLD!  Then I got the CD's and listen every day.  What beautiful stories each song tells.  I can't wait to see the musical.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I have the entire series up to here. Each series ends with a &#34;cliff-hanger&#34; episode and the resolution of the final season 4 episode in season 5-1 was excellent.<br />I'd recommend this seies to anyone who likes mysteries, action and humor. Very entertaining.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|The game is fun to play, but I don't like that it takes so long to gain enough points to purchase the recommended higher power firearms.  If it gets so I cannot take down animals with spending real money to get the higher firepower, I'll stop playing.

B00BD99JMW|4.0|Fans of Divergent and Insurgent, do not be dissuaded.  This is a book that needs to be read, pondered, and processed.<br /><br />Veronica Roth forges a new path in Allegiant and makes some difficult, controversial, and thought-provoking choices.  This is a book that strives to achieve authentic reality, and while I would have wanted her to make different decisions, I think it hits the mark.  But don't be fooled, this book is a whole different beast than Divergent and Insurgent.<br /><br />Allegiant shows a different world - in some ways, less manufactured and in other ways, more so.  The world outside the gates is certainly...different.  And true to character, Tris and Tobias perceive and react to them in different ways.  While Veronica forms this beyond-the-gates world with heavy influences from science fiction and dystopian literature, she manages to reveal the backstory in a refreshing way that parallels how an individual in the 'real-world' would receive information - in pieces and fragments, where the puzzle doesn't always add up.<br /><br />The world Tris and Tobias find themselves in is truly a puzzle, and I found myself, as the reader, wishing they had paid attention to all the pieces.  Yes, I can think of dozens of different ways the story could have gone to satisfy the reader and their desire for escapism.  However, a neat ending, where every puzzle piece has is laid in it's designated place, is not the route Veronica chose to take.  Veronica chose the route which mirrors our true reality: everything is not meant to work out.  Not every situation or relationship has an ending we can accept and understand.  We should all respect her for not choosing the route to easy popularity.<br /><br />As for the dual viewpoints of Tris and Tobias, I agree with many that it was hard to distinguish between the two.  This would be my only criticism of the novel, as I believe a better execution would have allowed the reader to identify with and grow to love Tobias as the narrator.<br /><br />Is it my favorite of the series?  No.  Will I read it again?  Yes.  Because sometimes, a dose of reality (and a chance to re-evaluate our thought paradigms) is what we all need.arrator.<br /><br />Is it my favorite of the series?

B0091REZMW|3.0|I like this game...but it is not so easy for me to understand all that I have to do. I would like more clear instructions for all he areas.<br />I only gave it a 3 because I am not sure if I will figure it out. I do like the hidden objects. Some rooms have better graphics than others...which makes the objects easier to find.<br />I am on  level 13,  and haven't spent any money of my own. This means i only get to play for a few minutes a day. I do not mind the short time play since i haven't paid money...tho it would be nice to play longer. There is no end to the game...which is pretty cool.<br />The other reason i only gave it a 3  is because i do not know if it will be possible to play for free once i reach higher levels.<br />I do not mind paying for games...but i do not like games that don't have a set amount. So far...my patience and willingness to only play for a few minutes per day have allowed me to play for free.<br />I really do love the idea of a game with no end....just not trusting that it wii keep going and for how long at this point.<br /><br />I would rate it a 5 if the directions were clearer. ..and if i knew i could keep playing. But the game itself is good and you can't lose anything if it didn't cost anything!
B000001EGA|5.0|Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy, is definitley eltons best classic albums byfar, from the sound the lyrics i have the vynill<br />album, that i purchased when it first came out, brings back fond memories.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was a book club choice. Something I might not have chosen myself. I loved it because it made you think about your own life. What would you do. I think it deserves five stars. You can really understand the characters.
B00DJZR46G|5.0|The diving board by elton john is an excellent album, it proves that elton is still capable of producing great songs and performances<br />The sound is great, his voice is great and the piano sounds really well.
B003VANOFY|5.0|A great gaming headset that you can use all day and not have to worry about your head or ears hurting.

B004R6JG7Q|5.0|On of the two great auto racing movies of all time.  (the other is Grand Prix)  The racing footage is terrific.  I have been to Le Mans 24 hr events and this movie portrays the amazing sensation of watching the race, grabbing supper, checking out the carnival, watching more racing until you drop, getting a nights sleep, and waking up to cars that are still screaming around until the next afternoon.
B002OMZTSK|5.0|Sometimes Russel made me so mad, I'd have to close my kindle and come back later. It took awhile, but he found his own truth and became the hero. The romantic in me still wishes he'd gotten his man. Can't wait to see the movie .
B00F91H15W|3.0|The movie is more interesting if you watched the E! channel series.  Otherwise, it's a bit boring.  I did like the part about Paris Hilton's house.  I wonder if it really is covered with pictures of her??  I expected a little bit more.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The Shining was one of my favorite King novels. This was a good follow up - what happened to the boy and his mother who survived that night.  I probably would have chosen a different title though.
0316219266|4.0|I've been a customer of Amazon since at least 1998.  I'm a Prime member, have 3 Kindles, and spend hundreds of dollars a month at Amazon.  I worked in the book business for years & remember when Amazon had a huge booth at the American Booksellers Association annual conference.<br /><br />This book gave me pause.  I was fascinated with some of the information in this book on how the company started, the risks they took, the successes and failures.  Anyone interested in technology and how it is changing our lives should read this book.  What concerned me was the disregard of the human element.  Employees and competitors are used and thrown away when not needed.  Yes, the customer is king -- but aren't your employees your customers too? Can't there be a balance work and life?  Can we treat competitors and suppliers fairly?  Are people dispensable as long as they aren't customers?<br /><br />I wish there was more information about the AWS and their cloud computing because I find it so interesting. The changes Amazon has made to our society should have been explored in more depth.  As someone who remembers the first surge of the internet, the success of Amazon is amazing feat.<br /><br />I love Amazon & truly hope it's not the bully that it seems from this book.  Jeff Bezos needs to be considered in the same class as Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and Larry Ellison.  He's changed how we buy things and use the internet.

B00FR3QVW6|5.0|Ben Cooper (aka Radical Face) is easily my favorite musician.  His music is powerful, evocative, deeply moving, \\"spacious\\"--and highly aesthetic.  He is also my favorite songwriter as his lyrics are, without exception, both meaningful and emotionally impacting.  Now, I could have written all of that before this album came out, so I want you to understand my full meaning when I say that I believe this is his best album yet, even taking into account the excellent \\"Electric President\\" albums he released with Alex Kane.<br /><br />This is the second album in a three-album project, \\"The Family Tree.\\"  He drew up a family tree (much of it based on various real genealogy charts) and the songs in the project tell the stories of the people in the family tree through the years--their triumphs and regrets, loves and losses.  Interestingly, there are no names named in any of the lyrics, which makes it possible to draw your own parallels.  The first album is \\"The Family Tree: The Roots,\\" covering the earliest roots of the family, and this second installment is \\"The Branches.\\"<br /><br />Another interesting decision he made was to restrict his instrument repertoire in each album to those which would have been available in the time period covered by that album.  \\"The Roots\\" is therefore much more limited than \\"The Branches\\" in the instruments used, although with post-production and multi-track recordings he still achieved the intricate and professional sound he was going for in both albums.<br /><br />He is very perceivably developing as an artist and the quality of this album is utterly stunning.  This is at the other end of the spectrum from modern electronica/dance songs written and mixed solely for clubbing.  Ben Cooper's music is ethereal.<br /><br />I've listened to this album several times already, and there are actually no weak links.  The stand-out best tracks are \\"Holy Branches\\" and \\"The Mute\\", I'd say, but it's hard to choose just a couple.  After I've listened to it more I'll post an update covering the album track by track.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The arrangements of familiar music is so fresh.  I listen to this album often.  I am a musician also.  I wish I had string players to work with.
B0002FQAZM|5.0|Wow, the best songs on one album. It is not often that I can find one album that has all the songs I like but this one does it. Yes there are some songs I do not like but we all have our own likes and dislikes. C'est la Vie! Hope you find this helpful.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This app really work and it amazing  it take great pictures  i think u should get it if u want to
B005HED11Y|5.0|Season 1 definitely contains some of the classic episodes of the series. However, in the next two seasons it was fascinating to see how the characters/actors learned to play off each other. So while the first season clearly set a very high standard, in my opinion it was exceeded in seasons 2 & 3. Regardless of the season, this is great television, which has truly withstood the  test of time. I enjoyed every minute, and I hope you will too.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I bought this after hearing all the buzz about how fantastic this product was going to be.  Well, After having it a little while, I unplugged it and tossed it.  I didn't get the free Netflix trial either.  Can I get a refund?  There seems to be no support outside of Netflix/Hulu/Youtube, which are things I already had on other devices.
B0018LMZOO|4.0|This is a CD re-issue of their 1972 release. It contains all 8 tracks from the original (Vinyl) release, plus 4 bonus tracks. Along with the CD, you get a great 10-page booklet with photos of the band members, artwork from the original album cover, and extensive liner notes detailing the history of the band. There is also information regarding the recording sessions that yielded this release, as well as the songs lyrics.<br /><br />This was the 7th album release for The Moody Blues and the last one before they took an extended hiatus to work on solo projects. According to the liner notes, the band was overdue for a break from working together when they recorded the songs for this release. That fact isn't obvious when listening to this CD, because all of the songs in this collection are well crafted and carefully performed. While a few of the songs do seem to have a slight sense of weariness \\"Isn't Life Strange\\", and \\"Lost In A Lost World\\" for example, there are others that are light \\"For My Lady\\", playful \\"The Land Of Make Believe\\", and even joyous and celebratory \\"You And Me\\", \\"I'm Just A Singer (In A Rock And Roll Band)\\".<br /><br />The bonus tracks consist of the previously unreleased \\"Island\\", a longer version of \\"Isn't Life Strange\\" that contains a 2-minute instrumental break in the middle (that was edited out for time reasons), an instrumental demo version of \\"Lost In A Lost World\\", and the backing track (no vocals) \\"You And Me\\".<br /><br />Overall, this is another fine collection of songs from the group who has shown us time and again that music for adults doesn't have to be bland or boring. If you are already a Moody Blues fan, then you will want to add this release to your collection. If not, then I suggest you start with their greatest hits package instead.

1623650003|3.0|Requirement #1 for reading this:  Have a very strong stomach because there are loads of stomach turning scenes from beginning to end.<br /><br />Requirement #2:  If you do decide to read it, for crying aloud, read the entire book before judging it!  If you read only the first several chapters, you have no grasp on what it's all about.<br /><br />Requirement #3:  Be prepared not to like anyone in the book, but be open to changing your mind as you progress.<br /><br />Summation: This is a most difficult book to rate.  You might love it.  You might hate it.  It's a tough book and you will need to be a tough reader to get through it.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|First I must say that I am a devoted fan of Dave Eggers and the ways he has elevated and enriched literature for us all.  His \\"Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius\\" actually was just that.  It had depth and characters who, though since it was a fictional work of autobiography tracked as \\"real,\\" and who were so fleshed out that every page turned brought a new level of something important being at stake.<br /><br />Next, I need to tell you that \\"The Circle\\" presents, in a very digestible and too-close-to-home way, what may be the blueprint for our culture, more obsessed with recognition than introspection, irony-free, and trustful of everyone based upon the face value of their statements rather than a questioning of their motives and intentions.  Like some kind of gentle, massaging harbinger of the apocalypse, \\"The Circle\\" may actually be an outline, or even abridged version, not only of \\"The Great American Novel,\\" but also, on its own, it could be one of the most important books written, ever, especially if one rates fiction or nonfiction on the scale of \\"everything is at stake.\\"  This novel does not skimp on that last statement.<br /><br />I wanted to love \\"The Circle,\\" and in some ways do, beyond logic, because since I finished it a few days ago it has haunted every keystroke in my computer, each moment reading a newspaper or blog, viewing TV, contact with people, and has even broken into my dreams.  Eggers has given us a technological horror story, wherein the horror works because it is presented through a character who is the \\"irony free\\" type of person who tends to let technology wash over them completely, without questioning more profound, far reaching ramifications.  But this very device of the naive but powerful, self-enabled character, is also the book's main shortfall.<br /><br />I am frustrated after reading this book, not that its premise disappoints, but rather that its execution leaves so much of the richness of what a novel can and should achieve completely out of the equation.  Instead, I felt as if I were reading a lengthy, detailed treatment for a movie -- and perhaps this was Egger's intention?  Is this a treatment for a 21st century version of the prophetic Orwellian science fiction film \\"Colossus, The Forbin Project,\\" or of Terry Gilliam's \\"Brazil?\\"  Or could it be deeper - that the style of the novel is a sly and subtle comment on our facile, non-reflective, tech-infused culture?  Even if the author pulled one over on me, I still found myself hungry for some of the more grounding techniques of the novel --<br /><br />The \\"surprises\\" of the book - and I am spoiling here - were telegraphed and paid off largely without surprise, except perhaps that the feeling of dread was paid off in ways that abandon all hope.  But again, not at the expense of the HORROR of the world that this book lays out.  Still, though I may have been reduced to pure, comatose inactivity had the Circle actually \\"completed\\" itself in terms of novelistic style, with deeper character motivation/explanation/backstory/follow through, it seems that Eggers has done a disservice to what may have elevated this story into an unassailable \\"Great American Novel.\\"  Not unlike Demoxie, \\"The Circle\\" stops short of true Greatness in the service of expedience.<br /><br />Right now I feel like an ungrateful guy formerly in the dark complaining to Edison that the light bulb is great, but we really need a better lampshade.  I don't mean to be dismissive or unappreciative.  It's just that a book with so many GREAT ideas, and a premise that is UNIVERSAL for our time, especially in light of our recent headlines on the erosion of privacy and civil rights, just feels like it would have achieved actual, literary greatness (again, \\"Completion\\") had it gone deeper into character motivation, explanation for sudden insights, and more of a fleshing out of situations.  I am saying that it would have felt even more REAL, and therefore the horror/suspense/dread of itall would have been even deeper.<br /><br />Of course, this review is a part of the social media which is the DNA of Egger's novel, and the irony is appreciated by me.  With all these things said, I still defend this as an excellent book.  Its premise is prevalent in our culture, every day, and will only escalate.  In fact, the realization that Egger's extrapolations of what just the slightest twist or tweak to how we use our social media, unfettered surveillance and device culture TODAY are so NOT farfetched that my heartbeat rose to a level that is not common for the act of sitting and reading fiction.  No, something else was going on here,<br /><br />I still cannot help giving \\"The Circle\\" a rating of all five stars.  Its premise and dramatic situations are so strong, and pervasive, that I somehow know that I am changed in some way for having read this book - and that is the highest praise.  Long after I've forgotten the names and specific situations from the novel, I will still have, perhaps in my own DNA, echoes of the horror of what happens when too much is given away too freely for the shallowest of reasons or even the best, highest intentions.  I will never think of the seahorse, the octopus, and the shark in the same way again.

B008602KQI|4.0|I love the questions this film brings to life. We live in a culture of scarcity and to go counter to that milue creates a challenge for the mind.
B008602KQI|4.0|This is a good solid, suspenseful, action, movie. I really enjoyed watching it a second time, and I'm looking forward to the new/next one coming out.
B000DZ6VAK|4.0|The four star  designation = five stars for Tate and the ECO and three for Uchida.  Sound is exceltent .  So to are Jeffrey Tate and and the ECO<br />who sound close to ideal. I find Uchida less convincing, finding her playing pretty but relatively superficial in contrast to such peers as<br />Rudolf and Peter Serkin,  Ingrid Haebler , Walter Klien,  Annie and Edwin Fischer,  Martha Argerich in her # 18, Peter Frankl, Clara Haskil, Monique Haas, Stephen Kovacevich, Emil Gilels, , Alfred Brendel/Marriner in<br />#s 6--15 and with Paul Angerer in #s 22 and 25. I would start by acquiring Haebler's complete set on Philips.  Also, Rudolf Serkin's<br />Sony Mozart concerti  (avoid his too late DG concerti) are due for release in 2017. The Sonys should include #s 9-12, 14, 16, 17, 19-23, 25 and 27,<br />with multiple versions  of a few of these.  The following is a list of no more than five current favorites  of each concerto<br />  #5:  Frager/Boult; Haebler/Galliera; Brendel/Marriner; Frankl/Faerber<br />  #6:  Haebler/Rowicki; Brendel/Marriner<br />  #7:  Brendel/Cooper/Marriner;  Haebler/Hoffmann/Bunge<br />  #8: Brendel/Marriner; Kempff/Leitner; Haebler/Galliera; Tipo/Chailly<br />  #9:  Haskil/Ackermann; Haebler/Rowicki; Frankl/Faerber; Larrocha/Davis; Tipo/Chailly<br />  #10:  Haskil/Anda/Galliera;  Rudolf and Peter Serkin/Sony;  Haebler/Hoffmann/Galliera; Brendel/Cooper<br />  #11: Serkin/Schneider; Haebler/Galliera; Frankl/Faerber; Brendel/Marriner<br />  #12: Monique Haas; Serkin/Schneider; Lupu/Segal; Klien/Vox /Japan; Pollini<br />  #13:  Haskil/DG; Brendel/Marriner; Haebler/Davis; Frager;<br />  #14;  Rudolf and Peter Serkin (each with Schneider); Monique Haas/Leitner; Klien/Angerer; Pires/Abbado; Pollini<br />  #15:  Foldes/Ludwig (You Tube); Peter Serkin/Schneider; Haebler/Davis; Frankl/Faerber<br />  #16:  Rudolf Serkin/Schneider; Peter Serkin/Schneider; Haebler/Davis; Anda/BBC only; Brendel/Marriner<br />  #17  Rudolf and Peter Serkin (each with Schneider); Serkin/Szell; Andor Foldes/Lehmann; Haebler/Rowicki; Frager/Tchkarov<br />  #18  Argerich/Jochum; Haebler/Davis; Brendel/Marriner; Peter Serkin/Schneider<br />  #19  Haskil/Fricsay/DG;  Rudolf and Peter Serkin (Sony and RCA); Larrocha/Segal/Decca; Pollini/Bohm<br />  #20  Haskil/Markevitch; Serkin/Szell; Larrocha/Davis; Edwin Fischer; Haebler/Galliera<br />  #21  Larrocha/Davis; Annie Fischer/Japan;  Klien/Japan; Serkin/Schneider; Monique Haas<br />  #22  Larrocha/Segal;  Brendel/Angerer and Marriner; Frankl/Szell/YouTube; Anda/Silvestri; Edwin Fischer<br />  #23  Frager/Tchkarov; Pollini/Bohm; Curzon/Szell; Annie Fischer/EMI; Moravec/Neumann<br />  #24  Haskil/Markevitch; Kempff/Leitner; Casadesus/Szell; Pollini/DG; Brendel/Marriner; Klien/Japan<br />  #25  Serkin/Szell; Kovacevich/Davis; Larrocha/Davis; Edwin Fischer/Krips; Moravec/Vlach<br />  #26  Larrocha/Davis; Casadesus/Szell; Haebler/Rowicki; Vasary/Vasary; Brendel Marriner (outer movements only)<br />  #27  Haskil/Fricsay; Gilels/Bohm; Anniie Fischer/Kurtz; Klien/Paumgartner; Curzon/Szell; Serkin/Szell; Andor Foldes/Lehmann; Haebler/Rowicki; Frager/Tchkarov<br />  #18  Argerich/Jochum; Haebler/Davis; Brendel/Marriner; Peter Serkin/Schneider<br />  #19  Haskil/Fricsay/DG;  Rudolf and Peter Serkin (Sony and RCA); Larrocha/Segal/Decca; Pollini/Bohm<br />  #20  Haskil/Markevitch; Serkin/Szell; Larrocha/Davis; Edwin Fischer; Haebler/Galliera<br />  #21  Larrocha/Davis; Annie Fischer/Japan;  Klien/Japan; Serkin/Schneider; Monique Haas<br />  #22  Larrocha/Segal;  Brendel/Angerer and Marriner; Frankl/Szell/YouTube; Anda/Silvestri; Edwin Fischer<br />  #23  Frager/Tchkarov; Pollini/Bohm; Curzon/Szell; Annie Fischer/EMI; Moravec/Neumann<br />  #24  Haskil/Markevitch; Kempff/Leitner; Casadesus/Szell; Pollini/DG; Brendel/Marriner; Klien/Japan<br />  #25  Serkin/Szell; Kovacevich/Davis; Larrocha/Davis; Edwin Fischer/Krips; Moravec/Vlach<br />  #26  Larrocha/Davis; Casadesus/Szell; Haebler/Rowicki; Vasary/Vasary; Brendel Marriner (outer movements only)<br />  #27  Haskil/Fricsay; Gilels/Bohm; Anniie Fischer/Kurtz; Klien/Paumgartner; Curzon/Szell
B00D3ITOHG|5.0|Cannot believe that only 1 person has reviewed these.<br /><br />The Charm:<br />I wasn't planning on buying headphones.<br />I saw these in a speciality store, and was charmed by their sleek design.<br />So I tried them on. The fit was amazing. Not too much pressure on the ears.<br /><br />Sound Quality:<br />The sound is really great. I usually use Sennheiser HD550s.. the Marshall have much better and deeper bass.<br />You can customize it too using the inserts that come with the headphones (an innovation in itself).<br /><br />Build Quality:<br />The headphones are extremely well built, sturdy and fold inwards to become super compact.<br />I've been folding them in and out for months now and there is no sign of the band getting weak.<br />Very impressed.<br /><br />Point for Improvement:<br />The only downside is the remote doesn't have volume control.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />- Highly original design<br />- Perfect for traveling / commutes<br />- Great sound and deep bass without being overpowering<br />- Durable & Comfortable / Don't tire your ears out<br />- Perfect for home studio monitoring (i.e. via Apogee one)<br />- Cable quality is top notch (only down side is no volume control..but you can pause/skip to the next song and use SIRI on iPhone)
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I chose three stars because the book started off really good with a good amount of Tobias and Tris romance and finding out all about the factions and what divergent was. The only part i really,  really disliked was the ending. I disliked the ending because it was really sad and not what i expected at all. I wish it would've ended differently because then it would've been a perfect trilogy.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Ok I'm a hunter outside of this game, and sure it's not like you're going to go and skin everything you shoot.  shots are easier than real life, but your access to various weapons is cool. I've also got to kill animal's I've never hunted in places I've never been kool stuff.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|I guess I was surprised because I wasn't expecting much. It is a shame that Karl Urban (a tremendous Scotty on the new Star Trek movies) was limited to scowling and growling. The effects were good, the characters were over the top (good), and the story was engaging. A popcorn movie that doesn't attempt to be any more than that.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|This is one of those books that is hard to put down.  When I am not reading it, I spend my time anticipating when I will get back to it.  Preston & Child never disappoint!
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It's a dictionary -.-<br />Like I like to read a freaking dictionary and it doesn't let me delete it how gay
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This book was awesome!  It doesn't get any better for a true story!  I really can't say enough good things to describe it.  It is a must read!
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|I just started this game and the little Dragon is cute. But pulling back the arrow to shoot will be tedious later.
B005XUC398|5.0|Kevin Spacey is a great actor and I enjoy seeing him in action. Will recommend to anyone who love action movie.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Whether or not you are a Stephen King fan, this book promises to keep you reading longer than you intended, or rather till your eyesight starts to blurr. Being a continuation of the Shining based on Danny, Jack and Wendy's son, all grown up now, it is the best of King's work since The Shining and The Stand. Definitely a must read.
B00F5FBE82|4.0|I love riding to this album, it's pretty laid back. The guest vocalists are different and work well with the songs. I think Drake is an artist, not just a rapper. I absolutely love &#34;Thank Me Later&#34; and I'm so glad Drake didn't disappoint with this album.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is fun, but I don't like the choice of paying for lives or resort to IAP. It's sort of life being held hostage for more game play, which I don't appreciate. Other than that, I'm glad it's finally available on my kindle hd.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I liked the book a lot, even though I tend to shy away from dystopian books.  I persevered and was pleased with the result.  I will be buying the next in the series.
B007THA4FI|2.0|The book is okay, but the foul language is totally unnecessary. If there is a next book in the series, I will pass.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It's a awesome game but it's easy that's why it's awesome<br />I would of recommend it because it's free so get the game
B000UJ48WC|5.0|Kubrick and Nicholson at their finest. The quality is also great besides it being just the best movie. I always put this movie on to fall asleep which probably makes me strange but it relaxes me. I think because it is all acting and very few camera cuts like action movies which tend to stimulate you.<br /><br />Great date movie as well, it scares women so that's a plus as you are there to protect them! Great set too, they built that hotel I believe.
B00F88H5K2|5.0|I was so entirely taken by this film, that I watched it several times, then purchased it.  Oddly by wonderfully, it led me to further investigation and fascination with this tremendous performer.  A truly intelligent individual, Liberace found a niche in the entertainment world, and multiplied that times a thousand.  His folksy Mid-Western interaction with his audiences seems in stark contrast to his lavish, over-the-top lifestyle.  Simply &#34;WONDERFUL&#34;
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Fun app my kids really like it but I think it needs more mini games has lots of updates so they do add stuff frequently
B003VANOFY|2.0|I'm usually a fan of Logitech products.  I own several pieces of their hardware, but this by far has been the most disappointing device I've purchased from them.  I've used these now for about a year.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1) Sounds are good, but not excellent<br />2) Comfortable fit, even after hours of use<br />3) Microphone is good and sounds clear<br />4) Battery life is good<br /><br />Cons)<br /><br />1) FREQUENT disconnects. I've done everything I can think of to alleviate this.  Moving the base away from the computer, reinstalling drivers, making sure no other wireless devices are near, etc etc..  Doesn't matter.<br />2) Build quality is subpar for how much the original price was<br />3) Thing just will not turn on when it's connected for charging.  Holding the power button does nothing.  I have to disconnect the device and then turn it on and reconnect the cable.  If you are really low on juice you have to do this fast and the micro USB connection isn't the easiest to get in there quickly<br />4) DISCONNECTS!!!  In an hour session this will happen to me over 4-5 times.
0156421178|3.0|I'm a huge fan of George Orwell but I'd be the first to admit that some of his books haven't stood the test of time.  \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" is one that hasn't.  It's a straightforward retelling of Orwell's time in Spain during the Spanish Civil War, beginning with his service on the Aragon front and ending with his eyewitness account of the Communist crackdown on Trotskyites in Barcelona.  The narrative is clean, economical, and droll, but it's constructed mostly out of Orwell's first-hand experiences, arranged in chronological order.  We read about the food he ate and the clothes he wore, about what he felt when he was shot in the neck and thought he was going to die, and about his admiration for the humanity and egalitarianism of workers and Anarchists in Barcelona.  His account of a muddled minor infantry attack is superb, as is his evocation of life in the trenches.  But the \\"big picture\\" is rarely drawn, and other persons tend to show up only on the margins of Orwell's own story -- including his wife, who joined him in Spain. She must have been a remarkable woman, but, though she has bit parts in the book, she isn't even named!<br /><br />The book was published soon after Orwell left Spain, while the war was still raging, and I have the impression it was intended mainly to rebut Communist lies about the Spanish Trotskyites.  It works well as a war memoir and anti-Communist polemic, but anyone looking for high literature or deep historical analysis will be disappointed.<br /><br />Memory Lane:  I first read \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" in the 1970s when I went through an Orwell phase in high school.  I didn't like it at all, probably because I expected heavy political insights from the author of \\"1984\\" and \\"Animal Farm.\\"  Now that I'm 54 and better-attuned to the compromises of adult life, I bring different interests to the book.  I am more blown away than ever by Orwell the man, and by the depth of his commitment to the anti-fascist cause:  How many married 30-somethings volunteer to take up arms in a foreign war simply because they believe that one side is in the right?  God knows there are easier ways to get material for a book.  But that said, I stand by my youthful literary assessment.  Orwell's greatness as a man doesn't mean that \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" is a great book.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Paging doctor sleep! Good King book. Just like old times.  With a touch of the shining, it makes you pay more attention to not miss a touch of history (and of course now I want to reread the other book!)  That was why the gunslinger was so genius.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|It's an understatement to say that 1927 was an eventful year.  Bill Bryson's easy-to-read description of the people and events of that time make for a really enjoyable read.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|had promise, but the last 100 or so pages killed it for me. this had to be the WORST ending to a trilogy that I can remember! it felt like all the time I spent reading the previous 2 books and now this were a complete waste...I agree with those that say skip this and come up with your own ending, because this is nothing but a colossal disappointment. I read a few books a week and can't remember the last time I asked for a refund, if ever, but yeah, I want my money back.
B00DXP0QV2|5.0|For the true Nirvana fan, there's a ton of hidden treasures on this fantastic box set! Sounds just as good 20 years later!
006202406X|3.0|I could not wait for this book to be released. Loved the first two books of the trilogy. But, Allegiant was just \\"OK.\\" I was very surprised that Roth chose to change POVs. Thought at first it could be interesting, but soon realized otherwise. I'm not as upset at the way it ended, like others, just that it took so dang long to get there. I felt like it dragged on a bit.
B00G32OER4|5.0|I had more chills in my body than walking outside in below zero weather with wet hair.  You have to pay attention or you will miss important plot points.<br /><br />Excellent movie!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Good idea but pretty worthless until Google accepts apps that devs already wrote but YOU are not allowing. Apple TV is much better right now. Would think Google would open the gates as they are open source friendly.<br /><br />I have used my Chromecast 0 times. Been plugged into my TV sense a week after the release. Bad Google.<br /><br />I'm a cable cutter and I'm using my Simple.TV, Apple TV and a Odroid U2 running Android 4.2.2
B000UJ48WC|5.0|This is one of the classic horror films.  While I am NOT a fan of the horror genre, the acting by Jack Nicholson is outstanding.  This movie manages to be very scary without all of the gore used by so many movies in the genre.
B00FEHXISA|5.0|A lot of movies that have 2nd and 3rd versions are never as good as the first. Not so with Iron Man 3. Just as good as 1 and 2. I liked that they made refrences to the Avengers movie plot as well. Very clever.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft because of how you can build &amp; be creative!!!! :)<br /><br />I just want to say that I love minecraft but I......  that's it I just love minecraft (:
B00FKTDKTO|5.0|I simply love it! Paul McCartney keeps on giving more great music to the people and it just gets better and better.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|quite enjoyed it!<br />Who knew so much could happen in one abbey. Takes a bit to get used to the British accent, but love hearing it.
0802130208|2.0|This is something I'd expect a 22-year-old MFA student to submit for critique in class, and then get lambasted by his teacher and fellow students. Instead it won a Pulitzer. I could only make it to page 50, shaking my head in disbelief the last 20. I gave this two stars instead of one because there were a few good sentences in the opening couple of pages. For funny, dark humor that's well written, read George Saunders.<br /><br />If you find the following insufferable dialogue engaging in any way, go ahead and read the book:<br /><br />  \\"Ignatius was such a precious child. I don't know what made him change. He used to say to me, 'Momma, I love you.' He don't say that no more.\\"<br />  \\"Aw, don't cry, Patrolman Mancuso said, deeply moved. \\"I'll make you some more coffee.\\"<br />  \\"He don't care if they lock me up,\\" Mrs. Reilly sniffled. She opened the oven and took out a bottle of muscatel. \\"You want some nice wine, Mr. Mancuso?\\"<br />  \\"No thanks. Being on the force, I gotta make a impression. I gotta always be on the lookout for people, too.\\"<br />  \\"You don't mind?\\" Mrs. Reilly asked rhetorically and took a long drink from the bottle. Patrolman Mancuso began boiling the milk, hovering over the stove in a very domestic way. \\"Sometimes I sure get the blues. Life's hard. I worked hard, too. I been good.\\"<br />  \\"You oughta look on the bright side,\\" Patrolman Mancuso said.
B005T87QCI|5.0|The game is really  good although I wish you can unlock  some robots I wish they made a campaign mode were you play like in movies

B00BD99JMW|1.0|Do not waste your time or money on this book...  I really did not like it at all which is too bad because I loved Divergent.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I wanted a search engine on my iphone. I have been using Google for years on my PC. There is none other like it. So, I installed it on my iphone. A smart move on my part

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Youngest son loves game...a must buy..even I enjoyed the game, I'm not big on games but this one is fun..
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you for adding one of my favorite games.  Now I can play on the go without my laptop.  Awesome sums it up. Now just work on Pet Saga..... Thanks again
B005IQZB14|4.0|There comes the time when a person must face up to both the things in life that we can control and the things we can't.  Ms. Strayed has a complex childhood, a mother who dies young and a bio father who cannot face up to the opportunities and joys of raising children to unravel.  Undertaking an epic journey is the catalyst that reveals and shapes her view of life.  It's a good book.
B00DUCXFUC|5.0|Everything came in as promised, fast shipping and the product is just great. Very happy I made this purchase. I highly recommend it.
B005H9B44A|5.0|One of the greatest productions of all time. Thrilling, fast and make you hold your breath. I am waiting for a new release!
B00BKZUVGM|4.0|AMAZING I loved but the end I... I... just can't explain<br />It was excellent the shared pic from both trips and Tobias and you find out what is happening in the outside world
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As the last of a series I have to say the story played out well the ending was nice and is very easy to recomend to all.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|This pathetic game thrives off of micro transactions. They only allow you to play a limited time before cutting off.
048623231X|5.0|What a beautiful collection of Dore's work page after page, it's nothing more then gorging yourself on his illustrations, what a delight.<br /><br />As of late I have been creating some art work using Dore's style of art. I was tired of flipping through &#34;Dante's Inferno&#34; to find each illustration as a reference. I came across this book and was more then pleased to received it and have all the reference material of Dore's illustrations I could have ever hoped for all in one place.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|The song that slayed the universe. Its just a great dance/electronic/pop song. Its fresh and new with a killer beat and I just love it. Not to mention its a song dedicated to her fans! And how shed die without them
B00AB7HESI|1.0|Whenever I start the game I get a popup saying that I don't own it! Then when I click details it beings be to the amazon appstore page with the &quot;open&quot; button at the top. What is going on?
B007T8BYWE|5.0|I wish more of the options were free. But I will probably pay for a couple of them.<br /> I love these games. All of them. They are so entertaining.
B00G32QIEG|4.0|It wasnt the best but not the worst. the action was good.  you can tell what was happening.<br />the stars where good, too
B000YJ85BI|5.0|I've read the first 3 books in this series in remarkable time, considering I'd actually had a pretty long hiatus from fiction before reading them. They made me remember how much fun a book can be. Scalzi really comes up with some intricate plots. Look forward to reading more.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|it has a great story line, and you wouldnt find out what happens in the end teil the end, the other actors where great, too.  it was longer than what it would have been.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Not a 5 because trying to sell you item to play. But fun to play and very addictive. Colorful and always different
B0011UBDTK|4.0|BEWARE, the first and second edition box sets are not exactly the same. Both box sets contain the six seasons 94 episodes, but this first box set produced in 2008 does not contain the two bonus movies that are included in the 2010 box set (also available on Amazon), and the extra bonus disc is not the same either. It is up to you to decide which version you prefer.
B0041D843M|4.0|Awesome information with irrefutable evidence and believable conspiracies. But just a bit wordy. But still a guideline for health and longevity
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Another great perfomance of  Tom Cruise and the other actors, with beautiful architects designs and very creative machines .<br />a lot of fun and imagination¡
0399159347|5.0|love the plot and the wholw story just flowed. I recommended this book to five people who also purchased it.  I will look forward to more reads from  this author.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|Love the fun and funny antics of Mo and all the different characters in the game!  Great graphics, easy to play for a variety of ages and keeps you wanting to get to the promises land.  I don't play games much so when I find time this game is the one I go to.
1476727651|5.0|As always, Stephen King delivers on a great book.  It was nice to see a continuance of The Shining and what happened to that poor little boy and his mother.  I wouldn't dare miss a  new Stephen King novel.  You never know what might happen if I did!<br /><br />JellyB24
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app gives you a lot of weather information. I coach different outdoor teams and it helps keep me up to date on what is going on outside.
006202406X|2.0|This book was so disappointing. I loved divergent and I liked insurgent. This book did not hold my attention at all. I thought  80% of the book felt like filler. I just kept reading it like blah blah blah when is something interesting going to happen. When it finally did I hated the outcome. 2 stars for the effort but I would not recommend this book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A game that works the mind. It is addicting to play, and a challenge.  Nice to way to end a hard day of work.
B0052GACNM|5.0|I have liked his work over the years ever since hearing and dancing to &#34;I Left My Heart in San Francisco&#34;. This and his other duet albums show he is the consummate pro and hasn't lost any of his smoothness. When paired with an amazing group of singers and top notch arrangements and band it just can't get better-until the next duets album he does.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I real like all the options that you have with the robots to personalize them to you own liking. But for some reason, it won't connect to my facebook
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this ap.  I use it nearly every day at work to make sure I return from breaks on time.  Ever since the last update I no longer get a push notification when the alarm sounds.  If the volume is turned down I dont know the timer has expired unless I have the ap displayed on screen.
0307592731|5.0|This was a quick read for me but I know some who had trouble getting through the beginning,  It held my interest and the author, my admiration.  I would recommend it.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|Love Justin Timberlake as an actor! This is a vey cute movie and Mila is so pretty. Great chemistry between the both of them. Seller gave me a good dvd. Sold as promised!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|this app is great if you need something to wake you up in the morning its useful when it tells you how much time you have before the alarm rings
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Lots of fun for all ages. Good to kill time too. Takes some time on some challenges. Still a good time.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Great game but too many phenomenon . Rooms always blocked, still play just uses more energy. Still lots of fun!!!
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|It's obvious that people who didn't like this movie don't grasp that it's a \\"coming of age\\" story for Superman. He's not the Superman we \\"know\\" in this movie because he hasn't gotten to that point yet. He's still trying to figure everything out. I mean... the first time he puts on his suit is so he can turn himself over to Zod. ALL of this is brand new to him, including fighting a group of beings that are just as powerful as him yet more skilled as warriors. So you can imagine that destruction is just going to happen around them. The only thing I didn't love about this movie is the climactic fight between Kal-El and Zod was hard to follow because of the frenetic camera work. Other than that... I love this movie and can't wait to own it on blu-ray!
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Loved the movie didn't think I'd enjoy it at first but my mind is forever changed great action and can't wait for the next one to come out
B004L0NGEC|5.0|Long time Picasso user, and this App automatically brings all photos from uploaded Picasso website and separate android phone photos to my Fire.  Love seeing the shots on the big, bright Fire screen.  ONLY negative is the Fire will not accept the videos I shoot! Amazon needs to allow FLASH DRIVE.
B005J4TLN4|5.0|Because it wasn't a really well known movie in America that was British. I thought it would be impossible to find so when I saw it had to get it, it arrived a little earlier than planned which was great, and without any damages
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I'm squeamish, so this movie is good for me when I want zombie action. Just the right amount of action and the time necessary to calm down before the next &#34;look away!&#34; Scene.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Easy to learn and fun right away. Enough variety to keep things interesting. In ap purchases for the impatient. Try it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I've been hearing about this show for a while now and never had the time to watch it. When I realized that being a member of amazon prime and that I could watch for free it was perfect. Love the story and now can't wait for season 4.
B004ZRV3AU|1.0|When it came it was missing a wing nut so I couldn't even put it together. I was really disappointed because I had really high hopes for this product and the project I was going to do.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I don't know where to start!!! well thisbgame is awesome I don't care if everybody says I play it to much I still like it......<br /><br />oh yea and it better than CUPCAKES
B000I9YXKG|5.0|First saw in 1967 with college boyfriend, and we laughed about the idea that &#34;married people never talk.&#34;  Saw it 45 years later, still laugh at the idea.  Clever writing and great performances by both Hepburn and Finney.  Sophisticated 60's film that could have been written today.<br /><br />Loved it!
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|I love the dry sense of humor from Francis Underwood and how he talks to the viewer like they are his best friend and insider (probably the only person he is truly honest with).  There are so many layers going on that I can watch it endlessly.  Another reviewer called him Mr. Machiavelli - how apt!  The other players are fascinating, as well.  While I don't see any soft spots with Francis, his wife has a few.  Peter Russo has so much potential but greater still are his weaknesses.  I would like to see a prequel.  What was Francis' youth like?  How did he meet Claire?  Was she like she is now or did he mold her into the woman she is today?
B005KELW26|5.0|fits right and secure for my kindle fire!  love it!  color is true to picture. you can fold the latch back to keep it out of the way with the magnet
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Great show. I like funny movies and I like action movies and if I can get both in one flick, kudos!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This movie is FABULOUS! Love this movie so much <33333 Absolutely perfect!I love Anne Hathaway! And Sarah!! :) It shipped in a good amount of time and was well worth the price!
B0035LJY6C|4.0|I remember seeing The Addams Family in the theater back in '91.  I just watched it with my teenagers and they got a kick out of it, then said I was very old.  Ha!
B0063IH60K|3.0|Best solitare game of those tried, love it, but ads are nuts. Worse yet, after 5000+ games it stopped loading and doesn't respond for days. Have had to reload 4 times, good it's free but lost stats. Still not always running.
B00BAXFAJC|1.0|It is not the first time that I have been disappointed by an award winning book. Who are these people who made such an awful selection for the Booker this year? This is terrible and slow.  I feel like I wasted my money.  Can Kindle give me my money back?
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|If you love figuring out enchanted puzzles this game is great, it's hard enough to make me have to actually think about some parts but not so hard that I want to send my kindle flying across the room :)
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Disliked season finale immensely...why are they killing off so much of the cast?  It was good until the last episode.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Puzzles can be fun other times frustrating. The Room is both. Challenging enough to keep you hooked, and hard enough to keep you occupied for some time. I'll admit I turned to the hints when I did grasp the subtle clues.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game has great real looking animals love to hunt from home. Best hunting game i have seen yet. You will be hooked instantly.
B00D6JX3OM|5.0|Love the mixture of folk and local sounds.  Definitely takes off where Soul Cages left us last. His mUsic is so colorful with imagery.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|I really wanted to give this book only 2 stars but it did keep me distracted while recuperating from a cold and I didn't want to completely discourage someone else from a little entertainment. It was just entertaining enough to keep me coming back for more but the ending was soooo predictable it was a huge disappointment .. no twists here. In the end everyone is appropriately civil and does the right thing so the reader goes away feeling pretty good about being part of the human family.
B001XUPD94|5.0|This was a great movie. We love the original Star Trek movies. I would definitely recommend this movie. 5 stars!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved this book!  I have read a lot of Steven King's books and loved them all.  There is something about this one that makes it my favorite of any book!  The story moved well; it didn't jump around.  I loved all the characters!  It was were  a supernatural book by genre, but really just &#34;different&#34;.  You will not be disappointed if you read this book!!!!!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|the vid i watched was just a look at video but can't wait, season 4 should be good with twists and turn, dram, everything that makes the show good.
B00FQAZ7PW|5.0|This should have been the album after yield.  It has the same energy.  The musicianship of this band is un matched.
B00153ZC8Q|5.0|Come on, do I really have to explain why this is a sci-fi classic? He'll be back, that's all you need to know.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini weaves a tale through generations and landscapes capturing the emotions of young and old. A book I highly recommend and will read again!
031623480X|5.0|I love this book.  I  think the truths about gluten and carbs that are revealed in this book will change the lives of many people for the better.  I plan on giving this book to all my family and friends as a Christmas gift.<br />Before reading this book I had already lost weight on a low carb diet, I had no idea that carbs/gluten had such a impact on my brain and my overall health.  I intend to follow the guidelines in this book for myself and my family.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I like playing, very interesting, good plots and variety keeps my interest and me coming gback cormore. traditional item search
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This really helps thank you so much because I can use it to help me for homework done and get good grades
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|My six year old little boy laughed his head off the whole time he watched this movie! He thought it was great!
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|What can you say? Very gloomy story about a bunch of dumb and very unlucky guys in Alaska being killed off one by one by a pack of giant CGI wolves. A lot less interesting than it sounds, basically 'Jaws in the Snow', LOL.<br /><br />It could've been good if the plane crash survivors had come up with some smart, successful ways to fend off the pack and maybe find a way for at least some of them to escape their predicament/get rescued. But no, the battle is almost completely one-sided, and absolutely everybody dies, including Neeson.<br /><br />Might be halfway cool if you're fascinated with downer films and death, as this is kind of a 'nature gets even with man' snuff film. But boring, preposterous, pretentious, and downright silly to everyone else. Also misrepresents wolves and actual wolf behavior in a pretty major way.<br /><br />Doesn't work as a survival film, doesn't work as a monster movie. Pass.
B009AMANBA|2.0|Not a fan of this movie. I thought it dull and boring. Gave it to my 86-year old mother afterward and she enjoyed the video for its historical value -- so, not a total dud!
0807014273|5.0|Frankl's amazing account of his survival in German camps, along with his application of logo therapy, make this a powerful testimony to the horror of the camps and man's ability to deal with many horrors in life.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|like so many others, I was sooo excited for this book after the ending of Insurgent. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did.  all of a sudden I'm at the end and I can't believe it. I would still read the book, but I was definitely disappointed.
B000KITQK2|5.0|Packaged well and performs well. Gives the acoustic electric an added boost before going into the amp or mixer. Controls add enough control that it isn't harsh sounding.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Another embodiment of why I've read all of his books to date. Can't wait to read Inferno.  A page turner as always
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I just love Sh Walt Longmire.  He has a witty sense of humor and I love his respect for the Natve American culture.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|this is the best jewels game I have ever played. the graphics and sound were great too. I love how it has many levels and keeps track of where you left off.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|thought it was candy crush on kindle. then realized it said help guide...can't believe they don't have candy crush app available on kindle fire hd
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Had a great time playing this,  wish there were more levels though. Challenging enough but it never gets boring. loved it!!!
006202406X|1.0|The ending was terrible, but upon reflection, the rest of the book was just as bad. I was so looking forward to reading this book because I loved the first two. All the reasons that I loved tris and four in divergent just wee not there, they seemed like different people. More annoying, insecure, weak people.  Mostly I'm so mad that I recommended this series to so many people.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved this book! I often wonder upon finishing a book what happened next? This was true of The Shining as well. I loved the way Mr. King brought Danny Torrance through adulthood and finished the story. This book kept my attention from start to finish.
B00271HAK8|5.0|I probably can't say anything that hasn't already been said about this movie. It is a movie that still makes me laugh even though I have seen it many times. One thing I can say now that I am older is that;  all kidding aside,  I can truly appreciate the  message about life moving fast. Bottom line is that is a gem, and I am glad I have been able to enjoy so many times (probably more than &#34;nine times&#34; :-)).
B008EKON56|5.0|I bought this nifty little device really not knowing how it would perform (especially considering its low price) -- was I pleasantly surprised!  I use an iPod Classic as an auxiliary music server to my main stereo system, the FiiO L11 allows you to by-pass the iPod's internal headphone circuit and go directly from the 30-pin connection as a 'line out' from the iPod's hard drive/DAC chip.  In addition, the FiiO offers the flexibility to use any 'mini to RCA' (or 'mini to mini') cable, so experiment away!  There are no other devices like this on the market today that I know of (except the use of a dock) and I would enthusiastically recommend the L11 to anyone wishing to expand the flexibility of any iPod using a 30-pin connection.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I love the game but hate the timer. very frustrating. I'm not going to spend money every time I run out of lives. 5 stars for the game 0 stars with timer.
B00FX8FQ76|5.0|Love this music! She is so talented. Like almost every track. Nice variety. Pretty sure she will have many more hits off this album.
B00AKYRCNY|5.0|My grandson is two and does an amazing job with this app. It is really fun for him because as he drags each vehicle from the left onto the main screen, the vehicle makes it's noise - honking or siren blowing, etc.
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Special effects and acting were good, story-line a little thin, but who cares when you get to see automatons and monsters smash it out in locales around the world? Fun flick
0757302661|4.0|Good for an explanation, but for me, still needed birthing class.  And ended up getting the book with the class.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Lucked out and got a free trial.  Beautiful graphics, creepy background noise.  The puzzles can be solved without the hints, but if you're impatient to see what's at the end, hint away.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this one also.  Let's me fill many boring hours at my husband's medical treatments and takes my mind off my problems.  Love it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is highly addictive. I recommend it to those who don't got nothing to do. So play on everybody play on.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Please stop with the changes. Whoever is making them is beyond clueless. A vendor my company does work with is completely revamping their product with one of their main thoughts being is less mouse movement, in other words, arranging stuff on a particular page in a way that makes sense. Yahoo's placement of things on the page makes no sense. And for heaven's sake, BRING BACK TABS.<br /><br />And amazon, you requiring a WRITTEN review with a certain number of words required in the review is pretty damn bogus, too. I think more people would review products if they could just click on a star instead of having to write a review.<br /><br />Note: this is one of the few things I've reviewed on amazon  because I hate it to much.
B0060ANOXY|5.0|My girlfriend's daughter listened mostly to early punk growing up. Iggy Pop, etcetera. She wasn't in to Pink Floyd or any music like it, nor a part of the Roger v. Gilmour arguments. She happened to be over when I had this on, and she loved it. She came over again and I had this on, and she again said she loved it. She later saw Roger doing a few of these songs live on his \\"In The Flesh\\" DVD, which I played for her. She again commented about these songs favorably. This, from a person that has never liked Pink Floyd, nor was aware of any Floyd history. I would expect no less.<br /><br />Amused to Death is probably the finest Pink Floyd album ever produced. It is that, largely, because it was Roger Waters unencumbered by the other 3 houseplants that comprised Pink Floyd. He didn't have to play politics in order to record his music. He didn't have to babysit Dave's ego. He created a great concept, turned it into a storyline of songs which flowed into each other, leading the listener down a path to the logical conclusion.<br /><br />The album wasn't dependent on a \\"comfortably Numb\\" solo, nor on bandmates who contributed little, took much, and whined that there wasn't more. The album, like the other 5 successful Pink Floyd albums before it, succeeded because of the solid concepts, and quality craftsmanship of the songs by Waters. In fact, Waters could have taken his work from the other 5 Pink Floyd albums (DSOTM - FINAL CUT), which comprised the vast majority of the songs from those albums, and could have produced them without the 3 houseplants, to great success. As much success as he had with Floyd? Perhaps not... but with enough success to matter. Success in art is not generally dependent on sales, or chart positions, or fanboys. Success in art is measured by longevity and/or relevance. For example, when is the last time you heard ANY cut off the self-titled David Gilmour album from the late 70s, on any radio station? NEVER. My point exactly. That album is as irrelevant today as it was the day it was released.<br /><br />Amused To Death is as relevant today, post-9/11, than it was when first released; an amazing reality. This album was a premonition to a primer on W.'s government, Iraq, and the rise of the fascist Right in America. It is also a glimpse of the more distant future, should we (America and other western powers) stay on the same road. The last time I heard a cut on the radio from Amused to Death? A few weeks ago.<br /><br />One of the many highlights of this album is Don Henley's duet with Roger on Watching TV. It is hard to determine which is better: the harmony of the two, or the message in the song. Both are incredibly intense, making this one of my favorite songs on the album.<br /><br />\\"Perfect Sense\\"... summing up the insanities of life and death, religion and nuclear submarines, in perfect sense terms as \\"dollars and cents\\". Just amazing and too correct.<br /><br />\\"The Bravery Of Being Out Of Range\\", discussing the obvious. Folks get brave when they have no skin in the game. Watch a few Fox News reruns from the buildup to Iraq to see the reality of this.<br /><br />I could go on, but this album deserves your ear, and your ear deserves this album.<br /><br />Amused to Death is a valid political statement, just as Animals was a political statement. In fact, both albums discuss very comparable things. The Wall and The Final Cut were also political statements, discussing similar things. These albums, written primarily by Waters, are also roundly rejected by most Gilmour fanboy types, leaving the logical conclusions to be:<br />1) they reject politics in music<br />2) they reject Waters' politics in music<br />3) they reject anything that requires more thought than the \\"Numb\\" solo<br />4) all of the above<br /><br />Look. Waters worldview is not for everyone. It doesn't go over big in Texas, unless played live in a stadium, where the politics can be excused as \\"art\\". But, Waters' worldview is his... and he expresses it in his art. Millions of HUMAN BEINGS agree with his politics, and find him to be a heroic figure. I am one of them. Millions of others appreciate his art as art, and not as political statements. I can do that too. There are a relatively small minority of individuals who reject his politics, and therefore, reject his art. Those people likely wouldn't know art if it bit them in the nether regions, and their minds are too small to absorb many messages anyway, except possibly from infomercials, Xtian hucksters, and the like. Those people, one must first try to educate and, when that fails, you simply move on. The dregs of the world will never get it, for one reason or another.<br /><br />People.... don't miss this album. No, it doesn't contain Top 40 hits; that wasn't \\"the point\\". The point, I believe, was to illustrate, through music, just where humanity has gone wrong, where the current trajectory will take us, and perhaps give the message of hope that, as intelligent beings, we have a choice and more importantly, we have a responsibility to make a WISE choice. Waters succeeds in that message. Listen to the disgruntled Gilmour fanboys... miss a gem.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Addictive! I do wish you got more lives or didn't have to wait so long to warn your lives back.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|The game is very nicely done. The problem is some items are to well hidden. When the time runs out with one item left its very frustrating. But you do get addicted very quickly.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was at first disappointed that I couldn't get this app but am not overly happy about it being available! It's addicting! It's a lot of fun. I recommend everyone give it a try
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This book is fantastic! I am a 17 year old girl, and there is nothing wrong with letting younger people read this book. Please continue to read more than the beginning, because when you start, you can't put it down! This book stole a lot of my night sleep.<br />And don't be afraid of reading it even if you are not English! I am Norwegian :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|absolutely love this game. highly addictive.  not happy until I have all three stars on each love. easy to get caught up in and lose track of time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I did not think I would like this game. But I really do enjoy it, I actually don't want to put it up once I start playing it. I'm hook on another game.
B0093QE37S|5.0|Great cast and stars. It's cute, funny and crazy. Anyone who is looking for a classic lighthearted movie should watch this.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Divergent and Insurgent were a big success they were great! The conclusion to the trilogy was a big fat fail. I do not recommend it to anyone unless you enjoy feeling broken and sad. Veronica Roth  had so much potential until she turned into a sick Suzanne Collins wannabe.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Severely Damaged
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I admit it......I like this game too much.  So glad it is now available on the Kindle.  So easy to see and gives my laptop a break.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|So far so good. This app has been the best alarm clock ever and I just got it. It doesn't startle  you when it goes off.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I just love candy crush.... I play it all the time :). Everyone should play it.... Just love Candy Crush!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This app is amazing. I use it everyday on my free time. I love the update and new changes they do to the app. Yes it has some glitch, like most app's have, but the tablet edition has less glitches. The best thing about this app is that is free!! Nothing can bet that and its a lot of fun for everyone.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I would highly recommend it, It is full of action and twists and turns. It is one of my favorite shows.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|love the 3 tips! very smooth glide across my kindle screen! i would buy this again! and the price..... phenomenal!!
B00FX8CLSI|5.0|Anything, knot wise, by J.D. Lenzen is good. A lot of detailed picture and good text. I have all three of his knot books, the Kindle version, and use them all on my iPad. Very easy to follow. If you enjoy paracording then you will enjoy this book.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|When I first got it I suck now I have every thing.you have to get a lot of but it is easy just buy a lot of Jules and then you will be done.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|Anything, knot wise, by J.D. Lenzen is good. A lot of detailed picture and good text. I have all three of his knot books, the Kindle version, and use them all on my iPad. Very easy to follow. If you enjoy paracording then you will enjoy this book.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I won't dwell on what the Chromecast does, because if you're reading these reviews you are probably already aware of its features.  I have found it to be almost flawless in streaming from either a browser on my computer or a Netflix, YouTube or Google Music session initiated from my phone or tablet.  Once in awhile my phone will lose track of what is playing and I'll have a hard time controlling it, but I think that my phone is primarily to blame in those cases.<br /><br />The only shortcomings I have found are things that I wish it could do.  One is being able to stream anything displayed on your Android device.  This was initially available via some third party apps, but Google locked it down, so now you are restricted to the applications that are Chromecast enabled.  As far as the hardware goes, it would be nice if it had an ethernet port, so that I didn't have to rely on a wireless connection.  Perhaps this will be something included in the next version.<br /><br />All in all, I would highly recommend this product and for the price, it can't be beat.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Great season!!!  My favorite so far!  Intense and suspenseful, leaves you wanting more!  Great show and cast!  I can't wait to see the next episode!
B0015DWJ8W|4.0|I'm not a runner, far from it, but my elderly father is. Dad took up running when he was in his 50s and, until he was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2004, he ran 19 marathons.<br /><br />Anyway, I thought it'd be interesting to read this book by a Japanese novelist who is also a marathoner and a triathlete. I was hoping he could give some good insights into why people run.<br /><br />This short memoir had some interesting moments about how marathoners/triathletes train and what they think about when they run. I love reading insights into how authors operate but felt that there was too much on how he writes and not enough on how he runs. For a running book, it could've spent more time talking about running.<br /><br />It's a good book, certainly, but it could've been better. I liked the author's writing style, though, and at some point, may give one of his novels a try.
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|Great Album. If you like music you need to add this to your collection. The tracks are solid all the way thru.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Very good entertainment that keeps you sit in front of the screen watching most of the human features.<br />No matter the era, the driving forces are still the same.
1476727651|5.0|Stephen King has been a part of my life as long as I can remember.  Growing up, books saved my life, including every single one of Mr. King's except for one or two.  They also changed my life and gave me some crazy phobias.  Clowns, sewer drains, topiary, just to name a few.  Now the man has added RV's and top hats.  Nice.  But I digress.<br /><br />I loved this book.  What King did with the flawless story of the Torrances was improved with this perfect rendering of a grown-up Danny Torrance.  I did not miss the topiaries.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|I enjoy games for my Kindle Fire that help my wind down as I prepare for sleep. This game does that nicely. it also stimulates a bit of strategy, which is also appealing. I'm tempted to show it to my brother, but worry my Kindle may become his.
B004R2DS9C|4.0|It keeps all the Star Wars Lego mess in one organized box and also functions as a reenactment space. It zips up on the sides.  It's fairly sturdy too. I really like it and so does my 5 year old.
B004Y1WCDE|4.0|I like Netflix b/c of the versatility of where you can watch TV (When I do watch it), but Netflix is slow on the shows and movies I like. Now I can buy the DVD, put it on my computer, and get the same experience. I can watch it on my TV, tablet, or phone. All are synched.  I'm rating the suite of software needed to fully appreciate the PlexApp (PlexMedia) experience. You can also listen to your iPhone music, videos, and anything you find on the Internet. Using it with the iPhone and LG TV was ridiculously easy. Once you got things started that is.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Documentation: The documentation needed to get everything started is all there, but NOT in a very organized manner. they BELIEVE it is well documented, but it took a long time to understand the different programs, servers, apps, and websites needed to get things moving. But it was well worth it! They should try a step-by-step approach for each of the things you need to get the thing working. Most of it was easy to use, but it was like a easy-medium puzzle to piece everything together. As a user, I shouldn't have to do that.<br /><br />Kindle Fire: No support for Kindle Fire - I may actually dump the Kindle for an Android tablet because I like to watch TV in bed before I fall asleep.<br /><br />LG TV Support:  Playing movies works well, but I can't fast forward or rewind during playback.<br /><br />Server: It took a while to get the server going. Not the server for playing within the home network, but the one needed to play movies outside the home. If you don't want to watch/listen to your stuff away from home, then it's not an issue. My wireless router could not be automatically configured. I was surprised I could get it going. It's set up but I haven't tried using it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally we get to have candy crush on our kindles! This was long over due. Love this game and thank you for finally providing your customers with it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love the app on kindle fire. finally! I love playing this on my Kindle fire! my whole family plays this game
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|The very edge of your seat action none stop. It was a all new type of Godzilla and King Kong all in one movie I really loved this sify action thiller about big mongsters from beyond the ocan rim. Thanh you so very much. There just has to be a #2 remake?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is a must read for any romance lover.  The depth of emotion conveyed by James is awesome. Can't wait to read the next one.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|AMAZING JUST AMAZING!!! I loved every second of it!! Thank you Veronica Roth for making my favorite series ever!!  It was thrilling and exciting! There was a lot of moments where I didn't want to read it because it made me cry my eyes out but that's how u know it's a good story if makes you have emotions! This series makes me thankful for my life that I have and I'm glad my life isn't like Tris's. I'm sad that this series is now over but at least I can always go back and read it again. Again I want to thank Veronica Roth YOU DID AMAZING!!!!!
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|But this show is so well written, it's compelling, I love it! The characters and relationships are fleshed out and real. It' snot just about zombies. It really explores the way people who are normally &#34;good&#34; or &#34;bad&#34; can change in stressful situations (of all kinds).
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|This is such an inspiring story..One person, even a child CAN make a difference!<br />So proud of this beautiful young woman..
B00BB22GQM|5.0|Vampire Weekend is perfect, therefore this album is perfect, therefore buy it. Every song is meaningful and beautiful. buy it please, and the other two albums.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Diamond dash is so much fun the power ups and bonuses give me a rush this game is truly addictive
B008OW1S3O|5.0|I bought this album and in less than a month I fell completely in love with it. Their music can't be classified, but trust me it's amazing. It's literally a perfect album so worth owning.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|So far it is doing what it says. I like the dim feature and also the app doesn't have to be running to use.
B009V0TV6O|5.0|This is a pretty neat app - it lets you hear and visualize all kinds of rhythms. Some people have complained that it's the free version, but there's a simple workaround for that: press the menu button and choose exit, then start the app again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy Amazon finally got with it and made this game available. Addictive but FUN! Love the fact you can get different power ups.
B003YV64OI|5.0|First off I'd like to state that mine unlocked to a Phenom II X4 B50 without L3 and is such a Propus chip, so for all intents and purposed you can consider this an Athlon II X4. I paired this with an HD7850 for a mid range gaming build and performs excellently, playing every game I throw at it. In day to day usage it is very snappy and with 8GB of RAM I have only frozen of slowed this CPU down about 4 times in 10 months I've been using it, which is something I haven't been able to say for my Parents Pentium E5300 and my old Athlon II X2 270 which was clocked a tad higher at 3.4GHz. If you find the various Athlon II X3s (445,450,455) you choose the cheapest one as you con raise the clock speed quite easily, and since the voltages are the same temps should not increase. This is why I chose the 450 over the 455 as it was around 8-10 dollars cheaper. All in all, a great CPU for the money.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is a fun colorful game with tons of dragons coming. You should totally hit it is so much fun, and the best part is it is free!!!
0802407692|5.0|I am loving reading this book.  Knowing my husbands love language really does help me be a better wife and friend!
B00F08ADX6|5.0|We love the &quot;bunny choir&quot; at the end of each round--it's so fun! Buddy does so many funny things. It's so easy and fun for (maybe) everyone. (Quoted from my 7-year-old. This is the first time she has ever asked to review a game!)
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham has done it again! A legal setting -- his forte -- and a return to The setting of A Time to Kill, I hated to put the book down until completed. A must read for John Grisham fans.
0061124958|5.0|This was one of my favorite stories growing up, I read it to my 4/5th graders when I taught, and now it's my grand-daughter's (age 9) turn to enjoy the story of Charlotte and Wilber.
B00008G1J0|5.0|At the time I wrote this there were 35 reviews???  This is one of the best examples of some of that sweet, sweet 90's greatness that many did not hear or maybe just didn't appreciate at the time.  If you are at all a fan of bands like Soul Asylum, Pixies, Pavement, Lemonheads, Cracker, Jane's Addiction/Porno for Pyros, Primus, or hell even early Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains you should like this album.  Just straight rocks from start to finish.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I have to say I didn't like how the book went back and forth between Tris and Tobias point of view. This was different then the last two books. I didn't like the choices made with the main characters but I understood why the author wrote it this way. Life isn't always the way you want it. I get that. Love doesn't always win the end. But I love the rawness of the story and love Christina's action to stop Four when it was needed. I tried not to write a spoiler alert for my friends who are still reading. I'm sad with the outcome but loved the journey.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Keeps story line on track and characters in role.  Good plot development throughout each show with storyline hooks that keep you engaged for the next show.  Great cast and direction.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I thought the author did a great job of wrapping up the trilogy. The story line followed the previous two books and if you read &#34;Insurgent&#34; you pretty much know what this story is going to be about.<br /><br />My only complaint would be that the author switches between Tris and Tobias points of view every other chapter and I find that it can detract from the story and it is hard to &#34;zone&#34; back in to the story when you are constantly having to refocus.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|I own over 1,000 albums in my vast music collection, but this one is one of those few rares that I come back to every now and then, no matter how many albums more I will get in the future. Why, you're asking? Well, simply because it's a brilliant album, every song has its own mood, and Darren Hayes's voice is magical, no less. He can express softness, happiness and the most personal thoughts he has through the music. Daniel Jones, of course, has its share in Savage Garden music as he writes and composes most material, and still - it's the lovely voice of Darren that shines throughout the album. I am never tired of this cd, really. It one of the albums you can sit and listen to as a whole from start to finish, and still have your favorites between the songs. Mine are Affirmation - a fast and infectious song that smells a little bit like a mix between the 80s and the 90s, which is a good thing; Hold Me - one of the most sincere and moving mid-tempo ballads on this album; The single I Know I Loved You (wish someone could tell me such a romantic sentence!); Crash And Burn - one of the songs I always feel cheerful after hearing; Two Beds And A Coffee Machine - a moving and sad story about a beaten woman; I Don't Know You Anymore, one of the most heartfelt loneliness songs I've ever heard in my life until now.<br />This CD is quite old now, being released in 1999, but sounds fresh and relevant for today as it was for back then. I'm just sorry Savage Garden are not making music anymore, as it was the team of Daniel Jones & Darren Hayes that made some of the best pop music in the late nineties. If you loved &#34;Affirmation&#34; you should get the dou's first album as well. It's every bit as good.<br />Buy this, if you're a true music lover - believe me, you'll never regret this!
156224003X|5.0|Its already making a difference in my playing and more importantly my attitude toward performance. Should be part of every teacher's curriculum.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a awesome app. Don't think just buy. If you are a type that likes going on adventures, this is a perfect rainy day app. What should I do on a rainy day?  PLAY MINECRAFT!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Veronica Roth has killed of the main character. Not even J.K. Rowling was that cold. This book was great until the last 100 pages. Then everything bad started to happen. If you read the first two books than you should leave it at that. The epilouge was a joke, seriously Tobias becomes a asistant to a politician. I thought Veronica could do better. I guess I will have one less movie to watch.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I give this book four stars because it kept me up in the early hours (this is a good and bad thing, but overall a great thing)<br /><br />This book immerses readers to think and feel what Ender endure through the games. Readers will find themselves trying to predict Ender's and supporting characters' actions.<br /><br />Finishing &#34;Ender's Game&#34;, I am stoked about watching the film.
B004LUS390|4.0|Agreed with most of the reviewers and their comments that this app does deliver infinite possibilities to bring out one's creativity on a mobile device. But a user like me who can barely draw a line straight on paper had tough time drawing anything sensible using this application. You should get a good quality stylus to fully utilize the capabilities of this application. The ability to use existing photos and adding text was nice feature but somehow I did not find enough fonts other than 'Sans'. Not sure if that is my tablet's limitation or the application's limitation.<br /><br />Overall I am rating this with 4 stars instead of 5 because of including 'flurry' analytics in a paid application.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|Good mental exercise and fun. Kids would like this as well and would be a good mental practice for math class
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Howey has crafted a fascinating post-apocalyptic world with memorable characters, riveting action, and just the right amount of levity, all built on this premise: “how badly do you want to know the truth... and are you willing to die for it?\\"<br /><br />It might be tempting to pigeon-hole this book into the genre of sci-fi, but resist; it's more than that. It's an action-adventure, a love story, a political thriller all rolled into one.<br /><br />I can't recommend it highly enough.
B00EUS9JF0|2.0|Love Paul but wish he would slow down and write like he use to! Sounds over processed with  \\"Someones Knockin at the door\\" depth to the lyrics. Flaming Pie blows this one way out of the water.  Critics You can Love Paul without praising everything he does, after all he was once half of the Greatest writing team in musical history! Compared to Paul This ain't Paul!
B0063IH60K|4.0|But hate some of the lengthy ads.  I understand ads but advertisers should. Realize the longer they interrupt the game the less likely WE are to buy or use their products
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Can't really complain given the cost of the device.  However I do wish the device had more uses other than casting Netflix or youtube.  It did a barely satisfactory job at casting a browser page with flash content, the sound kept playing in the chrome browser and there was a lag between the video and the sound.<br /><br />I've had this for over a month and like my title indicated it was cool for a few days, now its just connected to the TV.<br /><br />Hope Google will start releasing updates to make this more useful.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Rod Stewart does it agin with a compilation of wonderful songs.  The music is easy listening with beautiful lyrics. Just an overall winner.
140006922X|5.0|When books are bought outside of kindle. I usually buy them. I like to search for certain books that interest me at certain times. Zealot was in good condition..
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I think the series is great! They get into quite a bit of detail, but it pays off with patience. The 2 I've read so far are both page turners.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|And the epic saga continues...great new characters, a larger than life sweep, cracking dialogue and a story unfolds with great pace.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Highly recommended this game! One of the BEST games I have EVER played! It puts your brain to work.............good brain exercise.
B008QYT7DI|5.0|My son and I loved this story. This is an enjoyable story to read, and one of the best parts was that reading it prompted my son's imagination.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Very good Stephen King super natural story but the real reason to read this book is the character development. Each of the major characters tells a different story and each is worth getting to know. This makes the book a five star read.
B00DAPOHU6|5.0|Album is a delight.  Jack's voice is great for story telling within his songs, and the lyrics of this music is sometimes poignant, sometimes loving, and sometimes simply clever.
0307987698|5.0|I bought this book because I remembered having it as a kid and thought I'd get it to share with my kids. Never did I imagine the thrills that they get from it every time I read it to them. It has been the most requested book - they can't get enough of it, but I think that also has something to do with me being a complete lunatic when I read it to them, they love it - and I love that they love it so much!!!
B0027MJU00|4.0|This is the second book I have read by this author and I like her style.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good drama.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I mostly like the clock face on this app.  Much nicer than the one that came with my device. The alarm works well and the weather is accurate compared to the weather app.  Apps are fun!
B00DV2D0JC|4.0|This game was longer and more involved than I thought it would be, which is really good. The puzzles are fun, a few are challenging, and the seek and find/puzzle fun is varied nicely. Enjoyed it!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What a great and entertaining series! Lots of exciting drama. I can't wait for season 4 to start in January.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|The novel was a great one.  This got me started with the Lee Child series.  Was glad they made one movie so far and hope that all the books are turned into movies.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|I enjoyed the book a lot.  I'm always trying to figure out the plot and never quite get in.  Maybe someday I will.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|There is mission to beat just like temple run its alot fun to play. There great color and theme to it. Have fun!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I think this game is very complex, it's a good challenge. I get frustrated when I get stuck, and very excited when I move on to the next level. I really like that you can get more lives without paying for them. There should be more games that allow you to do what candy crush saga lets you do.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I like it a lot I think its superb for a free game but still wish everything was free but overall its very fun and addictive
B00EUS9JF0|4.0|Like the modernistic neon bars used to indicate the \\"New\\" title, Paul McCartney steps up to the new world of modern-ish music and applies a sheen and glow to his newest collection of pop-tunes. While \\"Memory Almost Full\\" seemed like a coda to a long career and well lived life and \\"Kisses From The Bottom\\" had a wiff of the old-fogy about it, \\"New\\" tosses that aside and finds McCartney still willing to challenge his younger contemporaries, down to having hot-shot Mark Ronson produce a few selections, in particular, the buoyant title track.<br /><br />The lead-off, \\"Save Us,\\" is a rocker in the Wings mold, without the annoyance of \\"Nod Your Head\\" (from \\"Memory\\") or the screaming mania of \\"Cut Me Some Slack,\\" the song Paul recorded with the surviving members of Nirvana. Yes, despite the willingness to go out on the occasional limb, \\"New\\" is an album that is eager to please, even if it doesn't play its hand as a totally safe one. In that aspect, it's reminiscent of \\"Flaming Pie,\\" one of Paul's best from the 90's. Which also means that there's a shout out to his days as a Liverpool youngster on \\"Early Days,\\" where he tells those who have romanticized The Beatles too much for his tastes by stating \\"I don't see how they can remember/When they weren't where it was at.\\"<br /><br />McCartney certainly isn't above a little cheekiness, as \\"Early Days\\" and the buzzy \\"Queenie Eye\\" show. And who would have thought Paul still had time for a little lyrical nonsense like the clever \\"Alligator?\\" It's also a pleasant surprise to hear the keyboard driven \\"Road,\\" which is the haunting final song before the uncredited song \\"Scared.\\" \\"I'm still too scared to tell you...the simplest of words won't come out of my mouth, though I'm dying to set them free,\\" he croons in the way only McCartney can in \\"Scared\\". That McCartney can still be so emotionally naked and willing to try and challenge himslef in the way \\"New\\" does is a pretty remarkable feat for a man making music for over 50 years.
B007T8BYWE|3.0|I always like playing this game.  My only &quot;complaint&quot; is I wish there were more levels in each download.  It's over before I know it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I enjoying streaming video from my phone or laptop to my TV with this. It is very easy to use once this is set up and reliable. quick delivery and good packaging. thanks
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|Not a whole lot to say about the game.  It is a very good game that reminds me a lot of the games I grew up playing.
B00EDOS6IC|1.0|They are capable of much better.  I pass on the whole album.  Album never had a chance due to bad production......vocals and music sound at odds with each other.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|This is the first time I have ever felt the need to write my opinion. I have read fictional fantasy books by dozens and dozens of authors. Some I love, some were OK, some I didn't really take to, and I think that is simply quite normal. But this book is leagues worse than any I have ever read. The contradictions within the story line are countless,  didn't the author make notes???? It is rushed, not one character is explored, it leaps from standard fantasy to a level of absolute ludicrous writing, from one page to the next.  A group of half a dozen 14 year olds with less than 4 months of training slaughtering over 100 vicious elite warriors?? I mean, it is just way too ludicrous to be taken as a serious fantasy novel. I have read books 1 - 8, a complete and utter waist of time.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|The app downloaded and installed on my Archos 43 tablet, but every time I open it the app fails to finish loading.  I get a screen with a \\"King\\" logo and the word loading for a few seconds, then the app quits altogether.
B003F29D44|5.0|Amazing movie. Better than the sequel.<br />Also reflects the spirit of 1980's NYC.<br />I find it a bit too left politically, which is expected from Oliver Stone.<br />Other than this a true masterpiece.
B000002H72|4.0|After losing my original, I knew I had to get another.  This is so good.  I am happy again. :D
B00C2C637I|4.0|The story is great, but it seems like they scanned in the original text to use for this digital copy because there are some odd typos in the text.  Annoying for the price paid for a digital book when I could get a hard copy for about the same amount of money. It is also distracting when reading the book.
0446699616|4.0|John Corey, an Antiterrorist Task Force Agent, and his FBI Agent wife, Kate Mayfield, are posted to Yemen.  Their mission is to track down a high-ranking Al Queda bad guy known as The Panther.  In case your geography is rusty, Yemen is bordered on the north by Saudi Arabia and the east by Oman.  John and Kate are actually bait to bring The Panther out of hiding so they and their CIA and State Department teammates can eliminate him.<br /> Nelson DeMille has written about our two protagonists before in The Lion's Game and The Lion.  I read The Lion several years ago and was anxious to see what Corey and Mayfield were doing again to thwart the plans of Middle-East terrorists.<br /> DeMille has constructed an elaborate plot with plenty of surprises along the way.  The book is rather long for a paperback and weighs in at 625 pages.  Probably a good idea to hold it firmly in your hands and not drop it on your foot.  The first two hundred pages are rather slow going because it's all buildup for Corey and Mayfield's mission to Yemen but the excitement and tension build steadily, along with double and triple crosses that keep you guessing about what's going to happen next.  The final one hundred or so pages are so tension-filled that you will have to finish it no matter what.<br /> On the negative side, John Corey is always making smart-ass remarks either out loud or to himself.  He's a street-smart New York ex-homicide detective but after a couple hundred pages it gets tiresome and occasionally annoying.  At first I wasn't sure whether Corey was making these comments to counteract his nervousness or internal fears but later I concluded that it's just the way he acts.  The other negative about this book is the author's treatment of Kate Mayfield.  She's Corey's partner in this adventure but takes a back seat to the men during the planning and action.  Even when she's in Yemen with the counter-terrorist team, she takes a minor role, admittedly because of a woman's status in a Muslim culture, but it makes one wonder why she is even involved in the first place.  A legal purpose is given about why she's along for the ride and there's also a later plot point concerning her past relation with another CIA agent.  It's a clever device by DeMille to use an event from one of his earlier books and add spice to the stew.<br /> Without giving away the plot, Demille leaves himself plenty of wiggle room to entertain us in the future about Corey, Mayfield, and others who've survived the violent ending of this book.Muslim culture, but it makes one wonder why she is even involved in the first place.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Well worth the wait! Love to play it and help my friends. Thank you for the availability. Woot woot woot
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|That says it all I have just started candy it keeps you on your toes, I think I have just about  figured it out then  I find out I don't know it at all. It is a great game. Enjoy.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is so cool. I play this game at my aunt's house and I love it. Way to cool
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is awesome!!!Love it Love It Love it!!!It says it's for 9 and up but the only thing that is for adults is the blood when your shark eats!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally able to play the game on the Kindle!! Super excited over this!!! No issues at all with the app. Wondering if we'll be able to get pet rescue saga made by the same maker as candy crush.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|The actors are great and the story is lovely. We are using Amazon because we can keep track of what we watch and what we want to watch. On the TV we have to wait a week for a new one and it does not always show during our TV time.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I loved this book it was amazing so many things happen that you do not expect to ok choose this rating because this is this only book to ever have actually caused me to physically cry tears were actually running down my face and I absolutly loved this book
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I received the dvds and I am very well pleased with the performance of the product.  I dont like filling out these reviews. I just wanted the product, got it and I am happy. I would only want and need to respond if there were something wrong or if i were not happy.Thank you.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is intense and brings out all kinds of emotions in me.  Happiness, frustration, anger and anticipation.  It is a good thing when you fail a level that the game shuts down for a number of minutes to allow you to calm yourself down and plan a new strategy.  I am stuck right now, so heelllppp!!
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Rocket punches in the face!<br />I feel like I took a shower with the alien saliva and hydraulic oils! That stickiness!<br />Between Grotesque and action, Del Toro catches the point of the old Japanese movies, and colored it with his own imagination.<br /><br />Who's arguing about reality here? Sorry, you've got the wrong address.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I am a life long Stephen King fan and I am enjoying this book. Bringing back Dan Torence was a wonderful idea. If you are a King fan, this is a good book.  Enjoy
1904994679|5.0|This book is much better than the 2011 Guinness World Records, or the 2010 for that matter. New family favorite!
B0000AK7AA|5.0|Awesome movie for Halloween. Or anytime of the year! Its a classic can't wait to share it with the family.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|its aways fun to eat people and other fish. I love you have to download this app its so miluch fun on my kindle fire
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I LOVED Divergent and Insurgent so much that I read both several times. I even loved Roth's unique style, which many have criticized. I was deeply disappointed by the general plot and especially the ending of Allegiant. I feel as though my trust has been abused and I will never invest my time and energy in any future books by Roth.
B000002LND|5.0|When Madonna first came out, I dismissed her as a pop artist with no staying power.  Over time, I realized that I actually liked all of her songs.  I bought this for pure nostalgia and it really made me feel good to hear of of these songs again.  Not one bad song in the bunch!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It was a good read over-all except for a few parts that was a little too convoluted and took too long to get the point across
B005GP7F8Y|1.0|The movie was all in German. I don't speak or read German. It was a gift and by the time I gave it to a relative the return policy had expired.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been anxiously waiting for kindle to offer candy crush, it was sooo worth the wait!!!! I've had no problems with this game whatsoever.
006202406X|1.0|I cannot believe the ending of this book. Had I known what was going to happen, I would NOT have read it. I didn't spend the money on a book to be depressed when it was over. I want a RE-WRITE!!
B00BUNQOOM|5.0|It's been over 20 years since the last Del Lords CD and they were sorely missed. Scott and the band have made a classic rock n roll cd. The production by Eric is flawless. How a great song like When the drugs kick in is not being played on the airwaves everywhere is puzzling. Buy this CD NOW!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I am also an Mahjong addict, love it ! Keeps me thinking, thank you for a great game Lots of fun to play.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|A bit gory but a good story nonetheless.<br />That's pretty much it I like the character development as well. Cool.
B00F6CLNKI|5.0|EWF has never disappointed me, recorded or in person. I love them. They are truly the best. Inspirational, true musicians.
B003G4W49C|5.0|A fantastic story about turning a brilliant kid into a matter tactician. Definitely worth the read. I would recommend it.
B001AH6ZWY|3.0|I really like the movie, but it never really seems to live up to what one would expect. Somehow it seems to be a let down. Great cast, great premise, fun topic.
B00E5N8E6K|5.0|An outstanding performance by Def Leppard!  I wish we could have gone to Las Vegas to see the show earlier this year but this DVD was the next best thing!  We enjoyed watching it, loved the bonus videos of the \\"opening act\\" too!  This DVD is a must have!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The author has lost her mind she took an interesting thrill_seeking series and turned it into an emo angst ridden mess. Do not waste your money if you liked the first two and pretend it ended there. The ending is of course the worst but the whole book is so far from the series that a bi-polar author seems the only explnation. So you literally drag and trudge through the whole book only hoping for a glimmer of the first two only to be so dissapointed with the ending that you wish you never started.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This fantasy book, for adults, brought to life the magic of an alternate universe with the same breathless pacing and attention to detail as the Harry Potter books did for me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's the best game ever.I could play for more than 5 hours it's got to be played by millions and millions of people
B00BAXFCPO|4.0|I've known that I was gluten sensitive, but David Perlmutter paints a more sinister picture of what's going on in our bodies while we are eating processed foods that are pushed on us at every turn, from almost every market, restaurant, or school cafeteria.  I've changed my diet accordingly.
B003VANOFY|1.0|Title is self-explanatory, all parts broke. First the battery died on me and after replacing it, the second battery died within a week. The charging station also broke.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I loved The Shining, it's one of my favorites of King's books, and the sequel does not disappoint.  A fun (scary) read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad to finally get this on my kindle! Much more fun to play on bigger screen. Great thing for winding down.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Stephen King wanted to explore/create a boy character's future, and I was interested enough to go along for the ride. By and large it was a fairly entertaining ride. I've often enjoyed KIng's stories and particularly admire his deft pacing and seamless flow. You know you're in expert hands when you're reading along and lose yourself in a thing enough to forget that you're reading it. This tale carries you inside. You read sixty pages, check your watch, and are mildly surprised to find that an hour has passed. So why didn't I give this one five stars? Press on here if you don't mind a bit of a spoiler.<br /><br />It was the finale. Somehow, those soul-sucking antagonists King was so good at fleshing out (and then de-fleshing) didn't put up enough fight for me in the end. He had a whole pack chanting devilish Hell and planning to avenge their early losses and then - whoops - half of them faded out with an outbreak of measles...Measles? Ummm...Gosh. I guess I like my supernatural villains made of sturdier stuff. As for Rose the Hat - she wasn't all that. Big build up plus easy defeat equals four stars for me. Same thing happened to me with Duma Key. As I read it I thought it might make my top ten favorite novels, but the last two or three chapters involving the big supernatural showdown were a let down. Well, I hope this author will keep at it despite his weak conclusions. I believe he has a successful future ahead of him.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Absolutely one of the best games I've played on a mobile device EVER. Amazingly fun but too short. I loved it. Looking forward to the next one.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|While I can still see more on a big screen, the Android app has a feature I've been hoping for forever and it's not on the computer app.  It tells me how much I have to read in a chapter.<br />When I'm reading, after I finish a chapter, I'd like to know how long the next chapter is so I can decide whether to read it or put it down. Easy in a book. Impossible on the Kindle without messing up my forward progress.<br />Now it tells me how much is left in the chapter at the bottom of each page.<br />It says it in minutes rather than pages. I'm not sure why. Pages make more sense, but it say it, and that works beautifully.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Once I started playing this game, I didn't want to stop. I play every chance I get. It gets more challenging with each new level.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|We have MLP on our Ipad too. So it was easy to add it to our Kindle. We like to play the game. They have gotten the social aspect fixed. But the only thing that I find frustration is the gems. Everything cost massive amounts of gems. We don't like to make purchases to games if we can help it so we find that we have a harder time completing the some of the tasks. Also we find that getting the elements of harmony is VERY difficult. So your ponyville is often times overrun by Parasprites. They said they fixed this so that you would only get parasprites IF you had the elements to take care of them. Still waiting for that to happen. I wish there were more ways to earn the gems and elements. Then we would be looking at 5 stars. Despite the &#34;issues&#34; listed above we truly do enjoying the game and playing with the ponies.
B00A757EFW|3.0|This game is hard to play without the joystick. I loved this game when i was a kid but im not to fond of it on my tablet.
B00EHMG358|5.0|It's great so far. I'm looking forward to the rest of it. I have read every book by these authors and have loved each one.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|First of all, I have to say, if you are writing a review and have a spoiler, even if you write \\"spoiler\\" you NEED to leave some room before you spoil!!!<br /><br />Yes, the first two books were amazing, heart thumping, couldn't put down books. This one, not so much. It did answer those questions we were left hanging with after book 2, but I have to say, not in the most satisfying, interesting way. I was expecting something a bit more fleshed out and elaborate than what was. Something a bit more grand and stunning. Also, I have to agree with another reviewer who wrote about the alternating narrative. Tris and Tobias' voices were not distinctly different from one another. At times, I couldn't remember who was speaking until they mentioned the other, so that was a bit annoying. Overall, though, it was a satisfying ending to the series. I wouldn't say neatly tied up in a bow at the end, but we weren't left with any loose ends.<br />I think the people who are giving the book bad reviews are reviewing emotionally, and not on the book's merits. Allegiant is well, written, just not as exciting.<br />SPOILER<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />I was so mad when I saw that other reviewer's comment that confirmed my suspicion of the ending!! I had predicted the outcome based on the alternating POV and also from a bit of foreshadowing toward the beginning. Still!!! C'mon people!! No one wants the book ruined!
B00EDUTGB2|5.0|this app works very well.  I can print to my printer from anywhere.  I would reccomend this app to anyone who has an HP printer.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|Great aggregation of multiple sources of information...unfortunately biased towards US media sources...for example hardly any coverage of Cricket... a game followed by over a billion people.
1933952806|5.0|Great book to help you learn your camera body. Another great job by Mr. young! This is a very easy to understand book.
B000089CPF|5.0|Somewhere between Ry Cooder and Raidohead is Feast of wire. Lush soundscape strings, horns, Lap Steel, western movie sound track one second full on Jazz the next. The crunching sound of  &#34;black heart&#34; the Groan of &#34;Whipping the horse's eyes&#34; the CD takes you on ride that you want to take over and over again.
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|The only drawback to this game is that it doesn't sense when no further moves can be made but since there is no limit on lives you can just restart the level. This game is not my favorite game but it is the one I play the most for several reasons. There is no limit on how many times you can play and there is no waiting between turns or levels, etc. There are no huge ads, no pop ups wanting you to make in app purchases, no requests to connect with facebook. Just puzzle after puzzle and turn after turn for as long as you want to play. I have noticed that after hours and hours of playing that the squares don't quite line up with the touch reception. When this happens I exit out of the app and come back later and it's fine. I might be pushing it too much. I have the new HDx so these screen being a bit off might be related to that model only but I've only experienced it on this app. This game is an excellent value for the price.
B00FF5SXB8|5.0|I was thinking I might not like this series, but it's grown on me a lot as the season progressed.  I look forward to new episodes now.
B00CH26TL8|2.0|This game sounds fun but it doesn't work quite right on the HDx. If I shoot the correct color bubbles, sometimes they pop and sometimes it sticks as if I hit the wrong color. I can immediately (if the same color bubble comes up) shoot again without changing the direction at all and the bubbles *might* drop, might stick. It's too frustrating to play since it randomly works or not. I've cobbled my way up to level 8 but won't be playing it anymore. Disappointing.
0385350864|4.0|My first shock at this book was that Bridget is in her 50s...but a quick glance at the calendar reminded me that I am too. My, how time has flown since the first Bridget Jones novel! Aren't we both still 35?<br /><br />In quality, this book is somewhere in between the first book (sheer chick lit perfection) and Edge of Reason (horrid). I would have given 3.5 stars if allowed.<br /><br />About the first third of the book, I was torn between laughing at the depictions of motherhood (I too am a mom who works at home writing, so I could relate to her endless distractions) and sadness at the loss of Mark. The tone of the book was also uneven as it was hard to go from funny scenes to the gut-wrenching memories that Bridget has to deal with. These were very accurately depicted, so much so that it was hard to come out of them again and go on reading.<br /><br />Then suddenly the book clicked for me and I began liking it.<br /><br />I did feel that sometimes, Bridget was too immature for her age, and her actions seemed unrealistic even for her (as when she can't concentrate in an important meeting because she is texting with her boyfriend under the table. Really?). But Fielding always seemed to bring her back to reality when dealing with the children, and in the end, I felt that most of her actions, while not necessarily something I would do, were true to the character.<br /><br />Overall, I felt this was a good pick-up to the story, and I was extremely satisfied with how it all turned out in the end. I really just love this character so much that it was great to spend time with her again. (I still can't believe she's 50....)
B00E00GCF8|5.0|Truly amazing show from some really incredible fellas! I would recommend this DVD live performance to all my friends!<br />Thanx guys!<br />James
B008JFURKG|5.0|Somehow RED 2 seemed better than the the first RED. I found that hard to believe, but I think this one is better. It is slick, well scripted, well paced, it has great character depth and the action is intense, suspenseful, full of energy and just incredible. It all works. It all comes together. Both RED and RED 2 are incredibly well made great films. RED 2 really impressed me. And I am glad it did. I thought the story was well thought out and developed. All these elements make RED 2 an edge of your seat entertainment. I love the cast and the camaraderie. Every element works. RED 2 is edge of your seat entertainment.
B00EJOCB4G|1.0|I am so disappointed. I spent 36.96 on a micro-world, not knowing what a micro-world was. This box fits in the palm of my hand. definitely not worth 36.96! Maybe if it was bigger.I will not be buying the other sets like I was planning.
B004SVM7BW|4.0|Love the interface. If I were to be a bit picky, I would say that it's a bit clunky after some relatively extensive highlighting. And it has frozen once or twice. But it is an AMAZING tool relative to the old fashioned post-it note and hi-lite method.
B0095VPBM2|4.0|Does just what I want it to do. Cant beat the price.Didn't need to spend extra for Intel. Wanted this build to be basic.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Good game very amusing only thing is you need more energy to begin with take a little bit to get use to the controls
0307352145|5.0|I would recomend this book to anyone interested in understanding themselves and others better. Easy style with a lot of valuable insights. Do yourself a favour and read it.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a good way to challenge yourself...great brain game. Lots of fun...glad I got it as game of the day
B003QCCS36|4.0|A must for laid back country fans. Ray has a great voice and a solid collection of songs. Good value
1451695195|4.0|Near Death Experiences (NDEs) are a fascinating topic.  They affect people regardless of cultural background or religious belief, or lack of it, and they've been recorded from the earliest days of civilisation.  For years science has suggested explanations for the tunnel, the white light, the dead relatives waiting to greet you, and all the other familiar markers of an NDE.  But whether dumps of DMT from the pineal gland, primitive brainstem programs or toxic overstimulation of cortical neurons, those theories have all been found wanting as we have discovered more about what really happens to the brain under the threat of death.<br /><br />If you had to suggest what would make the best case study of an NDE, it would involve: a skeptical patient, someone who was an expert in neuroscience, and a situation where there were extremely detailed records of what was happening to brain chemistry at the point of death.  By the laws of chance, that is never going to happen...<br /><br />Except here it did.  Eben Alexander is a leading neurosurgeon with a well-documented career of writing and teaching about neuroscience in leading institutions.  He was also a confirmed materialist and a skeptic of anything spiritual - even of the notion that consciousness existed beyond a mechanical construct of the brain's processing of experience and memory.<br /><br />And then Alexander was struck down by a rare and seemingly incurable form of bacterial meningitis that threw him into a coma.  The doctors at the hospital where he worked gave him less than a ten per cent chance of survival, and even if he did pull through he was expected to be irretrievably brain-damaged.  Finally they advised his family to turn off life support.<br /><br />Yet against all the odds, Alexander did wake up, and with all his faculties intact.  And he came back with a staggering account of an NDE that is all the more powerful because it could not...should not...be.  His detailed medical records show that there was no activity in his brain that could possibly have accounted for what he experienced - in effect, the human, thinking part of him was dead.<br /><br />The unique case study alone is worth the four stars - it's an important account in the study of NDEs.  The book itself, for me, probably deserves three.  It's easy reading - no doubt because Alexander wanted to convey his experiences to the widest possible audience - but I would have preferred some more analytical writing and less visceral or emotional.<br /><br />Having said that, Proof of Heaven is worth reading because of the confluence of Alexander's scientific background and the life-changing experience he underwent, one which kicked away all the props of the intellectual life he'd built over his years in science.no activity in his brain that could possibly have accounted for what he experienced - in effect, the human, thinking part of him was dead.<br /><br />The unique case study alone is worth the four stars - it's an important account in the study of NDEs.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|This did not end up to be anything other than porn with a loosely write  story.  Very disappointed in the book.
B009MYAQOA|5.0|Fascinating.<br />Lot's of areas for discussion. Wonderful descriptions of nature as well as events.<br />Didn't want it to end. Interesting research by author
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|This is the ultimate pop culture cancer book, and everyone loves it so of course it came highly recommended.<br /><br />Here's what I loved about it:<br /><br />*The language. John Green writes a mean descriptive passage, and he does capture much of the essence of the cancer experience in this book. He also neatly weaved star metaphors and references throughout the pages.<br />*The references to philosophers. This is one of the smartest young adult novels that I've seen on the market.<br />*Hazel is not as insipid as Bella.<br /><br />Here's what I didn't love about it:<br /><br />*The protagonist is a caricature, and so are the rest of the characters. None of them felt real to me.<br />*The ending- and not for the reason you'd think. I was highly disappointed that over and over again, the author referred to the ending of another book, and then chose not to write the ending that way. I was strongly hoping he continued those references into something meaningful. He didn't.<br /><br />Having multiple people in my life that have died of cancer meant that I teared up once during my reading of this book; however, it was no thanks to the characters. The best bits of the book are the soliloquizing, and being a fan of Tom Robbins I can certainly appreciate that. This book would have had more depth without the plot, as a simpler writing on the emotions and thoughts involved with cancer - however, without the love story, the masses wouldn't have bought it. Well played, Mr. Green.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy they finally have the game for Kindle! It's better than playing it on my phone! Thanks Amazon!  :)
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Just a great read; brought back the memories from The Shining and made for a fitting answer to the question &#34;whatever happened to Danny Torrence?&#34;.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Some games keep you way to long on them some people don't live that long . Your reviews have to be tooo long also

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Quick download and install to my kindle fire hd. Now I understand why everyone is playing this game. As a match three player this is exactly what I like. Not too hard but enough of a challenge to keep it interesting.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|I am enjoying the series.  Based on this book I will continue to read the series. Exceeded all my expectations.
B00847KFDS|5.0|Voice is still great, Pure nowadays Creedence. Takes me  back to the golden years of pure music, real rock and roll. Creedence Clearwater Revival forever in John Fogerty.

B007EC27QM|5.0|Works great, looks even better on my Galaxy Note 2. Recommended to sister, we both got it free app of the day.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Gripping, makes me proud.  This is my first book of an account during Afghanistan / Pakistan campaign, the heroism exhibited reminds me of black hawk down.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I am a long-time fan of Stephen King starting from the days he wrote a column for the University of Maine newspaper called the Garbage Truck.  So it pains me to be less than enthusiastic about &#34;11/22/63&#34;, but I am.  I've always enjoyed King's writing style--the best description  I can come up with is &#34;sophisticated chatty&#34;.  Unfortunately, I'd characterize 11/22/63 as &#34;simple chatty&#34;. It was too methodical and transparent.  Plus, King, in my opinion does not write women well, and a woman is a main character in 11/22/63.  He does, however, do a great job bringing Marina Oswald to life.  I wished he'd spent more pages on the gatekeepers of the time bubble....But, I finished it and was glad I read it.
B00EVCD9HY|5.0|AH-MAY-ZING!!! Janelle Monae never disappoints! I like that there were some new sounds and directions from her. Great album! Buy it!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Fun show with some odd events. Love the unpredictable character of Walter and the father son interaction. Will continue to watch and enjoy :D
B00DBOF5Q6|4.0|Richard Flanagan has crafted the story 'Narrow road to the deep north' to show us life in a POW camp where the men were expected to clear and build a railway in Thailand. The brutality of their treatment from starvation to beatings all fit in with the Japanese way of acting. They beat each other, the Koreans, as well as the POWs. The main character is a doctor, Dorrigo Evans, whose life before embarking was pleasant and dangerous, with his uncle's wife. His life afterwards was empty of love and I suspect, he suffered from PTSD. Will he meet Amy or even make the effort? It is a long journey.
B008TRUDAS|1.0|I found this book to be immature and poorly written, as if the author was scrambling to finish it.  It was not intriguing, the heroine's role was shallow.  It was not well researched or the author would have known that heavy snowfalls do not occur in Ypsilanti, Michigan in September. . Other readers couldn't wait for the sequel (will it be another book written in a hurry?) but I couldn't wait for this book to end.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great acting, great story lines, and quirky characters. It's very good about building suspense at the last moment, to make you want to watch the next episode!
B003LSTK8G|5.0|This book was fun to read, and filled in a lot of blanks regarding what the sub-prime mortgage crisis actually meant, how it came about, and where the blame for it goes.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Pleasantly surprised at this album.  Solid Sabbath through and through.  Would highly recommend this to any Sabbath fan out there.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|A blend of rhythms with a blend of backing vocals by Martin G. and extraordinary lyrics a most have by fans and new generation!
0525478817|2.0|This isn't one of my usual reads. Usually I don't gravitate towards books that are about cancer, it's just taken too many people from me. I don't want to go through that heartache again, even if it's for a fictional character. But when this book came up on the list for my book club, I was pretty intrigued.<br /><br />The book is pretty well written, the characters were well thought out and their path/destiny was an interesting journey. I thought that the naked honesty about facing and living with death was admirable. I appreciated the light humor sprinkled throughout and I also enjoyed the bittersweet moments of humor and sadness that really touched my heart.<br /><br />I really liked the part where Gus was saving the world (which is what two of my friends call playing military-ish video games) and he saved some kids in the game and said \\"my life bought them a minute and that's not nothing\\". That really resonated with me - every minute is so important.<br /><br />There was one character that drove me absolutely nuts. I didn't like this character at all and even though the book was based almost completely around him, I found parts of his involvement in the book to just be a waste of time. Why was the book hinged on this character? I keep thinking that if some of his interactions with Hazel had been different, it would have changed the tone of the book and it may have changed the lackluster ending for me.<br /><br />I'm always in constant search for a novel that has two things: I want a flawed main character, I want them to be so messed up that I almost can't stand them because you usually get to see this amazing character transformation/growth happen during a novel. I think it's pretty damn close to magic to watch those transformations happen and a great author can make it almost seamless. The second is for a book to make me feel. I don't care what it is... love, hate, disgust, admiration... it doesn't matter, just make me feel. This book delivered the first but I thought it fell short on making me feel.<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong, it was sad but it didn't break me down and I think I was waiting for that. I expected for this to have a gut-wrenching ending and when it didn't, I felt a bit let down. And that just kind of ruined ... everything for me. I think that an ending can make or break a book and this ending didn't do the book justice at all for me.<br /><br />All of that being said, it's being turned into a movie and while I don't feel compelled to see it now, I probably will get it on Netflix because I have to see how all of the characters are portrayed and see if maybe I was wrong about any of them.ought it fell short on making me feel.<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong, it was sad but it didn't break me down and I think I was waiting for that.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love puzzle games. Many are too easy and a few are hands down impossible. This one is just right! Sometimes you know what to do with what you find. Sometimes you don't. The clues are helpful without being too helpful. This was free for me today, but if you see it for $1.99 tomorrow, it will be money well spent.
B00B1EEKM8|5.0|I worked on the movie... Now I get to see it in Blu-Ray ( high Rez) on my computer when ever I want to<br />relive the days gone by. It reminds me of seeing it in the theater. Blu-Ray.. Ya got to love it!

B003YL4LYI|5.0|I loved it! Martin always keeps you on your toes and wanting more. I was loathed to put it down.  Definitely a must-read.
B00EP2PXCY|5.0|Almost 30 year old woman and can listen to this cd from beginning to end. Didn't know who she was until my daughter explained who she was (actress from nickelodeon) and that she had a song in the radio. Her voice is like an angel and I even confuse her with Mariah Carey sometimes from back in the day. Very nice cd. You will be pleased.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Dont get me wrong..there isnt an avenged sevenfold record i dont like (except sounding the seventh trumpet).  i think hail to the king is awesome, i absolutely love nightmare and the self titled is a great album.  but...i always find myself going back to waking the fallen.  such an epic, lush sound that is unmatched by and album released in the last decade.  vocals are phenomenal, solos are mesmerizing, drums are blast beat, song structures keep you guessing, and there isnt a single filler track to be found.  from beginning to end...this is one of the greatest rock/metal albums of all time.
B0084AYLK8|4.0|A masterly character study based around a handful of main protagonists in a close knit village and near surroundings described vividly with a wonderful technique that keeps you  reading through.
B005FDW7AI|4.0|Good movie! My 2, 8 and hubby all liked it. Hubby actually put up with it, but that says a lot!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I really hope that there is a chance for an alternate ending. I wish I would have known how this book was to turn out and I would have stopped at the end of insurgent. Loved the first two books. Saying it's my favorite series in the YA...now definitely not.<br />I know writers write what they see and feel. Can't blame her for that. I just wish she would have kept her fans in mind when writing the ending. Why make people hate you and hate the last book of a good series??  I could go on for days. What good will it do?  Nothing. Absolutely no good.
1476727651|5.0|Excellent! Great Stephen King novel. Fans of his will not be disappointed. If you'be always wondered what became of little Danny here's your answer.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I, like many others, discovered the series through it's HBO series, Game of Thrones. Books 1 and 2 were followed, by HBO, closely and pretty accurately. Book 3, however, &#34;goes&#34; quite a bit further, along the story, than did season 3 of the series. I'd planned to hold off the reading of book 4, until I'd first watched season 4, and etc. (for some reason, I enjoy a series AND books when i FIRST watch, then read. and am able to, more easily, accept when they differ. but when i watch something AFTER i've read its &#34;source material,&#34; I'm often disappointed (and angered!) when the tv series doesn't follow along, accurately!) Since I couldn't just STOP reading book 3, even though I was learning SHOCKING facts that weren't, yet, shown, in the TV series, I am steaming along, through the rest of the books! I hope I still love HBO's Game of Thrones, when it returns, in season 4! (wow...reading my thoughts, &#34;aloud,&#34; makes me feel a little crazy!)

B00B1E6FF8|4.0|I thought the film was well done. The acting is first rate and the story apparently was near to the truth. It's tragic that Seal Team Six lost members when a helo was attacked by insurgents.  Knowing the ending did not interfere with enjoying the film overall. Thumbs up!

B00BIVN82M|5.0|If you enjoy Michael Buble as I do you will be delighted with this CD.  It is a mixture of contemporary and classical popular songs.  I found the CD to be very pleasing and another success for Michael Buble.
B000S56EYS|5.0|One of the best blues songs.  I also love &#34;Parisiene Walkways&#34; by Gary Moore. That one is another great song.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|Seriously Veronica Roth? Seriously? This book is filled with so many plot holes its not even funny. I am shocked that this book got past her friends, family, editors and publishers. The it was a babbling mess. Four was unrecognizable, our strong, brave Four turned into a scared insecure little girl. I don't even care about the stupid for shock ending, I actually dig books that have tragic endings but this was clearly a ploy to make this book about something in the last chapters of the book. She introduced a conflict within a conflict within a conflict... give me a break. This book felt incredibly  immature. I am shocked and disappointed. After spending the last few years talking this book up and waiting patiently for the conclusion I feel ripped off. If this is the quality of her writing now I will never read another book by Veronica Roth again.

B00EAH3GHI|5.0|THIS CONCERT DVD IS REALLY GOOD, AND THE SPECIAL FEATURES AWESOME, TO SEE KURT, CHRIS, DAVE, AND PAT IN THAT REHEARSAL YOU CAN FEEL THE GRUNGE ALIVE AGAIN.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I like this game. I just got it and have only played a couple levels, but it's fun so far. Good graphics..
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|While not as good as Abrams first twist on the classic Star Trek universe, this movie still offers some cute twists and turns.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|This is an awesome wee device and the app is awesome too.<br />I like being able to see how my overall health measures up. It keeps me motivated.<br />I do, however, think it can be a bit inaccurate - especially the sleep monitor - but I am happy with the indication of how I am going that it gives me.<br />I don't really get how the MyFitnessPal link works as the info is very different on the Withings App to what MFP App says. I don love that you can link MFP though, and My Run Keeper. It is so helpful!<br />I would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for those few things that I think don't work as smoothly as they could.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|This page turner is an anti utopia written by a modern H.G Wells. It carries the extreme addiction to social media into a fantasy of a company that destroys privacy in the name of democracy and sharing.
B0031RSBS2|5.0|Another great Lee child book ....he always leaves one guessing right until the end.....hope there are many more Jack Reacher books.
B00CLVEPFC|5.0|This is an AWESOME movie and I truly enjoyed it!  It has extra footage not seen in movies and it kicks butt! It's loaded with adventure and action and the female lead was great. It's a great addition to your movie collection.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love that I can now play Candy Crush on my Kindle Fire! I can play faster than on my pc!!!
006202406X|5.0|I understand why many readers are very upset at the ending. They have certain expectations for the genre this trilogy was slated in, and this book disappointed those expectations.<br /><br />However, I am dark and twisted and love endings like this. I knew this was coming about halfway through the book and anticipated it with emotional tremors. I feel the ending and the choices the characters made followed logically from their personalities, back grounds, and growth. I was particularly appreciative that the conflicts the characters faced were rooted in harsh realities, not superficial misunderstandings.<br /><br />I desperately hope the reception for this book doesn't inhibit Roth's career or desire to write. Her ability to address depths of character and truths of life has grown with each book and showcased in Allegiant.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it this game is so addicting I think it's the new age crack  I never thought I'll be addicted to anything much less than a game
B0036S4B6M|3.0|I enjoyed the way Kerman took the time to be introspective about her stay in prison.  She tells it with intelligent and compassionate narrative.
006202406X|5.0|I know everybody is damn about the final but I think is the best way to end this book. The important lesson that Veronica shows us in this book is to be brave no matter what happens, and also as we know the most importante lesson is this: \\"We believe in ordinary acts of bravery, in the courage that drives one person to stand up for another.\\"<br />and in this book at the final I think this lesson is so important. I have to say this Veronica you really show me how to be brave, how to be free about my own fears, how to be intelligent or how to be and stiff (joke. Everyone in this world is divergent so the best think that we can do respect to this book is to take the messade that it gives to us and show to Veronica that we are free and we are brave. Really thanks Veronica<br />Monica Jiménez Montes de Oca<br />Mexico<br />Dauntless, abnegated and erudite.<br />thanks for all Veronica really<br />Be brave Veronica
630587493X|5.0|I have always been in love with this movie and to be able to find it new and in its original wrapper and we'll priced was very nice.
B009V0TV6O|5.0|I did not get the free version, but one with many many variations. Even some that would encourage children, perhaps by replacing the standard metronome with a heart. Very clever.
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|This book, for the most part, kept me interested and reading. It would have been so much better had I liked the author. From her phony last name, to her lack of empathy for anyone but herself, her lack of morals as evidenced by her cheating on the man she purported to love, her heroin usage, and her being so ill-prepared for a hiking trip of this duration, I just could not identify with her or appreciate her angst. I realize the loss of her mother was a major event in her life, but it could not excuse, for me, her flawed personality.  There was just nothing admirable about her.<br /><br />I was more interested in the descriptions of the trail, of which there were not enough.  And why ever did this book take so long to write?  Is this story really accurate or real? And just how did this hiking trip transform her into a better human being?  I saw no epiphanies in her story. And for god sakes, why did she put that horse story in this book. If I had been involved in such an incident, I would never have related it to anyone, even my confessor, if I was religious.<br /><br />Cheryl is not all bad, IMHO.  She is a decent writer. Her book has been pretty darn successful. She is just not an inspiration to me.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Terrific read, loved the connection between the 91 yr. old and the young juvie. Some much insight into the happenings of all the<br />Orphans. I now want to read the true story about the Orphan Trains. Thanks for such a great book.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|Moderately Interesting  but kind of borrowed plots from other books. Plots were rather predictable. It started out great but went to, kind of like other books I have read.
B001BANK32|5.0|Four and a half stars.  Not quite five, but a &#34;very well done&#34; nevertheless.  There are some differences between movie and book of course in distinct ways.  The book is over 450 pages and so there is some stuff left out in the movie version but the basic story lines are followed quite closely.  As I recall, there was nowhere near the detail of Jack's life pre Overlook that the book covers, particularly his drinking forays with rich guy Al.  The most significant differences seem to be in the ending.  Jack's demise is very different in the book, a lot more fitting.  And the fortunes of Dick Halloran are also markedly different (thank goodness).  I suppose what attracted me to the book at this stage was the recent release of Doctor Sleep.  I enjoyed &#34;The Shining&#34; book very much but won't likely read the follow-up.  I think I've had enough.  (And for those dying to know....there is no &#34;Here's Johnny&#34; in the book - why do I think that's strictly a Jack Nicholson creation???).  One great attraction of the movie - that I had forgotten - was the great scenery in the opening credits; not Colorado by the way.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The Shining was one of the scariest books I have ever read, loved it. The follow up, which was unexpected but could not wait to get into once I found it, continued with one of his best characters. Great follow up. I did not want to put it down.  King is a genius.
B003O86FMW|5.0|:) in thy uhh uhh uhh though using is web in on a Inc arch Lisa is ps3 kHz if
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|When this movie first came out I remember thinking how fun and creative it was to reimagine Peter Pan as a grownup. Now watching it as a grownup (physical age, not mentality), it is amazing to see how well the movie holds up, the star studded cast, and what I consider to be one of Robin Williams most entertaining performances.
B00G32MPWU|2.0|Waste of time, a waste of my money and a waste of my education writing anything more than what I have.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Just wanted something to sharpen my pocket knife, not knowing anything about sharpening and this is very easy and straight forward. Gave me a good edge.
B005HED63W|1.0|I LOVED star trek as a kid and I was really looking forward to enjoying the nostalgia of re-watching some of my favorite episodes. Unfortunately they were completely ruined by some genius that decided to try to &#34;fix&#34; the special effects. 90% of the charm of watching these shows is to see them as I saw them years ago, crappy special effects and all. Why would someone think that  replacing the bad (but charming) special effects of the 1960's with the slightly more sophisticated but utterly annoying, intrusive, and out-of-place effects of a second-rate 1990's CGI shop would improve these classic episodes is beyond comprehension. Every time one of these infuriatingly distracting effects shots would come on screen it was like getting punched in the gut. I had to stop watching. Whoever bastardized these classics with that disgusting CGI garbage committed the highest form of sacrilege. May the sci-fi gods have no mercy on your soul. Damn you a thousand times over. You have ruined Star Trek!!!
0143124544|4.0|It was such a great story to the very end.  It grabs you and you can't put it down. A love story.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really loved the fact that I no longer have to sit in front of my computer to play this game.  I only thing different that I have noticed so far is that some of the challenges at the different levels are not the same as on the PC version but most are.  Thanks for finally making it available for Kindle Fire.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|Very well written. Although not compleatley historically accurate. It is still one of my favorite shows to watch on amazon.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I was just think a few days back that most of the books I have been reading have all had happy endings well sadly this one doesn't, and I loved it is so well written as the other 2 are. it is sad this book series has come to the end but it is a great short series. I can't wait to see the movie of the first book when comes out next year of Divergent. :)yes, towards the make sure you have tissues.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I really love Ever Notes and its User Friendliness. While it is very powerful, it is also very easy to use and enhance. Thank you so much for creating it. P.S. I also love the fact that I can have my work on every device I own what a gift and a joy.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|There are not many games that are so beautiful and addicting as this one! I couldn't stop playing! Esp for the price!
0385523394|5.0|I can understand why this book is a best seller. Especially since it's the authors own story.  It's fast reading and the author explains how women survive in prison from day to day - month to month. I am certainly not a &#34;book critic&#34; so I will leave it with these last few words.  This book makes you actually feel what Kerman is explaining, it also made me laugh, and cry. Also, I was left feeling unsettled with how our justice system works in various circumstances. Read the book, you won't be able to put it down and judge for yourself.
006202406X|5.0|I thought the ending was beautiful and had a lot of great thoughts about grief. As someone who has experienced grief I could really relate to the book.
1401238580|5.0|I always wanted to get both items, the mask and the novel. This is the perfect option for doing so
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love it! It keep your mind active all the time which I think it's excellent! So I would recommend this game to everyone I know!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|try to think outside the box I got rarity rainbow dash and everyone else with out spending a dime in just one sitting think about it you will find the solution
B005NQ94KS|5.0|I saw this film on cable and it was compelling enough for me to purchase it on DVD.  The character of Emma Moriarity, a mousy young aspiring writer, played by Miss Anne Hathaway was so compelling that I am writing this review as a tribute to her portrayal.  Dexter, as her man-child friend and love interest, shows character development as he grows and matures during the unfolding story.  I would call it a kind of sad love story, depicting how tentative life can be, which got me into trouble with my woman whom this film affected so strongly because my chrome plated heart was more inured than hers to the charms of this movie.  Watch it with someone you love a lot.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|This film had us laughing from the git-go.Great family fun. Well, done, visually and with excellent casting. Characters are true, Very funny
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I travel a lot and this app is great for my Kindle.  I like all the features and the ability to use my own music for an alarm.
B00EF1PKJQ|5.0|I know very few about Sarah,<br />Just know it's 5 stars.<br />After listen to the album,<br />I was deeply in love with her great voices.<br />She indeed a great singer.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I do prefer book five over book four mainly because the characters that I most care about are in this book. I understand why Martin split the books they way he did. I found that reading this book while listening to the audio book really helped me pick up more details in the story that I may have missed. Great book.
006202406X|1.0|I'm so upset. Not because of the ending, which a lot of people are annoyed about, but because I honestly found this book boring.<br />With Divergent and Insurgent, I read them in a day each. I couldn't put them down, and I was desperate for this final book to find out what was going to happen next. I rated Divergent 5*s and Insurgent 4*s. Allegiant is disappointing. It's poorly written, boring, and a major contrast to the first two. The divergent series has been my favourite for a long time, but now it's dropped to a very low place. How sad.
0141394811|5.0|Only 50+ pages into the book but already fascinated with the poetic cadence of Morrissey's writing style. Stories of a bleak childhood and the burgeoning of the artist as a young man. A bit self-indulgent but isn't that what Morrissey is all about?
B00FEN000S|5.0|Loved the way it was put together, how the story came about, and how the characters connected. Plus Charlie Hunnam enough said
B003B02O0A|4.0|A heart wrenching description of a terrible and despicable crime followed by trials and tribulations of the legal defence of the father who takes the law into his own hands.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Love this series. Great TV. this is one of the best things on TV today. I hope this series doesn't end anytime soon.
B00CBLQCO4|4.0|Difficult to get started as it is both slow to develop and somewhat complicated, but gets better as it goes along.
B0068THAGY|4.0|Was very impressed with the story and the kids acting.  It was a great movie and can't wait to watch it again!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A great way to make time go by great playability very addictive. I tried not to conform but soo glad I did.
B00D41H2PS|5.0|I really liked this game, Lots of fun puzzles at about the right difficulty, nice graphics and no hidden objects. Puzzle games are hard to find in the morass of the boring HO genre and I would really like to see more.  The only problem I had was with a tiny cigarette lighter that I needed to start a fire in the fireplace.  It was really small on my Kindle Fire and I had to consult the walk-through to find it.  Nevertheless, it was a great game.
B00008G7UJ|5.0|I have always lived Romeo and Juliet, so when it was listed for $1 I had to order it. It was in great condition and came sooner than the estimated delivery date. I'm very happy with this purchase.
1938469011|5.0|Just like the \\"Yeast\\" book before it this book could practically be a stand alone textbook for self-taught brewers.  Everything most brewers would ever need to know about hops is included in an easy to read format and this (as well as the rest of the \\"Brewing Elements\\" series) sit front and center on my brewing bookshelf.

B00004YYDI|5.0|I can not believe that it took me 20 years to finally see this movie absolutely excellent. Great acting the start of 3 great acting career's.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A gripping novel which was tough to put down. I'm looking forward to reading the other two books. Plenty of twists and turns which keep you on the edge of your seat. Don't try to figure out what's next..... You'll be wrong.
1591840562|4.0|Below are key excerpts from the book that I found particularly insightful:<br /><br />1- &#34;Great companies. Great divisions. Great schools. Great churches. Great not-for-profits. When it comes to the fundamentals of starting up, they are more alike than they are different. The key to their success is to survive the microscope tasks while bringing the future closer.&#34;<br /><br />2- &#34;GIST (GREAT IDEAS FOR STARTING THINGS): 1. MAKE MEANING 2. MAKE MANTRA. 3. GET GOING. 4. DEFINE YOUR BUSINESS MODEL. No 5. WEAVE A MAT (MILESTONES, ASSUMPTIONS, AND TASKS).&#34;<br /><br />3- &#34;THE ART OF INTERNAL ENTREPRENEURING: PUT THE COMPANY FIRST...KILL THE CASH COWS...STAY UNDER THE RADAR...FIND A GODFATHER...GET A SEPARATE BUILDING...GIVE HOPE TO THE HOPEFUL...ANTICIPATE, THEN JUMP ON, TECTONIC SHIFTS...BUILD ON WHAT EXISTS...COLLECT AND SHARE DATA...LET THE VICE PRESIDENTS COME TO YOU...DISMANTLE WHEN DONE...REBOOT YOUR BRAIN.&#34;<br /><br />4- &#34;SEIZE THE HIGH GROUND Unless you are a rabbit about to be devoured by a coyote, good positioning is inspiring and energizing. It does not allow itself to • get mucked up in money, market share, and management egos. These i are the qualities to aspire to: POSITIVE...CUSTOMER-CENTRIC...EMPOWERING...In addition to seizing the high ground, good positioning is a workhorse. It is practical and serves tactical and strategic purposes that are easily understood and believed by customers, vendors, employees, journalists, and partners. Thus, good positioning also embodies these qualities: SELF-EXPLANATORY...SPECIFIC...CORE...RELEVANT...LONG-LASTING...DIFFERENTIATED.&#34;<br /><br />5- &#34;Many entrepreneurs try to perfect their business plan and then pull PowerPoint slides out of it. They view the business plan as ; the be-all and end-all, and the pitch as a subset of this magnificent document. This is backward thinking. A good business plan is a a detailed version of a pitch—as opposed to a pitch being a distilled version of a business plan. If you get the pitch right, you'll get the plan right.&#34;<br /><br />6- &#34;You can argue as much as you like about the precise number of calls bottom-up model yields a much more realistic forecast than even the most pessimistic market share estimates of a consultant's forecast about the total size of a market. The magnitude of your bottom-up forecast will establish the degree of bootstrapping you'll have to do. The only information that will point out the need for bootstrapping more accurately is looking at your bank account balance. &#34;<br /><br />7- &#34;If you do take this path, however, understand that starting as a service business is a good initial path but isn't always the right long-term strategy. Getting customers to pay for your research and development should be only a temporary strategy for a product-based company. In the long run, a service business is fundamentally different from a product business. The former is all about slave labor and billable hours or projects. The latter is all about research and development, shipping, and spreading costs over thousands of boxes going out the door.&#34;<br /><br />8- &#34;Good recruiting starts at the top: CEOs must recruit the best people they can find. Next, good recruiting requires looking beyond superficialities such as race, creed, color, education, and work experience. Instead, you should focus on three factors: 1. Can the candidate do what you need: 2. Does the candidate believe in the meaning you're going to make? 3. Does the candidate have the strengths you need (as opposed to lacking the weaknesses you're trying to avoid)?&#34;<br /><br />9- &#34;PREPARE A STRUCTURE FOR THE INTERVIEW BEFOREHAND...ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT SPECIFIC JOB SITUATIONS...STICK TO THE SCRIPT...DON'T OVERDO OPEN-ENDED, TOUCHY-FEELY QUESTIONS...TAKE COPIOUS NOTES...CHECK REFERENCES EARLY.&#34;<br /><br />10- &#34;Never assume you're done. Recruiting doesn't stop when a candidate accepts your offer, nor when he resigns from his current employer, nor on his last day at his current employer—not even after le starts at your organization. In actuality, recruiting never stops. Every day is a new contract between a startup and an employee.&#34;<br /><br />11- &#34;What most organizations learned is that partnerships are hard to make work. Though both parties wanted 2 + 2 to equal 5, they ended up with 3 instead. The problem is that glamour, flattery, and potential press coverage often seduced organizations into entering nonsensical collaborations. The gist of good partnering is that it should accelerate cash flow, increase revenue, and reduce costs. Partnerships built on solid business principles like these have a much greater likelihood of succeeding. Once you understand this, a partnership is simply a matter of implementation: making sure the people who do the real work buy into it, finding internal champions, focusing on strengths, cutting win-win deals, waiting for the right moment to bring in lawyers and legal documents, and establishing ways to end the relationship.&#34;<br /><br />12- &#34;World-class schmoozers adopt Rezac's outward, what-can-I-do-for-you attitude. It is the key to building extensive, long-lasting connections. Upon this foundation, here's how to get more people to know you:  GET OUT...ASK GOOD QUESTIONS, THEN SHUT UP...FOLLOW UP.&#34;signs from his current employer, nor on his last day at his current employer—not even after le starts at your organization.

B005544TRQ|5.0|This series is fun to watch but it is a little predictable. The Lewis character is fun to watch getting burned.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It a great mind game make u think that what u need if u going to play à game. B
B00A8ECU24|5.0|cool game I love my little pony it is so me I watched all the seasons on netflix yay you will like the game
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game I can never get tired of this I will be on the game for a hour or two
B001TH16DI|5.0|Five Stars, of course. Would have given more if available! Though I love all things Trek, the original cast will always have a special place.
B000UR9QHQ|5.0|I'm really glad I picked this up on blu ray. The movie looks fantastic, especially for a film made in 1978. The movie is a classic. The price is great, if your considering purchasing this blu ray version you won't be disappointed.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|...captivating the reader with tidbits of every kind from one of the most remarkable years in the long history of this country, all told by one of today's best writers.  At once funny, illuminating, maddening, and altogether interesting, a story told with the ease and charm for which Bill Bryson is well-known.  This book reminds us anew why we as readers wait with baited breath for each new gem that flows from his fertile mind and capable hand.  The reader won't be able to it down, but what else is new?
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Thumbs up.....it's a great app and I would recommend this to anyone....just kidding  I haven't even used it I just want the free theme thing! ,:D
B009V0TV6O|4.0|Overall this is a pretty nice metronome. Very customizable as far as rhythm goes; it is good for new and experienced musicians.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Customizable Rythms<br />+ Few Permissions<br />+ Takes Up Little Storage Space<br />+ No Advertisements<br />+ Stereo Sound Clips<br />+ Customizable Animation and Sound<br />+ Can Run in the Background<br />+ Cuts Off If a Phone Call Comes In<br />+ FAOTD<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Rough UI<br />- Hard to Find/Access Settings<br />- For Some the Free Version Loads Initially<br /><br />Help: For those who had the issue of the free version loading instead of the paid version, delete the app and redownload it. If this still doesn't work, contact Amazon Customer Support.<br /><br />Bottom Line: This app is a pretty nice metronome, one of the best I've used (especially because of the stereo sound clips). Musicians, especially if your current virtual metronome is a free version, give this app a try. A great FAOTD, though I am not sure if I would pay $1.99 for it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is great for showing kids what needs to be done if you own a horse. My grandchildren love playing and so do I.
B004JHYRAE|3.0|This book is from a couple of 60's love children, not that there's anything wrong with that, but you'll see it painted through out the book. This is not a manual. But in my opinion, is a good book for reflection and thought.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I can not stop playing it it's so fun! So definitely get this you won't regret it. Plus it all about Despicable me minions who doesn't like those guy.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I knew the ending going in, and I told my fellow Allegiant readers that I was OK with it (even though I knew it would hurt) if it was authentic and served the story. It did NOT and here's why...  ~Unbelievably ridiculous plot holes ~Four would NEVER believe that Tris would willingly watch someone she loves sacrifice himself. He knows her better than that. We've seen it repeatedly. It's what made her so brave and selfless--her inability to stand by while others suffer--this played out over and over again.  This entire book was riddled with plot holes. It was monotonous. It was repetitive. It was ridiculous. Laughably so. The explanations to the WONDERFUL story set up by Roth in Divergent consistently fell flat and felt contrived. Not good fiction. Not an ounce. Four acted out of character. Tris acted out of character. I could go on.  Can you tell I'm not even upset by the ending? I'm upset about everything that led to it. Tris, in the end, acted completely in character. It was everything that led to that that was a mess. And leaving us with a shell of Four? Ridiculous. At least give us some hope for him.  The cure? Reread Divergent. Watch them be themselves. Watch them ride off into the sunset together. And let that be the end of their story because what unravelled after that held NO justice for these characters or their original story.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Awesome game get it now. It's so amazing and entertaining!! Some questions are hard but it is all worth it.
B005H0CBZ0|3.0|From outlander .. the series is set to become outlandish ... I think I shall stop now when the going is good.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A Time To Kill was always my favorite Grisham novel...until now. Sycamore Row is a must-read; a griping story that takes you back to Ford County, pulls you in and captivates the reader.  A true page-turner that will leave the reader shaken yet renewed.  Well done, Mr. Grisham. Well done.
B00821OX98|4.0|The only thing that kept me from applying the 5th star was the fact that the series started really slowly. I only continued to watch the second and third show because of some of the other reviews that I read. In the end, I was glad I did.
B0097GVJWQ|3.0|I would have easily given this game 5 stars. The storyline was interesting, the puzzles were very good and the mini games challenging enough. When I got close to the end . And was trying to solve the runes puzzle. I spent a lot of time trying to do so, nothing seemed to work. I finally went to their website and checked both the forum and the walkthru. I www as doing everything right based on what I read. However, I also noticed that many people were experiencing the same problems I was. A lot of people, using different platforms, thought this to be a bug. I agree. I would like to see a reply from tech support addressing this issue. I would like to finish the game. A shame to an otherwise excellent game.
B007QPFGJW|4.0|In reading murder mysteries over the past several years, I usually use John Grisham as the &#34;Gold Standard&#34; because of his making the characters come alive and also the way he makes the stories flow. I have not really enjoyed the mass output of some of our American authors as they churn out the books like a Detroit assembly line and they all become more or less alike in many ways.  In the &#34;Phantom&#34;. I found a little different slant because of the approach by the Sandinavian writers. The Swedish trilogy of several years was terrific....  In the Phantom, although I liked it, it was a book that left me with mixed feelings.  The author has written other books which I also enjoyed..  Now I am reading a murder mystery written by a Danish author which is also likable.  So for readers who like murder mysteries, I would recommend it .(Phantom)
B006LSZECO|5.0|Yay!  Great book!  Recommended read to readers looking for a suspense novel. Author keeps you on your toes the entire time.
B000002KE2|5.0|My brother had this album on vinyl when I was 7 years old. Nobody played metal music like this in 1973. As the heavy metal craze of the early 80s took off, metal artists used Black Sabbath as their reference.<br /><br />I see the original band members put together a new release. You can tell the refinement in their playing style in the 41 years that elapsed between the new and this album.
B004JMY312|5.0|Great  movie for the family! My children  and I watch it every year . It is out Halloween tradition .
B00BD99JMW|2.0|What a terrible way to end an excellent series.<br />The duel points of view didn't work at all; Tobias didn't have his own voice.  I had to keep pausing to remind myself who was narrating the chapter.  The ending was predictable.  Had you told me after book one about the conclusion, I would have assumed that I would cry or feel some type of emotion.  But, there was nothing.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|When I was a high school senior I hung with a few junkies and as soon as I heard Royals I said this would have been a favorite of those friends.I'm sure of it now.
B005HEPS6A|5.0|All the seasons for free with Prime? A Trekkie's dream come true! Season 3 is as amazing as the other 6 seasons!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This series was so so good...until this book. The ending was so disappointing!!! (Sorry for the spoiler, but save yourself the heartache) you never kill the main character!!! We read books to get away from real life, not to feel like we are reading about our real lives.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|This was a most enjoyable family movie. With so many bombs out there of late, we didn't opt to see this one in the theater. What a mistake! It was great.
0307948110|2.0|Taken by the catchy title and fanciful synopsis, I bought this book with plenty of excitement. But it turned out differently.<br /><br />The book central character was a PHD physics scientist who used to work in Switzerland CERN research. Once there, he moved from being a hardware to software specialist. Because of his interest in data collection and analyst (esp in processing of bulk data), he moved to the field of finance.<br /><br />Following this central character was a non-thrilling experience for the readers. If the author's idea was to create the least endearing 2 dimensional scientist character (whose only good in system design) without social and humane skills, he had done a good job.<br /><br />Even for a serial killer character like Hannibal, he was known to be charming. As a chameleon, he used his smartness to be likeable to his environments, masking his personal agendas. For this book, the author liked quoted Darwin extensively. Surely the basic trait in Darwinism was that, humans were primarily social animals.<br /><br />Thus it made me wondered, how can this book's character reputed to be so smart and yet be so impulsively dumb at times in social graces and with rages always constantly waiting to surface.<br /><br />This reader sort of expected the overwhelming intelligence of the lead character to moderate his dumb behavior. But there was no intention to mask them at all. I found that as fairly incompatible traits. Ultimately the central character was not about a tormented hero or someone smart but with character flaws. This lead character was basically as boring as a number cruncher machine (i.e. calculator).  As a reader, I struggled to like or find excitement in following the lead character in his journey.<br /><br />Moving on to the plot. I would not divulge the final plot here. But it started to make sense only on the 3/4 mark of the book. Before that, readers were left clueless about what the story might be, unless you were smart enough to guess it. At the same time, the book did not build up any suspense for the readers to salivate, while taking them to this only and final plot.<br /><br />I initially guessed that the book could borrowed a page like the movie \\"The Game\\" (by Michael Douglas), where a rich person was being played around, likely by someone or a syndicate. But there was not the case.<br /><br />For all the troubles the lead character encountered, readers were led to wonder if he was having a mental breakdown again, leading him to have a siege mentality or he was suffering from dementia, therefore having memory lapse or he was simply being attacked by some past enemies whose identify he had not figured out.<br /><br />The book then touched on the vision of complete AI working in the field of behavioral finance. The computer was supposed to interpret and successfully trade the market based on the trend of VIX (i.e. stock market fear index) and news events. It tried to present to readers that the improvements in computer speed and logics interpretation could make computer smart and such a feat. But this remained a big fantasy as computer remained a machine with no self intelligent or awareness.<br /><br />So for a context modern day fiction, the presentation on the AI capability was over exaggerated. Even if this was a science fiction, a science fiction author would have taken the trouble to present some plausible means to achieve complete AI to convince the readers. For this book, the readers got to trust the lead character's smartness in developing such a capable machine. I found that pretty shallow.<br /><br />To sidetrack, the author seemed to have a thing against the city of Geneva. The book portrayed the city as where people combined with enormous greed, pretentious behavior and longing for privacy were welcomed.<br /><br />In summary, there ware no magnetic lead character, no building up of suspense and no novel idea to wow the readers. I got the feeling the author wrote the book for thesake of writing, and his good writing style made the book readable. Also credit to be given that the book had a good marketing/packaging campaign to make it looked attractive. Overall I felt that it was still a nice read to pass time and relax. I gave it a high 2 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />(Readers might get more of AI and its possibility on humans by reading this 2 pages article.<br /><br />[...]
0143038419|1.0|After all the hype about this book, I expected a quality read.  Instead it read like a self absorbed monologue.  This was a huge disappointment.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad they finally got this game on Kindle!  Woot Woot  Been waiting a long time for it to arrive.  So much easier to play on the Kindle then the cell phone 8=)
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|One of my daughters and I tried these exercises together and they really worked. One of them took 7 hours more than the 48 hours. I was so impressed I purchased this book for one of my other daughters and two of my friends.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This series is moving. Like deep in your soul moving. I read every book in a matter of days. I couldn't get enough. The characters are so real. They embody who we all are inside. This book teaches about humanity in a way I thought only experience could. Maybe it's my experiences that let me see it shine through this narrative. Challenging themes, love, sacrifice, hatred, forgiveness, loss, it's ALL there and beautifully done. I feel better for having read this series.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is the new crack. It has taken over my life. Even the music is stuck in my head.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|The storyline, graphics and sound effects are amazing. I am overly pleased despite the price for the game app. If you are considering paying the price for a good game app then this game might be just for you.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I am really glad I got it &amp; enjoy using it. The glow at night does not bother me at all.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|World War II is seen from the perspective of families in eapitals of the involved adversaries. This gives a more personal view than just the historical facts.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Wish you didn't have to wait for lives or pay but love it very much and even my kids love it.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I was with her until that awful moment that changed everything. I couldn't believe that what I was reading was true, because that would mean that Veronica Roth, despite her huge success, gave up and took the easy way out at her fans' expense. She did not give her characters the respect that they deserved in the end. It was so rushed, and honestly I didn't recognize them anymore by the time I read the last line. It felt like Roth was tired of them and finished the book as fast as she could at the expense of her readers.<br /><br />I feel like that ending ruined the entire series for me.  I don't plan to see the movies either. I waited over six months for this just to get jerked around and I feel very irritated.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I couldn't wait for this book to come out!  When it was finally realeased, I was disappointed. There didn't seem to be a plot. And where did these unnecessary characters come from?<br />First, I don't care about Corrine (she is a story filler). I also don't care about Carey. I enjoyed him in the first two books, but now, he can be written out. I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing.<br />I don't understand why there are going to be 2 MORE BOOKS! This story should have ended here. I'm guessing the author is now greedy. She took a fantastic \\"trilogy\\" and ruined it in order to keep the money rolling in
B00BAXFECK|1.0|I did not enjoy this book at all.  Of course my age may have something to do with that.  I am 87 and the whole plot left me cold.  It was much too long and boring.<br />When I saw that the author was from Mississippi, I was stunned.  I am from Mississippi and I could not believe that anyone from that state could dream up such a<br />narrative .  I'm sorry I wasted my money buying that book.  It certainly should not be the best selection for October.
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|I'm sorry, I screwed up by actually thinking while watching this movie. The trailer really made it look like it would be an awesome flick, as did the high customer ratings, but just minutes into the film, regret sunk in.<br /><br />First off, do you honestly believe the world's nations would enter a totally benevolent pact, without wanting anything to gain? Just building a single Jaeger would cost in the hundreds of billions, likely trillions, of dollars; knowing how shaky the global economy, how is all of this going to be paid for? Also, which contractor is going to build these monstrous robots, and how likely do you think it is that they will be completely honest in their initial cost estimates when making their pitch to win the contracts? It was also pretty ridiculous when the nations opted to discontinue funding the Jaeger program, so it became &#34;underground&#34;. Seriously, how the heck could this program survive if it's underground? They never explained where it is getting its funding.<br /><br />As for the Jaegers, why wouldn't they develop them to be controlled remotely, like drones? This would completely eliminate loss of life for the pilots and their likelihood of suffering an injury.<br /><br />And then, you have to consider the billions upon billions it would cost cities to rebuild after a cataclysmic attack from a Kaiju--where is that money coming from, and is Allstate also going to add &#34;Kaiju attack&#34; coverage to auto insurance plans? I would probably move to Texas because staying in California would be way too expensive for me.<br /><br />Another thing, the aliens--don't you think they should diversify with the arsenal? Being a Navy veteran myself, I know a thing or two about military preparation. They have the Kaijus, which proved to be highly effective in their initial assaults, but didn't the aliens learn anything after losing their first Kaiju to a Jaeger? Having giant weapons may be awfully intimidating, but you're sacrificing quite a bit of mobility. Also, how come the aliens didn't think to build more portals? Seriously.<br /><br />If you're into mind-numbing dialogue and giant robots fighting giant aliens, this movie is for you. But, if you're unfortunate enough to have developed critical and analytical thinking skills, it's going to be a LOOOOOOOOONG two hours.
B002M9WW30|3.0|Don't know how this particular set was remastered for blu ray but it looks pretty poor.  The 1st movie was grainy and looked at times that I was watching a VHS copy.  Haven't checked the others yet, but for the price ,( bought it on a daily deal) I'll keep it as it is good to have the entire collection. Just wish they had put more effort into the remastering process.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Anyone considering buying this set of DVDs already knows all about the Zombie Apocalypse and it's aftermath that is the heart of this exceptional television series from AMC. And he or she is already leaning toward purchase or they would not be reading this review. I make no attempt to tell the story to the uninitiated. Watch the first season episodes to see if you are &#34;into&#34; Walkers or not. What I will say that this series is one of the most intense and provocative on TV, and worth your consideration. Each season has gotten better and has drawn followers more deeply into the plight of all involved. This third season set is full of mind wrenching situations and problems that humans must somehow solve without losing their own humanity in the process....not all people we meet succeed in doing this...and some who were considered lost souls regain their humanity and dignity in surprising twists of plot. You followers of the series understand me...the rest of you....join us! You won't be disappointed...but you've been warned!<br /> Purchase from Amazon was totally satisfying, as usual. Packaging is top shelf. Service totally satisfying.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Perfect in every aspect. Great series. Great author. Couldn't have asked for a better series to read. And now that it's all over, I'll sit in thought for a week.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I'm a little over half done reading the book. Eventhough I've not completed the book, I think it's great! I have began to put some of the principles into practice and I can say that they do work. I would suggest it to anyone. The readings will cause one's way of thinking to totally change in a very positive way.
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|There's something about this version that I find captivating.  The acting is wonderfuly sublime.  Alexis and Amy are spot on for their roles.  It's funny where it should be and serious when it needs to be.  And the setting ...  relaxed, modern, classic.  Filmed in black and white, this was a joy to watch.  I cannot remember the last time I enjoyed a film so much.  Bravo!
B004ZH66XO|2.0|This is an action game where you swim around as a fish eating other fish to &#34;Grow&#34; bigger.  The bigger you are the more fish you can eat.  Each level increases with difficulty and it is reminiscent of Evo or Feeding Frenzy.  The game falls short on many levels with bland graphics, lame sound, repetitive game play, constant lag, huge memory usage, and massive battery drain.  I originally gave it one star, but bumped it up to 2 since they got rid of Ads and micro-transactions.  This game would be worth it if free, but I don't feel it delivers on even a dollars worth of entertainment.  Still, I rate it 2 stars and recommend it to age 5+ diehard fans of XBLA's feeding frenzy that are desperate for a portable version in it's simplest form.
B002CIY8EM|2.0|This guy is a nut case.  I was very interested in what he had to say but just got turned off because everything was just an assumption on his part.  Voodoo math, I would call it.  Check out many of the places he talked about to see what newer researchers had to say and his assumptions just weren't even accurate.  I wanted to believe what he had to say because I do believe in aliens and their probable visit to this planet but just couldn't based on what he had to say.
B003VANOFY|5.0|they are great<br />love em<br />iwould recomend them to friends and gamers<br />you should buy em they are absolutly awsome
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Clean Master is wonderful and cleans up all junk that builds up on any electronic devices. It is a must have for your Kindle.  Please don't waste another minute.
B00902S0IS|5.0|Movie was great in that it held a suspenseful captivating experience throughout itself. The movie kept ones attention at all times making you wonder what was going to happen next.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I've had evernote for less than a week and I absolutely love it. It is the note app I needed and it syncs wonderfully to my phone and laptop.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|Awesomely awful. Difficult to sit through the bad acting .  Wasn't quite a superhero movie and wasn't quite an action movie.
