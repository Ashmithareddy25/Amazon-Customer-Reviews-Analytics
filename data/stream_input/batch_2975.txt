0425263908|4.0|After reading the Fifty Shades series, I was looking for another series to read.  The Cross Fire Novel more than filled the void of Christian and Anna!  Eva and Gideon are great characters and the story line is wonderful. Not to mention the steamy encounters between Eva and Gideon. I could not put the books down!  I cannot wait for the fourth book in the series!  I have started to read Bared to You for the second time.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It was a good game I would recommend getting it. It was not to hard to learn so Yahoo pretty good.
B002NXSRVG|5.0|I have watched this movie at least 5 times and I continue to want to watch it again. That is the reason as to why I purchased this movie.
B00DW39B2K|3.0|I love both these guys and Travolta never fails to amaze me. What a flexible guy. Even if it were horrible I'd be compelled to watch it if only because these two are in it. Short review. It's not what you think. You've seen something similar . It had more potential.
B00CATONCA|5.0|wonderful, a must in any collection of movies or series, a good price and good product worth buying. thanks :)
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Exactly what came with the kindle fire originally only in black. Charges my cell phone too. Good to have a backup.
B0013ND30M|5.0|movie was priced very well.  could not believe the deal that I got.  it was in excellent condition and shipped very fast and in a safe container to ensure no damage.  love this movie and it never gets old.  thank you
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey.  What can I say?  Love this series and can't wait for Season 4.  And yes, I will be ordering it on Amazon.  Good purchase.
B0013QRKMQ|1.0|Not the shippers fault but these Criterion Laserdiscs have not survived the last 20 years very well.  This disc and others I have purchased have a huge problem with Video Rot.  Dropouts, Freezes, Non-Playability.  Better to stick with DVD at this point.
B000XSEPYQ|1.0|I believe in storytelling that empowers people. Poking deeply inside human cruelty and suspense alone is not enough for me to rate this movie highly.
B008Y212PI|5.0|It's fun to see if you can do each one without mistakes.  Some are VERY easy, others are challenging, but not to the point of frustration.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I loved this book, I got all the other from the series and it ended great.<br />Even the 'Shadow' series is really good.
B00A3VLJCE|5.0|I love Photoshop touch. It is so awsome! Now i have Adobe Photoshop CS2 on my computer so i can also edit on the computer as well.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I got this game on a free day. It is a good time killer. I would recommend the game to anyone.
B00DVKZBP0|5.0|My daughter's favorite movie. Absolutely love it!! Very insightful and handles mental illness in a new but delicate way. Worth the $.
B006DJ2JSI|1.0|I'm angry, because of this:<br /><br />I have copies of a couple of standard dictionaries in .mobi or \\" book\\" form -- and it takes forever to search those damnable things -- .mobi \\"dictionaries\\" don't seem to have a \\"search\\" feature!<br /><br />So, I downloaded this, hoping that it would be better.  It had a \\"search\\" feature, right?  Well, it refuses to do its work, and took forever to load.<br /><br />This thing is damnable due to its revolting waste of time.  I don't care that it's free -- wasting my time like that is an unforgivable offense!<br /><br />I took it off of my tablet -- and am hoping to eventually find a way to remove it from my kindle history outright!<br /><br />One star -- but if I had my way, it would get only some minus-something or negative number!
0385523394|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I will say that if you think it follows exactly the TV series you are wrong.  The book is always better.  The TV show is written to give more drama.
B00E3I3KDE|5.0|Fantastic album, she's got something that no one else does, keep up the good work  Ellie o look forward to many more albums
0770437400|5.0|This book is a very fast read.  It was written as a post war prospective which I loved.  What I will say is this book makes the film look awful.
B0086449YA|4.0|Guess I don't much care for the &#34;funk&#34; tunes - I didn't care for &#34;You Can't Beat the House&#34; on Get Lucky either.
B009NH6AOQ|4.0|This is a little bit slower then the first two series.  It is mixing things up a bit from he comic books which keeps both interesting.  I enjoy this series.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love this game.  It's a lot like the one on the regular computer.  Your kids will love it.  I don't want to review any more products because I don't think I should have a word quota to say thumbs up or down
B00915G6WQ|3.0|the ending was as many others have said just not good.  I could see so may other endings that would have been better or more thought out.  I was in the end left disappointed.  I did as a whole enjoy this dark series.
B002LC8HF0|4.0|Beside logical magic systems and nice plot twists and turns, I really like character development in the Final Empire series. Particularly Elend Venture, whom I didn't like much in the first book, to interesting character in the second, and my personalfavorite in The Heor of Ages.<br /><br />The ending is also quite dramatic and satisfying.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Controversial topic but written neatly. The dialogues are witty. Not sure if this novel will give young girls an unrealistic idea about romance though.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|Really good movie with more to come I hope cause that ending was awesome really love the actors in this movie
B00BMQDM10|2.0|Not half as funny and sharp as the Shopaholic series and due to the topic no brand/fashion education to be had.
B005OK722U|4.0|'Say Die Strom (is that what he says,,,?)'.... 'The House Always Wins...'... 'Whaddya' say we finish that bachelor party?'... 'OMG Please don't...' Folks, the reason why I give this flick such high marks is because it covers all the 'basic grounds' of what a 'scary movie' should have, while at the same time it is believable, credible, like you could know these people as if they were your next door neighbor or something. The script is believable, the acting is commendable and to me, this is one of the scariest horror movies to emerge in quite some time (watch it the 1st time with the lights on, among trusted friends...).<br />  One thing I would like to say, in defense of horror movies: Don't judge people who like this type of thing, please don't play God or Jesus with us. Hey, I sat through Jason Vorhees, Michael Myers, Freddy Crougar and many other imaginative dark characters, all while going to church and singing in the Catholic choir. Some horror movie fans DO know the difference between right and wrong; and for those of you hellbent on judging us, you might be surprised to learn that movies like 'Hostel III' keep us staying good, as opposed to what you might think. Please - there are plenty of good-hearted souls who enjoy a good scary movie here and there, so if you want to be frightened, (and remember that evil does exist in our world), I highly recommend this movie. This is one of the scariest movies I've seen in quite some time; and after seeing it, if anything, it only strengthens my belief in Jesus, in the Afterlife, in spirit guides, in the wonderful world that awaits most of us who pass successfully into the Other World after our Physical Life has ended.<br />  Good job to all the actors, actresses, casting directors, filming directors, makeup artists, producers, etc... great movie.<br />  The house always wins...
B000YAA68C|5.0|Love this movie! Great story about love, sorrow and new beginnings. Amazon also provided a free download of the movie for my Kindle. Wow!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|As usual, Gaiman paints the most wonderful pictures with words.<br />A simple but impressive tale that makes me long for his next work.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|The movie was good, the storyline and character development solid. The only criticism was the music score/soundtrack didn't reflect the time period. Perhaps it was an attempt for a larger market share for those too lazy to read a literary classic.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|captivating story line...great character development...can't wait for the rest of the books in the series. Hurry up G R R Martin!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Our children are 14, 11, 8  and 6 and we all laugh as whenever we watch this movie as a family.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was diagnosed with stage IV cancer a little over a year ago and I both love and hate my brother for recommending this book to me. I hate him because it hit so close to home very accurately and I love him for recommending it for exactly the same reason. It gave me a kind of peace as I cried my way thru it.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|If you enjoyed the movie, you will love this soundtrack as it transports you back into the silver screen.  You'll sing along, you'll car-dance, and people may look at you like you are a total weirdo, but you will not regret owning this fun and energizing soundtrack.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app but I can't find out how to do multiplayer or realms. You should really get this app
B00594XOZU|1.0|Wont let me log in!!! Please fix whyyyyyy i must txt hopefully it will be fixed soon or im getting something else
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Could not put this down. Read all 5 books in less than a month. After the last book it was hard to get back to real life.  However, the maps are very hard to see on my original Kindle and the genealogy of each house would be better if the were in the same place as the maps.  Switching back and forth took time and was frustrating as I would often loose my place.  This is a wonderful set of books.  Can't believe this took me so long to discover them.  Back to reality and now I can watch the HBO versions.
B0006J28BO|5.0|GET IT!<br />its cute and interesting thats all I can say~<br />Plus I love films by Studio Ghibli and this is one of the best out of them all~
B005IQZB14|5.0|Great book!! So well written. Could hardly put it down. I wasn't expecting the heroin situation. But just seeing how she came through on the other side.
B004LH3AM8|5.0|I chose this book for a Government Issue class and absolutly loved it. Amy is so insightful and I actually see her as a great mother, and writer. Im hoping to read her other books and her children's book, tiger babies
B0084BMUFA|3.0|While reading this book, all I could hear was Michael Caine, every time scrooge spoke. It did make the book an interesting read.
B008B68IV8|5.0|My daughter loves this character, this is our first doll-monster, so favorite. I am satisfied with the purchase. doll very high quality. And we will buy other dolls.
B005ES1E4E|4.0|The overall comfort is as any croc great.  The heavy duty treed is nice.  The only issue I have is the price was about $15 high in my opinion.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|The book was absolutely amazing. Well written by Dashed and will be a favorite of mine for times to come.  YOU NEED TO KEEP THOMAS AROUND FOR SOME MORE CRAZY STUFF PLEASE!!!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|good app and it's free I don't know why I didn't have this app before. I love this battery app more everyday.
B00B52F278|5.0|It was a great series which it did not have to end. a lot of action great job loved the characters
B009LDD54K|5.0|Love this series. Have watched season 1 and 2 and totally enjoyed them. Can not wait for this season. Excited
B008Y212PI|4.0|I thought this app was fun! I got it when it was free so I can't confirm that it's worth the price, but I liked it!
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Love this series. The finale of season one was amazing. Can't wait to see this one. Claire Daines is exceptional.
1423136802|5.0|My girlfriend loved these books there's another series that continues their adventures. Good gift idea<br />I would buy again hopefully in another set
B008Y212PI|4.0|This is a very enjoyable game.  The only thing I dislike about it is that the completed picture looks nothing like the item it is supposed to represent.
B009O07NMA|5.0|Tracks 1,2,3,4,9 all amazing! All the others grow on you quickly great buy recommend to all who like FGL A+
0316227706|5.0|THIS BOOK WILL PUT A SMILE AND LIFT YOUR HEART IN THE SIMPLEST OF WAYS, WITH MAN'S BEST FRIEND! A GREAT BOOK
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I love the idea of people's lives changing unexpectedly and when the odds of meeting &#34;the one&#34; are so slim. The<br />casting in The Holiday was perfect - all of them excellent. Romance, humor, settings. It's got it all.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I didn't really want to read a story about Kabul, but liked the Kite runner.  This is another great story.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I found it<br />difficult to follow at times.
B0086449YA|5.0|Mark Knopfer delivers nicely on this album.  Good lyrics, good execution, great backup.  I recommend the album to Knopfler fans
0064431789|5.0|I love this book. I needed to purchase another one because I gave away my copy to a student who loved it too!
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|I had to get this movie after seeing RED 2. I think the second one was better but we definitely still enjoyed this one too,
159463176X|5.0|Khaled Hosseini writes some heart warming books, I got through this book less than 3 weeks, i couldn't stop reading it, it was as good as his other 2 books....
B005WUHAX8|5.0|LOVE this it is not only shock proof water proof and dust proof it's &#34;two year old&#34; proof! Love it!
1451695195|5.0|A very believable description of a near-death experience, written by a skilled doctor.  I enjoyed it.  I believe in the hereafter much more now.
B00BEZTMFY|1.0|Totally bummed by this movie.  I love all of the previous trilogy and still watch them over and over.  The Hobbit is so slow moving and uninspiring.  Fell asleep within the hour.  YMMV
B005LAII12|4.0|I loved it<br />not the best film ever. but its has some of the funniest lines ever.<br />HIghly Recommended<br /><br />If you have any questions feel free to contact me and ask.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|While I am not a big Downton Abbey watcher, my wife loves the show and you know that a happy wife means a happy family!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I couldn't put this book down from page one! I literally read it in less than 4hours.<br />Wonderful and powerful!
B00003CXAA|4.0|Well worth the money. This movie was ahead of its time, all three movies were. A classic indeed! Iwould buy again if I needed too.
B00006LLLN|5.0|If you like blue grass, or just great quality string music, I highly recommend this recording. While Union Station is legendary for their clean bluegrass sound, their ability to keep it this clean in a live performance is amazing! Of course, Alison Krauss' voice puts the icing on the cake, but key performances on steel string, guitar, banjo, and violin, make this an all around great experience.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fun game.  Easy to use and access.  This works well for me. Something special to keep my wife's mind occupied...
B008QZ1ZYQ|1.0|I really don't get this game??<br />I tried playing it for about 20 minutes before I finally gave up on it.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I liked it, it had a different spin on the classic tale, but it was a good &#34;rental&#34; movie. Probably wont watch again.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|I have a 9 year old and a 4 year old. It was a little scary for the 4 year old but we all love the way the movie told this classic tale.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|So disappointed there aren't more ...... I LOVED THESE BOOKS!!!!!  I couldn't stop after the first!!!!!!!!  Thank you, Stieg Larsson!!!
B00CBRH4YU|1.0|Truly one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.  Couldn't even get through it.  I'm a fan of Affleck but this one sucks.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Amazing little gadget. As of now you can only stream netflix and other online streaming sights. Can't wait till they let you stream local media from my movie library on my PC to the TV in the other room.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|Best band in a long time.  Loved their first album and this does not disappoint.  Went to their concert in Cleveland. Amazing
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|I wasn't sure what exactly to expect from this book given the title, but I must say; I couldn't put it down.  The characters and events are truly intriguing, inspiring and brings to light a level of awareness that most authors today can't seem to fathom.  After reading the book, I had to go back and read more about this wonderful author.  His life experiences are just as intriguing as his stories.  He is on a fast track to international stardom!  I love knowing that there are authors out there who seek to not only tell a great story, but also work to bring about the next level of global awareness that will definitly benefit us all!  Excellent work, Legg!
B00DIMXTBO|5.0|After starting the first in the trilogy, Outview; I couldn't put it down.  I had to continue the story.  I am more than pleased to announce that the second installment of the trilogy did not disappoint.  Picking up where the first left off, the story continued in true fashion, never breaking stride.  I love the introduction of new mystics and teachers.  Afterall, we all need a little help every now and then.  For Nate, the need was even greater.  I love that the main character never lost himself and who he truly was (a teenager in the \\"real\\" world), but that he was now much more wise thanks to his own hard work, self realization and the mystics and teachers ever so wise lessons of the unseen, unknown and overlooked realities of life.  I cannot wait for the third title, although, I will be greatly saddened to see it end.  I suppose all things must eventually come to a close to make way for something even better.  (Wait, is that possible for this author?  I sure hope so.  He has some mighty big shoes to fill even if they are his own!)
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I am totally addicted to this game! I love all of the different rooms and collecting things in each room. I also love the power ups and keys. Great game!
B004SIIBGU|3.0|It's a good app.  Easy to use. I found what I needed right away with almost no trouble at all.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|angry birds is definetly a super popular game and whoever doesn't like it is a total loser so there's a difference between angry bird haters opinions and mine is that mines just right...

0307592731|5.0|Talk about a Wild read.<br /><br />First off, yes, Cheryl Strayed was half-crazy to even conceive of making a solo hike across the Pacific Crest Trail, and she made lots of mistakes, before, during, and undoubtedly, after. She's lucky to be alive to write about some of the mistakes she made, and rather than taking this book as a how-to, much of it should be taken as a how-NOT-to.<br /><br />Don't be born into a household where your dad beats up your mom.<br />Don't live in poverty after your abused mom leaves your abusive dad.<br />Don't marry when you're too young to understand or make a long-term commitment to another person.<br />Don't let your mom die of cancer.<br />Don't drop out of college when you have only one more semester to go.<br />Don't sleep with endless men to try to fill the mom-shaped hole inside you.<br />Don't snort, smoke, or inject heroin.<br />Don't shoot your mom's horse because you don't have the money to pay a vet to euthanize it.<br />Don't depend solely on written material to prep for a two-month-plus solo expedition in the wilderness.<br />Don't go hiking in boots that don't allow room for your feet to swell.<br />Don't load a backpack too heavy for a sane person to carry.<br />Don't forget to watch for rattlesnakes.<br />Don't mispack the cash in your resupply boxes.<br /><br />But, if you HAVE done any/all of the above:<br /><br />Do love your mother deeply.<br />Do bond closely with your sister and brother.<br />Do everything you can to bring comfort to your dying mom, even when it's hard and her suffering is horrific.<br />Do read everything you can get your hands on.<br />Do make such a friend of your ex-spouse that you can call him and know he's still got your back.<br />Do get an absolutely awesome horse tattoo in honor of your mom.<br />Do make friends cool enough and reliable enough to mail your resupply boxes exactly when and where you need them.<br />Do name your outrageously heavy backpack \\"Monster.\\"<br />Do use all the sign-ins along the trail.<br />Do ALWAYS use your water filter and/or iodine tablets to prevent giardia and other icky waterborne diseases, no matter how thirsty you are.<br />Do shred and burn books to lighten your load.<br />Do peel off dead toenails as necessary.<br />Do pick up a ski pole or walking stick at the first opportunity.<br />Do keep a journal and take photos of your adventure.<br />Do by-pass the sections of the trail socked-in by snow when all the more experienced hikers are doing the exact same thing.<br />Do make friends and allies along the trail, and listen when they help you lighten your pack.<br />Do use condoms if/when you have spontaneous sex along the way.<br />Do trust your gut instincts and avoid skeevy people.<br />Do use your journey to help your head, heart, and life get into the right place.<br />Do write an account of your journey, and submit it for publication.<br />Do enjoy \\"overnight success.\\"<br /><br />I loved this book, and loved it more because Cheryl was NOT perfect, and didn't pretend to be.

B004I9CXHW|5.0|Good product and cheap. From every where I look does not beat the price. So I highly recommend the product.
B00CWZMUMC|5.0|Love this movie! Purchase came in great condition! Glad we made this purchase. will watch over and over. great purchase!
B003VANOFY|4.0|So I have had a long standing history with Logitech products and for the most part I have always loved them for their reliability and quality but these G930's are not what I had initially envisioned.<br />I had previously owned the wired version of this headset (G35's) and they worked perfectly. They provided the 7.1 surround sound you wanted and had solid consistency throughout its lifespan of 3 to 4 some odd years. It still works but the earpads have worn down to an almost unusable state which apparently was a common issue across many G35 users.<br />When I got the G930's I thought I would get the same experience but in a wireless form which for the most part is true. It works almost like the G35's but there are a couple of set backs that I have come by.<br /><br />1.) The first pair I got had an issue a week after I got them where after a couple hours of use it would randomly stop functioning and start screeching white noise into my ear. At first I thought it was a minor thing but over time it got more frequent and worse. Not to mention that as it was happening it would tell me the batteries were dead even though it said it was fully charged a second ago. So like any normal consumer I got them quickly replaced by the excellent customer support from Amazon.<br />2.) As I started using the second pair I noticed that there are other issues that seem to happen that some may say are minor but still super annoying. If you go outside the wireless range of the device and re-enter the range the headset settings will wig out and in some extreme cases reset.<br />3.) Other things are that sometimes when you turn on your computer and it starts booting the drivers it doesn't default into surround sound mode so it goes into this odd crappy stereo mode where the sound is noticeably bad. The drivers glitch out and won't let you turn on the 7.1 surround sound so you have to unplug the device and put it back in for the drivers to get itself together.<br /><br />These minor issuesare annoying but I have come to accept them and once you accept it's not perfect it is really good for what it is. I mean if you have read all the negatives I can guess that you might second guess the idea to get these and that is up to you. I think they are still good even though they have its fair share of problems. I still think it's a 4 star device and I would still recommend them if you want a good wireless headset for the price it's at now. Anything wireless has it's down sides and I accept that so if you can get over the cons of this device then go for it but if you don't like what I said earlier then I suggest you look for a more reliable wireless headset or just get a wired one. Good luck to you friend.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Homeland is one of the most compelling series on television.  The plot is intriguing and continues to surprise.  Love this show!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I like the characters in the book. Different and entertaining cant wait for the movie it is a fun read
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Whether you are a fan or not, this is a well written book.  Scary, imaginative, compelling and so rich on detail you can smell all the smells - good and bad!  At least now I know why people are staring at me when we are driving down the road in the RV . . .
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|What can I say, IT'S CHER and it does not disappoints.  Great dance tunes and some classic ballads make this CD a hit in my opinion.
B00BRJL9J4|5.0|This is pure relaxation music... I've been a Bliss fan years, this CD continues to enchant.  Ambient music at its best.
B00EB6ENXO|4.0|Like the Iron Man movies before, this was fun to watch.  Good CGI and cast, good action and I was entertained.  (That's why I watch them in the first place)  The role of Tony Stark seems a good fit for Robert Downey Jr. and he does it well.  I got a bit more that I expected with this movie and that is always good.  Digital copy is a nice bonus and adds to my Amazon movie list.  I'll be watching it again sometime soon.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Great pic about autism....my son has autism and if I want to explain it to anyone I just give them this film.....
B000E6UK5K|5.0|A fantastic Gilmour's fans studio work. An even better version of the same disk is played wonderfully by Gilmour at the &#34;Remember that Night - Royal Albert Hall&#34; DVD/Blue-ray live show (where Dave's performance is stunning and near perfect). The same does not occur on the &#34;Gdansk Live version of his tour&#34;, unfortunatelly.

B009LDCXNY|5.0|Season 8 premieres eith Dean in purgatory and with the suspense from season 4 when he was in hell you get a excited amd anxious to see how things will play out! A new character is introduced Benny the southern, sexy vampire! Helps Dean escape from Purgatory and plays quite well  in a few latet episodes. Dean being set free goes off to find Sam only to discover he has a whole new life  with a nee lady. Which i personally fimd wonderful because Dean gt to experience a \\"Normal\\" life when Sam tricked the devil and went to hell.

0525478817|5.0|I found the book very engrossing. And I can just say that when reached the middle of the book I just could not help myself but to finish. I liked the characters a lot and their relationship. Very much recommended
B004SBS8LA|5.0|i also enjoy this version, even though im not able to complete some of the stages because i have diabetic neuropathy and fibromylgia which cause numbness to the fingers, but i keep trying.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|some of the stages are impossible to complete for me to complete but it enjoy playing anyway.  i hate those pigs
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful set of love songs, that John Legend could ever have made. Love every song on this CD.  The video, All Of Me, just released and I viewed it, and extraordinarily beautiful.  This couple should get an award for The Most Beautiful couple for: 2013&#34;!!
B007UXSPK2|1.0|MI:GP was an incomprehensible, unremarkable mishmash. I don't know if it happened in editing or was actually written to be &#34;Cruise the Obscure&#34;, but I was bored, bored, bored.  So why did I watch the whole thing?  Who knows?  The alternatives must have been dreadful that day.
B0034G4OYA|4.0|Mavy's life is full of monsters. Her dad is Dracula, and he created the Hotel Transylvania to protect her from humans. (You could say he's a tad over-protective.) Her friends are mummies, Frankenstein monsters, werewolves, and the like. But daddy's little ghoul is all grown up and ready to explore the world. Then one night the unthinkable happens: a teenage human enters Hotel Transylvania, and he and Mavy fall in love.  It's Drac's worst nightmare, and it's very funny.<br /><br />I like this movie a lot, enough to want it in my collection, but I do feel it lacks the tension necessary to make this a great movie.<br /><br />The reason behind Drac's extreme measures for protecting Mavy from humans isn't shown until very late in the movie, which makes it hard to relate to Drac, who is the main character. If that information had come at the start, he would have been easier to identify with, and we would want to see Mavy protected from humans, too. Alternatively, Mavy could have been the main character, because her conflict is real and clear. She wants to explore the world, fall in love, and grow up, but her dear, loving, undead dad won't let her. There's a lot of tension in that. More scenes that brought that out and starting the movie with her growing up, instead of as a baby, could have brought that tension into the movie. I understand why it's done the way it is, though. It's a safe movie for little kids this way, and it does make Adam Sandler the star of the show. Still, this makes it just a fun and funny movie, instead of one that's fun, funny, and really makes you feel.<br /><br />So get it for the kids if they like monsters that aren't scary, or for yourself if you're an Adam Sandler fan.
B005MMY9A8|2.0|Very mediocre tale, acting, everything was blah.  Some of the Marvel superheroes have made it big on the big screen, but Thor was an extreme disappointment all around.  In the olden days, Thor was one of my Marvel favorites, but the trend toward jackasses for heroes, or brooding noir interpretations of our clean-cut favorites and fantasy role models has degraded so many of the genre.  Thor is just one more under-produced, poorly acted attempt to bring the old Marvel magic into &#34;modern&#34; times.
0679805273|5.0|This beautiful book looks at the ups and downs of life and encourages the reader or listener to believe in him or herself no matter what. It makes a great gift to a recent graduate or anyone who has recently set off on a new path. Oh, the places you will go...
B0035JNTA6|5.0|I like pure-fun comedies, and this is one of the best I've seen.  If you like that style of movie, I recommend it highly&#62;
B002PQ7JQK|4.0|The great thing about this set is that it comes with both the original and enhanced versions.  Great - so we get to watch each episode twice.  We know we will :).
B002VPE1WK|5.0|First, let me tell you that I saw this bag for the first time on a friend who is a big guy over 6 feet.  I'm 5'5&quot; and female.  When I saw the bag I was immediately struck by the size.  It's small enough to fit me!  So many of the bags are just too big for my frame but the smallest bags will not carry my lenses and accessories.<br />When I received my bag I immediately packed it with my travel gear: a Nikon D600 with a 16-85 lens attached, and a 70-300, 105 macro, 60 macro, 12-28 wide angle, 28mm, 50mm, and my Lens Baby and my battery charger..  Everything fit perfectly!  The bag also has interior compartments to hold all the little stuff - lens cleaner, remote, clothes, filters, extra cards,small flash light etc.  These compartments are clear mesh reinforced for easy viewing. On the outside there are two other small side pockets for 'other stuff'.<br />After loading all my gear I tried the bag on and was happy to discover that the shoulder padding and the waist strap made the pack very comfortable to wear while walking.  I think it would  be possible to attach a small tri-pod to the bag too but mine is large and I like to use it as a hiking stick so I didn't do that.<br />My only complaint is the interior color.  It's the usual almost black color.  A lighter color interior would make things easier to see in dark conditions (i.e. night shoots).  But I am incredibly happy with this little bag!  And it was less than $30.00 - unbelievable.
B005LAIIN0|2.0|While a did enjoy the movie it left me sadly disappointed. Beside the title, this film has absolutely nothing in common with the book beside a worldwide zombie outbreak. I recommend the audiobook for those desiring a more theatrical interpretation of the book.
B009LDD54K|5.0|\\"Boardwalk Empire: Season Three\\"<br />(HBO, 2013)<br />. . .<br /><br />This year, I've found myself disappointed by several high-profile cable dramas -- notably, \\"Dexter,\\" \\"Nurse Jackie\\" and to a lesser extent \\"Breaking Bad,\\" which was still strong going into the home stretch, but a little bit wobbly in the first half of the final season.<br /><br />Not so with \\"Boardwalk Empire.\\"  Fueled by Steve Buscemi's seething performance as uber-antihero Nucky Thompson, the series is probably the most consistently high-quality show on cable TV, circa 2013. The level of writing, acting and production matches the taut, flawless, compelling drama of \\"Deadwood,\\" and \\"The Wire\\" -- exhalted company where the show's producers never hit lulls and refuse to coast or pad things out. The program is always compelling, the writing is concise and well-structured, and everything you see on screen looks great. The only weak spot comes with the over-the-top portrayal of Bobby Cannavale's gangster character, \\"Gyp\\" Rosetti, but even with the oooh-he's-into-kinky-sex tedium, Rosetti is a truly terrifying, menacing antagonist, and Cannavale puts in one of his best career performances with this meaty role. Overall, \\"Boardwalk Empire\\" isn't just a winner, it's a stunner. Highly recommended!  (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue movie reviews)
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|The first charger I received was too big to fit either the Honda Odyssey or the Mini Cooper Countryman cigarette lighters.  I wrote a review stating so.  Anker Customer service followed up and sent me a replacement.  Thank You Anker.  The second charger is working as advertised.  I am very happy with Anker and would recommend them to others.
0345803485|1.0|This 'book' was absolutely awful. Not even in an \\"well, it's entertaining\\" sort of way, but in a cringe-worthy way.<br />The only reason why I got through the entire thing was I listened to it on audio, whilst doing other things (unfortunately not masturbating. This would have never gotten me 'there'). If I actually read the physical book, I would have never, ever gotten all the way through it. It was too awful.<br />There's not much else I can say that hasn't already been said. The plot is horrible. The writing is more horrible, and the lead female character is most horrible of all.<br />It's sexist, vain, stupid, and boring. Almost all positive reviews I gotten from this book were by people who don't normally read. That's all you really need to know.<br />If you don't know how to read, or have never read anything good, you might enjoy this.
B009DH2PP4|5.0|Perfect for the home brewer looking to get started in extracts or one that wants to go to the next level.
B009QW7HMC|5.0|Damn! How many more go down before you just go completely out of your mind. Sean of course deserved it trying to take Rick's family away. That really didn't bother me so much. Then Lori meets her demise and Rick just loses it and I myself was in despair. Then the despicable Governor who you just could not wait for Michonne to take one of his eyes out. The end of Season 3 saw Andrea finally get knocked off (that one made me shed a few tears and I was pissed.) I wanted her to get out of the weird relationship with the Gov and get back with the group, but every time she did the wrong damn thing, crap! Now Carl is acting even more stranger then ever and your thinking what is going to happen with that kid??? The best part was when Merle finally gets it just one time (Yeah!). He lets Michonne go just when you thought he'd never. Wanted to give that racist redneck one big slap on the back. Before I could he was axed also by our devious no good demented human, The Governor. Now I can't wait for Season 4 if only to see The Governor come back so someone can kill him real slow like. Maybe Michonne wacks off one finger at a time or puts his other eye out. I watched seasons 1-3 over again on Netflix in about 4 days time. Just finished season 3 today. First time around I think I missed about 6 episodes. The best series I have ever seen. Hate it when someone from the first group gets the axe. Sad the way Dale got it (even though sometimes he can get on your nerves, usually he was right though). Carl screwed up by going after a Walker and it got loose and killed Dale later. So many twists and turns. Rick is only human since he makes a lot of mistakes only to make up for most of them later. Way too much to put on one mans shoulders. As he states \\"It's not me anymore making decisions, it's US\\". As well it should be. Glen getting beat to hell by Merle and Maggie forced to take her top off by The Governor makes it a non-stop action thriller. Damn! That Governor is one sick SOB. Heads in an aquarium and keep his Walker daughter to try and sooth her. Whew! Hello! How many of you just love this series? Tell us ALL why.<br /><br />Update: For those that give this series one star. Most of these 80 1 star reviews are because it will not play on their device: Computer, Ipad, TV or whatever. These reviews mean nothing about the show itself. Then the few others that state how horrible The Walking Dead is. Hello! You have over 5,000 5 star and about 20 1 star that dislike the series itself. Usually when a product is reviewed a 10 to 1 ratio means it's usually pretty damn good. In this case taking out the the complaints not about the show itself but can't play it. The ratio is like 250 to one. which means of course that only 1% or less (you always will get a select few that you can not please no matter what. Forget those one percent because they mean next to nothing. This series is the best that has ever been on TV, ever! Read the reviews, Watch the Walking Dead Panels. They are knocking folks DEAD, period! Those are the facts. I and 99+% of the people can not wait for Season 4 (one week to go!). Get your popcorn ready........
B008LUM0G8|5.0|Excellent book an interesting storyline with plenty of action, quick thinking and sheer luck combined to see the heroes through to the end

One that will take him on a journey of spiritual and personal growth. This is a book that will draw you in as you learn with Nate. It has a level of intensity that makes it difficult to put down. Very well written and a thrill to read.

B005WTR4ZI|4.0|This (very) short book clearly states the points of view present in recent scholarly discussion of the effects of IT on the U.S. labor force.  It illustrates these points with lots of references to the general literature, written for a general audience.  I had hoped to use the book as a source of references that I could use to dig deeper.  I should have known better than to use a Kindle version for that, despite its very low price.  The Kindle version includes no direct citations--for example, no footnotes or list of references.  Instead, it offers links to documents available on the Web.  Accessing those links was a serious pain in the neck on my Kindle.  And you usually can't read them without paying to access each one.  Maybe it would work better if I had read the Kindle document on a computer with better access to the Web.  I finally gave up; I'll get a hard copy if I decide to access those citations.  How many times must I remind myself:  Total user cost, not price, dummy!<br /><br />I am trained as an economist and found that the book uses carefully reasoned arguments that go well beyond my specific training but are thoroughly compatible with it.  The book seemed to shift gears in the closing section when getting to recommendations.  Apparently, the authors set out to write a different book than they offer here and decided to return to their original agenda at the end.  I'm comfortable with the recommendations offered.  They come from the standard economist's playbook; I could have made many of them myself without reading the book.  But for the most part, the discussion in the body of the book does not motivate the recommendations at the end.  Read the book for an improved understanding of the problem, and the ideas being discussed around this problem, not for the recommendations.  You are likely to have heard most of them already, even if you know little about this topic.
0394826817|3.0|The only thing I don't like about Scarry's books is that the text is so small and the pages are always super busy with words. It's not as fun to read because either the text is small for adults to read to a child, plus the text is kind of all over the place; or the words are more difficult for a beginner reader to do my himself.
B006L0A5P8|5.0|Love this app, it has a much better memory than I do and as such, I use complex/strong passwords w/o any worries...only having to remember the ONE password to get into the app and it does the rest.  The other parts of the app - like wallet and notes (both secure) are also very nice additions and they all sync very well across all devices.  Good product.
2070612759|5.0|I first read this book in third-year high school French class.  It was a challenge, and some of its depth eluded me, but I was glad and blessed to have had the introduction.  It is a profound meditation on love, friendship, vulnerability and mortality.  Don't be ashamed if the end makes you weep.
B007SGM084|3.0|I would recommend reading this book for something fun to read. First book was slow but second and third book were better. Can't wait for the movies.
B00009NHC5|5.0|I  remember seeing this movie when it first came out. I was 14 at the time. I remembered it to be a very good suspense thriller. When seeing it again after all these years, it is still as exciting as I remember.
0385743564|4.0|I am a big fan of Sanderson and always get anything he releases right away.  I was enthralled with Elantris and the Mistborn trilogy and of course Way of Kings is incredible.  I also liked The Rithmatist (and Alcatraz!) and thought that while the story flow and \\"themes\\" of that book were very similar to other YA novels in the same vein (Riordan, etc), the actual story was very unique and magic/chalk system very fun to explore and learn about.<br /><br />Enter Steelheart.  As always, the book moves along quickly and Sanderson's mix of intrigue/world building with fast paced action makes this novel very difficult to put down.  I finished it in about 5 sittings over the course of 1 week and found myself excited to get home so I could keep reading.<br /><br />I wish there was a 4.5 star review option I could use; this is a really great book and I really enjoyed reading it, but I just can't give it 5 stars.  The reason is because the setting, characters, prose, pacing, etc. are all the same as his previous work, and most of the ideas of the novel are a mish-mosh of various movies/comic books.  I understand that you could say that about any fantasy novel nowadays, but this one just seems like the similarities to other works is constantly in your face.  Sanderson basically takes an \\"X-Men\\" style world of \\"superheroes\\" (super villains, in this case) with \\"super powers\\" and slightly elaborates on it.  The concept of the Epics having weaknesses is very cool, as well as the different types of Epics, but \\"Newcago\\" might as well have been Gotham in the Dark Knight Rises with villains having super powers.  Sanderson tries to include some indications that there were still scientists trying to understand what was going on in the world, but the explanation to come in future books (one would assume) is going to have to be VERY creative, because right now everything is very conveniently happening to create a perfect post-apocalyptic world just waiting for a hero story.<br /><br />Themain character, David, also didn't hit my emotional radar.  I could not relate to him - the concept of a growing child focusing 100% of his efforts on compiling information about Epics to try to get revenge on them was difficult to get my head around.  Sure, I could understand his hatred of them and wanting to get revenge, but the results of his independent \\"research\\" and all of his brainstorming (all preserved perfectly) just seem way above what is possible from a boy of 16 (or whatever) even despite incredible circumstances.  In fact, if you replace \\"Epics\\" with \\"Chalk Drawings\\", the character is very similar to the main character in The Rithmatist in many ways, though the world in The Rithmatist really made that situation much more believable.<br /><br />My review may seem harsh and I actually feel kind of bad about it - if I was asked to pick one \\"favorite\\" author that consistently delivers it would be Sanderson, and I was NOT disappointed in this book and I enjoyed reading it very much, but the book was a little \\"cookie cutter\\" and for fans of Sanderson like myself who are used to incredibly creative settings and emotionally connectable characters it didn't completely satisfy me.

B00B9366VO|5.0|I'm glad I know a little more background to some of the music I grew up with and still enjoy. I hope musicians will continue to insist on good quality recordings.
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|This was recommended to me by a friend who knows I am a fan of Dream Theater and Mike Portnoy.  I was at first surprised that this was not in the expected progressive vein for Portnoy.  This is just straightforward, ass-kicking rock.  The singer (Richie Kotzen) is really good and has a great &#34;rock growl&#34; that you may remember from Mr. Big.  They get great sound from a 3-piece outfit and Portnoy is solid as always behind the drums.  They are actually playing locally here this weekend and I think I am going to check out their live show.  Highly recommended album - you will play it over and over.
0307959856|3.0|It was a very fast read, but definitely not like a classic literature.  A bit too modern sensibilities, not following Jane Austin other than details
B000AJIF4E|4.0|Excellent sound compared to my older Bose headphones which I still like more than this set.  The simple reason is that the Bose are FAR more comfortable than these.  I go on forty-five minute walks with my new iPod and these are good for sound, but my head just simply starts hurting right when I start walking with them.  I don't want to discourage others from trying them, hence the four stars.  The only reason I got these is because I got a $50 gift card for my birthday.  Give them a try!
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|It was captivating. So sad and hard to believe it could happen. Amazing she could rise above the horrors of her past and move on.  Awesome spirit she has!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Perfect follow up to story of Danny Torrence. The fact that he faces similar demons to those faced by his father(alcohol) and doesn't just have a happy ending after \\"The Shining\\" makes it very believable and realistic. Even with all his issues you find yourself very much rooting for Danny to succeed. The \\"evil\\" in this story is so creative and so something you come across all over America it makes you wonder if Mr.King knows something the rest of us don't! I highly recommend this story to all readers of Stephen King, especially those who have read The Shining. Honestly though if you saw the movie you can get by. There was only one major difference between them and that is referenced immediately. Lots of power, noble characters and one exceptionally talented girl who you hope to also read about one day in the future. Great read , I'm only sorry I finished already...
0394826817|5.0|This is a book that I remember fondly from my childhood so I was excited to purchase it for my children.  My two year old daughter loves it because it has so many great animal characters and the illustrations are great.  She's already memorized many of their names.  It's a great way to introduce kids to manners in a fun way.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love puzzles and found this new type of puzzle interesting and it keeps me entertained. It's very relaxing and enjoyable.
B00F08ADX6|4.0|I actually really enjoyed this game quite a bit. There's a sense that it&acute;s not quite complete yet, as I keep wishing for more scenery or something else to do. Maybe I haven&acute;t played long enough yet but the gamer in me keeps hoping for more of an experience to the game. Still, what&acute;s here is actually very good and conveys a real sense of innocence and serenity like a good dream should.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I loved the story, but was hard to follow because of the number of characters you had to keep track of.  I would recommend reading this in a short period of time.  Otherwise, you have to back track to figure out the story line again.  Of the three books Khaled Hosseini has written, I personally would rank this third.

1250012570|3.0|ELEANOR & PARK was not on my radar until I heard about the controversy surrounding it. Everyone has their own opinion; mine was outrage. So what better way to support a book that's trying to be banned then to read it and see why? And I am so glad I did.<br /><br />There are not-so-pretty things which are dealt with here: bullying, abuse, denial and anger. Eleanor has to face these every day, not just at school, but at home. Her stepfather is a constant threat throughout and her mom barely acknowledges anything's wrong. Park wonders if he's \\"man enough\\" in the eyes of his father, and wonders about himself because he's half Asian growing up in 1980s Nebraska.<br /><br />Eleanor's relationship with Park isn't neat and tidy, but it is sweet. They obviously care about each other. Eleanor can be difficult and Park can move fast at times, but I was rooting for both of them. Near the end of the book, I was in tears. It's been a long time since I cried so hard over a book. Yes, it's first love at its finest. This novel has some of the most beautiful lines about love.<br /><br />(p. 76) He made her feel more than the sum of her parts.<br />(p. 299) He tried to remember how it had happened, how she went from someone he'd never met to the only one who mattered.<br />(p. 302) This kiss had to last Park forever. It had to get him home. He needed to remember it when he woke up scared in the middle of the night.<br /><br />My reason for the three stars is the way information is given. It's simple: there's the school, Park's house, Eleanor's house, but I didn't know anyone's last names or who was who until the middle of the book. I thought it was strange that this was revealed so far into the novel. Also, I felt like there were some essential bits missing--like certain parts were just outlines for other things that never happened. There are a few unresolved questions, but I think these were purposefully left vague for the reader to interpret the way they wanted.<br /><br />All in all, if this novel is controversial, then I'm reading more like it. I was shaken up and beyond the moon that I had the chance to read this. If you get the chance to do, I recommend trying it out.l, if this novel is controversial, then I'm reading more like it.

B00D3NSDVO|5.0|EXICITING READ, GOOD PLOT AND A THOUGHT PROVOKING LOOK AT THE NEW AGE OF TERRORISM. NOT TO BE MISSED BY ALL LOVERS OF THRILLERS
B00CIFK316|5.0|If you like Sherlock Holmes you will really enjoy this book. Because it is in a short story format, it is easy to read if you only have 15 min between appts, etc.<br /><br />The mind of Sherlock an the relationship between he and Dr Watson is expanded upon throughout their adventures. It gives a nice glimpse into the culture and habits of the years they lived in as well.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|If you are a fan of Neil Gaiman or adult fairy tales, you'll like this book. It was engaging, a little funny, a little scary - in a nutshell wonderfully Neil Gaiman. It felt a little bit short to be called a novel and I wanted more after I was done.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Complex and startling.  It was a great read.  Very hard to put down.  Brand new idea to write a story about. Keeps the reader involved from beginning to end.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  The story really keeps you interested.  I liked that there was some action in this book.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|enjoyed this movie but didn,t have the excitement as the previous movie had.  don,t think i will ever use the download.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Skyfall is the ultimate best James Bond movie ever made, and its finally mine!!  I saw that Amazon had it for a great price and I couldn't say no! I ordered it on Sunday, and received it on Wednesday! Pretty damn lickety split! It played beautiful and in beautiful HD. It arrived in a nice tan colored envelope also containing an invoice of the transaction with return stickers in case anything was wrong with the dvd! Good idea for a seller to do that because it says to me, the customer, that the seller stands behind their products!<br />I would be happy to do business with them again!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Still can't believe that this was free ! Fun for all ages! I am addicted to this game ! I definitely would recommend it !
B008Y212PI|2.0|I played the tutorial, the app Force Closed; started the app, again, and played the tutorial again to see if the issue was consistent and received another Force Close.<br /><br />I was able to just complete the tutorial before it died on me.<br /><br />MOTOROLA DROID X
B002QNTNL6|5.0|This movie is excellent it show that no matter how long the distance you can succeed in making your wish come true.  I think the character were excellent.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|love it, digital on my phone! I can read and hightlight, keeps my page from where I left off every time I open it.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I had enjoyed this app, until yesterday. I used Kik in Monday and two days later, the app just won't let me log in.....AT ALL!!!!!!! BEYOND mad!!!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Adobe Reader is a necessity, and I really appreciate its ease of use. If there is another product that does the same thing I don't care.  This is number one with me.
B00BWYFTNG|5.0|Very cool piece to any fan of the walking dead. Great buy and fast shipping. Amazing details at a very good price. Get two great characters very well worth the money
B00133KDM8|3.0|this album has like an opera with combine with rock and a little hard rock. This women has a very interesting voice like apera
0312430000|3.0|It is a little more difficult than I thought a children's game would be.  Also the timer on the arm is very touchy.
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|With this one you get all the good classic Michael Videos with a story line a must have for a true fan!
B005HSL626|5.0|An addictve game I really enjoy playing it... I have nothing else to say but have to say more to post hat's done
6304711905|5.0|This is my mother's favorite movie to watch on a Saturday morning.  Definitely a classic.  Fast shipping and movie played great.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|The DVD arrived quickly and in great condition.  There is a great moral to this story but strong language in a few places.
B00CSCJ09K|5.0|great mix of rock & classical variations of music.  Slight crack in jewel case, but still okay.  Great sound qualtity in the recording.  It met my expectations quite well.  Thank you.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|This movie has lots of heart, and a good, simple story, based on fact, told in an easy-going manner. However, if you're into car chases and action, this isn't the one for you. But if you like thoughtful, solid movies, this is a nice one. Richard Farnsworth, may he rest in peace, is wonderful in the film, as ever, and Sissy Spacek is excellent, of course. I owned it in VHS and now in DVD. It truly is a keeper.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This game is super addicting. Love every second of it. Did NOT disappoint. When choosing I recommend purchasing it, though. That way you have little to no ads.
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|Only The game at first is incredible but after several hours even it becomes incredibly repetitive. I still play it here and there but nothing ever changes and sometimes the controls don't work but it still pretty good.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I always told myself I would never buy this game. Then they made a Star Wars version. I couldn't help myself. Now, I am completely addicted.
1476727651|5.0|If you don't think so, you are wrong.  A strong story, harkening back to The Shining, but not too much.  I re-read The Shining before starting Dr. Sleep to refresh my memory but it is not necessary to do so to follow the plot.  I don't want to be a spoiler so I will just say it is a worthwhile read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game has so many interesting levels. And each one becomes slightly more difficult than the last. I enjoy a challenge and if you do too this game is definitely worth trying.
B00DHRLK84|2.0|That is what i was yelling at the screen as I watched this poor excuse for a horror movie.  Bad science...bad plotting...OK acting.  Brad Pitt is lovely to look at but what ever possessed him to make this movie?
B00005AWMF|5.0|Her voice is so unique and beautiful you can't stop listening to it.Such an incredible artist. Such a beautiful lyrics.Every track is amazing. One of the most beautiful CDs you ever buy. If you love music you have to have this CD.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I bought this book because of an interest in religious history. The reviews piqued my interest, and I found it true to what most reviews had to say. When discussing it with my very religious sister, even she felt it was true to pure  historical truth, though she did not approve of the lack of spirituality.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Very entertaining...very cleverly done...kept me in suspense...would love to see more of these type of movies.  Reminded me of Oceans Eleven.
B00DW5IM9Q|4.0|i hesistated to get this though I usually buy everything Dylan as soon as it comes out.  Wasn't crazy about Self Portrait originally.  I was greatly surprised by the many true hidden jewels that there are in this collection.  It is fabulous to hear new songs from Dylan with his voice still in good shape.  You should buy this if you are a Dylan addict or casual fan.  It is worth it just to get a copy of this version of &#34;If Not For You&#34; by itself.  You won't regret it.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|The previews made it out to be so much better than it actually was.  For some reason, Leonardo did not fit the part.  Did not like how it ended.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|It used to be very user friendly... have no idea what and why it changed but it's going &#34;bye bye&#34; my fair weather friend
B008HJGPVO|4.0|A basic tool for those of us of a certain age with shakey hands.  It works! I recmmend it .
B0093FNZT6|4.0|Comforting to read after losing a loved one and it's an interesting perspective hearing the story from a neurosurgeon who understands how the brain works whilst also having experienced what he did.
1476727651|1.0|I hesitate to write any negative reviews of books I've read because I've run into some real hostility from people who don't agree with me, but here goes.<br /><br />I am a devoted Stephen King fan and have read everything he's written, both fiction and non-fiction. I eagerly anticipated the release of this book and boy, was I disappointed.<br /><br />In my opinion (and it's just my opinion), this is one of the worst books that King has ever written. It's just plain silly and more than a little boring.  I won't go into details because I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but....yuck.  I just hated it.<br /><br />In general I found that it lacked a good story, had poor character development, and seemed to be grasping at straws to make it interesting (failed).<br /><br />The names of the \\"bad guys\\" characters were ridiculous, although I was amused by King's nod to Silence of the Lambs (naming a very minor character \\"Frederika Bimmel).  Cute.<br /><br />Sorry Mr. King. This is, in my opinion, an epic fail.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|A unique plot line with some fantasy and magic involved. The last third fell down a bit in terms of a contrived ending but overall it was a very satisfying read. I recommend it.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|It is very easy to access You Tube using the Kindle Fire HD. The download time is excellent and the screen is easy to read.
B005MMY5RK|4.0|A significant movie indeed.  Not the best ever.  It certainly is a movie everyone should see.  Orion Welles has an amazing presence.
0762445262|4.0|Was the perfect gift for who it was intended for but the light could have been a bit brighter.  Still loved it!

B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Great storyline, keeps you wanting to keep the storyline going! Megan has to come back to the Reckoners. Don't want to spoil the excitement of telling too much!
B005OK722U|4.0|Hostel: Part III (2011) Direct-to-DVD. Unrated Version. One hour, 27 mins.<br />Directed by Scott Spiegel. Written by Michael D. Weiss.<br /><br />No one from [[ASIN:B007HOD2WA Hostel Unrated]] (2005) and [[ASIN:B007IXTNQ4 Hostel Part II Unrated]] (2007) are in this third and last movie.<br /><br />Travis (Chris Coy) is walking in a hotel in Las Vegas.

B00886XQO0|4.0|Just a short review of the Tango.<br />So having used these for a while I can tell you that comfort is nice and has improved as they switched to memory foam instead of their usual mesh which can be uncomfortable. One thing to note is the headset smallest length setting was still sitting a bit loose on my head so if you have a small head this might be the case.<br /><br />The design is good but its the same deign as the XP500 just with BO2 colors. There's a ton of features that im sure you already know of.<br /><br />Now the sound quality is very good a 9/10. Obviously you can sound whore with this headset and don't worry about it not being 7.1 because consoles can only ever output 5.1 through the optical cable so 7.1 is not true. You can play your games and listen to music wireless. Great to have for games like GTA when your playing single player.<br /><br />I would give it a 10/10 for sound but turtle beach they just lack that bass rich sound. I tried the sound editor and removed the ear guard which gives the headset a lot more volume and I selected the bass preset that the headset has and adjusted the bass to max. It did improve but not to the level I was expecting for a $300 headset. When you hear a frag go off or any explosion you should really hear some deep bass sounds but you just don't get that with this even using the bass preset.<br />When I bought this headset I was hoping for a all in one wireless headset where I could listen to music, watch movies and game. There's just not enough bass that I'm used to with other headsets especially when your paying a high price. This might not be an issue for some people in which case this could be the right headset for you.<br /><br />These are definitely better than its rival the Astro A50.
B00004XPPE|5.0|Many years ago, I watched this on a blurry black and white tv, all the while hoping to see it again. I never did and I was very pleased upon seeing this available on Amazon. The story is intense and gripping from beginning to end. It is very well played out and keeps you on the edge and in amazement, wondering could this really happen?
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Long time fan of Star Trek and this one didn't disappoint.  Full of action with great special effects.  Highly recommend.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I LOVE it ,it helps surfing storms and the updates and the map! I just never found a app that was as thorough with the weather as this one is.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This game is awesome even though its $3.00 but its totally worth it you can create their hair all crazy or make it like super stars what you want your hair to look like when you are older if you like hair games I recommend it to you I want to own or work at a hair salon I like braiding my hair but I love it it is not a rip off at all its so fun and silly it makes boring times go by fast it doesn't take forever to download it is like a normal free game but you do have to sign in on amazon but it does not take a long time
1442362952|1.0|did not realize I was buying an MP3 audio cd. my portable player does not play mp3, so i can only listen to it on my computer. story line not interesting enough to spend the time required sitting at my computer.
B00DNO2LFC|5.0|Despite never having heard of this film before, it was excellent.  Plot, screenplay, and acting were deserving of it's awards.
B004TN7QPG|4.0|I like it but wut wish it had more font options. I also cant get certain books to appear double paged,  wish I could do that but other than that pretty useful reading app!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Even when I lose - that gopher cracks me up.  Totally love this game.<br />The belly laugh was fabulous but when he stuck his tongue out - I was a goner!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I did not understand the diversion with the doctor, yet I thought the author could have told us more about Iqbal's life.<br />Sometimes the back and forth in the past and present are difficult to follow especially with so many characters.
B008SVFX96|5.0|This is an  amazing CD! The songs are so cool! Richie really  out did himself on this one! Highly recommend
B00ECL7ZJ2|1.0|Saw these girls poppin' up everywhere a few months ago.  I liked the look.  Down to Earth.  Innocent, but yet dangerous.  I had yet to hear their music, but assumed by their appearance that it would be some sweet ol garage rock girls rock revival.  A few months went by...<br /><br />Heard them compared to Fleetwood Mac.  Saw them get BNMed.  Heard they opened for U2 (which made me a little skeptical.)  So I had to check em out.<br /><br />I was shocked by what I heard.  First off by how terrible it sounded.  Second, by the crazy professional production behind their music.  This was not what their image had portrayed.  Were they trying to fool me?  Haim?  You naughty naughty girls!  They've got some muscle behind this record.  Not that I have anything wrong with the corporate sound.  I love it all.  But this is trying to pass itself off as something it ain't.<br /><br />I could hear the similarities to the Mac only in that the lead singer sounded like Christine McVie.  To me it sounded more like Lisa Lisa and the Cult Jam on steroids.  Don't get me wrong.  Lost in Emotion was, and still is, my jam.  But holy production!  Maybe there are some good songs here, but I couldn't hear em with all the techniques involved.<br /><br />They started to feel creepy to me.  I pictured all those studio executives around these girls...creepy!<br />It's kind like that girl who got all dressed up in the little kid beauty pageants and then was missing and they thought her parents did it and it was really big news.  And whenever I saw a picture of her, it creeped me out.  That's how I feel listening to Haim.<br /><br />They are a lot like the band Rush.  There is a lot of promise in their music, but no delivery.  You hear that first note, and there is hope, but then they just go on to do something dumb and ruin it.  Or like when Lenny Kravits did his \\"American Woman\\" cover...people were like...Whao?  So hot!<br /><br />Not at all.<br /><br />I think sometimes people want to be acceptedand that makes them weak.  And in that weak moment they listen to Haim.  And think they have to like it.  To be loved.<br /><br />I can also see this band ruining a lot of chicks' highschool experience.  Like you think you gotta have fun your senior year.  Hiam looks like fun.  So you and your girls get all Haimed out and learn all the lyrics to the songs.  So you're in the car with your boyfriend.  Driving around.  Stinging along to stupid Hiam songs and he starts to get disgusted with you.  Starts to find you unattractive.  Looks at your mouth singing and never wants to kiss it again.  You tell him to shut up.  You pick up your girlfriend.  He has to sit in the back seat all night listening to two 17 year old girls sing Hiam songs.  You don't hear from him again.  No prom.  No smooching.  You're in your room.  With your thoughts.  Alone with Haim.<br /><br />I'm not against Prom Rock in any way shape or form.  There is a great catalogue from the past to pull from.  As well as two great Prom Rock albums released this year by Wavves and Mickal Cronin.<br /><br />I ain't sayin' they are as gawd awful a band as Pearl Jam or anything.  As far as awful goes, Pearl Jam always takes the cake. There is an audience for this band.  And it ain't for kids looking to get wasted and have a good time.  This is for kids driving to bible camp, trying to act all rebellious.  Actually, I don't even know who this was made for.  But it ain't me.<br /><br />Farmer Ted
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I thought this book was very much on point. It was written in a very practical way. The experiments were easy and fun. I recommend this book to anyone who is awakened to their true self and is seeking to get to know it better. Five stars
B00985E3UG|4.0|You won't be shocked or outraged by anything in this book. Our brains and bodies are hardwired to crave foods high in salt, sugar, and fat. The food industry has done its best to cater to our baser instincts and sell us the food that's the worst for us. And sometimes, they cross lines of deceptive advertising, spurious studies, or unfair competition. Stop the presses.<br /><br />That said, this book is still very informative and interesting. You'll learn about the rise of the breakfast cereal, fast food, and soft drink industries. You'll learn why the switch to prepared foods has made our diets so much more unhealthy. And you'll learn exactly why salt is bad for you, and why it's the one irreplaceable ingredient in most foods on the shelves. In short, this book will help you to rethink your diet and perhaps make some small favorable changes to it.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Looks like it will be fun. Just installed it yesterday. Like any other Game Insights game, any time you make measurable progress the game crashes. When you go back in, you \\"mysteriously\\" don't get presented with the same opportunities and have to spend game coins or do a lot more work to make that same progress again. I swear they do this so that we get frustrated and just buy our way back to where we got before. I've tried running their games with the synch turned on and off and it crashes either way.
B004KZOWEG|4.0|An eye-opening experience. England gets a bad reputation for bloodthirsty imperialism in the third world, but we largely forget about what Belgium did in the Congo. The millions of Africans killed in the slave and forced labor trade. We shouldn't forget.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|I'm a cat owner, so I'm probably biased, but I loved this story where 1 + 1 is way more than the sum of the parts.  Two lives transformed in a good way, and Bob is such an amazing cat.  A very easy read, and very insightful into the lives of street people and how most of us try to ignore them without understanding their circumstances.  Heartwarming and enlightening, I highly recommend it to animal lovers, and anyone interested in a story with a positive message.  Great to see James helping people out with the proceeds from sales.
B00AHGSVKS|4.0|Very vague spoilers - but can you really be spoiled by a book that came out 60 years ago? This book is the anti-Independence Day, the anti-War of the Worlds. If aliens really wanted to take over, they wouldn't bomb the White House and allow President Bill Pullman to make the most inspiring speech of his acting career. They wouldn't invade a planet without getting vaccinated against the most common bacteria contained therein. No, they would take their time. They'd lull us into a false sense of security with claims of peace (like \\"V\\"). They'd promise to share their wondrously advanced technology with us to cure societal ills without actually explaining how it works (like \\"V\\"). They'd subdue our creative focus while turning us into sheep for the invading force (man, did the creators of V pay Arthur Clarke's estate royalties?). But unlike V, there is no fifth column of resistance; in fact, the only humans with a spark of fire left retreat to an isolated community and leave the rest of society to be assimilated.<br /><br />Depressing book - but a revealing book about humanity's hubris... and dimwitted docility. 60 years later, everyone walks down the street consuming technology and media, oblivious to those around them but sharing private information nonetheless, and you think, it would be so much easier to conquer us now.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I used to like Yahoo a lot more than I do now. My primary problem is how difficult to simply log in. It seems that every time I turn around I have to log in again. I understand that security is a big issue, and maybe it's  just me, but I don't like this product like I used to. If I wasn't so lazy I probably would have done so and I don't rule it out for the future.
B009LMTDL0|2.0|From the admitted point of view of an upper middle class white male, Sheryl Sandberg's book still feels like the Seven Habits of Highly Effective Women in Positions of Privilege. To other women in the upper middle class and above, it dispenses pithy chapters of advice that they already knew anyway, but may not have thought about in that particular context. To others, it highlights the hard socioeconomic truth that leaning in is simply not enough to get ahead in life - be you a working mother or a blue collar man. You need the luxury of having a socioeconomic net to lean INTO. In other words, it's a nice rear view mirror for those who have already driven over the glass speed bumps.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|Not that good with hard problems but good enough but it is ok enjoy . But be careful what u buy
B00746O3X8|5.0|This is perfect for what I needed it for. Hands free hiking with my camera ready in an instant! Easy to put on and off, comfortable and ready access to my Pentax K5-II. The price was right! Is wearing well after three hikes.
B00E0SX118|5.0|What a great movie. So funny throughout! One of the rare films that truly appeals to the entire family. Looking forward to watching it again and again.
1603420398|4.0|I like this book for ideas to try for new patterns and designs.  I've managed to create different shapes and how to join them.  It's fun.
B00DHHWYAW|3.0|Not what I expected from a Great Gatsby treatment. Definitely different. Mildly disconcerting and entertaining at the same time. DiCaprio was terrific.
B009QU9X44|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read!! Unpredictable, funny and real! Loved it!!<br />Highly recommend it! Must read!
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|We have a coat closet with no easy access to running an electric line in. Originally tried one of those &#34;as seen on TV' stick up light fixtures. It gave off about the light of a 15 watt bulb, and the batteries ran down quickly. I bought two of these lights, placed one high to see the coats above the hangers, and the other low to light up the items that are on the floor. I am very pleased. The light is relatively bright for the dark closet, and the motion sensing works very well. It has a relatively quick shut off time, but an easy solution is to just move a bit. I originally was looking for a battery light with a simple switch arrangement that could work two or more lights, but I didn't find any that seemed to meet my criterion. Actually I'm glad I got these lights, since I don't even have to concern myself with switching them on and off, and no worrying about running the battery down by forgetting to turn them off!
B002TLSSXO|4.0|These are great!  Only reason I didn't give them five stars is they cannot be left in a hot pan.  I have gifted them to my Mom and she loved them too!

B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book kept me interested from beginning to end--no boring spots! Intriguing that the only one in the book that was really in denial until the very end was the lawyer-father. The ending was surprising, especially the way that Jacob's mother decided to &#34;solve the problem&#34;.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|It was a really good movie. Kept us entertained the entire movie  I would recommend this movie it was very good
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It's been a while that I given a movie 5 stars but this one really deserved it. It was very exciting and had me guessing til the end.

B004XZR63M|5.0|Robert Kiyosaki definitely changes your point of view about cashflow and your personal finances. This book is a &#34;must read&#34; for anyone who wants to take control of their finances. Although not the ultimate guide to become rich it is a really good starting point
B00594XOZU|1.0|I never logged out of my kik but now it loads forever then says come back later. I do but it still does the same thing. -_- before the update on the kindle came it worked fine.
B000VR824S|5.0|Fantastic guitar playing! Very entertaining. Put in on the big screen, hit the surround sound and crank it up! Very good.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Fun songs. Not all of them are to my taste, but more than your average album.<br /><br />Can't wait for the next one.
B005FPT51K|5.0|I use this for checking on my MOm who has Alzheimers.  All her caretakers have Iphones or Ipads. We all check in on her via this monitor, even when another of us is taking care of her.  IT works great and gives great piece of mind. ;)
B000VK99Z6|5.0|Would I watch this over and over again? Yarp! One of my all time favorites. Very wide appeal, with something for everyone, assuming everyone has a sense of humor of some kind. I guess if you don't, the scenery is still pretty.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|What is the point of the game if it makes you restart. Very frustrating. My kids are so disappointed. Don't buy!!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|good plot<br />good action<br />just need to get those two together to make a good action movie.<br />That's all it needs.
B009LDD1X0|2.0|This DVD set was on back-order and it took FOREVER to get to me. So we were really excited when it finally got here, but then we went to watch it and we had two disc #1, then disc #3--but no disc #2. So we waited all that time and couldn't even watch all of it because all the discs weren't there.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I am a big fan of the show. Great story!!!!!!!!! love this!!! Paid a great price and plan to watch it from the beginning again.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|The story was good, but reading the people's mundane thought processes was boring and tedious. This was my first book by Gillian Flynn, and I wouldn't read another one.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I absolutely love this movie!! Great stars and great acting. Funny funny funny. Cant wait to get part 2. EXICITING!!!!!!!
1401224792|5.0|This was an extension book. I thought it was a fun read. I like how they bring some history into the fairy tale.
B00D3LA5WG|2.0|i was a little disappointed with this movie. they showed all the good parts in the movie trailer on t. v. no excitment what so ever.i am sorry i bought this one.
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|This is a fun series to watch. The characters make you feel like you are really there. It is a bit dark so not good for children.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|It was a great purchase, got it used but it filled a few holes in my media player list.  glad I bought it...
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I've been searching for a new fantasy book to immerse myself in and came across this from amazon recommendations. From the first few pages I was hooked. The writing is tight and detailed. Storyline and world-building well paced and developed. I love series like WoT, Kingkiller Chronicles, Stormlight Archives etc... I do not like GoT (I don't get how it's so popular...). I love series that have elements of magic in them and this one definitely did - though somewhat introductory - seems like it'll develop more in the next book.  If you loved the first two books or Kingkiller Chronicles, I would recommend this.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I have to say I was very nervous about this movie especially being a huge fan of the book. While this movie didn't remain true to the book, Max Brooks zombies were slow and the war wasn't won by a miracle cure. I actually like the Movie, decent acting and the plot was decent. Lots of very good visuals.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|Let me start with the 3D because that's whats most important here. 3D was excellent!! why?? because they didnt try to use a bunch of crazy fly at your face affects...the 3D served the purpose of depth which was wonderful.<br /><br />The movie though....................was AWESOME. been wanting to watch this since the trailer, it was great. i really liked the story and the action.
B00640UICA|5.0|The first games are easy but it gtadually gets harder. I manage to get thru to the final 20 boards, but cannot get right to the end.Still trying but may have to give up.Excellent concept.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|been wanting this time piece for a while. excellent watch. can't believe i didnt already buy this.... movement is great and the time is accurate...i immediately put it on out of the box(of course after installing my clasp) and only took it off today to wear another new watch to work. now its back on and ready for me to use while drumming(haha that will keep the movement going for sure)
1781162646|5.0|I'm having trouble understanding the negative reviews.  It's a crime novel with a twist and it works in every sense.  I felt like I was reading old-school King (which is good-school King) just not in his trademark horror genre. Good for him and lucky for us he's always refused to be pinned down under one label (The Dark Tower series), etc.<br />Joyland is, excuse the pun, a roller coaster of fun. Crime mystery, a touch of horror, a bit of romance, summer jobs for college kids, bonfires on the beach, a great cast of characters and, most importantly, two \\"boys\\" on opposite ends of the childhood spectrum who become friends in spite of their differences.<br />Relax, enjoy the feel of of real book in your hands again and the crazy fun known as a Stephen King novel.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|this game is fun and funny! its also addicting. I love the little pudding guys. not too hard or too easy, my two year old likes watching me play so that is an extra bonus for me
0786856297|5.0|Bought this for upcoming 6th grade required reading. This book was in MINT condition !<br />Buying used books can sometimes be risky. This one, however, surpassed my expectations.<br />Thanks !!

B00BFUUMO8|3.0|It is fun to play. I like the fact that you can discover the different dinosaurs in a piece of Amber.
0143122061|5.0|If we don't know history we don't know what works and what doesn't. Our schools are so lacking in history today the only characters they know are Martin Luther King and Obama. Who was the first president of the United States? They answer: Martin Luther King.  What did Martin Luther King do? He was a president. It's appalling how the schools keep the kids dumb! It's easier to manipulate them when they are old enough to vote.
1845761502|5.0|Great book. I strongly recommend it. Stan Winston was a genius and his work talks for itself. Every movie fan should have this book.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|I got the device about a month ago and I use every day. Very conveniently. Indications rather exact. The charge of the battery suffices almost for a week. It is happy. I recommend.
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|This game is ok very similar too others games but i did enjoy playing it i wish the free games would allow you too replay them or that they had longer game play
B009VIZDLI|5.0|A compelling evolving story that was full of interest intrigue and fun throughout, a very enjoyable, hard to put down read, Fran
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It's good as long as you use Netflix or Youtube App from your phones. It doesn't support the Chrome Browser on the phone. The casting from the Chrome Browser through a laptop is not good either
B009KS4XRO|4.0|A game that is truly addictive, not new but has many interesting added gimmicks that add mush pleasure to play. Initially free, eventually you must pay to continue, if an addict,  worthwhile. Recommended for the gambling fraternity.
B00EB6ENXO|1.0|I thought you could download it but it looks like if you don't have Kindle or some other device it is not happening
B0051ANPZQ|3.0|I found an error in the book, on the chapter Olivia's Brother, there is a ton of capitalization errors, not capitalizing the beginnings of sentences, not capitalizing I or I'm or things like that, and not capitalizing names.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I've been a King fan for 30 years- and with this book, he really went back to his envelope pushing, make you squirm horror. Brilliant as always.
B001G0SRAI|5.0|All reviews here are gushing. Nothing to add. Devastatingly good. Own it or miss out.<br /><br />FYT is ridiculous. It is decades ahead of its time.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I Could not keep my eyes off the screen. The story tied together so well. Hats off to Loans Moriarty.
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|Fantastic game it's one if those games that you play anytime you want .. it came from the computer to my kindle fire so the experience us even better the only bad thing I would say is that when you get passed level 100 it lags a lot but other than that it's amazingly flawless
B002SSUQFG|2.0|The watch is smaller than I thought  how do I return it? Please let me know how that can be done.

B00B7Y0206|3.0|I do like this app. But every time I get on it, it won't let me search anything, it crashes, and takes so long to watch a video because it has to load. Please fix this!
B0048KXRR6|4.0|That Emma Thompson is not just a pretty face has been proven several times, among them as writer of the &#34;Nanny McPhee&#34; movies.  The original was a delight, and the &#34;Return&#34; is great, too.
B0021L8V0M|4.0|Great movie but leaves you with the expectation of a follow up.  Hope to see one sooner than later. .....
B009XTF8KQ|3.0|\\"The Exorcist\\" was a groundbreaking film. It wasn't just a fright fest. It had a strong socio-political subtext that gave it depth. Other than that, the only film involving possession to reach near the same level of quality is \\"The Conjuring.\\" All others, and there are quite a few, pale by comparison. \\"Possession\\" is no exception.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Clyde (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and Stephanie (Kyra Sedgwick) are recently divorced. He's trying to get back on the fast track as a basketball coach and she's starting up a business. Their two young girls are coping well enough with the situation. Dad takes them garage sale hunting where the younger daughter finds an antique box. She brings it to dad's new home and, little by little, she comes under the spell of said box. Now mom and dad need to get her released.<br /><br />This is kind of a sucky movie. I kept seeing things that I'd seen before. As in Spielberg's \\"Poltergeist\\" he situates dad's new house in a new subdivision. As in \\"The Exorcist\\" you're dealing with a broken family. As a matter of fact there were a few elements taken from \\"The Exorcist.\\" But this is just a sketch of a movie. There is little here with any resonance or lasting quality. There were a few good scares and a few good scenes. I like Jeffrey Dean Morgan and he's decent enough here. I like Kyra Sedgwick but her part is poorly written. I suppose the big surprise was seeing Yiddish rapper Matisyahu as the Jewish exorcist. It was shot well enough. The sound mixing was suspect and the directing was uneven. I've seen director Ole Bornedal's \\"I Am Dina\\" which I liked quite a bit. But he also directed \\"Nightwatch\\" which I hated more than I can say.<br /><br />Audiences love a good, scary movie. They love being scared without an actual threat, but chances are, unless you're young, or new to the genre, there won't be much to raise the hairs on your arms here.
B00AFEXRME|3.0|I was very dissappointed in the nudity of Washington's movie, Flight.  I usually like his films. Hope the next one is a little less R-rated

B003B02O0A|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  If you like Grisham, you'll love this one.  Story takes place among places and people Grisham knows well.
B003M70O5O|5.0|At first I was hesitant to watch the show.  I caught a couple shows in the middle of one of the more resent seasons and it was so hard core that I just change the channel.  So with a lot of my friends talking about the show.... I decided to start watching the show from the beginning!!!! Much to my delight it was easier to swallow slowly.  It builds up at a gradual pace.  Now I am hooked. I can't wait to see season 5 & 6!!!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I found this book to be simple and easy to read.  The author breaks down emotional needs into 5 categories that can be applied to any relationship.  Even if you believe you're relationship/marriage is fine, it will not hurt to ensure it stays that way.  Preventative maintenence is always a good thing.<br /><br />I recommend this for any marriage/relationship or single person thinking of starting a relationship.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Best film of 2013, so far. Pure entertainment and great special effects, I loved the art direction and set design very much indeed
B00E34A9FU|5.0|My opinion is this is the best live preformance that The Grateful Dead has been recorded.  Vocals are clear, music is perfect.  Beats 5/8/77
B008Y212PI|3.0|It's different type of puzzle game.  A number puzzle game like zudoku its fun non the less but not a 5 star f9r me

0307476073|4.0|I am 81% through my Kindle version of Wild and enjoying the trek, which was recommended to me by at least four readers of my own book. Having walked 800 miles of the Camino de Santiago over five years, I thought I knew long-distance hiking. Wrong. The PCT is not the Camino. And, Strayed must have feet of iron!<br /><br />The author vividly describes the long stretches of trail without civilization, the self-imposed isolation, the vast quiet and naked nature she met on the PCT. Descriptions of nagging hunger, growing dislike of dehydrated food, FEET . . . swollen, shedding toe nails, blistered raw by too small boots . . . weave me into her journey, grateful to be experiencing it only vicariously. I feel her fear when a fox is standing before her, when bears run ahead on the trail right where she needs to walk and rattlesnakes warn her not to invade their space, when ice she must cross slopes away into the abyss, when a promised water tank is empty. I see the pink and yellow of the sunset that enchants her. I hear the birds calling through her tent walls. And, I see signs that, by the end of the story, this journey may birth a transition from her darkness to a better place.<br /><br />But I am not going to hike the PCT myself. I'll continue to do my long distances on the Camino de Santiago, staying in towns each night, never lacking potable water or hot food, always within an hour or so another hiker if I stop and wait. The venues are different, but in some ways, the experience of challenging oneself and giving over your feet, heart, and spirit to the lessons of the trail resonate as similar.<br /><br />Wild is a good read. Enjoy the hike.<br /><br />Peg Rooney Hall, co-author of Second Wind on the Way of Saint James: A Novel
B008XG1X18|4.0|I looooove Pinterest but the app gets hung up a LOT. Also, will not let me choose my appropriate category to place a pin in. Gets frustrating quick!
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|Loved the series since season 1 but couldn't watch the marathon. Now i can have my own bb marathon anytime. Can't wait to get this. I'd pay more for it if i had to
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|A must see for Trek fans! The action never stops. If you are a lover of Si-Fi, you will love this movie!
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Nice app. Easy to use because you don't have to navigate between screens. It's all right there. You can have multiple cities programmed in the app as well.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I am an avid Grisham fan. There are very few of his books that I have not read.  This one does not disappoint.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|A good game that can be played and advanced with no cost and lots of fun. The challenges and puzzles are<br />part of the whole story. This is a fun, search &amp; find game
B009ZQI41C|5.0|Downton Abbey ranks among one of the best series I've ever seen. It has everything you could ask for in a phenomenal show. I found myself deeply engaged and connected with each character, and my fascination never receded. I wanted to watch ever episode but sometimes using Amazon Instant Video I would force myself to go a couple of days before starting the next (just to add a little suspense). I didn't think this show would be all that good, but upon reading and seeing such high reviews and ratings, I thought I must give it a try. Seasons 1 and 2 were magnificent and I couldn't wait to watch season 3. It too turned out to be another hit and didn't let up on the drama of Downton. But the ending was a sheer jolt. I was flabbergasted and highly disappointed with the way season 3 ended, and I mean the VERY end. Overall it was well worth the watch.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|I got what i expected from a bruce willis action adventure. story interesting enough to keep me intrigued and fun interactions
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game was easy to learn and yet it challenges your reasoning and logic as you play.  Its fun and relaxing.  I like that you can break and come back to it.
B00BMKDTNC|2.0|After reading 13 of the Wheel of time books I was anxious to complete the story. I realize that Robert Jordan had passed away and the conclusion was being penned by a different author, as were the 12th and 13th books. I had noticed the previous two were not as fluent as the others, but I expected to see a difference in the rhythm. The last book was a total disappointment. I could read only 3 or 4 pages before I would have to take a break from the heavy, depressing war scenes. I cannot believe that Mr. Jordan intended for the final book to be so depressing. I know it was a fight for humanity against the forces of evil, but it was too tiresome to the reader. There was never a respite.  Even at the conclusion, when the hero rode off into the distance and there should have been hope for the future, you were left depressed. The sun did not shine on the winners, or so it felt.<br /><br /> I was totally disappointed.
B00D5YNQWM|5.0|I am a big Aerosmith fan.  This is to add to my collection.  I watched it over and over again.  Thanks for everything and I hope to buy from you again soon.

B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Killing Floor is an excellent story.  However, I have an issue with the description of Jack Reacher.  He's 6 foot 5 inches.  I'm willing to bet Lee Child (the author) isn't 6 foot or taller.  I'm 6 foot 1 inch and I can tell you...I can't buy clothes to fit in just any store.  But Jack Reacher, who is 4 inches taller than me, apparently has no problem finding clothes to fit.  When I want to buy long sleeve shirts, I have to find them in a Tall size or they don't fit in the sleeves.  Also, I get sore knees, legs riding in buses, but Jack rides in them for long periods of time.  He also rides in several cars without complaints....there are several cars I can't fit into comfortably and that's just in the front seat....back seats are worse.  Then there isn't any comment about him having to duck to go through doorways...or the trouble he has sleeping in beds. I could go on, but one other issue really bothered me. In one scene he is looking in a mirror (at 6'1&#34; I have to bend a bit to look in any public mirrors) without any issue and then he gets choked by an assailant.  Sorry, most attackers will be smaller than him and have to reach up to choke Jack...that would make their grip fairly easy to break.  Except for the issue with Jack's size....it's an excellent book and I'm looking to read the rest of the series.
B005ES11VK|5.0|Extremely comfortable, durable, and easy to wash.  Walked several miles around the city and feet felt better than when I wear any other type of shoe.  I do not wear socks and they fit well - size matches my normal shoe size.  I wear them when i am doing chores around the house (dishes, yard work, carrying my son) and my feet, legs, and back are much less fatigued.  I have ordered a second pair as a back up.  Definitely recommend these shoes.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Super fun game! I play it everyday in my free time. They have many different challengages to keep you entertained.
0767802470|5.0|There really wasn't anything glamorous about the u-boat war in the atlantic ocean.  Although the german u-boats racked up very impressive numbers, and did the best they could to cut Britian's life line.  The constant spector of a terrible death was always a factor.  The u-boats were cramped, the living conditions were poor, and the longer the voyage lasted, the worse the conditions became for the crews.  I find quite amazing, that their morale and determination to carry out their missions, lasted so long.  It is a testimony to their courage and sense of duty, that they kept on going out in those metal coffins.  Eventually their cause came to ruin, but one cannot deny their courage.  Avery impressive film, well worth the price.  JRV
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|It is a pretty good game of hidden object. I just wish you could just play thru without having to build energy up after you play a few hidden object scenes your energy gets low then you have to wait a few hours on it to build up or buy more from the store and I refuse to buy energy for a game but it is challenging while getting to play. Having to buy energy is why I am giving it a three star.
0316204366|4.0|It says something about our culture that we feel the need to say that this book is \\"actually really good.\\" Of course it is, Malcolm Gladwell wrote it. He's a staff writer for the New Yorker and a former science reporter for the Washington Post. He is not some guru translating for gullible philistines. I'm not sure where all the resentment comes from, honestly. Malcolm is a great writer who writes books that provoke people to think. That is undeniably a good thing.<br /><br />But this book is great. Malcolm, four books in, has mastered his style, mastered the art of the story and the research and science behind it. This book is much less about studies and more about powerful individuals. From Wyatt Walker in the Civil Rights Movement to Emil Freireich and his battle to cure children's leukemia. Those stories are inspiring, provocative, counterintuitive and much appreciated.<br /><br />Couple quick notes:<br />-This book has more footnotes than I remember from Gladwell's other books. This is actually welcome and enjoyable. Some of the best stuff is there.<br />-This book is more applicable and practical than Outliers (which I felt just told us some information that there was little we could do with)<br />-It's a short, fast read. But I urge you to slow down and absorb it<br />-There is no big viral idea in this book (no tipping point or 10,000 hours theory). But in some ways that makes the book more enjoyable and make it resistant to implification<br />-Ignore the haters. If you like the book, great. You're allowed to. Don't let them bully you into denying it.

B00CC1K320|5.0|Very good,solid case. It adds some bulk and a small amount of weight but offers superb protection in a very stylish manner
B009ZQ8FQG|2.0|The show itself is great!  Watching it on my TV stinks.  Too many stops and starts!  Want to watch it on the big screen.  I do not like having to get out the laptop to watch it.
B0043D2L9S|3.0|I just received my belt and harness today.  I'm 6' 2\\" and the harness strap that attaches to the belt in back is not very long as stated.  It seems long enough but I haven't actually attached anything to this rig and taken it into the field.  However the XL belt that I got to go with it is very long.  I've got a 48\\" waist and I have a lot of slack in that belt.<br /><br />My problem is that I really needed a way to attach multiple cameras.  I wanted to hang a camera with a 500MM lens on the front and maybe a second camera with a wide angle while I carry my tripod and 800MM. I'm trying to photograph birds. I really don't want to change lenses in the field.<br /><br />After getting it I see just one way of attaching the camera with the camera strap fed through the loops on the shoulders of the harness.  This is hardly quick disconnect.  I actually thought the two straps attached to the harness that have snap links would allow me to attach the cameras in some way to the harness with a quick disconnect.  I normally don't use any strap on the camera because when I mount it on the tripod the wind blowing the strap causes the camera to move.<br /><br />So, I got a nice, well made harness and AGAIN have to come up with my own system of attaching crap to it.  I have to say I'm pretty disappointed.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved the book.  I too had wondered what happened to Danny Torrence after leaving the Overlook and eagerly anticipated finding out.  I was not one bit disappointed, but am a bit afraid to close my eyes tonight.  The book was well written.  I always appreciate that Stephen King doesn't dumb down the vocabulary.  How long will I ave to wait for another Stephen King masterpiece?
0399157565|5.0|The book was a very good read.  But Amazon took about a month to deliver the book to me.  By the time that it was delivered I had gotten a copy from by local library and finished it.  The Bone Bed now decorates a shelf in my library.
B0091CWYQ6|5.0|This product does what it is supposed to do, amplify the volume of your iPad or iPhone.  I use this frequently, and don't notice a change in the quality of the sound.  The extra base adds good depth, but does not block the treble.  The battery has great life to it.  I bought this due to no other good options to solve the volume problem, and based on good reviews on Amazon.  The good reviews were correct, and would recommend this product highly.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Enjoyed it. Great glimpse into the background, mind and spirit of one of mankind's greatest visionaries.  In most regards - what an ass - but I would have liked working with him.
1595827684|5.0|A must have for any fan of the series. Book contains many design insights on the characters as well as what makes up the mass effect universe.
B005NACYQU|5.0|Bizarre, engaging and fun! Neil Gaiman at his best with a trademark mix of fairy tail and humour. Really enjoyed it.
B00DNDR29I|3.0|The Electric Lady is a complex piece of music. Some of the songs were very upbeat and electric. A couple of the songs had me questioning whether she was talking to men or women. The music is very entertaining and easy going. The collaborations with Prince and Erika Badu are very good.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was a very interesting book. Recommend reading!!! Make you think about people's lives and how much we really know about our friends
B00EVCD9HY|5.0|This album is great, if you liked The ArchAndroid you will love this one.  Highly highly recommend it! Get it now.

0385743564|4.0|Definitely a solid, fun book by any standard.  As stated in my title, I feel it's far from his best work, but it's still absolutely worth a read, especially since the time investment is negligible.  Much has been said elsewhere about the \\"shocking twist\\" at the end.  Really, it's not terribly shocking at all, if you pay attention.  Honestly, I prefer twists of this nature, anyway, as they feel less like deus ex machina.  Anyway, don't expect to be surprised, but you can safely expect a fast, enjoyable romp.

AMAZON could of blew me off and said no, afterall its been 3 months since I bought it, I was really surprised when they emailed me saying they have shipped me a brand new watch of the same, and also sent me a shipping label to return the broken watch. this kind of customer care is getting very rare these days!! . I also want to say this, INVICTA makes quality timepieces, you can get a defect in anything, its not a perfect world,I have never had any problems with their watches so I havent had to talk to there customer service, I would hope that they are a stand up company as AMAZON is. My hats off to AMAZON !!  keep up the outstanding customer care. THANKYOU  AMAZON . FROM JH IN LA,  no not los angeles, LOWER ALABAMA  lol.

0753513382|3.0|For initiates who aren't familiar with how to construct an economic argument, this book is a wonderful intro. All too often I find myself having to explain to others really basic economic concepts in order to fully dissect their arguments, and for someone who doesn't have any background in economics this book could be a fun first step.<br /><br />There are some kernels here that caused me to reflect, but having decent familiarity with the principles of the author's thesis, reading felt a bit like reviewing a peer's book and not anything ground-breaking.<br /><br />The number of just-so stories is a bit hard to ignore. These are the \\"nice\\" arguments that don't have any rigor. They're generally examples of valid arguments, but without any data to support their premises they're not of much use. Further, the uninitiated reader might take them as truth without knowing to look for the gaps in the argumentation; if people could do that to Freakonomics, it will certainly happen here.<br /><br />I've loaned this book to a friend, so while it's not for me, I think it's good for someone.

B001DE29SS|4.0|\\"While not highly regarded as some biopics of a high measure, Chaplin tells the interesting stories of the great actor, comedian, director, writer, philanderer, satirist, and entrepreneur himself from his rags-to-riches story of living in poverty in industrial England to making it in America.<br /><br />The Chaplin biopic tends to focus much of its lens on his emotional complexities and social mishaps when he married and dated several women and having to deal with his work being the subject of controversy under a communist-fearing government and an anti-American, First World War-depressed British public and so much more. It almost makes you wonder the \\"left-wing\\" idea that having so much (money, fame, fortune) can often bring someone down if they are not careful. That axiom remains true and Robert Downey, Jr brings, even if American, a compelling persona to the legend himself and reminding that there was a uniquely human side to Chaplin than just the zaniness and slapstick he was known for.<br /><br />While not factually accurate 100%, the Anthony Hopkins side storyline which shows him during Chaplin's years of ailment and old age is compelling enough that the interview element of the narrative is effective and humorous on some lights to indicate how his timely arrogance pursued all those years. The humour is still prevalent here and is notable in the scenes where he starts filming his great works (with the fast shutter-speed slapstick) and the satire is indicated (but not very highly) with his controversial film, The Great Dictator (if only they could have mentioned more about M. Verdoux, the one that really made communist-fearing America hate him). While not all that relevant, parents might find the PG-13 rating in this film troubling because there is quite a bit of sight of the breast nudity here than found in another PG-13 black sheep like Titanic.<br /><br />While there is a lot to cover about this man, the film does not feel like it drags on much like the Capote film and the humour and novelty of his persona carries the film to a higher bar than I could have anticipated. Much like a recent film I've seen like this called The Artist (which focuses on a man's emotional journey in a transitional period from silent films to \\"talkies\\"), Chaplin does that and even more and could have easily been silent if it wanted to?\\"te film and the humour and novelty of his persona carries the film to a higher bar than I could have anticipated.

We loved trying to figure our where in the world the pictures were taken.  We also decided that it had many deep themes,  I think that it means that one must seek meaning in life where ever you are.  We watched the credits at the end of the movie which included a list of all of the locations that were filmed.  We also sat another hour and watched all of the special features, which included very interesting information about how and where this movie was made.  We LOVED IT, so much that we bought several more copies for friends.

B008JFUN6E|5.0|Im not going to hold anything back and I mean really Im not. This movie was so good and I mean so good that I had to see it twice the defintion of the movie was the bomb in the IMAX theater... man and it wasnt even necessary to see it with those goofy 3d glasses!!! But anyways the movie plot was pretty original a great diverse of actors from here the U.S., Mexico, Brazil, and South Africa so its pretty special knowing the consideration on what Bloomkamp had in mind on making this film and having a scifi flick that was part bilingual was great hell I dont even like scifi movies cause I always think that theres always going to be some nerds (no offense) that are always going to be slap fighting if one of them want to reenact scenes or something or even that the star wars or star trek were better films than \\"ahem\\" this one. But NO!!!!! This is my type of scifi flick that the slums of Los Angeles werent even made on some high tech computer but in on the outskirts area of the capitol of Mexico City which was pretty sad and hurts knowing that part of the film was filmed in one of the biggest dumpsites known to man. But again I appreciate the efforts of the film crew and actors that went through the time to film in the area but again it just shows on how theres such a imaginary line on where the rich and poor are geographically divided in this day and age is pretty disappointing. I know I went off topic here but with all seriousness the film means alot to me. I hope anyone who reads my review would consider watching the film to. Oh yeah another thing AVATAR aint got s--t what this film has!!!!!!!!!

B005FVNIW6|3.0|I enjoyed all the characters and thought they were well drawn and believable. I also liked following Ender's journey; watching him transform from the likable, intelligent child he was into the brilliant tactician and fearless commander of the Earth's combined forces.<br /><br />However, I don't know if I missed something, but I have to admit that I didn't understand the significance of the Battle School's battles being held in zero gravity. Okay, I know that it was an opportunity for leaders to hone and test their skills in strategy - but why did they have to do this in zero gravity? Of course this element added great pizzazz to the story, but I don't recall it ever being mentioned that soldiers would have to leave their spacecrafts and indulge in hand-to-hand combat although this is what the practice battles were all about. What I did enjoy in this section, however, as well as getting to know many of the characters, was the description of the computer game Ender plays, and how he discovers deeper levels of the game in parallel with his development. Clever.<br /><br />The sub-plot the author builds up featuring Ender's brother and sister is an ingenious inspiration, but although it comes to fruition it does so with a fizzle rather than the bang I was expecting and I was disappointed that, in my opinion, it falls short of its full potential. I'm afraid I felt the same way about the end of the book. After the twist concerning the final battle, Ender's initial reaction and then his discovery on the former colony world - what should have been a dynamic ending tying in the sub-plot - is a let down, partly because it packs a time span of many years into a couple of chapters with no further character development, exciting confrontations or hooks to keep the reader's interest.<br /><br />One of the most interesting aspects of this novel is Ender comparing himself with his evil older brother and I was looking forward to their being reunited and the resulting sharp verbal sparring that would result. But, sadly, this scene never comes, leaving the ending very flat. After a positive start I'm afraid I ended up feeling disappointed with this book.rring that would result.

1250029465|4.0|Bowen, James.  A Street Cat Named Bob<br /><br />James Bowen is a reformed drug-addict, a man on benefit who pulled himself up from the lowest echelon of society to become a minor celebrity via his publication of this book, his website and allied books about his adopted cat, Bob.<br /><br />This is a simple, honest and revealing tale with the `feel-good' factor that wins hearts.  I must admit I'm not usually won over by stories of innocence rewarded, but this book had me reading to the end - I finished it in one sitting of a couple of hours.  I put aside the fact that the story is obviously ghost-written and that somebody had jumped on the bandwagon when they first met and talked to the author, a lonely and desperate street musician.<br /><br />For those like me who habitually pass by on the other side of buskers and petitioners this book has somewhat softened my heart to the so-called down-and-outs. This is partly because James comes across as such an engaging and sociable fellow, one happy to help others, kind to animals and who has come of age, as it were, as a useful citizen after suffering the insults and indignities of being a beggar - although busking is no easy option and miles away from being a benefit addict.  I just might buy a copy of The Big Issue after reading this.<br /><br />But, as the title indicates, the real star of the show is the ginger cat Bob, who adopted James, rather than the other way round.  Bob gets lost, gets injured, flees from bully boys, but like Lassie in the end comes home to her guardian and friend for life.  James attributes his reincarnation to Bob the street cat, who first chose James, and then drew a host of admirers to put their hands in their pockets and drop a coin into the busker's guitar case.

B000KXZ8YU|5.0|This is an awesome book! Way better than \\"On the Road\\", which has been by now vastly over-hyped. \\"The Dharma Bums\\" does a much better job at jumping to the heart and soul of life, wherein the simple act of drinking some cool water after a hot hike seems like the single greatest experience ever had by a human being, not really, but the writing is tasty in such a way. This book is much more fun than \\"On the Road\\" and has much more heart. This is by far my favorite Kerouac book that I've read. This is one of my favorite books in general so I highly recommend it.

006117758X|5.0|Forget about delicately figured words, fattened by lavish butter and sweets, this is pure marrow, adrenochrome sucked from the still bleating jugular of some small animal resembling a Monty Phythonesque death bunny. This is the real raw deal from the late great Charles Bukowski, dirty old man of Hollywood, hobos and wine, king of the one room crusty paint palaces of the world. The writing is important. It comes to life and reveals that in the face of despair, shame, and defeat at the hands of a one-armed plastic robot that sometimes the only honorable thing to do is to just keep on doing. Life will beat you down, so what?

I was surprised at some of the final things that happened in Season seven, especially in regards to Brennan and Booth finally coming together and having a child. I did not know what to expect this season, but I was happily surprised to see that the writers did it again, delivering a solid series of episodes that keep you guessing and engaged. In this season Booth and Brennan continue to work on their relationship. On top of this the season also has some great mystery and intrigue that keep the show continuing for as long as is has. if you are looking for a series that has a little of everything, look no further than here!<br /><br />*I received a copy for review - all opinions are my own*

The story was fun and touching and has some great messages to share about family in general. I did not know what to expect from the movie as I did not see it in the theater but I have to say that now after seeing it here on Blu-ray, I wish that I had seen it on the big screen. One of the other things that I enjoyed was that the movie was still geared toward kids, and not specifically adults with kids as ancillary (as many cartoons are today). Overall, this was a great movie that all families should watch together and everyone in general should watch for the fun that it will provide and the smiles that will last long into the future!<br /><br />*I received this for review - all opinions are my own*

I was wondering in this season how they were going to continue on after some of the main characters graduated, but the writers did a great job and kept the plot moving on, not in a forced way in any sense. The plot in this season was compelling and made me want to continue watching from episode to episode which is exactly what I was hoping for when I started watching. All-in-all, whether you are a die-hard GLEE fan or only a semi-watching viewer, this was a great DVD set for another great season and I would definitely encourage all to watch!<br /><br />*I received a copy for review - all opinions are my own*
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Captivating!  Keeps you interested from the get-go. Couldn't put it down.  I will be giving this book to friends for a Christmas gift
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I have had a Kindle now for a year. This is a second one purchased for my wife. I am sure that she will be delighted to get this for Christmas. It's a present for her and we have not opened it yet. I brought it on sale and I can't wait to have her using the Kindle next to me in church, driving down the highway getting directions, going to the store shopping for food and clothing. Thanks Amazon.com.<br />Yours truly,<br />RTD - Richmond, VA
B009KG7EMC|5.0|The movie was funny and thrilling. We have the first one and enjoyed it so we bought the 2nd one and enjoyed it also.
B008YU7IGW|5.0|I choose this rating because the book is worth it is really good . It has a lot of affirmations that when you repeat it to yourself they are very powerful. Really love this book.
B00009AOBI|5.0|Great film and great stars in it. Enjoyed the director's cut. Had other parts than the one I had on VHS. Will watch it many times over.
B009VLXMJA|4.0|The girl got great vocals.  I'm not quite used to her going more Pop-ish and less country- that made me frown.
B00013RC8O|5.0|This movie is the original film and it was great. It is a great car film and enjoyed it very much.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I get the similarities to twilight but really... that doesn't make it horrible. Its actually a good story. Especially if you have the ability to have an unhealthy attachment in your own relationships LOL!! People are to quick to judge and just want to hate something so bad they don't just let themselves get lost in the story. I personally enjoyed it for what it was.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|A great movie to watch. Enjoyed it very much and loved everything about it.The movie is funny and very great.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I really enjoyed getting to know the characters in this town, Pride. It's the classic tale of a woman starting over in every sense of the word, and finding the man of her dreams. Throughout the story you are going for Megan to heal both mentally and physically and for her to accept Todd and the love he is offering. I can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I like how you always make the books so catchy I love all your books is you made another one could you put my name in it thanks<br />P.s. My name is Julia
B00F99EMRE|5.0|I expected the same as the old VT, with slightly clearer and slightly lower sound level. What I got was like a whole new album!<br /><br />First, the record is no longer \\"wall of sound pegging the meter 100% of the time\\" hot. Meaning you can actually listen to it all the way through without a headache due to ear fatigue.<br /><br />Second, the clarity is outstanding. Lots of nuances that were hidden now shine and give the music a new found texture and depth. Bass and drums benefit from this. A lot. The cymbals now sound like cymbals instead of a wash of noise.<br /><br />Third, there are a lot of tracks that must have been flat-out muted in the original. Such as the guitar solo (!!!) In Ceiling Unlimited. They are now brought to the front and become delightful surprises when listening and finding them in unexpected places.<br /><br />Overall, I love it. I always felt VT was a great album ruined by the production. Now it's free to shine as it should have in 2002.<br /><br />(now someone get someone to do the same to Metallica's \\"...And Justice for All\\" please!)
0762434279|1.0|Do not buy this little book or other books from this seller and author, I bought this book, it means nothing to me. Its contents do not give me any information about financial strategies. I was going to return, but it costs more money and times to return, so I decided to give to some kids to play with it. It is not worth of $5 or $6. Maybe worth of $.99<br /><br />I am thinking about reporting this seller to consumer protection agency.<br /><br />Several years back I had spent $500 to his seminar and taught me nothing, but charge every real estate on your credit cards.<br /><br />Please stop wasting your money. They collect $5 per person times 1,000,000 equal to $5,000,000 that is how seller and author will make money from you folks.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was perfection; Everything about it was simply beautiful. The characters are so easy to get attached to; I loved them all. I was very sad to see such a lovely book end. John Green 's writing simply could not be better.
B004YXE438|5.0|This is a real good puzzle game if you like puzzles. You can play this for hours without realizing it.
B009FXIICK|4.0|A quick fun puzzle game.  Exercises your mind.  Looks great on the Kindle Fired HD.  It has a couple modes of play to change things up from time to time.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|This doesn't compare in the least to other works by Sanderson. Elantris, Warbreaker, and The Stormlight Archive all stand head and shoulders above this book. Now this isn't meant to be a jab against the author or book. It's just that while reading this, you never quite grasp the sense of scale or depth of his other works. However on it's own this book is very good. I like the characters. From Codys nonsensical musings, to the main characters amusing inability to form decent metaphors. The characterization in this book was great. The plot was solid and moved along at a decent pace. The ending was satisfying. A huge part of the story is finding a way to bring down Steelheart. The way it's done doesn't feel cheap or like a copout, it is carthartic and about what you would expect. Had a great time reading this. Definitely recommend.
1439156816|5.0|A perfect book for those who like good stories and, of course, the art of writing! It's a most read for everybody who enjoy the craft and appreciate a good reading.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Cut the cord, get this and your phone or computer is your remote/cablebox.  just cast your apps or project free tv and bam you got everything you need. say goodbye cable co
B0026QC0TA|4.0|I enjoyed it; nothing spectacular but enjoyable anyway. Amazing cast but predictable story line. I'm glad I didn't pay money to see in theatre, but it's a good &#34;Saturday night/popcorn&#34; movie.
B001E9641K|5.0|We have all of the ticket to ride variants so far, with the exception of Africa and the forthcoming Netherlands.  When my wife and I decide to play TTR, this is almost always the one we choose.  Why is that?<br /><br />#1.  It plays pretty fast.  Granted we are experienced TTR players, but our last game was just 45 minutes from setup to teardown.<br />#2.  It presents fun challenges based on the map design.  No longer can you use wilds on colored or gray spaces.  They are only for spaces marked with the locomotive icon, and for tunnels.  Good news is you can now choose 2 wilds on your turn just like other colors.<br />#3.  A nine space route!  That's right, a nice space gray route.  It's worth 27 points alone, but you need 9 of a single color (no wilds to claim it).  A unique TTR challenge.<br /><br />The rules are slightly different than the regular TTR, both for picking cards/locomotives (as I mentioned above) and both tunnels and ferries are used.  These are concepts that have already been introduced in other TTR expansions, so if you've played them, then you already know how they work.<br /><br />If you get frustrated with too much player interaction and players fighting for train routes, then this isn't the map for you.  Stay with USA, Europe, or maybe Switzerland which presents many more options, and it's easier to avoid each other.<br /><br />If you like TTR two player, this is the map (followed closely by Switzerland).  You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />But it only plays up to three player.  Any more than that and you're out of luck.<br /><br />Definitely Recommend!  Doubly so for couples.
B00ECU56SK|5.0|I was interested but almost afraid to watch after reading the description.  I was afraid they were going to take it too far from the familiar and that I wouldn't like the direction.<br /><br />I gave it a chance and was won over within the first 20 to 30 minutes.  They successfully stretched themselves creatively without making it feel too unfamiliar.  Give it a shot, you will like it.
B008KYWN0S|4.0|Please take note of the color descriptions!  I was looking for a white ballet-flat style shoe and ordered these because they came up when I searched for \\"white.\\"  They even appear to be white in the picture, but I assure you that they are actually a very shiny, metallic silver.  It's my own fault for ordering hastily without noticing the name of the color was \\"silver,\\" but I just wanted to prevent someone else from making the same mistake.<br /><br />As for the shoes themselves... they were fine, no complaints really.  They fit me well, but I never really got to try them out because I had to return them due to the color.  On the plus side, the return process was simple, painless and free.  I just don't have a need for metallic silver shoes.
0735619670|2.0|Not really a book I was looking for. That is the only reason for two stars. Good book for advance knowledge.

0385528787|5.0|What elevates [[ASIN:0385721676 Oryx and Crake]] (Book One), [[ASIN:0307455475 The Year of the Flood]] (Book Two), and now [[ASIN:0385528787 MaddAddam: A Novel]] (Book Three) above almost all sci-fi (or, as Atwood prefers, speculative fiction) is her inventive language and storytelling, and her ability to intermix the human proclivity for excess with a construction of a plausible future built directly on what corporations, governments, and scientists are imaging or developing presently.  In the case of her trilogy, that is the exploration and manipulation of genes for profit, weaponry, and, in especially malicious or morally misguided hands, the eradication of humankind as we know it.<br /><br />In MADDADDAM, Atwood picks up the story after the BlyssPlus epidemic has wiped out nearly, but definitely not, all of humankind.  We remember that Crake in Book One, with a team of handpicked scientists, some of whom reappear in Book Three, created a new breed of hominoid attuned to nature and a sealed, protected environment for them, the Paradice dome or Egg.  Secretly, he also engineered a deadly virus, hid it in BlyssPlus (similar to [[ASIN:0060850523 Brave New World]]'s Soma), and, to use Craker mythology, cleansed the world for them of pesky competition.  In Book Three, along with a few other surprises, we learn that's not entirely true; there's more to the story.<br /><br />However, the world still contains humans, and of the worst sort, Painballers, trained in the pre-devastation world to kill for sport, men without souls who slaughter whatever they please, humans and animals, butchering and eating them.  Confronting and eliminating these killers forms the main storyline in Book Three, along with bringing together characters from Books One and Two and showing how they establish a community and look to the future.  If you've read the first two books, many of the characters will be familiar to you.  The main group in Book Three are Zeb, Toby, Jimmy (Snowman), and a new addition, Bluebeard, a Craker child, a beacon of hope.  As for the preceding books, Atwood supplies brief summaries of each as prologue to MADDADDAM, so even if you haven't read them you'll have a sense of what transpired.<br /><br />Much of MADDADDAM consists of flashbacks to the time before the destruction.  Atwood handles these in a most artful manner, having Toby, and later Bluebeard, relate them as a mythic belief system, a retelling in simplified words, pleasing to the Crakers.  Many of the flashbacks are remembrances by Zeb.  All serve to fill in and expand on the ground covered in Books One and Two, including Crake as a child, life in the Pleeblands, and the relationship of Zeb and Adam, Adam One, founder of God's Gardeners, and the boys' relationship with their father, founder of a debased version of Christianity, a mega church called PetrOleum, quite a nice invention on Atwood's part playing off the idea of the rock upon which Christ builds his church (Petros, ancient Greek for rock).  Taken together, the three volumes provide a complete, multi-sided view of the world in the years shortly before Crake's manufactured extinction event.<br /><br />Atwood casts a jaundiced eye on institutions.  In her world, government has succumbed to powerful global super corporations, CorpSeCorps, HelthWyzer, OrganInc Farms, and the like.  Packaged goods have been pushed to the extreme (SecretBurgers anyone?), animals gene spliced to meet market-created human needs (with plenty of unintended consequences, like thinking Pigoons), until there doesn't appear to be much of a natural world.  These corporations aren't above perpetuating any nefarious act to spice their bottom lines, including manufacturing a disease and then a patented cure for it.<br /><br />The current trend of wealth concentration in the hands of a few has reached its own extreme level in her world.  An elite group of educated technocrats reside and work in corporate compounds (ironically, company towns of oldre-imagined as posh conclaves), while the rest of the world battles it out in Pleebland.  It's a nasty world of struggle, of pornographic pursuits, of bloodletting sports, a society on the make.<br /><br />There's little solace or moral value in religion, either.  How could there be in a world where a major religion is the Church of PetrOleum, the motto of which could easily be that quaint 2008 political shriek, \\"Drill, baby, drill!\\"?<br /><br />But don't fear; Atwood doesn't preach.  She simply presents a world and human society dashed to hell by an overly enthusiastic quest for the good life, the life of materialistic depravity.  Highly recommended book and series.<br /><br />Also, if you haven't already, you'll want to pick up a copy of Atwood's masterful, insightful, and fearsome [[ASIN:038549081X The Handmaid's Tale]].  It is among her best and, in my opinion, ranks with the great dystopian novels that include BRAVE NEW WORLD and [[ASIN:0451524934 1984 (Signet Classics)]].re-imagined as posh conclaves), while the rest of the world battles it out in Pleebland.

B006LSZECO|4.0|This was the first of Gillian Flynn's books that I had read. I actually prefer her other two over this one but I love the double character perceptive she gives. I really love her writing and can't wait to read new releases from her!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great book!  The characters are very likable and relatable.  Once you are in to the story, it is hard to put the book down.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I loved the plot twists in this story. You don't get the perspective of different characters like in other Gillian Flynn books but this is still one of my favorites by her!

B00EP0KBXM|4.0|A lot of people who had seen &#34;After Earth&#34; made bad comments about this movie. It is true that Will Smith played a less active role this time around(every actor needs to stretch his talents). If you keep in mind that Will always puts a part of himself in all the characters he portrays & can wrap your head around the concept they are trying to envision in this movie, you will see that neither Will, nor his up and coming co-star & son, do not disappoint. I found the movie entertaining. It has heart.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I love it fut its a challange!!!but a fun and exiting one!<br />I just love dumb ways to die and the free video is alkward but cool
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|The film captures the comic hijinks of mutual assured destruction. It features outstanding performances by Peter Sellers, Sterling Hayden, George C. Scott, Slim Pickens, and James Earl Jones. The film is a funny, but cautionary tale, of the near futility in trying to micro-manage highly complex, close coupled systems. Dr. Strangelove makes a thought provoking companion piece to Seven Days in May or Fail-Safe.
B0000669JL|5.0|This albulm is great because it has most of Bob Marley's hit songs... I Listen to it every day but I wish it had ''Africa Unite, Kaya''

0375869026|5.0|I am actually reading this book with my son.  When I purchased it I thought it would be easier reading being that it is about a fifth grade student, however when it arrived I read the first chapter and became intrigued myself so I thought it would be something great for us to do together.  We haven't finished it yet but we love it so far.
1476727651|5.0|Somehow, with 36 years between the infamous story of Jack Torrance and the Overlook Hotel and today, Stephen King manages to tell a story in 'Doctor Sleep' that is both surprising and hauntingly familiar, like seeing an old childhood friend all grown up.<br /><br />A little confession time - I believe that 'The Shining' was my first Stephen King novel, and to this day it remains one of my favorites, of King's or any other author. I re-read it (with renewed pleasure) before reading 'Doctor Sleep,' and I found it hard to imagine a sequel that would do the original justice - even King himself seemed to shy away from the harsh, unforgiving tones and themes in 'The Shining' in his own adaptation of it to the small screen. But in 'Doctor Sleep' he finds it again, drawing me in as surely and inescapably as ever, introducing us first to a man caught in a downward spiral - a man we knew long ago as a frightened and powerful boy.<br /><br />Dan Torrance (once Danny) has not had an easy life. His \\"shining,\\" his psychic powers, haven't helped him forget the awful things he saw and felt in the Overlook, or the visits from vengeful spirits that continued to haunt him in later years. First, he tried to lock them away in his mind, and then he tried to drown them out with drink. As we are getting to know him again, he has hit rock bottom, with only a scant hope of finding his way out again. That hope comes in the form of a small town in New Hampshire, a few people who have faith in him, and most especially, a little girl whose own shine makes Dan's look like a mere glimmer. Against that hope is Dan's own human weakness, and a dark group known as the True Knot, come to steal a little girl's essence away.<br /><br />The story that unfolds in 'Doctor Sleep,' (which I will not retell) does the neat trick of following naturally from the events of 'The Shining' but taking an unexpected turn - a pleasant surprise. The tone and pacing of 'The Shining' were both unrelenting, and in that regard 'Doctor Sleep' does not disappoint. Taken on its own, this new novel is eminently readable, often gripping, and constantly hard to put down once you dive into its pages. Despite weighing in at over 500 pages, this is a book that I wanted to devour in big gulps - small nibbles just weren't enough.<br /><br />Perhaps 'The Shining' didn't need a sequel - I never felt that it did, anyway. But now that it has one, I find that 'Doctor Sleep' is another example of why I've been reading King's books for most of my life. There are ghosts in these pages that speak through the mouths of the dead, inhuman monsters wearing human skin, ordinary characters faced with extraordinary circumstances, hard realities and glimmers of hope. This may have not been a necessary sequel, but it is a worthy one, at last laying to rest the uneasy whispers of a tale told long ago.rd 'Doctor Sleep' does not disappoint.

B0091WNK8M|3.0|Language not good for young kids. Edited version would be fine. Also, when they made the movie, one of the kids talks to a reporter at the end about a giant squid, but the because the movie was too long it was edited out, so the directors should have edited out that part too, so now it doesn't make any sense.
B000EDWKXS|5.0|This film is among the better, and consequently, more memorable action films of the 1990s.  While some obvious creative liberties are taken with the source material, it still turned out as a solid film one can enjoy watching.  I could have done without Nicolas Cage's exagerated take on a southern accent (I think he watch \\"Forest Gump\\" too often) but I'll live.  John Malkovich was as awsome as he always when playing a diabolical villain...wonder how he feels about that type-casting.  Though some might call him \\"liberel\\" or something synonimus to that, I enjoyed John Cusack's portrayal of the intelligent and enviormentally-aware marshal...he had a good head on his shoulders throughout the film but let a certain amount of emotion slip through his professional facade at just the right moments.  The scenes in Las Vegas (real to a certain extent) were awsome and the film's soundtrack is addictive.  I'd reccomend this to any lover of action movies that still hang on to the value of casting and plot.

B00B8M4IMK|4.0|I bought and just received the Anker® 18W / 2.4A + 2.0A (3.6A max) Dual Port USB Car Charger.<br /><br />This is advertised as 1 Apple port and 1 Android port. I'm not an Apple user and wanted to use it to instead charge two Android devices.<br /><br />The good news is both my Nexus 7 2013 and my Galaxy Note 2 recognize this as an AC Charger on either port used! In the status it says Charging (AC). Excellent! It's also very small which is nice.<br /><br />EDIT: Just got back from a week long road trip using my Nexus 7 as a GPS and unfortunately the tablet will lose battery charge even when plugged into this charger. I tried both ports and got the same result, but one may have discharged slightly faster. It discharges quite slowly and could last a whole day of driving but it would be empty at the end. It IS possible that the USB connection can not supply as much current as the tablet uses while navigating and that it isn't this charger's fault but I never tried plugging the tablet in using its AC adapter and my power inverter. Would be a good test to run.

B003UBTX7C|5.0|Loved the whole series.  Each one better than the one before.  Hard to put down, though, once I got started.
B00AQTY3XA|5.0|Great story! Would recommend this movie to everyone. Very inspiring movie for all ages.<br />The filming and cast were perfect!
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Concise, easy to read account of what causes self sabotage and how to get over it. Clever, funny and extremely insightful.

B00DHHWXYY|4.0|It was well worth the price I paid. Have been so happy that I purchase this DVD when I did.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I could have done without the over use of the &#34;F&#34; word----which adds nothing to the story, but I liked the main characters and the plot held my interest to the very end.
B005HJ6MRO|5.0|A  real good App to  to  download and read  files  from your Kindle.  Works  with  Dropbox,  Google  Drive and Skydrive and  Western Digital  NAS  drives.  I would highly recommend  this  App
B007J4T2G8|5.0|When my best friend's told me about this book I scoffed at first. But when I finally got it last night...and began to read it...well needless to say...my boyfriend loved me and things got really fun. Thank you my Girls...I love you all
B0022Q8CSC|4.0|The Godfather novel and the masterpiece film by FF Coppola are part of American culture. A tale of family loyalties and revenge.
B00D4K8SBQ|5.0|A great little gadget worked so easily! My nephew had it, I borrowed it from him and it worked so well I bought my own.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a great book.  EVen though I thought I knew who was guilty, there were incredible twists and the book left you with so many ideas to think about.  What would I do in that situation, how would I react fi these events happened in my life.<br />Did I think the characters were right or wrong?  This book is great for a book discussion...it cannot help but generate conversation.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|she comes off as a spoiled rich girl who thinks she is the friend of the imprisoned and is not very interesting
B006LSZECO|4.0|I kept hearing about this book, but never had the chance to buy it. I got it for my birthday, and couldn't put it down. It grabs you from the beginning and takes you on a very thrilling ride. Twists, turns, and amazing shocks that make you ask yourself, \\"How did this author pull this off?\\" I gave it four stars though as I was very disappointed in the ending. I don't want to give anything away, but felt it should have ended a few chapters back. Otherwise, brilliant story, brilliant writer.
B008Y212PI|4.0|The FlipPix are in my top 3 of these type puzzles.  There are a few mechanic things that couldnbe better - larger grids and the ability to opt out of the mistake feature so you could guess more.  Got my first one free &amp; I've gone on to buy some newer releases.
0425263924|5.0|Thanks for being  so fast to get it to me I got it for my sister and she is very happy very good servals
0345803485|5.0|bought  because of my girlfriend, seems like the intended audience is for women but it works when we both read it
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I've played several runners and this one has by far the best graphics. The point system and suit upgrades are an excellent feature. Great job.
B00ELD3MUW|1.0|Had to remove app from my kindle fire after getter may strange message saying that I had seven bad phones on my system. Did not stop until removing the app.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a very addictive game .  Based on logic, the 5x5 puzzles are easy with each larger size puzzle getting harder.  Each puzzle unlocks a small picture which helps create a whole.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|The game is addictive.  However there are numerous versions so everyone is different and fun.  i am not bored yet!
B000FCK9CW|3.0|I actually enjoyed reading the book; the characters were interesting and I felt it was well-written.  However, I did not like the ending, which is the reason I gave it only 3 stars.  The ending was very unemotional, empty, and I was disappointed in the outcome.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I love the Sookie series.  However, the stories seem to have lost the &#34;umph&#34; that really engaged me in the series.  I read this is the last book and that brought down my rating even more.  I hope Ms. Harris reconsiders and comes back with some juicy content.  There are those of us loyal readers who look forward to her new books coming out and have faith in the series.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I really liked this game but it's a bit confusing for me since I've never played things like this before.  I've tried a few other of the G5 app's and I think they're all addictive so far....
B003O86FMW|4.0|I recommend this book if your interested and like this type of book.  Its not predictable and at certain points a page turner.
1595827684|3.0|I was excited to receive this book.  I was mainly interested in how they had designed the characters you play along with some explanation of how their designs progressed throughout the series.  I was pretty disappointed.  Each character might get one page with a large image of them and a bunch of tiny variations of their outfit.  A few characters get a bit more in depth treatment, but not the ones I really cared about.<br /><br />Take Liara, for instance.  The book is organized into three sections: ME1, ME2, and ME3.  In ME1, there's some generic info about asari, but nothing about Liara.  In ME2, there's nothing.  In ME3, they show her in her stupid outfit and say that they decided to do something different than what they did in ME1, even though they never show what she looked like in ME1.  No character progression.<br /><br />There are lots of location sketches, lots about accessories, but the characters are why I bought the book, and they don't get enough space in the book.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Very versatile and well designed. If yoour like me and your tablet is not on google play then this app. Is a life saver. One of the best I have used.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this book, I got hooked right away, first chapter.  The ending was incredible.  It was an 'if only' book.  I highly recommed this book for one and all.  It had a great message.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I loved it....don't like the cliff hanger at the end of the season though.  Can't wait for the next season to start
B002JVWR9U|5.0|The first season of a great show. It doesn't matter if you like vampires or not, you must watch it!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I had a great time wasting time playing this. It isn't too hard doesn't run out the timer too quick and would be good for all ages. I think the hints come up a little too quickly but that's a minor problem. Would definitely recommend.
0399226907|5.0|This book was bought for our daughter about 25 years ago and always loved by her.  Now we bought this book for our 2 year grandson who loves it just as much!  Recommended!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I read this book a few years ago when it was first published. These many year's later I've chosen it for a class assignment in diversity, looking at personality development. This is the best book for not only its entertainment value, but for a real-life snap shot of what it is like for a first-time, non-violent, novice who may find herself in a Federal prison CAMP emphasis on camp. My experience was EXACTLY like this one. The only difference was I was in Bryan, Texas and the facility was less depressing as far as aesthetics. But the inmate behavior and the staff corruption was the same. If your going in, know someone who is in, or your curious READ THIS BOOK!<br />P.S.<br />The show is good too
B00EIR5N9O|5.0|Trying to catch up on those &#34;books&#34; I missed over the years, I opted for this one from Virginia Woolf as a part of an online course.  What a delightful surprise!<br /><br />Woolf's style is innovative and requires the reader's attention.  Careful reading will introduce the reader to Woolf's philosophy so well written that the novel flows without interruption.  The book can be read on two levels: for pure reading enjoyment or as a text for deeper philosophical trends that became popular in the 20th century.<br /><br />KINDLE version:  Although I believe this book can be easily read on the Paperwhite --- my favorite KIndle for &#34;just reading&#34; --- I believe those who want to delve deeper into the philosophy would be better served by the Kindle Fire.  Additionally, there are pictures at the end of the book that show up well on the K-Fire HD.<br /><br />Formatting is excellent for the Kindle
B0084AXZK0|2.0|I know this book is a classic, but I can't see it. I can't feel it. The writing feels pompous and overly grand. Too many adjectives. Too many adverbs. I've tried reading it twice now, but I cannot get into it. Perhaps I must try again.
0811821846|5.0|While most of the recipes are geared towards a child's palate, these cleverly named recipes will charm any fan of Star Wars.  Great for collectors.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|I like the app, it's good for most things I want to do. Would be better if it had my watch list
B002XTBE6K|5.0|It took me several tries to get into the novel &#34;Emma,&#34; but once I did, I loved it.  I also love this version of Emma for all ages.  It's charming and, in my opinion, very close to the book.  The actors are perfect, and I like Ms. Garai's spunky, slightly modern portrayal of Emma because the character seems this way in the book to me.  Emma is a modern, for her time, young woman.  She isn't portrayed as having perfect manners even though she was brought learning them.  She is also repentant of her actions and grows from a spoiled child into a young woman.  I think we could all learn from her.
B0059XTV4Y|5.0|I was very surprised, since the reviews on this movie were terrible.  I am not a fan of Madonna, so to give it a 5 is a lot. The story was great, very original, had good twist, happy ending too.  If you love period movies, you will like this one.
B00991TCOG|5.0|If I had never heard this young lady's music before on both Pandora and YouTube, I would have guessed just by the cover that she was a somewhat uptight concert violinist, and I would be buying a dull series of violin favorites to cure my insomnia.<br /><br />Wrong!<br /><br />I can't just listen to one song at a time. I keep playing the whole album in my headphones while I'm walking down the street with a stupid grin on my face. When will there be another album?
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is an amazing movie for people of all ages.  I could watch it every day and NEVER get tired of it!

B00DR0PDNE|2.0|First, do count on the three months of netflix.  that expired quietly months ago.  Second, it's slow and choppy.  Or at least it was on my system (which I have not had problems in the past).  Anyway, this just does not really do anything that several other devices don't already do.  Might be worth it if it actually played videos from your computer like appleTV.<br /><br />Gave it two stars because it at least sets up easy.
B004JPJHME|5.0|A land-mark in drug cinema!! Everyone should own this film, Del-Toro (Gonzo) is classic!! If you've got Trainspotting, Spun..etc, or any Terry Gilliam movie your collection isn't complete without this film. A must have!!!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Beautiful sad story that I can't stop crying during the last few chapters.  It haunted me for days.  Highly recommended!
B00ADS98FC|2.0|I have seen the movie before and I love it  but this one keeps skipping and pausing and I haven't had this issue with amazon before

B00CEZJT2E|5.0|I really have put this thing to the test. Other products like Limeade can't shake a stick at Anker! I put this cable built in to the test as well & it hasn't failed yet. I have held onto this item after a couple months, but as a long time Anker fan I can't complain about their quality now or ever!

B001U0HBQ0|5.0|i enjoyed this movie in the past and when i moved i think it was lost. one night we looked for it and could not find it so i ended up buying this one in blu ray
B001CB8NQE|5.0|If you like Stargate SG-1 then you should also like this show as well. Very entertaining and characters are hilarious.
B003O86FMW|5.0|So many unexpected events, can nott wait to see the movie and read the last book! What an ending! Wow!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|A good app when on the go and still want to read, the app is still really good though it does have some flaws
B00ENYCQX8|2.0|I downloaded app to read free epub books from Gutenberg project on the Kindle Fire. The description made me think this app would allow me to do this. i was unable to open the book. i uninstalled the app
B00005B36H|5.0|Greatest album of all time, everyone should be required to listen to it at least once... Life changing music to say the least
B00AH69ZN0|3.0|This album is Metallica's best-selling album of all time, but in my opinion, not the best by any stretch. Songs like 'Nothing Else Matters' clutter up what should have been the next great metal album, and Metallica clearly softens their sound on this album as opposed to their 80's albums. I would recommend any of their first 4 studio albums over this one.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|The game is fun but kind of difficult. I love that it challenges you to think about the questions but when you get it its amazing!!!
B00AF82WTO|5.0|I love this version of the book. I was not disappointed at all and the actors portrayed the main characters marvelously.
B004M5HUXE|4.0|And quite hard for non-native speaker. All that fancy words! Interesting story and surprising understanding of a woman by male author.
B007PTJOV0|2.0|I play it on Kindle Fire. Even though it is 8.9 inch screen, still, not easy to control the game. It is Super Mario wanna-be. Cute. Easy. Just not easy to play on the tablet. Sorry.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This can is ridiculously addictive and sooooo much fun!!!!!!!! I work in a daycare and I have a four year old who is better than me! We have contests to see who can beat who
B0058VW36U|4.0|It is my 3-yr-old kid's #1 game at this moment. He says this game makes him to think a lot. :D Not only to time it right, but also to do it right. This game has everything. I know some of my friends are addicted to it.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I was really unaware of Chris Kyle until his unfortunate death. He is like so many others who have gone to war. A TRUE AMERICAN HERO who in the end put his family ahead of his military life and who left us way too soon<br /> I have now read the story about Chris Kyle plus both books of Marcus Luttell and their lives parallel each other.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I've used google search to reach youtube and do general searching. The youtube allowed me to view several chess videos which was very useful.

B0083SBJXS|5.0|Love love love this movie.  I'm a huge superhero fan and this does not disappoint.  Special effects are very well done
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is clear ,understandable.  I do not know what more I could ask. This to me is exactly what a bible is required to provide. The modern language is much easier to understand.
B0009QBLA8|5.0|I bought this movie because I love David Lynch. I knew it was a horror film but didn't think it would creep me out as much as it did. This movie is genuinely the epitome of where nightmares come from. The silence, the unexplained, the creature...all terrifying in their own right. If you love David Lynch or hell, even love monsters, you will not be disappointed.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|this cd kicks freakin ass i love it so much im so glad i bought this cd!!! ass n titties
B005HI4LMS|5.0|It's so silly but awesome. Very quotable and more complex than the other horror spoofs. A great buy and easy to watch again and again.
B008I43DYU|1.0|I am very disappointed for having no scientific skin.  Only three basic skins came with the download.  Basic skins do function correctly.
140006922X|5.0|Well written and researched, with copious endnotes and references and discussions in the back of book. Gave a lot of insight into the history of the period.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A real page turner, so much so, I read it on my iPhone! I strongly suggest everyone read it before seeing the movie.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I liked it. A nice distraction. I would have liked to see a bit more character development. But overall a good read.
B00D2CYU2W|4.0|Director Steven Soderbergh has crafted a lavish, freewheeling Liberace biopic with a pair of knockout performances by Michael Douglas and Matt Damon. Alternately dazzling and creepy, &#34;Behind the Candelabra&#34; looks like &#34;Sunset Boulevard&#34; in Technicolor. Special praise to Richard LaGravenese's detailed screenplay and a memorable supporting cast. Though among 2013's best films, hypocritical Hollywood deemed &#34;Behind the Candelabra&#34; unworthy of American theatrical release — hence its premiere on HBO. When considering the vast wasteland of junk-food cinema, Soderbergh and Company deserved much better.
B00DVKOYBM|3.0|I chose the mid range on this app because I like an app that is loaded and does not require you to be online to play??
B00F5FEZTC|5.0|This is one of Elton's best albums, though he has so many greats that it hardly does it justice! Once again, he has outdone himself. Very reminiscent of his earlier work like The Big Picture and Captain and the Kid. There is not a single track that I skip when I listen to this album on repeat! If you like Elton, you'll fall I'm love with him all over again! If you don't, this album will make you love him!
B00EL8JCGU|3.0|Walking Dead (which is excellent by the way) sparked this whole Zombie come back.  Zombies were never my favorite.  They are gross and generally decaying.  Replace Brad Pitt with another actor and I think this movie would have been a complete dump. Okay I like Brad.  There were parts of the movie that were okay, but in general long, drawn out and boring. Mireille Enos from (The Killing) is an excellent actor, but in this roll she was written in as this kinda mousy wife that pretty much just waits for Brad to come back to her and the kids in one piece.  Her holding the phone were some excellent scenes (being sarcastic).  She is capable of so much more, but just played a third or fourth or whatever rate actor to Brad.  It was his show and the zombies.  The computer generated kind.  There were just so darned many they could only have done it this way.  Okay.  Basically the story line was good, but it just took way to long to get there.  And then the likely hood of how to defeat them had to do with an enormous (let's say impossible) amount of luck.  Even for a movie the ending was just too much a hit and miss.  I don't want to ruin it, but if the odds in Vegas were that good, everyone would be a winner!
B00A83075M|4.0|very good funny animated movie, well done and the kids like it a whole lot, one of their favorite movies.
B0060D0R2C|5.0|I had watched this movie when it came out in 2006 and remember how much I enjoyed it.  So I purchased it so I would have it in my library.  Just love this Science Fiction thriller.  it keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.  Great story line.  One of those movies you could watch over and over again.
B000FC0OOU|4.0|A very intense tale of war and the local people involved in the cause fighting for their country however they can.
B002VX0A40|4.0|I have a few other lamaze toys and this one is one of her favorites. She loves the mirrored tail and chews on the tail constantly. We did however have to cut the ball off of it, she managed to hurt her eye swinging it around and I didn't want to chance her getting hurt again. Other than that we love it.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Thought provoking.  Opened my eyes to the futility of our prison system.  I have read other books by ex-cons and this was by far the best. I recommend this to anyone no matter the genre you typically enjoy.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I discovered The Piano Guys on public television.  Their music is intelligent, uplifting and unique.  Their videos are very enjoyable.  I'm very impressed with this talented group.  I have tickets to their upcoming Milwaukee concert, which sold out months ago.  If you have the opportunity, see them in person.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|His music is really GREAT!!!!!. After I listened to the CD rented Searching for Sugar Man. It is a story that will never happen again. He should have been the next Bob Dylan. His music fell between the cracks. Great story about him and his family.
B008RKGF1I|5.0|Forgot just how cheesy this movie really is...but I love it. The music is great. Story has a happy even though predictable ending. Classic 80's!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|A slamHaslam gives us an interesting and thought provoking view of JESUS, the Jewish zealot.  Haslam rightly insists that JESUS was limited to the Roman Judea for his formative experiences.  He rightly corrects the Paullne interpretation of  his life and replaces it with that of those who  ADE actually heard and understood JESUS.  Wonderful.
B00014X8KO|5.0|All 3 films were absolutely stunning<br /><br />If you haven't seen it I suggest you do<br /><br />The dvd came nice and fast in great condition
034580404X|5.0|My sister-in-law and co-worker suggested I read these books...........I am sooooo glad I did.  I have not read a book in about 10 years.  Read the first one in 2 days and was mad when it ended.  So glad I already had book 2 & 3 so that I could keep going.  Great books
0440422965|2.0|Nearly all the characters are completely awful to each other.  Luther's problem is spending the money but he refuses to even do the things that are free.  His wife is snooty and mean.  The neighbors, shop keepers and people collecting for charity are pushy and obnoxious.  It isn't until the very end of the book until people stop acting like jerks, except for the blatant racism that briefly rears it's ugly head.<br /><br />The writing itself isn't bad, but does get repetitious.  Sometimes it feels like he is padding the book, which is odd for something that is already so short.  If you really want to read it get it from the library and don't waste money buying it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The beginning of the book is confusing, then it starts getting better.  I hated the ending, that's why I only gave 4 stars,  but  overall very good.  I would definitely recommend.
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|Absolutely LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Michael Douglas deserved all the awards he got, plus did Mat Damon. I had the opportunity once  to actually see Liberace . This movie was so GOOD, shocking but so GOOD. I can't say enough good about this, watched it twice....going to watch it again today. LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005HEVBGG|5.0|I'm thrilled that one of my all time favorites (Jag & Dallas too) is available COMPLETE to prime members. The cost for prime upgrade wouldn't cover the cost to buy all of the seasons. After all these years, it's nice to watch (without commercials) sequencially.
B00915G6SU|5.0|Good quality. Nice storylines even though I was really sad to see a character die in one of the episodes
B0049J3QF4|5.0|I had my doubts about the story line; however, the movie ended on a great note.  Even my 5 year old daughter understood the message at the end.  Great family movie!
B0002TT36G|4.0|As I'm writing this, I'm ordering two more albums. Great product. Fits all my trading cards very well, especially if you team them up with the ultra pros 9 pocket sleeves as well. I bought these and the Ultra Pro 9-Pockets to refresh my archive of old trading cards. It's been over a decade and it was time to re-archive, as some of the sleeves had some damage over time.
B005SAP45I|5.0|With a three year old boy that loves Cars in general and then have Cars 2, he's in heaven!  Child friendly and definitely a great movie for the family with a good message.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book kept me on my toes all the way through trying to solve the case. Very good reading as expected from Grisham.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|But it's not bad.<br /><br />Once Google opens it up a bit, I'm sure I'll enjoy it more. They are limiting it's functionality presently, which is it's biggest flaw.

B00003CXDD|5.0|Very happy with this film it took a long time to find it.  Wish Ron Howard had made more pictures like this.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Clint Eastwood has acted in many memorable movies and every time does an excellent job of portraying his character. He is at his best in his portrayal of Walt Kowalski in \\"Gran Torino.\\" Walt is a grumpy, snarly Korean War vet who has just lost his wife. (The movie begins at his wife's funeral, where we get our first glimpse of Walt's acerbic temperament.) A longtime resident of a blue-collar Detroit neighborhood, Walt is upset at its changing character. A onetime white neighborhood, its residents are now mostly the Hmong people, who, as one of them explains to Walt, were strong allies of the United States in their fight against the Vietcong during the Vietnam War. When the movie begins, Walt has nothing but contempt for these people, including the extended family that lives next door.<br /><br />Over time, and as a result of a variety of encounters, Walt's attitude changes. We see him protecting a Hmong girl from a couple hoodlums, thus winning her gratitude and that of her family. He also befriends a teenage Hmong boy, who wants to go straight but who is being pressured to join a Hmong gang. In the end, he lays down his life for this family that at one time he counted as his enemies but are now truly his friends.<br /><br />Although \\"Gran Torino\\" has its moments of violence, none of it is gratuitous. Its message of redemption is unmistakable, and, along with Clint Eastwood's acting and directing, makes the movie worth watching.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Its amazing think temple run but add minions instead! I love it! A great way to test my hand eye skills.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|This book is like Cornwells first books.  Not to much Lucy and the ever changing partner stuff.  Not mushy or whiny.

B008Y212PI|5.0|Fun game. keeps your brain occupied. Needs more levels but overall it's very interesting. Please add more levels. Some puzzles can be challenging but that's that's the point
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I love this movie! The story line is sad but this is what happen in France at that time of the century!!! Great music!!!
B004H4XI5O|5.0|While not a self help book, it is a masterfully told tale of the author's research on and involvement with memory improvement techniques that inspires one to go out and get the right books.<br /><br />Recommended!
B007EC27QM|5.0|Love the large display.  Perfect for my old eyes and brain.  I use it to calculate the number of stitches per inch, increases &amp; decreases, etc. for my knitting projects.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Good time waster.  Puzzles vary in difficulty and some really make you think.  Definitely worth a try especially as the free app of the day.
B00ABLJ5NQ|2.0|Tow dimensional characters , the fantasy world very simplistic and not to inventive. Borderline boring.<br />The only reason I read to to the end was Gaiman. I expected a twist , a novelty , which did not happen.
B00BEIYP1W|5.0|I grew up watching Formula 1 but too late to see James Hunt and Niki Lauda fight it out.  Doesn't matter because this story was always going to get my attention.  In fact rarely have I looked to forward to a film.  I was not disappointed.<br /><br />I won't go through the premise here.  If you're reading this I expect you already know it.  I will say that this film travels at a pace akin to the cars it features.  There's not a moment to get bored or for the mind to wander.  To the contrary.  I wanted every scene to be longer, I wanted to spend more time with these people.  I was hungry to know them, flaws and all.  This is no glossed up little package of hero-worship.  Both Hunt and Lauda are as selfish and spiteful as they are inspiring and talented.<br /><br />The music is brooding, compelling and exciting by turn.  The camera work is intimate and amazing.  (You see through Niki's bury eyes, you see from inside helmets and from under and along the cars.  You see every shudder they make.  You see eyelashes and pores and ruined skin as well as stunning scenery.  You struggle to see through the rain.  You see through the flames, you see and hear what Lauda saw and head in that fiery minute (and sit glad you can't feel it).<br /><br />I wasn't sure how I'd take the most confronting action, the crash and the painful hospital scenes and I admit going into it a little apprehensive.  They aren't easy watching but neither are they overdone.  It's all very matter-of-fact. Horrible but nothing that can't be pushed through.  Not lingered on, not brushed over and I was glad for it. It had to be done that way to understand what Lauda actually overcame.<br /><br />While the race action was outstanding the best part, of course, was the interaction between Hunt and Lauda.  Every scene between them was charged (and in my opinion mostly too brief).  I could have watched those two talking for the whole running time.  Their dynamic is fascinating, the place they played in each others lives and careers slowly unfolds as you come to know them both and understand that each would likely have been something a little less without the other.  Despite people comparing them to Prost and Senna almost incessantly, by the end they reminded me much more of Senna and Berger, one serious and driven, the other understanding the vital importance of adding a little fun.  Both pairs added a similar balance to each others existence.<br /><br />Bruhl and Hemsworth are pitch perfect (as are everyone involved).  I wasn't surprised on Bruhl's front but it's hard to get from the preview the depth that Hemsworth would have to work with.  Happily he found those depths and plundered them.  There is so much more to his Hunt than a womanising baffoon, as their should be.  This is a key role for both actors but especially to showcase the serious acting skill that Hemsworth hasn't had so much of a chance to display.  The preview actually hinted at a more one dimensional take but it was good to see the serious side of James and Niki's little sparks of humour and delight too (played to perfection).  I ended up caring a great deal for these characters, warts and all.  This is one film I would line up to get an extended edition of but it also sparked my interested in finding out more about these characters.  It's not a documentary, things have been changed, Hunt and Lauda have been polarised a but more than they were in reality, but it's still damn good fun and has real history to depart as well.<br /><br />Of course the final recommendation is the most important.  Niki Lauda himself was very pleased with the outcome.  That is good enough for me.lives and careers slowly unfolds as you come to know them both and understand that each would likely have been something a little less without the other.

B003CH9PTU|5.0|Very dark but with very clever writing and characterization.  I know we're late getting started on the series but I have a feeling we'll be blasting through them!
B00005JLKB|4.0|I love Smallville. I really do. However, the first season doesn't hold up entirely well. The corny love triangles and freak-of-the-weak formula make this show feel pretty bad at times. However, it's always entertaining in a guilty pleasure sort of way. The series does get a lot better, though, and if you like Superman, I'd say it's worth a look.
B0000028RR|5.0|Personally I think it's the best one they've done.  If you're into Rage Against The Machine then definitely get it!
193700788X|1.0|I was just about to purchase this novel and couldn't wait to read it. After reading the overwhelmingly pessimistic and negative comments there is no way I'm going to even part with so much money for this clearly disappointing conclusion to the series. I'm really surprised as it's the most expensive of all the books too! What a shame!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love this app.  it does exactly what it is set out to do, and that is tell time.<br />It has cooler looking features in the paid version. However, the free version will due.
B00EP0KYDO|4.0|Great Story....Loved the Action. The smith Family have it all. Can't wait for the next project. Great acting and talent.
B008X9Z37A|1.0|This cover was so cheap looking it wasn't worth the $10 and when I sent it back and postage was deducted from refund, I would have been better off keeping the cover and using it for something else.  I would not trust this item to protect my Fire.
1938469003|5.0|This is the book to have for IPA lovers, very informative, great read.  I had a hard time putting it down.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I loved it so much then all of a sudden…BAM!!!! It's done! I'm so upset. And now I'm not so sure I want America to end up with Maxon but with Aspen. Also king Clarkson isn't all what he seems to be. I really wish it would've lasted a bit longer
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Our alarm clock at home died and we needed a a simple alarm clock to get us until the next day.  Bought this and never did go buy an actual alarm clock.  Only downside is keeping Kindle Fire always battery charged.  We really find this app useful.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Beautifully and uniquely written. The characters are well developed and multidimensional. Though the outcome of some of the  subplots are predictable, the story is told in such a way that it never loses its hold on the reader.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|This is the best Backgammon app.  Never crashed on me for 100's of games played on my Galaxy S4.  I have to play it daily.
159463176X|4.0|A story spanning decades, this novel is, once again, a well-written and intriguing tale by Hosseini. Its realism and twists won't let you put it down.
B004G600A4|5.0|Great entertaining princess movie.
B006WZLCZ4|5.0|Ordered for my grandkids. Looking forward to them playing with them with kitchen set. Sturdy and durable. Got idea from dasuhter-inl-law.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is so easy to use and to read. Thank you for having this as a free app. This is my go to app when I am in my tax class.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It was great. The packaging was perfect and timely. I couldn't have asked for more. It was great great great..
B00DJZR46G|5.0|Have always loved Elton John and had almost all his albums in the 70's,<br />Now I can have some fun replacing them with cd's,<br />Love to Elton; he's still standing.
B0033B5XCS|5.0|Bought this on impulse, and I could not be happier.  Really took me back to being a kid again...(neglectful parents).  Loved these movies and loved the collection. Great price for the collection.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to use. Great for quick reference.  I especially enjoy being able to explore different versions of the bible and listening to the audible sections. My favorite is the NLT.
B002EMESSM|4.0|This is a decent movie and was the first major motion picture for the Trek franchise.  The opening scenes are probably the best part of the movie for action, but the overall story line is good.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Tons of stuff to do, almost all is free. You can't go wrong with this addicting game, download now people!
B003B02O7I|5.0|He keeps one wondering unitl  the end. Some of his books are better than others, but this is a good one.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Has a lot of things going on in the game to keep it interesting, but sometimes it a bit glitchy.  The timers and counts are glitchy.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|has to be one of the funniest movies i have seen in a long time. not kid appropriate but funny
B007VUA7VO|1.0|Didn't really do much. And I know for a fact during calibration my phone uses more battery than what it said.
B00C7AXJMW|5.0|One gets so caught up in her narrative and attached to the characters that it is only after I finished it that I realized how brilliantly she's prophesized the apocalypse. People will indeed be the engineers of our own demise. Read it. Think about it. Then be the change we need to steer the future away from her prescient and informed predictions.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|The sound quality on this track is great, and I love the high energy of this song! This was a great buy.
6305546789|5.0|It was delivered very fast. My grandson was so excited to receive this DVD.It arrived in excellent condition!! I'm sure it will get a lot of use til Halloween !
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|I admit I'm pretty biased since I think practically everything DT has released is outstanding.  But I do think the 5 stars are truly warranted here.  Everybody brought their A game:<br /><br />1. I've always thought James was a terrific singer but this performance is simply a marvel.  Finesse + power = pure awesomeness<br />2. Mike on the kit puts on a clinic<br />3. Somehow, John actually raised the level of his playing on this album.  He is on fire.<br />4. James can finally be heard in the mix!  And he's killin it.<br />5. Jordan is reliably amazing<br /><br />Between the level of musicianship, the song craft, the power of the rockers and the beauty of the ballads, this album is truly exceptional.  And as people have already noted, Illumination Theory is a masterpiece of prog.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This book was written poorly. I really don't recommend it unless you're into flat characters, dull story lines<br /><br /> and the same dialogue repeated over and over again.
1451673442|5.0|I think that The Magic is a wonderful book because I was able to relate to it on many levels, so I am giving it my highest rating. I especially enjoyed the CD version of this book (which I hear regularly) because it offers constant reminders of the power of the Law of Attraction and the immense power of gratitude. After reading this book I started being thankful for all the things I have in my life; as a result, more good things have come my way. Through this book I am reminded to take the time to be thankful for everything in my life, from my paycheck to the car I drive and the friends I enjoy spending time with. I know the power of the Law of Attraction firsthand because I have won two big lottery prizes through the power of intentional creation. I would definitely suggest this book to all my friends. Review written by Eddie Coronado, author of the Kindle book \\"Manifest Your Millions: A Lottery Winner Shares his Law of Attraction Secrets\\"
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Excellent product. Very good quality, strongly recommended. It's like have a smart tv in your own house. Like it a lot!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I liked it.  difficult starting out but got easier once I got the hang of it. kept my brain occupied.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The game is really fun to play with others, but does tend to lag a bit. The updates happen just about once every month(in case you were wondering), and can be found on the minecraft wiki. Still I can understand the urgency for updates. Can't wait for Redstone.
0439023513|5.0|For being a used book it was in excellent condition. Looks brand new. From now on I will look into buying used books more often, they are definitely a better value.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Sometimes the open squares can't be determined; you just have to guess which square to click. The pictures are rewarding,the music is very pleasant, and the game is relaxing.
0439023483|5.0|I bought this book used from the seller. When receiving the book I had low expectations on the condition of the book. Upon receiving the book it was in almost PERFECT CONDITION. With the exception of a little shelf wear, I would never had known that this book was used at all!!!! Very happy with the overall outcome of the purchase.
B007IK44CK|5.0|nice fmile and i like it. the excellent computer fiction and exciting action .i like impossible mission series  and always support it
0439023491|5.0|I bought this book used from the seller. When receiving the book I had low expectations on the condition of the book. Upon receiving the book it was in almost PERFECT CONDITION.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|A fantastic tome chronicling the life of Steve Jobs, a man who forever changed our modern lives. An authentic look at his life and life's work.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Would not open. . . Just a blank screen for so long, just closed it! Even free, this was not a bargain. No thanks
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|Been enjoying her EP for months and looking forward to her LP ... this did not disappoint! you can call her queen bee.
B00E0SX118|3.0|Cute and funny. I liked that it wasn't a pretty princess story and it actually had some heart and wit to it. Great artwork too. Glad I bought it.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|this Star Trek met and exceded all expectations.  Good story line, great editing, photograpy.  Plan on buying the next one that is released.
B000YAA68C|5.0|Great purchase ! I love this movie and have watched it many times! I love a good romance ! Even if it makes me cry, that means it was worth watching.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A great combo of poignancy, humor, worry, fear, and made me really think about what I would do in place of each character.  I love books that make me dig deep.
B000000OQ5|5.0|My moms favorite group to listen to was Tesla when I was growing up. I bought this cd for her to bring back good times and good memories. She loved it especially since she wore out the cassette when she had it!
B00001OH7T|4.0|Just to avoid any confusion, the version of this CD that I have was release by Virgin Records America and is dated 1999. It contains 8 tracks ranging in length from 4:15 to 6:30. There are no bonus tracks, but the included 6 page booklet has lots of photos, credits for the musicians who played on the album, and the lyrics for each song.<br /> This was the first effort from Bowie's \\"plastic soul\\" period - where he transformed American Soul and R&B music into something a little more European (but still uniquely his own). \\"Young Americans\\" and \\"Fame\\" (which John Lennon performed on and co-wrote) are top notch performances and both did quite well - garnering much airtime on radio. Also worth more than a single listen are \\"Win\\" and \\"Somebody Up There Likes Me\\". \\"Fascination\\", \\"Right\\", and \\"Can You Hear Me\\", don't quite measure up to the others, but aren't that bad. Then there is an unfortunate re-working of the Beatles' \\"Across The Universe\\". It isn't as bad as what he did with The Rolling Stones' \\"Let's Spend The Night Together\\", but seems out of place here. I just didn't care for his shouting the word \\"nothing\\" repeatedly near the end of the track. I don't know what he was thinking there, but then I rarely know what David is thinking. In any case, it's not bad enough to keep you from enjoying the other tracks on this CD. This was a good first effort for his new performance persona, but personally I prefer the Station to Station album from this period in his career.
157330087X|5.0|the collection of guitar slingers in this dvd is amazing.  they should do it once a year.  i know stevie is gone but great to see tributes made to the greatest of all time.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|Easy to use, easy to undo (problem I've found in other games).  It's easy to move the pieces and customizable enough to get the playing experience you want.
B004JMY312|5.0|This movie came out when my girlfriend and I were younger and its been a seanonal classic since.<br />Thanks for hosting it!
B00CDT41RY|3.0|The acting and settings are admirable but the violence is too excessively displayed. It seems that director has emphasized again what he likes most; murder. It would have been more respectable if the killing wasn't emphasized so much. The bounty hunters kill and they get paid. What else would you expect from this film?
B000JIHP88|4.0|Bigger and heavier than I thought . Music is pleasant and sound too. However it was not exactly what I expected
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Loved this movie. I'm a big Marvel comic fan and the actors must be too. They did a fantastic job making some of my favorite comic book heroes come to life!
140006922X|3.0|Actually, I have not completed the book. I started but. Found  it so boring I put it down . I will finish it eventually .
0545123267|5.0|I loved this story.  Always looking for YA books to read, potential gifts for my 11 yo who is an avid reader.  This review is from a parental POV.  My daughter is almost 12, and I would let her read this.  It is a good story throughout, no slow points as many YA stories seem to have.  The book is \\"clean\\" for the most part.  Only small amount of questionable material (risque), and maybe a small amount of cursing that I really didn't notice.<br />The characters are likeable and realistic, they do not come off as \\"giddy teens\\" or \\"spoiled\\" as many books portray teens.<br />I enjoy vampire/supernatural from time to time.  If you don't then this is not for you.
1451648537|5.0|He was different and highly intelligent ! I bought an iPad because I was o impressed with Steve Jobs and his perfectionism. I had never owned a computer but after reading the book decided to invest .
B00EXVZZE8|5.0|OMG I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH!!!!! ITS MY FAVORITE NYAN CAT GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED!!!! XD XD XD TOTALLY WORTH IT!!!! BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!........YA!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Great and easy read!!! Cried my little eyes out while reading this on the train.  The characters and storyline are great.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Ok, when you can stream Top Gear in 1080p to a 42&#34; flatpanel TV, from youtube, over a DSL fed wireless network and the picture is mostly perfectly clear, you know you have a fantastic product.  Love this thing.  After that initial testing with Top Gear I set it up for a friend so she could cast some foreign shows to her TV (that are not available on things like the Roku). She was near in tears with happiness that she and her mom could now watch shows on their big TV and not just on the small computer monitor (90 year old mom never even bothered with the computer).  Will order one for me to have around just in case.  Additionally, I was also able to cast documents, .mp3 and .mp4 to my TV by entering the file path in Chrome's address bar.  So, it's not just limited to the internet.
B0026772N8|5.0|I've read this book about 6 times and it's great to be able to search for the memorable places and quotes without thumbing through the pages.
0439023513|5.0|It was in great shape. Great value. Will do it again.  The book was just as if I bought it new from the book store.
0802130208|5.0|Simply A &#34;Must Read&#34; My Friends...He was awarded the pulitzer prize posthumously...The stage is set in one of my favorite cities, New Orleans, the Quarter, and riotous situations throughout!<br />A True American Icon...
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is the most enjoyable Grisham in a long while.  Entertaining with twists and plots you don't see coming.  Bravo!
B002ZG98UK|2.0|Great movie and good quality. I would recommend the supplier and the movie but don't get too excited able 3D effects as they aren't great.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|First off, I must admit that I am far beyond my teen years and, for some, that may explain \\"it\\" (my discordant review). Having never read any of Suzanne Collins's works, I had no expectations as to her literary prowess, style, or, if it exists, the purpose (apart from mercenary considerations) of her writings. I chose to read Hunger Games (Kindle edition) because many independent sources liken it to Harry Potter, which I thoroughly enjoyed (the books, not the movies). Indeed, an oft repeated refrain is, \\"If you liked Harry Potter, you'll love Hunger Games.\\" Really? You be the judge . . . .<br /><br />For those with limited time and patience, I will summarize my review, now, by saying that I believe Hunger Games to be a vacuous story expressly written to a vacuous (ergo, undiscriminating) audience. If one reads some of the negative reviews, one finds the question (in various forms), \\"What is there about Hunger Games that teens find awesome?\\" The unequivocal answer is that which applies to the appeal of today's entertainment media: action, special effects, but no story! I think it safe to say that teens are more excitable than they are pensive, more superficial than introspective, and more easily entertained than challenged - and that may explain the popularity of Hunger Games. It is precisely akin to first person shooter games: you blow things up, kill the survivors, and move on to the next level with the profound observation, \\"Whew, that was close!\\"<br /><br />Hunger Games is written in the first person point of view, i.e., EVERYTHING that happens is seen from Katniss's viewpoint. The problem that issues from this POV in Hunger Games is, essentially, that there is no development of any other character because one cannot get into their heads - other than what Katniss allows; unfortunately, being rather self-absorbed, she does not allow for much and one is left with a teen autobiography that could have been exhausted in one chapter. As in first person shooter games, other characters are, for the most, to be spared or killed and what, if anything, they think, say, or feel is beside the point.<br /><br />It should be no surprise that Hunger Games progresses slowly because it is bereft of a captivating or interesting story: one blows things up, kills the survivors and moves on to the next challenge - the interim between challenges being filled with uninteresting reminisces or asides that are non sequiturs, at best. I dare say most people (teens) could read only the \\"action\\" sequences, skip the rest, and finish the book having missed nothing - all in one chapter.<br /><br />Interestingly, as reviewer Alex pointed out, you know that Katniss is going to survive the games because (1) she had to survive to tell the story and, (2) she has to be around to relate the sequel. Here one might point out that the same is true for Harry Potter. Yes . . . but, in the Sorcerer's Stone, one is not told in the first chapter that, in the events that immediately follow, only one will survive - a theme that, coincidently, J.K. Rowling artfully develops over the course of seven volumes.<br /><br />Finally, I share the observation and, indeed, the concern of others, that Hunger Games lacks a moral definitive or imperative; more than one chapter of kill or be killed in the abstract gnaws at the fibers of my core, which I find intolerable. As I stated, however, that is precisely what first person shooter games are about - and nothing more. Life is inconsequential.<br /><br />I found nothing in Hunger Games akin to Harry Potter; indeed, I found nothing at all redeeming in Hunger Games. Perhaps I was too distracted: while reading Hunger Games, all I could think about was The Predator.<br /><br />Ed
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I now have this app on my Lg Optimus One but it seems it will not go on my KOBO VOX tablet, after your update Oct 1, 2013. It stopped working! Please fix
B00006AG5N|5.0|30 of some of the best of his songs. I play this over and over on sterio and my mp3
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|This book is a fun read. The characters are interesting. Loved the plot. Sometimes too trivial but I still enjpyed it.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I liked the tone in which it was written, although I didn't love reading everything it said. I have been following the auto-immune protocol for about 2.5 weeks and while I'm not claiming any physical miracles (yet), I will say that I'm shocked, pleased, amazed at the way I feel mentally, at least regarding food. I am doing this solely to try and clear up chronic pain of over 3 years. I'm still having pain but have reaped some other benefits<br />For example: I lost 10 pounds in about the first 10 days, which has made it easier for me to do the things I love even with the pain. I have not eaten any ice cream or chocolate, much less a pint of Ben & Jerry's or an entire Toblerone. I have energy and stamina and stable blood sugar and I'm able to taste the natural sweetness in tea without drowning it in Splenda.<br />Even though I don't love the fact that the authors are right... I'm willing to admit that, in my experience, they have nailed everything so far.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|The Giver is an interesting perspective I did not imagine before.  I would recommend this book to every age because the language used is very easy to understand specially to speakers of other languages besides English.  I had the chance to read its translation briefly but it is not the same as the original. Great book to read!!
B008IGP8QE|3.0|I'm older than this generation of music so I really don't have an opinion on this music! so if you are younger it's probably wonderful!
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|There was not much in this book I liked.  The story was interesting yet some crude language, and jumping between three story lines, took a lot of pleasure out of the books flow.  My recommendation is to find yourself a better book.
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|It was a new story with the same premise as before (cop on the street is also judge and executioner) but it could have been any futuristic cop movie. The bad guys control a ghetto hi-rise, and serve as its defacto govt, even enjoying the protection of official agents, to a certain extent.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Considering that all the Guardians team up, it's good for any occasion. Takes place in Winter, & touches on Easter & Christmas. Loved it in the theater! As my 10 year old son & I were walking to the car, he wanted to know when would it be on DVD, cause he already wanted to see it again! Very entertaining.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|because it's a network show.  I thought that they wouldn't be allowed to do whatever they needed to do in terms of gore and general scariness.  I was definitely wrong.  Also, it has great special effects and is shot in a very aesthetically pleasing way.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book was funny & exuded Fey's standard self-deprecating charm. I had a great time reading about her start in improv, and also appreciating reading about a woman who isn't scared of what people will think of her when she's &#34;the boss.&#34; Fun read.
B008XG1X18|3.0|the original website rules. the app freezes too much. pinterest is great but the app needs some improvements. I had to redownload the app but not sure if it will work.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I picked this up as something to read for Banned Books week. It was more entertaining than I remembered, and was a quick read. You don't generally think of a dog as a relatable character, but London's voice for Buck is so clear, you really feel with the dog. Lots of fun.
B006S01GH2|4.0|Re-viewing this movie after many years it still remains a charming movie with a simple, yet effective story line that even manages to throw in a bit of useful advise of an old(er) wise man.  This was the movie that catapulted Audrey Tautoo to stardom and the big (earning) league and for good reason.  She fits this movie hand in glove!
B00DICGK24|2.0|The movie came from Thailand.  I had to change all the settings to English.<br /><br />The quality of the video was mediocre.
B008602KQI|3.0|The movie was entertaining. As with most movies adapted from books, there is quite a bit of the story that is lost in translation.
B002R27J1W|5.0|After seeing this film when it was brand new at the local movie house, for many years I counted it the best movie I'd ever seen.  Now, as a grownup, I divide my movie ratings up by genre -- best drama, best comedy, etc.  But &#34;Wait Until Dark&#34; still stands as one of the best thrillers ever, if not *the* best.  Tremendous performances by all involved, tension, surprises, suspense, a little humor and romance . . .  Whenever TV Guide would describe it, the magazine always said something along the lines of &#34;Three criminals terrorize a blind woman.&#34;  Nothing could be further from the truth.  They attempt to *con* her -- a classic scam.  We know it's a scam, but Susy (Audrey Hepburn) does not -- at least not at first.  I'll say no more so I won't ruin it for you.<br /><br />This film is worth your time, and then worth watching again to see how Frederick Knott's play builds to a classic, astonishing climax.  Watch it.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|This movie meets expectations. Lots of action and story line keeps moving at a good pace. Visual effects are pretty good.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|beside the fact that i cannot use it in my country (Israel) i understood (quite late) that i cannot streem movies from my tablet/smartphone to the t.v.
0385743564|5.0|For someone who is required to read dense and complex materials all day, I found Steelheart to be an enjoyable and relaxing experience. I wish it was longer, and am really looking forward to more books like this from Mr. Sanderson.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I saw this  a couple of years ago, it was very good.<br />I would recommed it, it's a lovely romantic movie
B00DGNOMB6|4.0|This is an enjoyable movie that will make you laugh. I suppose not everyone will see it the same as I did.
B00C2IF9SQ|5.0|I REALLY enjoyed this book!  I love learning about the lives of others, and this book didn't disappoint!  It was a quick, fun read.  I'm glad I read it and think others will like it too!  Such a great story!
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Great timeless children's adventure. My daughters aged 11 and 5 loved this movie. I had hoped that a sequel would have been done years ago. Good family fun. But not recommended for kids under 5.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I absolutely love this story. Conner needs someone to slap some sense into him at times but once he figures it out he does the right thing. Megan what was she thinking? Her life plan needed a lot of thinking. It was a well written story and I fell in love with Conner and Megan.
B006TVQTHW|4.0|This is a great basic case with an excellent cooling design. It is very quiet and keeps my system at or around 20 - 40 degrees centigrade (depending on load). It also has very good cable and space management. Installation of hardware is simple and straightforward. I'll buy another one of these cases if the need arises!
B000RLFJQ2|3.0|Ehhh... it was ok.  Not really a huge fan.  Got about 3/4  of the way through and it just wasn't holding my interest.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I've waited a few weeks before actually writing a review for this atrocious book. I'm still mad. No amount of sympathy-mongering done in the media by Charlaine Harris will redeem this time-suck of a book. I was an advocate of this series before the HBO series True Blood started. Now when someone asks me if they need to read the books too, I just tell them that if they must read them, then please try to stop around Book #8. For me, that is when Charlaine started the slow death-rattle of these beloved characters.<br /><br />She says that anyone who has written something negative about #13 is a bully and just can't deal with Sookie ending up with someone that we don't like. To me, that is beside the point. Don't create characters that are meant to be loved by the readers and then be completely shocked when there is anger over a rushed and almost ghost-written feel to the last 3 books. But alas, friends, contracts are contracts. She sold out a long time ago.<br /><br />She showed her true intentions several years back, when she admitted that she wanted to kill Bill Compton in Book #8. Her 'people' told her to rethink this move since True Blood was just beginning and everyone was 'supposed to fall in love' with Beehl 'The Southern Gentleman' Compton.<br /><br />Well, bless your heart Charlaine. I've wasted too many years and too much money to be fleeced by the likes of you again.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It was slower to load up Netflix than my PS3, with only two deticated apps to use, and you can't cast your personal pics or videos to tv, its not as great as I thought it would be.
B00DCRE7M0|5.0|While not quite as amazing as Static Impulse, the unchanged lineup of James' solo project creates another complete album.<br /><br />The first four tracks really stand out to me, but the album does weaken as the track list grows until the very end (a trait of James' former albums as well). Overall the music and vocal melodies are superb.<br /><br />My reasons why it is not as good as Static Impulse - less vocal range ability from James, less guitar soloing by the incredible Marco Sfogli, and the lack of captivating ballads like previous albums. Some of the lyrics in songs are kind of ridiculous but I've come to expect that from some of his stuff and as long as the melody and music is driving, I'm okay with it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this app! It works much better than the kindle (I purchased kindle touch, which worked for about 6 months and then stopped working... but this app has never failed me.) Instead of carrying a book or two everywhere I go, now I can simply open this app on my phone whenever I have a few minutes to kill (standing in a long line at checkout, sitting in a waiting room, traveling on the plane, etc). If you love to read and you have an android phone, this app is an absolute M-U-S-T.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|This album contains many great songs.  I thoroughly enoyed this music.  Can't wait for his next music project.  He was great at his concert and just as good in the album.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I wanted facebook on my kindle and I got the app to do that. I already have facebook on my phone and computer.
B0067EKY7M|4.0|Don't let the terrible title put you off this delightful movie.  It is more than a romantic comedy--it's a romantic comedy with emotional and political depths that are quite unusual and that are rarely achieved in many supposedly more serious films.  It is subtle, sly, serious, amusing, improbable, and quite moving.  The acting is quietly superb.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|I thought I was getting the game not a guide. This was not what I  was looking for. But I also have not tries to look up strategy to use. I may be helpful in the future.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|i like allot of songs from this album. the quality is clear, i don't have any complaints at all. giggity!
B008D28HYS|5.0|increasingly challenging. a lot of fun. Great UI<br />takes a bit to truly understand, at least for me, but it is very enjoyable. I find it very calming
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a cool and addictive game - I like it much better than majong.<br />There are different ways to play - love it!
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Awesome price for this watch. If your looking for a nice watch that won't put you in the poor house this is it.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|This story needed more detail.  The majority of the movie was running away from the zombies and searching for the cause.  Duh!  it needed some new twist or explanation.  Something.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Love this app. I got addicted, very fast. The only downside is I wish it had more levels. Still a great game.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|The special effects were wicked!  The story line could have been a little clearer, but overall it was a good flick.
0307271080|5.0|An excellent book, very easy to read. Ms. Adichie draws you into the story. She gives great insight into the America of today and the way in which foreigners especially those from Africa might be treated.  Ms. Adichie has great insight on the racial differences of the young and not so young.  There is a wonderful love story woven into the fiber of this story of migration.<br />A MUST READ FOR ALL<br />Ages 16 +
B0089LOG02|5.0|Great Book! One of the best books I read. The book hooks you on the first page and you keep reading it until the end.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great series! Loved all three books! Can't wait for thr fourth to come out! Looking forward to reading more about Gideon and Eva!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This the only way I can catch-up with family and friends. I think posting pics and seeing others pics is a real draw for me.
B00846REIS|4.0|now reading the trilogy, but this book started off really slow but once I got to chapter 5 or 7 thing picked up
B00DU16OJM|5.0|A moving tribute to his wife and muse...Susannah will be missed but this is a loving reminder of her life
B00CO8TA4I|5.0|ill be report more info later this is the best choice for 200 $ buy if you want the best compute process
B007SYWFRM|2.0|I have the kindle fire and it says that you have to update to keep playing...yet there is no new update available in the Amazon market. I love this game and want to keep playing! Please hurry so I won't my my daily reward!
0553381407|5.0|Helpful. Sent it to my daughter in law.  I guess she thinks she has toxic parents!!!  Glad my own son didn't want it. ;)
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|Ok so I got this game and I liked it at first but there is a challenge impossible on the kindle which is stopping all the blood holes...that bummed me when I couldn't pass because of it
1451648537|4.0|I loved this book -- way better than the film Jobs. It had a lot of good intereviews with his friends and some of his \\"not-so-good-friends\\" as well.<br /><br />Would love to have had an interview with his wife but she apparently she must value her privacy. Who could blame her?<br /><br />(I would definitely send it to people who may find a bit of themselves in it!)
B008XKSW7M|3.0|I was expecting nothing but comedy, but this movie definitely puts you on an emotional roller coaster.  Great PMS movie!  Prepare yourself for a lot more than just funny preggo antics.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|Miss the drama and interest of #1 and 2. In fact, after #3 I may skip #4 all together! -- (Okay I lied... I decided to watch season 4 and I find it very well done.) Mary still is as still as a board and will grow up to become a nasty old woman, but the servants are a sweet and Maggie Smith is beyond wonderful. It's worthwhile to watch it if only for her.)
B008CRC506|4.0|I liked the music when it was on the tube.  Bought the DVD so I can see again. Good cast too.
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|I have always been a fan of Whedon's work and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D has not dissappointed. Strong characters and innovative plots are already evident 2 episodes in. I can't wait to see where it goes from here.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a great bingo game to play with family and friends on facebook. You can meet new friends too. I really enjoy playing this game when I have free time.
B005I548B4|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I got to a stage where could not put it down. A truly magical and heart warming story!<br />This is my first Nicholas Sparks book and I will definitely be buying all of his books!
1416972242|4.0|really enjoyed it even though it was a little slow sometimes. I can't wait to read the next book.  really good and different story
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The books were amazing. The suspense and intense emotions were thrilling to read. I found myself reading till 2am sometimes because the books were so intreaging and hard to find a stopping spot. Nothing like I have ever read before.
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|Dave Grohl would be my best friend if we would have met before he got famous. I am sure everyone feels that way. He is so cool and this documentary proves that he will continue to do cool things outside of music. It goes to show if there is a passion behind the intent, things turn out awesome.
B00BB8Q1RQ|5.0|This movie was absolutely amazing. It backed the audience into a corner over a very controversial topic: abortion. I would recommend this movie to anyone who isn't afraid to question their beliefs, and look into yourself and see what you find.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Clear, useable advise that works. I recommend everyone read and follow what she teaches to shift mindset. I've recommended it to my entire office
B00BJNHACS|4.0|It's a good game and it also is very addicting !!! I also enjoyed the physics involved with the racing. It's worth your money $$$ and time.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|Simply the greatest movie ever made! Perfect blend of great acting,directing and writing make for an unforgettable movie experience. I can watch this over and over and never get tired of it.
B00DQBWLSO|4.0|As always, Mayer's singing, song writing and guitar playing are top notch. I bought this CD prior to seeing him in concert for the first time recently. Now it's in my car and on my playlist all the time.
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|The constant written instructions make it difficult for my 4-year-old to play by herself, and they try to get you to buy stuff about every 5 seconds.  Other than that, it's cute.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|It is a good story, great special effects.  It was a very entertaining, fun, not too deep kind of movie.
B008Y212PI|5.0|A great game. You really have to pay attention to the number of squares so you don't make a mistake. Three mistakes and you are out. You can turn off the mistake counter if you want to.
B001QB9ETK|4.0|A fantastic cast. Put those people together in any movie and you have a ticket to brillance. The setting combined with Oscar level cinematagraphy is stunning. I'm extremely familiar with the history so the ending was no surprise. When this came out there was tremendous discussion in academia and in a certain agency I worked for. Some called it propaganda. Not really, the philosophy of the Jesuits was well presented. But, as Hollywood is prone to do, an event that was almost generational was condensed. I give it four stars only because I wish the true scope of the story could have been somehow addressed. That said, you should see this. The history of Latin America, outside of a couple items in Mexico, is virtually unknown in the US.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|A decent premise for a movie, but man what a downer. Really, everyone gets eaten by wolves...the end.  The writer was too lazy to work on character development, conflict resolution or human growth through conflict, tragedy or confronting danger.  Can't believe I stayed up late to watch this crap.
B001ANUV0A|5.0|I bought this blu-ray after seeing a few clips from it on YouTube.  It is seriously my favorite live show of all time.  John Mayer plays three different sets--acoustic, jazz trio, and full band.  The sound quality and video are phenomenal, and it is a fantastic show.  I've seriously found myself watching this about once a week for a couple months.
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|Great cinematography, but that is it.  Weak, unbelievable story, poor acting. Really violent with the animal scenes, so it  it is not appropriate for kids.
B002ZG99TK|1.0|Beware I got my copy and it is a low quality download to media player.  Does not go into any online library.  Twentieth Century Fox has there own thing it appears.
B000LC55F2|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie its a must ! I normally have a movie figured out by half way thru this one took alot longer
B001BANK32|5.0|Read this long time ago.Never gets old. Ready to read the next chapter of Dan's life. King never disappoints. Better than the movie.
B000OVLINI|2.0|The story rambles on and is too hard to follow. Too wordy. Half way through the book, it gets a little better, but still confusing.
B00FKSJ3YG|2.0|Joss Whedon has done a lot of terrific TV projects and I continuously wish him a lot of work and success. This is not one of those unfortunately, and I suggest it will probably not make it to a second season, and definitely not past 2 seasons.<br /><br />The fatal flaw is the casting. The lead actor Clark Gregg who plays Poulson just doesn't have enough charisma to anchor a show. Additionally, he can't pull off the Whedon voice. The sarcasm and irony are awkward on him.  The second fatal casting flaw can be summed up in three words that are synonymous with untalented actor: Ming. Na. Wen.  Ming Na-Wen is a so thoroughly untalented actor that she could not even convincingly portray an over-the-hill Chinese actress.  Maybe, and I stress MAYBE, she could convincingly portray a dead body, but likely only with the help of a heavy sedative.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|I was very disappointed in the main character, as she was hard to root for. She disappoints every one who tries to help her.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|A wonderful app!!  I love being able to search the weather  and time in any city in the world at any given time!  Especially those where I have friends and relatives living.
B00AEBB9V4|4.0|This was a movie of mystery and i loved it. J deep at his finest.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|I pre ordered this. Stephen king is to my reading like the Seattle Seahawks are to my football....none better. Which, sometimes opens me up to higher expectation than i should have. I wish he would have brought in more of the Shining novel...flash backs maybe..but im not let down..i would read the book jack wrote at the overlook..where he wrote the same line over and over again..snd love it.<br />JanyBee
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This is a pretty fun game for adults. I don't like in game purchasing but it is a minor setback that didn't affect all of the game play.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This is a book written from a very objective perspective by an author who has a Ph.D in the study of religions--ALL religions, not just one. He writes from an HISTORICAL perspective rather than the usual dogmatic perspective. I found it immensely readable and I learned a lot from it.
1451620829|4.0|Wow!  I thought Peter would go into some detail about his drinking and drugs and maybe tying one one here and there, but the things he did were just nasty and gross.  This being said after I've read many other bios such as Tommy Lee, Vince Neil, David Lee Roth, etc.<br /><br />Peter seems to be bragging about his drug use and saying how much fun is was rather than regretting it. He mocks out Paul and Gene for being straight-minded and then goes into how much fun he and Ace had getting blasted.  How uptight Paul and Gene are and how laid back he is because he'd walk around the hotel they were at without any clothes on.  He mentioned a few times that the drug binges were fun and doesn't seem to show any remorse.<br /><br />He puts down his bandmates saying how strange they are.  He talks having sex w/ multiple girls in orgy situations and bisexual behavior or Ace, even though he says he knows he \\"likes chicks.\\"  He hints several times at Paul Stanley's sexuality and says Gene is smelly and gross and will have sex with any girl no matter how smelly and gross she is.  He goes into detail about the women he had while married to his wife he didn't want to have sex with as she wasn't as \\"worldly\\" as the girls on the road.<br /><br />It's interesting reading, but hard to read because I don't know if I like him so much after reading this.  Comes off sounding cold, cocky and gross.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I have liked hero sagas since heroes unlimited.  This one was very good.  I think that the link between power and corruption is among the most human of all motivations.  The difference between a Spiderman and a Magneto.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a book I could not put down.  I enjoyed the interplay of the main characters and the plot kept me on my toes.  It was a very enjoyable read.
B008YKGQR4|2.0|I could never get it to work so I just deleted it from my devise.  It may just have been a timing thing, but it also shouldn't take longer than 2 minutes to load.
B00632HWOG|5.0|My Kindle let's me know I have mail without opening this app. It is a must have. I scroll down on my kindle 's face and immediately I am in my Yahoo Mail. It's becoming more valuable to me because I am not opening my laptop to view my emails. I could use my phone; however, I prefer check on my Kindle because the screen is bigger, and I can maneuver better on my Kindle more than my phone.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I like this game. addictive, fun, and challenging. just wish you could buy stuff with the coins. but it is a fun game. I would recommend it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the app. It has different translations of the Bible, in addition to reading plans. You cannot go wrong with this app. In the reading plans section there are different topics related to various subject besides the Bible. Example, health issues and the six foods that give you energy. I love it.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Great movie that all children and adults can enjoy.  Very fun movie and finally has the bad guy as the good guy.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|I thought the movie was good! We almost didn't watch it because of the one star rating.... I'm glad we decided to watch it ! I had very low expectations and maybe that's why it was good!
B00F35BV64|5.0|Good movie to watch at home with the family. I have always been a big fan of anything Star Trek....
1250030951|5.0|I am not in the target audience for this book; I'm not a new adult (I don't think 39 counts), college is long in the past, and I'm only vaguely aware of fan fiction.  I read this book because I really enjoyed Rainbow Rowell's last two books.  And I LOVED this book.  Although I finished this book and started reading others, I'm still thinking about the characters in Fangirl, to the point that when I'm trying to orient myself in another book, I'm ascribing the characters with attributes of Cath and Levi.  I think each of Rainbow Rowell's new novels surpasses the one before it, which I didn't think possible (especially after reading Eleanor and Park).  Whatever your age or situation in life, read Rainbow Rowell.  Her books are simply awesome.
B007YQ9MWK|4.0|I have been listening all day, and have enjoyed it immensely.  The performances of Simon Standage (violin) and Lisa Beznosiuk (flute) are exceptional.  The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the lack of information regarding each piece when the mp3 is downloaded.

B0070Z97LG|5.0|Enjoyed this perfect chilling drama and found myself lost in it's amazing group of actors.  I'm sending to my daughter.  Nope, won't give anything away, but to say..........from the stunning beginning to the end, I enjoyed the entire file and would highly recomend.
1577314808|4.0|Haven't finished the book yet, but I am enjoying it so far.<br />The way it's written can be a little hard to understand at times so be prepared to have to reread some sections again.<br />I know I did for it to sink in.  I found the book to very helpful & showing me where living in the future was causing me undue stress.<br />Would def recommend!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Speechless.... Fantastic ending and now i will have to share this with others!!!!!!!!!!!!! I will never read books the same way again. Period
B0084670FU|5.0|We often never know the end results of our actions.  This film makes one really think about what they are doing or NOT doing, and to realize that we are all connected--the ripples extend....who knows how far?
B00F91H666|3.0|It is an old issue,well developed. Good actors but too long movie (more than 2 hours?).  Good to be watched at home, on Sunday.
B0091REZMW|4.0|VERY FUN BUT you need lots of friends to be successful.I also wish my energy would renew faster, I'm not a huge gamer but this is fun.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Awesome movie...not much more to say other than that!!  The extras are great and the digital copy is outstanding for my iPad/iPhone so I can take it on the go.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I have a room that's about 10ft x 10ft with the TV on east side of the room and my router is in the room adjacent to mine on the other side of the west wall. If that's too hard to visualize, the chromecast and router are separated by about 10ft through one wall and through the TV itself.<br /><br />I'm using an older Dell XPS 15 L502X (i5 2410M) and when I can get a decent signal, it works great. On the idle screen the reception would mostly stay at one bar and would occasionally go up to two wifi bars.<br /><br />I tried tab streaming South Park from the official site using the computer (by casting a tab with the chrome extension) and the video quality was there, but it would drop the connection after about 5 minutes. I need to revisit my router settings (I'm using a Belkin N300 with TomatoUSB, on only G with N disabled) since I might be on 40MHz which may be causing the bad reception. Other devices in the house can get reliable reception up to about ~30 feet, and this is through multiple walls so I know it's something to do with the device itself (or an incompatible router setting).<br /><br />Setup was very easy through the iOS app, no complaints there. I had the option to set it up through the computer but my phone was more convenient. I briefly tried the Netflix app to stream from my iPhone but it just got stuck on the spinner icon.<br /><br />Only other thing I can say is that maybe the HDMI extender should be a little longer so it can possibly clear the TV, though I'm not sure that would do much for the reception anyway.<br /><br />The USB Cable is an OK length (not sure exactly how long) and it works for me because there is an Xbox 360 nearby for its USB ports. I could see how this can be a problem for other users without a USB port on their TV and they'd probably need an extension cord with the AC adapter.<br /><br />Great value here, but I'm hoping for an update to fix the wifi issues sometime soon. Will update my review later on if they do decide to update or if I'm able to fix the problem myself.<br /><br />UPDATE: I changed my router from Auto G/N (I previosuly thought it was on G only) switching to just G and at the same time set the bandwidth from 40MHz to 20MHz and now the device gets a full signal. The 40MHz setting was probably at fault but I thought I remembered reading it doesn't work too well with N anyway. I've bumped up the stars from 3 to 4, but not 5 because of some weird issues I've been getting (but it's in Beta after all). I played a youtube video in Chrome on my PC and used the Chromecast button inside the youtube player (instead of the extension button next to the address bar) and the video got stuck looping on my TV. I would try to play a different video and the new title would display but would eventually switch back to the looping video after a few seconds. Removing the power cord didn't fix it. I can't remember my exact steps but I ended up using my iPad mini to take over the Chromecast and play something else.<br /><br />I'm also surprised to see that my mid 2009 MacBook Pro can only handle 480p video tab streaming and still sometimes stutters for a fraction of a second whereas my 2010 Dell XPS-15 dual core i5 (base model) can stream everything fine.
B008JFUO36|3.0|Was a pretty good movie but was hard to keep up with. Never really made much sense. Good acting but the story line to long and to confusing.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Beneath all of the raunch is a great and captivating love story.. I Couldn't put any of the books down..
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is a great app to be able to put a puzzle together on the go.  I recommend it to everyone.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is way better.  Doesn't just show you the items but lets you make exceptions. Shows the megabytes involved. Has a nice cache cleaner too, with the same features. (Doesn't delete passwords). Also will advise you not to remove something occasionally. They've done one update since I've had it, with noticeable improvements.
B008P1EWIM|3.0|This app tells you the current time &amp; temp and is really beautiful to look at (screen background matches current conditions, even night sky and stars) but there isn't any verbal description of what's coming other than little cloud, sun, rain, etc. icons for each hour.  I use it because it's always running and just one click away, but when planning ahead a few days for golf or outdoor activities, I end up going to the web and looking it up on other sites.  Add a little descriptive paragraph, though, and this would rate a 5 in my opinion.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I received this as a suggestion on Pixel of Ink, and I am so glad that I purchased it!  Excellent book, very moving and a great historical piece about a real part of our American lives.  I love  how the author wove the two main characters together, you felt for both of them from page 1.  The end had me in tears but they were happy tears....now I wish the book went on and on!!!
0141339667|5.0|bought for grandkids for present<br />they have enjoyed reading the series<br />will buy more as they become available to read
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|In addition to riveting and detailed accounts of various major US nuclear weapons accidents, the book contains hundreds of facts, details of many serious bomb related incidents, and is also replete with cogent observations on past and present nuclear weapon policy and politics. This includes details on weapon types, delivery systems, military strategy, control and deployment policy, not only for the US but some facts on other nuclear nations as well. The author presents information you would be hard pressed to find elsewhere, if you could find it at all. For instance, the Bravo test of the hydrogen fusion weapon 'Shrimp', with a lithium/deuterium solid core. The detonation on a Pacific atoll killed Japanese fisherman outside the exclusion zone, and left nuclear scientists twenty miles from ground zero in a concrete bunker scrambling for their lives as they were showered with lethal fallout. The bomb turned out to be many times bigger than they had expected. 10 such bombs on the west coast of Britain could destroy Britain as a functioning nation. It was kept secret, of course. Schlosser covers US nuclear weapons from Hiroshima to recent years, and command/control challenges and changes. The book involved an enormous amount of research which he catalogs in the epilogue.<br /><br />For many readers the facts on the history of control deployment, targeting and war plans for US atomic weapons over past decades, particularly the '50's and 60's, may be of more interest than the nuclear accidents like the Titan II catastrophe in Damascus, Arkansas. The never/always balance for nuclear bomb core detonation, never by accident, always when intended.  Rivalry between the Air Force and the Navy for control of their nuclear arsenals use and targeting, the Navy had one plan the Air Force another. Eisenhower giving authority to start a nuclear war to theater commanders. The 1960 SIOP plan to vaporize 220 million Russians, Chinese and others in a single massive strike. Curtis LeMay's desire for a 65 megaton weapon. With this in mind, the author's technique of skipping back and forth chapter by chapter, from the Damascus incident to national nuclear issues could be seen as both unnecessary and annoying to readers. The book might have been better laid out as two parts, one on major accidents and the other on nuclear bomb/technology/policy history. Regardless of this, the book is worth 5 stars. ((Kindle)location 296 - text states the Titan II silo door weighed 740 tons. The Titan silo doors weighed 74 tons (correct figure given later in the book).
B00336C3EY|5.0|A Serious Man is one of my very favorite movies, which is why I purchased 2 copies to share with friends.  The movie is quirky, funny, awesomely filmed, and captivating.
B005LAIIGM|4.0|\\"Gravity\\" is the first film from Mexican director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n in six long years. His last film, \\"Children of Men,\\" was also a critically acclaimed science fiction film that impressed viewers with its incredible and breathtaking single-take action sequences. \\"Gravity\\" has been gaining even more praise with even director James Cameron calling it \\"the best space film ever made.\\" With \\"Gravity,\\" Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n has created a near perfect and terrifying 3D journey of desolation.<br /><br />You see Kowalski supervising Dr. Stone in the opening of the film. There's a lot of small talk on Kowalski's end; an endless amount of stories on his part, a love for alcohol, and knowledge of his good looks that he throws into conversations with ease. Dr. Stone, on the other hand, is very nervous. They've already spent a week up in space and she just wants to get her feet back on stable ground. In other words, Kowalski is extremely relaxed while Dr. Stone can't stop being clenched up and tense.<br /><br />This is one film that demands to be seen in 3D. Next to the screw flying into the camera that you've probably seen in trailers, pretty much anything that floats in zero gravity leaps off of the screen. There's a certain action figure that'll likely get a few laughs while drops of water, human tears, and a variety of astronaut gear drift into the foreground and hover directly in front of your face.<br /><br />The space elements are exceptional. Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n's perspective of space is just mesmerizing. Sometimes it's the little things like the reflection in someone's helmet or taking in the view amongst all of the destruction that wind up impressing you. The silence is deafening. Space in film has never felt so quiet and haunting. The carnage caused by the debris is also astonishing. Not only is it a wonder to watch unfold, but it's amazing to see anyone emerge unscathed from such devastation.<br /><br />The one issue may not be a dilemma for everyone. Sandra Bullock's Ryan Stone makes this really heartfelt speech about where she comes from and her daughter pretty early on. It's extremely emotional and character defining. Needless to say, it's effective and memorable. What nearly ruins it though is that Stone tries to make another speech just like it in the final moments of the film and it seems completely corny in comparison. Up to a certain point, it works just fine but the whole \\"it's been one hell of a ride\\" part of it just debunks the whole thing and throws it into lame territory.<br /><br />\\"Gravity\\" practically redefines the space genre with its dizzying outlook of space, stunning cinematography, and the overwhelming sensation of being utterly alone. The sense of helplessness in \\"Gravity\\" is unlike anything you've ever experienced in a film before; an endless struggle to survive only heightened by the film's excellent 3D effects.makes this really heartfelt speech about where she comes from and her daughter pretty early on.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|Love this touching, funny (in a soft way), quirky movie.  I could watch the dance scene over and over again!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Great little app for your phone. Works great on my galaxy s3 phone. Thoroughly recommend it for anyone who needs to remotely control their pc.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|It's not Buffy or Angel good, but the personal interatctions between the leads makes this very enjoyable. This series is full of talent, and the writing is crisp (not Joss Wedon crisp, but then what is?), and the plotting is good. Should mature into a much better show.
1439190275|5.0|The New Atkins For A New You book  is also great.  I reply on it and refer to it daily.
0061950726|5.0|This is a wonderful book giving the reader a very good insight into the orphan train experience from all sides.  The book arrived in good condition and I was able to track its progress on-line.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|The Four Agreements has helped me in my journey to improve myself and my understanding of other people.  It is easy to understand and, although following the precepts is not easy, it is worth trying.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Never liked bingo till Bingo Blitz. It is a fun game to play and time flys while you are playing it.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is awesome except for the update that just popped up and says to download to continue playing. I push the download button and it takes me to the game menu with no download available.  I don't know what to do about it.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|The movie is exactly what the seller said, with a quick delivery. Was able to download to my units leaving me the opportunity to watch while on the road with no hassles of added items to carry. Mission Impossible again gave wonderful movie entertainment.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|I've been a big fan of both Derek and Susan, but this collaboration has taken them to new musical heights.  Its not just about Derek's amazing guitar work or Susan's sultry vocals, it's a total musical package. There is not a weak links in this group, and it shows.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Received in great time not to mention a great movie that is entertaining. The movie showed no problems with the DVD and it was even greater that I got to download it to my computer so I can watch it while traveling if I wish.
B005MYEQ9U|5.0|The two female voices made this opera for me.  The men were good but the women were fantastic.The sadness of the ending was too much for my husband but there again Anna's voice was from heaven above.
B000GPIPD8|5.0|Love this album along with Brothers and El Camino.  Great for me to work by in my studio.  Would definitely recommend it.
B00F56AZK4|5.0|This app really can keep your mind sharp.  I would highly recommend for people who enjoy puzzles and really great for middle of the night.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|If you work in a small business who won't spend the cash for a good handheld wifi scanner, or maybe just do this kind of work on the side for your family, this is a must have.  While it has several screens of information, the one I find the most useful is the spectrum analyzer screen that will draw you out a map of what SSID is in the area, what channel it's on, and its strength.  This free version isn't spammy with the adverts like some (just the little banner at the bottom) and the homescreen widget works fine.  Network geeks, get this app if you haven't already.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|such a good book. its a page turner from start to finish. itleaves you to draw your own conclusions at the end
B001UGB1X8|5.0|Just found this movie and decided to watch it because I tend to like Tommy Lee Jones movies.  This one paid off. Not a boring moment. Nothing clear, all tied up in riddles and knots. Reminds me of The Prestige. Loved this movie.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Another searching look into the country of  Afghanistan.....especially  thought provoking for those who have grown up iina democratic  basically Juddao/Christian society.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|We all love Downton Abbey, it is the rich, prominent elegant people.  This show is about the average and poor people struggling to feed and take of their families.  Both the countryside and town have some very interesting characters.  The actors are great, and one of my favorites is the lovely woman who owns the post office.  I am hoping she falls in love, marries and has a baby.  I wish we had many more tv shows like this one!

B000L53D4O|5.0|Works well for the purpose and breaks down for easy storage. My little girl loves the gadgets on the front.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I never thought that anyone could replace McCoy or Sulu let alone Spock but I have rarely been so glad to be wrong! The cast and effects (not to mention a great story line) are magnificent. If you have been afraid that they would ruin the Star Trek franchise this movie will put those fears to rest and I highly recommend it.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This is a wonderful book. Extremely well researched, and fascinating. It was wonderful to see Jesus placed in his time in history . I find myself referring to it often in general conversation.
B006LXQID8|5.0|It was weird but fun at the same time I enjoyed it a lot. Got some questionable scenes in it, so parents use caution, however its a perfect romantic comedy for a date.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I am an original Trekker!  I love the way the movies have been handled.  i like the way the relationships between the characters is oft times serious, but funny at time. Subtle little things like sudden the  realization of just who the enemy was. I loved the way that he was introduced in the Story.
B00005NGAK|5.0|Being from Irish Ancestry, I love Lord of the Dance, and Feet of Flames is Lord of the Dance on Steroids, bigger cast, largest outdoor stage (at time of its release) ever, new music and great quality. If you love Celtic dancing and music, this is one to check out.
B00006L9ZT|5.0|I remember the orginal Presentation of the Ring on PBS and I was absolutely in awe.  This was before the days of DVD Players and disks. This was the day of Video tape and weak cable connections. So you know that I am a little old, anyway.<br /><br />If you have chance to rent or buy this great opera please do so.  It is not a series of opera singers standing in front of an orchestra dressed in tuxedos and beautiful dresses.  The Ring is staged with costumes, sets that move and special effects which are not computer generated effects. CGI  had not been invented yet . There are different artists that perform in each story of the Ring. Jessie Norman, whom some of you may not know, sings in this masterwork. I was awed by her voice. She was one of the very first African American women to alowed to sing at the Met and in other operactic venues. I was and am impressed with her vast talent.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very realistic and fun! One of the best horse games I have ever played. It gives easy instructions on how to do the tasks!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Great movie !!!I cant find this movie anywhere on its own and its the only one i didnt have in my collection
B00594XOZU|1.0|This app doesn't let me log in anymore also it doesn't let me creat a new account please fix this app
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|I won't be tricked into giving you a good rating<br />This is a really shady way to get a review by shutting the app down.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like this app.  many translations to get the best meaning.  BIBLE devotions are great.  helps you withh everyday life.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Can you say addicted!  I can't stop playing these games.  If you are looking for a great puzzle that will challenge your brain give it a try
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love this app. The mystery of it and sound effects were amazing I recommend it to anyone who  has played 100 floors because it's 100 times better the ending is se unexpected.  don't use your hints it will make the game last longer. I am going back to play! I have never been so in love with a mystery game to go back and play it again. I HOPE THEY MAKE THE ROOM 2 SOON!!!!!
1400052181|5.0|Arrived quickly and just as described. I needed the book for a class and appreciated the product being in good condition, affordable and the quick shipment
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Great story. I wanted it to last forever! The graphics were also great! Amazon points well spent on this full game!
B004MC8CA2|3.0|Thought this was audio. Plus, I wanted a Bible to read at random; this is only plans for reading - a few chapters at a time. If you're looking to read the Bible in one year, this is great.
B000G28IZ6|4.0|I like this shoe, the in side feels great, its a little wide but i can live with it.<br />The two shoes do not look perfectly the same.<br />One looks to be stitched down and to the right.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This review has long been sitting on my Drafts folder, because I couldn't, for the life of me, find the words to tell you how crazy the story was and how badly it appealed to me.<br /><br />I admit, I was really curious when news about a billionaire named Christian Grey hit the Internet like wildfire. I said to myself, \\"oh, come on, what's this fuss all about? Who the heck is Christian Grey?\\"<br /><br />And then came the opportunity to read this. No, I didn't buy the book but I had my resources. The first part was kinda okay, Anastasia Steele interviewed the billionaire Grey and sparks flew, blah blah, blah. I actually liked Grey a bit.<br /><br />Then came the sex scenes. Oh boy, I was shattered. No, really! Here I was, I thought, \\"hey this was a nice book, etc.. and suddenly, what a crap? what kind of world did I just get into? It was like, oh, she climaxed. And on another page, she screamed. And then on next, she was tied up in the Red Room, and climaxed again. Then the next time they had it, she was having a red day and they still did it, ewww.\\"  And then they did it again.. and again.. and again. Oh my, Anastasia and Christian are two f***ed-up energizer bunnies!<br /><br />So sorry, I think this book was a little too much for me. I thought I could handle it. But seriously, I would have trade it for another Brenda Jackson novel than to read the next Grey installment. No offense to the author EL James, but I think, Brenda Jackson writes better than her, even if Brenda isn't as popular. Just my two cents.
1452101248|3.0|Was a little disappointed as it concentrated too mug<br />Ch on single produce but to be fair haven't cooked from it yey
1401938906|4.0|This book was an easy read and fun along the way.<br /><br />I like her optimism and the experiments are fun and exciting.  I'm a believer in the law of attraction, so this book was kind of &#34;preaching to the choir&#34; for me, but I would highly recommend it!
160774418X|4.0|Great 30th birthday present.<br />Good breath of recipes which are interesting and achievable. Will be a standard from me for quite a while.
B008Y212PI|4.0|In order to play bonus game, you need to go to Facebook or write a review.  I like the game, it's fun and you can pick it up and spend a few minutes and get on with your day.  I hope the bonus game is worth it, after all I did pay for the game and<br /> shouldn't that include the bonus game?
B00E9P959O|5.0|This remix only serves to emphasize how bad the original mix was.  I'm simply stunned by how much detail was buried originally....It's hard to believe that all those guitar parts and vocal tracks were there all along.  Did you know that Ceiling Unlimited had a guitar solo in it?  Me neither, until now.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This thing is awesome!  Just plug it into the TV then get on any computer on the network and start up Chrome to set it up.  Very simple, anyone can do it.  Some reviews complain that the video freezes up, but even using my laptop that doesn't play video very well it works fine.<br /><br />When you're on netflix or youtube just make sure that you start &#34;casting&#34; using the cast icon displayed on the video menu with the play/pause options (as opposed to the cast icon on the browser).  Casting from the browser displays everything that is happening on the browser - and playing video on your computer AND the TV makes it freeze so bad it's basically useless, at least with my equipment.<br /><br />Wish you could display anything from your computer screen on the TV (like saved movies, video games, etc.), but youtube and netflix pretty much covers everything you might want.  For this price and easy functionality it's an incredible value.  I think this tilts the scale enough that I can completely ditch cable.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|who doesn't like this...yes cheesy movie, but channing tatum dances and strips...it's a break from reality and life...theres worse movies!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Good story line, clean vocabulary and our girls are learning about a different culture.  It gets a little soap opery at times, but good.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Perfect fit into the 3 book so far. I am not a reader.. my niece and sister in law talked me into these books.. and good thing cause I'm excited to get the third one and find out how this all end!
B00873GRU4|5.0|I won't rehash the six thousand-odd reviews already left for this gem, but I will say, as an author, you dream of writing a story this good.  The pace is perfect, revealing plot and characters with an excellent sense of timing.  It gathered meaning so well the longer it went.  The concept is believable due to the authenticity of the author's voice, the detail of the world, and the actions of all the characters.  The outstanding writing had me anticipating the next language delight, something I find rarer these days.  Clearly the author has paid his dues in the written word.<br /><br />Amazing story, and I envy those who are yet to discover it for the first time.
1439153663|5.0|This book was shipped in very good time and in good condition.  I enjoyed the book very much and would recommend this book to anyone.
B009RX7IX8|4.0|Still having too much fun watching this series.  Great interaction with the characters and the story lines.  Hopefully the fun will never end, but do know that it will.  But still, great fun to watch.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It was wonderful revisiting the little boy from The Shining, and seeing what sort of adult he became.  I really found the story and the characters compelling.  King is so good at mixing nightmare horror and good old horror of the human condition.  Finally, I would like especially to say that I absolutely loved Abra!
B003Q6D2BE|3.0|Can the elder humans have fun and save the world or the moment?  The answer is &#34;yes&#34;.  Just give them some time and watch this movie with some friends or enemies (your choice).
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|and we hear her loud and clear. The dance songs are catchy, the more I listen the more I like them. But those ballads. I always thought \\"Heart of Stone\\" was her best song ever. But \\"Sirens\\"! Her voice is just so pure, it's like honey, so beautiful, so different............so Cher. Thank you, Cher! You showed em' didn't you. That's how it's done. Take that you b*&tches.
B00DHRLK84|3.0|The movie is okay to watch and wonder if it is possible an infection to cause so much problems.  Or is someone just making a statement to let the humans know that there can be a point on no return.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Having always been so torn between science and spirit - wanting to KNOW more, this book does it!  Very enlightening and encouraging!
0894803123|4.0|I love this little book. It has the recipe for one of my favorite ice cream flavors: Cherry Garcia. With numerous basic flavors, chocolate ice creams, sorbets, Ben & Jerry's greatest hits and some unconventional flavors (I would never think of making cantaloupe ice cream) there's something in here for everyone. Most recipes make a generous quart, which sometimes causes a small overflow in my 1.5 quart ice cream maker, [[ASIN:B0041A3KPC Cuisinart ICE-21R Frozen Yogurt-Ice Cream & Sorbet Maker, Red]].<br /><br />The ice cream tastes delicious, the sweet cream base being the star of the show. Unfortunately, all the recipes with eggs call for them raw, with no alternative instructions for cooking them. This doesn't bother me so much, but it does bother my husband. He did really like the beer sorbet when made with Guinness.<br /><br />Recently, I made the Raspberry ice cream; it came out a little tart, more like Raspberry-Lemon. The recipe calls for the juice of half a lemon. I think the intention was for the juice of half a hand squeezed lemon, and not one squeezed with the [[ASIN:B000VB6M3W Amco 8-Inch Two-in-One Lemon Juicer/Squeezer]]. It was still tasty.<br /><br />There is more to the book than ice cream. There is the Ben & Jerry back story, a section on the science of ice cream, and sections of baked goods and desserts made with ice cream. There are tidbits of information complete with cartoons on the pages' margins which give the book a \\"fun\\" feel.<br /><br />I would have liked some information on frozen yogurt and gelato. However, I believe the book was published before Ben & Jerry's started making their frozen yogurts and I've never seen a gelato container with their name on it.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|Works well used daily in day spa for pedicure massage. The item is used in my day spa for pick up during business<br />when vacuuming is too disturbing.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I like this cover very much, the price was good, keeps my kindle clean, helps to protect from damage.  Plus there are several hands free ways to it up.  Recommend.
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|This was not what I expected, found that I do  not use it at all, a waste of time, do not like.
B003F3PMYI|4.0|Entertaining,too.<br /><br />Watch his Ted talk. You get a good sense of who he is and what his message is from the Ted talk. I bought the book after watching it.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|This app is easy to download and works well. I have received a few updates and use it when I need to find information.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great game!  5 yr old had a little trouble working it out but once she got the hang if it she was off and running! Love the sound effects, makes it more enjoyable for her and isn't nails in a chalk board for us.
B00F2LIV4E|5.0|After holding my breath after ADTOE release, wondering whether the &#34;return&#34; of DT as I'd come to love them was going to sustain itself...<br /><br />Am relieved, delighted, ecstatic to see another home run out of these guys!<br /><br />BUY THE ALBUM!!!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This free app is great if you want to wake up on time, I use it everyday.The full version (which costs money) has music and noises.I prefer noises over music,therefore this app is for me.I love this app!
B009K916ZK|5.0|This is the important to get the original brand, maybe you can find bad experiences if jus thing with your wallet
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|The game is a lot of fun. Getting to use alternate characters can make it easier to get three stars on a level. The game is a little buggy on the kindle fire, and right now there are only two levels, so that's why I gave it four stars.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Love the graphics the gameplay but there is one problem there is no car damage so if u crash the Windows don't get smashed but on my friends I pad it dose PLEAS FIX THIS FOR KINDLE
B004RFYEEC|5.0|The absolute genius of musical creativity that is Brian Wilson shines brighter than the sun in this set. Why this wasn't released when long ago will forever remain a mystery to me.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Damn you Downton Abbey.  How can you desert me for the summer?  I won't have any motivation to iron clothes for 4 more months.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I'll start by saying that my son loves all things Minecraft and this has become one of his most prized possessions. It's a little lengthy on the assembly, and smaller than I expected, but the enjoyment it has brought to him is well worth the price. He asked for my help in building this thing, and it still took several hours to complete. The pieces are small and a little difficult for adult fingers, but otherwise it's a good deal.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|Best show ever. The character development is the best I have seen on any show. Brilliant acting and writing. Must watch show.
B0000CABJ1|5.0|Until I bought this CD, I had forgotten how much I used to love Disco music.  As soon as the CD began playing, I found my foot beating to the music and the singular voice of the queen of Disco, Donna Summer.  Ms. Summer is no longer with us in person, but her voice and music will live on through this remarkable CD.
B009WUBERW|5.0|Tons of action...especially for a bunch of old older men! I loved it! Plot was uneven which kept me wondering...cool!
B004G606K8|5.0|This and the other two books that comprise the three books of the DragonLance Chronicles are some of the best I have read. I fond myself re-reading them every few years or so to relive the story.
0525425772|5.0|the plot line is good<br />the description throughout the story help picture the people and places<br />activities of youth fit what they might do in real life for their area - might not work so well in the major cities<br />have really enjoyed the series
B007PVHMCG|5.0|A very nice Lego toy, perfect for kids, not very expensive, very friendly and exelent present,<br />My boys loved it
B005ZB91KY|4.0|Its ok - they could have done more with the movie - that being said it is very entertaining its enjoyable
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I have been a fan of 007 since a teen, big fan of Daniel Craig.  Skyfall is great movie, so enjoy.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Enjoyed the movie but the quality on of it on my tv was blurry so I was not crazy about that

0312370849|2.0|Sorry the author jumped all over and the last section of the book did not really reflect Sara and her life.  Read it for my book club and they all said just about the same thing.  I think the author could have done much better.  Maybe she should read her own book!<br />Very dark subject and even though it was fiction the author should have checked her facts better.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|LOVE IT ! LIKE IT !want more of it till my ears bleed please.. If you a hard rocking person and this is not in collection you need it in there best rockin band in the world today....:0

B008F9E306|5.0|LOVE THE BEATS and the words it got killer  hooks and everything mix in make a awesome CD!!!!for those who love music
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I saw the movie first, but it was so confusing that I decided to read the book.  I hate to read a book that is poorly written, so I won't finish a poorly written book.  I finished City of Bones.  I would't say it was a great book and I may not read any more of them (I am an adult), but it had developed characters that had real problems and the author left some mysteries.
B005IS565S|5.0|you in bad mood you  or good mood or just went rock out this a killer cd buy it slam in your cd player and your cd player will thank you finaly put something good in it...
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Quick read with an interesting plot development.<br />I was not prepared for the turn the story line took.<br />I would recommend for anyone wanting a fast<br />paced read.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|This is probably the most inspirational book I have ever read. It can literally change your life. And his fun, witty, sometimes sarcastic tone makes it an easy read. He will also give you the book for free if you need it or refund your $ if you prove you have read it. So read it now & be inspired!
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|Formulaic, predictable, and far too much anti-Catholicism that adds little purpose to the story.  I've lost interest in other works from this author.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This product is very easy to install and use.  I can play youtube videos right from my smart phone.  No wires needed anymore!  Thank you!
B00FKSJ3YG|4.0|This is good for TV. The characters are likable and hope to see more development of the characters through the season. Love Coulson, glad he's back what ever the origin. I have read the negative reviews. For those who though they would get something like couple hundred million dollar movie are fooling themselves and to harsh on the show. It is what it is. Hope people are not looking for a major movie experience for each episode, it should make a decent run.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|MY 4YR OLD LOVE PLAYING THIS GAME ALSO ME &HIS FATHER DO TO ITS WORKS VERY GOOD ON OUR AMAZON KINDLE FIRE HD ITS A REALLY GREAT GAME FOR KIDS & ADULTS EVERY ONE SHOULD DOWNLOAD IT IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY DID IT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS GAME ! ! (:
B0093QHWLC|5.0|It was very good and worth seeing.  The story line was easy to keep up with and the surprise ending was emotional.
B00F795VW6|5.0|the elderly people in thestory played a good part . loved the ending. know how they feel. work in a nursi home
B000OHZJLY|5.0|It seems that a lot of people have never heard this CD but I consider it to be one of his best. The All Music Guide gives it a 5 star rating and they're kind of picky. I think it's definitely a must have CD if you are a Costello fan. Actually, even if you're not, you may want to check it out because you will probably be a fan after hearing it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I cannot put it down! An excellent read. My heart breaks for these women. Intelligently written and very suspenseful. Awesome book.
B007SGM084|5.0|I absolutely loved this trilogy! I plan to read it again, very soon! I was glad to have all of the books at the same time.
B00BSN0K1C|5.0|This action figure is very nice, pretty good quality. I have it sitting at my desk at work. I try to resist the urge to pick it up and pretend he is flying around my cube while making sound effects.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I purchased the Chromecast with the intend of turning my flatscreen into an smart tv.<br />I received it yesterday and I was not dissapointed.  It does not turn your tv into a smart<br />tv, however it is the equivalent.  Great buy
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Occasionally, I forget the definition of a word or a don't know a word's meaning. This app is quite helpful.
B009EE6PTS|3.0|The movie has some great action scenes in it that are innovative.  The movie reminds me of a live action Akira watered down as it lacks any real sci-fi.  Overall, its worth a rent.  I don't think I'll be watching it again anytime soon.
140006922X|4.0|wonderful book ,a lot of history which make sense.Easy to read.i will read it again in a while to comprehend it more.
B001DTWJRE|5.0|For Whom the Bell Tolls is perhaps one of the greatest books of the 20th Century. Set in revolutionary Spain about 1933 or so, the book covers less than a week of real time, as American Republican Partisan Robert Jordan assists a band of guerrillas in blowing up a bridge in preparation for a major Republican attack.  Hemingway is a master storyteller, and the weaving of love, life, death, and the horrors and deceit of war are well developed.  You know the ending at the beginning, and yet the development of the story and characters are so rich and so complete that there is little to do but wistfully tear up during the last chapter.  The book is a page turner, and a must read treasure of 20th Century literature.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Nothing change still the best show to watch ....  Keep watching and enjoy the show... So sit back and be prepare to laugh...
B006MW3UZW|5.0|There aren't enough stars for this series about an Earl's family and the souls who serve them.  Be sure to watch the seasons in order, though, so you don't miss any of the stories as they develop.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I almost didn't watch it due to seeing a wrong trailer. This movie is a work of art. It generates a very real feeling of a post apocalypse world with very deep character presentation.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 was just an inspired as Seasons 1 and 2.  I am completed enthralled.  I impatiently await season 4.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|I should have taken the advice of others who bought this DBTech tape to MP3 transfer device.  My advice is don't buy it if you need a quality reproduction of your cassettes.  The device will play your cassette meaning it will produce a sound.  With a good pair of headphones you get a bonus.  You hear the front track being played and you hear the track on the other side of the tape as well.  The digital conversion of the device is sketchy as the mini USB on the device is cheap and you must wiggle it  to maintain good contact.  The Audacity software would not recognize the device.  Expanded user guide provided as a separate PDF document solved the problem.  The device produced a constant hum along with the recording.  Keep a lot of batteries on hand as it does not come with a power cord.  I am returning the product and hope Amazon will refund my money.  True,  it was a cheap price but it should have worked as advertised.
076790592X|5.0|This is a wonderful read.  It makes you really think about the choices and actions one has endowed in their own life.
B005LAII12|4.0|Seth Macfarlane (creator of the iconic show Family Guy, American Dad, The Cleveland Show, etc.) made an even bigger name for himself in 2012. He made a full feature length film that revolves solely around teddy bear. But trust me, this bear ain't nice.<br /><br />TED has a solid reserved cast that includes Mark Wahlberg as John, Mila Kunis as Lori, Patrick Stewart as our narrator, Joel Mchale as Rex, Giovanni Ribsi as the antagonist Donny, and the funny man himself Seth Macfarlane voices TED. There are alao brief appearances from Ryan Reynolds(hahaha again, no comment), the talented singer Norah Jones, and Sam Jones. I liked the cast, the chemistry with Mark and Mila was there, and the humor is outrageous and spot on for the most part.<br /><br />Yes, this movie IS rated R, and no, I would not consider this an ideal movie for kids. There are a lot of jokes that will make a person laugh, then there are a few jokes that will make another person say to his/herself \\"was I supposed to laugh just now?\\" I get that. And I do understand it Again, Seth Macfarlane is recognized for his wild, dubious sense of humor. But even though the humor is extreme, TED still manages to convey the message that best friends should always stick together.<br /><br />For those who have not yet seen TED, there are two things I can guarantee if you decide to watch it: 1) You are going to laugh at some point during this movie 2) If you just so happen to be afraid of thunder, you will never fear it again. TED gets a score of<br /><br />3.5 Stars
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it's so cool because I played it in 6 hower's that is Long right. I love minion Rush I watch the move of it too.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|This is my new best game to play. I have a pinball in my basement and now i can play anywhere. The graphics are great. It is very authentic .

B00D3NSDVO|5.0|One of the best books I have read this year and I look forward to Mr Hayes's next blockbuster.<br />Thank you Terry.
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|I enjoyed the free version so much that I purchased the complete version. Everything loaded correctly and I was able to continue playing...that is, until I loaded it again the next day. I then discovered that not only would the game not load t all, but I had to re-install it. I then was forced to go through the tutorial again because all game progress was lost. I was quite disappointed, as I had three stars on seven levels. I now am playing on level two, working my way through once again. On the plus side, the graphics are great So are the cartoons and voice overs. Be sure to check out their trophy room as there are some pretty obscure and unexpected chances to win trophies...such as changing the card backgrounds. I give this a 4 star rating because of losing my progress.
B0091TGWYE|5.0|I have tried many cases, but decided I wanted my phone to be naked without too much risk of dropping it. This case allows me to do just that. When I'm not actively using it, I can just push it in the pouch. Btw, this case is really sturdy and  made from high quality material. I would definitely recommend to others. Oh, and the customer support is spot on, I received an email following up to make sure that I was pleased with my purchase...and I most definitely am!
B001N3OJEG|5.0|i've always enjoyed this movie, would recommend.  hope to find more movies like this, and classic movies which are my favorite
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Great season that you don't want to miss especially if you've followed the previous seasons .Lots of old and new faces.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|It was in  perfect condition, like new. It arrived much quicker than expected and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Great fun at the beach.
B0042J6VUS|4.0|First off you can not beat the price on this item. I used this with a galaxy nexus which is clearly too big for the holder. After fiddling with it for  a bit I was able to make the phone fit and it worked great.
B00422LESO|5.0|The book was hilarious and the movie...less so.  None the less, I would highly recommend this to my friends...and enemies!
B00CA3C1N4|4.0|Fun game. If you play only agains the A.I, It will keep you occupied for long enough to justify the purchase. I think playing against my friends would ad real lasting value to this game.
B005D6O13S|5.0|I love these shoes they are so comfortable and yet can be worn as casual or dressy.<br />The color is perfect.  Recommend these shoes
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|This game was a good way to spend about 30 min of down time. the concept is really a good one and I liked the game even though the end comes rather quickly
B0097HSS4M|4.0|Nifty little app with some cool features.  Has some editing capabilities but not really what the advanced user would be looking for. It is good for those just sprucing up their pic to look good on facebook or some picture sharing app.
B0045XICB2|5.0|since i watched the first 2, might as well keep watching on a twilight marathon.  story line pretty good for a teen series
B00A3VLJCE|5.0|This app is for the more advanced user that is accustomed to Adope Photoshop. Otherwise, it will be very difficult to figure out all the functions and the tutorials only show so much.  For those that are familiar with Photoshop this is a nifty app for your tablet. Not as in-depth as the pc version but still functions as you would expect it to.

193700788X|4.0|Listened for Fun (Audible)<br />Overall Rating: 4.25<br />Story Rating: 3.75<br />Character Rating: 4.75<br /><br />Audio Rating: 4.00 (not part of the overall rating)<br /><br />SPOILERS AT THE VERY END<br /><br />First Thought When Finished: Thank you Bon Temps and Charlaine Harris for all the good times over the years! You will be missed!<br /><br />NOTE: I realize I am probably in the minority but I actually like how the end scene worked. I thought it held very true to who Sookie Stackhouse was from the beginning. She never wanted to be owned, controlled, or a side character in her own life. Even half way through the series, she was repeating that mantra.....<br /><br />  \\"I want to be first. I know that's selfish, and maybe unattainable, and maybe shallow. But I just want to come first with someone. If that's wrong of me, so be it. I'll be wrong. But that's the way I feel.\\" (Sookie Stackhouse)\\"― Charlaine Harris, From Dead to Worse<br /><br />Story Thoughts: I have always read the Sookie Stackhouse series as a cozy mystery series with urban fantasy elements. She dated far to many men in 13 books for me to ever think of this as an Urban Fantasy with a romance end game. I think maybe that is the reason I had less problems with how the whole \\"romance\\" side of the story worked. I don't want to post spoilers (though I am pretty sure anyone not living under a rock knows) so I will just say that I always wanted her with someone who would put her first, love her for being Sookie (not her blood), and would respect her wishes. There were very few men in this series that actually held any of these attributes but gosh darn it she got to hook up with some hotties. Sookie's dating life had some awesome moments and if she was a scrapbooker--that would be one heck of a colorful memory book! That being said, I did think the mystery element in this entry was lacking and that was disappointing (aka the 3.75 for Story). It had some moments that were great but on a whole it was pretty predictable. I do think it tied up things nicely so that Sookie's life should be able to move forward on her own terms but it wasn't my favorite mystery in this series.<br /><br />Character Thoughts: I love the characters in this series! Not a single one of them is perfect. They all have flaws. They all have humor. They all have loyalties. They all have unlikable character traits. Life experience had an impact on each of them, made them grow, made them more of themselves, and made them all interesting. I adore Bon Temps even when I wasn't quite impressed with the mysteries in certain books, I was always impressed with the people. I am sad to see their journeys come to an end (or at least the ones that I see) but I am glad I got to spend time with them in the first place! In other words, I will miss them but I do think it was time for them to ride off into the sunset, moonlight, or ever after!<br /><br />Audio Thoughts:<br /><br />  Narrated by Johanna Parker/Running Time 10 hrs and 11 mins<br /><br />I really like Johanna Parker's narration of this series. She has a good amount of southern in her (from timing, slow talking, emotion) narration and that just sells me. I will admit that this particular trait will make the narration not work for others. I have listened to the last few of these on audio and wish I would have done so from the beginning.<br /><br />Final Thought: I realize that a LOT (judging by goodreads)of people will whole heartily disagree with me liking this book and in the end that is most wonderful thing about stories. They may never make everyone happy but they will make someone happy. I guess this time it was me :)<br /><br />Read the spoiler if you want to know why this worked for me...<br /><br />[Finally the quote that I think sums up why I didn't get mad when she didn't end up with Eric...<br /><br />\\"Though I was having a blissful moment of being happy and content, I had one of those stray ideas you get at odd moments. I thought,How nice it would be if Eric were here with me in the car. He'd look so good with the wind blowing his hair, and he'd enjoy the moment . Well, yeah, before he burned to a crisp.<br />But I realized I'd thought of Eric because it was the kind of day you wanted to share with the person you cared about, the person whose company you enjoyed the most. And that would be Eric as he'd been while he was cursed by a witch: the Eric who hadn't been hardened by centuries of vampire politics, the Eric who had no contempt for humans and their affairs, the Eric who was not in charge of many financial enterprises and responsible for the lives and incomes of quite a few humans and vampires. In other words, Eric as he would never be again.\\" ― Charlaine Harris, Definitely Dead<br /><br />I called it about book 6 that she would either end up with Sam or start a relationship with him. He was the only man through out the whole series that pretty much stuck by her no matter what. They were best friends and I am a sucker for friends to lovers storylines. I don't think it was the most romantic of endings and I am not sure if it will work out forever. Her relationship with Eric was HAWT (when it worked), ANNOYING (when he would lord over her), and UNPREDICTABLE (when he battled centuries of wanting power/control and she was being independent). Quinn was probably the only other guy I could have seen her with long term but even then I thought he might be to Alpha for Sookie too. She was very independent (stubbornly so) and long term I just didn't see her staying with someone that would challenge her every single day. Do I think Sam is Beta? In some ways, YES. I do think he has Alpha qualities (he is a provider, business owner, loyal, dependable) but he doesn't feel the need to control everything. I think his lone shifter mode perhaps made his personality more compatible long term with Sookie. At least in my mind. Will it be her hottest relationship? Nope that will always be Eric. Will it be her most stable one? I think so. I am sure that I was more #TeamStableGuy for long term Sookie because he could be with her in the sun. That was her favorite place to be and something none of her vampires could do. In the end, I didn't want anyone to change who they were. If Sookie gave in to Eric wanting to make her vampire--it would change her. If Eric gave in to her wanting him out of Vampire politics---it would have changed him. This is why this story worked for me but probably not for others that wanted the romantic ending that love will conquer all. I am sad that it was so disappointing for others and that the backlash has been so big. Though it is a huge investment and I can understand the passion behind the outcry. Books are made to bring out emotions and this one did that even if it wasn't an outpouring of love. Our time with Bon Temps is over (at least in print) but maybe for those that didn't get the ending you wanted here---you might get it on the show (where I am not rooting for Sam at all--talk about a character they have changed). There is always hope for you there :)e it would be if Eric were here with me in the car. He'd look so good with the wind blowing his hair, and he'd enjoy the moment .

B003G4W49C|5.0|A fast paced, intelligent, thought provoking novel about a child thrust into a world most adults would not handle. It presents interesting ethical situations, paradoxes, and social commentary, interwoven amongst a gripping plot and moving character development. It was a great read, and I am certainly looking forward to reading the next book in the series.

B00CL68NOG|4.0|I am a Barbra fan from way back so factor that into the review.  I am also a Jewish mother with grown sons who could empathize with the joy that a mom might feel in taking a trip with her baby.  I found the film entertaining if some what predictable but, I don't always want a movie to expand my intellectual capacities.  It didn't but I liked it anyway
630469878X|4.0|This film is about a friendship between two women and their respective relationships with men. What starts out as a fun vacation goes wrong in so many ways. Susan Sarandon who is the older of the two women plays kind of an older sister part as the two start out on a road trip in a convertible. First they stop at a roadhouse to dance & have a few drinks and the trouble starts, then they pick up a &#34;hitchhiker&#34; (Brad Pitt) and he steals their money. It all goes downhill from there. Tommy Lee Jones keeps trying to resolve the situation but the girls keep making bad decisions. I did not care for the ending which is why it got 4 instead of 5 stars. The acting was really very good.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Excellent book.  I read it for a book club and I was so glad to have done that.  The book was written during the time of slavery and I usually don't enjoy reading that time period and how the \\"masters\\" treated their slaves.  And then during our meeting we got to talk to the author and ask her many questions.  I was impressed with the author and her story.  I would recommend this book to my friends and have.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I needed to replace my Kindle Fire cable. I ordered this one, came quickly and works on my Kindle Fire.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I have played similar puzzle games that are based on old Japanese logic puzzles. This one is fun, the sound and music is pleasant. I like the interface. It is very easy to play. I also like that it has 3 difficulties for each puzzle.<br /><br />The only con to this game is that the hardest difficulty is still fairly easy, with a 15 x 15 puzzle box and only one color for the squares. Other games of the same type have more complicated puzzles.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|We have read every Stephen King novel to date, even though we dislike as many as we like - so we guess we won't quit till he does (if ever!). We found this 850-page tome, like \\"Under the Dome\\", likable - but too long. It has a great premise that kept us hooked: set in the year 2011, a man travels through a time portal back to 1958, having been shown the portal by a man who wants JFK's assassin Lee Oswald killed in order to change history and allow JFK to live, hopefully avoiding Viet Nam and who knows what else. And so our leading man, English teacher Jake Epping, indeed goes back under an assumed name, and proceeds to stop some other calamities en route to working on the Oswald matter. For those of us who lived through the period in question, there was plenty of nostalgia to enjoy, as King works in old slang, old products, cars, and songs of the period, etc. The details about Oswald got a little boring and caused the mid-book to slow down considerably, although Epping's love affair with a librarian at a school where he got a job (he had to be back there for several years to get up to the key date of 11/22/63 {hence the title}) helped spice things up.<br /><br />So we can't complain that we weren't entertained - but we're not sure we were so enchanted with the final outcome that our investment of many many reading hours got an appropriate return!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Powerfully poignant and hopeful glimpse at mere mortals learning to live and love while staring premature mortality in the face. Never cease to be amazed by the power of the human spirit.
B00204AA0O|5.0|Regina Spektor is one of the most gifted musicians I have ever heard - hands down. The woman can play piano marvelously, she can mimic virtually any accent or singer, and has a marvelous flair for storytelling. Two of my favorite pieces off of this album are \\"Eet\\" and \\"Dance Anthem of the 80s.\\" They are catchy, poetic and really interesting. There aren't words in the English vocabulary to describe how other worldly this woman's music is. She is not a folk singer. She is not a punk singer. She is not a classical pianist per se (though she has classical piano training). This is a great introduction to Regina Spektor's music for newcomers and a great follow up for her lifelong fan base.
B00005JLF5|5.0|I would recommend DS9 to any Trekker fan who seriously wants to view star trek from a different perspective of living on a space station instead of roaming the galaxy in a star ship. Characters are more intimate and intriguing which the viewer will find enjoyable. .
B007MDQW3W|5.0|This 2012 follow up by Regina Spektor is wonderful, humorous and even interplanetary. We go on a quest with Ms. Spektor as she takes us on a tour of a museum (\\"All the Rowboats\\"), a mafia family (\\"Oh Marcello\\"), Paris (\\"Don't Leave Me (Ne Me Quitte Pas)\\"), and a whole slew of other places, faces and mindsets. The piano has never sounded better, Regina is top notch, vocally speaking, and her jokes and platitudes are fast, furious, ironic and even sexy. Love this woman. Love her unique and visionary creative path.
B008LVCKH6|5.0|All the things I like in a good book. Smart, funny, great language, historical interest.<br />And it is very original.
B0038AUY96|5.0|I have read  all the previous books in the Harry Hole series and have moved on to the next one which is The Leopard. Jo Nesbo is a brilliant author and these books are so full of suspence and so totally unpredictable. I have not yet to solved  any of these crimes until the end. Great reading.
1577314808|5.0|This book is written for the average person, easy to understand and powerful in its message.  I have already recommended it to friends!
B008S7EPXA|5.0|This is quickly becoming one of my favorite albums. The sound is much of what a person might expect from Dead Can Dance, giving the listener a fresh, deeply musical experience. The only thing missing was a somber solo track from Lisa Gerard.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I'm addicted to these, but the ones made specifically for tablets that have the 20 x  20 boards are the best. The 15 x 15 boards are not as challenging.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|Great! Fun! Exciting!.... Great entertainment . The cinematograhy  and special effects  were.... Well out of this world! No pun intended!!! Even if you weren't a Star Trek fan.., you'll love this movie!!!
B002HFJ77S|5.0|Sophie Kinsella never disappoints. Her stories are so funny, clever, and heartfelt. Twenties Girl is a quirky and fun read.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a great app for Kindle fire!<br />It has lots of fun, challenging puzzles!<br />Game play: solve the flip pix puzzles* to unlock objects for the pictures.<br />5x5, 10x10, or 15x15 are the sizes of the puzzle.
B0042816YK|1.0|I didn't receive the dvd. So I can't rate it.I ordered it twice and received a copy that wouldn't play both times. There is nothing wrong with my dvd player and it has never occurred with any other dvd.

B00EVVAXQU|3.0|When it has came down to Paul McCartney and his delightful music, he has been one of the most definitive singer/songwriters in the music industry. But every so often an artist can make a song that isn't to the fullest of the caliber of the voice as well. That is the case with New, Paul McCartney's latest single. The song isn't exactly his one of his better songs. While it is simple and short, it actually isn't as strong as was the case with the songs from his last album Memory Almost Full with Dance Tonight and Ever Present Past. While the song is at least better than all the junk music that is on radio right now, more could've actually been in there to be with his standards, and with his works fro Wings and The Beatles. Still, more could've been new to this song.<br /><br />Song: C+
B000I55YV2|5.0|I thought it would be a good movie, but I stopped watching when the safe landed in the boat..cmon..that safe woulda went right thru.<br />kinda killed it for me<br /><br />hahahaha oh dang...I started the movie again and its all cool...<br /><br />I love it...
1400031524|5.0|Having heard so much about Baiba in later Kurt Wallander books it's good to get to know her, and she is, somewhat to my surprise, an innocent, fragile person, but by no means helpless.  This story is loaded with action, violence and cliffhanging danger--with many scenes of genuinely threatening, potentially lethal peril to both Kurt and Baiba.  &#34;The Dogs of Riga&#34; would make a fantastic film!  I have a friend from Latvia, and will give her a copy for Christmas.  Since she, too, tells horrific stories of the Stalinist legacy of ruling commissars, I expect the perils of the plot will strike some responsive chords.  Politically both of us are left-liberals, definitely not right-wing anarchists and followers of violent talk show hosts.  I'm a Socialist.  I can't imagine anyone except a rigid Fascist wanting to be ruled by a wealthy, power-crazed oligarchy, spied upon by the government, jailed without habeas corpus for revealing unconstitutional activities, and slandered for wanting justice and peace--which seems to be the way our own country has been going since at least 1981, and why both my friend and I are political, social and economic activists.  And it's why (although the NeoCons complained) the Soviet and other Soviet bloc reformers of the late 1980s and 90s--the period of this novel--were universally referred to as &#34;liberals&#34;.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I'm addicted to playing and now have my granddaughter addicted. Very fast paced with lots of goals to beat. Don't like that you have to spend $ to be very competitive. It would be a big plus if all the bananas you gain can be traded in for tokens for us folks (and kids) on a limited budget.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's good but it is struggling it's pretty hard but it's very fun it's a git better buy it .
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Of course Season One was great. Every season of Breaking Bad was great!  I am a die hard fan of the show and will miss future episodes on the telly.  All good things must come to an end, especially if Heisenberg has run out of time.

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|E Squared is the most informative book about using your thoughts to create your reality.  It should be required reading simply because it is so fun to read.  Even young children can do the experiments, and will probably be more successful than their parents!  Get this book!  IT is wonderful!!!!
0375703764|4.0|Presenting the different narrators through vastly different writing styles and text arrangement is refreshing and innovative.  The arrangement of text on the page to represent the message conveyed is interesting.  Students loved it.  One narrator is inappropriate for high school readers, but I would definitely use this in a freshman comp class.
B007KAJG3K|4.0|This is a good movie with a plot that makes you have to think, yes, some of the stuff is stupid and childish.  But that is what the movie is about.
B007KW5MFE|5.0|This a good old vampire movie that like vampires never gets old, basically it is about a vampire hunter ( Wesley Snipes ) that is trying to get revenge for past trauma that was inflected on him, Deacon Frost (Steven Dwarf) is a sadist and charming vampire that wants to conquer the human race he is also the nemesis of Blade. Another thing that I like about this film is, it shows the lifestyle of vampires and some of the businesses that they are involved in. Whistler ( Kris Kristofferson) is Blades partner, a man who has been hunting vampires longer then Blade, he also has his personal reasons why he hunts the &#34;nocturna&#34; as he calls them. I love the modern customs that they wear in this film. This is my first review that I have ever done... I hope that you enjoy the movie and my review.
