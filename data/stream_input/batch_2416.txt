B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|Get your pillow and cot out you'll need it for this sleeper. Don't remember Bilbo running around with an army from the books, but then I don't remember reading The Hobbit other than children versions.  Why would you run around with an army that is being hunted, especially since one of the members has a hit called on him.  Makes for long days.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|This was not one of my favourite books and I hated the ending.the book just wasn't keeping my attention boring
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book kept me on my toes the whole time.  I read the book so fast I was wanting to find the end. I want a sequel.  The author has really outdone it with this story.  Plot twists, turns, and more suspense then you can handle.  Gillian Flynn has a great story here.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book was decent worthy enough to finish, but doesn't grab your attention right out of the gate. Give it a chance it might surprise you.
B004NS710C|4.0|Great pulse pounding action, terrifically-filmed action sequences, and a great film for a family popcorn and movie night.  The acting by the leads is good, too.  Much better than the critics gave them credit for.  That said, the screenplay lacks depth, and the GAPING plot holes and inconsistencies become very obvious on the second and subsequent viewings.  SPOILER ALERT  The control levers moving by themselves bothered me even on the first time through -- in the real incident, the engineer set the controls in the wrong position -- because the controls have detents to prevent that from happening.  The (fictional) town of Stanton became the largest city in Pennsylvania after Philly (much larger than either Pittsburgh or Allentown), and train and locomotive braking systems are improperly represented: they need air to hold them off, not to apply them like a truck.  This last detail, while it may not be as obvious to non-train buffs, still begs the question: if you're going to be down between the locos monkeying with coupler pins, why not just hook up the air lines (althought you would really need to OPEN the air cock and bleed off the air to stop the train), and finally, diesel electric locos like the ones in the movie generate a set amount of tractive effort in each throttle setting.  If you add weight or drag, the loco slows down.  Period.  It's not cruise control.  END SPOILERS.  Still, in spite of problems with the plot, it's a really entertaining movie and well worth seeing.  And BTW, if you're wondering about the dedication, the film is dedicated to the wife of the man who ran down the real runaway (Crazy Eights --CSX SD40-2 #8888), and Denzel Washington's agent, both of whom died while the film was in production.
B004EK6ZZQ|5.0|I love the Step Up series and Moose (Adam) is a great addition to these films! The struggle and vvicory is inspiring and it draws you in quickly.

B007FG9LIE|4.0|What an unexpected surprise.  I really enjoyed the wtf-ness feeling this book have me as I read.  The tip of the author's hat to Twin Peaks was a nice acknowledgment, and that's all you need to know before you start reading!

Such an incredible story of heroism on the front lines in Afghanistan, what the SEAL teams go through during training, and the brotherhood that is the Navy SEAL's is such an eye opener.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book was very difficult to read in parts.  The parts I had trouble with were those depicting the cruelty to the children.  The way this all came to be at the end was worth hanging on.  The author do did an amazing j o b.

B00B4804KS|5.0|One of my favorite movies just got better.  I don't get some critics of this movie.  I thought it was a very good movie and held my interest throughout. The science may be flawed but it was believable in the context of the movie in my opinion.<br /><br />Watching it at home in 3d was a real treat.  The 3d is excellent with great depth. While I know this movie and just about every line, I enjoyed like it was the first time I saw it because of the 3d format.<br /><br />A few words about Universal Blu Rays discs.  They are huge pain in the you know where.  If you put it on pause for more than few minutes, a Universal screen saver comes on.  No problem with that, but you can't restart the movie where you left off. The same is true if you push the stop button, you have to start the movie over and go through the menus.  This was so even with the old HDDVD discs, but only with Universal.  The picture and sound were pristine.<br /><br />This 3d version is expensive.  Wait a few weeks and it will be around 20.00 just like Titanic.<br /><br />Jerry
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Les Miserables<br />A like it though the descriptions of rooms and furnitures are excessive. It was the way of writing at that time
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|First, be sure to understand that this is a novella.  Not too long.  But long enough to provide a full and excellent story.  The story moves along at a nice pace.  The entire story is told from Shai's point of view, but it works nicely.  Through her, we learn about all the others.  But, as a Forger, we learn to trust her insights and understanding of others.  Well done.

0307744434|5.0|This story was very unique and indeed, spell binding.  The writer allowed you to see this magic circus and get to know the main characters enough to get interested in their next move.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. I just LOVE  it. It's just awesome and amazing. I like how it's also a mystery and a thriller at the same time. I think it's really cool.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|I read about this story while in school, but wanted to find out how it all happened. Movie is ok, watchable one time.
0307730697|3.0|I learned some things about the seals, but this effort seemed like a eulogy, rather than a novel. Worth reading, but just barely.

B007MB5OCE|4.0|Fun critique of the last century's history. An interesting protagonist, a nicely built character.<br />Sometimes, a little to slow-paced for my taste. All in all, a good book.

B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|love this game. only flaw is you have to buy coins once you get so far to upgrade. otherwise its a great game
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book is predictable and dull. I hope her other books are better. I am disappointed but will give this author another shot.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game you can create awesome things like people and giraffes all that good stuff. I have no dislike for it. I would recommend it to people who are creative.
B004132HZS|4.0|OK, so purists may not like it because it takes place in modern times.  OK so, as I've seen from scanning a few of the low rating reviews, there are some nitpickers out there who want to dissect everything just to prove their esoteric knowledge makes them superior.  But if you have an open mind, and more than just a little knowledge of Sherlockiana, you might just enjoy the series.<br /><br />I personally loved trying to catch all the references to the various original Holmes stories.  And the updating of the time period made some of the references cute.  New twists to the old plots were good too.  And, sorry, but I did find all three episodes entertaining, not just the first one.<br /><br />Holmes is a bit young (or rather the actor who plays him is), but the character is one you can be interested in.  He seems a bit off, not entirely in touch with the usual niceties of polite society, something I never really noticed in the Doyle stories, but something I recognized as (maybe) having been inspired by the American TV show \\"Monk\\".<br /><br />Watson seems always on the verge of just ditching Holmes and his quirks altogether.  In fact, he seems to get annoyed with Holmes more often than not, but that is primarily due to Holmes' obsessive single-mindedness, another thing that the writers seem to have added to this variation.<br /><br />The fact that the writers chose to not make the Lestrade character a blithering idiot (as the Basil Rathbone versions did) was also a point I liked.  Lestrade here is often annoyed, but you can detect the respect he has for Holmes.<br /><br />OK, so the Jeremy Brett series from a few years back was better, but I'm always keen to try out new things, and this series is definitely worth checking out.  It made for a nice weekend spent inside.  Looking forward to watching the 2nd season very soon.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|If anything is wrong with this App. its that its to easy to use and spend money. Easy to search or what you want and easy to pay.<br />  I have not tried to sell anything yet so can't say anything to that.
B009DT9ANW|5.0|I went to one of the FCS 35 shows, and I wanted to be able to relive the show over and over.  This is a great representation of the tour that I had witnesses first hand.
B00BFUC8RC|4.0|My grandson loves to play this game. Not only is it fun to watch the rollercoaster go around the track, but the sounds it makes it really cute.  It also asks for more money to play different sets, but you can still keep playing if you don't want to buy anything else.
B00782O7IY|5.0|A gift for my parents, with whom I first watched it (they're in their late 80s, now); so evocative of early films & film making. We all loved it.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|My husband rented \\"The Sessions\\" last night and initially I balked at watching it. A severely disabled man's yearning to experience intimacy, his confessions to his Catholic parish priest, and his intimate sessions with his sex surrogate just seemed a tad weird for me, but it was a slow night and I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />I am immensely glad I did because this movie proved to be an immensely engaging viewing experience. Yes, the very subject nature of the film makes it one of those awkward movies, and there is certainly a fair amount of frank and explicit discourse on sex, the main character expounding on his sexual angst and yearnings, and of course some explicit sexual situations. Yet, the movie is grounded and credibly portrays the main character's struggles to come into his own, to claim his manhood and to learn how to have a satisfying sexual relationship.<br /><br />John Hawkes plays a 38-year-old severely disabled writer, Mark O'Brien, who needs to be in an iron lung for most of his waking hours. Overcome by a desperate need to experience sexual intimacy (he can't even masturbate, but is capable of achieving a full erection), Mark decides to confess his yearnings to his parish priest, Father Brendan, played by William H. Macy, who acts as his confessor/confidante. Mark eventually hooks up with sex surrogate Cheryl, played by Helen Hunt, and this is where the movie truly takes off. Each scene between Mark and Cheryl packs an emotional wallop, their interactions coming across as credible and poignant as they gently navigate the awkwardness of the situation - Cheryl playing the role of the experienced tutor/therapist/surrogate who gently guides Mark from learning the essentials of foreplay to actual intercourse. It sounds so clinical putting it here in writing, but their on-screen chemistry makes it appear these two individuals are not merely playing a part but are the characters they inhabit.<br /><br />It is a revelation of a film, and its frank portrayal of sex and the disabled is to be commended. It would not have been something I would have chosen to watch, but now that I have, I'm glad I did. The main cast does an amazing job with Hawkes delivering an Oscar-worthy performance (he is definitely turning out to be a great character actor), and Hunt is as always a magnetic presence on screen (she does bare all for this role). The secondary characters did well too - William H. Macy does a credible job in his role as father confessor/confidante and Moon Bloodgood as Vera, Mark's able aide who develops a soft spot for him.<br /><br />Far from being depressing and bizarre, I actually thought \\"The Sessions\\" was thought-provoking, honest, and grounded, not to mention entertaining. Recommended for those willing to watch something unusual and willing to try a film not within their usual comfort zone.portrayal of sex and the disabled is to be commended.

B009MYAQK4|5.0|Reading this book was so interesting to me.  The basic message is very similar to other books I've read. The author tells us that we must learn how to love one another, hmmmmm...sounds familiar.  I will probably read more of his books!!
B004J64QSI|4.0|If you enjoyed the movie released this last year, you know the depth of emotion the story can stir.  This DVD does the same thing with music.  You will find yourself humming the tunes and flashing back to moments where the score touches something deep within.  Well done.
1451696191|3.0|Perhaps if I'd read this before instead of after seeing the movie I would have liked it better. It is a good book, delving into several difficult subjects (childhood sexual abuse, date abuse, abortion, homosexuality, high school drinking & abusive sex) and the importance of friends, caring & supportive adults, facing the truth, and personal strength. One of the very few times I will say the movie is better than the book.
B008C20TDG|4.0|I saw several pins on Pinterest and became interested in Whole30. The book makes sense and is very easy to understand.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great horse game, I wish they had more animal games like this, I wish that there were more games for tablets with graphics like this game... I love it!
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I was quite surprised and so was my husband, that the songs were as good as they were.  Many of them are old style blues songs and they are done quite well for an Englishman.  The guest singers are also good.  Also bought these as gifts for Hugh Laurie fans.
B00AFEY354|4.0|When I first saw this movie, I called all my children and grandchildren and told them to watch this. I saw it again and it didn't resonate quite so much. It is well made, well told, with fine, nuanced, believable characters. It is one of the few movies I've seen that is actually better than the fine book it is based on.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Recommend by my sister for different running styles. Interesting story, definitely learned a thing or two. Good for non runners too.
B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|This film is going to be considered the most important story our generation will ever tell. It received horrible reviews, why that is I will never know. Inspired story telling, incredible acting, and visually stunning, Cloud Atlas is a masterpiece that one day will hopefully gain the respect it is due. This will be one of the most important movies you will ever witness. You are doing yourself a massive disservice if you miss this one, folks.
B009P3N1GI|5.0|I went in, not expecting very much, but the &#34;magic system&#34; with the stamps convinced me to stay for the whole journey, and I'm happy I did. It's one of the few novellas that made me consider the morality of what was going on, the implications. It's a wonderful read and if you got to this novella from Mistborn you won't be disappointed.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Wow! This is an extremely hard puzzle game to master, but when you solve one of the many puzzles this box holds, it actually feels like you have achieved something. There is a help system employed, but it doesn't give you the complete answer to each puzzle (and there are many!). Cudos to whoever designed this box. It is truly exceptional.
B005HEK3JW|5.0|I really enjoy this season's offerings - I love both Darmok (the Epic of Gilgamesh is highly underrated!) and the Inner Light (that flute music!) episodes.  The Spock episodes are interesting, too, and it's nice to tie in old and new in a few others.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|First - I love the author's name, \\"Ransom Riggs.\\"  It is a perfectly quirky name for an author who wrote a very quirky book.<br /><br />Partly what got my attention when I decided to read this book were the pictures included in the preview.  I have always loved looking at old family photographs and trying to imagine the feelings, events and shared conversations by the people in the pictures.  Old pictures interest me especially because they have helped me to connect to my past and my ancestors like nothing else could...<br /><br />The book itself is a fun read and the pictures only drive home even more the images created in the mind by the author's narration of the story.<br /><br />My only negative is the end... I was not expecting it to end when it did.  I felt like I was left hanging.  Which, I guess, is good for the author because now I can not wait until the sequel comes out in 2014.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|If you love Downton Abbey then this is definitely worth the money. I love owning it and being able to watch it whenever I want. Definitely recommend!

0374531269|5.0|A Long Way Gone, Memoirs of a Boy Soldier follows the story of Ishmael Beah who was introduced to war at the young age of twelve in his native, Sierra Leone. After narrowly escaping a rebel attack on his village, Ishmael finds himself having to adapt to new conditions put on by the attacks in order to survive. After being taken in by soldiers, he is trained to kill, and heavily sedated with drugs such as marijuana and cocaine to further commit them to their new cause. Ishmael senses as his childhood is taken from his as he is forced into his new role as a child soldier. Eventually Ishmael loses his sense of humanity, and feelings of compassion and mercy are extracted from his character, transforming him into a killing machine. The story continues to follow Ishmael as he is taken from his military base to the city of Freetown. Ishmael describes how difficult it is for him to adopt a life free of war and violence after being severely brainwashed to enjoy killing.<br /><br />Although there are points where the story is incredibly difficult to read, I would definitely encourage others to read A Long Way Gone. Ishmael writes with incredible detail, and captivates you with the difficult journey he had to take in order to survive. It really opens your eyes to the tragic events that take place far away from our own homes. I was somewhat aware of the conditions due to the popularity of Invisible Children and \\"KONY 2012\\" but this memoir provided a more graphic and explicit look at how horrible things really are. It is important for us to acknowledge these issues and become educated on them in order to prevent them from affecting future generations.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Haven't had a chance to really get into the meat of the book. However, seems like a good book to read.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|A guilty pleasure for those who enjoy British period drama. Unlike US soap opera stuff, story moves at a nice pace.
B00785P2QC|3.0|the building upgrades  are way to expensive.  I cant upgrade any buildings.  just vechicles.  at least they did not put a limit on buildings
B008602KQI|4.0|I must say I was lured into this movie not so much for its originality(a better version of the running man perhaps?), but for the absolute design and execution of the picture. Well done!
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book the first of Kevin Hearne's but definitely not the last.  It tells of Atticus O'Sullivan, a two thousand year old Druid, who looks like a 21 yr. old college boy.  His lawyers are two vampires and he's friends with a werewolf pack and, oh yeah, he can mentally talk with his Irish wolfhound (who is usually begging for sausages and French poodles).  An old god has been chasing him for centuries to get a sword that Atticus took from him in an ancient war.  There's action, magic and humor in this book and I'd highly recommend it.  Can't wait to start reading the next one of his.
B005NQ94KS|3.0|I like the book because it has more details. There are a lot of nice details missing from the movie.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Just as things got exciting at the end, streaming quality took a nose dive.  I haven't had problems with this in the past, but it was particularly annoying for this movie.  Otherwise, movie was entertaining, picture & sound were good when they were good.

B004SIIBGU|3.0|hard to find your way around, great for a quick check of items though. Cannot check ebay messages. otherwise ok
B005HEF8OC|4.0|This is not your typical Star Trek, but I do enjoy it. Learning tome of the history is fun and enlightening. I especially Kiel how they show the struggle over what we should and shouldn't do and how to handle situations with other people on other planets. This is new to them and they show that well.
B005MQW5RI|3.0|Read a lot of good reviews and thought this would be comparable to Monsters, Inc, or Despicable Me.  In my opinion, this just didn't have the moments that those movies did.  Will Ferrell is funny as always but I don't think I laughed out loud more than once the entire movie.  3D-wise, also not the best - of course, I had just watched Madagascar 3 right before this which is the king of 3D cartoons so that didn't help.  Would probably not watch this movie again because it just didn't have anything memorable to me.
B008MM9630|4.0|Fun little game to play when you are just sitting around.<br />It has its problems such as crashing every now and then and that you can only play solo for so long. But all in all it's entertaining.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|You have to watch the whole thing, past the actual play to really get a great treat! Everyone was AWESOME and hand picked by Webber for their roles in this production.
B0041KKYGU|5.0|As a retired school teacher, I can attest to the reality; this is remarkably like my school experience...someone created this movie who knows the ins-and-outs of the profession!
B001G8XON0|5.0|While lots of people seem to dislike this movie for various reasons, we really enjoyed it and will definitely watch it again. If you just want to watch something that's got a touch of everything (humor, tragedy, high-energy musical numbers, etc.) then this is a good choice.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|GG's identity was completely unexpected....a nice twist!  Too bad it had to be a short season of only ten episodes.
B008BU70HW|5.0|This book is a perfect blend of real historical data coupled with the great story of the series. For anyone who loves the show this book is a must have.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I won't pretend I have even the slightest notion as to the authors intent but if it was to entertain it was an outstanding success. If even 1/100th of this novel is factual, and according to the Internet it is, woe be it to the poor North Korean people's. If Mr Johnson's purpose was to make the reader grateful for being a citizen of the USA then kudos for a job well done. It's always easy to make fun of a dictator but Iam old enough to remember what a clown people thought Hitler was. And history tells us how that turned out, and yet, hard as it is to belive, there are still those that belive he had it right.
B004SIP7S0|4.0|There is enough female nudity in the film as to make one uncomfortable if watching it with family members. This could have been reduced while lengthening the film by adding more &#34;scenes&#34; of Frida's life. I loved the music!
B003K16P3M|5.0|This book does a great job of presenting a bare knuckles adventure story with a compelling emphasis on the emotional motivations of the lead.  My daughter read me the first three chapters out loud and I was hooked.
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|Absolutely gorgeous. I find I can relax and meditate listening to these two incredible young people. Can't wait to hear more from them.
B002ZG99TA|4.0|My son has watched this movie over 50 times (literally) and still enjoys it as much as the first time. There is not and nudity or swearing. Human violence is kept to a minimum. It kills a hour and half of time, what more could you ask for?
1451650728|5.0|I haven't bought a Star Trek: The Next Generation book for more than four years because they killed off my favorite character, Data.He's not exactly the same Data as he was before. This is a great series of three books, and I look forward to buying the Star Trek: The Next Generation books again!
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Started a little slow for me.  I was getting board with the OCD checking the locks.  But eventually I got into it and understood her fear and why she did all the checking.  The story was totally believable and it kind of made you understand why some women stay in abusive relationships and how they can be difficult to get out of.
B000JSI7BM|5.0|I like every actor and actress working here. Anna Hathaway is great. And every person here do their jobs very well.  I like to see it again and again. I like it  so much.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Such a heartbreaking,serious study of an Irish farmer who's tragic childhood leads him to look for a wife to shed his loneliness.The book is filled with rich descriptions and humor.I enjoyed it thoroughly.
0743200799|5.0|This is a fantastic book. You want to keep reading and reading and asking for more. I actually met the author Gene Kranz and had him sign it. HIGHLY recommend the book
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Funny, sad, thoughtful, edgy, clever, and i can go on.. but that's only for Quinton.. The cast is all that and even more !! and if this fim never recieves and award. It will go down as an classic all-time film. Watched @ least 3-4 times by all walks of life. It's just that good. I wish i would have betted on this film. I'd be rich.  A few of my favorite lines.<br /><br />\\"It's a N!&*# on a horse\\"...LMAO<br />wait..<br />\\"what's that uppity MF N%&*&% doin on that yeh horse?  Who's this MF think he is?\\" !!.. LMAO<br /><br />Oh!  \\"It's me Baby\\"  yeah boy..  i took that home with me...<br /><br />This movie is only for the loose hearted person who can take a kick or two in the intelectual pants and can enjoy art, with a little truth, with a dash of fiction.. and have a ton of laughs and cheers.  you will enjoy this film.  Hat's off to the ENTIRE CAST of DJANGO UNCHAINED.  BRAVO !!!!
B004GHNIRK|3.0|It has taken me nearly a month to read this book.  I read it in HS in French.  I spent the time translating it and did not get the story.  Lots of history. but it just dragged on  and on.
B004KPLVW2|5.0|This movie is very good and having it on blue ray is great.  My husband loves this movie and the second Tron Legacy.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I chose this Charge Case because I'm on the road frequently during the day and wanted a way to keep my Plantronics Voyager Legend charged between frequent usage.<br /><br />The charge case worked for two weeks without having to be re-charged.  This, in itself, is a minor miracle as far as I'm concerned.  I like the weight (specifically, the lack of weight) of the charge case.<br /><br />So far, I have yet to discover a downside of this product.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What can I say but WOW!! I was totally blown away by this book and I loved every detail about it! There were so many emotions that came over me and I could not put the book down!! Beginning with the first chapter, you get an insight into Sky and how she flips out, but we don't know the reason why, so I made my own assumptions as to where the story was heading. Boy was I off base!!  Chapter 2 goes back two months and we don't find out for some time as to the reasons for Sky's emotional behaviour.<br /><br />Sky is an amazing character but has lived a sheltered life being homeschooled and is excited with beginning her senior year at a public school. What she didn't expect was that she would already have a reputation because of her association with her best friend Six, who is conveniently leaving on a foreign exchange program. All the nights of letting a guy into her room to make out have come back to haunt her.<br /><br />Sky is detached from her feelings, nothing seems to bother her. All the notes and whispers don't affect her in the slightest way. She does make a new friend on her first day and when she is at the supermarket, she gazes into the eyes of a boy that makes her heart skip, which is amazing because that has never happened before.<br /><br />Holder (Dean) is known as a bit of a bad boy and I knew I was going to love him and boy do I ever. The more he revealed, the deeper I fell for him. He is a bit confusing for Sky, but when she learns the bigger picture she is able to understand him better. He is gorgeous but their initial meeting becomes quite awkward. Sky doesn't understand him at all, but they seem to keep running into each other.<br /><br />There are some skeletons that are revealed from both Sky and Holder's pasts and although it is hard for them in the beginning they are able to turn to each other for support. It wasn't easy at first, but this couple can work past their initial feelings to help one another.<br /><br />Hopeless took my breath away!! It was an emotional journey for both of the characters. There were some times my ribs started to hurt from some of the quirky things that happened and other times where I was rendered speechless as we hit some low points in the book, to find out things could get worse. It was a beautiful book and it is amazing to know that there are people out there who have been through something like this and have been able to move past it. You must read this book, so you know no matter what happens, you don't have to feel Hopeless.It was an emotional journey for both of the characters.

B004K4IZ3G|5.0|Like I've said with the last review on Tron Classic.  My husband loves the movies.  I'd forgotten to mention this I'd purchased both movies and I recieved them earlier then expected.  Thumbs up!
B005HGZVEM|5.0|I love this cd, he is one of my all time favorites.  I love the fact that it was recorded at Sun Studios in Memphis.
0385536828|5.0|I have to begin this review with an admission: I have never liked \\"Atonement\\", the book that was a great success for the author, and which became a successful movie as well. I found it kind of boring and too long. On the other hand I did like his much shorter \\"On Chesil Beach\\". That one was a pleasure to read, mainly because it told a story in a masterful way and in the right amount of words.<br /><br />\\"Sweet Tooth\\" I have loved as well, even though at the beginning I felt reluctant to dive into its world. I guess that had to do with my distrust of the big newspaper critics who are willing to hail every book as a masterpiece once its author is of McEwan's fame and caliber. I'm so glad that I was proven wrong, and that I did get to read this novel. It is a masterpiece. I'm not saying that it's the best fiction book I've ever read, but it is one of the best I have read this year.<br /><br />This is a story of lovers and spies, and of writers and politicians, in a highly charged era of the European history. We meet the heroes in London in the early seventies. The cold war is going strong, the people feel insecure, and the propaganda, or mind games are at their peak. It is under these circumstances that a young and seemingly brilliant woman is recruited by the British secret service. At first she has nothing much to do, she's a paper pusher, but one day her luck will change and she'll be given a mission, to help an author promote her country's interests.<br /><br />What ensues is an adventure, with not too much action, but with a lot of ups and downs. As the reader will soon come to understand most of the actors in this drama are more or less sad, and they are mostly ignorant: \\"Everyone knew as much as they needed to know to be happy,\\" we read, but yet that happiness eluded them.<br /><br />If it wasn't for the author's beautiful prose and the final twist that takes the reader by surprise this would be a brilliant but sad story, as we follow the footsteps of two people who are doomed to fail. However, things are not exactly the way they seem, and as McEwan seems to suggest, even if the whole world comes tumbling down, there's still hope to be found.<br /><br />I believe that anyone out there that likes literary fiction of the highest quality should read this novel, as it has a lot to offer: raw emotions, a great story, a beautiful background, and exquisite writing.who are doomed to fail.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is a very tender story - thought provoking and touching. I loved it and wanted to keep reading - Couldn't get enough.
0345803493|1.0|E.L. James could not write her way out of a paper bag.  Juvenile writing and just a terrible story.  I received this book by mistake (I had ordered the first one).  Traded off with a friend to read the first and then only read this one because I had bought it.  There is something very wrong when a book this terrible can become a hit!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone!  It makes such sense yet we don't think about it this way until reading about the concept and thinking of how to incorporate it into our own relationships.  It's great and should be a pre-requisite for anyone in a relationship!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the best game possible on the face of the earth I would definitely recommend to buy this game!!!!
0345803485|3.0|Book would have read better if the exchanging of email formalities would have left out and just the contents used, kills the mood, like nails on a chalk board. had to keep skimming past them to tolerate the rest.
030758836X|5.0|Twisty, turny fabulousness!  I really liked Gillian Flynn's first 2 books, but this one is by far her best.  I couldn't put it down!!
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|My children have seen these a hundred times now and still love it.  Awesome new show that kids and adults will love.

B009FZFONO|5.0|Great season! Much faster and more excitement and surprises then season 2. Can't wait for season 4 to come on
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I have watch Downton Abbey on TV and had purchased the first 2 episodes and purchased # 3 when it became available -I watch and re watch them once a week -it is by far the best series on TV in some time - FYI -I plan on purchasing more items as needed through Amazon -prices are much better and shipping cost as well and add to that the speed in delivery -really appreciate all above -I am an avid reader so will be scanning for several books I am interested in purchasing
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Very enjoyable movie. Great acting, great script. Artistic in it's gore. So dark, yet so right. Captivating throughout and there is no way to predict what will happen next. Except that the bad guys get what they deserve.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Beautiful images, great story line!, Good move to watch by yourself to get the full experiences. Might need to watch it multiple time to get full grasp of it, but worth it.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I didn't care for the characters or the plot. It was just an ok book. Weak main character and very predictable ending.
6302636779|5.0|I bought this as a VHS then the DVD -I have a combo VHS/DVS player so it is great to have bothe
B00457WZEI|5.0|This has been the best story I have red in my life!!! It was heartwarming and inspiring and if anything war horse is a phenomenal historical fiction that shows a farm boys love to his horse
157421327X|4.0|Zentangle Basics is well written and a booklet that offers basic design ideas that would be great for all ages, though small in the number of pages, it is packed full of design ideas and how to get the basics of this type form of art. The book content states that it would help improve focus and develop dexterity. I believe it would be great for ages 10 through adults. Looks like it would be fun to learn this type of design. It is meant for relaxation and creativity.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|For the first of a series this book captures and holds the reader. The story lines are braided and intertwined together so well.

B005LJKEXS|5.0|I've got my keyboard setup at a different area near my lcd screen (away from the computer) and my mouse is attached to a little belkin usb divider which is of course attached to this bluerigger cord. I did this so i wouldn't need a wireless keyboard. It works like a charm even with multiple devices going through it and its plenty long for my purposes.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|He just gets better and better.  I couldn't wait for this to get to my house, and wasn't disappointed.  He has one of the most beautiful voices in the music industry and this CD didn't disappoint.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|I'm in my late 40s and this movie takes me back to my happy high school days.  The music is awesome - and I loved watching Tom Cruise!  It's a &#34;feel good&#34; movie.  Totally entertaining.
B001FVV2X2|4.0|When it plays without pausing, I enjoy these kooky science adventures.  The characters are interesting and the plots capture my imagination.
B000KN7BIQ|1.0|I had to return this movie to the seller after it would not play in six different DVD and Blue Ray players.  It also took ten days before the movie arrived and that is not acceptable.<br /><br />I wound up purchasing &#34;The Sting&#34; movie from iTunes and downloaded it and played it that same day, with no issues.<br /><br />I am not happy at all with this purchased of the HD DVD movie I purchased from this seller.  The DVD was Damaged or corrupt and would not play.
0823004325|5.0|This is a well written book with lots of information.  The information included in this book will be helpful for sculpture as well as painting and drawing portraits.
B009G7ZYUO|5.0|Got this for my wife for her birthday...nothing says love like RATM!  The DVD is a great bonus - I wasn't expecting so many video clips of their old concerts.  Awesome.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|An entertaining blend of the surreal with the harsh realities of suvival at sea.  How many of the events were real, and how many were delusions brought on by extreme thirst and hunger?
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It kept me on the edge of my seat throughout and I hated having to put it down.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite games. Flo got me started on Time Management games. I love her and all her friends.
B0019NG73G|5.0|For anyone interested in the 1863 Gettysberg battle, this is a first rate movie. Martin Sheen is excellent as Robert E. Lee, while Jeff Daniels' portrayal of Colonel Joshua Chamberlain commander of The 20 Maine in the defence of Little Round Top, with the bugle call and the Union bayonet charge are possibly the highlight of this long movie. Yet set in amongst the story of the battle the relationship of the two Chamberlain brothers is well played. I found, anyone not aware of what happened would wonder at the scene between the characters of Robert E. Lee and J.E.B. Stuart. I think that is confusing and not well explained.
B0063M22QO|1.0|one dimensional with no challenge at all. I love playing mahjong, but this like playing a kids game. I wasted my money and my time
B0074AGVWK|5.0|A wonderful writer , You feel like you know all these folk they become your friends whilst you read Maeve keeps your interest all the way , you miss the people when you finish the book Thanks Maeve
B007ZSBQYE|1.0|Nice idea for a game but the controls are terrible and if you bump into anything it just resets with no explanation very annoying. Deleted.
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|I've been waiting a lot of years for this one, & it doesn't disappoint! Great song selection & package...long may<br />you run, Mr. Stills!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This is a good mouse. I am glad that i made the purchase. When I play games, I like to set my turn sensitivity to the highest setting that they have to allow me to turn around faster...with this mouse can also lower my dpi to a level that I can work with in a second.

B00BU2TEGS|5.0|Fantastic album, it goes from one great song to the next and the beat is fantastic and soothing, Buy it now.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|haven't finished it yet but what I have read it is so good you can't wait to get to the next chapter to see what going to happen with Beth
1601251831|5.0|I picked up the core rules, and needed something for encounters as I got into Pathfinder. This book was exactly what I needed at a reasonable price from a great seller. If you run out of creatures, there are several more volumes.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I didn't think I was going to like this series but once I started reading them, I was hooked.  Loved them all.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I absolutely love Breaking Bad such a well produced show. The CD's were brand new and very very good quality.
B00CBKVMG8|4.0|Good movie lil graphic not for anyone under 15 should watch but for adults it's a real good movie to watch.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I loved season 5. The series gets better than ever! I can't wait to get home to watch it. Exciting!
B00BJDARGO|4.0|The show was great, audio and picture were also good,but you will notice the sound track is dubbed over and it does not always match his live voice.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I absolutely love Breaking Bad such a well produced show. The CD's were brand new and very very good quality.
B00309DC1M|5.0|Movie is awesome, of course. Its so nice on DVD, excellent picture. I don't think blu-ray would make much of an improvement.<br />.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|This movie was great to me because I remember the old video games and the days at the arcades. My boys (7 and under) like it too. They think there are a lot of funny parts.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|get this app!!!!! its super fast and easy to work + IT'S F-R-E-E FREE!!!!!!!!! GET THE APP YOU'LL NEVER GET A BETTER DEAL:D:D:D:D
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book is a far better read than most of the &#34;action novel&#34; type books out there.  The story of how this hero overcame unbelievable obstacles just to get to the Navy (let alone reach the top of his profession) was inspirational.
B00BF11STU|5.0|I really liked this movie. Plot based on fact was good and the acting was right up there with Argo and Lincoln. Jessica Chastaine has you sitting on the edge of your seat with her performance. The subject matter is hard to deal with right now because it does hit so close to home but for me it was eye opening and worth my time.
B009XTF8KQ|3.0|The Possession has many Hollywood contraptions that have been seen before, especially the 'parent missing his kids' activities because he forgot about it' cliche.  Overall though, not a bad flick, especially if you want to see Matisyahu perform an exorcism.<br /><br />An extra on the DVD, \\"The Real History of the Dibbuk Box,\\" is far scarier than the film itself.  Whether the real Dibbuk box actually is cursed or not is a fun discussion, however the coincidental events that transpired over the lifespan of the box definitely provides a haunting, real-world interest for me.  The Possession is worth a rental, especially for this short extra alone.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|This held for me a great suspense which i love in movies...Knowing a few details about the real story sort of helped putting it into prospective...
B001GMQALY|3.0|I had a hard time following the story and had to keep rewinding to figure out what was going on.
B00CDSVZHY|1.0|I get QT, I know his movies are going to be foul and over the top violent but this movie was just silly. Seriously Jamie Foxx was like some super hero cowboy who could shoot a million bad guys while they constantly missed him just like a cartoon. phfft. Everyone used the N word, as  a matter of fact they should have named the move The N Word Unchained... and it got old fast. They should use this movie instead of the water board torture.
B004PGNB1K|5.0|The name of the wind was one of those books you take a chance on while browsing in your local book shop. It was a revelation. I rarely count down to a sequel but I couldn't wait for The wise mans fear. It really stood up. There was so much in it I read both books again about a year later. Now the count down to book 3.
B008602KQI|4.0|Good action.  A valid comment about society and culture.  It is about time there is a believable female action hero for our kids and grandkids.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Probably one of the best recent Bond films. It was very well done and the suspenseful plot keeps you interested through the movie. By far, this is the best one out of Daniel Craig's stint as Bond and I would say better than the Pierce Brosnan films, as well.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Well acted, the plot sticks pretty close to what I could find out in the History books which made it even more interesting to me. Love the show and can't wait until season 2.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was all set to give this book 5 stars. Expertly written, kept you on the edge - and then, the ending. As a writer and author, I know how difficult it is to put a good story to words. Gillian Flynn has done that but the suspense, the intrigue and then a horrible ending. It almost seems the author just ran out of gas towards the end and, well, just ended it. A major disappointment for this reader.
B004OZZ624|4.0|Russell Crow can make just about any movie good.  I liked not knowing for sure until the end about his wife.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is an easy concept (collecting something) and not difficult to play but the presence of the Slender Man adds some fun to it. I downloaded it a couple months ago and often take turns playing it with friends. It is so funny watching people get freaked out about it.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I should have ordered it long ago.  I play it over and over.  I'm sure it will become one of the best CD of all time.  I love Bruno Mars - he is the new Michael Jackson.
0374531269|5.0|Ishmael Beah's book \\"A Long Way Gone\\" is a book that I will never forget.  It is a very dark story that is about his life and journey<br />being a 12 year old child soldier in Africa.  You really feel for the author and can really feel all the emotions of what he felt throughout the book and really want to help these children in Africa that are going through what Ishmael went through.  His writing style is very easy to read which makes it seem very personal.  When you see how he overcame all of the violence and horror that he went through, his story just really makes you more appreciative of how lucky we are to live in America.  It is unbelievable to read what he went through, yet know that he turned his experiences around and is not letting it ruin his life.  It is a fantastic story for everyone to read and will really open everyone's eyes to what is going on in the world.<br /><br />Throughout the book, I couldn't imagine how it felt to go through all of the horror he witnessed and was a part of, especially as a 12 year old boy.  While reading about the rape, violence and the pain he went through and witnessed. I can't even fathom surviving and living to tell the story like Ishmael did.  It truly shows how strong and<br />courageous Ishmael is and it is great to be able to read about his experience and learn about a child soldier's experience and life. Even if you are not a big reader, I highly recommend reading about Ishmael's journey.  I am really glad that I read this story and am even more appreciative of what I have.
B002MFX0RQ|4.0|For some reason, the film Donnie Darko didn't sit right with me.<br /><br />Now I think I know why!<br /><br />If you like the genre, then you might want to re-read Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and assess where her White Rabbit falls on the spectrum . . .
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I couldn't put it down - I didn't expect I would love it let alone like it, but I did.  It was well written and had a lot of examples, scenarios I could really relate to.  not only was it entertaining, but I learned quite a bit.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|This is a decent story, but there are too many grammatical or editing errors.  I find it hard to stay in the story when there are errors that appear as if the author changed the wording of a sentence, but forgot to remove the original wording.
B007SPN5MA|5.0|I like his intellect and his emotion in his singing.  This is a calmer album then some, so, I think I like it better.
B009KEN87O|4.0|A nice old school style space shooter. If you remember space invaders and galaxan then you'll probably dig this game.
B008MEM24S|4.0|Great game for kids & adults... it's challenging & teaches kids science /. physics...  very well designed & fun to play.
B00280LYIM|4.0|just as i hoped, the author is living up to the continued excitement! cant wait to get into the next adventure.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|This is great. I love how u can swipe to erase and that u can see the equation ur doing. its great help for school too. I might be making kind of a big deal about a calculator but this is agreat app.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|In the end we are asked to choose what is the reality? And we learn more about ourselves as we examine our choice. This is an unforgettable and poetic journey
B004GJ1XU2|5.0|This movie is a true classic with an amazing soundtrack, cast & plot - well written & acted...  I highly recommend it.
044024613X|5.0|Really well written. Legal contex accurate. Good courtroom drama. Might not suggest this book for the \\"gentle of heart\\" that have 14 year old kids or grandkids.
B007ZSBQYE|3.0|so I got on played some lvls its rally frustrating when I played and almost impossible but some times fun.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I've always appreciated 'Les Miserable', from book to stage then movie. The actors in my opinion were amazing, they threw themselves into their roles.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game for those who like horses. Good fir kids hand eye coordination! Good to show kids how to take care of animals not just horses. They need to be fed, watered, and you have to nurture them and clean up after them.
B00012QM8G|2.0|Hafe way through the CD...hangs up four times...not happy at all. NOT VEY HAPPY NOT VERY HAPPY NOT VERY HAPPY...OK OK!!!
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|The plot is simple but it's such a well written story that can be read in one sitting. It will make you laugh and definitely make you cry. I am not a YA and it made no difference ... it's a LOVELY book. A must read!
0375851569|5.0|My favorite to read to the kids is One Fish Two Fish. I also like fox in socks, just can't read it fast yet.
B006BGZJJ4|2.0|I purchased 2 of these, as I have had enough of buying Amazon's charger at more than twice the cost - none of the power sources lasts very long and I believe there is a problem with the Fire itself that causes this failure.  The Kindle Fire is completely useless without a power source, so I just have to keep buying them.  However, as I have said before, I will never buy another Kindle - KINDLE IS POOR QUALITY!

B001ANSSDC|5.0|Excellent book can't wait to see the movie.  Although I wish there had been more closure with other family members.
B00BAYLRNO|5.0|This is the most \\"Intense\\" and \\"Heart Wrenching\\" Movies i have ever experienced..! The Vividness of the whole catastrophic scene was hard to watch. The Brutality that these people went through was pure hell. I don't know how the Tsunami scenes were captured but it was just like being there in this unbelievalb Horror they endured..! It was barely impossible not to cry in many scenes that broke my heart.!<br /><br />This is a must have in Blu-Ray and will be glad to add it to my collection..!<br /><br />I give this Movie a \\"10\\" out of \\"10\\"...!!<br /><br />Enjoy,<br /><br />Michael Reynolds
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|It's amazing how much material Jimi had &#34;in the can&#34; when he died. More so that it survived and was preserved. This is a diverse collection of songs in several styles (funk, blues, psych). While there's no &#34;Fire&#34; or &#34;Foxey Lady&#34;, there is plenty to sink your teeth into.
1451626657|3.0|A little more than 200 pages into Catch-22, I was almost ready to throw it out the window and say all kinds of mean things about it here on Amazon. But, having just finished the book, I'm feeling a little kinder towards it.<br /><br />That being said, Catch 22 is a frustrating, tedious slog. It's ridiculously overwritten, about 150 pages too long, and spends fully its first half going around in circles. Reading Catch 22 is like being trapped in an institution for the terminally verbose. It's very, very hard to get into. There's no real plot to speak of, and its annoying, nattering tone will (admittedly, this is probably by design) test the limits of your patience. You need stubborn, bullheaded determination to get through it. And it's really not as funny as some people seem to think it is (I like absurdist humor too - Monty Python and Vonnegut spring to mind - but I found Catch 22's sense of humor more irritating than hilarious). The main reason I finished it is because I didn't want to feel like I'd been beaten by a book.<br /><br />At about the halfway point, the proceedings start getting more interesting and there is a sense of crescendo to all the craziness. It finally, at long last, feels like it's going somewhere. There actually seems to be something at stake, and the larger point materializes more clearly. Certain elements (like Milo's willingness to get in bed with anybody for a profit) are surprisingly prescient and relevant. The last 50 pages or so are tense and satisfying, but they don't entirely redeem the amount of hot air that precedes them. Maybe that's what Joseph Heller was trying to say about war, though: wade through a lot of circuitous BS for a while, after which you can either be complicit or get killed.<br /><br />I'm not sorry I read Catch 22, but I will definitely not be reading it again. I prefer Kurt Vonnegut, who mined a lot of the same territory in a far more mellow and subtle way. Catch 22 is anything but subtle, and it leaves an impression, but it's hard to get a lot out of something so strident.

B0002VFXFE|5.0|I applied this thermal compound paste during a CPU and fan upgrade on my computer. I barely had to use any to get a good coating and my CPU temperatures have been fairly cool.  Now I did install a brand new fan so I'm not sure if its the fan or the compound that made a large difference but the compound certainly can't hurt.  Even though this is a little tube it will last a long time as it only takes a drop or two to coat the chip.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone looking for thermal paste.

B0062KMDZ2|5.0|I had the old movie in three D using the glasses and this is so much better.  I like to sit and just see what I missed the last time I watched it.  For anyone who has a 3D TV this is a must.  Enjoy
0061950726|5.0|Orphan Train by Christina Baker Kline is the type of book that can change how you view a part of history, one that you probably knew very little about, if at all. Based on factual parts of America's history, Kline tells the story of how two orphaned girls from different eras are able to find peace and help each other.<br /><br />Orphan Train is an extremely well written book that captures the reader right away. It is written with alternating chapters that take place in Vivian's past and the current time of 2011. Kline merges the storylines flawlessly in a truly memorable way that will leave you wanting to know more about the actual history of orphan trains and America's not so happy past.<br /><br />If you enjoy reading historical fiction that is based on actual facts, this is a book that I think you will truly enjoy. It is an excellent read that should be shared with others, and I definitely recommend this book for everyone to read.<br /><br />* Thank you to the publisher of Orphan Train, William Morrow, for providing me with a copy of this book for review. All opinions expressed are my own.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I loved this book it's full of adventure and a little bit of violence.<br />Kept me busy in the car and at school.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|It is a treasure I enjoy over and over.  This movie is so beautifully photographed, produced, acted and written.  I consider it to be one of the great achievements in cinematography.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I had the same movie in 3D using the old 3D glasses and this movie is so much better.  I enjoy watching this movie each Christmas Holiday time frame.  My grand chrildren also enjoy this movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't stop reading. I was a little unsure if I would like it, but once I started it was hard to put it down. I hope the rest of the books are as good as this one.
B005DJREJS|5.0|Very good story line and characters.  I'm not much on mtv shows, but this one is very funny and realistic.
B005J3IEZQ|4.0|The best thing about this book is, throughout the creation of this biography, Steve Jobs never intervene in the process, never worried whether this will tarnish his image. A great personality, indeed.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Unable to put down from the first page. The characters are very interesting and how the blend together keeps it interesting.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Family love it. We are vegan family this is a &#34;horror movie&#34;. We are careful about what we eat now.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Another awesome title from Gameloft . No complaints so far. Graphics are console quality on fire hd. Game play is smooth and not too repetitive as some of these kind of games tend to be. I have only played one class so far so I can't comment on them all. Currency seems ok . On a side note please update SIX GUNS . Or even better make a game like dungeon hunter with the free roam capability of six guns.
B007RCJNDE|5.0|Virtually all the threads are neatly tied up though one that I especially liked the Tuon-Matt thread, remained clearly undefined.  If  you like battle scenes this one will quench your thirst!  I wonder if Elaine will allow Two Rivers independence!
B00785P2QC|3.0|A great game. I hate having to constantly log onto Facebook to earn invest points. It really sucks!!. The game itself is good, with that exception.
B005LAIIHG|1.0|My granddaughters raved about this movie and insisted I watch it. They loaned their copy to me, convinced I would buy it after watching it.  No way!  Their uncle and I watched and both thought it was just weird.  A guy who may or may not have survived due to his own ruthlessness, then covered it up with animals he fantasized to replace the real humans in the story he told.  That's all we got from it.
B00B7ERH04|5.0|I love this camera because now I have my granddaughter`s first steps and now it will be easier to share this with the rest of the family. Also I have other wonderful moments caught .<br />Anyone who wants to save those once in a lifetime moments this is the camera for them

B0065GC0BA|4.0|Very satisfying. Liked the ending.  Could see this as a movie. How about Emilia Clarke as Louisa and James McAvoy as Will...
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Kathleen holds your interest with all the people story lines.She tells you how it was in the slavery days. A great book
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a very long time.  The author did a very thorough job of exploring the foster care system from the point of view of a child, single motherhood through an expanse of feelings that I could definitely relate to as well as opening up a language that is seemingly dying.  This book is amazing!
1843104954|5.0|Very informative for parents or people with aspergers. Easy to understand. Would recommend to anyone who wants to understand aspergers. Great book.
0989254607|5.0|The Tegen Cave is an impressive first book by a creative new author.  While I'm not usually one for horrors or fantasy (let alone spiders), Inge-Lise Goss's book definitely appealed to my love of suspense and mystery.  This is a fast-paced read with wholly unpredictable twists and turns, which kept me surprised and engrossed to the end.  I literally could not put it down.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to reading more of the heroics of the Tegen species.
0425252868|5.0|In the late 1930s, rabid philosophies bloomed. Free nations disagreed and called for volunteers. They had been citizens only months before. At some risk, they learned how to fly the most destructive machines ever created. German pilots were fewer, but expected to make fighters a career. Each gave loyalty to their teammates and combat leaders.<br />So, as part of a complex plan, some joined air fleets to hammer Hitler's war machine. Opposing were men of similar age, led by exhausted veterans. Inside aluminum shells, sitting on high-octane gas tanks, with hundreds of ammunition rounds, they met at 180 and 350 MPH.<br />December 20, 1943 (almost 70 years ago), Allied planners sent the fleets to a fighter plant in Bremen. German plotting staffs alerted defense forces. Fighters raced to prep, taxi out, join into formation and position ahead of the '4-Motor Big Autos'. Combat placed hundreds of planes into a parade not much bigger than the city of Chicago. First came angry bursts of Bremen's protective Flak. Then bomber crews saw black-crossed gnats race through pumping slow, but still destructive, explosives. During their firing runs, Germans saw burning chains of 50-caliber bullets. In their freezing cockpits, combatants exhibited extraordinary personal bravery.<br />Within this deadly joust is the story of combat between one USAAF B-17 and GAF Messerschmitt, long declared secret. This book focuses on the next hour of time. It is a tale of unexpected chivalry.<br />Then the book adds to their fantastic story.
B00BEZTMFY|1.0|I could write a very lengthy review about what I believe was wrong with this film.  Instead I think the best word would be plain and simple that it was 'boring'.
B0045LSIRM|4.0|I've come to know Bryan Adams music late in life.  I love the sound of his voice and his music is just plain great to listen to.
B00A89ITZG|5.0|Great, easy to follow book. Brian MacKenzie clearly knows what he is talking about! My only complaint is that the workouts in the back of the book can't be cut and pasted, so it makes it difficult when you don't want to bring your iPad to the gym.<br /><br />I have been doing CrossFit and trying to squeeze in Triathlon training in around it. Not only was I exhausted, but I had other things I needed to be doing with my time (work, family). This book was the answer! It's tough at times to trust in the workouts, but the second time I hit the water. I chugged out 500 meters easily, so it has to be doing something right!
B00340LM8C|5.0|Master director, great actors and wonderful script.  Grab the popcorn, turn down the lights and lose yourself in a movie that has it all.
B008P3SPVU|5.0|Excellent movie - the kind that should give hope and inspiration to everyone!  It's definitely one of my top sports movies.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|Definitely worth the money. For those who are judging, this movie wasn't supposed to be some big romantic hit. Neither were any of the other movies (Dear John, The Notebook, etc...) - although, they did make quite an impact. But the purpose of Nicholas Sparks' books and the movies based on them is truth. Love at it's purest. It's about the story, not \\"Emmy-worthy\\" acting or (like someone pointed out and of which is ridiculous to base a movie on) the scratchiness of one's voice. Julianne Hough plays her character with a great honesty. You may not think it's the best acting compared to other actresses (who have a ton more experience, keep in mind), but she will make you believe her character. And to me, that's all I can ask of an actor/actress - to make me believe their performance. I want to feel that it's real, not that they're just doing a job - which, unfortunately, you can tell in a lot of movies lately. But this movie does just that, I really felt everything in this movie.
B007SGM084|5.0|This is a great read and a great set of books. I would definitely recommend to any woman! Awesome book.
B00BZODDYU|3.0|Mama brings us the tale of two kids lost in the woods who are raised by an unknown entity for five years before being returned to their family, much to the disapproval of the supernatural surrogate mother. The opening act is atmospheric and creepy and doesn't give away too much about what to expect and certainly the little girls are disturbing enough to stay off my Christmas list. There are some of Guillermo Del Toro's trademark fantasy elements and initially at least the camera moves are subtle enough to bring some well-executed scares early on.<br /><br />Plot-wise, it starts to go off the deep end almost immediately the girls are rescued. The psychological evaluation part of the film doesn't really go anywhere and the seemingly obligatory Internet Research Scene was a really lazy way to spoon-feed the audience exposition about what's going on. The new parents, played ably by Jessica Chastain and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, start to act like their common sense glands have been removed and seem to ignore the growing supernatural signs that it's time to get out of the house and head to Disneyland. Even the characterization of the two leads at the beginning of the film is completely forgotten by the midpoint.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as with almost every horror I've seen in the last couple of years, the overuse of CGI kills the scares completely and rehashes so many of the effects from previous films. From the \\"Dark Water\\" rotting wall scene to the fast-moving ramping effect of the monster, we've seen it all before. And it's a shame they painted over Javier Botet's weird, lanky performance as Mama (search for \\"Javier Botet mama movement test\\" on YouTube) - the more we see her as CG, the funnier it gets. The finale is one of the weakest 10 minutes I have seen in a long time and I felt almost embarrassed for the actors trying to get through how bad it was.<br /><br />Mama is like a worse version of The Woman In Black. Though it's more atmospheric and skilled than Sinister, it's a wasted opportunity for what starts as a strong concept and ultimately steps through the motions to reach a conclusion that most of the audience won't care about.it's a wasted opportunity for what starts as a strong concept and ultimately steps through the motions to reach a conclusion that most of the audience won't care about.
B00BAYLQI0|3.0|In the classic film \\"King Kong\\", Fay Wray, the only white woman in a crowd of dark-skinned natives and white treasure-hunters, is singled out by the Witch Doctor, who promptly offers five of his native women in exchange for Fay. No one blinks an eye - even the natives think the life of one white woman is more precious than five of their own people.<br /><br />This thought came to me while I watched \\"The Impossible\\", the true story of a group of tourists who survived the aftermath of the 2004 Thailand tsunami. In real-life, the woman portrayed by Noami Watts was dark-haired and Hispanic, as was her husband. The cynic in me imagines a bunch of Hollywood producers saying, \\"Nobody cares if a bunch of dark-skinned Thais or a Hispanic family suffers in a tsunami - no, make the heroes into white, photogenic Australians and you've got yourself a hit.\\"<br /><br />Now, I'm not saying the suffering of good-looking white Australians isn't important, but \\"the Impossible\\" is so generic, so bland in its storytelling, that I'm forced to notice the predictable casting of the overly familiar faces of Hollywood veterans Watts and McGregor. Their \\"characters\\" are simply that of \\"innocent white tourists on holiday caught in a disaster in a 3rd world country.\\"<br /><br />The film is a thrill ride, nothing more. It holds your attention mainly for the following reasons: it's (a) crafted like a suspense thriller;(b) you want to see the CGI disaster scene (c) the depiction of horrific bodily injuries is gasp-inducing. If you are a med student studying trauma, watch this film by all means!<br /><br />But why focus on this one couple and their family, when there are thousands of similar cases? In a good film, the characters are unique - they grow, change and learn through tragedy. Here, the filmmakers are so lazy they fail to give the events any context. The tragedy is set in Thailand but it could have been any Asian or African country. The characters begin as privileged tourists in a foreign country and depart the same way. Any possible conflict between First World expectations of hospital care and Third World makeshift facilities are avoided. Except for blood and gore, the film has nothing to say.<br /><br />The only lessons seem to be: be very lucky, avoid future Thailand vacations, and be more observant when you're at the beach. By the end of the film, I half-expected to see an ad saying, \\"To donate to the tsunami victim fund, visit [...]\\"country and depart the same way.

B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|All the songs are fantastic!! The changed their sound just a little bit, but i think they have really improved since their last album Set the World on Fire. The story within the album is also great. It is easy to relate to most their songs like always =D
B000683VI4|5.0|This is my favourite movie but i didn't own a copy. I wanted to share it with my boyfriend while he was on vacation because it is such a great love story but I didn't have my copy. I'm just happy to have my own copy and at such an affordable price :-)
B008OOYALE|5.0|My 5 year old and 11 year old daughters love this game...and I'm hooked too. Seems to be a money draw if you let it, though.

B0057F869U|5.0|Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books. Although this version does not include many of the details that make the novel enjoyable to read, no movie has ever done a book perfect justice. That being established, I love the way this movie interprets the heart of Jane Eyre in a format that is captivating and exciting enough for the big screen. Jane's life, though chronological and delightfully detailed in the book, takes an exciting weave through time in the film. It is as if the literature allows you to live life with Jane Eyre while the film lets you travel through her most vivid memories. This creative take on the classic tale is more than adequate in displaying the true nature of her personage (There is no way reveal the minds of the actors. We rely on body language, camera angles and dialogue to display what the character's feelings and intentions are in a movie). The personalities and the emotions portrayed by Mia Wasikowska, Michael Fassbender and Judi Dench are far closer to the imagination of the reader than the other Jane Eyre films before it. It is far more important for me to see the heart of the work lived out rather than witness a few hours of scrutinous detail.  This is why when I feel the itch to watch my cherished Jane on television, I shall choose this version time and time again.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I watched this in 3D on a Panasonic Plasma. Visually stunning, great entertainment.  3D has effects outside the screen but the depth of the ocean scenes are just fantastic.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|To fight for what is important in life. No matter how hard or how long. Hope, there is always hope.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|this games is okay but you lose interest quickly enough.  its even a little frustrating after a few play times.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Many times sequels are hard to follow and less enjoyable than the first in the series. I found Beautiful Darkness to be just the opposite. It delves deeper into the world of Caster even further and keeps you turning pages to see what is going to happen next. Lena and Ethan experience a lot more trials, new discoveries, and more adventure. I recommend this sequel and am looking forward to the next book in the series.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love it. Could sit and play for hours. I like it so much that I have it on my phone and my fire. So I can play anywhere.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I purchased this case at the recommendation of my daughter and I am very satisfied...I am confident that my iphone is secure in this case.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A great sci-fi story of survival in one of the harshest settings that a person could ever find themselves in.  Told in the style of a first person narrative, the author intersperses humor, hope and despair in the travails of the title character.  The story moves along at a comfortable pace and never gets too bogged down in techno-babble which would be easy to do with this type of setting.  A very engaging and enjoyable read which I heartily recommend.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Had seen the reviews on the ABC Book Show before purchasing.  The panel's comments were very positive. so thought I'd buy a copy and I was not disappointed.  A humorous and entertaining read.
B009NPKTN6|3.0|I really liked the music but I thought they could have gotten a better rocker. Tom Cruise just didn't do it for me.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It was a great follow up to the first. My only dislike is having to wait so long for the movie.
030758836X|5.0|This is one heck of a story.  The reader's sympathies constantly switch from one character to the other and then back again.  It held my interest right to the last word.
B0039ZF8D2|4.0|I'm not a fan of rap music, But I like good music, I like this CD ,it is the most truth telling lyrics I have heard in a long time. since I have a Caribbean back ground I enjoy the reggae beats. I rented this CD from the library and enjoyed this ,so I purchased this CD for personal use.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|By the previews I thought this would be more entertaining. I am not familiar with the comic books it was based off of. I didn't really care of this movie but that doesn't mean someone else won't like it.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I really like the game. But what I hate is that you have it for free but then to make the park better I need game dollars which I have to put purchase with real money. It's next to impossible to generate enough game money by leaving up.I'm on level 16 homemade around 50 dollars. I would have paid 50 dollars for this game just to get rid of the money part. The other glitch is that sometimes the game freezes and the time does not move so I don't generate the gold coins or anything that's timed. Over all good game.
B0090X4GLW|4.0|We love the movie, and my daughter really wanted the soundtrack. She really enjoys it. I would rather listen to the songs in the movie, personally.
B008I43DYU|4.0|I really like this app. It helps with all types of equations, since when you flip your device sideways you get all these advanced buttons. I would recommend getting the free version of this calculator app, since there isn't that much of a difference. But I'm a fan of the &quot;pro&quot; version here. The 99 cent version doesn't have ads, and you can choose which skin you calculator has. I &lt;3 the pink one and I like how I don't accidentally click on the ad and it take me to some random website. This app is cool if you're looking for a calculator that expresses you! I hope this helps!<br /><br />  (^-^) Bye!

B008JFUO4U|4.0|We saw 'Oblivion' this weekend in IMAX and it was a visually fantastic and entertaining take on the Sci-Fi movie genre. Enough twists and turns to keep you guessing where the story was going. Left me asking a few questions about some of the inconsistencies (I pay attention to details and how they fit into the story line) but nothing that took away my enjoyment of the film. Definitely came out of it feeling I got a value for my entertainment dollar.

B008N9AAQ4|3.0|Bought this one as a demo for my Blu Ray player, and was not disappointed with that aspect of it.<br />I just wish that Ron Fricke would bring his technical mastery to something that is all beautiful from beginning to end, instead of tainting it with ugly and disturbing scenes.<br />The scenery, temples, traditional dances and the like are all so awe inspiring that it is a real letdown when we have to sit through images of dead babies,crushing poverty and consumer waste.<br />I understand that he has a strong social concience, and I respect that. There are times when an educational approach is called for, however, and other times when one simply wants to be swept away by stunning images.<br />Ron, please make us a film for those times!

0374531269|5.0|Every now and then I come across a good book that I can't set down. This is one of those books \\" A long way gone\\". I had to read it for my English class when I was in high school, and now it is required reading for one of my classes in college. It is a book about an unbelievable journey. It draws you into the story. You want to cry when the author cries, laugh when the author laughs. At the age of 12, no children would ever be able to live in a world where there are only drugs, propaganda, and arms to these boys and turned them loose against each other in a world of constant guerilla warfare and death. However, Ishmael Beah, the author of the book, showed a lot of strength and determination to live by escaping this living hell in Africa with the help of UNICEF at age 15 only to almost be drawn into it again at 17. Instead, he managed to escape to the US where he attended and graduated from Oberlin College.! Now I can see this as required reading in schools. It is not only just a good book, it is important. It shows that if a twelve year old boy can do it then there is no such a word \\"impossible\\". The writing is honest, straight forward, painfully introspective but never self-pitying. Truly an amazing story.
1845767055|5.0|Paul is a fantastic visual story teller. Even if your your interest is not within the Gaming concept world you'll love the use of color and creative character design.
B0095P31L6|1.0|This was one terrible movie.  There really was not anything appealing about this movie.  There was something very off about the look of some of the characters that was just a little too creepy.  Not funny...and it just drug on.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|well worth watching it will keep you glued to the tv all the way through 2 hour plus movie great actor's
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I think it was awesome well written. I would point out parts but I'm not a spoiler. You get sooo sucked in. Can't wait for the next book!
0425263908|5.0|I loved the book and I'm looking forward to the next book I am thinking about going back and reading them again they were so good but I loved fifty of grey
B007IV1E2W|5.0|My daughter and I love watching Doctor Who! It just keeps getting better and better! We look forward the episodes!
0802473156|5.0|Speaks to the heart of what's the matter in marriages. Good for any relationship weather you are in serious trouble or you would like to learn more about how to keep your spouse happy.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|As much as I love the first three, this is the best album so far.  Susan was amazing in the beginning and she is growing in talent and confidence and it shows in the work. If you like Susan, you'll love this collection.
B0074VA2T2|2.0|My 3 and 4 year olds were bored with this quickly, I was bored watching them. There's no sense of accomplishment for the kids and trying the few different(?) activities available requires an unintuitive navigation back to the main menu first.<br /><br />I feel an enthusiastic read through of the book with my kids a lot more rewarding.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|First half of book was interesting, but then reality went out the window and it got more and more implausable. The ending was rather stupid. I've read all the books, most of which I've enjoyed, but would not reccomend this one. If this vien of implausable plots continue, will drop from my &#34;must read&#34; list and stick with John Stanford, who never lets me down
1607066017|5.0|I really like this series so far.  I have read Y The Last Man by the same author and this one is as good.  I wasn't sure at first but I really like it.  Hopefully it continues to be just as good.
B0098460O4|5.0|They are singing together better than ever.  An absolute joy. I eagerly await their next album.  Simon made an excellent investment as usual.  Stars on the rise.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I really love the show. It has a great plot and keeps me going for more episodes to watch. Its worth the price
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game! Love the change from the first game with the ropes and caves! Fun for everyone and great time killer!
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|The performances of every actor were outstanding. The story line was the best, and the supporting cast brought the movie to life. I would highly reccomend this movie.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|This movie really had a couple of funny scenes that were scattered through a poorly written plot with no real goal. Some scenes are comical however most result in one or both parties involved being shot down and leaving a scene beat down. I am also currently watching Lost and the lazy writers felt the need to make reveals on great show in their movie. The reveals had no comical or breakthrough to the characters in the movie what so ever. Thanks for ruining that for me. The movie had a couple scenes with such poor acting I thought it was from the blooper reel or deleted scenes. Anyway the biggest waste is watching Paul Rudds character dig himself deeper holes while pissing off his wife and lining his mooching fathers pockets. This film was like one of the bad episodes of Everybody Loves Raymond that lasted an hour and a half longer than it should have. The movie in the end wraps up with everything being great like they never had marital problems in the first place. This one is a definate pass not just for the spoilers to an unrelated show. This is pass because it felt less like a comedy they portrayed it to be and more like a social commentary on being sad 40 and clawing at straws with every stereotype possible. From women lying about age to parents overreacting to social media and even new age medicine. I enjoyed Knocked Up.
B000001EHS|5.0|Great music, great band, great memories, I recommend it. The CD was delivered with a damaged case though, but the CD wasn't damaged.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My son got me to watch this series with him. It keeps you hanging on week to week. I cant wait for the next season to start. I would not allow small children to watch this program. A++
B00BOX0K0M|1.0|First one was scratched. Replacement was scratched worse. Very little protection over the filter material...plastic on plastic.. Not sure if that was cause, but they were both scratched...returning them..I'm done with this brand....
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Complete and thorough examination of the events leading up to Lincoln's election: the character and greatness of the man, himself, his &#34;team,&#34; and the enormous difficulties experienced, beginning even weeks before his inauguration. Goodwin captures the era beautifully and points out the similarities to modern presidential elections and terms of service. She also covers the extreme attitudes regarding slavery - north and south - which  could have broken this union completely, had it not been for the courage and &#34;smarts&#34;  of Abraham Lincoln. Though long, the book can be read leisurely, put down and picked up at will. It  provides powerful insights into the Lincoln presidency which, somehow, never made it into our history classes.<br /><br />JudyL.
B0041CGP02|5.0|Brings back great memories. Great music, but received the CD with a damaged case. The CD is fine.<br />I recommend it.
B00C32R64G|4.0|This album is definitely different but its a good album. Cant wait to see them at Rock on the Range in Columbus.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|love this movie love great cast love matthew and ryan also marisa show how we all need help how far will you go for your love ones when he first start out love money more than anything till it comes to his family .
0385344228|5.0|It was hard to put the book down ... and I was pleased my husband was gone for the weekend, so that I could devour the book without distractions.  I think anyone who's a parent and survived having a moody teenager can relate to the parents in the story.  The dynamics between the parents -- their self-doubt, their misgivings about their son, and their conflict heightened the suspense of the story.  It was like watching a marriage disintegrate before your very eyes.  This is one of those books that you'll want all your friends to read and will haunt you for days after finishing it.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the writing technique of mixing the first-person narrative (from Andy, the father) with the transcript of the grand jury investigation (and the conflict between Andy and his nemesis, Neal).
B00881PTRC|3.0|do to your trying to make an HD game more inhanced your different colors & fonts make it very hard to read thus making it not very pleasant to play!
B009WO7NQO|1.0|This is ridiculous!! After paying for this game we can only--literally--play ONE level, because you HAVE to clear each level with three stars, and even after THAT, we still weren't allowed to move on to the next level without paying--which I refuse to do!! My son, who is four, can't clear the level with only one bird...it took me 20 minutes to do it for him so he could keep playing, and then we were still stuck on the same level. This is a scam and a joke...so not waste your time and money!!
0062059963|3.0|I am such a fan of The Selection. It left on a real cliff hanger. I've been looking forward to The Elite for a year now. What happened is my question? The cheesy bachelor type show formula pretty much disappeared and I missed the antics. Everything was solved with too much ease. Kiera STILL didn't explain the world she's building. I can't imagine anyone reading someone's diary that re-writes all the history you've ever known, and just put it down because they're tired....WHAT!? So lame. I kept hoping the Rebels would kidnapped America/Maxon. Or that we'd all find out Aspen was working for the Rebels and get the other perspective. Instead it was just a teen angst filled 350 pages of love triangle indecision. Im so disappointed. I don't have the heart to give it anything below 3 stars since, I love The Selection so much. This really fell short though.
B00AEBBA36|5.0|Great movie that really picks up the intensity of the war and the personal lives it affected. Mel Gibson did a great job.
B00BESKTMG|1.0|I really applaud this effort, but the best things about this film were the performances by Crowe and Mann...and the closing credits. If RZA really wanted to do the genre justice while paying homage to the Kung Fu films of the 70s, he should have asked for some help. This film had so much potential and such a body of impressive talent, both in terms of acting skills and martial arts performance, it's really a shame it was so painful for me to even finish in one sitting. I suppose the only reason I did was because I didn't want to come back to it. This wasn't just bad...it was shockingly bad. As in awful. Truly awful. And I really like the vision and the goal and RZA! I liked the cast. I liked the music. But, even with all those likes in mind......yeah......it was just mind-numbingly awful. I think I may have a migraine from watching this.
B00008973A|5.0|Was so glad to find this DVD have been looking in bargin bins @ stores with no luck! We use to watch this on VHS when she was younger. We'll watch it together I'm sure!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|If you ever wanted to learn about zoos, the behavior of animals, and how people handle traumatic situations, this is a good read for you.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Great idea to join the blu ray And the DVD in just one single box. The bluRay is very complete about the extras.
B005HEPS6A|5.0|Arguably the best season of the whole series. The Best of Both Worlds is rated among the top cliffhanger episodes on tv of all time.
B0013N3DSE|5.0|This is my favorite Errol Flynn & Olivia de Havilland movie. They just look & work so well together. This was filmed in Technicolor, which makes the colors really pop out. Absolutely Gorgeous. The Aspect ratio is 1:33:1 which is not my favorite, but it was before wide screen was available. This is just a really good movie to watch over & over. It has a really great cast too. The Blu-Ray is pretty nice also. I have this in Dvd & have not watched that version since I got the Blu-Ray. That should tell you something. The Audio seemed fine to me, although I listen with external speakers hooked up to an older stereo. No Digital sound here. There are also a good amount of special features on the making of the film & various other things. More than I thought they would have. I am really glad I got this on Blu-Ray. The best way to watch the film I think. If you like Olivia & or Errol you got to have this in your collection. But you already know that if you like them, right.
1439196834|5.0|The book looks awesome and I already laughed at the first play in the playbook. I'm willing to tryout one of these plays one day, one day. It's great to read and great to get a good laugh out of it as well. Thanks for the book, really love it.
B005HSL626|5.0|Great game, everyone loves it, downloaded it for my kindle fire, Great Great thing! nice little app to spend spare time!

1452110581|5.0|Its hard to find an enjoyable book for pre teens but I've bought this for 2 of them and they love it.  It's so funny and I love that it is poetic.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|Well after 144 reviews before mine what is there left to say ? Back in 60's England I used to watch a TV show where comedy script writers were asked to comment on various issues regarding writing.  It was suggested to one of the panel that a good period novel required four essential ingredients...religion, high society, sex and mystery. To this end  the panelist was to describe in twenty five words or less a story he might write with these essentials. His answer..\\"Oh my God said the duchess, I'm pregnant, who done it ?\\" Twenty five words cannot possibly describe \\"The Duchess War\\". This is a wonderful story. If you are a fan of Bronte and Flaubert this book is tailor made for you. The plot is well constructed and the characters fit like a glove. For me there is nothing quite like the satisfaction felt when a book totally insulates the reader and takes one out of the chair transported to another world entirely. The icing for me is a story that ends well and satisfies completely and does not let the reader down in its ending as so often happens in today's frenetic world of publishing. If you are a fan of the historical mystery fiction/romance genre then you won't be disappointed. But let me go further. If you enjoy historical mystery fiction without romance thrown in, which I prefer, please give this story a try. I was hesitant but that went out the window very quickly. I became utterly engrossed and pulled an all nighter with \\"The Duchess War\\". I have been very lucky of late with my Kindle purchases having now been introduced to two very talented up and coming writers of fiction within the last few months. Both Courtney Milan and Martin Crosbie have what I described in my review of Mr.Crosbie's \\"A Temporary Life\\" an innate sense of the human condition. I read Ms.Milan's prequel novella \\"The Governess Affair\\" which spurred me on to the next in the series. The book can stand alone but I am glad I read them in sequence as the prequel made the whole experience that much more informed and satisfying for me .  So now, with tingles  of expectation, I am about to settle down to the third in this series \\"\\"Kiss For Midwinter.\\" I could go on and on waxing poetic about Courtney Milan but that will take up your precious reading time, which  I humbly suggest,  would be far better spent reading her book.  She's very very good at what she does, and what she does is write a damn good story !
B00ATPVA78|5.0|This was a good game in that it gave you plenty to do,and had a good story.It's really better than just an h/o game in that there were more interesting ways to find things and get clues than just the ordinary throw it all together in a jumble.It also has a wide variety of mini-ames in it.All around a very good and fun game well worth the money.
B00BD2DRHW|2.0|I don't like this one.  Maybe because I haven't figured out how to play it correctly,  I will keep trying
B0053YGYO4|1.0|I enjoyed some albums of Coldplay in the past. They are not a great band but they make some enjoyable songs. They are, however, one of the chief guilty parties in \\"The Loudness Wars\\". Their albums became less and less listenable with every new release. The mastering is horrible. It's very loud and very compressed. You may not realize this whilst listening from iPhone earbuds or car stereo, but listen to it on quality headphones (I tried Sennheiser Momentum and AKG Q 701) or a good hi-fi system and you will hear that it just sounds awful. I do not know if the band wants it that way or the record company takes that decision, but the result is a poor sounding album made for listening from a smartphone with rather low quality headphones such as Beats.<br /><br />Oh, I must also say, this album is their worst. It's meant for teenagers and children, I think which is understandable since they are the major market of iPhone type of music. Someone who enjoys quality music listened through quality equipment would most likely return this album as soon as possible.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|I first read this as a young teen and always remembered it. It was wonderful to re-read as an adult and gain a different perspective this time.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Certainly a great movie and a lot of fun watching it, but also very good quality Blu Ray.  Also very interesting special features and extras.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is one of my favorite games. I keep trying to beat my best time and that's what make it so challenging.
0152023984|5.0|The book arrived as promised and the condition expected.  It is a great value for a hard covered book.  Will enjoy reading it.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|It was so good! I like Ky and Xander! It's so hard! I love this book and how the next one is good too!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Viewing this on a Vizio passive 3D TV with a Sony 3D Blu Ray produced really nice effects and a viewing experience.  Excellent blu ray quality and good set of special features.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|It's a good thing that this app was free because I had zero guilt in removing it from my Kindle Fire HD. It froze and force closed from the get go and the voice creeped out my little girl ( and me too, for that matter). Just weird and non-functional and unneccessary.
B006FO3ERQ|1.0|This was by far one of the worst books I have read.  I continued to plug along thinking for sure it was going to progress and have an interesting plot... it did not.
B004ZGI2KK|3.0|There was nothing horrible about this movie but nothing great either. It was mildly entertaining, but was not overly compelling.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I LOVE this little British band.  I recently came across them and can't stop listening to them.  They have real, true talent that is very hard to find these days.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I really like Angry Birds the game. But I could not stand the suggestive and violent ads that kept popping up on this free version of the game. I had to delete it for that reason and until I can find a free version without vulger popups, I'll just play the many Free versions on my computer.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|i really enjoyed this story told from a dog's insightful perspective.  I laughed and I cried throughout this well written book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Keeps you in your toes for most of the book! I can't wait to read the third! I hope it reveals more!
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I'm addicted to this band.  I can't stop listening to them and they are truly talented.  It's very different from the manufactured bands that need a computer to help them sound better.  Mumford & Sons has all the raw talent true musicians should posses.  It's a MUST buy!!
B005HSL626|5.0|I got addicted to Fruit Ninja on my son's Google and was really excited that it was offered for my Kindle Fire HD. Who would have thought slicing through virtual fruit with your fingers could be so exciting. We really are a simple minded bunch :D
B003HARV3Y|5.0|I really enjoy the Percy Jackson movies especially this one. A great cast and the visual effects are great too! Has a great story line if like mythology and since I do it works for me and my son. Product is as described and was on time. I would purchase from this seller again. Thanks again
B0084AZXKK|4.0|This is a great classic that is entertaining and thrilling. . It is worth reading no matter what age.  Take your time and get lost in the story.
B003O85W44|5.0|If you loved this CD like it deserves, you'll love it even more on vinyl.  There is one song on the entire compilation that is bad (Month of May), and most Arcade Fire fans disagree with me about that anyway.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|When you pay as much as you do for these tablets, you'd think an alarm clock feature would come standard. So I was happy to see that this was offered for Free. There are a ton of different sounds you can choose to wake up to and it's easy enough to use. I also like the choice of how to access the snooze feature.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Hard to get into after the second one, but it was a great book. I really loved all the books!
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Great followup to Doowops & Hooligans - enjoying every song on this new CD!  This is a must have on my iPod!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have never read a trilogy that held my interest from book to book. I almost wish there was a fourth book to follow.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|I hesitate to actually purchase apps for my preschooler not knowing how she will react to them. But this one is worth the money, for sure! You get to do several different activities with each letter and it's easy enough for a 3yr old to navigate through. I really like it when she repeats the narration and can tell me A is for Alligator!
B00AIBZJLG|4.0|Shows acts by the cast of Cirque from a variety of their standing shows. Very well presented, my only issue is that the camera angles switch very rapidly. They always show a very good view of the act but if you are not used to it the rapid angle changing of the camera can be confusing.
B003JH8LPW|1.0|I was deeply disappointed in this book.  I found the dialogue to be juvenile, without merit, even insultingly inept.  I struggled to keep reading this trash.  'Had to force myself to finish the book.  Why Dan Brown ruined a brilliant concept is beyond my comprehension.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was a perfect continuation from Book 1. It answered questions that the reader might have had in the first book. The level of excitement remained the same as in the first book.
B00881PTRC|4.0|I think that this app was very well thought out as it includes clues from quite a few languages. You are also able to choose different themes so you're not always trying to save the guy from the noose. I also like that you can play 1 or 2 players with this version. The one thing that would give it 5 stars is if you could guess or play more than one word phrases.
0062238868|5.0|The takedown of Osama bin Laden at his refuge in Pakistan thrust the institutionally secretive SEALs into the modern-media spotlight. Soon the SEALs seemed to become America's favorite warriors: silent, deadly, and mysterious. American Sniper is written by Chris Kyle, an active duty Navy Seal. Kyle was called to action after September 11th. His evolution from restless civilian to dedicated killer shows the amount of commitment he had to defend the beliefs of God and country, accepting the fact he may lose his life fighting for them. Kyle's life lessons and enthralling stories of time spent around the world have the reader clenched to the book for hours. The story of strife between husband and wife is what gives American Sniper much of its significance: the truism that even when the shooting stops, the impact of the war on those who fought it, and those who love them, has only begun. In an exceptionally well written memoir, Chris Kyle conveys humorous and inspirational stories from before, during, and after his deployments to the Middle East. American Sniper is an unforgettable and masterful account of his astonishing experiences in the theater of war. This memoir can easily strive to be one of the great war memoirs of all time.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Having read the book was afraid I would be disappointed. Jennifer Lawrence portrayed Catniss spectacularly. Her facial expressions and actions did the book justice.
1449433251|5.0|It has every thing. Plus, it has EVERYTHING!!!<br /><br />I love it, Calvin and Hobbes at its best.<br /><br />Ps.: Sorry for my bad english
0470901071|5.0|I have recently decided to start studying for my CCNA, CCNP and CSSIP. After reading several reviews of different books, I decided to get a copy of this book for my CCNA. I have never seen a book with so much detail information and concise explanation of networking. Although I have done several networking course in colleges, the regular college text book usually presents a survey of topics. However, this book goes into the nuts and bolts of those topics the are glossed over in the usual college textbooks. I will highly recommend this book to anyone wishing to further their understanding of networks fundamental. I will also recommend that any college student taking a networking course should have this book a supplementary text.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This is my first Gaming mouse. I was willing to pay more, but i found that this mouse had some nice features with good reviews. I'm happy with the product, i like that the default color matches my Razor Nostromo Gamepad, which you can also buy on amazon. I find that four weight cylinders is a ideal weight for me, since i'm use to a wireless mouse with a battery in it. The buttons are all well placed, the texture of the mouse is soft, with rubber on the side where you rest your thumb.<br /><br />It has 2 profiles for different games in the software, and many adjustments that can be made. I'm not very knowledgeable about gaming equipment and I have nothing to compare this mouse to, but I think it's great. So, if you're looking for your first gaming mouse, this would be a good choice in my opinion. The most interesting feature is the braided cord to me, I've only seen it on my Gamepad and that was over $70, so to me this mouse is under priced for the quality, and I'm glad to have bought it. :)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am hooked!  Loved it!  Wish the season was longer, though.  I love Maggie Smith.  She has some great comments!
B006NFKUF6|3.0|Very cool,nice graphics,and good plot.the ninja hero's name is weird, it's only hoodie,and it has a cool comic with it
1595826971|5.0|If you liked the Alice series, this book is amazing. The book's build quality is excellent. The art adds another dimension to the series.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|I like stories that have a mystery to try to figure out.  Also like the tv show Bones so felt familiar with the heroine..
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game was mad I couldn't get it on my phone so I  bought a kindle so I could play...thanks for making this game
B001684L0A|5.0|Love it ...Love it. The acting is superb but it differs from the book somewhat.  Not a bad thing but the book paints John Adams as much less melancholy. This is a film that should be watched by all Americans. It was with great sacrifice and perseverance that John Adams and the other founding fathers made the United States of American what it is today. I see now what others have said that he is the most underrated leader in our history.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|When I'm caught somewhere and don't have the Kindle this works great.  I have the Galaxy S3 so the screen is almost as big as my original Kindle anyway!
B001AUEMFS|5.0|I purchased this song few days ago and I listen to it everyday while I drive to work.  It is just nice to hear this music on the road to work.  I recommend it.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I just downloaded this game and I can't stop playing it. It's very addicting. I really does pass the time away.
0307477479|5.0|Fantastic read!  I'm not a fan of super modern/contemporary literature and hardly ready any, but this book is absolutely spectacular.  The stories are beautifully intertwined, the writing is superb, and the characters stay with you long after you've finished reading.  Highly recommend.
0385349947|4.0|Okay, so Ms. Sandberg, Facebook's COO, started off on the wrong foot with me with her insistence that Lean In is not a self-help book. I say it is, but she calls it, (p 9) \\"sort of a feminist manifesto.\\"  Then there's her sky high socioeconomic status, which she smartly defends at about the point most of us start to think it, (p 11) \\"Some critics will also point out that it is much easier for me to lean in, since my resources allow me to afford any help I need.\\" Fortunately, those willing to give her a chance, will likely feel satisfied that much of the information she provides, which includes research data; (p 102) \\"Only 74 percent of professional women will rejoin the workforce in any capacity, and only 40 percent will return to full-time jobs;\\" anecdotes about her experiences (after racing to a meeting at Google with morning sickness, she successfully lobbies for expectant mother parking); things she's learned from other business leaders; and statements of opinion, like (p 30) \\"The internalization of failure and the insecurity it breeds hurt future performance, so this pattern has serious long-term consequences;\\" (p 35) \\"The ability to learn is the most important quality a leader can have;\\" (p 79) \\"Statements of opinion are always more constructive in the first person \\"I\\" form;\\" and (p 80) \\"The ability to listen is as important as the ability to speak\\" is useful.<br /><br />Even as someone who chose to stop leaning in (or even working) once I had children, based on the pattern I've seen with my friends who stopped working and those who continued to work after having children, I can't argue with the evidence she provides that support her contention that women's choices often make them their own worst career-forwarding enemies, (p 8) \\"...tearing down these internal barriers is critical to gaining power.\\" I like that she gives credit where credit is due to not only herself (for her hard work) but also to other factors and persons who've helped her, (p 38) \\"I know that my success comes from hard work, help from others, and being at the right place at the right time\\" but that she is willing to admits her vulnerability in sharing, among other things, the fact that she has, on occasion, cried at the office. Additionally, that she said at least one nice thing about full-time stay-at-home moms endeared her to me, (p 167) \\"Full-time parents--mostly mothers-constitute a large amount of the talent that helps sustain our schools, nonprofits, and communities.\\" I'd consider myself part of that group.

B005LAIHSG|1.0|such a waste of a beautiful movie. Couldnt find a more wooden actress to play Snow if they tried. She was ok in the Twilite stuff but this was out of her league entirely. I forgot I had even watched this movie until I saw this DVD pic on amazon. Visually stunning and all the other acting is impeccable. Possibly a good purchse because you will need to watch again and again to remember this forgettable heroine.
B0006J28MI|4.0|i haven't watched this show in a long time so it was great. My kids really enjoyed it very much.
B002D0L0R2|5.0|The music is catchy, the actors are on top of their game and the whole comes together wonderfully. Love it.
B008QE9XD2|2.0|I love anything Tim Burton does and I love both vampire movies and am a Dark Shadows fan. But I own this movie and actually forgot I had it. Quite campy for him. Entertaining for the eyes but not sure if it was the dialogue or what but it was not a stand out. I found Sweeney Todd much more engrossing and that was a musical! This one I would rent not buy if I had to do it again.
B0055SWM08|5.0|peaceful at the same time very challenging  Love it  very addicting  its an excellent game to unwi d n relax before going to sleep  i highly recommended
0385347774|5.0|Could not put down this guilty pleasure! Lost much needed sleep due to same, and now it is my daughter's turn.  The plot is carefully crafted, and I appreciated the author's sly commentary on the ways men and women try to appear to each other in the initial stages of courtship and how they later attempt to reconcile those images with the stark reality of intimacy.
6304696515|5.0|The acting was tight, the settings stunning. The story was awful, but the characters were brought to life so beautifully, you forget how awful the story is. Definitely a must-have.
B000RH0C8G|2.0|I read two earlier books of Michael Lewis, but this one I found totally boring.  I could not get into it, especially after his other books focused on the world of corporate finance.  I gave up reading it to the end.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|It tends to look like a show from the 80s and might look and sound boring and stupid, but it would have to be one of my favorite shows they still make them and ask almost anyone 13 through 16 and i know that they heard of this funny, dramatic, and lots of action of a show
1416583432|3.0|I grabbed this book as soon as I became a dog owner, hoping to uncover some of the mysteries of my new four legged friend. Ms. Horowitz uses some great examples from her relationship with her own dog to flesh out her theories. This makes for some very entertaining storytelling. The greatest takeaway from this book for me as a dog owner is the reminder of how invaluable patience and consideration is. My four-legged new best friend has an entirely different POV on our shared world, due to his incredible senses.  Thanks to this book, which is far from perfect (perhaps a better editor would have helped some of the contradictory observations,) I have a whole different type of relationship with my dog than the one I had with another dog years ago.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the type of show where you can't just watch one episode at once. You just keep buying one after the other. Each episode is a cliff hanger. Great cast, great actors. Just an overall great show.
B003Y5H5HO|2.0|When I received this DVD, it came in a padded envelope.  There was no normal box containing the DVD, it was wrapped in a poster, and the disc was in an envelope.  The DVD disc was a plain CD, with the name of the movie handwritten in black marker.  The movie actually did play, but this was not what I expected to order.
B000002LR6|5.0|Ministry is one hell of a band with a lot of very good music, and this is the best CD they ever put out, so yeah...BUY IT.
B003V4ASV8|5.0|Having studied taekwondo - a Korean martial art - for several years it has been with great interest that I've been following the current events that are happening in North Korea in the news.  I wanted to know more about this mysterious country and so I found this book and boy am I glad that I did.<br /><br />We are told the stories of several people who managed to defect from this country.  We learn about the country's regime and how they were brainwashed into thinking that they were living the best lives they could, which was a complete lie that was spun to them, and of course, the dictator worshipped as a god.  We learn of the country's cruelties and the devastating famine and how these people wake up to the fact that they have had the wool pulled over their eyes and they manage to wake up to this.  This country appears to be like a living version of George Orwell's 1984 and it's going on right now.<br /><br />The stories of each individual was absolutely gripping and was a real page-turner.  How they managed to survive the famine was shocking and enduring and their individual escapes thrilling and a massive relief.  What was also fascinating was how they adapted to life when they finally managed to reach South Korea, imagine seeing that for the first time after living in poverty for so long and not knowing any better?  This book is essential reading for anyone interested in this country and one of the most riveting I've read for a while.

B005OJTVMK|4.0|The color is exactly what is shown, I've heard the purple is deeper than the picture shows. I like this case, however the rounded corners provide little protection to certain parts of my Kindle Paperwhite.

B005S9EKCW|5.0|I loved the movie (would've been better if someone else played Javert . . .), but that's evident in other people's reviews.  So I'm going to keep my comment short.  What I liked about buying this one is that it came with two discs (a regular DVD & blue-ray DVD) and several digital copies.  Now it's on my computer and iTunes so I can watch it anywhere if I want to!  I can also download it to other devices if I want to.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|I am still in awe of the twist in this movie. This is a must watch for Bond fans and I was not disappointed.
B00BHBBSZ2|5.0|I really love this app.  Not only can you write your notes instead of typing them, but you can email them. I use this for to-do lists, grocery list, important phone number, etc. The possibilities are endless.  Now the I have found this app, I don't think I could live without it.

B0067TQQI8|5.0|This is an impressive little device.  It charges faster and lasts longer than I'd expected.  If you've played Ingress, you know how brutal it is on the battery - it can fully drain my phone in around an hour, and usually drains even while charging.  I played for over 3 hours with my new Anker and still had 100% charge on my phone.  The Anker still showed 3/4 charge too.  I probably could've gotten away with the lighter 5600 mAh, but I have a feeling I will appreciate the extra capacity when we travel or when the next storm knocks out power.<br /><br />I've used spare batteries in the past, but having to shut down the phone, swap, and then wait to reboot was a hassle. It's nice to be able to plug in your device whereever you are (on the road; on the couch) and without interruption.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Classic Harry Bosch.  Could not put it down. Can't wait to pick up the next one. Connelly really makes his characters come alive. Tense, compelling reading.

B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Though a big Austen fan, I put this one off for the longest. I do not wish to spoil it in the least by giving a detailed account of the story. I can only say that I devoured this book, and it consumed my thoughts every moment that I could not be reading it. Best. Jane Austen. Ever.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse is a fun game for kids and is free so it's cheap, too. But very fun because it has all these different types of horses like a zebra and a white quarter horse. So, I think if you like horse to get this game.

B004GJDQT8|1.0|I use a generic tablet that is not Google Store Certified and someone suggested this app as an app source. Once installed, the program would rarely load. I would have to uninstall and reinstall to get it to work and it would work only after the reinstall before it would stop again. I contacted Amazon and requested the older version (not available through Amazon's website). They sent it, I installed it, and it works great. I can download apps, it sees and prompts me to update current apps, and there is no longer any startup issues. The new version may work with some tablets, but if you search the internet on this new version, these are not uncommon problems. If you need to get apps and you can't use Google's appstore, and this new version doesn't work for you, contact Amazon and request the old version.
B002ITWSUQ|5.0|I love this movie!  I never heard of the story of penelope and was completely surprised by the ending! So cute!
0307959856|4.0|This is not a 'heavy' novel.......but, one to simply sit back and enjoy when you are in a Jane Austen mood.  The setting and theme is fun and well done.  I very much enjoyed reading this.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I started reading this book and I thought I had it figured out. But then with every chapter something new got added into the story and I'd have to change my theory. I loved how this book was written in the first person, whether it was Nick or Amy's perspective. I won't give away what happens--but this is a great read and will keep you on your toes!

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This one really tugged at my heart.  The depiction of a man's personal struggles, almost to the death, and the description of life in rural Ireland were well done.
0316223239|5.0|I don't even know what to say: be prepared to cry, sigh, try to understand, have such feelings, and then just wonder what will ever happen in the future.  This story is written in the voice and mind of a 5 year old boy. - a very interesting concept and way to present a novel.  My recommendation is to read this, and &#34;The Language of Flowers&#34;
B0020M99LC|5.0|OMG. I loved this one . He gives bond a new dimension and depth . I loved this one and the ones after.

B006MW3UZW|4.0|It good story all the way through, never regret watching an episode.  Only watch if you like British television though.
B00AE2J5HI|2.0|Wanted this movie to be better than it was.  Relies on violence to make it compelling.  Fails.  Could have been a good one, just missed the boat.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I really enjoy this game. My only complaint is that it should be easier to complete collections. Daily tournament is nice.

B005DJRIXU|1.0|This isn't Awkward, it's crass.  I suppose people watch this kind of thing for entertainment but it is pretty disturbing any got past the first scene.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I will not reveal much about the storyline, as I think it is more valuable to the reading experience if you know as little as possible. This is a lovely story about friendship, love, selfishness and unselfishness, coming to terms with life and having the right to choose what you want out of life and the courage to act upon it. It is a beautiful story and it touched me deeply, which was very unexpected as I wasn't exactly hooked right from the beginning. However the characters slowly but steadily started to grow on me when the story unfolded itself and arriving to the end of the book I read fours hours straight, the last hour with a box of kleenex by my side. Now....go buy this book!
B004GXKBFQ|5.0|This was so fast and easy to work with. I really enjoyed the ease when shopping here. I would def recommend to anyone!

B00AQ71FLK|5.0|:-) Love it couldn't as for a better online game for my kindle even my sister loves this game, can't stop playing.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Watched Django it gave a more gritty realistic view of slavery which was way overdue and appreciated.  For my taste it was a bit too bloody and the blood wasn't the coreect color.  When a few \\"hits\\" ocurred you could almost hear the sound of a balloon filled with fake blood popping.  All in all a great movie but keep the kids out!
B00AQM8H9I|3.0|Not sure I've got the hang of it yet.  Have only played a few times.  It's a cute kid's game.
B00006J9OV|4.0|At present, there are three versions of Parsifal on DVD worthy of consideration: this one, the 1981 Bayreuth version conducted by Horst Stein (see the previous review here by Bob Epstein), and the recently released 1998 Bayreuth performance conducted by Giuseppe Sinopoli that I have reviewed elsewhere. Each has its pros and cons, which I will briefly summarize as follows.<br /><br />The Met production easily has the most beautiful staging, designed by Otto Schenck, who also produced the fabulous set for the Met's previous Ring cycle.  The characters' costumes are likewise the most naturalistic and attractive. Kurt Moll is a wonderful Gurnemanz, but compared to his studio recording under Karajan a decade earlier it has lost some of its original velvety body and luster.  As Parsifal, Jerusalem is starting to show some wear and tear on his voice at the Met in 1992 as opposed to his prime form at Bayreuth in 1981, but is still quite good; only Placido Domingo could compete with him in the role at that time.  Much the same can be said for Bernd Weikl as Amfortas: he is preferable at Bayreuth in 1981 to the Met in 1992, as there is some audible wear and tear on the voice with age, though again he is still decent overall.  Unfortunately, Franz Mazura (an actor who took up a few opera roles) is simply awful as Klingsor; he rasps and snarls with his wobbly, dessicated voice, but hardly sings a single note.  However, Waltraud Meier is arguably the best Kundry on DVD, and one of the best in any medium, a truly great artist who has the full measure of this tortuous role.  Somewhat oddly, though, she and Jerusalem do not strike the sparks off one another in Act II that one would expect, seeming slightly distant instead.  The chorus and orchestra are top-notch.  Levine's conducting is famously slow, but he only really gets bogged down at a couple of points; otherwise the score bears his approach well.<br /><br />As for the competition -- the 1981 Bayreuth production under Horst Stein has the best singing but the least desirable staging.  As already mentioned, Jerusalem and Weikl are in prime form there, with Hans Sotin providing a beautifully sung Gurnemanz with a lighter voice a shade less refulgent than that of Moll, and Leif Roar as a first-class Klingsor who conveys all the menace of his part while singing (rather than barking) every note.  Eva Randova is also a fine Kundry; contrary to the claims of some critics she does not have a wobble in her voice, though sometimes it is hard-pressed and one can hear the stress -- but then, that also fits the part well.  Stein provides a brisk account of the score (only 240 minutes!), the antipode of Levine (a good 30 minutes slower); some might find him too prosaic, but I do not.  Unfortunately the sets, while not nonsensical, are rather drab and uninviting, with e.g. one or two tiny saplings standing in for an entire forest.  There is also a bit of nonsense near the end where the Grail Knights are are made to turn on Amfortas and seek to kill him, instead of drawing back from him in distress as the libretto directs.<br /><br />The sets for the 1998 Sinopoli/Bayreuth version are quite striking and effective; despite the use of abstract colored panels for the woodland scenes, they actually succeed in creating a real sense of a dark, richly hued forest.  The costumes likewise are more abstractly stylized but generally effective (except for the suits given to the knights in the Act I Grail scene, which look more like something out of \\"Star Wars\\"); those for Stein/Bayreuth are passable but not more.  Hans Sotin is again an superb Gurnemanz; age haa deepened his vocal texture, but there is no loss of vocal sheen or control.  Poul Elming is an excellent Parsifal, in his all-too-brief prime before his voice became overtaxed and went to seed; his sound is a bit more baritonal than that of Jerusalem.  While Falk Struckmann is a singer I generally do not care for -- too often his vibrato is not under control -- here he is in his best form with minimal defects, with a voice that is darker and more anguished, if not always as steady, as that of Weikl. Ekkehard Wlaschiha (the potent Alberich of the Met Ring under Levine) has the character of Klingsor down pat, but his voice has dried out and hardened to an unpleasant degree, though he is vastly superior to Mazura.  Linda Watson is quite good as Kundry in her  likewise short-lived prime, but she does not have either Meier's magnetism or Randova's intensity, and has the further disadvantage of a somewhat more ample physique.  Sinopoli offers an account of the score as slow or slower than Levine (except for a positively manic opening to Act II), but with superior pacing.  In both Bayreuth productions the chorus and orchestra naturally excel.<br /><br />Taking the casts as overall totalities, for singing I would rank Bayreuth 1981 first as having no weak spots and some very considerable strengths, followed by Bayreuth 1998 and finally the Met in 1992, with the Klingsors making the single biggest difference. When it comes to the conducting, I would rank Sinopoli first, then Stein, and Levine a very distant third.<br /><br />In the end, your choice between these three versions (if you choose to have only one) will depend on the weight you attach to various factors. For the stagings, costumes, and best Gurnemanz and Kundry, go with the Met. For the performance with the best overall singing (including the best Parsifal, Amfortas, and Klingsor) and the most animated conducting, go with Bayreuth 1981. For a performance that strikes a happy medium between those two in virtually every respect, go with Bayreuth 1998. Or else, do the right right thing, spoil yourself, and get all three.<br /><br />A postscript -- can anyone explain how a dozen or more reviews of the 1981 Bayreuth performance got posted on this listing instead?  It confuses the discussion thread and skews the ratings!

B000OVLINI|5.0|I was surprised when a friend of my recommended this book and told me that it had been translated into English. I decided to give it a try as my friend has fantastic taste in books. I was hooked in the first few lines and read every chance I got. I missed the charters when I couldn't read and my family went without clean clothes and hot food for a few days as I fell into this amazing story deeper and deeper. I am telling everyone I know to read this book and am still astonished that it is translated from Spanish!! I wish I could give it a higher score.... Please read this book, you'll be so glad you did!
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I have been doing this for 5 weeks along with working out and have lost 12 lbs.  It is very easy to follow and I don't find the fasting days hard at all.  I drink tons of water and try to do just a good breakfast and dinner.  In the beginning I would have a green veggie at lunch but soon found I could go until dinner.  On the other days I don't feel that I eat as much either my body is changing for the good people are seeing the results and it is slow not as fast as I would like but everyone tells me slow is good it will stay off that way.  This is a way of life and to be honest not a bad way I go for blood work next week so we shall see if it made a difference in my numbers.  Good Luck

We are from the UK, Ireland, Scotland, South Africa and Canada so you can imagine that we all had different opinions about how we were raised and how it applied to the book. Great discussion and I was really impressed how many of us did further research on the topic before our meeting. Highly recommend this book!
B009M4KTEM|4.0|The concert happened one day after Kean College (NJ) 'After Midnight' gig. Like an extention to the night before JGB mixes other tunes it had not played the night before.

B00B2166BS|4.0|As many other pointed out, the cord is very short, I would have really liked it to be a couple feet longer, that's why it gets 4 stars. It charges the Nexus 10 much faster than the standard USB port, plus its a safer charging port for me with my dogs running around the house. The magnets release instead of the tablet falling to the ground when the dogs tail hits the cord.

So much so that one of the characters' personalities has wormed its way into being part of our family's coded lexicon. It's \\"O'Brien,\\" as in: \\"So-and-so would never have noticed such-and-such on her own, except that she's being 'Obrien-ed'.\\" Ha! Excellent TV for a change! (Watched Season 3 on amazon.com for less than the cost of DVD's and I can go back and re-watch as often as I want. Great concept. Thanks, Amazon!)
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Set in the South two years before the Civil War, Django Unchained is about Django, a slave whose brutal history with his former owners lands him face-to-face with a German-born bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz. Schultz is on the trail of the murderous Brittle brothers, and only Django can lead him to his bounty. so, Schultz acquires Django with a promise to set him free once the brothers are captured, dead or alive. Once that happens, Schultz keeps to his promise and sets Django free. Yet, instead of parting ways, Schultz seeks out the South's most wanted criminals with Django by his side. Honing vital hunting skills, Django remains focused on one goal: finding and rescuing Broomhilda, the wife he lost to the slave trade long ago. That, my friends, is where the real story begins...<br /><br />I love Westerns. This one, I have to say, takes the genre to a whole new level. It's fast-paced, deep, and it'll leave you craving for a second one.<br /><br />Django Unchained rocks!

B00BGQ2OYC|3.0|I'll admit that Phoenix had a lot of pressure on them to live up to their previous album Wolfgang Amadeus Puck.  I think Enterainment and Trying to be Cool are their strongest songs on the album.  The other songs seem to lack the fun upbeat tone that they are known for and instead focused on drawn out instrumentals and melodies that aren't as catchy as their previous records.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the band though definitely give it a listen.  You won't find a whole lot of growth from the band but it is nice to see some new music from them.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book but it's different from what I usually read.  I did not get excited or upset at any of it, I just read it.  That is why I'm giving it 3 stars, I feel a good book makes you feel emotions.  I enjoyed Charlie's character, he is unique and inspiring.  The whole book is letters to someone that you will never find out who it is.  I kept waiting for the letters to stop and the whole story to begin, but Charlie's letters are the story.  I'm happy I read it and I look forward to watching the movie.

0385536828|2.0|SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT: I was so excited to see another novel by Mr McEwan, I have read the majority of his books and always found them to be them beautifully written and to have have realistic observations of people's weaknesses. This story was a combination of two previous novels, The Innocent (from 1998!) and On Chesil Beach. Both of these stories were clever and addictive but McEwan has revisited the same themes and added nothing new. In this story he uses the protagonist as a vehicle to view the sexism of the 1970s and the stodgy organization of the British secret service but the story itself is ponderous. The book works on many levels, there is some tongue in cheek comments on writing and the publishing industry embedded throughout the book which made me feel like this was a personal experiment of McEwan's. Not his greatest work but I will still look forward to his next book.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|This book has lots of good information and Chris gives very specific examples that help make the experience (of starting your own business) very tangible. As someone who recently left his day job in pursuit of entrepreneurial success, I am to have added this to my reading list.

B006IR6NH8|2.0|First, when the wheel works, it is great.  I travel 50%+ and this wheel allows me to take my sim-racing hobby on the road.  I also have a G27 & Fanatec wheel.  In terms of sim-racing, I primarily use iRacing.  By comparison, I get the best lap times and performance from the Fanatec ClubSport Wheel, then the G27, and then the SRW-S1.  However, the times are comparable enough to make the SRW-S1 competitive, particularly when traveling.<br /><br />So why the low review; quite simply, the internal design quality is flawed.  The wheel recently stopped working and, after a search online, I have found my problem is not unique and appears to be a common issue.  The cause of the problem is not clear, nor has it been addressed by SteelSeries.  The wheel has worked fine since December 2012 and then, yesterday (April 28, 2013), it was no longer recognized by Windows (8).  It no longer loads the driver, and from the web, it appears the only solution is to send it back for replacement, at your cost, to SteelSeries.<br /><br />So why two stars instead of one.  Because, when it works, it is the best solution for the mobile sim-racer.  Sim-racing, like real-racing can be an expensive hobby.  Four months is far too short to replace a wheel that costs ~$110-120.  However, the wheel itself is the best in its class and if they fix the quality issue, it could easily be a 5 star device.<br /><br />SteelSeries: As this is a known issue, please either develop a firmware update or make the replacement process easier and at your cost.<br /><br />Update: December 2013.  I have now owned 4 (!) of these.  2 have failed and the other two still work fine.  I also see that the wheel is now selling for $69.99.  To me, this is a good deal just realize that you may get only a year's use from it, perhaps less.  That said, for sim racing 'on the road', it is the best device available.  Still a shame that they have not fixed the quality issue.

B00C1BU7V8|5.0|and although I thoroughly enjoyed ARGO, I adored LINCOLN.  I can't get it out of my mind and know I will never grow tired of viewing it again and again.  I felt I actually was in the presence of Lincoln the man and it was the weirdest most wonderful experience.  It just blew me away. Daniel Day became this man to the point of betting he had a hard time letting him go. I was mesmerized by the debates, the backroom negotiations, the whole kit and caboodle!  Yes, there are inaccuracies here and there but what historical cinematic endeavor has ever hit every note without error.  Sally Field, Tommy Lee Jones and James Spader....Oh my, James Spader!  I'm now convinced that Argo was a \\"Hollywood\\" win.  Not to diminish Ben Affleck's work or talent because it was a good movie but I can't now be convinced it was the worthy Oscar win when matched against Lincoln.
B005PK1G76|5.0|I am using this stroller organizer with my City Select stroller. I have the second seat option along with the glider board. I like this stroller organizer because I am able to adjust the location of it depending on if my older toddler is using the glider board or the seat. Just the other day we went to an amusement park and it worked perfectly for our needs. I was able to put a pack of wipes in the center console along with antibacterial soap. My hubby and I each had a cup holder, which was a plus since the Baby Jogger version on a stroller organizer only had 1 cup holder. I am also able to fold the stroller without removing this unit. It is a great value and fits our needs.

B003VKW14Y|5.0|The very recent death of Janos Starker prompts me to repeat here a review I posted on Amazon UK 2 years ago<br /><br />\\"Janos Starker was born in 1924 in Budapest, Hungary. Two of his older brothers perished in the Nazi holocaust, and he himself was interned. A child prodigy, he made his debut aged 11, and caused a sensation when he played the Dvorak concerto aged 14, standing in at short notice for an indisposed soloist. After the War, he went to America at the invitation of Antal Dorati, and was first cello in several prominent orchestras there before branching out as a chamber player in 1951 [most memorably in the 1960s, with Joseph Suk and Julius Katchen], and as a soloist and teacher. He became an American citizen, and was widely recognised as one of the greatest cellists of his generation. He recorded virtually all the great works of the cello repertoire, many of them several times. He has always been closely associated with the Kodaly sonata for solo cello, and has made five sets of recordings of the Bach suites, the pinnacle of the cello repertoire, though only three have been widely available. These are the early 1950s set for Period [just suites 1,3,4 & 6], issued on LP in the UK by Nixa and re-issued by Saga; the mid-60s set for Mercury; and this version for RCA. [In addition, there was a late 1950s EMI set [1, 2, 3 & 5 in mono: 4 & 6 in stereo], and a 1984 digital set for Sefal.]<br /><br />This set, his last, was apparently recorded in 1992, but not released until 1997, originally by RCA. In its present incarnation, it represents astonishing value for money, despite the lack of any notes about the artist or the music. His playing has gained an added nobility and patrician grandeur with the passage of time; and though his earlier recordings - especially the 1963-5 Mercury cycle - may display more fleet-footed energy and excitement, none of them seems to be currently available. In some ways the Mercury cycle may have the edge for its combination of technical brilliance and sheer musicality. Sadly, in its 1992 CD remastering, it was pitched almost a semitone sharp; and though this was corrected for the 2004 Hybrid CD/SACD re-issue, that set is currently unavailable.<br /><br />No-one who loves Starker's playing of these incredible works should hesitate for a moment to acquire this very special, technically excellent recording, particularly at this bargain price. If and when the Mercury set, properly pitched, becomes available again, that too should be acquired. In the meantime, no-one should feel short-changed by these well-recorded, golden and glorious performances. They represent the crowning achievement of his life and work.\\"nd sheer musicality.

B004M3GDI4|4.0|Nice light but feels a bit heavy.  I needed a light for camping that could both illuminate the area around me provide a beam for walking across distance.  This light had both options and a nice setup so you could easily switch from one to the other.  The light itself is a bit big so if you have a problem with something heavy on your forehead perhaps this is not the best option.

B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Summery<br /><br />Theres nothing special about Linh Cinder, shes just young cyborg mechanic who lives with her step mother, two sisters and her best friend android, Iko. When her sister fall ill, she is blamed by her Step mother and sister and gets sent away to be used as a testing subject so her step mother wont have to deal with her anymore.<br /><br />Slowly information about a past she remembers nothing of starts to resurface revealing her true self. On top of that she keeps crossing paths with the soon to be emperor of Beijing and end up with a romance that was destined to never be.<br /><br />My thoughts.<br /><br />I liked this book so much I was too much that I've already started writing half this review before it even finished. I just wanted to say the imagery is amazing. Other then reading my other hobby includes Painting/Sketching and this book has enough descriptions to get me actually itching to draw a picture of what Cinder could possibly look like or the other characters I love the twist and turns that occur in this book. I've read a lot of adaptions to the Cinderella story and most of them where predictable and this wasn't, I love that I keep getting surprised of what is going to happen next. There is no other Cinderella adaption like this. Even the ending got me curious of what happens next, Thank goodness Scarlet (The next book in this Lunar Chronicles) is out and my library is already in process to get it to me before the end of the week.<br /><br />(Written after book was read) There is so much to like about this book from the imagery the way its fast paced, I liked how well the characters were written. I liked that it had a different setting with the whole Dystopia thing, normally when I find a book that's dystopian its based where the US was this book is based in Beijing. With this book what I ended up getting is a book wit humans, cyborgs, androids and aliens. I'm not a big fan of Aliens I believe I've mentioned that before, the only other book I've read with aliens was In The After. Most of what I've come across in this book is different from what I normally read, so this book was kind of out of my reading comfort zone.<br /><br />What I also liked about this book is that it didn't go overboard with romance or that whole love at first sight kind of thing, you can tell there was a interest between the prince and Cinder but it was subtle. Too many YA books go overboard with the romance and this just has a little touch of if which I appreciate. It wasn't over the top and it wasn't too little, it was just enough romance thrown in.<br /><br />My favorite character had to be Iko, yea she only lasted like half the book but that \\"glitch\\" she had gave her a great and funny personality. I almost kept forgetting that she was an android, even Iko would almost forget. \\"I have a glitch, too. Sometimes I forget that I'm not human. I don't think that happen to most androids.\\" (That was from the short story Glitch which is a special bonus in the book. If you would like to check out the Prequel Glitch go here: [...] ) She is the most girlish robot I've ever heard and I like the little comments she says in the book.<br /><br />Originaly posted this review here: [...]ok I've read with aliens was In The After.

B000XUBFE2|4.0|This was one of those books that I didn't really want to read thought it would come out boring and was surprised to find that I couldn't put it down after getting into it. I think that got me into the book was reading some of the quotes that I came across. Any ways, I loved that I got to know many of the characters that they all had their time for a short story to understand who they were. I think of all the characters my favorite was the narrator/ the grim reaper. The way he told the story was well done and I enjoyed it.  This book will leave you in tears, even death warns you about it in the book.<br /><br />Summery:<br />After her mother abandons Liesel Memiger and her brother they are send to live with a foster family in Nazi Germany. Unfortunately on the way her brother dies and she comes across a book that she steals which leads to future book thievery. With the help of her accordian playing foster father Hans, Liesel is taught to read and learns the power of words. As time progress the reader will get a sense of her life as well as many others.

0143119680|3.0|This book had glimmers of promise but when I have to set an assigment for myself that I must (and cannot sleep!) until I read 50 pages a night, then I have to say something's wrong.  This book is a beast.  It had been sitting idle on my bookshelf for ages but I have always kept its image as center-of-the-EW-Bullseye in the back of my mind.  So instead of paying for another Kindle book I figured it was time.  I brought it on vacation with me and because this was a non-Kindle edition, at least 3 women stopped me declaring, \\"OMG. Best. Book. Ever.\\"  It just never clicked with me.  And oh how I wanted it to! I was working so hard to get through it, I was praying there was a great payoff.<br /><br />Instead, I saw an initially strong, independent witch (Diana) morph into weak child-like thing completely dependent on a ions-old vampire (Matthew) who really never proves what it is about himself that is so irresistible.  He definitely radiated an Twilight/Edwardian vagueness of \\"He is as perfect as a marble statue so I will totally die for him!\\"  That flies in a YA book but not a novel of this magnitude.  Instead of the pages of horse-back riding and tea/wine drinking (yes there's a lot) I could have stood for a stronger development of the eternal love on which both of these creatures (Diana, a witch and Matthew a vampire) are basically risking destroying all of humanity for.<br /><br />I liked the history and science aspects of the book.  The author is obviously very knowledgable; a student of art, history and science.  But one bothersome thing about the plot was that the author just kept creating more powers for Diana to fill plot holes and to create artificial drama. By the end of the book, Diana had so many powers I couldn't keep them straight and the book they are investigating (Ashmole) kept developing more meanings.  It just wasn't working for me.<br /><br />Also, the book reminded me of Twilight and Harry Potter throughout but perhaps that's now unavoidable for supernatural stories.  Harry Potter was evident with Diana's dead parents appearing as ghosts in Diana's time of need (they were killed because they were too powerful, sound familiar?) and Twilight with the drawing out of Matthew's character and his and Diana's love.  They meet, do yoga a few times and now they will totally die for each other, OK?!<br /><br />The problem for me lies in the fact that I even had to set myself an assignment to finish the last 50 pages of this book.  After all that, I shouldn't have been able to put it down.  But I could've.  I also could've used a little witchcraft to get through this book faster.  Or a vampire to read it to me.

0439023491|4.0|Catching Fire is an enjoyable sequel to the terrific Hunger Games. Although, at its base, much of the story is a redo of the first, Collins manages to present it in a way where it remains fresh and original. Chock full of thrills and surprises, it's a terrific read and the twist ending is a great set up for the final chapter. Not quite as tense as the first, but it's about as good as any sequel could be. A superb YA adventure, well deserving of all the praise it has received.

B008BM9L72|5.0|another book i can't put down. this is the second time i have read these books and it only took me a week to read them and i wish there was more, i would even read them again .
B0087K3VTW|4.0|I found it hard to give this book a rating because for the most part it was very engaging but left me unsatisfied. The author did a great job setting up the atmosphere, the characters and the storyline.  I particularly liked the premise of the new technology being used to solve an ancient puzzle but I thought the whole thing fizzled with a disappointing conclusion and stranded characters.
B009GEH5NG|4.0|Over the top spectacle hides a blah story.<br /><br />M was very good, but vilians were one dimensional, and predictable.<br /><br />Pierce B. is a great bond. Too bad he didn't have much script to work with.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was my first book by Gillian Flynn after seeing it in so many top selling lists and recommended reads, I decided to give it a go.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, the way it was written alternating between the two characters, and all the twists along the way.  A very enjoyable and hard to put down book.  I will definately be reading more of this authors books.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|When I want a real challenge, I play this game.  I managed to complete it in 7 min. 45 secs.  Haven't been able to repeat it though.  Lately, the best I can do is 9 minutes.  You really have to be in a quiet place and clear your mind of all distractions.  Takes concentration.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Super CD, spend a lot of time traveling in the car on business trips so I know all the words now
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Really great, like all episodes. Looking forward to season three. Streaming the show was excellent and my wife loves the closed captioning
B00003A9QI|5.0|My boyfriend loved the movie, always said he wished he had the soundtrack!  got it for his birthday.  I&#34;m the best girlfriend EVER !
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I loved this book so much. Nicholas Sparks never ceases to amaze me with his beautifully scripted novels. He makes me feel as if I am living it myself.
B003059XNM|5.0|The movie was excellent.. Very different from anything Will has played in the past ,but it proves you can overcome adversity no matter how bad the obstacles may seem.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|An excellent 2 CD package.  Especially if you like the jazz/blues type of acoustic music.  Very enjoyable and - it must be nice to be able to play like that.
B0000669JL|5.0|I LOVE MUSIC.  I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF BOB MARLEY SINCE HEARING ABOUT HIS EARLY DAYS. I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS CD.  I DO RECOMEND IT TO ALL MY FRIENDS.

B000002L68|5.0|I had this soundtrack 2 other times in my past, and both times they got stolen.  You know I must really like it, if I bought it again.<br />Such a different movie, and the songs are the best.
B007ZSBQYE|5.0|I downloaded this game for free from Amazon, and after reading other reviews I thought that this was going to be another crappy game, but I was totally wrong. I am awful at playing video games but this one seems to be at a great challenging level for me. The controls work great! The steering control is perfect! The brake, gas and reverse works great for me on my Toshiba Excite. I love this game and the way it's controlled. My only conclusion for the people that complain about the controls is that they need to learn to drive :).<br /><br />What can I say! I'm a great driver lol
B009KS4XRO|1.0|There are more things in life than playing Bingo.  It as fun for about 5 minutes then realized a walk outdoors would be better!
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I like all of Kathy Reich's novels. She always goes some place exciting. I always learn something in her books.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I was so excited to see it on the Amazon Prime to be able to watch it! I had read the book and was looking forward to watching the movie.
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|Last night my wife and I snuggled up on the couch to finally watch `The Impossible' and wound up both shedding quite a few tears.  At least I wasn't the only one crying this time.  Yes, `The Impossible' is a film designed to yank every one of your heartstrings and evoke a complete outpouring of emotions, and for that it is entirely successful.  In fact, of all the films I've seen in 2012, it is the one that most effectively tapped into my tear ducts.<br /><br />`The Impossible' is one of those films that I'm really shocked was not all over Oscar's ballots last year.  It is tailor made for Oscar and yet only managed a singular nomination for its star, Naomi Watts.  It really deserved more than that.  No, it isn't the best film of 2012, but it is a stunning example of a director taking hold of a true story and making it as impactful as possible.<br /><br />Not a dry eye.<br /><br />The film tells the true story of a family vacationing in Thailand in 2004 when it was hit by a tsunami.  I'm sure we all remember the news coverage of the devastating event.  In fact, I can still see the images in my head of the videos that circulated the internet all those many years ago.  Telling the story of Maria Belon and her family who were separated during the tsunami and who eventually reunited despite varying degrees of distress and agony, `The Impossible' is a heartbreaking and impeccable crafted film that certainly lifts the spirits as much as it crushes them.  From nearly every angle, this film is expertly crafted and served as one of the highlights of my year.<br /><br />The performances are all uniformly exceptional.  Watts, who received an Oscar nomination for her performance, is unforgettable.  The internet kind of beats down on this nomination because Watts lays down a lot.  Yes, she cries and screams and moans and lays there, but she does so remarkably well.  I never once doubted her pain and struggle, both physically and emotionally.  She nailed every ounce of passion and determination, and her smaller more tender scenes are so beautifully toned.  I mean, how can you not wretch with internal pain when she whispers \\"take care of my babies\\"?  But she wasn't the only performance worth noting.  The entire cast was spot on, from Ewan McGregor's soulful take on Henry's tireless resolve to find his family to young Tom Holland's fantastic portrayal of a young man trying to keep his mother's spirit alive despite her waning health.  Holland in particular carries this film to new heights.  He anchors the more schmaltzy scenes and manages to breathe naturalness into them.  He takes away that feeling of manipulation despite the fact that it is a very heavily manipulative film.<br /><br />This is honestly one of the most beautifully shot films of 2012, certainly more impressive than the digitally captured Oscar winner.  The way that each detail is perfectly captured in the right light, it's a marvelous thing to watch.  The underwater moments are devastatingly grimy, and the sun soaked atmosphere surrounding the wreckage and the cluttered hospitals are a perfectly balanced mix of rawness and polish.  And let's not forget about that musical score.  The best thing about musical incorporates in a film are that they can draw out an emotional response.  Whether it scare, entice, titillate, dramatize or devastate, music has the ability to transport us somewhere, and when accompanied by the right visual it can complete a scene and drive home a deeper impact.  The score created by Fernando Velazquez marvelously captures not only the heartbreak of desperation and the stunning swells of emotional uplift, but it cleverly trickles in an almost `Jaws' like aura of fear with regard to the water, even early on in the film.  It is a very complex score despite the simplicity, and it is possibly the most effective use of music I've seen in a film this year.<br /><br />Listen, the complaints that came over this film have a certain leg to stand on, but not a very strong one.  What director Bayona and screenwriter Sanchez were able to accomplish here was beautifully grounded and heartbreakingly sincere.  Watching one family's desperate attempt to reunite, to survive, to make it through has the power to lift the spirits and give us hope in the power of the human spirit.ong one.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game is absurdly fun, has so much strategy and variance, and has very high quality game pieces. Saving up for the expansions already!
B0014DCT06|4.0|The bluray works just fine, and the only thing I did not like was that the cover on the front of the box had a slight tear.  No problems though with the actual play of the blueray.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Very good series. Keeps your interest. I always can't wait to begin the next episode. Lots of twists and turns. Keeps you guessing who is the real villain.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|its fun to read a classic as adult versus reading a book in high school that is a required read
B006W0QR1S|5.0|I loved every second of this movie. There are plenty of comprehensive reviews that are more eloquent than mine can ever be but I feel so passionate that I felt I had to at least add to the stars if only as a vote. I absolutely loved the movie.
B004W1GCQO|4.0|Public broadcasting always gives us good stories and the actors are great.  Downton Abbey is very similar.  I would recommend this to any fans of Downton.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|This album is great.  Love the songs. Lyrics are great and music. I am very happy with this album.  Depeche Mode out done themselves once more.
B00633W614|5.0|Archer has the ability to grip a gigantic hold on the readers interest in the book at the beginning and carry it through to the end.<br /> Family and Friends relationships are interwoven in the plot to keep one Glued to each Chapter and page.
1451629184|5.0|Sad, but a very strong little girl that became a stronger woman. It is an unbelievable journey that this child went through. Makes you mad and cry at the same time.  Very strong book.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|I like the show so far. However, at times it seems a bit over the top, but it is keeping me interested thus far. We will see how season 2 turns out.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This was a catchy book, there was some slow parts but overall it was pretty good! You really feel for the characters.
B009ME47H2|5.0|I was in the middle of a meeting and forgot my note pad to take notes, so during the meeting, I whipped out my kindle fire clicked on this app to download. The download took no time at all to download. Also it is easy to handle and the recording was clear.<br /><br />I love this app and I will recommend anyone to purchase it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It won't let me read the book so i don't know how the book really is so I need to read it first
B000I55YV2|5.0|A really awesome movie, cast and screenplay, great acting.  Suspenseful and funny!  The only thing about the standard DVD is POOR video quality.  I wound up buying the Blu Ray version--much better.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|need more levels. and need bouns levles and more people and I though I've unlocked the sorceresses.for free I did not but I saved her.
B008458O3S|5.0|A very cleaver game, it makes you think and it's fun to play.  Addictive and hard to stop playing  the game.
B009DT98RK|5.0|I went and saw this tour when it came to Calgary Alberta, and therefore had to snag the video.  Peter Frampton lost his original guitar in a plane crash, but has it back for parts of this.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Good detail and the book explains each word thoroughly<br />and tells you the meaning in a easy understandable way. That's why I likened the \\"New Oxford American Dictionary. Good Job People. I love y'all dearly. Bye
B0019N95IK|4.0|1) See a Japanese dubbed version in Japan.<br />2) It is cheaper than a Japanese version.<br />These were very good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the[[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]  graphics is really good you can change your players and there really awesome run in different places too like Sydney or Rome.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Another great GRRM book.  My only criticism is that the story has slowed down significantly and the plot seems to be going at a very slow pace.  That aside, great book overall and even better book series.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Wonderful sequel!!!! Even better than the maze runner. Some of the fastest reading I've ever done to get finished!!! It was awesome!!!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love Angry Birds. It's quite fun :) And you totally need an LOTR edition! That would be so awesome :)
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|Had intent and pushed the agenda rather than allowing one to draw one's own conclusions.  I found this to overshadow the beauty of the cinematography.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I love me some Benedict Cumberbatch! This is a wonderful series and shockingly little-known. I thought the writers did a magnificient job of updating Doyle's terrific work.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Captures the humor and feel of high school without being too broad.  The characters are well developed although the main character should make a mistake or two to be a little more believable.
B00881PTRC|4.0|I liked the funny illustrations, keeps the game interesting.<br /><br />When one loses and it fills in the remaining letters in a word, it uses a bright yellow font color that can be difficult to see.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|This final volume of the WOT was a fitting end to the series.  All of the major characters were dealt with and there were definitely a few surprises along the way.  If I had one complaint, it would just be the overall length of the final battle scenes in the back half of the book as they were a bit overly long.  That said, very happy with the ending!  Thank you Brandon Sanderson for finishing this great series for RJ!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Doesn't stand up as well as some of the other books in the series. More description, less involvement, doesn't inspire as much interest int he characters or true emotion as the earlier books.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Riveting plot, believable characters who I as the reader cared about, very well-written novel/mystery combination.  I highly recommend this book.
B00499NHLC|5.0|just finished the 4th eppisode and can't wait for the next one. Intrigue, drama, comedy and just plain good writing. Love it!
B0044C5SCU|5.0|If you like sci-fi this is one of the best sci-fi shows ever. Period. The first year doesn't start the big picture until pretty late but from there on it rocks and rolls. You'll be surprised, I think, by how much you invest in the characters. And you will enjoy it wildly.
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|Received watch prior to promised date. I question whether it was indeed a &#34;new&#34; watch due to some packaging issues such as broken seal, missing instructions, tag not attached to watch, and plastic seal missing from back of watch.<br />That being said, the watch is in new condition as far as I can tell. I have had it just shy of a week and I have not had to reset it. It looks great, is comfortable to wear although I may invest in a different band.<br />The ability to see the time at night is a bonus although it is not quite as bright as I anticipated.<br />I have been wanting another Seiko Diver's Automatic for many years. My first purchase of one of the early models was in 1972 when I was working in the Marshall Islands and doing a lot of Scuba diving. It was my favorite watch for years but finally needed repair. When I took it in for repair, the center was unable to get the proper seals for it so it would fog up if I used it so I put it in the vault. One of these days I will pull it out and see what model it is and if it has any value. It served me well and I hope this new one will too.
B00992CF6W|5.0|most fun game ive ever played. awesome. I love it. like a boss. I'm so excited for 0.6.2. so fun
B004LROUNG|4.0|Love John Grisham's writings. Always find his plots give reason to read on!<br />I would recommend his books to be on your collection list!
B004PIA4BI|1.0|it worked for a few days then it  kept dying after charging for more than 6 hrs it will work then as soon as one use the phone it dies quickly within minutes, i think i got a used or bad  battery.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is absolutely perfect for those of you who love Batman. I love everything about the trilogy and I was very excited to have it.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|A beautiful 3-dimensional portrait of an American hero... A great film to show every middle schooler in the US; they would definitely connect to the Civil War, our early Congress and human rights, not to mention one of our greatest presidents!
0374531269|4.0|A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier by Ishmael Beah was an intense, truly heartbreaking memoir of a 12 year old boy soldier in the war torn country of Sierra Leone. This dark story lets readers see the horrific challenges children of war torn countries face. Ishmael gives readers a snapshot of his life including the graphic and horrendous details of drugs, murder, rape and torture. Ishmael was a witness and a part of true evil that no child should ever have to live through.<br /><br />The problems of the world are brought into light and lets readers see the real issues are not just war, but violence against women and children. The exploitation of children is the true epidemic that leaders of the world need to acknowledge and make giant immediate steps to help them so children like Ishmael can live a peaceful life.<br /><br />Ishmael truly wrote an eye opening piece that does not sugar coat the violent happenings of the world yet sheds the light onto a topic that needs all the attention it can get. I find this story uplifting, dispite the evils of war, because it shows us that true postive transformation of a person can happen regardless of unimagineable circumstances.
B004LZFWJO|5.0|This game is addictive.  I play daily and enjoy the competition with self.  After hitting high score, then you automatically try to improve on previous score.  It never ends bug it is fun.
B002HVGFP4|1.0|I paid extra for a specific edition, but instead was sent the latest printing. All books are not created equal!
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|Fun and addicting! I sat down and played half the game in one day! My little girl (she's 5) loves it too!
B008XCF7Y6|1.0|Thought it was a movie but more like a game, was disappointed.  Not what I expected.  I would not recommend

B0009P5YXO|2.0|it's difficult to tell from the product description and pictures, but the item is relatively cheap plastic and is NOT worth the price paid...maybe at half the price.  Maybe.<br /><br />Serious cosplayers may want to explore other options, as this flimsy item feels fragile.  More suited for a child, as the recommended age on the package states, but at that price?  No.
B00BOLFRKW|1.0|I really wanted to like this..<br /><br />It was pretty much a schoolhouse-rock episode about the 13th amendment, except it wasn't entertaining in the least.<br />A drab Documentary of the 13th amendment.<br /><br />I liken it to a person who has an important job that produces important results.<br />Let's just say a brain surgeon saving lives daily for instance.<br /><br />I make a move called \\"Brain Surgeon\\" and the whole movie of about 3 hours is about the guy getting to work, filling out various forms and paperwork, looking over the day's caseload, discussing various patients with co-workers, and otherwise trying to get things prepared to do surgeries that day.. and during the last half hour of the film, we'll show the doctor enter the surgical room and don his scrubs, and then we'll cut to the scene where he goes to the recitatives saying it was a success and everyone cheers and is happy.<br /><br />May be a factually correct movie, about an important person and the important work, but what's to be gained from watching it? much like this movie, not much.<br />All I got from is was that politics with dems and repubs were fighting each other then as they still are today.<br /><br />Tony!
B006ID01OS|5.0|This book is full of real world, current and most importantly relevant business cases that back up the principles introduced in the book. Also, unlike most business books this one is fun to read!
B000FC12SM|4.0|I especially enjoyed the part about how to ask for support in the right way, looking forward to trying out the techniques mentioned in the book.

B00BGIC2J2|5.0|This was a good film for all of those parents who are pushing 40... My wife and I laughed through almost the whole movie...
B0042J6VUS|3.0|It is a good idea but is a little unstable for my itouch and projector combination. It tips over quite often and one of the legs keeps coming off.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|The movie was so long... the scenes were dragged out, so much unnecessary slow-mo walking/scenes in general... This story could have been told in 1hour 45min tops and it would have been a kick a** flick...
B00821OW8K|5.0|I watched all of season 1 this weekend, and am looking forward to watching season 2. This is great sci-fi. The back story is a bit mysterious, but is being rolled out little by little through each of the characters. The aliens are interesting, and different than aliens of past movies and shows. The story with the characters flows well, and there is lots of action. Special effects are great! I highly recommend!
B003H4I4JU|4.0|Not as good as the first. Be warned that it takes place a long time later, and the entire millieux is different. Tone is different. Ender is still Ender though, and that is what counts.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Supernayural is always a good buy. I'm glad to buy them here because they are so much more expensive elsewhere.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I had avoided this book for some reason for at least 20 years. Not sure what put me off of it, but hearing the movie was coming, I figured I better get around to this one. So worth it. Great read.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Really good stories and complex characters. Some I love to hate or hate to love. Nice job showing how evens affect generations in a different way. also shows how different classes are affected by historical events. I really want another season!
B007ZSBQYE|2.0|I like the simple idea and goals, graphics are fine, but the controls are really bad and on hi-tech displays, such as the HTC One, the interface is far too small.  It's almost impossible to see, let alone use.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|thought it would be a casual diversion.  Ended up being addictive.  Sort of like slot machines. Can't wait to see what pride comes out next.

B009ZXT4BY|5.0|Son downloaded this app and seemed to like it a lot. Demo allows limited use before you have to buy the full version.
B009K0P10K|5.0|This show is great! Nice evolution of female characters- I mean that it's refreshing to see intelligent complicated characters instead of the flat always good Snow White types against the always bad Evil Queen types. Nothing is what it seems and smart twists keep you coming back for more!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Pretty amazing how much time my sone can spend on this, but he goes in and out of fads so quickly. He is very creative and can create some crazy stuff. Elevators, waterfalls, rollercoasters, etc. wicked easy to use, and simple. The only thing that seems to bog the processor down is the TNT when he explodes something. Creative tool, like digital LEGO but more sophisticated and creative.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|No parent wants to believe their child is capable of a horrific crime.  I found it interesting how differently these parents reacted to Jacob's potential guilt.
030758660X|5.0|There are so many books and how-to's out there for knitters that don't explain the pattern well - NOT THIS BOOK!

B0037VNX44|2.0|a massively artsy film about someone it would take 3 minutes in droll detail to describe his entire life. too bizarre of a format for my taste with not a lot of interesting story line.
0544002318|5.0|If you are asking &#34;Is this book all about being vegan&#34;, the answer is a resounding NO. Jurek takes the reader through his life, and his progression to the ultra runner he is today. At the end of each chapter he includes vegan recipes, ranging from recovery meals, to race snacks. This is a great read for anyone, runners and non runners alike.
B000ICM0YY|5.0|Everyone reviewing this set has praised it. Deservedly so; yet I have always missed mention of one element that struck me the first time I heard a movement from it. Let me put it this way: When you hear Kempff, Barenboim, Arrau (or any number of other pianists) playing these sonatas, you are always aware of hearing Kempff etc, playing Beethoven, sometimes wrestling with Beethoven or searching. The first man to do this, Arthur Schnabel, put his personal imprint on this music to an extent we would hardly condone today. The one exception prior to Gilels was Wilhelm Backhaus, who plays in such a self-effacing manner that you can't discern a \\"Backhaus imprint\\". Probably one reason why most pianists look up to him and find it inimitable. Some, like Kovacevich, are so self-conscious about not making a personal mark on the music, that occasionally he slips into the most grotesque egoism.<br />To come to the point: What struck me about Gilels is that for the first time ever I seemed to hear the voice of Beethoven, unadultered. I don't mean Beethoven's piano ( which I think is a trivial concern). I mean that, through Gilels' pianism, I seem to be put in receptive communication with that spirit, as no other pianist has ever done for me.<br />I happen to believe that this is the greatest accomplished one might ever ask of a musician.<br />Whether this makes Gilels \\"the greatest\\" I leave for you to decide. for me, his playing revealed aspects of Beethoven's music that I had not experienced before. I think every lover of Beethoven should expose him- or herself to this kind of experience. Not to do so would be missing on something essential that sound recordings may do for us: so to speak the only good excuse for having sound recordings at all.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Great acting and storyline. Yes, it's dark and twisted and I hope nothing like this ever happens, but I'm captivated.
B000003ER4|4.0|Potential buyers should at least be alerted to two features of the opera, which is not really like what you would expect from the usual comments about cross between Strauss and Puccini. It would be more appropriate to say: a cross between Lehar and Puccini, with a bit of Alban Berg thrown in. The story line is woefully idiotic, but most of the music is rich and colourful, not to say overripe and opulent. Frankly the \\"Lehar\\" episodes drive me mad, they stick out like a sore thumb, whereas \\"Berg\\" fits in perfectly.<br />Leinsdorf, who normally tends to be somewhat cut and dried, here adopts an almost opposite stance. The result is an extraordinarily lavish orchestral canvas. One could easily come to the belief that he loves Korngold's score more than any other. The sound, despite its age, is translucent, all the details of this rich score comes through. So no complaints in this department. Listeners accustomed to digital might find a little constricted, but one gets used to it quickly.<br />The cast is variable. René Kollo gives a good protrayal, as he should, having been a pop singer before he turned to opera. His voice is not especially agile, and he has no genuine top. It is not a performance that would thrill you, and he has a habit (also discernible in his Wagner roles, where they sound utterly inappropriate) of degenerating into vaudeville. Mind you, the plot invites this kind of thing. In contrast, the mellow baritone of Hermann Prey caresses the ear with its mellifluous tones. Unfortunately he only has one 'song', a kind of circus ballade, and Frank Sinatra would have done it just as well. Benjamin Luxon's role is mostly sing-song speaking, so there isn't much to say; whjereas Rose wagemann has a deep alto voice that seems ideal for the lines she has to sing. Her's is in fact the first really singing voice we hear, and she makes a good start to proceedings.<br />This leaves us with the heroine. Well, she ain't no Maritza! Still, as long as she sings in her natural register, she produces some lovely tones. Rising up into higher regions, her voice gets pinched. Not ideal.<br />As far as I know, this is the only recording of the work in modern stereo. It is, from a singing point of view, less than perfect. I could imagine Jessye Norman thrilling me where Nesbitt has me worried if she's going to make it. I think Nicolai Gedda would have thrilled me as the hero, while Kollo leaves me cold. So the real hero of this recording is Leinsdorf. I can't imagine another conductor with so much flair of the Viennese kind - committed, but not overly serious, and revelling in the glories of the orchestral writing.<br />Finally, a word of praise for Charles Gerhardt, whose production is stylish, but discreet. How easy it would been to exaggerate the effects.<br />So in all, if you can cope with a story that's sillier than even the proverbial silly opera plot, there is plenty of well-performed, beautiful music to enjoy.
B005ES12S2|4.0|I wear Crocs all the time. I stay with the traditional style Classic. I tried the Duet Sport because of the thick sole. My only observation is that one shoe is slightly tight and uncomfortable. These shoes do not have the bedroom slipper comfort of the traditional Crocs but are still a god product. I will be cautious about buying again.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Could not put the book down.  The show does an amazing job following the books, but the books give so much more depth.
B009AMANBA|3.0|Soso
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Can't put the book down.  Keep em coming. Quite possibly one of the best series of books that I have read in a long time.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked this book.  Not only did it provide a good mystery with some twists and turns, but it  was an interesting story about marriage  and what can go so wrong in a relationship that starts out so right.  The characters are well defined and the changing timeline is easy to follow.  Even when you think you have it figured out, there are some surprises.  Recommended read.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love the piano guys, they are so talented, their music makes the day go by alot smoother. 1000 yrs is my fave.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|This book was very adventurous and I like how Cassia tried her hardest to find ky. But it did feel like they were growing apart as they found each other and the farther they got into the carving. It seemed a little awkward to me.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|This show has a strong female lead, some odd, and eccentric characters. Can life exist on different planes? How much should scientists tamper with humanity and nature? These are questions I find myself asking. Great show for science fiction fans.
B0000025H6|5.0|One of my favorite Pink Floyd albums of all time. The album still holds up, even thirty years after the original release. If you consider yourself a Floyd fan YOU should own this record.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is a very fun game with a lot of details i love it. me and my friends play it
1842171593|5.0|A very scholarly book, very well researched. The only criticism would be about the illustrations. I'd suggest, for future editions, to accompany the drawings with the actual photos.
B004H4XDBI|4.0|I think these books give you a different perspective on coma patients and where they go when they are no longer responding in their bodies.  They are fast reads and take you through a journey of horrible loss and a happy ending, even if it is not the happy ending you were expecting, as in life.
0062502174|5.0|It works as a story, and it works as a philosophy lesson.  As a story, it reminds me of the Call of the Wild, which I read as a teenager and again recently, many decades later, and still found exciting.  As a philosophy lesson it reminds me of The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran.
B005J9ZFQG|5.0|Love that it was a reboot, since you couldn't really do a sequel based off of the ending of the first one. In any case, everything arrived as advertised and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Good on ya.
0790729393|2.0|It was not my cup of tea. I was excited and intrigued but soon found myself suffering along with this awful tale. The talented actors seemed wasted and weighed down by the trauma of the film.  there was little emotional vindication or resolution, just continued feelings of victimization, fear and eventual death.  NOBODY COMES AWAY CLEAN FROM THIS FILM, NOT THE CHARACTERS OR THE AUDIENCE WATCHING.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This puzzle game is a lot of fun to play. It is easy for the lower number of pieces and hard for the higher number.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I loved this book. It was funny and smart. I didn't put it down from start to finish. I recomend it to others.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Well worth purchasing....we don't have T.V. so we needed to use Amazon prime to see it.  Loved it!  Get it!
B000W4D94I|5.0|My grandson had rented the DVD and when I saw the quality of the blue ray over the regular DVD, I was amazed.  It is an old movie so I was really delighted to find it available.
B009PMB3CI|3.0|My 2yo loves this app! The downside is that after playing for a while, it freezes up and I can't fix it. I've uninstalled and reinstalled twice with the same issue. Wish it would work like it should!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Best movie I've seen in a long time. After watching I immediately bought and read all of the books, and though they are short they were incredible.  The only complaint that I have is that the movie makes the plot seem less original than it is.  The book is original even by todays standards and written over 100 years ago.  Can't wait for the next movie.
B00C7KXUOE|4.0|This show is exciting and cerebral. As a Dexter fan, I can really appreciate this style of film. I'm adding it to my watch list.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love pinterest, however lately the app has been difficult, it keeps stopping and asking if I want to wait or force a close. most of the time the wait is no more than a minute, but happens a lot... way to much. a couple times when I click a photo it wont even open it, it'll just close the app, so then I either just forget about pinning that or have to get on my computer, irritating. I'm on the kindle fire.
0345803507|5.0|It was a great love story beyond all the other stuff. I wasn't sure Id I was going to like them, but I'd highly recommend all three books!! Loved them all!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Not much to say. Really just thoroughly enjoyed this book. I thought it was well written, entertaining, and informative. Tough to put down.
B000P6PVLC|5.0|Way, way up there in my forever Top 10 best films.  Ever more relevant as time passes, but evidently not for those who dislike plots that twist and turn, and want everything presented in neat, straight line sequence. Suspenseful intertwined and sometimes heartbreaking storylines, with great acting all around. I highly recommend it, but there's just no predicting whether someone will like this film or not.  This is one you where you have to just ignore reviews and make up your own mind.  A compelling, important film you have to judge for yourself.
B005COO1X6|2.0|Story was not like anything else I have read by Stephen king slow and just not very good. Overall boring
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|i have to say one thing. i have been looking for a horror movie for age that will creep the hell out of me and i think i found it. this is the creepiest and most disturbing horror movie i've seen since the exorciest. i like this movie for one reason there is no blood or guts and the supernatural bad guy mr. boogie is not always in the center and the home movies were just freaky. i loved it because it was just creepy seeing ethan hawke just sit in the dark watching those films. i will have to say this movie had a good twist. if you are looking for a movie that will give you chills rent this film. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|I loved Jessica Chastain in this movie. It was well-written and well-acted. Even though you knew how it turned out it was still very suspenseful.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|And they've only performed better & better. A radio-industry buddy of mine said these were the only way to go, so I tried it, never made a better purchase decision.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this novel about the enduring faith of the human spirit.  Even though the story is complete fiction, there are parallels that I believe each individual reader can relate to in some way as each of us meander our way through life's challenges of relationships and overcoming difficult events.  I love books that stir the soul... and this one did... it was heart wrenching as much as it was up-lifting.  Wonderfully written as well... the story seemed to carry you through it as if you were floating along on a mild current of water.  Highly recommend it.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Once the action gets rolling it doesn't stop. The descriptive dialogue flows into your mind and carries your eyes through each page with wonderment.
B00AFEYUVG|3.0|I missorderd this not realizing it was Blu-Ray...so had to send it back...otherwise a really cute movie!  I would recomend it!
B0055OG2BC|4.0|Required watching for the James Bond fan. It's a classic. Laughing so hard, almost cried. They don't make them like that anymore.
0316223239|5.0|The topic is an unspeakable one. But the author portrays the details of a horrible crime in a tender and sensitive way. Told through the narrative of a boy just turned five, Room, by Emma Donoghue, is both shocking and captivating.<br /><br />The narrator, Jack, has never been outside of Room. He has lived his entire life believing the small space he and his mother occupy is all there is of the world. He knows only what his mother teaches him. The small glimpse of Outside delivered by the television is confusing and Jack is told that it isn't real. Jack's mother is the victim of a despicable crime. Her heroic self-preservation for the sake of her son is heartwarming and heart-wrenching.<br /><br />Despite the objectionable topic, Room is rich in character development and reveals many aspects of the victim's situation and its psychological effects during and after the crime. Jack's childish understanding proves to be both insightful and unclouded.
B00AEFXESQ|5.0|This was a great movie that I saw years ago, and I'm still intrigued by it today.  So much so that I had to get the dvd, so I could watch it again.  It has some fascinating twist's and turn's in the story, and keep's you on the edge of your seat.  Kevin Spacey get's into the feel of his character and Annette Bening is terrific as his Wife, and they are so awesome together. Their Daughter, her best friend and the Father and Son next door neighbor's put on a fabulous performance too.  It's funny, sad, disturbing, surprising and has quite a tragic ending.  It's like a roller coaster ride that keep's on going and going non stop.  It might not be a movie that will appeal to everyone, but if you're looking for a great movie that's a little different than the ordinary, check this one out.  I would definitely recommend it.  Thanks!
B00008IHN1|4.0|This is an &#34;ok&#34; movie for adults-- probably better for teens - but I purchased it to show my young grandson the wonders of playing a drum.  For that, it is great!
B0042816YK|5.0|I happen to see this movie on t.v. the other day for the first time, and I was really amazed how much I enjoyed it.  I missed the very beginning, so I didn't even know the name of the movie until I searched for it on the internet.  I had never read the book, and I had never heard of the movie either.  I think Julia Roberts is a great actress, and have loved everything I've seen her in.  But, I guess this movie never got much attention, or maybe the name wasn't something that attracted movie goers to see it.  I can honestly say it was a wonderful heartfelt movie about a woman, who after a bad time in her life, went on a journey to find inner peace.  The countries she visited had some beautiful scenery and lots of adventure, and there were so many wonderful surprises in store for her during her journey.  I understand it was a movie based on a true story, and I just had to have the dvd so I could watch it again from the beginning.  What a &#34;Happy Surprise&#34; this movie turned out to be.  Thanks!
B00062IDCO|5.0|Score another great series for Trekkies (I am over thirty so I can use that word) and Trekkers for the rest of you.
B00AFEY354|5.0|I have a friend who has watched this at least 15 times. Such a great movie. So irregular, but so normal, for highschool.
B00354YA2M|5.0|This has to be the funniest book written by Bill Bryson, and a must-read for anyone with an interest in Australia
B003O86FMW|4.0|It was a good book you should read it but read the first one before you read this on it will make  more sense
B003X27L9U|5.0|A fantastic read, exciting, charming, harrowing- I couldn't put it down. A definite recommendation for holidays/bus journeys but not for bed-time reading- you will not be able to put it down!
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Love him, great awesome show..........Great special effects. Characters are great  all in all it is my favorite sysfy show GREAT
B003P2WJ6S|4.0|Although I did not particularly like the author's style, I really enjoyed the story. As a scientist, I found it really intriguing to be forced to think about the origin of the tissues that we use regularly for research. It is also a very sad tale of the impact of poor education and low income on the lives of many. The ethical questions posed within this book resonate with you for a long time after you finish reading
B000FC0V3E|1.0|Starting on page 24, about every third page of this ebook is complete gibberish.  Whoever converted this title for Kindle is completely incompetent.  You expect this sort of thing in self-published books or public domain books, but after having paid $10 for this, I expected to at least be able to read every word of the original text.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the series! It is so authentic, scenes are beautiful, and acting is wonderful!! It is a pleasure to watch and can't wait till next season.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I had not watched this program at all until the final episode of Season 3.  As I watched, I was wondering why I hadn't been watching it all along.  That one episode convinced me I had been missing a truly interesting series and one well worth my time.<br /><br />I purchased Season 1 and 2 immediately and, when I had seen all those episodes, I purchased Season 3.  I was NOT disappointed.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|This game is an absolute winner.  It is fun, challenging, easy to play and worth every penny.  Kudos to the maker.

B00BESNKB8|2.0|It was inspired by RZA's love of old kung fu movies, but it shows his need to develop a better sense of tone and unity with his storytelling.  The action sequences and the imagination were there, but there wasn't much else aside from style to make this movie worth watching.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I love courtroom dramas, and this is a very good one. But then towards the end, it made me suck in my breath and say, &#34;OMG!&#34; aloud! Can't ask for much more than that. I loved it.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This is the easiest-to-use online dictionary I've seen yet, and I've tried several. Very handy to have ! Good book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I normally don't read a lot of sci-fi books, but I accidentally came across Wool when I was searching for a different title series. The description of the series caught my interest, so I tried the sample, and ultimately bought/read it.  Bottom line is I loved it.  I know a book has captured my attention when I really feel like I am experiencing the situations and conditions in first-person with the characters while reading it, as opposed to being a casual observer from a distance.  I was completely submersed in the world of Wool.<br /><br />Now, on to Hugh Howey's &#34;Shift&#34; series to see how this world of Wool started.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I still find that I cannot put the book down. Great start so far. Hoping to find out what is &#34;wrong&#34; with Crhistian's past.
B00AWJYJVA|4.0|A public / private snatch operation of a terrorist leader on Gibralter goes badly wrong with civilians being killed.<br /><br />Three years later one of the members of the operation approaches others involved to assist in going public with events as he has been hung out to dry by his masters.<br /><br />From here the 'system\\" begins to close in on the three who have decided to bring the failed operation to public attention.<br /><br />The book has a very small cast of characters but the way it is written there is a continual build up of tension right to the end.  It almost a 'tilting at windmills' tale as three or four men decide to follow their conscience rather than take easy options which are made to them.<br /><br />A great cameo from a character called 'Brigid' fantastic dialogue from her.<br /><br />All in all it shows that Mr Cornwell still has what it takes to write a decent thriller even though he is becoming more overt and much less subtle in a dislike for certain aspects of government.<br /><br />Not a huge book or a long read but money well spent.
0439023521|4.0|A book about a bunch of kids killing each other? Last one standing wins? I began reading with a bit of skepticism, but the unusual present tense gave the story a sense of immediacy and quickly drew me in. I enjoyed Collins's language, jarringly sparse in the action scenes and beautifully descriptive and symbolic at the rare moments of lull. Fast-paced and actioned packed.<br /><br />However, while containing deeper and better developed characters than Twilight, the story was still at its core surprisingly shallow for modern YA, which is supposed to appeal to adults as well as teens. The main character Katniss, while not happy with her situation, never bothers to question it or consider how things could be different. While survival is naturally the number one thing on her mind, her inability to look past it to what could be made her very unlikable for me. Also, the fact that Katniss set out ready and willing to kill anyone who stood in the way of her winning made me stop caring whether she lived or died. If she had started out with the intention of just watching and waiting, biding her time while the others duked it out, I would have liked her a lot better. I also didn't quite buy her angst at the end. She just survived the hunger games, and all she can think about is whether to like Pita or the other guy. That didn't seem consistent with her character and her ability to fake almost anything. Overall, I tend to like more uplifting books, anyway, so I'm probably not the target audience.<br /><br />That being said, however, the novel is perfect for an adrenaline junkie and a fast read. The world is carefully crafted but not obtrusively so, and I felt right in the middle of the action. A great start to the series.
B005KELW26|2.0|I did not purchase this item through Amazon, but at a Target retail store<br /><br />CONS:<br />-does not provide any protection if you drop your kindle<br />-seams not very well made, many loose strings after a short time of owning it<br />-the seemingly nice velvet-like material on the inside wears down very quickly<br />-no screen protector<br />-one of the four 'tabs' that keeps the kindle in place blocks the light sensor<br />-the tabs all allow crud to collect under them<br />-the case allows any material to get in between your kindle and the front part of the case, which can lead to scratches without a screen protector<br />-the speakers are covered by the tabs, not very good for sound quality<br />-case allows the kindle to get very hot, acts as an insulator<br /><br />PROS:<br />-provides some protection from the outside environment<br />-made from nice looking leather-like material<br />-elastic has not worn down

B00AQM8H9I|3.0|I'm not a gamer but, I do like a few games on my phone to help pass time when necessary.  This game looked easy and cute but, the instructions are lacking because it doesn't seem to do what the instructions say it's supposed to do.  The graphics are colorful and cute.  I will probably try it a few more times before I uninstall it but so far, I'm disappointed.

B0091REZMW|4.0|I love the beautiful rooms. the characters are interesting and funny sometimes. I love that the game has so many different elements: monsters robots romance etc.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Not escapism.  This well written fiction engages the reader on an intellectual and emotional level from the start.  You can't help but care about the main characters.  It avoids all the easy cliches and forces the reader to reconsider the concepts of good and bad, right and wrong.  Very engaging read.  You won't be the same after you've read it.
B003VANOFY|5.0|These are my favorite that I have ever seen or listened to. The surround sound blows my mind. They are very durable as well.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love mindcraft I play it on Xbox and computer and now my kindle it is so much fun you have to get this game
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This is the perfect case for my kindle. I got one for my husband in black and one for myself in purple. We both love it! Works beautifully!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Very fun and very addictive. I could sit here and play this game all day, In fact I do. I recommend this game. Even if u don't like it, just remember it's free. But once u try it you will get hooked.

B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This game is very fun and educational but if you don't want to spend money, time is money. My only complaint is some of plants, coral, fish and so on take too long to evolve and produce. I would play more often if it didn't take so long to progress. On the plus side, it continues through time even when you are not playing. GREAT GAME!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Very good concept, my son love the chasing. The animation is cute and task are easy to follow. Fun and entertaining.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|How could anyone not like the original classic Star trek?  Good seeing it again and brought back memories of watching the reruns after school in the 70's.
B00886XQO0|3.0|Bought this headset thinking it would be an upgrade from the PX5 headset Turtle Beach sells. The surround sound seems a bit better in these I would say. Unfortunately the Tango's seem to be made of a weaker plastic. The cushioning for the top of the head seems less comfortable than the PX5's as well. Didn't like the default voice notifications but you can change those out easily. Overall they're an excellent headset but I would get the PX5's again rather for the cheaper price and better build quality.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|one of the better novels I have read in a long time, the unique perspectives and the non linear way the story is told in fantastic!<br />I strongly recommend this to anyone who loves a good novel.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follett never disappoints.  These characters carry on the depth brought to us in Fall of Giants.  Such rich storytelling & emotion.  I also love the fine woven mesh of fiction with well researched historical facts.
B005LW5J9O|1.0|This is a wonderful book, but the kindle interface has ruined the experience of reading it. When trying to touch the screen to move forward, many times the screen moves to the end notes, forcing the reader to go back to the beginning and reconstruct the right location.  This is frustrating and maddening. It's a serious flaw in the software. If could return the kindle edition for a paperback, I would.
B008NMT684|5.0|My 2.5 year old can entertain herself on this one. Easy to use and celebration balloons are a perfect speed for her to pop all of them.
B000BNX4MC|5.0|Decades after it came out, Ferris Bueller's Day Off is as great as ever! I love this movie so much, and not just because I was right out of high school when it was released. It's a great comedy. It's downright brilliant! John Hughes was a visionary, just a fantastic director. The casting, and therefore the acting, is spectacular. The story is funny. This DVD has some extras, although apparently it lacks one that an earlier DVD release had -- thus some negative reviews of this particular version. As I haven't seen the earlier one, this DVD is more than enough for me. It's great to see what's happened with these people over the years. Matthew Broderick plays one of the greatest roles of his career in this film, and it's really worth watching. Highly recommended.
B0018CENUC|2.0|I had problems with the download of this.  And I don't know why.  The 4 songs I got off the download are great.  Wish I could hear them all.
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|Atlantis, and its predecessor, Stargate SG-1, have to be my all-favorite series.  They are well written with wonderful characters and without all the social junk that is often thrown in for social agendas.  The series after this, stargate universe was junk!  But don't compare Atlantis or SG-1 to Universe because they are like night and day.
B00AQM8H9I|3.0|Not the best game.  But fun.  Will probaly get boring after a while.  Still playing.  Good extra game to have on kindle.
1451695195|1.0|I'm a Mechanical Engineer and I've always been a non-believer. My mother and brother-in-law are in the active phases of dying so I was interested in reading this book to see if the author could convince me there is an afterlife. He failed miserably.<br /><br />I felt like I was reading the Wizard of Oz the way he described his passage to heaven. Some lady on the wings of a butterfly, etc.. it just seemed to me like he was having a wild dream.  I don't doubt that he was in a deep coma and came out of it and I'm happy for him and his family. But recalling images of when he was in the coma is not proof enough for me.<br /><br />Like other reviewers, I felt he liberally made use of excessive chapters just to fill up pages in a book rather than publishing this in a medical journal.
B00881PTRC|4.0|Like it, but the dead guy creeps me out.  Plus no activity if you win.  Why doesn't the guy jump up and down?

B00ANGICRE|5.0|To be born with (or subsequently contract) a severe physical deformity consigns one to an often lonely interior world of the mind -- life restricted as much by one's own mental struggle as the more obvious physical challenges.  And because human beings are nothing if not social beings, adjusting to the \\"normal\\" world of others is the greatest obstacle such a child/adolescent faces.  Upon achieving adulthood, the expression of one's sexuality, while central to our species as a form of communication in that social setting, very often takes a back seat to other more immediate needs.<br /><br />This film is a rare look at our world from the inside out.  The task here is not to perform or to practice, or even to initiate.  The goal is connection one person to another at the most profound and basic level.  A form of communication and intimacy which many take for granted is explored from our POV, and handled with sensitivity, humor, compassion, and empathy. I appreciated being a part of this journey, and felt connected as well, if only because many of the thoughts and emotions expressed are the very ones I too have known so well.

B00BD2DRHW|5.0|I like that it has a tutorial to show you the ropes and then turns you loose to figure out the rest on your own. I didn't know it could be so fun building bridges...makes you think
0062064304|3.0|its okay so here are the 18 more words required good, fine, interesting, well made, nice cover, good value, cool.

B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|When I went to see Oblivion I never expected that I would want to instantly get the soundtrack.  Heck, I think the last soundtrack I bought was from O Brother.  This compilation by M83 works great and is a fabulous score.  I would highly recommend whether you've seen Oblivion or not.
B007ZSBQYE|3.0|This is one of those games that has great potential. But u won't feel dirty after playing, I'm referring to how one feels when you pay a complete rip off on another game but fails to even come close. This game is completely original. But that freaking car is too sensitive.
B004JN1D2I|3.0|As a newbie to fantasy fiction, I found the first 3 books were engaging and wonderfully written, but book 4 had none of the qualities that held my interest.  It seemed to be almost a tedious effort by GRRM to continue the story he began more than 2 decades ago.  I was honestly disappointed with 4, with its long winded chapters that seemed to focus more on describing feasts, flashbacks, and fornication than the actual story.  I was so looking forward to starting A Dance with Dragons when I embarked on the maddeningly exhausting journey of reading book 4.  Now that I'm done and have read reviews of ADWD, I think I'll wait until books 6 and 7 are done; enough years should have passed by then for me to have forgotten the tragic waste of time that was book 4.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This series was really amazing to read! Go Hunger Games! &#34;May the odds be ever in you're favor&#34; my favorite quote!
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|This movie means so much to me.  I have not read the book, but am familiar with three other novels by Victor Hugo.  The best way I have to express my evaluation of Les Miserables is, \\"Epic as such.\\"<br />-Paul Wharton
B002K0WBXW|5.0|The best and funniest movie I have seen in a long time. Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds are a perfect match, and play well off each other.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Been using this great app for awhile. The Vegas style scoring is the part I enjoy the most.  Good fun.
B00000J2PH|5.0|I would recommend this old album (DVD verision) anytime.  Takes you back!<br />Perfect sound - I felt like I was listening to the actual Album.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is my favorite kind of game,lot of mini games with in not just the HO's but jig saw and combo locks and all of it. The walk thru was extremely helpful too! The creators  did a wonderful job  KUDO's to You and more like this PLEASE!!Now I will look for part 2. I can't seem to find the bonus level tho--  YET!  Thank's for the entertainment!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Good solid book. Stayed up late to finish this one. Liked the new character Mendenhall . Hope she returns in later books.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome its almost better than temple run. This is the BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!! Everyone will love this game, YOU SHOULD BUY THIS!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My kids and I laughed out loud so many times at Ralph and his little friends.  This is a great family night movie!  My kids, including my teenagers, asked to see it again!
B00BESIKWM|5.0|Better than the first attempt. Creep factor 10/10 with a lot of gore for the S. H. old school hard core.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The other horses shouldnt be so expensive though.<br />And they should let you breed them. it would be cool to breed and sale the horses an even get some other animals soo yah any ways  this game is perfect for people of any ages. i personally loved this game.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|It's a great game to play when ever your waiting for an apt., or the kids after school helps the time go fast.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is really fun!!! You can compete against your friends on Facebook. You can get coins and use them to buy other characters. Itsnalso fun trying to unlock characters. Subway Surfers always offers fun and easy challenges. Me and my friends love the game. Subway Surfers Rocks!!!!!
B00846REIS|3.0|Easy read, moves along at a fast pace. If you like the Fifty Shades trilogy chances are you'll enjoy this-they are very similar, which is a bit of a weakness for this series.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love ths game and app....it is addicting! I can't stop playing! Love it! Better than any other bingo game. Will definately recommend.
1451695195|5.0|This book was well written, very believable as it is written by the physician who experienced it.  Easy to read, easy to understand.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|This app overcomes all the shortcomings of the stock Android calendar app. I could not function without it on my phone.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Another magnificent addition to the song of fire and ice series. It leaves you waiting anxiously for the next one.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|I have read this book numerous times, and it never disappoints.  The love a mother has for a child is unconditional and never ending.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|As expected from Lee Childs, I have read all the Jack Reacher novels you will ove this one. I have enjoyed all the books in this series.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This book seems somewhat juvenile, as if written for a teen or young adult.  However, I would not want a daughter of mine to read the book... I wouldn't want her to think such an unhealthy relationship was what she should seek out.  With that said: as a grown, married woman I found the book a guilty pleasure!  It was like watching an accident... you want to turn away but cannot!!  The characters are real and rich.  Their passion for one another is what we all crave. Reminded me of some of my young loves!
B008MEM24S|5.0|My daughter (6) enjoys getting the water to Perry, while I like to follow behind and fully &#34;solve&#34; the level.
B009AMANH4|5.0|It's not just DDL's performance, but everyone around him as well. Loved this film so much, I bought the Blu-Ray.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Martin Freeman was a good choice for Bilbo. As he has in past roles (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Sherlock) he exhibits a broad range of human (hobbit?) traits that make the character likable, something not always evident in LOTR. Can't wait to see how his costar in Sherlock makes out as the Necromancer, don't guess there will be much (if any)  interaction between the two characters. They could have done a bit more with Richard Armitage's character (Thorin); some of the other dwarves were a lot more dimensional than he. All he seemed to do was glower during the whole movie, maybe it was something he ate.
B008JFUO4U|1.0|After viewing a preview for this movie I was excited to see it. Even interview with Tom Cruise created a lots of hype about it talking how amazing it was to work with filmmakers. I was very disappointed to find out that the movie is nothing else, but boring. Yes, visual effects are done well, but in 2013 it's just expected.<br />Story of this movie can be told in 5 minutes. Problem is that its stretched into 2 hours. Script of the movie steals ideas from many others sci-fi movies gluing them together in one confused story. There are also some obvious logical holes and not even Morgan Freeman appearance (for about 5 minutes total) could save this movie. Story moves very slowly without any twists. This movie is just bad.
B00AQM8H9I|4.0|My six year old loves this game, it was easy enough for him to learn and he doesn't need much help.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love subway suffers because it make my day go by. Fast and more over I play with my friends on fb that a good thing
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I love this game! The graphics are awesome! My four year old nephew and thirteen year old son love this game as well. You will be hooked once you start playing this game.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Nice graphics and game play. Tutorial is audio and text but does not explain the tools that can be purchased with in game points earned with game play. Pop up for survey delivered after a dozen levels... more than enough time to decide if $2 for the rest of the 100  levels is worth it.
B003PGL4QU|5.0|Is a great LP album, especially Dream #9. As with Beatle albums, I am never disappionted. Vintage, classic John Lennon.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|My wife and I have seen the stage play 5 times and listened to the soundtrack many, many times.  We have watched all of the Les Mis movies that we could find to rent, and enjoyed each of them, especially the recent version staring Liam Neeson.  As a result we were excited to this new version...especially after watching the YouTube clips of how the movie was produced.  We saw the movie twice in the theaters when it first came out and were blown away each time...it far surpassed our expectations.  Needless to say, we couldn't wait for it to come out on Blueray.
B009AMANBA|1.0|Not what I expected! It should have been titled &#34;THE THRITEENTH AMMENDMENT&#34;. It had very little to do with Lincoln. Definitely not what I expected! I wish I could get my money back...I also wish I could have the time back that I sat through this boring film!
B00975L81Y|1.0|I listened to the tracks of this song at FYE and i gotta say I hated it :( the songs lack anything exciting. The songs run together, theres no melodies, and the vocals aren't near as good as The previous albums. Don't get this turd! Save your money like I did.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|A fantastic concept, that although not new is masterfully woven through complex characters and plot lines. A must see for any sci-fi drama fans!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love almost all English movies...Love the way the English live. This series exciting and have some wonderful actors..Love to see how the rich lived in England in that era...don't like that Sibel died or Matthew....especially Matthew....wish they could have figured some other way to do that....but I am anxiously awaiting the fourth season...I will buy the DVD..
B00498YZH8|3.0|I watched this movie to see Jennifer Lawrence in a different setting from the Hunger Games.  There was quite a bit of similarity between her character in The Winter's Bone to Katniss in The Hunger Games.  She's the strong teenager who is taking care of her family because her mom can't.  The story line kept me intrigued to see if she triumphs in the end.  Worth watching.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Just wish sometimes people could live happily ever after..like in a fairy tale..I know this is like real life and it isn't always happily ever after...but I can wish....
B00BGIC4I6|5.0|If your married with kids at 40 or close to, you have to watch this movie, you wont regret it!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I didn't understand what all the fuss was about &#34;Angry Birds&#34;, now I do!  Fun and challenging game, and great for spare time entertainment.
B00006I53S|5.0|For those that don't want to spend the money for an L series this this is a very nice lense.  Only issue I have is there isn't a  lens lock so when carrying your camera the lense will slide out to full zoom.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|Pocahontas was one of my favorite movies as a kid and was just as enjoyable to rewatch as an adult. Def worth the buy!
1402760663|4.0|Great book ... the story that has never been put on screen by Hollywood!<br />It is good to see that today's era is producing authors brave enough to actually tell the true story.
B0089AD8IO|4.0|I'm not in love with this series like a lot of my friends are, but it is a fun watch and was worth the buy. Shipping was fast and product was in good condition. I just hope they add in some more characters or something to spice things up
B000PDYVVG|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this book.  I read it in 2 days.  I laughed (yes, out loud!), cried, envisioned her journeys and reflected on my own life.  Great journey :)
B0034JKZ86|4.0|It's not my favorite disney princess movie but it was a fun watch and worth the price. It was definately worth getting to complete my collection!
B000MQC9H4|4.0|Good chick flick movie and really good actors! Makes you feel warm and fuzzy! Loved the ending even though it was predictable! Still would recommend to see!
B00BDSRISA|4.0|French alternative band Phoenix return back onto the scene with 2013's [[ASIN:B00BDSRISA Bankrupt]] after a four year hiatus since 2009's breakout effort [[ASIN:B0021X515S Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix]].  Bankrupt! proves to be a compelling effort that is tightly constructed at just over 40 minutes in duration.  Only 10 tracks deep, Phoenix deliver no deal breakers, with the album's biggest home run being the enthusiastic promo single \\"Entertainment\\".<br /><br />\\"Entertainment\\" is the 'crowning achievement' of Bankrupt!, characterized by its recurrent oriental music riff and most notably, it's epic chorus: \\"Entertainment, show them what you do with me / when everyone here knows better / What I once refused to be / Is everything they long together / I'd rather be alone\\".  Constructed in sound form (verse, pre-chorus, chorus, bridge, etc.), \\"Entertainment\\" is the song to beat.  Follow-up, \\"The Real Thing\\" has great intentions, but falls short of the same glory and excitability exhibited by the exceptional opener.  Even so, \\"The Real Thing\\" benefits from a driving groove, and another bright, electronic influenced sound.  Like \\"Entertainment\\", the chorus shines and helps to unify the cut.<br /><br />If \\"The Real Thing\\" was a slight downgrade, \\"S.O.S. in Bel Air\\" returns Phoenix back to the top.  Uptempo, \\"S.O.S.\\" also proves to be catchier and feistier than its predecessor.  The best part? The aggressive treatment of lyrics \\"Put my name in your list / S.O.S. in Bel Air!\\" \\"Trying to Be Cool\\" keeps things going strong, opening with a mysterious flourish of electronics before settling into a stable groove.  Aside from the strong 80s influenced production, the songwriting and vibe of \\"Trying to Be Cool\\" makes it truly 'cool', epitomized by lyrics such as \\"They teach you suffer to resist / Too much intention Presbyterian / Mint julep testosterone / tell me that you want me...\\" \\"Bankrupt!\\", the title track follows, clocking in at nearly seven minutes.  While it should feel completely overwrought, Phoenix basically allow themselves plenty of breathing room for instrumental music moments.  The vocals don't enter until the four and a half minute mark, with only a small amount of lyrics ultimately.  It doesn't match the grandeur of \\"Entertainment\\", \\"S.O.S.\\" or \\"Trying to Be Cool\\", but \\"Bankrupt\\" remains a solid and ambitious track from the band and listener's perspectives.<br /><br />\\"Drakkar Noir\\" has one of the more clever titles, name-dropping the fragrance.  Still clinging onto the 80s influence, the sound remains bright as ever with frontman Thomas Mars delivering enthusiastic vocals.  \\"Chloroform\\" keeps in step, slowing the tempo  to a bit more of a medium, grinding pace.  Perhaps not a profound, but simple chorus, Mars and company keep things catchy: \\"My love, my love, my love, my love is...cruel.\\"  \\"Don't\\" contrasts \\"Chloroform\\", opting for a quicker pace and a more excited sound.  \\"I'll never know / I'll never know / restrained / reach out for me /I'll never know / Don't...\\" Mars sings on the chorus.  Keeping things unified, a recurrent synthetic riff helps to shape the cut.  Penultimate cut \\"Bourgeois\\" keeps in line with the consistency of its counterparts while the closing \\"Oblique City\\" is solid, though not necessarily a 'stand out'.<br /><br />All said and done, [[ASIN:B00BDSRISA Bankrupt]] is another fine offering from the Parisian band.  No filler to be found, every cut has some redeeming quality with some being truly remarkable.  Few quibbles or rubs makes it extremely easy to recommend Bankrupt.tely overwrought, Phoenix basically allow themselves plenty of breathing room for instrumental music moments.

B001DM1VXE|5.0|I liked the overall quality and the story line is very interesting. It makes you think throughout the movie and forces you to pay attention for certain details.
1400049628|5.0|this book is great....it is a work of fiction that just makes you think about what will happen. Lots of fun to read.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|I like how it works with the my Kindle HD.  The app makes it easy to check my facebook account on my Kindle,  instead of going to my computer or phone.
0307346617|5.0|This book was fun hands down. While reading it I couldn't put it down. It is now going to be a movie...I wonder if the movie will do the book the slightest bit of justice. From what I can see so far the movie, will not be as good as the book.
B0035JRVBO|1.0|Love this movie and was looking forward to streaming it but the video quality is poor compared to Netflix streaming. At first I thought it might be a network issue but the streaming player shows that my connection has full bars for the highest quality.  I would hate to see what lower quality looks like.
B004GCPJDQ|3.0|English:<br />This product it's very good. The charged work only between 40% and 50%. Don't charge 100%.<br />The only problem is the USB cable. it's very short.<br />Good bye batteries...Mobee resolve my problem.<br /><br />Portuguese:<br />Este produto é muito bom.

B00CDSVZHY|4.0|i asked for the HD version of the movie and it was nothing even anything like HD.<br />Thats the only thing i have to complain about.<br />The movie itself was great.
B00942X8PY|5.0|This is somewhat like the PathPix games. It will have tricks to do so you can complete the puzzle. One must be logical to complete the harder puzzles.
B0095ZMMCK|1.0|This is another bad attempt to continue the \\"Ryan Series\\" with a sub-par coauthor. The story has gone from plausible political and military thriller to unbelievable \\"James Bond/Jason Borne.\\" I will not read another Clancy novel again.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Lets face it, youtube sucks for watching videos on your phone. Most the time you find your self waiting for it to buffer, and tube mate will download the video faster then it take s it to buffer. So until youtube wakes up, get this app to make youtube viewing better.
B009GXHOW4|3.0|I wish zhuowei zhang would have given a more in depth description of the app didn't realize I had to waste 7 dollars just for it to work&gt;:(
B00914JWSW|5.0|once again a first class cd.  Barbra is my idol her singing voice is just perfection and once again<br />brought a fantastic choice of songs on her CD
B008QLXSG8|5.0|The book is engaging, although depressing.  The &#34;hero&#34; is a man who has failed to form attached relationships, and Camus shows how important they are by their absence.  The style is an interesting combination of the Mersault being the subject and the narrator.  I hope you will realize that the reason he committed the murder is not &#34;the sun&#34; as most French school children reply when asked.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Fanatastic dilivery service - keep up the good work<br /><br />THE DVD IS ALSO FANTASTIC ENJOYED IT AGAIN A I SAY IT IN THE CINEMA STUNNING EFFECTS
B0051YDTKS|2.0|We were gifted with the finest guitarist to come along in decades only to lose Randy Rhodes nearly as quick as he was found.  This edition does not pay the tribute to him he deserves.  No one had the right to diminish this epic guitar playing but it has been done.
B002FQOI0A|4.0|This is one of the best books ever!!!!! It was kind of confusing at the end. But it's a great book!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|This was a well written historical novel.  There was a little too much &#34;battle&#34; description.  It was a compelling storyline.
B005C4ERHQ|2.0|My manager wanted everyone to take it.  the book is an easy and quick read.  The test is long and makes no sense.  This is no going to find your strength.  You are better off taking whats called an AVA.
B00A77II0U|4.0|Fun game that took a while to complete. Wasn't' t crazy about the way the hidden items were listed. Other than that an enjoyable and somewhat challenging game.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I absolutely loved the Lincoln DVD.  It was everything I had expected.  Will watch it again and again.  Daniel Day-Lewis does an excellent job.  He portrays Lincoln just as I imagined Lincoln to be.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|As always, Ms Reichs gets to the heart of her stories immediately. Temperance Brennan is a very<br />skilled professional, and I am always interested in the way the main plot challenges her intellect and<br />personal life . This story was particularly engrossing, using a subject not at all comfortable for most.<br />Done with care, and well-thought out. Kept my attention throughout, and I would recommend it to<br />all who require smart, absorbing and illuminating reads.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I have worked alot of Magic Puzzles.  But since getting this new app it constantly stops at any given time and what ever puzzle I am working on at the time will be lost.  And I work the 288 piece count.  Like I stated fun app but I hope they fix the bugs and then give the updated one to the customer automatically.
0978545095|5.0|In contrast to Maloof's book, this volumn brings a bit of sadness with it.  The photographs are impressive and well reproduced but the narrative of Ms. Maier's life can't help but make one wistful about what quirks of personality and experience caused her to live the way she did, inside herself, hiding her life and photographs away from the world.  With complementary material and focus, I view this book as an excellent companion and in some ways counterpoint to the book by Maloof, which I also have.  Maloof's does definitely give a more cheerful aftertaste, though.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|This story has plenty of feeling and multiple meanings.  Its a good philosophical thinking movie.  You will have something to think about and talk about with friends and family afterwards.
1576875776|5.0|but then life at its best is a surprise.  Mr. Maloof has done the world a service by recognizing and promoting the photography of this quintessentially quirky photographer.  The photographs in this volumn do an excellent job of demonstrating Ms. Maier's talent and the text introduces to her unique personality without condescension or carnival.
0811826848|5.0|For a Beatles fan couldn't ask for more definitely a must have probably most fans have all this knowledge already but great to have it all presented in one volume
B006LSZECO|4.0|A very interesting book-i enjoyed it thoroughly. I would definitely refer it to my friends,and would like to read anything else that this author writes.
B00650SSDU|5.0|I love this movie, Justin Timberlake is one of my favorites and he is hilarious in this movie. Mila and Justin have great chemistry and the whole things is just funny from start to finish. Plus there is a great supporting cast as well.
B003VANOFY|5.0|great headset see it until now .<br /><br />you can change you sound in one  click.<br />no heat in ears .<br />good for game and movies  . .
B005LBF7CY|5.0|A good story showing the life of the people in a hotel and how much work it is to run a hotel,
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This was a very heartfelt movie.  The graphics was outstanding.  The story line was on point, and touch the heart.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I originally bought this app for my sister, but I find myself playing it more often. This is a very entertaining app that is great for anyone. :)
B00APDABX8|5.0|Gone Again is another top read from one of my favourite writers, Doug Johnstone. There's no larking about in this tale of one man's battle to discover why his wife has vanished but the raw emotion that Johnstone manages to capture is heartfelt and although I found it difficult to read at times, the honesty that comes over makes this such a worthwhile read. I was terrified not about what had happened to the wife but what was possibly going to happen to the father as his life got out of control. It's difficult to write realistic dialogue with a child but Johnstone pulls this off very well, and shows a good understanding of what makes children tick and how their little minds flash about from one emotion to another.<br /><br />A great story of human emotions mixed up with a few gangsters and howling weather on the east coast of Scotland. One not to miss and I can't wait to find out what Johnstone comes up with next - a very classy writer.
B005GSY23M|5.0|Had all the music I remember from the movie, which I loved-- great price for the quality and quantity. Also great driving music. A must for any fan of the film.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a fun app on my new kindle.  Breaks it down to show me how much time I have left depending on what activity I am doing.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This is the most useful app I have one the Kindle! Gives you TOTAL information on the wi-fi you are using as well as everyone else around you. You can see what channels are jammed up and what is free. Just get it, use it and make life easier! 2 thumbs up on this one!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Brilliant!!!! I cannot overstate how good this practically free book is. Constant tension and a really likable protagonist. Get it now!
B007STBUIW|5.0|Not much more to say here than what probably has already been said. You either like this movie or you don't pretty much
B009MYARIK|3.0|Anyone who knows me, knows I'm a HUGE Sophia Kinsella fan. Every book is an adventure for me. Lottie and Fliss are just two more characters that I will add to my favorites. Lottie has that Rebecca airiness to her while I feel Fliss' character reminded me of the character from the Undomestic Goddess.
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|I watched this at the time of release in theater, and this Blu-ray is exactly like what I experienced.  You get the experience of the theater at home, without the crowd.  A very good quality.
B00B2064IY|4.0|Jimi may be gone but his music keeps on rockin'. Liked most of the tracks but a few were a little tedious on the solos. Two tracks were full blown r n' b complete with sax and organ. Don't know who did the vocals but they were great as were the arrangements which were classic.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|I watched this movie during the release in theaters, and this Blu-ray matches the quality and sound that I experienced.  If you have the right TV and Blu-ray player, you won't be disappointed with this purchase.

B00BM1AJIO|1.0|I bought this game for 4.99. Won't download on my Kindle! Usually try free first but went ahead and purchased because of glowing reviews. Keeps saying network not available yet I have no problem with any other games! What a waste of money!
B005LAII4E|1.0|This movie was crap it had some good action and i knew they going to f it up when they ended it the way they did but you kill Destro that should have been black in the first one but to kill him off that fast unreal and then you had Zartan like 80 years old in his movie with him being storm shadow step dad are you kidding me this has to be the poorest put together movie i have ever saw just use big name and that going to sell your sad real sad way to kill some off that could have been as big as transformer but just like that 80's Prime wins again and don't get me started on that film

B00BESFWBY|4.0|Ending caught me by surprise because I know nothing about the surfing community in Santa Cruz, Ca! I recommend this movie to my friends and family!
B00BHU9DUK|2.0|Compared to the other movies I have seen, this is a freakish modernized version.  I don't recommend it, but if one is curious go for it.
B008N1V11U|4.0|if i get this game i will play it everyday and ill be the best in it i like it
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The book is fantastic! It is well written and every moment has purpose. The imagery makes you feel as if you are walking down Himmel Street.
0439023513|5.0|Ms. Collins, I fell in love with Katniss without realizing it.  I cared, I worried, I laughed and I cried. And, please know, I truly love your story.  However, even as I was ever enchanted with Katniss throughout The Hunger Games, and then rooted for her in Catching Fire, I felt something missing.  Then, into Mockingjay, I realized what it was.  All through the series even though it pained her deeply, i.e. losing Rue, and then Prim, she seemed, certainly through her strength of character, to accept that death, however painful, was just part of life.  I was truly happy for them when Katniss and Peeta finally got together.  Then I realized what I believe is missing.  And, yes, even as you stated in the New York Times \\"It's crucial that young readers are considering scenarios about humanity's future because the challenges are about to land in their laps,\\" wouldn't it be fair to at least \\"hint\\" that there might be an alternative, i.e. the truth of the Bible?  For after their romantic joy, marriage, kids,and eventual death, what then?  Emptiness, darkness, nothingness?  And, I hurt for them. For where was God?  Today's kids wonder about \\"this\\" too.  God was simply not there for them, as you chose not to include Him.<br /><br />Real or not real?<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Frank Sladko
B006S009IY|5.0|I've watched this movie several times now and it still holds it's enchantment over me and the family every time.
B000P0J09C|3.0|It's one of those movies you have to see to keep up with your buddies quoting it, and the various references to it in pop culture.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Helen Hunt is amazing as well as all the actors in this touching movie. Full of humor and insight. Watch this movie.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|My husband and I were absolutely cracking up at this movie.  Wasn't over the top cheesy and we both really enjoyed it.
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|Slow paced but this movie has a great cast of characters. If you're not expecting a happy ending then this ones for you.
B000641D2Y|5.0|Absolutely love this movie! Funniest one out of all of them. And it is a good Christmas movie. Watch it every year.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Can't wait for season 4!  The season 3 continues the rapid-pace format of its predecessors with engaging story lines.  There are many subtle points that I needed a second viewing to pick up.
0887307280|5.0|As a prospective small business owner, I wanted to get my hands on a compact but unique perspective on small business operations.  This book provided a great &#34;alternate perspective,&#34; but also sparked many further thoughts and provoked important conversations with my co-founder.  Definitely worth the read, from a green new-business owner.
1609611543|4.0|HI, I need no gluten (wheat/barley/rye...oats may hurt even if they say gluten free). I need no dairy/soy/sugar. Corn maybe genetically modified may hurt people. Eating this way stopped my MS and other health issues of the brain/body. This is the Celiac diet. Tests may not work to diagnose Celiac and doctors may not be trained in it. It is not just wheat. I take vitamins/good oils and LDN which helps to block gluten contamination. Nuts not in the shell and luncheon meat may have gluten contamination. Any gluten destroys my gut lining now...even microscopic amounts. I am glad this book is getting people to know about Celiac...and I hope the people figure out the rest to be healthy.
0425263908|1.0|This book took me nowhere. It was a poor rip-off of 50 Shades of Gray, but I must say it was very well written. When I finished the book I had to ask myself \\"What the hell happened?\\" Nothing was solved... Gideon's secret is still a secret. Cary has an orgy (Don't understand why that was important) and all these new characters came in at the end of the book with no explanation. Honestly, only read this if its free! Don't waste your money like I did!!
0143038419|5.0|The book is inspirational. It has become my Bible. I have read it so many times and learn something new each time. To say it has been life changing is an understatement. It inspired me to begin a journey of self knowledge and a path I found I have been looking for for years. Elizabeth Gilbert is funny, wise and brave. I will always be indebted to her for putting into words the thoughts in my own head. Her book gave me the encouragement to take a leap of faith and start my own journey.
B008Y7IP0S|5.0|I remember seeing it a long time ago with my kids and It is still as good and as it was then!
B005G4TJI4|5.0|I'm not sure if the series was intended as a trilogy or not, but I do believe that it should be and just leave well enough alone.  I know they can always find a new way to kill Optimus Prime and then bring him back, but hey, why?
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I can't seem to get enough of this game. I have my grandchildren playing it also. It keeps them entertained.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is amazing! I often. forget what verse I'm looking at so later I can never find it. But with this app I can type part of the in and it finds it for me! This app IS amazing.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This is a game I play before bedtime - two or three different games and I'm read for some zzzzz's.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love this book. Great story line and each character is amazing. You feel the pain and emotions, great reading material for all ages
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Could not put this book down. Began second book as soon as I finished the first. Absolute must read for women of all ages. I fell in love with the love that grew between Christian and Anna.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I choose my rating because you can read it over and over again and not really get boring to me
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I like the game but I feel like it needs more sand dollars at the beginning and be able to go to more friends to collect.
B00992CF6W|5.0|. Minecraft is the bomb. I can`t stop playing minecraft. I play it like 27/7 I am addicted to minecraft all day.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This is the kind of game Ive been looking for!  Good controls great graphics and a very rich experience overall.  If you have trouble installing just delete some other apps...its big and needs a lot of room to play.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Perplexus Epic is a mind blowing challenge. I love it. It has stumped me for all of these days I have had it. I even get frustrated at the actual globe. I would certainly recommend this item.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I try to read all of Kathy Reichs' novels. Don't always get to do that but I try hard. Her work is an inspiration for my own writing. Succinct but not terse. Interesting and often fascinating. Keeps me turning pages into the wee hours--when I get a chance to do that.<br /><br />I recommend you read her entire body of work, keeping up with new titles as best you can, and keep the books to read again.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|It's a touching book, you learn about the second World Ward and the sad history about the Hipodrome  D'Hiver in Paris.<br />It's about a recent history we must not  forget.<br />For those who likes history.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I'll admit, I was as skeptical as the rest when Daniel Craig was announced as the next James Bond. He proved himself in Casino Royale, while the writing of Quantum of Solace let Bond fans down all over the world. With 2012 being the 50th anniversary of the James Bond movie franchise, Skyfall had to be big... and it was!<br /><br />In Skyfall, the story ties together everything since the series reboot in Casino Royale and could easily be followed by Dr. No. Skyfall puts everything into place to set up for the Bond we all know and love, while making many witty references to Bond movies of old that a true fan will appreciate. References to the ejector seat from Goldfinger, exploding pens from Goldeneye, and who can forget the return of the DB5?<br /><br />The movie was good enough to see twice on opening night, and was more than good enough to preorder on the Blu-Ray/DVD + Digital Copy. The Digital Copy allowed me to download through iTunes, and because of this the movie is a staple on my iPad Mini, so I can watch the movie any time I want on a flight across the country. The DVD/Blu-Ray live next to the DVD player in my living room for those nights a guy just needs to watch a good espionage movie.<br /><br />This movie is a must-own in my book and I would rate higher if I could.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|You can't stop reading. You get aattached  to all the caracters,  their  lifes and strugles.<br />For those who wants to learn about the second World War.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I really like it! it doesn't work as well with the Kindle Fire (original) as the Letters from Nowhere game. you cant enlarge the screen very well so the small objects are more difficult to see.
B00CE6E6B2|5.0|I love this app it's so fun and easy but that only thing I don't like Is that there's not much to do but it's still addicting.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|I had to read this book for school and I don't really like to read when I have to.  This book was so good, I told my mom about it because she loves to read and now she is reading it and she loves it.  We are also buying it for my grandfather for Father's Day!
B009KEN87O|5.0|If you remember the original Space Invaders, this is the app for you. Lots of variety in waves but look out for the invisible tunnel every 13th level.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|To my sister in law thy recommended this book. I loves it.  A total page turner. Have t enjoyed a book so much in a while.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|My wife had to go to Colorado to help take care of her mother.  She borrowed my kindle fire and put in a lot of apps.<br />I know that she shows and sells on e-bay so it is extremely important to have this ability with the kindle.  Since she got the app I am sure that she is putting it to good use.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|I can't stop playing this CD - each and every song is fabulous - especially Doin' What She Likes, Mine Would Be You & Grandaddy's Gun!!!
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I can't believe I waited this long to get into this show.  Once I started, I can't stop watching.  Different from all of the usual law type shows.
0425252868|5.0|This story lives up to it title.  An incredible act of chivalry by one man in the throes of war.  This book was also a historical look at post World War II Germany as well as the German Air Force during the war.  A very uplifting readl
B005UWGRIC|5.0|The Progress Live DVD is a must have. it started off as 4 members with a couple of songs then they introduce their big surprise to the fans and I love how they did it. And it was the 5th member Robbie Williams and he done a couple of his solo songs and then the second half was just amazing because all 5 members of Take That Gary Barlow, Robbie Williams, Jason Orange, Mark Owens and Howad Donald perform all together it was just an amazing time. The fans went wild and so did I. It was just a Take That and Party good time.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|I rated this one 4 out of 5 stars because the extras aren't as great as I hoped they'd be. But still... yeah gotta love the Thrones!
1574216988|4.0|author provided step by step instructions plus some good illustrations.  book smaller than I would have thought it would be.
B009CF7GRY|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie, story lines, dancing and acting wasn't bad either. lot of movement within to hold ones interest.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This is a great inspiring story!  I did get lost in the medical lingo, though.  I had difficulty getting through some parts of the book.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I was expecting more, not sure why the director chose to end the movie, like he did ( maybe there is more to come.) overall I liked it, story line um, I didn't really get why the were using low income people as bate. The missing element didn't come across within the story for this movie.
B00BF11STU|1.0|Was so much pain and gore necessary? I know a point was to be made, but it looks like nothing has changed anyway.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|So here's the skinny on this watch.  It is an absolute steal at $66 (cost at the time I purchased it on Amazon, which is far below MSRP).  It has Seiko's workhorse 7s26 movement that is accurate to within 10 seconds a day.  Excellent for a mechanical watch in this price range.  The watch has Seiko's \\"Diaflex\\" unbreakable mainspring, \\"Diashock\\" technology (shock resistance), a very good autowind mechanism, both a day and a date complication, and is water resistant. (These are the \\"5\\" features in Seiko \\"5\\"). There is a lot of technology in this movement though not in the same league as an expensive chronograph. It is highly regarded by watch enthusiasts as an excellent value movement that is surprisingly accurate and durable. Those more knowledgeable than me regarding watch movements think this watch can last 10 years plus without servicing.  I love watches, feel n'ked without one, but I'm not so keen on quartz movements.  I must have some mechanical fetish because I simply love mechanical watches - always have.  However, fine automatic and mechanical watches run into real money very quickly -- much more than I'm willing to spend on any watch as much as I enjoy them.  I consider myself fortunate that Seiko still makes a high quality and stylish automatic watch in this price range for everyday wear.<br /><br />As for the styling -- beautifully understated yet unique and smart. This watch \\"works\\" with jeans, beachwear, casual \\"out\\" and casual \\"business\\" attire but this is not a dress watch. Just don't wear it with a suit.<br /><br /> This Seiko will be on my wrist until either it dies or I do, which ever comes first.  And if it goes before me?  I hope Seiko still has a fine automatic offering in this price range as a successor a decade or two from now (I'm hoping).  Well worth every penny (and then some). Thank you Seiko!
B00BHMETKC|1.0|Very boring...took forever to get on the &#34;road&#34;..why cant US producers, directors, playrights, take after the European films, especially Swedish...look at the difference between The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, seemingly hours of chases and &#34;excitement&#34; rather than just telling the story..too much time making the &#34;star&#34; look  good rather than the story itself. The Pianist was, however, a good US movie. ARGO? bleech....did we really wear out hair like that?
B000OT8GCQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, but I almost feel that the ending could have been better.<br />I wish the author would have included mire details about the future rather than just having such a bland and puzzling ending.
B00006J9OV|5.0|After seeing the Met's Parsifal during this Met season - and as that is not available on DVD yet - I decided to get the older one from the Met.<br />Although Siegfried Jerusalem is no Jonas Kaufmann, he held up extremely well and Kurt Moll and Bernd Weikl can take it up with the best Gurnemanzes and Amfortases. As for Waltraud Meier she is simply extraordinary - both in looks, acting and singing. To me, she alone would be worth the price of admission.<br />I also much preferred the production of this Parsifal - the new Met's one is from hunger.<br />This having been said, I'll still get the DVD of the new Met Parsifal. However, I'll always treasure this extraordinary older one.
B003B02O14|5.0|This is John Grisham at his best. A different take on the partnership of lawyers. What a wonderful imagination this guy has. You won't want to put it down. Leaves you wanting more. Written in the late 90's but I discovered it only recently.  Can't believe I missed this one while reading his other books.  Hope the next one is not too far off..
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I don't want to give anything away.  I enjoyed the book.  It was very good.  Kept my interest well.  It makes me want to learn more about people who amnesia.
1451668945|5.0|In \\"Daddy's Gone A Hunting\\" by Marry Higgins Clark, Kate Connelly nearly dies in the explosion of her father's furniture antique reproduction company, when she goes there in the middle of the night to meet up with Gus Schmidt, her friend and a laid off craftsmen who gets killed as a result of the explosion. As Kate falls into a coma, it is up to her sister Hannah, a fashion designer, to try to piece everything together while their father Doug Connelly, a drunk womanizer who hasn't been managing the furniture company left to him by his father for five years now, delegating the job to plant manager Jack Worth, is acting very strange. As is Jack himself, who tries to explain away the absence of working security cameras at the site, as Doug not wanting to spend extra money on the already failing business. Of course the explosion at the plant means a five million dollar pay out--if Doug can prove the explosion was not set on purpose.<br /><br />As the explosion is being investigated, further mysterious ordeals are tied into the main plot line: the mysterious disappearances of two young women: Tracey Sloane, who disappeared twenty eight years ago while working as a waitress in new York, and Jamie Gordon who disappeared two years ago while working on a project interviewing the homeless. Somehow their disappearances are tied in to the explosion at the furniture plant, though it's unclear how.<br /><br />Meanwhile the widow of Gus Schmidt who was killed by the explosion, Lottie Schmidt, is obviously hiding something. Her daughter Gretchen is living in a million dollar house, and it's unclear where the money has come from. But she is not the only one hiding something. Add to the list Clyde Hotchkiss: a Vietnam vet and homeless person who was one of the last people to see Jamie Gordon, before she disappeared.<br /><br />Overall impressions: I enjoyed the complex plot woven by Clark, with all of the characters and their conflicting agendas. The mystery is not who is the villain(at least for me), as it is pretty apparent throughout the book with Clark's drawn out characterizations, but rather the how. How is everything connected? That's what kept me turning the pages. And like a jigsaw puzzle, the pieces all come together at the end.
B003TH2LYY|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Castle T.V series, and the seasons only get better and better. If you enjoy a single episode, you will enjoy the whole series.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I used this with Win7 and an old cub scout pinewood derby race track timer.  I worked perfectly.  Was truly plug and play.
B003THJA1G|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Castle T.V series, and the seasons only get better and better. If you enjoy a single episode, you will enjoy the whole series.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I am a person that is always late to great shows so I find myself always playing catch up when someone recommends a show.  Also, I am a person that like to watch a season back-to-to back, because when i am into something, I am invested wholeheartedly.  The TV series Sons of Anarchy never appealed to me.  I am not an FX network viewer so I barely knew about it.  I was automatically put off by the premise.. motor cycle club, outlaws, rednecks etc... Boy was I wrong!!!  This show is so well acted and more importantly well written that I was in from the first 10 minutes.  It also helps that the lead actor Charlie Durham is so sexy!  Katey Sagal has proven that she is not Al Bundy's wife from &#34;Married with Children&#34;.  She is tough, loves her family and does whatever it takes to protect them.. This was evident in the first episode where she offered a recovering drug addict ex-daughter in law a needle full of drugs after she gave birth.. the temptation was too great and drama ensues..  The one complaint I do have is that it is EXTREMELY violent.  There is blood, shooting, brain splatters and violent sex everywhere, so be forewarned.  There were occasions where I had to fast forward or turn my head.  It is R-rated and on network TV so there is a lot of foul and racist language, but I am not offended because its real.  It gives you a real picture of the mentality of white, black and Mexican thinks of others.  IT brings enlightenment as you realize that we still have a long way to go.  I cannot say enough for Ron Perlman,  as the President of the club and the supporting cast.  I was so impressed by the whole lot that I looked them up on IMDB to see their work.  You will not regret it and will relish in all 5 seasons.  I finished the first season in 3 days and am now on the 5th season and regret going through it so fast as Season 6 will air in Fall 2013.
B005IQ39AY|2.0|instructions weren't very clear to me.  thought this was more on the level of Jewels.  glad it didn't cost a lot of money
B002KGEORM|5.0|They out do themeselves with Season 2.  Brilliant writing and so many dynamics and a killer season finale that really gets your blood going.  Suspenseful and heartbreaking at the same time.  A lot of violent acts that I had to turn away, too real, but well acted by Katey Sagal.  I have now become a real Charlie Durham fan who is a Brit with a killer American accent.  This is his series to shine, big star for sure.  Another great aspect is the soundtrack for the series.  Katey Sagal sings on a couple of tracks but its a mixture of folk, country, hip-hop, and Mexican.  Love it so much that I got the soundtrack..
B009X01D9U|5.0|I really like all of the possibilities that this case provides- it is a bit heavier then my last one but i like the book handle and ability to rotate the screen
0061785652|5.0|James Rollins novels are well written and full of suspense.  Once I start reading I don't want to quit.  Highly recommend.
0802473156|5.0|Very insightful book to read if anybody doesn't really get why they just can hit base with there spouse maybe even a friend this is definitely worth a read. It helped me out a lot and put a different perspective on how I viewed love and how we communicate with it.
B005LAII62|5.0|This is an awesome product.  I enjoyed watching this movie.  Ths is the type of movie that I can watch over and over.
B002ZG975Q|4.0|This portal of beauty and the beast. It takes it to a whole other area. But very well but together.

158270208X|3.0|I pushed look inside I figured it was a sample but that's all, the rest are blank pages for u to write in I would rather purchase a notepad at walmart, in addition the picture says gracias on the front of the sample book online I was biting my fingernails all weekend hoping it wasn't Spanish lol it was English thank god. basically to save u some money look inside then buy your own notepad
6305433909|5.0|Great feel god movie.  I would watch this movie over and over again.  One of the best sequels ever.  Funy Funny and funny.
B000301YY8|3.0|there are two songs that are realy good the rest is kind of slow its A-Okay worth the money spent
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I really enjoy these ensemble cast shows. The first season was great but more spooky and haunted. This 2nd season took a creepy asylum theme and really ran with it. Jessica Lange is exceptional. I don't want to ruin anything but this season has a nasty serial killer, a former Nazi Dr., alien abduction, nuns, the criminally insane, the falsely imprisoned. Less ghostly and more ghastly than the first season....
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I have many of his CDs and order more in the future.....He only gets better with each new recording.  I am a music lover of all sorts of music.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|Great book doesn't really describe this dairy from a girl growing up during one of the most terrible times for life of Jewish decent. Being always fascinated with world war 2 I decided I would read this to get an idea how life was like for people like Anne. I knew it was horrible in the camps but but know how bad it was for the ones in hiding. I also watch the movie which prompted me to read the book. It's sad that anyone would have to go through that and that there is that kind of hate in the world. I don't know for as young as she was to keep an attitude that she did though out the hole ordeal or the others. Brave people they were, especially the people that gave them a place to hide. I salute you and your family Anne Frank! Cheers!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Was looking for long term forecast..this app is perfect for that and so much more information. Also usefully for moonrise and moonset times.

B004J1DBJI|5.0|I wish I could use this at college instead of a $250 TI calculator. The app understands a wealth of mathematical concepts. It's easy to enter any problem and it includes a custom keyboard of math symbols. I'm currently learning calculus at home and this app is a great help.
B00BLGZDYA|3.0|Not real sure where this was supposed to go.  The ending was awful.  It did have some interesting twists but for the most part a real stinker.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|If you like the series you will like this season. I have all seasons and like them all. Worth the price.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Definite improvement over the first. Runs great on my Kindle Fire HD 7&quot;. Good job, Glu Games! Keep it up!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Because I travel a lot some hotel (the cheap ones) don't have alarm clocks in the room or wake up calls available this app on my kindle is perfect.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|amazing story.  Don't miss it. Starts slow but definitely worth it. Great music and great story. I'd recommend to everyone.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I travel a lot out and around the country.  I have favorite radio stations that I like to listen to.  This app helps a great deal especially overseas when you can't get a southern soul radio station.
B00ADQCBEY|2.0|I was really surprised at this show - not knowing what to think, I think I missed the whole purpose of this show.  A little too violent for my tastes.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|I've never forgotten how difficult and rewarding Sonic CD was/is (yes I played it on the original Sega Genesis CD attachment).  The Kindle HD version is near perfection.  The \\"future\\" and \\"past\\" levels always made it more challenging to get thru the levels and this is true in this version too.  There are some minor issues with having the controls on the screen and respose time, but nonetheless, this is a classic side scroller at its best.  Now, can somebody bring back Vectorman!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I became practically addicted to this CD after I got it.  I am very happy with the whole album and didn't get tired of it, just don't listen to  it as much anymore for fear that my passengers will not appreciate it as often however.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|If you want to keep your computer running &#34;cool&#34; get this! It is awesome in my opinion, the best fan cooler that I have ever used in the last 20 years. My Intel i5-2500 CPU 3.3GHZ Socket LGA1155 was sending my ASUS monitoring AI Suite II alarm constantly going off when playing FlightSim 2002 or FSX and even FlightGear<br />at 74Celius to 76 Celsius. Once I installed Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus and figured out how to secure it down and I put a piece of a 2 gallon water jug between the ASUS P8P67-M motherboard and the Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus because I would feel a small electric shock when touching the case. The CPU temp is now 35Celius with a High of 42celius Motherboard holds at 32 Celsius with the only high at 38 Celsius while running FSX with everything scenery and fx planes boats and surface vehicles maxed out. I am running 2 fans the one that came with the cooler and a 120 I had in the case, as a push pull,<br /><br />I recommend this Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus 5 stars.

B003G4W49C|5.0|I really enjoyed this.  The psychological aspect of this story was very interesting and the premise overall was pretty cool. Very good book.
B001DF68MA|3.0|I hate to be the Amazon reviewer that only writes product reviews that I'm disappointed in. But I really feel I should alert the next buyer to the freakishly small size of this child seat. (I've uploaded pictures with measurements) I hate to out my baby's large back side but, I purchased this in anticipation of her 1 year birthday (baby is 9 month now). My baby's seated bottom is 8&#34;. The back support of this seat measures 4&#34; and broadens to 7&#34;. It is extremely small and I'm disappointed because it seems to  be a quality product... Just one we'll never be able to use, because it is too small.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|I love this movie and for some reason hadn't added it to my collection yet.  Can't complain about the price for a solid movie.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|Good summer music, and even better gym music. The songs are fast, catchy, and just quirky enough to let you know they're fall out boy.
B00004XQ8E|5.0|I wanted to listen to JonasKaufmann and Sofi vo Otter but they havn't playd this on disc.<br />I have enjoyed old disc with Kathleen Ferrier and I wasn't disapointed to listen to this.The wordI read<br />when listening and it is so moving- almost totears
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I'd seen Lindsey doing youtube videos, but a recommendation for &#34;dub-step violin&#34; off Uproxx was enough to convince me to buy. If this music is on in the background of your life, everything you're doing turns epic.

1601251556|5.0|My local store only ever carries the (lame) double-patterned boards. You know the ones- docks on one side, dungeon on the other or some such. For the last 10 years or so, I've had one of these that was docks on one side/blank on the other. The thing lasted past TWO vinyl mats.<br /><br />These are simply great; I've got a brand new one in reserve for that time in like 2025 when both sides of this current one are used up.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I find myself randomly playing this game. It's fairly addictive but loads of mindless fun, I can't stop playing it.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|I heard &#34;It's time&#34; on the radio a few months ago and knew it would be big. It's the sort of song that will show up in movie trailers and mash ups for the next 2 years (though, &#34;Radioactive&#34; is more catchy).<br /><br />Good stuff.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Enjoyed seeing the inside of Steve Jobs.  Very good book that lets you see the inside of Apple and understand how it was created.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|Just a complete sucky rip off of minecraft. Just pay to use the real minecraft. It is so worth it
B00CHIMG6Y|1.0|It makes no sense to rent a movie from Amazon, and end up watching it in parts due to lost connection.

B005FLX2WC|5.0|December 26, 2012 I was so excited to see The Kennedy Center Honors to watch Led Zeppelin, my favorite band in the world be honored! Before getting to them, they honored Buddy Guy. All of a sudden I saw this unfamiliar woman walk out on stage and heard this sublime voice begin to sing \\"I'd Rather Go Blind.\\" I was blown away by this woman's voice! I never heard of Beth Hart before. Who was this woman, where was she from, why have I never heard of her before and what was her musical history? After the show, I spent the next 3 hours looking at youtube videos of performances and interviews of her. Besides her amazing voice, she was so interesting to me. I purchased all her albums that night! This album is so amazing! Beth Hart was born to sing and share her talent with the world. I am so thankful I found her voice to enjoy!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved this series. I have no idead where Suzanne Collins got the idea, but, keep up the AMAZING work. Katniss Everdeen is everything I want to be, strong and courageous, yet, at the same time, kind and caring, she considers everything who has ever helped her, her family. My other favourite character is Finnick Odair! He is just too amazing, incredible for words! I always say, the others can have Peeta and Gale but I'm all for FINNICK!!!!!'&#60;3 x)

B0034G4OYK|4.0|I am an avid Disney fan, but an all-around kid at heart. This movie was so cute with a great story, and a definite different scene for Adam Sandler! I still hold Disney in a higher bracket of animation, but this was also great. I would recommend this for anyone, not just kids! Us twenty-somethings really enjoyed it in theaters and at home on the weekend. A great choice for a light-hearted, family film.

1878424319|4.0|I was skeptical that this little book could reach me, but continue to feel pleasantly surprised.  Based on some age old truths, the book enumerates four fundamental strategies that the author wants the reader to &#34;agree&#34; to abide by.  Truth be known, much of what was written could have been said in fewer words. But if you're okay with some repetition, a questionable writing style, and are patient enough to try to understand the author's rationale, you may find yourself thinking (if not acting) on the four &#34;agreements.&#34;  I did and have enjoyed the feelings of satisfaction they have produced.
0385349947|5.0|\\"Lean In\\" by Sheryl Sandberg is like reading a graduation speech. It hits all the right notes, points to significant challenges, and has the force of historical context, the speaker's extensive working experience, and a mother lode of statistics behind it. Every section ends with the positive, and it's all couched in highly accessible language. It's also directed to a specific group of women who want to be leaders in their field, that is to say, highly educated (probably white) professional women in the West.<br /><br />So why five stars? Because so many of her chapters spelled out so much of what I've thought and feared and wanted over the years. For the example, the imposter syndrome that plagued me throughout my doctoral program, where I was the only woman in my class and the youngest candidate, absolutely sure I wasn't qualified to be there, and any second now, someone would see through my precarious facade and crush it. Research shows that while everyone is susceptible to this feeling of fraudulence, women tend to experience it more intensely and be more limited by it.<br /><br />\\"Lean In\\" is peppered with these kinds of statistics, bolstered with lots of interesting personal anecdotes. Another of her examples talked about a male speaker who brushed off every female questioner but answered all the males. Afterwards, a man had taken Ms. Sandberg aside saying he had noticed this egregiousness because as a Hispanic, he had faced similar discriminations. It reminded me of a Asian American friend of mine who had identified with the women's movement because he had experienced white male privilege from the wrong end of the stick.<br /><br />More than statistic and anecdote, \\"Lean In\\" is a call for change, repeatedly (and tragically) showing how gender bias is culturally and institutionally and historically entrenched, and why everyone should stand up and ask for better. Thankfully, there's finally research that shows that diversity of staff and leadership leads to better motivation and satisfaction for everyone, and thus better bottom lines.<br /><br />There's a whole chapter about making your partner a real partner - which outlines the dismal state of childcare/domestic chore sharing in America. I'm not sure whether her optimism about the kind, capable, sharing male partners out there is warranted, but I suppose you won't get to that world without a good attitude. And when it comes to raising families and facing the choice of quitting or continuing work, Ms. Sandberg encourages women to think of their future income potential, rather than their present wages (again something only people with a certain kind of career can consider).<br /><br />There's also an interesting chapter about how women start scaling down their ambitions in the face of upcoming family plans, to the detriment of the probability of returning to work. Since it's already such a struggle to go back to a languishing career (the statistics here are abysmal as well), having a challenging and positive job situation to return to perhaps is the most critical task to work on while you're still at it.<br /><br />I'm also really glad she spoke up for feminism and being a feminist, especially after the Yahoo CEO Melissa Mayers decried any such identification. And while there were a lot of places where Ms. Sandberg's summations were too general and her points talking points, I think the only place where I really took issue with \\"Lean In\\" was where she spoke of the \\"chilling\\" effect of sexual harrassment/discrimination laws on conversation and debate and change. I think this points to her privileged situation where discrimination keeps one from getting ahead rather than getting in in the first place. I think those laws are essential, and designed for the kind of gender biases that are much more basic than the white collar white male professional old boys club discrimination that Ms. Sandberg is talking about. Not that the latter is any less difficult to strike down, nor perhaps less destructive to society and self worth, but it's perhaps affecting a different group of women with a different demographic and power set.<br /><br />Yes, Ms. Sandberg is a billionaire executive with excellent and supportive family structures, and her message is more for breaking the glass ceiling than addressing more basic women's rights movements. It is especially unuseful for families whose primary breadwinner is the woman or is entirely run by single women, or the wage slave dual income families who aren't in any position to improve their working lot. But her advice is still valuable in many many contexts, and her tone empowering and forthright and compelling. I would highly recommend this book.

B004ZMWUCU|4.0|first time reading with this author. enjoyed the book . had a hard time with  the abuse on children.<br />it had a surprise ending which I suspected  i thought it good reading
0374214913|4.0|I just read this for my book club - our last book was Cleopatra so we needed something light!  I was intrigued by the premise and got caught up in the story, which I don't need to summarize here.  Others have also compared this to a Dan Brown novel - to me it is like a Da Vinci Code \\"light,\\" a little fluffy, but original and intriguing nonetheless.  Others have also criticized the lack of character development - this novel was not a character study so that didn't bother me.  I actually enjoyed the wide range of quirky characters from young to old, even if some of them were a bit one-dimensional(and yes, I would love to have a rich friend that I could call on for an adventure too).  I was compelled to finish the book quickly in order to see how the \\"mystery\\" would be resolved.  Everything was tied up a bit neatly, but I think it worked for this kind of book - and left it open to a sequel.  This book may not stand the test of time, but it is fresh and relevant now in this age of going paperless and where technological giants like Google are involved in who-knows-what.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I think I've had this case for 2 to 3 years now.  Can I tell you how many times I've dropped my phone?  No I can't, because it's too many to count.  On tile, on concrete, everywhere and from every height.  I have absolutely no damage to my phone (I will knock on wood now).  So, if you are checking out this item because you're not sure you should spend $40+ on a case and would like to save some money, just stop reading and buy it.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|The show is different from the fan favorite Sherlock and that's ok; the stories are enjoying and the characters are for the most part believable. Worth at least a three episode sampling
B008UZCCE4|4.0|Like everyone else in the world, I instantly went cross-eyed at the idea of Guy Ritchie making a Sherlock Holmes movie.<br /><br />Sure enough, this is not your dad's Sherlock. Or your grandpa's either. \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" is a thoroughly eccentric take on the legendary detective -- energetic, action-packed and clever, with more than a hint of steampunk and black magic. It gets kind of silly at times, but Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law keep the story going strong.<br /><br />As the story opens, a young woman is about to be sacrificed in a black magic ritual by the evil Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong). However, Sherlock Holmes (Downey) and Watson (Law) thwart him just in time for the police to arrive. Three months later, Blackwood is executed -- but not before he tells Holmes that three more people will die, and the world will change.<br /><br />But then his tomb is broken open... from the inside. And at the same time, Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) tries to hire Holmes to track down a man who is then found dead in Blackwood's tomb. As Holmes tries to unravel this case, he discovers the existence of a strange upper-crust magical cult, who are slowly being killed off by Blackwood's mysterious powers. Has Sherlock Holmes run up against supernatural forces he cannot explain or fight?<br /><br />This is not an adaptation of one of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories -- this is more a movie that takes the IDEA of Sherlock Holmes and applies it to a big, bombastic, quirky action movie. Ritchie directs the movie with a sharp, kinetic style, and he keeps things from getting too stuffy with lots of fight scenes (including Holmes mapping out every fight in his head before throwing a punch).<br /><br />His steampunky vision of London has a lot of dark, dripping corners, and Ritchie happily trots Sherlock and Watson down into them -- river boats, Parliament's basement, and grimy rituals down in some catacombs. The movie's biggest problem is that the action sometimes gets silly, such as the massive fight at the shipyard in which Holmes and Watson almost get run over by a ship.<br /><br />But he balances out all the action with plenty of funny moments (Holmes repeatedly paralyzing poor Gladstone) and witty dialogue (\\"No girl wants to marry a doctor who can't tell if a man's dead or not!\\"). This is definitely a movie that loves Holmes at his most eccentric.<br /><br />The main reason this works so well is because of Downey. He is probably one of the best actors of our age, and he gives Sherlock a bright-eyed, quirky, almost manic energy, as well as a touch of Asperger's (he literally CANNOT understand why Watson would want to get married and retire from crimefighting). You can truly believe that this guy has a brain like a supercomputer.<br /><br />Law also gives an excellent performance as a young, vital Watson who seems to have a love-hate relationship with Holmes -- they're best friends, but Holmes' eccentricities are driving him nuts. Rachel McAdams gives a solid performance as Holmes' lady thief ex-girlfriend, and Mark Strong is wonderfully, sonorously sinister as the villain, who may or may not be a sorcerer.<br /><br />\\"Sherlock Holmes\\" isn't actually based on any Sherlock Holmes stories, but Guy Ritchie's sharp-edged direction and Downey's quirky performance make it a fun experience. Just try to swallow the sillier action scenes.e massive fight at the shipyard in which Holmes and Watson almost get run over by a ship.<br /><br />But he balances out all the action with plenty of funny moments (Holmes repeatedly paralyzing poor Gladstone) and witty dialogue (\\"No girl wants to marry a doctor who can't tell if a man's dead or not!\\").

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever.<br /><br />I loved the graphics, plus the characters were cool and funky. I do wish that there were others ways to earn a major coin amount because I'm trying to get Kim, the limited edition girl but I only have about 45,000 coins out of 95,00 :l. I also love the funny inspector guy and his dog. Do you think that in the game you could make it able to change what he looks like and his breed of dog? Please listen to my suggestions, I'm only trying to make the game go p a st five stars!!!! Keep making games like temple run, good and PROFITABLE idea. Please listen and carefully read this advice, thanks. C:
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|I really liked the game and the graphics are amazing!  The only issue I had was how short the game was.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  I have played through all 3 difficulties and each one does require more effort yet not impossible to master.  I love the different modes and visual styles.  I can honestly say you hit home with quite a few of my favorite classic gaming memories while making them fresh at the same time.<br /><br />My only trouble is trying to earn all of the speed achievements... especially on the pong levels!
1455527475|4.0|Admittedly, I was hoping for something juicier. A tome of epic proportions and heavy-handed indictments.<br /><br />It was some of that. In a general sense, I think Smith gives us a good 360 on what wall street actually looks like on the inside. I think what he does do is advocate for the Volcker rule that would limit the investment banks ability to bet against their clients. The Volcker rule is a necessity to restore some semblance of equitable outcomes from a wall street that has turned capitalism into an extreme deference of inequitable outcome for the fading middle and the oligarchs.<br /><br />Nonetheless, a great read. I listened to the audio version and Smith does a quality job reading his own book.
B00BIVN82M|1.0|I've loved Michael Buble since his \\"It's Time\\" album.<br /><br />As for this album, which I'm sorry to say I bought (with the exception of \\"It's A Beautiful Day,\\" which is great), it's just really, really bad.<br />Love Michael's Sinatra influence, but to just cover Sinatra song after Sinatra song is, just, BORING.  And this album goes complete cornball by going WAY back to a 1930's influence.  Really?  What were they thinking?<br /><br />I would have enjoyed more new, original compositions like so many songs on \\"It's Time.\\"<br /><br />I'm just beyond STUNNED at how bad this album truly is.

B001DRF84W|4.0|I'm always a little surprised when I hear the complaints regarding this movie.  I will admit that it doesn't live up to other great super hero movies such as Dark Knight or Iron Man, but I think a lot of people miss the good points of this film.<br /><br />Many reviewers who don't like this movie will still admit that the CGI work is very impressive.  The animation on the Hulk is very realistic (if you can say that about a mutated fictional creature) and his interactions with real life objects is very convincing.  The shot of him yelling while the water splashes off of him is probably my single favorite moment in the movie.<br /><br />The story line has been called \\"dark\\" which I agree with, but I don't see this as a downside to the movie.  I'm not even sure how you can have a happy-go-lucky film based on a character that gets mad.  I like how the story slows down to allow us to get to know the characters more personally.  This is a very different style then many other super hero movies, but I think it really works for this story.<br /><br />I think my favorite aspect of this movie is the use of multiple camera angles.  This makes it feel more like a comic book and adds a whole new layer to the film.  Surprisingly, I can't recall seeing this technique in any other movie.<br /><br />I've seen the 2008 remake and didn't even like that version as much.  Unlike this edition, I felt the 2008 movie was just a cookie cutter super hero movie that was way over the top and not as captivating.  True, it's not ground breaking or shocking, but at least worthy of 3 1/2 stars.

B005RYF5JA|5.0|I caught the last of this lovely show on OETA and ended up ordering the dvd so I could enjoy the whole show.  It is such a lovely show.  If you are a fan of Celtic music at all you will be enchanted by this show.  I've never seen anything else quite like this program. The orchestra, the costumes and of course these talented beautiful girls come together for a show you will want to watch again and again.  The old Irish folk songs are certainly done well, along with other contemporary songs.  The song they do with the children will bring tears to your eyes, and the dancing will make you want to get up and join them.  My son just told me they are coming on a tour in our area.  I would love to see this show live, but if you can't these dvds make it possible to see them at home.  I plan to buy some of the others.  It is not just talent and a beautiful show, it is wholesome entertainment, which is very hard to find.  You will not regret buying this product!

0374531269|5.0|Ismeal Beah's,  A Long Way Gone, is a compelling novel about the life of children soldiers in Sierra Leone, specially the life of Ismeah Beah himself. It is an extremely heartbreaking but captivating story of the hardships Beah experienced while being forced to serve for the resistance army. From a feminist standpoint, reading this novel was difficult. As women at times are treated unfairly or abused for their gender, it was difficult to read the novel knowing these children were being taken advantage of due to their age, something similar to being female in that it cannot be helped and therefore not abused. On the other hand from a globalization perspective, knowing the demand for diamonds from Sierra Leone is one of the reasons for driving forward the resistance in the hopes of harvesting and selling the diamonds to collect money for the weapons and ammo and continue on with the war. Overall, this was a great novel, amazing in fact, as it as extremely detailed and so well written that I actually felt like I was there next to Ishmeal experiencing everything myself as well. I would recommend it to ANYONE as it is a great read that can really open the reader's eyes to the exploitation of children and the outside world in general.

B009LGO88E|5.0|This is exactly what the 3Ds XL needs. Works great right out the box. Put in the battery slide in the 3DS XL and get to gaming. Works great with titles that are compatible but I also use it because it feels comfortable in my hands.
B00BP3DPJY|5.0|I'm sure the musician would hate the title of this review but I think it gives the reader a good idea of what this sounds like. This is an amazing record. I have only listened to it twice so I have not, by any means, discovered it's nuances (probably why it still sounds reminiscent of MMJ) but it is delightful. It has a psychedelic, etherial echo of melancholy. That is EXACTLY my favorite thing.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Simple to use, and I like the fact that it includes the weather. I also like there are different tones to wake up to.
0470876417|4.0|I originally ordered this as a requirement for an MBA class. However, I found it very useful in describing how to develop a business model canvas document that is extremely helpful in writing a business plan.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The hunger games is a great trilogy. Suzanne Collins knows how to  make you attached to one of her characters, and you feel the pain when they die. I thank Suzanne Collins for the hunger games trilogy.
B009AMANH4|5.0|This is a great movie for anyone interested in the history of the Lincoln presidency and the issues surrounding the Civil War in the United States. As Hollywood usually does, they embellish the details somewhat, but the movie will hold your interest and educate you at the same time.
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|This game offers a so they call a &quot;closest graphics to a console on a smartphone&quot;<br />Well I kind of disagree. The graphics are ok and the kindle fire it self runs the app very well. The app takes about 10-20minutes to download and takes up around 1.87GB of memory. I don't know if it's just me but it seems to me that this game is trying to match with the latest call of duty: cod black ops 2. Taking you in the future of warfare. And it has many similar things like remote control drones and touch pad remote controls which  I though looked exactly like the one in black ops 2. And just.the campaign is basically to simple even on the hardest level. This is bad for people who want a challenge.your allies can basically can take unlimited bullets and never seem to die (unless of course they aren't, someone important)<br />When you walk up to an enemy you have the option to knife him and you can notice that you can practically knife them from 5ft away. The gun models are great. They are very realistic. But the pistols are the exact opposite. Honestly the pistols look like cardboard boxes painted black with glow sticks as iron sights that a 5 year old son made. The multiplayer is my favorite part about the game. There is a wide variety of maps and many different game modes. If you made a multiplayer account on a previous modern combat then you can use that account on this game as well. The only problem is that there isn't that many people online. But overall multiplayer is really fun. Some problems that they could possibly fix is the sound affects, the reason for this is because when someone is firing there gun from about 15ft away it sounds like a gunshot from a mile away.this makes the game a little less realistic. I give this game a 3 because of the effort put into it. But the graphics aren't what they said it was.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|These are very short informative talks on innovative and creative solutions and ideas. The most memorable for me are the ones that deal with problems in the developing world - a possible solution to desertification stands out, as does the child who invented a waterless bathing system. Watch TED talks to learn about the latest ideas from the author of a concept, way before the research gets extracted and put in a book.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Small, light, & easily fits in my pocket.  Keeps my knife sharp with a few passes.  My biggest problem with this is that everyone always wants to borrow it!  I have to keep an eye on it to make sure I get it back!
B00C5ZORES|5.0|When I first listened to My Songs Know What You Did, I wasn't convinced that I was going to like the new FOB album. Then I listened to it a few more times, really loudly, in the car. It got stuck in my head - what is the line from Dead on Arrival, \\"But the songs you grow to like, don't stick at first\\"? Then I got the album and fell completely in love with Young Volcanoes. I listened to that song so many times the first two days that I could sing it front to back without thinking about it. Now I've moved on to Where Did The Party Go, stuck in my head the whole weekend.<br /><br />So, just like Folie a Deux, this album is growing on me. I miss the poppy punk from the old days but, no one, not even a favorite band, can stay in one place forever. I am very much looking forward to the concert, Fall Out Boy didn't disappoint with this one, it just needs a couple of listens before it sticks.
1423124111|5.0|A beautiful book that features all those charming posters seen around the parks. The coolest thing is theses are posters from parks around the world! Gorgeous illustrations! A must-have for any Disney fan!
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|All genres of music are represented with many subdivisions in each category, and the music stream is in high quality when listened to in good headphones or speakers. Totally recommend.
B00CHI5F5S|2.0|This was interesting story, badly told.  An impressive array of acting talent is wasted in a cliche fest, TV movie presentation
B005OK721G|3.0|It is an action movie my husband  watched it and feel it  is not as excited compare to the movie Taken.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is a book of great storytelling and memorable characters. An emotional journey through Vivian's life keeps the pages turning.
0765342294|5.0|If you found The Hunger Games suitable for your children, then you'll also enjoy Ender's Game.  Hugo & Nebula Award Winner, and soon to be a movie starring Harrison Ford.  Excellent book for high schooler and college level.
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|This is with no doubt one of the best movies i have ever seen i my whole life. It is not only recommended for people who like superhero movies, but for everyone looking for a complex-almost realistic story where good and evil are mixed up and is not that easy to see the differences. Here is a funny quiz about it [...]
055357342X|5.0|...and much more enjoyable than the HBO adaption which leaves out too much and adds plots that were never in the book.  If you want the real deal, then you really should read the whole series!!
B000W91RUG|5.0|The original idea may seem simple: one cute girl moves on near two geeky guys, but the implications of this simple event has taken this series to be the hit it has been. Not only every episode is extremely funny but also, you can learn a lot about the  science world with this perfectly performed characters. Here is a funny quiz i found on the internet about it [...]
B009LXEBD4|5.0|This CD has every Kelly Clarkson song that I love. This CD is a good buy and i highly recommend.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I had seen the movie but not read the book now that I have  read the book I know the story. The book was awesome
B00C2C637I|4.0|I read this book when I was younger, and it introduced me to the world of science fiction. The characters are interesting and the story is engaging. The writing is superb. Lots of imagery.
