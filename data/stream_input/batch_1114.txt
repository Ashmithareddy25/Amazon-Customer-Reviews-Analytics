030746363X|4.0|This is not really a book that is read cover to cover (although I did). As the author notes, it is more a reference manual that one can dive into as desired to research solutions on improving health and the body.<br /><br />The books contains a huge amount of information to help you better understand what works and doesn't when it comes to your body. As the author notes, he is not a doctor, however he certainly has done the research and backs up his claims with innumerable real world tests. Many of the results are counter intuitive which sometimes make then hard to accept. Yet, as the author notes, they are merely a starting point for your own research into what works for you.<br /><br />The book covers many areas including diet and exercise. It would be difficult to find an area not covered by the book that would interest someone looking to improve their physical well being. If you are looking for something that syntheses much of the current research out their on a wide range of topics then this book is certainly worth the investment. I see it as an excellent reference book that can be referred to a new topics about self improvement pique my interest.<br /><br />The book is easy to read but can get bogged down in some very analytical information. This can be a bit boring if you are not so interested in that topic, however it can be an absolute boon if you are. The level of detail and specifics are what makes this a great reference book but in most cases only part of the content will be appealing at any one time. That is why it should be treated as a reference book and a guide on the journey of physical self improvement.
B000V1MMLI|5.0|This is the brilliant solo album from Serj and it is outstanding. It has his usual cutting, intelligent lyrics, backed up by some amazing music. This is all the more impressive as it is written, engineered, produced and mainly played all by Serj. All the tracks are great and get better with repeated listening, although 'Empty Walls' and 'Honking Antelope' are particular favourites for me. This limited edition version is well worth the extra money. You get the initial superb album, an additional bonus CD, the case is a hardback book which has a great selection of illustrated lyrics (by the same artist as Serj's 'Cool Garden' book) and some more poetry. You also get a limited edition member card which gives you access to a Serj Tankian deluxe website. You can't get much better than that! Highly recommended, for the music alone but the package makes this extra special. If you like SOAD you'll like this, simple as that. A top effort from Serj and so good to have him back in my music listening life!<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

0618918248|4.0|This is one of the most stimulating books i've read in a while. It's not often I've felt inclined to go back to the start and read a book again as soon as I've finished, but this book made me consider it. As usual for Dawkins the writing style is engaging and clear and his arguments are as lucid as ever. The ideas explored are bound to be controversial, but if you look past that, you have some great ideas to explore, as well as potentially changing your views on life and religion. This book makes you question other ideas you may hold and that can only be a good thing, even if Dawkins isn't able to sway you from your beliefs/ideas. If you are secure enough in your beliefs, and are willing to at least give his theory's a fair chance, then this is an incredible book to read, it has the potential to make you view things in a new light and what more could you want from a book? Well worth a read.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

006019250X|5.0|Coelho's most famous book and the first one I read. This is fairly typical of his style and offers his usual words of spiritual wisdom in an easy accessible (almost fairy story style) read. It also has some lovely colour illustrations which really add to the book and make this a special edition to give as a gift. His books are very simplistic, but have some interesting philosophy and some nice ways of phrasing timeless ideas. As long as you expect an easy, innocuous read, and don't expect the lofty spiritual read often touted, then you should be fine. This is a great story, with beautiful sentiments and is worth it for that alone.
160094048X|5.0|I am really enjoying this cookbook.  I love that there are big, colorful photos of almost all the cookies.  Also, a nice description of the cookies, in addition to the recipe information.  So far, I've made the Macadamia Ginger Crunch Cookies and they are soooo delicious!  One of my best creations, ever!  The book includes recipes for old favorites, that I used to eat before becoming vegan.  Can't wait to try them.
B00005JLEU|5.0|My first look at Miyazaki's work, (as it is for for many westerners no doubt) and I was blown away. The animation is out of this world, both in quality and in imagination. The story line is original and different and follows a girl trying to bring back her parents from a curse where they are turning into pigs and follows her adventures as she tries to achieve this. The world she travels in is beautiful, weird and magical to watch. Well worth a look by anyone, but be warned you may get hooked and there is a host of other Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki work out there to tantalise and delight.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

Even though I give this 5 stars I would recommend to buy the RAT5, a few more pennies for the extra features is worth it. Profile manager is pointless, the only worthwhile setting in the manager is the ability to change its DPI... nothing special.
0143039431|5.0|This is a powerful, beautiful book and one that should be read by everyone irrespective of age or gender. It's tight, evocative language moves you to your core and stays with you long after the book has finished. The frustrations and anger the families of dust-bowl era America must have felt are made starkly clear and the might and sway of corporations was evident even back when this book was written. An immensely readable and powerful novel that will leave you enriched and moved.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B004CLYKLI|3.0|I realize this is a memoir, however it is so poorly written. I was shocked being that Amy Chua is a Yale college professor. I read the book for book club and I must say it was the most lively disscussion from eight woman I have every been involved in. Three woman are asian (all moms), in fact all but one of the eight are moms with all various age children. Most did not like her \\"Tiger Mom\\" style of parenting, including me and felt Amy Chua was narcessistic. I did feel compelled to read this book to the end, however it was mostly because I wanted to know how her children responded to this style of parenting. I thought it was interesting that she did not have this same style with her dogs and basically allowed them to do whatever they wanted! I feel Amy Chua raised her children in a bubble not allowing them to truly explore and I dentify what their passion is, as she dictated it for them. What I resented was the way she \\"dissed\\" western style parenting being substandard to Chinese parenting. Yes she did \\"produce\\" amazing musicians and very well educated children, that being said they still have to function and negotiate in a \\"Western\\" society which I believe Amy Chua did a disservice to them by NOT preparing for that socialization.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|A great film with some fascinating information. The images and diagrams really make this film something else and Gore comes across as a dedicated guy with a very lucid writing and presentation style and compelling argument. It remains to be seen if we can act on this, and other pertinent info, to make the changes we need. Highly recommended if you're interested in climate change and want a good introduction or alternatively a beautifully presented film on the subject.

0812932293|5.0|This is the highly readable account of Branson's life and business ventures to date. He comes across as extremely personable and honest, with a great deal of integrity. His battles with BA make fascinating reading and his various balloon flights and other 'extreme' sports adventures make for exciting interludes to his business life. The picture plates are also very clear and give a good cross section of his life.

1400049628|5.0|Like many reviewers here I spent time in my youth discussing zombie survival with friends after another gore-fest night in front of the TV. This book captures those conversations perfectly and elaborates them with real imagination and with an unnerving touch of reality. Again, as many reviewers note, you start reading it for fun, but as you let yourself get immersed in the ideas, and you relive your own musings on the theme, you find yourself starting to seriously consider your options in the light of this comprehensive survival guide. It is funny in places, no doubt, but it is also a great addition to the Zombie genre and a new take on an old theme. Well written, great little illustrations and well thought out ideas make for an enjoyable read. Worth a go.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B00005JPAO|5.0|This is a great film, looking inside the life of the royal family as they deal with the death of Diana. It shows how the country mourned her loss and how the royals found it hard to connect with the people they ruled. Tony Blair comes across as being in touch with the public mood and it is a good reminder of how he was when he started out and before the power corrupted! A few characters don't come across too well (Cherie Blair and Prince Phillip), but you tend to relate to the Queen by the end of the film and understand a little more how she was brought up in a different time and felt unable to connect with the country when they looked to her for a degree of leadership. All the parts are acted well and I found the film length to be perfect, with enough info and story before it became overlong and boring. Overall a good film, showing the more human side to the Queen and a snapshot of a turbulent time in the royals life. Worth a viewing.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I watched this version after rereading the book. I thought it was wonderful. Many parts were taken word for word out of the story, which I always appreciate. For the first time, even though I've read this book multiple times, I was really able to \\"get\\" how she falls for Mr. Rochester. Hearing the conversations out of the book, paired with the actors' facial expressions and vocal intonations, really made the story come even more alive to me. This has always been my favorite book, and now this is my favorite movie. :) Enjoy!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is an amazing series about our incredible planet. The series uses new and revolutionary filming techniques which are often explored in the Planet earth diaries at the end of each episode. You know you're on safe ground as soon as you hear Attenborough's voice narrating and it lends the series some serious credibility. The themes this series covers truly makes you appreciate the diversity of our planet and I agree with other reviewers that this should be shown to kids at school. It would really foster a delight and respect for our planet that is desperately needed right now. I defy you to watch this series and not be left breathless by some of the things they show you. Worth every penny.
B001EO2UJK|5.0|Let me start off by saying that only recently have I discovered (almost ironic choice of words considering that the music is slightly older than me) how great the Peter Gabriel era of Genesis was. When I was growing up, there was only the Phil Collins, Tony Banks, and Mike Rutherford version of Genesis, which I equated to pop/rock which was never really my taste. This box set could not be farther from the 80's version of Genesis that I knew, although there are a few songs that sound like a foreshadowing of what they would sound like in the 80s. In particular the song 'I Know What I Like' could be from that era, but as I say this it is still better than what they did in the 80's. Additionally, I discovered how good of a drummer that Phil Collins is(was?) and that Tony Banks is a great keyboardist. It is unfortunate that they didn't flaunt these talents more in the 80's and later.<br /><br />What led me to try out some of the older Genesis is the fact that I have always liked Peter Gabriel's solo albums. I had bought the MP3s for 'Selling England By the Pound' and 'Foxtrot' first. These are great albums, and I was hooked since. The next step for me was to get the full fledged CDs for these albums. Yes, they are that good for me to purchase twice! This then led me to the box set where you could buy all of the PG era Genesis in a box set.<br /><br />I took the plunge and bought the box set, even though the almost $100 Amazon price tag is a bit off putting for what amounts to 5 CDs with some extras and an extra DVD of rarities. I have since realized that this is a fair value for what you receive. Admittedly, I was a bit reserved on reading some of the other reviews on Amazon. Some questions about the quality of the mixing/mastering when compared to the older versions. From an ear that has not heard the previous versions, I would say that the mixing is fine as a whole and that if this is your only reason for holding off then I wouldn't worry about it if you are new comer to old Genesis. From my perspective, ignorance is bliss and I am completely happy with the purchase. The songs are great, sound great, and the extras included are a nice addition.<br /><br />Admittedly, I haven't watched all of the DVDs yet, but I would like to comment on a few highlights that I have found that I haven't seen in the other reviews that I have read.<br /><br />-For the DTS/Dolby Digital viewing of the 'Lamb Lies Down On Broadway', they run the slide show from the concert tour as well as some video clips from the actual tour. This is a nice touch and is appreciated for those of us who couldn't have seen the show live.<br /><br />-One of the extras on the Lamb Lies Down On Broadway is a video of the fellows playing 'Supper's Ready' live for a TV show. Here you get to see a live example of PG's penchant for theatrics during one of their live performances.<br /><br />-On the Foxtrot DVD, there is another half hour video of the fellows playing on Belgian TV playing songs from Nursery Cryme ( 'Musical Box', 'The Return of the Giant Hogweed' and 'The Fountain of Salamacis' are the ones that I can remember). As a side note, I was able to find some the videos from the box set on a popular video streaming site.<br /><br />All in all, I am pleased with this purchase and would recommend this to any new comer to Genesis that likes Peter Gabriel as well as epic songs and great musicianship.From my perspective, ignorance is bliss and I am completely happy with the purchase.

B00007B5VM|5.0|Although less coherent than their other albums dues to it's 'unplanned' and outtakes nature, this is still a powerful album from an outstanding band. You still get the raw riffs and lyrics, all packaged in SOAD unique style. I love this album, as I do all their music, and would say it is worth it for 'Boom' alone, just listen to the lyrics on it and be blown away. An intelligent, rockin' band, with a lot to say in as fun a way as possible. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
0545265355|5.0|I absolutely love this series, I would recommend it for any ages middle school and up, even adults! Once you read the first one, you are hooked, it's so worth it to buy the entire series so you can go from book to book without waiting. I say, if you're on the fence, BUY THIS SERIES because if you or who you bought it for doesn't like them, then it's almost guarenteed that someone you know will love them and they won't go to waste.
0385474547|4.0|This is a beautiful book following a tribal member as he lives his life and tries to look after himself and his family. It is written extremely well and although the language is poetic and beautiful, I have to say it didn't move me or emotionally involve me in the story as much as I anticipated (hence the 4 stars). Never the less it is a perfectly pleasant read and kept me engrossed for a few days and the ending was perfectly in character and a fitting conclusion. You feel anger and shame at how African nations were treated by colonial powers and it is interesting to explore it from the Africans point of view rather than from a historical or political analysis angle. Overall a good read and worth the time it took to read.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B000NQRE0K|4.0|The last time I checked, Scotland was still ruled by London, and is still the domain of the 'British' (actually German) royal family.<br /><br />Braveheart was a huge deal when it first came out. I never really watched the film properly until recently. As a frequent cinema-goer since my youth I was not a part of the mid-nineties cultural phenomenon that was Braveheart's release in Scotland. I did turn up at the the cinema, the old Odeon in Edinburgh, but the queue went round the block (the literal term for a blockbuster) and there was no way in hell I was prepared to wait for three hours on a gray September afternoon (a choice I came to regret). Every subsequent attempt since then was blocked. I never rented the video as I didn't want to watch in pan-and-scan. The fact that every single living Scottish person had seen it apart from myself really got on my nerves, and I was quite bitter about it. And then, as the fever died down, I just kind of forgot about it and moved on.<br /><br />Watching it fully as an adult I think I probably enjoy it more now that I would have done as a teenager. It's certainly a huge epic right up there with the best of them. Mel Gibson captures the pretty side of Scotland wonderfully with his scope photography accompanied by James Horner's bittersweet score. The film never really feels three hours long, the time just disappears.<br /><br />Nearly every notable Scottish actor (apart from Connery and Connelly) appears at some point. From the brilliant (Brian Cox) to the dreary and pretentious (Peter Mullan). Keep a lookout for Tommy Flanagan too, in one of his earlier roles.<br /><br />The battle scenes are impressive, but I wish there were more gory. Gibson's first cut of the film was apparently bloodier, I wish it had remained intact. But despite the grim satisfaction of seeing the English aggressors getting splattered the fact that Scotland IS still ruled by England kind renders Wallace's bravery irrelevant. It may have been 700 years ago, but I hate the fact that he ultimately died for nothing. We DON'T have a country of our own, plain and simple.<br /><br />Maybe one day...in my lifetime.<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks and sound great in 2.35:1 1080p and DTS HD-MA.

B00005O3YU|5.0|This truly is the definitive Ray Charles. You get a wide selection of his output from his early recordings to his eighties duets with the likes of Chaka Khan as featured on Quincy Jones' 'Back on the Block' album. Ray Charles' songwriting is superb, with the early stuff very clearly influenced by Gospel and church music of the time, but with his own twist. If you've seen the film 'Ray' you will know just what to expect and this doesn't disappoint. If you haven't seen the film, buy this anyway as it has some great blues and soul on here and should be in anyone's collection. I also recommend the film for those who like this album, as it provides a good insight into Ray and his music. This truly is the definitive collection and is a joy to listen to.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
030746363X|3.0|Tim has some good research that this book does TRY to relay.  I really jumped into this book after all the reviews and interviews.  And, I do think there is stuff to what he says.  But, this book, more than probably other fitness type books, is even more difficult to follow for the average person.  Tim has the advantage of being able to track everything with all kind of tests and resources.  He advertises options for us to do the same, but the price and availability isn't realistic.  I looked at the SpectraCell testing for micronutrients, locally in Salt Lake. I would have had to shell out $400 for the first test.  As much as I would like to have that information, I cannot justify that.  And without the ability to do constant testing, it's difficult to make the adjustments that Tim talks about.  And, that is necessary because we're all different.  Tim mentions testing he did with other people, but the feel of the book, is this is mostly about results from him.  What works for one person, rarely works for all.<br /><br />My bigger complaint about this book is how it is put together.  It feels haphazard.  Fat loss and muscle gain and then 15 minute female orgasm.  If you want more fat loss like targeted areas use hidden passwords and go online for bonus material.  What?  He says there was too much content for one book.  Ok, so why not put a book together that has a targeted focus.  Why couldn't this book be targeted for fat loss and fitness and then another targeted one for sexual performance.  The only reason I can think of is that the 15 minute female orgasm was known to bring attention to the book, so it had to be in there for sales.<br /><br />The chapters start with a personal tale that goes to experience and experiments and results.  But, they're often hard to follow, as he'll throw out supplements and this and that.  That's fine if conclusion of the chapter really wrapped things up with guideline that included everything you needed to know exactly what to do.They are not.  I often re-read and took notes and then Googled for more information on what he was referring.  It's just not outlined with specific enough guidelines to be confident how to follow, what you think he is saying.  And forget the index.  I really think someone put that together really fast after they decided what to put in the book and just inserted things by a quick scan.  Rarely has it directed me by looking up things I know I read earlier.<br /><br />This book needs at least another edition with a targeted focus and clearer organization to be the great book it was advertised as being.  The potential is there.  For now, get the idea of what he is talking about online (it's referenced all over with the fat loss being the key thing that most people want.)  Wait a few more years for Tim to use input on this book to organize a more effective book to add to your library.
0812979656|5.0|This is probably one of the most beautiful books you are ever likely to read. Roy's descriptions are rich and extremely evocative and the pace and storyline will keep you the turning pages and completely immersed in the world of the characters. The language used is so beautiful that phrases and snippets will stay with you for days and weeks afterwards, and cliched as it may sound, this is one of those books that leave your life richer for having read it.

0374290024|5.0|The book is \\"Why The West Rules, for Now\\", written by Ian Morris. I heard an interview he gave on the radio down here and was impressed and lo and behold it was under the Xmas tree. Couldn't put it down once started and would read untill eyes went blurry. This guy has real credentials and address questions I have often wondered about. It is way beyond casual reading but done so in a fashion not overly scholarly so that it can be followed by the likes of me. Sort of a post doctoral dissertation in language suitable for mere undergraduates. He has some rather startling conclusions in the later chapters and outlines the history and reasons for them in the early chapters. He gets a bit obtuse from time to time, maybe so he can hold a more knowledgeable  audience, but never sinks into the pit of sophistry. It is a history book just as much as a book on economics, which tends to make my eyes glaze over anyway. Never happens. A considerable amount of his conclusions is based on very recent archeology, the ink is barely dry on some of these pupblications. All peer reviewed.<br />  Full of interesting historical facts, like the Muslims inventing ice cream and pasta in Sicily in 750 AD and the fact that the US military invented the internet. and are leading the field in robotics and nanotechknowledgy.  Maybe you knew, I didn't. He makes constant use of notes at the bottom of a page so as not to sidetrack the reader, but there are enough of them for a book on it's own. Like the fact that the Chinese were stealing manhole covers in Chicago in 2004 and shipping them home because they are so short of steel. They have few natural resources but coal.<br />  I have to admit it makes me very worried about the future because what he postulates is not new, it has all happened before and there is really no reason it won't happen again. We are no less prone to catastrophic blunders than our predecessors. He points out that it is men of genius and blundering idiots who populate the history books and the latter out number the former by far. It is China about which we have to be concerned, not Islam, which is hardly mentioned. China has broken up 4 times in the past and descended into anarchy, and shows signs of repeating. He does point out that it is only a matter of when, not if, fundamentalist Islam will get the bomb. Worry.<br />  He quotes scientists in other discplines and does not give short shrift to those who disagree with him. I had read Gavin Menzies' books about the Chinese fleets in the early 15 th century and although I believed him, Menzies is given little credence. He was only a Naval Officer.

B000U618C8|5.0|This is another top album from Jose Gonzalez. It is very much in the same vein as veneer, which is no bad thing, and like that album it gets better with repeated listening. It doesn't have quite as much impact as veneer but you still get his rhythmic, almost percussive, guitar playing and his superb vocals layered over the top. Some songs hits you at once, like the album closer 'cycling trivialities', whilst others grow on you. I agree that the lyrics seem a touch more mature, but they weren't that bad on veneer anyway! Overall another great album from Jose to put on and drift away to.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B004CRR9G0|5.0|It seems to me that Ghibli find it impossible to create a bad film! Nausicaa is yet another addition to their already high quality catalogue of animation. It follows a princess from a remote kingdom as she tries to save her people, the planet and keep the peace between the warring factions around her. The animation is outstanding and is less cute than 'The Cat Returns' or 'My Neighbour Totoro' and less fantastical than 'Spirited away', it is very gritty yet still as lush and detailed as all Ghibli animations. I'd say this is one aimed more at the adult audience and will make for a couple of hours great viewing. If you enjoy this film I highly recommend the seven series books, they expand the story and lend it a greater depth than the film and really give a good understanding of what the film is trying to achieve.

B00000IIXH|5.0|It is rare for an artists outtakes and demos to rival their recorded work, but in 18 Tracks you have exactly that. This is a great selection of some of the tracks from the main boxset and is fairly representative of what you are likely to expect. It is good album in it's own right and perfect for when you haven't got time for the whole boxset. The last three tracks do not feature on the original set so there is some incentive for die-hard fans to buy this as well, and 'The Promise' is one of my all time Springsteen favourites. Any of these tracks could of featured on an album. There are acoustic demos, full band rave ups and up to date outtakes. Bruce could always write a brilliant song, but these hidden tracks demonstrate just how prolific and constant his ability is. Worth every penny.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B00005ARS9|5.0|You cannot beat the Beach Boys for that fun time summer feeling. I defy you to put on 'Barbara Ann' and not smile like a loon. There are so many good tracks on this album that it keeps the party going and for that nostalgic summer rush, with the great melodies and harmonies that they are famous for, you can't go wrong. A superb best of.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B004MMEIK0|1.0|I have a problem where I must finish a book I started.  Its a flaw because God's Blood this book was terrible.  The lead character was so annoying.  Shanna spent the whole book in love with Roman, then out of love, then in love, then out of love. If that wasn't bad enough the lead guy, Roman, spent the whole book in love with her, then not good enough for her... you get the point.  The plot was pretty dumb along with the title.  I should have read the reviews.  This books savings grace is that it was short.  It didn't take long to put this book out of my life forever.
B00002ND77|5.0|This is the amazing Spike Lee film looking at the life of Malcolm X. You see Denzel Washington in probably his best ever role, breathing life into this complex historical figure. It really makes you understand what things shaped Malcolms ideas and vision as he progressed through his life. The music is superb, the acting is great and the direction is an unique and captivating as ever. Not only is this great to watch and will keep you engrossed throughout, but you will come away learning something about this influential man. Well worth a viewing.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B00005T5YK|5.0|The DVD Audio version of Hotel California is a collector's gem.  Since DVD Audio discs are no longer manufactured, you need to be a surround sound fan and audio buff to appreciate the sound.  A few of these now expensive discs are scarce and in high demand, including this one.  If your home theater system will play DVD audio or if you are lucky enough to have one of the auto systems that will play them such as the Acura ELS system or the Bose system in the 2007-2009 Escalade, newer Porsches, etc., the music will blow your mind.  These discs were all remastered from the original recordings to create the surround effects and update the quality and resolution of the sound.  The Eagles are one of the most in demand however Fleetwood Mac,  Steely Dan, Donald Fagan and Foreigner are also top picks.  The Beatles Love collection is still aviailable in stores and it is one of the best.  Your enjoyment of Hotel California will be an ultimate for any Eagles fan...in fact, you might not ever leave.
B0009P42S2|5.0|I have to start by saying I found this film to be incredible. The animation was outstanding and although the dubbing isn't perfect, i've seen a lot worse on Japanese animation dubs. The English voices fit the characters pretty well, although you can't beat the original Japanese voice and reading the subtitles. The storyline was great and although it did feel a bit slow for the first half, this only made the second half race forward at break neck speed and add to the drama and action, which I can only guess was the intention. I agree that this is probably the most visually stunning animation outside of Ghibli films and the level of detail is simply breathtaking. The extras disc is great, with well over an hour of interviews and featurettes that give a great view on the animators, directors and voice stars opinions on this film, as well as providing information on animation layering and other techniques. I have to say it makes for a wonderful overall package. If you buy this you will own an amazing piece of Japanese animation that is already classed as a cult classic.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
0823095223|5.0|Finally a modern book on the technical aspects of going from figurative sculpt using contemporary resins, rubbers and methods. The book primarily focuses on comic book styled characters, but the technical tips and instructions cover all the basics with alternatives to many materials, and testimonies, and recommendations which are applicable to all aspects of sculpting including prototype design. Excellent book highly recommend.
B0000029J5|5.0|This is probably one of Keb's best albums. It has his usual Robert Johnson influenced playing and great vocals. This album has some great blues and is very laid back.

A great place to start if your new to Keb Mo, or even if you're new to blues.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B001GOVW4M|5.0|This text will, admittedly, be challenging to use IF your proficiency in Japanese has yet to have reached the point to where you can fully digest the material within its pages properly.  If it is sufficient, however, you will NOT find a more comprehensive and useful text on the U.S. market for beginning about the challenging process of acquiring a strong understanding of &#34;advanced&#34; Japanese grammar.  I purchased my copy when it first hit the shelves in Japan and still reference it today.  It is a fantastically well-done work of scholarship!<br /><br />I do not make this assertion lightly.  I have taken and passed Grade 1 (1 kyuu) of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test and enjoyed the great blessing of having had been able to have had trained in Japanese (the school's first language) at the Defense Language Institute in beautiful Monterey, California, (Where I, incidentally, earned my first degree and became a DOD-certified Japanese linguist).<br /><br />Please remember. . . Japanese is not like Spanish or French.  It takes a VERY considerable investment of time, effort, and personal treasure (or, if you live a charmed life, that of your sponsor) to acquire a functional proficiency in it--still more, for a working proficiency.  Don't rush it.  Just as you have to go through the basics in mathematics before graduating into algebra and beyond, so too, must you in your language studies (all the more, if that language happens to be Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Pashto, or Chinese!).  If you try to hit the highway too soon, you will likely wipe yourself out.  (You could become discouraged or, worse still, get into the habit of speaking atrociously bad Japanese, because you haven't properly mastered the basics yet.)
B004CURZFC|3.0|The visuals were great.  The story was not.  Don't get me wrong, the screenwriter(s) tried to put a good story together.  They had all of the ingredients but it never came together for me.  Another in the long-line of great special effects and lack-luster story.
B0042EJD8A|3.0|This film would have been much more realistic if they would have stuck to the facts, instead of trying to lay the blame on Bush and Cheney.  Too much of a liberal biased slant, like it was made and directed by Michael Moore.  Otherwise would have been a good storyline.
B00000IREA|4.0|Though I've had a hard time with Jane's politics since the early 70's; she did make quite a number of fun, lightweight movies in the 60's.  This was capped by her escapades as Barbarella.  After she made this movie the fun was mostly gone and Jane got serious on us.  I liked this movie well-enough at the time of the initial release that I bought the soundtrack which I still believe to be a masterpiece of excess.  It may take a special mood or taste in movies to appreciate \\"Barbarella\\"  today the way we did back in the days of reefer madness but it is really, really different than anything your likely to see in 2011.
B002ZG976U|5.0|BURLESQUE, written and directed by Steve Antin, is a terrific cinematic definition of what the word 'burlesque' means: 'a literary, dramatic or musical work intended to cause laughter by caricaturing the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects. The word derives from the Italian burlesco, which itself derives from the Italian burla - a joke, ridicule or mockery.'  This is a riot of color and good fun and snazzy production numbers a la Bob Fosse takeoffs. The story is predictable and silly and the script borders on mediocre, but with the talent and pizzazz of the cast, none of that matters!<br /><br />Ali (Christine Aguilera) flees Iowa in hopes of a career in show biz and happens into a Sunset Strip Burlesque House run by 'still not down' Tess (Cher) who knows her business is failing, despite the solid help from her gay assistant Sean (Stanley Tucci) and the warnings of her ex-husband/partner Vince (Peter Gallagher).  Tess has problems with some of her lip-synching cast, namely Nikki (Kristen Bell), and is being hounded to sell her club to the wealthy boyfriend of Nikki - Marcus (Eric Dane).  Ali observes, wants to be in the show, but is offered the job of waitress in the club by bartender/songwriter Jack (Cam Gigandet), a guy so kind that he shares his little flat with her.  Ali is persistent and when given a chance to audition she gets into the cast. Her trump card is that she is such a terrific singer that she converts the club away from lip-synching into a full-blown song and dance place.  Romance of course flutters in as do other little sidebars (including a strange quickie by doorman Alexis (Alan Cumming), but the main attractions are the glitzy stage numbers by a surprisingly fine Aguilera and by Cher herself.  It is all very corny and very wonderful entertainment.  Definitely worth an evening's pleasure.  Grady Harp, March 11

B0041KKYDI|5.0|Films such as 127 HOURS come along all too rarely.  Based on a true story, the memoir by Aron Ralston 'Between a Rock and a Hard Place',  and prepared for the screen by Simon Beaufoy and writer/director Danny Boyle, this film is a paean to the indomitable spirit of man.  Basically a one man drama - Aron Ralston (James Franco) - the writers and director have managed to transfer enough outside of the story energy to keep the film in motion at all times.<br /><br />The story is well-known: Aron Ralston (Franco) set out for one of his freewheeling adventures in April 2003 in the canyons of Utah, befriends two girls (Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn) in hiking distress, and proceeds on his hike only to fall into a crevice with a heavy rock crushing his right hand.  The story is about the 127 hours Ralston endures and ultimately survives by excising his own partial right extremity, thus limiting all his efforts to the use of his left hand, freeing himself until he can return home to his parents (Kate Burton and Treat Williams) and his girlfriend (Cl&eacute;mence Po&eacute;sy).  The magic in the film is how immersed Franco is in this role, keeping our attention and compassion through his on-videocamera jokes and pathos.  How he survives is a wonder of nature, of ingenuity, and faith,  and that is what sets the film apart as being so special.  Grady Harp, March 11
B0000AM6IY|1.0|I love this movie. It deserved its Oscars.  But buyers should know that the description \\"full screen edition\\" does NOT mean you see the entire scene as you would in letterbox format.  Indeed, this dvd has been edited so poorly that much of the scene is invisible.  You never really get to see anything on either side of the middle.  It really ruined the great dance scenes, especially.  I would recommend people not buy this version because of the terrible editing.  Try to find a letterbox version, and enjoy this great musical!  The 1 star is because of the terrible editing of this particular dvd..  The movie itself would definitely get 5 stars.
B0019N8P2W|4.0|Waited for years for this on DVD. Was a little disappointed that the \\"original\\" music had to be replaced, but got over it quickly after re-living the funniest moments with some of the best animated characters ever to hit pop-culture! Overall DVDs were in good condition; every so often, they get \\"stuck\\", but usually get going again--probably nothing a good cleaning won't fix.<br /><br />For the price, well worth it!
B0045EJY90|4.0|Even though I'm sure that this item is a good product, the title and description are a little misleading. \\"TEAC CD-P650 CD and USB Recorder with Remote (Black)\\" implies that you can record Audio CDs with this recorder (WAV files). Instead, it only records MP3 files onto CD. So I'm closing the box and replacing it with the TEAC CD-RW890 CD Recorder with Remote (Black). This time, I went to the TEAC website, downloaded and read the manual before I ordered. The title probably should have read \\"TEAC CD-P650 USB and CD MP3 Recorder with Remote (Black)\\".<br />LATER: I bought the CD-RW890 CD Recorder and it is a great product (too). I needed it for Audio CD recording.<br />Three years later: the CD-RW890 is still working OK. Used often. Several hundred CD Master recordings.
0743277708|5.0|Richard Adams' Watership Down is a literary cornerstone that will last for ages for its whimsical and undying depth.  What a phenomenal read. It contains epic storytelling, substance, and gratifying character development.  The reader will be astounded with the way the characters and scenery are interwoven to create such a vivid and masterful scene of intrigue and substance.  Numerous themes such as nature, heroism, strength, honor, failure, unity, harmony, etc can be extracted from the novel.  In essence, the number of themes one can draw out from reading from this book are endless, thus showing what a remarkable piece of literature Adams has constructed.      Rabbits represent much more than the conventional, cute and cuddly critter that we are all use to. They are mere humans in this complex story of survival and upward mobility in this fulfilling and charismatic journey to utopia. Despite being a fairly long read, it actually is suspenseful and offers a phenomenal glimpse into the rabbits' culture in terms of mythology, which is quite moving.  If you own a pet rabbit like myself (mini-lop that is 5 years old) then you will most likely enjoy this book. However, if you do not own a rabbit, I am sure you will enjoy it for its lively narrative and storytelling that is sure to leave a lasting impression in you heart.
0711225176|4.0|This book has a nice quantity of Mucha images, but most of them are rather small, without close-ups for details. Also, though the book provides some nice information about this history of some of the works, I'm looking for a book that includes more information about the processes Mucha used as well as the symbolism featured in the works. Alas, my search continues. However, I do think this is a valuable addition to any Mucha lover's library. The amount and variety of works included is quite nice.
B004047XXO|2.0|This is not true 3D production, but 5 cent red green \\"glasses\\" that supposed to give the illusion of 3D, and does so poorly when comparing to true 3D movies.  Don't pay the premium for this product, just buy the regular 2D if you want to watch the movie.
B003EYVXUU|4.0|I'd say that if you've seen the Swedish original, there isn't a great deal to be gained by watching this remake, though the two movies do complement each other emotionally, at times. Watching this after seeing \\"Let the Right One In\\" is a bit like watching \\"Vanilla Sky\\" after \\"Abre los Ojos\\". Both are good films but lack the freshness of the originals. In its own right, I would recommend seeing \\"Let Me In\\". The special effects were not quite as improved as I thought they may have been, especially in comparison with the Two Face effects in The Dark Knight Returns, but they hold up well.<br /><br />I found the scenes concerned with bullying more convincing in \\"Let Me In\\" than they were in \\"Let the Right One In\\", so that's something in the remake's favour.<br /><br />Overall, if you haven't seen it before and haven't seen the swedish original, I recommend \\"Let Me In\\". There haven't been any other vampire movies released lately, and those two certainly stand out within the genre and beyond it.
1439102724|1.0|I cannot believe I waited a year for this book, preordered it, read it in a day and had to wait 3 days to review it because I did not know what to write. I felt cheated by this storyline and its characters.  This book is not up to the standards I expect from Jodi Picoult.<br /><br />Why? Because I could not believe Jodi Picoult could turn out such one dimensional, flat, stereotypical characters in a flimsy, uninteresting storyline.  Where is the author of \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" or \\"Plain Truth\\"?  Yes, those were controversial storylines and characters, but they packed a punch. Perhaps it is just too predictable when reading a Picoult book?  Granted, she has a bestseller formula (as I am sure she will this time)but it is still formula writing. The POV told from 3 to 4 primary characters' chapters,(throw in a couple of interesting minor characters such as the attorney and Zoe's mother), wrap it around combustive subject matter, add a trial and end with a two page epilogue that ties everything up with a bow.<br /><br />  *************Spoilers*************<br />I expect a well researched subject from Jodi, but not direct quotes from medical journals. The sensitive, emotionally turbulent subject of infertility was only lightly explored. In reality, would someone deeply involved with fertility issues be so blase about any physical trauma at 28 weeks, when the baby is borderline viable?  Zoe's stillborn son resulted in Max abruptly leaving her without much insight. Zoe and Vanessa's relationship jumps quickly to the altar. Did Vanessa even want to be a mother before Zoe?  Did Zoe subconsciously pick someone who could carry her embryos to term with Vanessa being easily available?  Was Max really that quickly swayed to pick his brother, Reid, and wife, Liddy to be the parents?  It was not until Max and Liddy had a hot encounter in the kitchen that Max ever doubted his uncle role in his biological child's life.  The Max/Liddy sudden love was contrived.  The ultra right-wing, publicity-seeking lawyers/religious leaders were easy pickings as the 'Bad Guys'. Unbelievably, I found the multi-dimensional aspects surrounding infertility, lesbian relationships and Right Wing Religion to be extremely predictable and boring.<br />  ************End of Spoilers**********<br /><br />I believe Jodi's ultimate message is \\"families come in many shapes and sizes that cannot be determined by shared DNA alone\\". I most heartily agree with that sentiment and practice it in my private life.  It is just a shame Jodi Picoult turned it into this boring book.<br /><br />I have purchased all of her books in the past, it is just future purchases that I will avoid.ity-seeking lawyers/religious leaders were easy pickings as the 'Bad Guys'.

B003KGBIRK|5.0|I continue to enjoy this movie, which remains relevant even though it was made in a time prior to widespread use of the internet and digital media such as CD, DVD, etc. Cronenberg explores a wide range of issues and combines intellect with imagination to create something special, from the philosophies of Prof. Brian O'Blivion to Max Renn's concerns about his exposure to a satellite TV station that seems to transmit nothing but snuff movies.     Certain lines of dialogue, or in O'Blivion's case, monologue (\\"That's my television name. Soon, all of us will have special names -- names designed to cause the cathode ray tube to resonate...\\" or \\"It's just torture and murder. No plot, no characters. Very, very realistic. I think it's what's next.\\") are strikingly prescient. Rick Baker's special effects are great. Overall, the movie is unsettling, complex, and stands as an exemplar of David Cronenberg's best work. It does leave me intrigued as to how this film might have been had it been made in the present day.    I recommend this movie. It is complex, but viewers of Videodrome are supported by the material to a greater degree than is the case with many of David Lynch's movies. Picture quality is better than I've seen on the previous DVD edition of the movie. I suspect this blu-ray has reached the upper limit for the source material. Having said this, the extremely poor movie \\"Transformers 2\\" does have superior picture clarity, if that's your thing.

1439153663|1.0|I am shocked by the  number of people who have given this book 5, 4, even 3 stars.

B0000027I6|5.0|This album is one of ten I would bring with me if I had to be stranded on a desert island.  Some of the lyrics have become emblazoned in my brain and I find I recite them to myself like a mantra.  Subject matter was relevant when it first came out and seems even more so now, which is scary considering our ultimate demise is outlined quite nicely in the last song \\"Amused to Death\\".  I didn't know who Bill Hubbard was until I started listening to the live version of \\"Amused to Death\\" on the album \\"In the Flesh\\". His story is described so sadly by Razz, the gentleman who recalls his death and his feelings about leaving him in \\"No Man's Land\\" so long ago in WW1.  It is so fitting to start the album with Razz's narration, and even more so at the end of the album.  Sometimes it brings me to tears.  Thank you, Roger, for writing lyrics and music that will always make me think.  In today's world it is a pleasure to be confronted by music that requires one to actually pay attention.  I have to get headphones to really experience \\"Amused to Death\\"!!
B000002JSV|5.0|AC/DC Powerage is the most solid album the band has ever made, bar none. This is the hard rock album to end all hard rock albums. I've been a fan of AC/DC since middle school. I'm now 31 years old and own every single album in the band's catalog. But this album to me has always been the stand out album for AC/DC, and coming from a Brian fan over Bon, that's saying a lot. You can put this C.D. in your player, press play and just let the hard rock journey begin. Every single track just flows with idiot simple and extremely catchy guitar hooks that will leave any rock and roll guitar picker scratching their head thinking, \\"Why didn't I think of that riff\\"? This is a \\"roll your windows down in your car in 70 degree weather on a spring day while your heading down the highway by yourself\\" kind of album. It's a \\"hard rock feel good album with balls\\". Powerage will appeal to anyone who likes classic hard rock music, whether an avid AC/DC fan or just a modest fan, it will be difficult for anyone to say they don't like this album. It's too catchy not to like. So if your a new AC/DC fan and you want to tread the waters a little deeper beyond the realm of Back in Black and Highway to Hell, MAKE SURE Powerage is your next stop. But be warned....you may need a neck brace for this one!  - B. A. Redd
0756404738|5.0|WMF was a fantastic follow up to TNOTW.  I definitely lost sleep over this one; I just could not put it down!  Rothfuss is amazing.  The world feels so incredibly vast, the characters are well-developed, and the story is well-paced and exciting.  I love the \\"Arabian Nights\\" feel of stories within stories within stories...    Kvothe is a very likable character.  The framework of his story is familiar, but this is not simply a tale of a clever orphan boy who defies the odds to become a powerful wizard.  Rothfuss is able to take so many stories that we are familiar with and spin them into something new and imaginative.  I look forward to seeing how it all concludes.
B0002YJ29O|5.0|I bought this dvd in 12/06 and thought back then the DTS track was the best recorded music I had heard so far in my life.<br />The sound stage is 150 degrees wide, the applause is from the sides and it trully gives you the impression of being there. The pieces with 8 pianos placed in the form of an isosceles trapezoid let you hear every single piano in it's virtual spot in front of you. Just outstandingly recorded. There are half a dozen people credited for the sound.<br />Even today I use this dvd probably as the 3rd to showcase the sound in my music room, right after Mahlers 9th with the Mahler Youth Orchestra (which is in a class by itself) and the blu ray The Barber of Seville with Florez/Bayo by the Madrid Opera.<br />What a bargain.<br /><br />Edit 8/27/15: Even today it is still top notch and remains in my Top Ten surround recordings.

B000KBGQYI|5.0|Jane Eyre has been one of my most favorite books ever since I was a little girl.  It was such a pleasure to watch the entire story come to life over 11 episodes.  (Yes, the episodes are mis-labled...the entire story is here in the first season).  The sets and costumes are as I would expect.  The acting is transparent--it is as though I were there, watching the story unfold.
0756404738|3.0|I really liked 'Name of the Wind' (like, I guess, most people reviewing this book so soon after publication).     Is this as good? No. Rothfuss is a fine writer so this is still pretty damn readable, and it's even more epic and sprawling than the first so you can disappear into his world for even longer. But it's nowhere near as tight as the first novel. 'Name of the Wind' felt meticulously planned, with every incidental little detail part of the wider story. In \\"Wise Man's Fear\\" there's a LOT of detail, a huge chunk of which seems meaningless.     Early in the book the main character constructs an elaborate device which protects him from arrows and crossbow bolts. We learn exactly how this works in great detail - and then never hear about it again. We meet a mysterious librarian, who then vanishes from the book. Later a malevolent Arcanist attempts to assassinate a powerful noble, is foiled and then disappears until the end of the book when we're told he's been killed by someone else. We never find out why he tried to murder the noble. The book is filled with odd little dead ends: the hero decides to flee from a school where he's held semi-prisoner, organises his escape, explains various complicated details of his plan and then decides not to escape.     What makes this even more frustrating are the parts of the story that scream for more detail. The hero meets the most dangerous, evil creature in all of existence - he randomly stumbles upon it while out for a walk - and the book implies that this is the most significant event in his entire life. That gets about two pages. Just for comparison, searching through the woods for some bandits gets about two hundred pages.     Like I said, Rothfuss is a good writer. So the hundred-page digressions are entertaining and fun to read - but it is basically just a shaggy dog story, which is disappointing since \\"Name of the Wind\\" delivered so much more.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Some movies win best picture and I scratch my head wondering why.  The moment this movie ended, my girlfriend looked at me and said \\"Academy Award for best picture and best actor\\".  Firth would've won the best actor award in almost any year; his performance was that compelling.  This is the way movies used to be, no gratuitous violence, sex or special effect.  The R rating that this movie was tagged with is a joke.  One of the techniques that the Geoffrey Rush character used was to have the king curse to release him from the emotional shackles of his stuttering.  It's a part of the story and totally appropriate.  That an intelligent 12 or 13 year old kid isn't allowed to see the movie in theaters is ridiculous.  Does anyone seriously believe that they've never heard those words before?    Hugely recommended movie and destined to be looked back upon as one of the great films.

Following his death came a number of releases from producer Rick Rubin.  I approached this one with some caution as Johnny has been known to fall into sentimentality. Well in this case, forget that idea!  I played this CD through twice straight off, something I hardly ever do.  While the strenght of his voice is clearly on the wane, there's no questioning his honesty, humility and integrity.  Apart from the lighter moments of If You Could Read My Mind and Rose Of My Heart, it's mostly about human weakness and dying. Coupled with those themes is a searching and reaching out in faith to God for peace and some understanding of why we live and die.  If you want to be entertained, look elsewhere, if you want to hear Johnny bear his soul and more, this could be for you.
B003LZ5B7S|4.0|Rose was a fantastic companion to the doctor, by far my favorite. You must see series from this point on.

0061537969|3.0|Read this book in one go. I appreciated the freshness of having the perspective of a dog. I found myself smiling and almost tearing at one point or another. The depiction of Denny should have been the strongest, this is his dog! Of course Denny can do no wrong. All that being said, the book was just okay. Good for a once through, but not a repeat read.
1406323926|1.0|well..i could have bought the plain book and was extremely disappointed that the disk was unusable in the US... unless maybe on a computer, i dont know...i felt like it didnt state that point very clearly on the the description... BUt i didint want to go through the aggravation of returning it so i gave it to cousins who like in the UK for their kids.   the books looked so nice and the pictures were darling so i was pretty sad about this purchase in the end
1439102813|5.0|The depiction of Alice Howard's early-onset Alzheimer's is very realistic and Alice herself very memorable. I love the first-person viewpoint and can't really see Alice's story being told from any other viewpoint. The novel is beautifully crafted and the storyline very powerful. Highly Recommended!
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Enjoyed the movie and thought it would be great to add to my son's growing collection (he's only two so maybe OUR growing collection) of DVDs.  Love the digital copy since I can save it to iTunes and we can watch it on the laptop at any time.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I've owned my Sony \\"verticles\\" for a few years, now, and they are extremely fine earphones.  They are light-weight, fit comfortably into the ear, like ear buds, but the headband keeps them securely on your head and in your ears.  The design of the \\"buds\\" is such that you get mellow sound - nothing \\"tinny\\" about it.  They seem to be built to last forever.<br /><br />That much said, I have only one problem with them - I recently got a new MP3 player, plugged the Sony's into it, and nearly ruptured my eardrums with the loudness of the sound I was getting.  I checked the player, and the sound level was at \\"1,\\" and when I turned the sound to \\"0\\" (mute), there was no sound at all.  Just to make sure the player wasn't malfunctioning, I tried the standard \\"cheapie\\" buds the player came with, and volume levels were fine.  Tried another set of buds (from my Apple Shuffle), and they worked fine.  The best I can figure is that the acoustic design of the Sony Vertical buds is so perfect that there is no sound loss whatsoever.<br /><br />If you want to listen to your MP3's where the ambient noise is loud (a gym, or fitness center with lots of activities and motorized devices going on), there is nothing that will give you anything even close to the sound you'll get from the Sony Ultra Lighweight MDR-W08L Vertical In-The-Ear Headphones.  (I still use them when I work out at on a treadmill, or when there are several people working out.)<br /><br />But if you want to listen to quiet music (while reading in a library or your living room at night), try something else.  These just won't work if you want background sound and nothing more.
B000P0J09M|5.0|Just watched this on AMC the other day on a small old 27\\" and after maybe 20 times, STILL I rate this film as phenomenal in script, acting, directing, set design, etc. Typically one can find inconsistencies and other issues after many viewings, but this one stands the test of time. Was surprised I watched in entirety without a single negative comment and that is a rare moment in my film viewing history.  True roller coaster ride, wide-eyed captivating drama based on a true story. Highly recommend and if O'Henry sobers up, anticipate a franchise extension with Part Deux and his painting career, divorce, kids, and life on the left coast!
B000LJAEFG|5.0|Loved this movie.  Saw it years ago and what is ironic about it is that I have a personal connection with filming location.  I was the Director of Contract Security at that building. I still remember the building the uniqueness and the people I worked for.  Maureen and Mike...
1933308087|5.0|This is a very complete and extensive reference and training book for using and creating traditional patchwork blocks. It is not a quilt design book, although there are around a dozen illustrations of quilts that she has designed (these are all very elegant, some very unique). The book is about drafting patchwork blocks and the ways that recoloring and redrawing existing blocks can change them. There is an entire chapter about how the blocks are organized by the grids and templates that are used to create them. This is supplemented by grids printed on transparent material that can be used to identify what kind of grid a particular block is created with (you superimpose the grids over a given block until you find the one that fits). There are multiple methods given for recreating block designs if you do not have a computer with some built-in grids and for drawing various grid shapes (drawing a hexagon block takes some training). Every block has a line drawing that accompanies it at the bottom of the page. She also has a chapter on design ideas, including designing in black, white and gray to establish the values needed to produce the block, using mirrors to see how square designs will look when made from a particular fabric, designing two block quilts, fragmenting, using value when selecting fabrics, creating tessellations and how to use border prints for blocks and sashing. This is a particularly helpful feature of the book.<br /><br />The blocks are drawn from many pre-1970 sources and the documentation for each block and its variations is substantial. She includes some of the blocks that she designed for the Hilton Head seminars she used to give. These very interesting blocks will be useful to those using cube designs in their one block wonder fabrics and those creating quilts that have a more contemporary look, among others. All of the blocks are presented with the very elegant fabrics she has designed that are available on her website. If I can characterize the overall look of the completed blocks, I would say that it tends towards antique, baroque or gothic, reminding me of the mosaic floors that one sees in European cathedrals and palaces. The quilts are luminous, for the most part.<br /><br />She states in the beginning of the book that she now uses a computer program to design her blocks and quilts. The grid tools that she presents are very helpful for users of quilting software as well as those using traditional drafting tools. She designed some of the grids herself and these are very helpful in drafting complex shapes like hexagons. My own use of my computer quilting software has taken a huge leap as I have started using the tools presented in this book.<br /><br />Highly recommended for quilters using traditional blocks who are serious about developing their craft.look of the completed blocks, I would say that it tends towards antique, baroque or gothic, reminding me of the mosaic floors that one sees in European cathedrals and palaces.

B004MMEIK0|5.0|This book actually made me laugh out loud during parts, only to put me on the edge of my seats during other parts.  It has hot moments, action moments, and sad moments.  My biggest complaint with this book is the repeated use of the phrase \\"God's Blood\\" throughout the entire book.  It is irritating, but if you can get past it, this is a really fun and entertaining book.
1594202842|1.0|A little amazed that so many non-Asians would embrace this as a rosy story with high praises for being a super mom.  Deep down under the cover, it is a family portrait that is rather more self-serving and pretentious than TLC that any normal mother would know better to provide to their children.  Anyone who'd lived his/her life under some dysfunctional family setting may find it more inspiring...  If you can peel off the first layer of the onion, then no doubt, you can see how much it is the same for the next few layers to its core: eloquently written to mask writer's childhoods. It is so obvious how much of that past is projected onto her children. No wonder more critics are from Psychiatric fields. Luckily, this review is strictly from an Asian's perspective with more than 30+ yrs experience living through both cultures; had to admit 3/4 of that was educated by American.    Let's be real.   Yes, Asian parents (Chinese, Indian, Korean, Malaysian...etc) whether they are well to-do or not, would often instill in their children the value of education. Through that, it is a stepping stone through life. For non-Asian, it is the same, if not more, to ensure their children can grow up normally, in a healthy environment. So age-old history--who can be better than whom. This \\"Tiger Mom\\" tries a little too hard to pitch a radical parenting approach without fully understand latter consequences. It is so far-fetched from Asian traditions.   If she had interview with Dr. Phil first, instead with NPR, CNN and wherever else, then it is probably a good book to read.     Asian doctors, lawyers, bio-scientists, engineers, musicians--most must have a Tiger Mom?! Oh, puh...llease.    Touting \\"Tiger Mom\\" as a true parenting model that \\"Westerners\\" should emulate, is so weird, so out of touch. Children under such circumstances will only perpetuating the same ugly cycle that Author'd gone through during her childhood. Wouldn't be a surprise one day these children rewrite the history of how they had been scarred and survived this Tiger's vicious claws. And Media then again will have a field day!!    To think that \\"Tiger Mom\\" Asian parenting style has some value to gain, it is so sad.     Please save your hard earn money and get something more entertaining for a cozy, Winter reading. May I recommend: Amy Tan's \\"The Hundred Secret Senses: A Novel.\\" Make sure it is in Kindle.
B003SI6C4O|4.0|This is the first movie that I have streamed on my laptop from Amazon and the first movie I've rented from Amazon.  It streamed with no glitches, good video and strong sound.  The purchase was quick and it began streaming immediately.<br /><br />The movie was fun and interesting to watch.  Denzel was great.  Paula Patton was too.  And I've had a soft spot for Val Kilmer since Top Gun although the only other thing he's ever done (that I've seen) that is worth noting is Tombstone (in which he was brilliant.) This movie is worth the rental price even for someone like me who cancelled my satellite subscription because paying for TV is kind of wasteful.<br /><br />Once football season is over, who needs live TV?  I would rather pay for the occasional movie to stream and for some Netflix DVD rentals.  Then I can watch what I want when I have the time instead having full-time cable TV.  Even if I rent TV shows and movies galore I will be hard pressed to spend the same amount I spent on my satellite TV bill each month.<br /><br />For others who are somewhat new to this streaming thing, I can tell you that I tried renting from Amazon today in hopes that I can have multiple options for my new entertainment way of life. I don't want to be bound to iTunes, Netflix, Hulu or any single source exclusively.  Now, off I go to look for something else to stream from Amazon.  Maybe I'll check one of the movies that's free w/ my Prime membership.<br /><br />By the way, the prices here are comparable to iTunes but the 48-hr rental period is preferable by far.  I love watching movies from my iPad but the 24-hour limit on iTunes stinks so I'm look for an alternative!  I rarely watch a movie in one sitting.  Now, I hope Amazon gets to the point where I can download a movie rental so I can watch something I rented while I'm on an airplane or stuck somewhere else with time on my hands but no high-speed internet connection.  (Dear Amazon, you do that and you'll take getting some of the dollarsI regularly send to Apple Inc.)
1435248244|4.0|I am a seventh grade student and have read this book two times. I also read the rest of the series, the same as my sisters. We all loved these books, but furthermore, we all agreed on one other thing. Uglies is the best book in this series. Here is a little summary.  Uglies is about a 15 year old girl, Tally, who lives in a world where once you turn 16, you turn pretty. When you become pretty, you can party all day and night and almost do anything you want. Tally has been very enthusiastic about turning pretty and she has been waiting all her life for the day she turns 16. Soon almost everyone her age has gone to New Pretty Town, right across the river, yet so far away, and Tally is nearly the only one left waiting to become what she has always wanted to be. Before long, she meets Shay, a girl the same age as her, to the day. They become fast friends, teaching each other new tricks and waiting to become pretty together. But before they turn into the party-all-day-all-night people new pretties are, Shay seems to be having doubts about what Tally has been planning for since she knew she was ugly. When Shay disappears, leaving Tally a coded message of how to find her, the Special Circumstances agents, dangerously beautiful inhabitants that mysteriously run her city, take Tally and tell her to find the hideout Shay has run away to. Or else... she'll never be pretty.   This book is amazing, using superb word choice to express what the characters are feeling, and a wonderfully inventive idea of hoverstruts, talking bridges, and bungee jackets that catch you a split second before you hit the ground to create a world that could very well be ours soon. Although the first sentence in the book, \\"The early summer sky was the color of cat vomit,\\" may repulse some readers, it is actually a great simile that clearly shows how Tally is feeling. If anything else, the rest of the book makes up for it completely. Some parts of the book are a little confusing with their complexity, but as you read on you discover what they meant. Symbolism is a big part in this story, from the beautiful flowers taking over, to the whole book showing that people need to fight for diversity, which is falling away in their own world. Scott Westerfeld portrays Tally and Shay in a way that can almost make you see them in front of you, and everything is described so perfectly that you feel as if you were there, secreting your way to New Pretty Town alongside Tally. The plot twists and turns like a roller coaster, and when something surprising happens, you feel as if the monstrous metal frame has just fallen out from under you and you are gliding out into thin air until that trusty, just about unbreakable track is supporting you again.   Overall, this book is breathtaking in how it is written and is great choice for readers who love fiction. Younger readers might become a tad confused with the words, but when they are a bit older, they will understand it perfectly. It's a great read you won't put down till you are done flipping those pages. Even then, you'll want to pick it right up again and start from the beginning!

B004DCB62M|3.0|I am a new Kindle user . . .  I have THIS version of the Sherlock Holmes stories, as well as the other version with the EXACT SAME NAME and COVER. I would give this version a 5 star rating if it navigated more easily!    (The OTHER version was:   ASIN  B0013XW2F4 for $1.99)    THIS version is much better because it contains all the illustrations by Sidney Paget!  :-)  However this version is also much more difficult to navigate . . . it is much harder to go to any individual story.    One of the things about the Sherlock Holmes culture is that you need to be able to quickly navigate between individual stories! Any diehard Sherlockian will verify this.    A way around this is to \\"highlight\\" any particular story's title as you find your way through this e-book.  Then, you can \\"View my Notes and Marks\\", and thus find your way to any story quickly and immediately. This is a very important point.    I really love all the Sherlock Holmes stories, and I have both the \\"Baring-Gould\\"  and the \\"Klinger\\" Annotated printed hardcopy books as well as many other printed books . . . so I know what I am talking about here.    The Amazon Kindle is one of the best inventions of this century!     But, a major problem seems to be in deciding WHICH e-book to buy out of any particular series with the SAME NAME AND TITLE, and which one will work the best with your Kindle. You can't tell exactly what you're getting until it's delivered to your device.    I wish Amazon would help this by providing a little more detail in their Kindle book descriptions, perhaps showing the TOC for the book, etc.    Thanks and all best,  Joe
006112429X|4.0|This book was really good and had such a sad, shockingly unexpected twist at the end. The book is in letter format from Eva to her husband Franklin. They are the parents of a 15-year-old who murders 7 of his classmates in the school gymnasium in a very original, well thought out, and brutal fashion. It started out a little slow with Eva going over some of their marriage before they had Kevin and their decision to even have a child. Things go badly from the moment Kevin was born. He immediately seemed to develop a hatred of his mother from birth which his father seemed to dismiss because Kevin would act completely different when his father was around. Throughout the story, Eva seems to be the only one who sees Kevin as the evil and manipulative infant, child, and teen he becomes. Kevin seems to obtain pleasure in the mental torture and abuse he inflicts on his mother. His father fails to see any of this and accuses Eva of creating the stories of the horrific things Kevin has done, making excuses for him, or believing Kevin's lies. But Eva sees the dangerous, evil, look of no remorse in his eyes. Of all those who have came into contact with Kevin, Franklin seems to be unaware of, or in denial of, how calculating his son actually is. And the murder of his classmates is only one of many hideous and unthinkable events caused by Kevin throughout his 15 years. It was a great look at the outcome of tragedy through the eyes of the mother of a murderous boy. A great read!
B004EJ14V2|5.0|This movie was such a great surprise! I'd read the good reviews and wasn't disappointed! The lead actress is great (as is the cast) the humor is smart, the story is timeless, and the music and pop culture references spot on. This is the kind of movie that hollywood no longer tends to make - well written teen comedies that appeal to adults and don't reach for gross jokes to make a point.
B002RI97O8|1.0|I read this book when I was in the third grade, and I have loved it ever since. I never purchased the book until now and forgot quite how short it was, so I had no problem paying the $8.50 - but this book took me literally 15 minutes to read (I think the original was only like 30 or 50 pages, and includes pictures). The content I would rate 5 stars, because it is an adorable, whimsical tale of a family of foxes outsmarting three nefarious farmers (wow, a little alliteration there?). However, if my 1 star helps someone else notice that the price is ridiculous, one star it is.<br /><br />Also be advised that the other 1-star reviews are ridiculous. Read to your children. Allow them to read. Encourage them to read. Don't censor 'scary' or 'offensive' content (within reason, of course - don't show a 2 year old 'Friday the Thirteenth'). If you allow them to be scared and help them rationalize their fears instead of shielding them all the time, they will be much more well-adjusted.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|One of the best kid movies ever made. It teaches kids about disapline & how to deal with being bullied!  I recommend every one to buy this movie!

0316098337|4.0|It was a very good story but I still have some mixed feelings about it. I think the thing that bothered me the most was that it was written from the child's view. And the language he uses just really irritated me sometimes. It's probably just me, but there were several times I kept thinking that someone needs to put their foot down with this kid. But that was really the only part I had trouble with. It was a very sad story of a 19-year-old girl being kidnapped and held in a fortified shed for seven long years and the things she endured before and after giving birth all alone and trying to create a life for her son within four walls. After their daring escape, Jack goes on to detail how he is affected by a world he never knew about on the outside and the problems this causes for his mother and himself. A really good story if you can get past or not be bothered by the narration of a 5-year old.
B000EHSVOG|5.0|This is an amazingly made movie for the time it was made.  It is exciting and for the disaster genre one of the better ones.
B000002JSN|3.0|I feel guilty only giving this album a 3 star rating. Led Zeppelin brought back a lot of songs from the past and threw them on this album so their were average song they just used as fillers. The first disc is easily a 5 star but I think they could have cut some songs out and just made it a single album. But I guess it never hurts to have more Zep even if it is just their average songs.
0689865384|4.0|2/27/11            Who should read Uglies by Scott Westerfeld? Every middle schooler who wants to learn about bias in the world and how it relates to themselves. This book was assigned to my 7th grade Honors English class. Uglies  is a futuristic, science fiction novel geared to teens to help them establish a good self image. This story has adult themes, but is written on a level that is appropriate for tweens to understand.       Tally, the main character, has always dreamed on becoming a Pretty, but then she meets Shay. They plan on getting the operation, to make them pretty, together until Shay runs away like others have done. Tally is sent by the Pretty operation team, the Specials, to track down where Shay and the rest of the runaways are.       This book has it all, drama, adventures, love, and a nice moral. Not only does Uglies teach a lesson about beauty's price, but also includes a thrilling story line that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Now, I don't read HUNDREDS of books, but this one made me want to read more. I would recommend this book for kids 12 and up since there is some content that may be inappropriate for youngsters.     So what are you waiting for?
B0018PH3L0|5.0|Robert Duvall is one of my favorite actors and this movie is by far his best (my opinion) and in Commanche Moon (prequel) they couldn't have picked a better actor than Steve Zahn (he's another one of my favorites) to play Duvall's part. However, I wasn't too crazy about Return to Lonesome Dove. John Voight didn't do justice to Tommy Lee's part.
B0045U9WPU|5.0|Delirium is a compulsively readable novel where the world is \\"Logan's Run\\" meets the Nazis. It was a complex and fascinating look into a world where people merely exist and play the roles laid out for them by the society they live in. There is no crime and divorce, but there is also no passion or love. Love is seen as a disease that must be cured, and emotional joy in life must be suppressed. Each chapter began with a rewritten proverb, principle, or rules about their society that fit that belief system. Even the story of original sin in the garden of Eden was rewritten to fit their government's twist on the truth.<br /><br />How would anyone survive a in world without love? Delirium uses a variety of fictional scenarios to take the reader there and give them a taste while entertaining at the same time. In the story people are told what they must think and who they must marry, or they will be exterminated or imprisoned in the crypts for life. The premise of the story is compelling and I instantly connected with the characters and their longings.<br /><br />This is the kind of book that makes you think. Situations in the story were an eerie, yet subtle allusion to what is really happening in the world today. They show how close we are as a society to getting where the people in the book were if we become complacent about our freedoms. Some things in the story were similar to the book 1984, but modernized. I found it fascinating.<br /><br />Delirium skillfully showed how freedom can be restricted or removed under the cloak of protecting the people, when in reality it killed who they were as individuals. People who wanted to keep their emotions would rather die than be stripped of who they were as individuals through the cure, which was a surgical procedure on the brain that short-circuited the part of the brain that felt love. The story made me think of what it would be like to live in a country in the Middle East where you have to be Muslim or you are seen as an infidel and you die. Only this took place in the United States in the future. Kind of scary, but oh so possible.<br /><br />Last, I was drawn into the main character's quest for meaning and for love. I was impressed with how the author planted the love in the Lena's heart by her mother when she raised her children and how she showed that it never left even after her mother was gone and she was only eight. That seed of love in her heart never died, but it was squelched by fear and brainwashing by the government until someone dared to show her that love is not a disease, but in fact it was worth sacrificing everything for. Reminded me of the salvation story and the sacrifice of Jesus, and this isn't even a Christian book.<br /><br />I could not stop reading this story because I was on Lena's journey with her as she discovered the lies she'd been taught since her mother disappeared, and as she learned the truth about love. My heart broke for her and yet there was a bittersweet and beautiful ending to the story that left me wanting more, yet satisfied at the same time. I will definitely be looking for the second book in this series.his took place in the United States in the future. Kind of scary, but oh so possible.

0060751967|4.0|Though I do agree with some of the negative reviews, the heroine can be annoying at times, bold as brass, and overly sarcastic, but I really did identify with her (which may not be the greatest thing, but it is painfully true).    It wasn't \\"Not-put-downable\\", but it was definitely good.     and the use of \\"Gods Blood\\" was overly annoying too,  but the Scotsmen clad in kilts made it exciting.     It wasn't a literary genius at work, but I read to be entertained, and I was. However, I have not read romance novels of this genre before, so I may not be the best judge    But for free on Kindle, I thought it was AWESOME.

Anyway the best song in this album is Thor which is an excellent song and the other songs are average and some good (like Mountains). Its a must for real Manowar fans and lets say a nice album for generally metal fans who might like epic metal bands.
0156027321|5.0|This book is Amazing! First you should know the book is not about math. It is not a quick read but really good if you give it a chance. It is my new favorite book. In fact have never written a review or even thought about writing a review on a book before. This book is not a typical survival story and that is what makes it so great. It has so many intersting and amusing elements. The situational irony of being on a boat with a tiger, the three religions that Pi loves, and endurance and survival of Pi combine to make an intrigueing story. I love this book you should buy it and read it.

B002ZG994U|5.0|When I first sat down to watch the movie The A-Team, I sat with the thought \\"Noooo, it just will never match up to the series\\".  Then the movie began and I was literally blown away!  This movie not only matched the series, but surpassed it!!!!!       The characters in the movie followed very close to the t.v. series, and there was just tons of action to keep you on the edge of your seat!  And I laughed until my sides ached at the antics of the Team. Great movie!  A WOW movie!
B003VANOFY|3.0|I couldn't get the software to install on my Win 7 64 system. I was told it was a corrupt file on my system and I went so far as a complete reinstall of everything and still couldn't get the software to install. It might be for the best though as many have reviewed this item with many Mic issues and so so performance.    I returned the item and can't really give it a good or bad rating but wanted to relay my experience. I have given it a 3 rating for this reason. Logitech support as I have state in other reviews of Logitech products recently is:    \\"Logitech tech support system is pretty good and they get back to you quickly but it always seems like they are grasping at straws and using the customer forum as their answer center.\\"
B0015HOFZI|4.0|For your basic tuntable, it has done well. It was easy to set up and was ready to go in a matter of minutes.  I did have to use an older amp/reciever for the hookups.I perfer using the rca plugs rather than the USB connecter.  This turntable is perfect for first time listeners as well as oldtime users like myself.  The packaging was welldone, I must admit it was well protected.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I never saw Avatar in the theaters...    My wife got me a BluRay player for Christmas this year along with this Avatar extended edition collectors set and Ive never seen the full capability of my HDTV.  The picture is just plain rediculous on this disc.  I threw this movie in the player after most of the family had left on Christmas day and my father-in-law and I stood in the livingroom 3 feet away from the screen in awe at the outstanding picture quality and colors.    Some people say the plot was stupid but I liked the characters and what they had to say.  The acting was great.  I think the extended version is worth seeing and the extra scenes add to the movie.  The special features disc was also very interesting with segments on how they made the movie.  The featurette about James Cameron going on a earth day tour was a little pretentious.    Get this disc as a showoff disc at the very least!
B000002J0B|4.0|Easily my favorite Led Zeppelin album. Zeppelin tries a few different styles in this album and as the great band they are they perform perfectly. I only have good things to say about this album. The songs that I really like are The Rain Song and D'Yer Mak'er, but again I enjoy all of them.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|The energy of this group is incredible!!!  Their voices and harmony are great.  The violinist danced and skipped all over the stage and never missed a beat! Blown away! Remarkable!
B003HARV7A|5.0|When i watch Showgirls, I'm not laughing at the screen or making fun of it, I'm watching it dead serious and am completly enthralled. My favorite scene is when Nomi is dancing on top of the boat at the convention center in her beautiful blue sequin mini. She doesn't realize that's she's really there to go home with some horny asian business men and when she finds out, she's royally pissed!<br />Elizabeth Berkley and Gina Gershon are goddesses!!!!!
B000001FYL|5.0|I had this on Cassette back when it first came out.  I am a big fan of Jon Bon Jovi as a songwriter and he has written alot of catchy and great tunes.  As a soundtrack this is right up there with some of his or dare to say probably best work ever.  If you haven't listened to this give it a try but be forwarned for all you early Bon Jovi fans when he was more Hard Rock this is more bluesy, country than In and out of Lovish....and for a solo album even if it is a soundtrack...some of Jons best work ever...I highly recommend you take a listen as every song tells a story that will intrigue you to listen to more...
0439023491|5.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy is one of the most exciting stories that I've read in a long time.  It's the type of book you just can't put down, it keeps you interested.  Just amazing. You feel for the girl Katniss and everything she has to endure. Having to go into the Arena not once, but twice.  Not knowing whats there, or whom to trust.  It's an emotional roller coaster ride. This is a book for Adults and young teens.
B001TODCII|5.0|The movie Taken is a good movie. Liam Neeson does a great job in it. There is drama, and mystery and action, just about anything for any audience, except children.  I am certainly glad that I bought it. The girl who played his daughter also did a good job. All throughout the movie you want to help him to find his daughter and you do not know how he's going to do it. I do think it is well worth the effort to see this movie.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|A lizard gets lost in the desert and finds his way to a small town, populated by various critters, that is desperate for water. He becomes the Sheriff, and must try to become an unlikely hero. A unique animated feature, the movie contains a story line and humor that appeal to an adult audience. The animation is top notch, and there are quite a few clever lines throughout. Johnny Depp has created an endearing character in Rango, whom I found myself rooting for throughout the film. Rango is an animated film that adults can enjoy.
B004FEFZU2|1.0|This last movie had a some what good plot, however I agree with most that the filming was done in a very cheap manner. I bought this specifically for the 3d, and to be honest it was everything but 3d. Very little effects leaves you unhappy after paying $40 at the local store. If you want to see this movie rent it and save your cash, not worth keeping. Most of all do not expect a good 3d experience at all, I thought it was me at first but have read the same thing in other peoples reviews. I hope this helps

B000FC1IMM|5.0|This is not a review of the book (which is a personal favorite), but of some of the Kindle editions, because all reviews of Howards End are lumped together, and the descriptions under the Kindle editions can be misleading.<br /><br />1) Random House Digital: Kindle version of the excellent 1999 Modern Library Classics edition. It includes the same biographical information, introduction by James Ivory, and commentaries by Virginia Woolf, Lionel Trilling, et al. It's also formatted the same as the paperback (correspondence in italics, e.g.).<br /><br />A MUST HAVE for Forster/Howards End lovers. It has gone in and out of availability on Kindle, with corresponding price rises, so grab it while you can!!!<br />[[ASIN:B000FC1IMM Howards End (Modern Library Classics)]]<br /><br />2) Halcyon Classics: Contains four Forster novels (including Howards End) and seven short stories: the wonderful \\"The Road from Colonus\\" and several more I can't wait to read. Formatted simply but clearly.<br /><br />A GREAT DEAL for two bucks!<br />[[ASIN:B002YK458M Howards End and Other Works by E.M.

B00356CO1E|4.0|I bought this a couple of weeks ago and have done it several times, and I think I'm ready to graduate to Level 2 already. It's a good workout, and the first couple of times I did it I thought it was pretty intense. Some of the strength moves are still challenging, since they're long sets, but my HR never gets as high as I like it to when I exercise, and I don't sweat very much. I wish it had more and/or longer cardio segments, and it would be nice if the video were maybe 10 minutes longer (although I'll admit that on days when I'm in a hurry, the brevity is a big selling point). It was only $2 as an Amazon Instant Video, and it was definitely worth buying -- I'll still use it on days when I want a lighter, shorter workout.    For perspective, I'm a runner, and I also bike, lift, and do P90X and the Brazil Butt Lift series, so I started out with an intermediate fitness level. Beginners will probably find this workout a lot more challenging and satisfying.    Overall it's a good workout, although it's not as good as some others I've tried. The Firm: Calorie Explosion is REALLY good, and it's a similar cardio/strength mix but more challenging, plus it's composed of 4 modular segments that you can combine however you want to customize the intensity and length of your workout.
B000FC2PKG|4.0|I was surprised to find this book was so good from beginning to end. This is the first book by Lisa Gardner I've read and did not know what to expect. I read a lot of mystery thrillers and this is one of the best. It is not formula driven and is exciting at every turn. The characters are real and interesting and she keeps you guessing all the way to the end. I will be reading more of her books, no question.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Excellent series and a great prequel that fills in back stories mentioned in Blood & Sand. And again we're left wondering about Lucretia's fate since there is still movement when they show the final scene of Blood & Sand in the beginning of Gods of the Arena.   But jeez, what's with price of the 6-episode series being almost as much as the 13-episode original season? And that's even with Amazon's 30% off...
1439181780|5.0|This little book did just that, in very important ways.  Focusing one's heart / soul / thoughts on negative things begets more negative in one's life.  I've read that there are many such little 'motivational' books and that \\"The Power\\" is a bit of a compilation of parts of several other books.  That may be so; some ice cream flavors are similar (but all are good).  This book is put together with care; quotations and 'decorations' are presented nicely; and the whole thing flows very well.  Perhaps the best testament is that I've bought and given away about 8 copies of \\"The Power\\" since I started reading the book in Sept. of 2010.  I give it to people I care about.  I'm pretty sure it gets \\"paid forward\\" by the giftees as well.  YOU WILL LOVE THIS GRAND LITTLE BOOK, AND IT WILL LOVE YOU BACK AS IT TRANSFORMS YOU FOR THE BETTER.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|I have read the book and watched the movie when it came out in the theater.<br /><br />I have watched this movie many times since I ordered it.  I like the overall story, there are only a couple of dead spots in the film and the computer aspect is very appealing to me being part of the tech industry.  This movie can be inspiring in terms that someone can have a killer idea and wind up dominating the Internet world - it proves that success can come out of the blue, but there may be complications along the way to the top.
B0000C03AH|5.0|This comment in on the size of the CD Box. The box is HUGE!  There are 10 separate plastic jewel cases (the tenth being a bones CD recording of a rehersal of the the Ninth Symphony). So if you are short on storage space, be a where that this box is way too big!  Other then that the performance and sound is outstanding!!!
B003A4IFGY|5.0|this is a FANTASTIC record.  it proves if you stick to the sound that your fan base wants, you will NEVER disappoint!!!!!!!! the licks are there, so's the rythem.  it definately HAS MOJO!!!!!!!!!
B003VANOFY|5.0|This product is fantastic. I do consider myself an audiophile and even with that in mind, I find the sound quality stellar. The emphasis of the sound signature is definitely on clarity and neutrality and I think it does very well in accurately representing anything you throw at it with high fidelity. The wireless-ness is so comfortable and convenient and the overall fit and finish is top-notch. The battery life is actually pretty good and the range is unbelievable. I can literally be on the opposite side of my house and everything will be loud and clear. The asterisk on this review (and the reason why this gets 4 stars in my mind) is that, in my opinion, they can get uncomfortable after 2-3 hours. Considering this is marketed towards gamers, and that span of time gaming is quite common, this is a fairly large concern for me. The pads are leather and because of the really comfortable, plushy memory foam, they completely envelope your ears. This makes my ears get quite warm and irritated after a while. However, having said that, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this headset for anyone looking for the best you can get, as my ears are quite sensitive and get very hot very easily. Normal people would most likely not have a single issue with the comfort over any span of time. 4 stars for me in particular, but overall a solid 5 star product.
B004EI2NM2|5.0|A Females opinion (rather than just a bunch of drooling males):    <3'd IT!! :)  yes it was beeuutiful... but I loved the romance between the two more so.    To the previous responses: I LOVED the ending = 5 stars

0756404738|4.0|Patrick Rothfuss once revealed he originally envisioned the Kingkiller Trilogy to be only one massive book. The Wise Man's Fear confirms his words, as the book unfolds as the middle part of a single book, providing the journeyman years of Kvothe, but little development towards the crucial questions of the book. Despite superb writing and diverting subplots, the book lacks the central goal which underlied the masterpiece that was the Name of the Wind. The first book had the benefit of introducing us to Kvothe's world, creating the rules and characters of Rothfuss' universe, as well as hinting at the ultimate challenges he would face. The culmination of the book could be seen as Kvothe speaking the Name of the Wind and the readers glimpsing the man and legend Kvothe was about to become, but knowing the mysterious future where he would end up as the angry and defeated Kote.    The second book is simply collection of tales of Kvothe, where few secrets are revealed (how does Kvothe get expelled? what is the four paneled door? What are Elodin's secrets that he seems the grown-up, wacked out version of Kvothe?), there are few major developments in character, and none of Kvothe's relationships advance. The book begins and finishes at the University, with Kvothe's life little changed except for a series of new skills and items he picked up, and a bit extra pocket change. He knows little more of the Chandrian, Denna reverts to the same romantic enigma and it's insinuated Kvothe has an ability to see names which will doubtlessly be important.    The book reads like Rothfuss' proverbial townsfolk sitting round the fire telling anecdotes of Kvothe. The story jumps from quest to quest, building the person who becomes Kvothe the Arcane. While a very good read, it places enormous pressure on the last book to deliver a finish worthy of the story Rothfuss began. So many characters with open-ended stories will need to be addressed (the Amyr, Elodin, Lorren, the Chandrian, Ambrose, Denna & patron, Bast needs to be introduced) that it will be stunning if Rothfuss can perform it in one final book. The Wise Man's Fear is an excellent middle of a story, an enjoyable middle of a book where we learn about the hero rather than his ultimate quest, but it will need a superb third book to make the trilogy live up to the standard of the Name of the Wind. I have faith he can deliver, even if it means another four years waiting.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After finishing the first book I picked this one up as fast as i could.  Somehow I found the second book better than the first.  Perhaps because I couldn't even guess where it was going to take the characters.  It did not disappoint!
0345479092|1.0|This book was not what I hoped it would be.  I read the book and tried out her way of getting your baby to sleep and it did not work!  It just frustrated me and made me stay up with my child most of the night.  She says not to let your baby cry itself to sleep because that's mean to the baby and the baby doesn't deserve it blah blah blah.  I let my baby cry through a middle of the night feeding once he was old enough to be sleeping through the night and then the next night all I had to do was put a binkie in his mouth and on the third night he didn't even wake up.  My way worked way better than hers.  Don't waste your money and buy the book, see if your local library has it if you really want to read it.

B0009MAP90|4.0|Even though Dylan only penned two tracks on his debut, he makes all the other cover songs his own by imbuing them with a passionate vocal delivery and stellar arrangements. Those shocked at his later Christian conversion phase should note that Dylan covers a good amount of Gospel and spiritual material here (\\"Gospel Plow,\\" \\"In My Time of Dyin',\\" etc.) showing that his interest in Christian themes should not have been a complete surprise. Of his originals, the autobiographical \\"Talkin' New York\\" gives us a glimpse of the master storyteller Dylan would become, and \\"Song to Woody\\" pays heartfelt tribute to his musical hero. The remaster is so crystal clear that on a good stereo system it sounds as if Dylan is performing live right in your listening room. One can only hope that Columbia will give us completely remastered versions of ALL of Dylan's output (even those critically bashed '80s albums that fans still find merit in).
B00402FGE4|1.0|All of the obvious doofi who gave this show a 5 star rating had to have been paid.  This show was one huge reason why MGM went bankrupt, and not even James Bond and his franchise could save them.  The show was anything but a \\"Stargate\\" show.  This series had absolutely nothing to do with the Stargate Universe (not the show, nitwits) other than it had a stargate in it.  True fans of the Stargate Universe shudder at the mere mention of this atrocity.  Thank God and all that is holy that we have been put out of our misery by its cancellation.  The 2 seasons it was on was 2 seasons too many.

0553805371|3.0|The following was a short and concise critique that William Lane Craig gave. If someone does decide to attempt to rebut it themselves by leaving a comment, don't expect me to answer. In all honesty, I don't really care too much what online theists and atheists have to argue. I like to read legitimate published material by men and women with doctorate degrees and experience in their fields. That's not to say you shouldn't comment, but don't hope for me to respond! Thanks        The Grand Design and Philosophy    Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow open their book The Grand Design with a series of profound questions: What is the nature of reality? Where did all this come from? Did the universe need a Creator? Then they say, \\"Traditionally these are questions for philosophy, but philosophy is dead. Philosophy has not kept up with modern developments in science, particularly physics. Scientists have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge.\\"1    The professional philosopher can only roll his eyes at the effrontery and condescension of such a statement. Two scientists, who have to all appearances little acquaintance with philosophy, are prepared to pronounce an entire discipline dead and to insult their own faculty colleagues in philosophy at Cal Tech and Cambridge University -- many of whom, such as Michael Redhead and D.H. Mellor, are eminent philosophers of science -- for supposedly failing to keep up.    The professional philosopher will regard their verdict as not merely amazingly condescending but also as outrageously naïve. The man who claims to have no need of philosophy is the one most apt to be fooled by it. One might therefore anticipate that Mlodinow and Hawking's subsequent exposition of their favored theories will be underpinned by a host of unexamined philosophical presuppositions. That expectation is, in fact, borne out. They assert their claims about laws of nature, the possibility of miracles, scientific determinism, andthe illusion of free will with only the thinnest of justification. Clearly Mlodinow and Hawking are up to their necks in philosophical questions.    What one might not expect is that, after pronouncing the death of philosophy, Hawking and Mlodinow should themselves plunge immediately into a philosophical discussion of scientific realism vs. antirealism. The first third of their book is not about current scientific theories at all but is a disquisition on the history and philosophy of science. I found this section to be the most interesting and mind-boggling of the whole book. Let me explain.    Having set aside a Monday afternoon to read Hawking and Mlodinow's book, I had spent that morning working through a scholarly article from Blackwell's Contemporary Debates in Metaphysics on a philosophical viewpoint known as ontological pluralism. Ontological pluralism is a view in a subdiscipline of philosophy whose name sounds like stuttering: meta-metaphysics, or, as it is sometimes called, meta-ontology. This is philosophy at its most ethereal. Ontology is the study of being, or of what exists -- the nature of reality. Meta-ontology is one notch higher: It inquires whether ontological disputes are meaningful and how best to resolve them.    Ontological pluralism holds that there really is no right answer to many ontological questions, such as: Do composite objects exist? According to the ontological pluralist, there are just different ways of describing reality, and none of these is more correct or accurate than another. There literally is no fact of the matter at all in answer to these questions. So if you were to ask, \\"Is there such a thing as the Moon?\\" the ontological pluralist would say that the question has no objective answer. It is not true that the Moon exists, and it is not true that the Moon does not exist. There just is no fact of the matter about whether there is such a thing as the Moon. Ontological pluralism is thus a radical view that is defended by a handful of philosophers.    Imagine my astonishment, therefore, to find Hawking and Mlodinow espousing ontological pluralism (without being aware of the name) as their philosophy of science. They call their view \\"model-dependent realism.\\" They explain that models are just different ways of interpreting our sense perceptions. In their view there is no objective reality to which our models of the world more or less accurately correspond (page 7).    Mlodinow and Hawking are thus extreme antirealists. For example, contrasting young earth creationism and the big bang theory, Hawking and Mlodinow claim that while the big bang theory is \\"more useful,\\" nevertheless, \\"neither model can be said to be more real than the other\\" (page 51).    One cannot help but wonder what sort of argument would justify adopting so radical a view. All that Mlodinow and Hawking have to offer is the fact if we were, say, inhabitants of a virtual reality controlled by alien beings, then there would be no way for us to tell that we were in the simulated world and so would have no reason to doubt its reality (page 42). The trouble with this sort of argument is that it does not exclude the possibility that we have in this case two competing models of the world -- one the aliens' and one ours, and one of the models is true and one false, even if we cannot tell which is which.    Moreover, the fact our observations are model-dependent does not imply that we cannot have knowledge of the way the world is (much less that there is no way the world is). For example, a layman entering a scientific laboratory might see a piece of machinery on the lab table, but he would not see it as an interferometer, since he lacks the theoretical knowledge to recognize it as such. A caveman entering the laboratory would not even see there is a piece of machinery on the table, since he lacks the concept of a machine. But that does nothing to undermine the objective truth of the lab technician's observation that there is an interferometer on the table.    Mlodinow and Hawking, not content with ontological pluralism, really go off the deep end when they assert, \\"There is no model-independent test of reality. It follows that a well-constructed model creates a reality of its own\\" (page 172). This is an assertion of ontological relativity, the view that reality itself is different for persons having different models.    If you are Fred Hoyle, the universe really has existed eternally in a steady state; but if you are Stephen Hawking, the universe really began with a big bang. If you are the ancient physician Galen, blood really does not circulate through the human body; but if you are William Harvey, who discovered circulation, it does. Such a view seems crazy and is made only more so by Mlodinow and Hawking's claim that the model itself is responsible for creating its respective reality. It hardly needs to be said that no such conclusion follows from there being no model-independent test of the way the world is.    All this is, however, beside the main point. The main point is that despite their claim to speak as scientific torchbearers of knowledge, what Hawking and Mlodinow are engaged in is philosophy. The most important conclusions drawn in their book are philosophical, not scientific. Why, then, do they pronounce philosophy dead and claim as scientists to be bearing the torch of discovery? Simply because that enables them to cloak their amateurish philosophizing with the mantle of scientific authority and so avoid the hard work of actually arguing for, rather than merely asserting, their philosophical viewpoints.      Why Does the Universe Exist?    In their book, Hawking and Mlodinow seek to answer three questions that they set themselves in chapter 1:    1. Why is there something rather than nothing?    2. Why do we exist?    3. Why this particular set of laws and not some other?    Curiously, their answers to each of these questions turn out to be very brief. In fact, (2) gets folded into (1) and so does not even receive a separate answer.    Hawking and Mlodinow's answer to questions (1) and (2) is an appeal to the \\"no boundary\\" model of the origin of the universe, popularized by Hawking in his book, A Brief History of Time. Our authors simply expound the model without adducing any evidence for it or mentioning any of the alternative models to it. Nor do they respond to the criticism that the so-called \\"imaginary time\\" featured in the model is physically unintelligible and therefore merely a mathematical \\"trick\\" useful for avoiding the cosmological singularity which appears in classical theories of the beginning of the universe.    Still, their exposition is not without interest with regard to the beginning of the universe. For example, they write: \\"The realization that time can behave like another direction of space means one can get rid of the problem of time having a beginning, in a similar way in which we got rid of the edge of the world. Suppose the beginning of the universe was like the South Pole of the earth, with degrees of latitude playing the role of time. As one moves north, the circles of constant latitude, representing the size of the universe, would expand. The universe would start as a point at the South Pole, but the South Pole is much like any other point. To ask what happened before the beginning of the universe would become a meaningless question, because there is nothing south of the South Pole. In this picture space-time has no boundary -- the same laws of nature hold at the South Pole as in other places\\" (page 134-5).    This passage is fascinating because if we take the analogy seriously, it posits a beginning point to both time and the universe. Despite the fact that imaginary time behaves like another spatial dimension, Hawking allows the circles of latitude to play the role of time, which has a beginning point at the South Pole. When Hawking speaks of \\"the problem of time having a beginning,\\" what he means is \\"the age-old objection to the universe having a beginning\\" (page 135) an objection which his model removes. That age-old objection is the question, \\"What happened before the beginning of the universe?\\" Hawking is right that this question is meaningless on his model. But what he fails to mention is that the question is equally meaningless on the standard big bang model, since there is nothing prior to the initial cosmological singularity. Or either model the universe has an absolute temporal beginning.    So the question is, Why did the universe begin to exist? Why is there something rather than nothing? Hawking and Mlodinow advocate what they call a \\"top-down\\" approach to this question. The idea here is to begin with our presently observed universe characterized by the standard model of particle physics and then calculate, given the no boundary condition, the probability of the various histories allowed by quantum physics to reach our present state. The most probable history represents the history of our observable universe. Hawking and Mlodinow claim that, \\"In this view, the universe appeared spontaneously from nothing\\" (page 136). By \\"spontaneously\\" they seem to mean, without a cause.    But how does that follow from the model? The top-down approach calculates the probability of our observable universe given the no boundary condition. The top-down approach does not calculate the probability that the no boundary condition should exist but takes it for granted. Such a condition is not metaphysically or physically necessary. If the universe came into being uncaused from nothing, it could have had any sort of conceivable spatiotemporal configuration. For nothingness, or nonbeing, has no properties or constraints and is governed by no physical laws. Physics only begins at the \\"South Pole\\" in the no boundary model. There is not anything in the model that implies that that point came to be without a cause. Indeed, the idea that being could arise without a cause from nonbeing seems metaphysically absurd.    Hawking and Mlodinow seem to realize they have not yet answered the question, \\"Why is there something rather than nothing?\\" They return to this question in their concluding chapter and give a quite different answer. There they explain there is a constant vacuum energy contained in empty space, and if the universe's positive energy associated with matter is evenly balanced by the negative energy associated with gravitation, then the universe can spontaneously come into being as a fluctuation of the energy in the vacuum (which, by a clever sleight of hand, they say \\"we may as well call ... zero\\").    This seems to be a very different account of the universe's origin, for it presupposes the reality of space and the energy in it. So it is puzzling when Mlodinow and Hawking conclude, \\"Because there is a law like gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing in the manner described in Chapter 6\\" (page 180). Here it is said that the nothingness spoken of in Chapter 6 is not really nothingness after all but is space filled with vacuum energy. This goes to reinforce the conviction that the no boundary approach only describes the evolution of our universe from its origin at its \\"South Pole\\" to its present state but is silent as to why the universe came to exist in the first place.    What this implies is that Hawking and Mlodinow have not even begun to address the philosophical question, \\"Why is there something rather than nothing?\\" For \\"nothing\\" in their vocabulary does not have the traditional meaning \\"nonbeing\\" but rather means \\"the quantum vacuum.\\" They are not even answering the same question. Like the philosophy student who, to the question, \\"What is Time?\\" on his final exam, answered, \\"a weekly news magazine,\\" so Hawking and Mlodinow have avoided the tough question by equivocation.      Why Is the Universe Fine-tuned for Life?    If they have failed to answer questions (1) and (2), what about (3): Why is there this particular set of laws rather than some other? The issue here is explaining the apparently miraculous fine-tuning of the universe for intelligent life. Hawking and Mlodinow express this idea by observing that \\"in recent years physicists began asking themselves what the universe would have been like if the laws of nature were different\\" (page 159). Unfortunately, this statement is very misleading. Scientists grappling with fine-tuning are not asking what the universe would have been like if it were governed by different laws of nature. Rather they are asking what the universe would have been like if it were governed by the same laws of nature but with different values for the physical constants appearing in them and with different quantities for the initial conditions on which the laws operate.    Nobody knows what a universe governed by different laws would be like. But because we are talking about universes governed by the same laws, but with different numbers plugged in for the constants and quantities, we can calculate what kind of universe the laws would predict (just as Hawking and Mlodinow illustrate on page 159-62). So question (3) is malformed as stated. The real question is: Why this particular set of constants and quantities rather than some other?    Now there are three possible answers to that question: physical necessity, chance, or design. Hawking and Mlodinow reject the hypothesis of physical necessity: \\"It appears that the fundamental numbers, and even the form, of the apparent laws of nature are not demanded by logic or physical principle\\" (page 143). Since Mlodinow and Hawking want nothing to do with a Cosmic Designer, they opt for the hypothesis of chance. Since the odds of our universe's being fine-tuned for intelligent life are so incomprehensibly remote, Hawking and Mlodinow appeal to the Many Worlds Hypothesis to augment one's probabilistic resources to the extent that it becomes inevitable that a finely-tuned universe will appear by chance somewherein the World Ensemble or multiverse. If there are an infinite number of randomly ordered universes in the Ensemble, then a finely-tuned universe will appear somewhere in the Ensemble by chance alone.    If the Many Worlds Hypothesis is to be serious science rather than metaphysical speculation, some sort of mechanism needs to be provided to generate the World Ensemble. The mechanism to which Hawking and Mlodinow appeal is Richard Feynman's \\"sum-over-histories\\" approach to quantum theory. This is the approach Hawking uses in the no boundary model to calculate the most probable history of the universe, given the no boundary condition, to our present observed state. Hawking and Mlodinow take these alternative histories that the universe might have pursued to be actual, parallel universes that are just as real as our universe.    Unfortunately, this is not science but a gratuitous piece of metaphysics. Feynman's sum-over-histories method is just a mathematical tool for calculating the probability of a subatomic particle's arriving at one point from another. One imagines all the possible paths the particle could have taken and then on that basis calculates the probability of its reaching the observed destination. There's no basis for interpreting this mathematical \\"trick\\" to imply the ontological reality of concrete, spatio-temporal universes.    Hawking and Mlodinow also appeal to M-Theory or superstring theory to generate the World Ensemble of universes exhibiting various values for the constants of nature. Such a speculation is problematic in a number of ways that they do not discuss. First, the \\"cosmic landscape\\" of 10500 different possible universes consistent with nature's laws that M-Theory allows are just that: possibilities. They are not real worlds, anymore than are Feynman's histories.    Second, it's not clear that 10500 possibilities are sufficient to guarantee the existence of finely-tuned universes in the landscape. What if the probability of fine-tuningis less than 1:10500? This may be especially problematic concerning the arbitrary initial conditions.    Finally, does the multiverse itself described by M-Theory exhibit fine-tuning? If it does, then the problem has only been pushed back a notch. It seems that it does, for as Hawking and Mlodinow explain, M-Theory requires precisely eleven dimensions if it is to be viable. Yet the theory cannot account for why just that number of dimensions should exist.    Moreover, Mlodinow and Hawking do not even mention, much less respond to, Roger Penrose's trenchant criticism of the Many Worlds Hypothesis for explaining fine-tuning in his The Road to Reality. Namely, he argues that if we were just a random member of a World Ensemble, then it is incomprehensibly more probable that we should be observing a much different universe than what we do, which strongly disconfirms the Many Worlds Hypothesis. There is no excuse for Hawking's failure to respond to his erstwhile collaborator's criticisms of Hawking's view.    Conclusion    In summary, despite Hawking and Mlodinow's vaunted assertions and constant sniping at religious belief throughout this book, there is actually genuine profit in it for religious believers, especially for those interested in natural theology. For the authors affirm and argue for the facts of an absolute beginning of time and the universe and of the apparently miraculous fine-tuning of the universe for intelligent life. Given the desperation and/or irrelevancy of their proffered answers to the questions that motivated their inquiry, their book turns out to be quite supportive of the existence of a transcendent Creator and Designer of the cosmos.
030746363X|5.0|I've read through most of the book, hitting sections as they appealed to me, as the author suggests in the beginning. A LOT of whats in here has been really useful, some of it looks to be useful in the future, some of it is in essence a cautionary tale, and some of it is less useful or incorrect. As the author points out in the beginning of the book this is true of all information. Its up to you to figure out which pieces are which and its getting people to learn that process to be critical thinkers and self experimenters that this book is really doing.    Most of the very critical reviews have been by doctors. I'm not surprised. They are so addicted to substituting authority for truth that they can't even recognize someone espousing a very different viewpoint.     Even if you decide that FOR YOU its 90% bunk the process of making that determination will leave you better off and certainly have paid back the price of admission.
0525951652|2.0|Well, I really loved Pillars of the Earth and liked World without End, so I thought I would enjoy this. Wrong. It becomes very predictable. The mean selfish rich people take advantage of the peasants and the peasants are heros and everyone gets knocked up. Throw in his opinion of politics and that's the book. Lots of rambling about socialism, liberals, conservatism, etc.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele's newest CD is fantastic! She has grown as a person and her singing is just getting better! She has a powerful voice and has a great pressance on this album. I would recommend this CD to anyone who is interested. There is only one song that I do not like. All the other songs are fantastic! :D
6305657947|5.0|The first time I saw the title and cover for this movie, my reaction was bleh. Pierce Brosnan in some lovey-dovey romp AND a remake? Not my thing. But once I watched it and saw how his character Thomas Crown is a brilliant manipulator who steals artwork just to amuse himself, and the absolutely brilliant resolution to the movie, it became one of my all time favorites. And yeah, he gets the girl, but he had to really work at it. It's a perfect date-night movie. I don't want to say too much, because it's the plot that makes this movie so great.
B002SRQ214|5.0|This processor runs cool, operates fast, and Works Like an i7 with the perfect set up..... I would recommend this other than a 6 core......
B002ZNJW0O|4.0|Sparks on a whole is a fantastic writer which is why I continue to read each of his books as they are released. The Lucky One is another quick read. He always knows how to create a great little world in which all of his characters live. This particular story is centered around a traveling soldier, a creepy ex-husband and the ex-wife who can't seem to find love. It is a bit of a puzzle, but Sparks never leaves you without clues to figure it out on your own. The only negative I would say about this particular book is that the ending was a little disappointing and short. Definitely a book for any true Sparks fan to enjoy though!
0670022411|5.0|Lions and Tigers and ... wait! I mean Witches and Daemons and Vampires Oh My!  I confess one of my guilty pleasures is reading about vampires, witches, and things that go bump in the night. I just have not been inclined to share my attraction to these fantasies with my book club, friends etc. They are  not interested. And I say \\"So be it, I don't need them.\\"  After reading  \\"A Discovery of Witches\\"  however, I think for the first time I might be able to recommend it to some of my friends. Aside from the fact that it is difficult to read in bed as it is a very big heavy book, it is really good. I did get the feeling after finishing, that books like Kim Harrison's \\"Hollows\\" series (I do enjoy them) with her witch Rachel Morgan who is dealing somewhat with the same problems as \\"A Discovery ...\\" (getting the vampires, demons and witches to basically get along) is in comparison the comic book or maybe, a better example the \\"Classic Comic\\" (that we used to write book reports from rather than read the whole novel back in my day) and, that \\"A Discovery Of Witches\\" is the real honest to goodness novel that tells it like it should be. It is fiction no doubt but if feels substantial and real.  As I said I liked it, I raced through it and, even though I had read a review relating to it's ending I was thoroughly able to enjoy it. I only hope that Deborah Harkness has a darn good start of the sequel because I'm sure it will be another BIG book and I don't like to wait.

1401929281|5.0|Thank you Viana for sharing your gift with the world! This technique gets at the root cause of illness and dis-ease- -mental, emotional, physical, spiritual- and heals on that level, often instantly.     Like Viana I have healed myself many times after a grim diagnosis from the medical community. Although I knew it was possible to do this for others, I couldn't break down how it happened. Viana does it so precisely and completely in this wonderful work.    Theta healing is not for every practitioner. It requires a humble, compassionate person with a love of humanity who is centered in love and true gratitude...egos must be checked at door. A Theta Healer knows they are the facilitator, conduit and witness to The Creators healing. The healing does not come from you, it comes through you. Through the process of learning and practicing, you may evolve and acquire the afore mentioned quatities if you don't already have them. Learning and practicing with friend or partner will more likely facilitate the belief work that may need to be done before you will be an effective Theta Healer.    This method requires you to understand and know how to go to Heart, Zero Point, the Theta state, pure consciousness, to connect with the Creator of all that is. If you do not have experience with this you may need to learn more about this connection and how to achieve it prior to successfully using this healing modality.
1416550550|4.0|I'm a man, and I'm not supposed to like books of this type. But I did.<br /><br />It's not a perfect book and there are weaknesses, especially Eliza's stories. I kept wondering why anyone at any period of time would publish them. They didn't sound like a child's book of fairy tales.<br /><br />Despite that, Morton kept me reading until I finished. Moving between three time periods was perfect for this book.

B000YIGNKE|5.0|I, for one, loved this version. Since I have not read any Jane Austin books I do not have to worry about trying to compare the movie to the book. Throughout my lifetime, I have found few movies that follow the book. Actually, outside of the story line, my main enjoyment of the movie was Rupert Penry-Jones--he has such beautiful, expressive eyes--the rest of him isn't bad either. I, unlike most reviewers did not mind Ann running through the streets--if I had waited 8 years for a man I loved and then thought I was going to lose him again, you better believe I would have run through the streets too--convention or no. As for the kiss at the end, I thought that the slow motion only added to the anticipitation,my only regret is that the kiss could have lasted longer.

B000O8OTNC|3.0|This seems to be an okay little sharpener.  And by \\"okay\\", I mean it will do a satisfactory job in returning a useable edge to your knife.  It will NOT give your knife a smooth, razor sharp edge.  Anyone well practiced in using a quality whetstone or other such sharpening system will probably be disappointed in the quality of the edge this product gives.  I would recommend this sharpener for a lightweight emergency kit, where it would be impractical to carry a more bulky sharpening system.  Just don't ever use it on a high quality knife, where a smooth, well-finished edge would be desirable.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|I use it with a small video camera, and it makes it easier to hold the camera steady, and also makes it easier to set the camera securely on a flat surface.

B003OFHMKO|2.0|There is no doubt Esperanza is talented and beautiful but she suffers from self-indulgence and repetitious scat singing which I've never liked.  I can put up with a little of it when someone like Curt Elling does it, but she scats more than she sings and her thin reedy voice just can't keep it interesting.  Her meandering compositions are not melodically strong enough to hold my interest.  All three albums suffer the same flaws to my ear.  One can only hope as she matures that she will write more songs with actual words and melody and some emotional depth.
B00436GNVC|2.0|Success has been a bittersweet thing for Aimee Ann Duffy. She had immediate success, but was lumped in as an Amy Winehouse clone. Her debut single \\"Mercy\\" was an immediate smash, but was quickly pegged as a one-hit wonder before she even released a second single from her debut album \\"Rockferry\\". By the time she released the dreary but successful second single \\"Warwick Avenue\\", she was written off as a fake by fellow musicians- the most scathing of remarks coming from fellow British singer Estelle. She went back into the studio in early 2010 to record a new album, and did a bit of cleaning house in the process. She got rid of her manager, sacked \\"Rockferry\\" producers Bernard Butler and Jimmy Hogarth and changed virtually all of the session musicians. She replaced the previous session musicians with the hip hop band The Roots and hired the legendary British singer-songwriter Albert Hammond to handle the production of her sophomore album \\"Endlessly\\".<br /><br />After listening to her second release, it seems as if her desire to have more creative input was rather questionable. The album suffers from too much creative control- lyrically, the songs are borderline juvenile and the musical arrangements are bland and uninspired. Look no further than the lead off track \\"My Boy\\", which sounds a little too close to Rod Stewart's disco hit \\"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy\\"- and that's not a good thing. On the ballads \\"Too Hurt To Dance\\", \\"Don't Forsake Me\\" and the title track \\"Endlessly\\" her vocals are a little grating on the nerves the first time around. She sounds as if she may have knocked back a few shortly before she started recording. She sings a little out of key on the first single \\"Well Well Well\\" and gets upstaged by The Roots in the process. \\"Lovestruck\\" suffers from a terrible vocal performance, while \\"Girl\\" is overwrought with cringe-worthy songwriting. While Duffy meant well on this album, she fails miserably in trying to do things her way. In her case, maybe she should have stuck to the formula on her first album a little longer.o the formula on her first album a little longer.
1936594293|1.0|This is without question the worst book I've ever read in my entire life.  The style is clumsy though the author strives to impress with an aristocratic pompousness so typical of social climbers of her day.  The characters are cold, their development dull and boring and Austen's every attempt to portray the most basic of human relationships falls well short, getting completely tangled in ridiculously elite language that was in its day and remains still completely outdated. Commoners did not speak like that then, nor do they now.  I would rather endure a daily root canal than read this book again.  It was almost as inspirational as witnessing a mountain top removal to mine coal.  It doesn't surprise me that her original manuscript was rejected as it should have been and now I wonder to what extent politics played a role in her eventual success?  Perhaps zero of five stars would be more accurate...
B000GIXEIG|4.0|I anticipated this movie before it was released because I had read some of the background on the concepts used by the director & the screen writer and found them intriguing. It was released but not to wide distribution because it got overwhelmed by the Big Studio oohhh-gosh animated version featuring Angelina Jolie's voice & likeness cast on her animated Grendel mother with scaly tail & pneumatic bosom. I've now seen both versions, this one twice. And I like this one just fine... it's a movie that tells a well-known story in a different way. However, this movie only focuses on the conflict between Beowulf, Grendel, & his mother (all of which occur in the first half of the epic). It doesn't carry on to Beowulf becoming a king who rules for decades & goes off to slay a dragon in the end.<br />So for all the critics who are whining about this movie doesn't follow the original epic poem written in Old English around 1000 CE about mythical events taking place in a foreign land 300 years earlier - let's get one thing straight. It has long been established by scholars of the original epic that the ORIGINAL story doesn't have a whole lot of continuity or unity or even make sense EITHER folks. It seems to vacillate between being a traditional Nordic-Germanic hero tale of super-man VS. super-monster, but then there's a bunch of discordant pseudo-Christian elements thrown in (likely due to the influence of that increasingly popular religion) and a variety of other inconsistencies that do make it somewhat disjointed. So are the critics suggesting that the film makers should have made their movie equally confusing? Or perhaps, like most adaptations of ancient writings (how about Shakespeare?) we allow them to take artistic license & attempt to explain the story in a new & perhaps more meaningful way to a modern audience?<br />And let's not forget that the epic poem, although it's the 'oldest written work in English', was virtually unknown & ignored until the mid-1800's.<br />Thus I think it was worth the attempt for the film makers to re-create the 'myth' in a more reasonable & realistic manner... with a hero whose larger-than-life reputation for battle-glory is the subject of sarcasm by his crew (how refreshing that was). And a sympathetic 'monster'... did you scream \\"Foul!\\"when Van Helsing's Frankenstein monster was more benign than the original too, even poignantly self-aware?<br />And yes, there's a woman in the movie who never appears in the epic... how awful that they'd break from the macho tradition of male-bonding action adventure to throw in a woman & some complicated side-story... but that's modern movies (and society, if you want to be realistic).<br />For those who seemed confused by the presentation of Grendel, THIS Grendel monster was clearly intended to be a surviving remnant of a co-habiting hominid such as Australopithecus... that was the script writers stated goal. There's NO magic, no mysticism, no supernatural demonic forces... just Nature. An interesting idea when we realize fossils such as the \\"Hobbit\\" people of Indonesia (Bali?) discovered a few years ago who definitely co-existed with modern humans.<br />Also, Hrothgar was a man in despair... taken to drink to drown his guilt over his inability to protect his village as a good chieftain must.<br />The epileptic, zealous Irish Christian priest was a treat for me... some excellent dialog betwixt him & Hrothgar. Perhaps this was a nod to the inconsistent Christian themes of the original.<br />As I recall, Grendel is only killing the warriors who hunted down his father years before (primitive hominids matured much faster than do modern humans, by age 12-15) that he appears able to identify by scent. So I'd have to disagree w/ all those who say he's killing 'everyone' in the village - I recall that differently.<br />And I have to admit, I'm extremely fond of the angle taken where one of Beowulf's crew is presented a bard who is composing verses that we can assume eventually become the epic poem... especially the witty lines about \\"Grendel, with the mark of Cain... we're all killers?\\"<br /><br />Overall, it was a decent effort by a non-Hollywood studio to make a movie... go watch it.especially the witty lines about \\"Grendel, with the mark of Cain... we're all killers?\\"    Overall, it was a decent effort by a non-Hollywood studio to make a movie... go watch it.
1582701709|1.0|Watched the first ten minutes of the DVD. Thats all I could take. From the start it was nothing at all like I expected. The last straw? The part where the girl is looking wistfully into a jewelry store window at a beautiful gold necklace. She then utilizes 'the secret' sending out her 'I want that necklace' brainwaves into the universe and the man inside the store brings the necklace out to her. Weather this was meant metaphorically or not doesnt matter. It was all I could take as the idiocy had been piling up from the beginning. It frustrates and saddens me that material like this can gain such popularity.
B002G4FQAC|5.0|I am kind of out of their demographic with tastes that are a combination of mainstream and classic rock, but I love this stuff. I bought all of their albums including the live one with the DVD. Paramore is the best. I only buy albums where I like all the songs on it, and this is one of those. A really good buy. This review feels very inadequate in comparison to the others, but I don't care, listen to the samples no matter who you are; if you dig, buy it.

0345509617|5.0|Another top notch making of book from Mr. Rinzler.  Incredible behind the scenes photos-- I thought I had seen them all after 30 years being a fan of this movie.  Terrific artwork-- concept drawings, storyboards, models, you name it.  The narrative is terrific-- you get not only the behind the scenes info during filming, you also get a very interesting look at how Lucasfilm was created on the business side-- I didn't think I'd find this interesting, but it was one of the best parts.  Also covers those years between the first two movies and the speculation about what the \\"Star Wars 2\\" would look like-- it was really fun to remember a time when we didn't know the rest of the story.  In this case, even George didn't know yet.  Sadly, it also brings home how bad the Prequel Trilogy is-- George stopped listening to his own advice-- get someone else to write the screenplay and to direct.  But I digress... Thank you Mr. Rinzler for your exhaustive research!     Wish list for Jedi: please put the narrative into electronic form.  Reading this book is a physical challenge-- I would have loved to have been able to thumb through the narrative on my Kindle.

1439102724|1.0|I love this author.  I have read every book and passed them around.  But not this one.  This isn't the first time I felt she had researched a subject to death and maybe didn't smooth the facts with much elegance.  This time it was glaring and she did a fairly crappy job of writing about issues surrounding infertility.  It felt like it was pulled from a scientific journal.  My biggest disappointment is the unexplored dissolution of Zoes marriage, her swift and largely unexplored love  affair with a women and their marriage which seemed to happen too fast.  None of the characters are well written.  They are not given depth and fullness.  It feels as if the author came up with another medical scenario, researched it and threw a lesbian relationship into the mix.  If I were a gay woman, I would be annoyed.  As a fan of this author, I am just so disappointed.

B004MMEIK0|3.0|How To Marry A Millionaire Vampire is a story about Shanna, a human female with a special talent, and Roman, the very wealthy head of the New York coven. He has created synthetic blood, which allows all but a few \\"Malcontents\\" to abstain from humans. One of the Malcontents is out to kill Shanna, and collect the reward, when Roman saves her. There are the predictable issues: he thinks he is headed straight for hell, she has problems trusting him, some miscommunication (Why don't people ever just talk about their concerns!!!), and a battle to save the day. Oh, and vampire sex, which doesn't even involve being in the same room.    My initial reaction after being introduced to these characters is that this novel is basically Twilight Fan-fiction, with a few details changed. The long-suffering male lead, the pretty but plain female with an abhorrence for blood, the neutering of the vampires through the availability of alternatives to blood... The vampires do stick closer to myth, though Roman spends much of the novel trying to find ways around the need to sleep during the day. If you like your vampires dangerous, you won't like the civilized, overly moral version that Kerrelyn Sparks creates. If you like Twilight I think you will enjoy these vamps, as they provide that spark of fantasy without getting too uncomfortable.     I went back and forth on giving the story a 2 or 3 star rating. The plot was predictable, and I'm not likely to read it again, but I also didn't have to force myself to read to the end, so I chose 3 stars. Just go in expecting fluff. Also, this is the first in a series, so if you do like the characters and the writing style, you will ahve many more opportunites with them, which I know is important to many romance readers.
B000Z9PYJS|5.0|Life of Pi  Yann Martel   Life of Pi is the epitome of discussion books, one that stirs and inspires debate and conversation many days, weeks and months after the book has been read. Life of Pi is a book that can be read over and over and elicit different results and reader reactions each time it is read. A complex book about religion and survival that grants the reader his/her own interpretation of the story without allowing anyone to refute it. Life of Pi is a true literary master piece that can be enjoyed by many different readers.    Life of Pi is about an Indian born boy by the name of Piscine Molitor Patel or Pi as he chose to be called, his religious exploration and his survival at sea for 227 days. The story begins like most religious fiction, glorifying one religion over the rest but quickly does and about face and introduces two more religions and atheism into the lineup. Pi a lover of God saw no reason why a person should not be allowed to practice freely any and all religious dogmas as he saw fit, so he practiced Hinduism, Islam and Christianity.  Religion was just a path to God in Pi's eyes and the more paths he established the more ways he was able to bask in the Almighty's glory and grace. The religious convictions he establishes as a child in India would help him survive if only spiritually while drifting in a life boat as a teenager on the open waters of the Pacific Ocean.    The Pacific Ocean is where most of the story about Pi takes place. The landscape of continually rolling waves comes alive through Yann Martel's use of words. Yann has an amazing vocabulary and can elicit beautiful and shocking imagery with it; he turns the dull ocean into something extraordinary. Extraordinary is not hard to come by when Pi is forced to share his life boat with a 450 pound Bengal tiger by the name of Richard Parker. Richard Parker and Pi become ship mates after the cargo ship they were on sinks. Richard Parker and Pi share a unique relationship and adventure asthey troll the mighty waters of the Pacific. The harmony between the tiger and the boy is essential if they both are to survive. Survive they both do but not before they suffer the effects of starvation, dehydration and bad weather many times over.   The story ends with an interview between Pi and two Japanese investigators for the Ministry of Transport in a Mexican hospital. The investigators are interested in what caused the cargo ship to sink and hoped that Pi could shed some light on it for them. Pi cannot shed light on the sinking of the ship and you would think that would be the end of the story but it is only the beginning. The conclusion to this story about survival at sea with a tiger is what makes this story a great discussion book. Not to give away any secrets this review will only surmise to say that the end offers a twist that will have you rethink the entire story.   Life of Pi is a beautifully written story by Yann Martel. The characters and story are well developed and mature as the story progresses. The imagery is so rich that it causes the reader to delight in the good and suffer during the bad. Life of Pi is a story about survival, religious convictions and a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker that everyone will enjoy in reading and discussing over and over again.
1439156816|5.0|Absolutely amazing book.  I haven't sat through a book the whole way without stopping since Deathly Hallows, and that was only because I wanted to beat my brother to the finish.  What I've read in Amazon's \\"most helpful\\" reviews is all that needs to be said.    Just one more thing, though...    The cover of the 10th Anniversary Edition is not made of your run-of-the-mill paper that all paperbacks are made of.  I don't know what it is, but it's easily my favorite paperback cover material.  I's so nice to the touch while I was reading I sometimes stopped between sections to feel the cover.  Not thick at all, and not flimsy and prone to unintentional creases like most paper covers.  Awesome.
B002ZG976U|3.0|I saw this movie in the theater with some girl friends and I was looking forward to seeing this movie because I loved Kristen Bell in Reefer Madness. I also think Christina Aguilera has an incredible voice.     Cons:     Kristen Bell is way under used in this movie. She can sing very well and they should have had her do at least a duet with Aguilera or Cher. I couldn't tell if she sang a song with her own voice or not. I know she was lip syncing to \\"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend\\" but I thought there was one other song which she sang but it's not on the soundtrack.      Christina Aguilera isn't a very good actress. Nice try for a first major role but the director should have had her working with an acting coach.      Cher's face is so tight from the botox and plastic surgery, it affects the way she talks.     Story line is what you'd expect. Typical small town girl with big talents wins over everyone and saves the day.       Pros    The singing is fantastic. Christina is so emotional when she sings I was literally getting chills. Unfortunately, her acting isn't as emotional and it seems to stand out even more when you compare Christina the singer vs. Christina the actress.     The music and dance numbers are a lot of fun. I was blown away when they added the tag to \\"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend\\". I'm almost afraid of being disappointed if I watch it on my home t.v. It thrilled me to see/hear it on the big screen. I understand why they didn't put it on the soundtrack (they don't want to pay royalties on someone else's song) but I would love to have the audio for this cranked to 11.    Music, Music, Music. I really enjoyed the music. I don't buy soundtracks too often but I had to get it. I'm not even a huge fan of current pop music. I noticed right away that the end credits song (Beautiful People) was sampling Marilyn Manson's Beautiful People. Seriously, not usually my genre of music but I was impressed with Christina's voice post Disney.     All in all, Burlesque is fun and entertaining with a couple of cringe worthy acting from Christina at certain moments. I will never make my husband watch this but I may get a group of girls to come over and watch this.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was by far the best book in the series. I disliked the epilogue because it was flat, so to speak. I could not believe it. Katniss Everdeen. The girl on fire. The Mockingjay. Spending the rest of her life in burnt down 12 hunting. The ending made the rest of her life seem fairly dull and one-dimensional. The book was wonderful otherwise.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|This show is awesome! I will miss it, but now I have all of the seasons so I can watch it whenever I want to! Yay!
0439023513|4.0|i enjoyed the story but not as much as the first book, hunger games.  this third book had too much dreaming and it was a little confusing because of it. i also wish they had more about Peete, gale and Finnick, especially at the end of the story and it would have been nice if the author elaborated more about the assasination. if you read the first two, it's worth reading the third.
B000V5TV22|5.0|I bought this GPS to use with my laptop and marine navigation software.  The directions that come with the GPS are simple, and it worked fine, right away.  It took being in an interior room, with a second story overhead to cause a loss of signal.  I intend to use this on a boat.. so that should not be an issue.  It worked with Map Tech and Sea Clear II  Running on a Lenovo T400 Laptop.  I don't know if I can update this review later, but I still haven't tested it in the marine environment yet.

B002ZG98UA|3.0|The first two films in the series had reasonable plot, believable scenes, good actors and superb choreography.  This film shows none of those.  The series seems to have run its course.
B004IDYK0G|5.0|I loved their first album and I did think that they would have to work hard to top it as it went to number one and did so well....    Well these amazing guys did not let us down with this fantastic second album. The lyrics are inspiring, deeply moving and they touch you in some way or another. I love listening to this album over and over again....    My favourite songs are Science and Faith, You wont feel a thing, This is love, Walk away, Exit wounds....    I love it!
B003L20ID8|4.0|I'm a big fan of Phillip K. Dick movies, and Matt Damon's work so I was already pre-disposed to liking this movie before I saw a minute of film. It was hard for me to see Damon as a New Yorker after all the Boston tie-ins he has had over the years. It is also hard for me to see Damon as a normal middle aged man after his run in the Bourne trilogy. To me Damon is Bourne and Boston all the time, but that was only mildly distracting as he is a very capable actor. Another aspect I didn't like was I felt the technology in the movie wasn't updated enough to fit modern day (they used books and library shelves instead of ipads and server racks). However, going for the more modern setting may have ultimately ended up a disaster and strayed too far from PKD's original story, so I'm willing to forgive them on that point.<br /><br />I did \\"jump\\" once during the movie and have one \\"wow\\" moment at Yankee Stadium, which is the reason why we go to the movies in the first place right. It took me out of my ordinary life for an hour, but also made me think about free will and destiny to the point that my brain got a bit of a work out. The plot centers around all those \\"what if\\" moments of one man's life which invariably forces the viewer to run down the list of \\"what if's\\" in their own life. The ending had more bite than I expected, and left me feeling very inspired.  As fun or dreadful as the personal \\"what if\\" thought experiment was for an hour, most of us have to go back to the same job on Monday as we left on Friday, so enjoy the ride while you can.
B003XIO7ZK|3.0|I was really excited about getting this new release. Now, I can say after listening to it several times...it's not their best work! I do believe they are missing Manni on the axe. He had a raw-ness about his playing. The sound he made in the last 10 years was very raw! Its not a bad release, but I was expecting more of the Hangman sound. Excalibur, Hangman, Grave Digger, and Knights of the Cross are without a doubt great Power-Metal from GD. I'm hoping they'll tour the USA again in the future.  I hope this helps your buying needs of Grave Digger.
0060558121|2.0|Throughout the book you see Gaiman struggling to bang the concept of old gods vs. new gods into a coherent cosmology without much success. As an idea its okay, but in the execution its pretty much a mess. Episodes of Supernatural have done the concept better, which is sad because Gaiman is very talented and he clearly has the best intentions.<br /><br />The book is rife with problems though, starting with the aptly named protagonist, Shadow. He's a shadow of a character, lacking believability and motivation, he glides through through the unreal events with barely a comment, apparently as dumb as a post and about as interesting, until his heavy handed epiphany near the end. Really he's little more than a deus ex machina. Occasionally we are told he feels something about his dead wife, but it rings false given that a patch of lichen could showcase greater emotional range. Were this to be made into a movie Keenu Reeves would be overqualified for the part.<br /><br />Even worse, the villains such as they are, are quite blah. The new \\"gods\\" are things like network television (not even cable), radio and cancer. All of which doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense. There's also a fat kid called Technology Boy who stands for new technology and the internet. Really...the internet and Wifi is a fat slob who drives a limo...yup that matches my image of Gates, Jobs and Zuckerman.<br /><br />All in all the book while entertaining at times, is a mess. For better Gaiman read Neverwhere or Sandman. It gets 2 stars only because is readable in parts and the Lakeside subplot is good and reminds me of Twin Peaks.

B003Y5H542|4.0|Going into this film I had pretty low expectations. It's released by Nickelodeon, stars Johnny Depp, who tends to be rather feast or famine, and is an animated film that's not made by Pixar. Due to that latter fact, the probability of it sucking hard went up by, oh, about 300%. So imagine my surprise when I went in and actually liked the movie!    Rango stars Depp as the title character, a chameleon who finds himself lost in the middle of the Nevada desert. A kindly, if somewhat odd, armadillo (Alfred Molina), sets him on a course that takes him to the town of Dirt. The town, which is lifted directly out of every old West movie ever made, is populated entirely by animals, uses water as a currency, has a massive water shortage, and a shortage of living sheriffs. Next thing you know, Rango has ridden to the post of sheriff on a pack of lies and finds himself stuck in the middle of something bigger than he'd expected.    There was a lot to enjoy about this movie. It's really one of the funnier comedies I've seen in a long time (and made for adults as well as kids. I doubt many eight-year-olds would appreciate Hunter S Thompson), and it's a movie that clearly knows its cinematic history (just wait until you see the Spirit of the Old West). It's also astonishingly lovely to look at. I compare the CGI in this with, say, Shrek, and the distance we've come in just a few years is really breathtaking. There were several points where I would have sworn the animals were muppets rather than CGI. They really looked good, as did the desert landscape.    Sure, I'll be the first to admit that much about the movie doesn't make any real sense, like why would there be talking animals setting up a town in the desert in a world that clearly includes humans? Why would said town be based on the old west when the movie is set in modern times? How did they manage to have things like shotguns and a Bible? But frankly I was able to ignore all that because the movie really was amazingly good!So if you're looking for a little time to kill this weekend, go see this film. It's easily the best animated movie since Toy Story 3, and one of the best comedies of the last few years.

B000NI9UMS|5.0|How many movies can both make you laugh and touch the depths of your soul?  Everything about this movie is miraculous - the directing, the acting, the costumes, the writing, and the music, the music, the music, the music...Don't bother with the Director's Cut, which bloats the movie while adding little to the plot.  The theatrical release is a work of art.
1416987118|5.0|I bought the board version of book for my son when he was 2 years old, we read it togheter many times and he loved. We moved to Brazil and I now got a hard cover copy here (one year after), he is 3 and a half now and still loves the book.<br />The story is engaging, makes the child think and now he gets really excited at the end. He learned about \\"going over\\" and \\"going under\\" things, I think the book is fun and also educational.<br />A must have I would say.<br />In regards to the versions the board book version is much smaller but very well built, it is easir to carry aroung in the back pack or in the car; if i had found it I would have bought the board version again.<br />The Hardcover version is much bigger, but the colors are shinier, and very vivid, looks better than the board version in terms of colors but is difficult for a three year old to handle when laying down on the bed.
B003FSTN6Q|5.0|I bought this dvd to go along with my collection.  I found myself getting into the show on a late start....by borrowing the dvds.  I became hooked.  I love the show and I'm sorry to see it go.  It was the one show on tv that did not show all violence.  I also love the marriage and friendships through out the series.  I hope to see other ghost whisperer items in the future.
B000JJSRNY|4.0|All three singers performed very well, although like almost all singers, they occasionally strayed a little sharp.  For sheer emotion, this DVD can't be beaten. Netrebko succeeds in giving you goose bumps, a lump in the throat and tears of happiness welling in the eyes, especially during the encores. All three are clearly genuinely enjoying themselves, and it shows in their performances.  Some of the close-up shots of the spellbound audience also tug at the heart-strings.  One of the best DVDs I have seen. Would be terrific value even at twice the price.
0061726826|5.0|I don't even know where to begin. I know I have said it in many reviews, but it has never been more true than right now: Whatever I say in this review will not do this book justice. It is an experience that you just have to have on your own. I don't have enough words to explain to you how this book made me feel, but I'm going to try to use the ones I've got.<br /><br />I love dystopia. It's hands down my favorite genre. When I heard that Lauren Oliver was releasing a dystopian book I knew I had to read it as soon as possible. I loved Before I Fall, so I knew this book would have to be great, but I didn't know it was going to be incredible. Oliver has not only created a dystopian world but she has executed it flawlessly. It has elements of Orwell's 1984, but in a much more updated and realistic way. The society in Delirium has deemed Love a disease. All the troubles of the past can be attributed to this disease. To Amor Deliria Nervosa. So, when you turn 18 you are cured. Lena has looked forward to getting her cure her entire life. Until she meets Alex.<br /><br />This book is not simply just a romance or just a dystopian. It's so much more. Lena and Alex consumed me, consumed my life for the short time that I was reading about theirs. I didn't want to let them go after the book was over. Their emotions and thoughts were so well evoked on the page that it was like they were my emotions and thoughts.<br /><br />The writing was fantastic. A book rarely ever makes me miss sleep, this one did. It was completely impossible to put down and impossible to lounge on the couch will reading. I was literally sitting on the edge of my seat. This book devastated me, but I loved every minute of it. It was beautiful and frightening.<br /><br />You might think it sounds a little dramatic, but this book changed me in some small way. I don't think I will look at life and love in the same way anymore. It's powerful. It's the best book I have ever read. And I don't throw that phrase around easily. Buy it! Pre-order it! Read it! Maybe it will change your life too.Read it! Maybe it will change your life too.

030746363X|5.0|I have found this book easy to follow and understand.  I have lost weight steadily.  Only gained two pounds on my cheat day and lost that within two days.  I also found that I am not craving all kinds of sweets on cheat day.  Inches are falling as well.  I have exercised a little but not consistently due to a injured knee.  Love the mexican dishes!  Only been on the diet for three weeks and am happy with the results.  Dropped a pant size.  Would recommend this book.
1932100660|5.0|This is a technical book. The vast amounts of technical research data and statistics compiled in this book shows the more animal products one consumes, the more likely one will develop chronic diseases, especially prostate and breast cancers, and the more wholesome plants foods one consumes, the less likely, and the reason why Americans eat so much meats and dairy are simply there are so much profits in the meat and dairy food industry and so little in the whole plants. The food regulation and guideline are heavily influenced by these profit-driven food corporations whose primary interest are to make more money for the shareholders as oppose to health of the consumers and the planet.      According to the Cancer Society's statistics, one in two males and one in three females in U.S. will develop cancers in his/her life time.     Campbell states that eating animal proteins may causes human body to release hormones that are associated with cancer cells growth and eating animal-proteins may confuse and fool one's immune system into attacking itself, whereas plants have none of these effects in additional to preventing or even reversing the diseases associated with animal proteins.

B001IF5YLQ|5.0|My favorite feature is to hook up a USB keyboard and mouse to my macbook air and then use this Apple Mini DisplayPort to DVI Adapter MB570Z/A to plug into my Dell monitor and then CLOSE THE LID and I can still wake the laptop from sleep and continue to use it like a real computer. Basically if you have a compatible laptop this product is turning your old PC monitor into a spare iMac when you want to plug it in. You could also of course use both monitors at the same time, and OSX has built in features to easily set it up however you want in System Preferences.

0061537969|5.0|I finished reading this book yesterday and it changed the way I look at the world.  Now, it's not handcraftily poetic like your \\"war and peace\\" or your shakespeare sonnets, but what it is is an amazing book with true heart and inspiration.  Upon reading this book, you feel like anything is possible.  The theme of perserverance is heavy, and with it's recurring line of \\"Where the eyes go, the car goes\\" really sinks in.<br />As someone who has lost a lclose family member to cancer, The art of racing in the rain really touches a soft spot in my heart due to much of it's story revolving around that.  At points it feels like someone has reached in and pulled your heart out.<br />My only advice to the reader is, however, not to read this book in public.  I write this because of the amount of crying I did while reading this book.  I never cried during a book either.  But moments in this story brough t tears of joy, happiness, pride, and others.  At points I was literally cheering out loud for Enzo (the dog), I felt like the boy reading the book in Neverending Story lol.<br />So, do yourself a favor, pick up this gem.  It's a quick and easy read, and it will definitely bring your sould down for refueling if that's what you need. :)

1594202842|2.0|I've read several articles about Amy Chua's memoir.  I've listened to her speak at a local bookstore.  Now I've read her book.  And I've had more than enough.  Although there are a few ideas here that \\"permissive western parents\\" might do well to consider, I'm left with just two dominant impressions.    First, Ms. Chua seems to possess one shallow, overarching value:  personal achievement.  Achievement at almost any expense.  Achievement merely for the sake of being better than others.  One gets the feeling that hers is a family in which no value exists that transcends the family itself, no value that isn't self-serving.  Can good, generous children come out of such a family?    Second (borrowing from David Brooks) Ms. Chua's Chinese upbringing seems to have left her without the skills to anticipate how her book would be received.  Her memoir isn't entertaining; it's strange and arrogant.  And it isn't humorous; the attempts at humor seem awkward and sad.  But mostly it's just grim---the mindless striving, the obsessiveness, the nitpicking, the manipulation, the broken promises, the yelling and screaming, the lack of peace in her own home, the countless ruined moments and ruined days.

0393338827|5.0|If you are looking for an easy to read (and easy to understand) book about the financial fiasco of the last few years, The Big Short is a great place to start. Michael Lewis is at his best tackling the world of high finance in a manner that reads like a novel. Instead of going after the easy targets, Lewis focuses on telling the stories of minor characters who recognized what was happening. This accomplishes a few things. It keeps the story fresh while providing the reader the chance to root for some likeable individuals. It still serves the ultimate purpose of revealing the mess that was Wall Street. This is a morality play told in a non-preaching manner. The Prologue, a reflection upon Lewis' experience working as a bond trader in the 1980's as told in his debut book Liar's Poker, may be the best -- and scariest -- part of the book. You'll know what I mean by the time you finish The Big Short. Unregulated competition in such an industry is a dangerous thing. Adam Smith's \\"Invisible Hand of Competition\\" approach won't work when the culprits are set for life before things catch up to them. To ignore that principle is to turn a blind eye to man's basest competitive instinct. I touch upon this aspect in my book [[ASIN:160239718X Compete, Play, Win: Finding Your Best Competitive Self]]. I would have liked to have seen Lewis dive a bit deeper into the motivational aspect of some of the culprits. However, that is a small complaint.
0393061310|5.0|I have read this book three times which should say something about what I think of it. I purchased it for my children and had them read it also. It is an amazing book written to answer a simple question; \\"How did European derived societies dominate others?\\" This book is the clearest repudiation of any racial basis for this than anything I have ever read. In painstaking detail and fascinating prose Diamond goes through issues such as climate and continental orientation that have influenced the way cultures can flourish. His synthesis of such a large number of scientific disciplines, the rigor of his arguments, and the fluidity of his prose are just riveting. I found it laughable that some readers complained of cultural bias in his arguments. Nothing could be further from the truth. His arguments specifically repudiate cultural biases and look at climate, animal life, plant species, and geographical features to describe the evolutions of cultures. Diamond ties in the role of disease in societies and how specialization aided by improved farming methods led to improvements in weaponry and cultural domination. He is not just blowing hot air. He supports his arguments methodically and convincingly with research results and not empty opinions.    This book is in the top 5 non-fiction books I have ever read and deserves all the accolades it has received.
1594488843|4.0|I greatly enjoyed reading Drive and found it eye opening in a number of ways. I enjoy books that challenge conventional wisdom and accepted practices. I do believe that, like most books of this nature, it is up to the reader to ascertain what rings true and is worth incorporating into his or her life and practices. Most readers should find more than a few insights that will change how they approach motivational situations be it their own or someone they are looking to motivate. Coaches, parents, managers, and anyone looking for a new take on motivation will find Drive useful. How we compete and strive in the workplace is a fascinating subject. I was drawn to this book because the original working title of my most recent book was also Drive. It ended up being titled [[ASIN:160239718X Compete, Play, Win: Finding Your Best Competitive Self]]. My book is geared towards self management in all aspects of our lives, but I found Drive to be a very interesting companion read.
B002LVVCQM|1.0|Dear Dr. Dawkins,    I admire your accomplishments as a scientist with your invaluable contribution to knowledge to enhance consciousness. But like to some of those who've given their comments here, I find the purpose of your writing a mystery. I only read the free sampler that I got on my kindle e-reader and have no wish to read any further.     As you mentioned in your book, there are two major types of theists who reject the evolution theory: the first type are those who have financial interests in maintaining creationism as a possibility; the second are those who make the first type rich through donations to empower their belief that creationism is a matter of fact, for the universe that they see will disappear if creationism is proven as false. The first type may find it useful to read your book for the purpose of preparing their argument to counter the points you raised, the other will not even dare look at your book for there's not a doubt in their minds that you've been misled by the devil and can only pray for your soul .     You said that the book is to empower those who need to defend the evolution theory against creationism. For a man of science, do you really find it rational to argue about this subject? Is there really a serious threat that belief in creationism can be accepted in schools to be considered a possibility along side scientific theories? Are there really schools worthy of attention who cannot tell exact science from inexact science? Natural science from Humanities?    From the surface, I find it inconsistent for a person of your stature to lead a relentless attack on beliefs. To think that you are not aware that the real issue here is how people develop a \\"mental set\\" that would ignore or reject knowledge to maintain belief, would be like having the delusion that I could explain the theory of relativity better than Einstein.    What then is the real motivation behind this book? Could it be just to sell for profit as any fiction novel is intended? If there are people who benefit from defending belief in creationism, is it lucrative to feed the fire in argument against it? There are atheists who would love to mock religious fundamentalism for whom this book would be irresistible. Atheism itself is a belief for no one can prove that there is no god, one can only believe that it is a possibility.     In my point of view, the possibility that this book has the convinced atheists in its crosshairs to gain profit from is more likely, than the possibility that the author is actually threatened by the popularity of the belief in creationism.    Of course this is just a mere theory, mere conjecture, or mere hypothesis, and not a \\"theorum\\" much less a fact. Facts are not claimed, they are proven with supporting material evidence.
B000002UUX|5.0|i absolutely love megadeth they are one of my all time favorite bands in my opinion this is their best and last great album most people would say countdown to extinction was the highlight of their career sell wise it was being a double platinum mega hit(in my opinion i thought countdown sucked)but were not here to discuss my opinion on countdown were here discuss my opinion on rust in peace rust in peace features megadeth first and only stable line up they ever had with marty friedman on lead/rhythm guitar and nick menza on the drums dave mustaine as lead/rhythm guitar and vocals and david ellefson as bass this line up stays the same till the year 1998 this album is mixture of melodic speed metal and awesome guitar solos(mainly due to marty friedman)they recently did a tour with slayer resembling the clash of the titans tour they did with them and many others when this album first came out where they played this entire album live pulse a few bonus songs like head crusher and peace sells i had the privilege to see them on this tour and let me tell you then they know how to put on a good show im getting off topic here lets review rust in peace<br /><br />Holy wars the punishment due: this is one megadeths best songs it deals with having wars over religion thus the name holy wars in my opinion has some of the best guitar work i heard in a long time the solo dave mustaine dose at the end is one of the best guitar solos i ever heard 10/10<br /><br />hangar 18: i can hardly consider this a song a song because its just a bunch of guitar solos with a story about how they keep extraterrestrial life forms(aliens)locked up in hangar 18 at area 51 they made a sequel to this song called return to hangar witch involves the aliens exacting their revenge on the humans that kept them there its a great song wasn't as good as holy wars but still a great song 9/10<br /><br />take no prisoners: this is one of my favorite tracks on the album it a great heavy rocker in my opinion dave sounds like a Asian woman when he sings it but i still love it still one of personal favorites 10/10<br /><br />five magics: this is a great song just has one problem its starts out heavy them gets slow then gets heavy again<br />it hate it when a band dose that(witch is one of the reasons why i dont like metallica but im not here to rant on how much i dont like metallica in here to review rust in peace)i prefer the other way around when they start slow then get heavy but after and before the slow part this song is amazing its about a book called master of five magics or something like that 9/10..........10/10 if it wasn't for the slow part<br /><br />poison was there cure: in my opinion this is the most underrated and shortest track on the album(being on 3 minutes long) it starts out with a bass line then gets into this punk speed riff that i love and ends with marty friedman doing a quicky solo 8/10<br /><br />Lucretia: this is one of the most melodic songs on the album mainly in the inrto and in martys solo its a ghost story dave made up but their is an actual woman named Lucretia(she is like some roman woman that killed Caesars son something you can look her up on google if your interested in this kinda stuff)9/10<br /><br />Tornado of Souls: believe it or not this is actually a love song your probably thinking WHAT a love song heavy metal bands aren't soposto have love a song(that was my first reaction when i heard it was a love song but its not a ballad or one of those stereotypical 80s spandex rock songs about love it is a amazing song with a awesome riff and my favorite megadeth guitar solo this song is amazing and one of the only 3 love songs i ever liked 11/10<br /><br />dawn patrol: this is a cool little song made by david ellefson it has no guitar in it only base drums and dave talking in the lowest voice i ever heard him do every time i hear this song i picture a military officer sitting back in a rocking chair reading a magazine or a newspaper 8/10<br /><br />Rust in Peace...Polaris: hell yea i love this song its about how a government will do everything and anything to maintain its power even cause a atomic war that destroys the entire human race this and set the world afire are tied for first place as my favorite megadeth song definitely the best track on the album 12/10<br /><br />rust in peace is megadeths best and last great album i didnt like countdown to extinction at all the only songs i like on that album were symphony of destruction and sweating bullets but the rest of them were just lame simple hord progressions amd stupid lyrics(i cant believe that piece of crap made double platinum) however i did enjoyed youthanasia and cryptic writings but they just wernt like classics like peace sells and killing is business i had the privilege of seeing them on the 20th anniversary rust in peace tour with david ellefson back in the band and on the show i saw with them with slayer an anthrax they played the entire album rust in peace in order from start to finish and then they played four other songs they were trust head crusher symphony of destruction and peace sells it was amazing to see these songs live after that slayer went on and played a mixture of world pained blood and seasons in the abyss i missed antrax unfortunately but it was an amazing show when i got home that night my ears were bleeding(but that was mainly slayer fault)and neck was pounding with pain cause i was head banging so hard but it was worth it i am defiantly gonna go see them again especially if they do a another rust in peace tourbr />Rust in Peace...Polaris: hell yea i love this song its about how a government will do everything and anything to maintain its power even cause a atomic war

B0039TD7PY|5.0|I grew up listening to Carole and James, so experiencing these two masters together in concert is sheer heaven. Most of these songs still sparkle and the personal magnetism of these two performers comes through clearly. Hearing them perform together is a big sigh and a smile.
0451450523|5.0|Peter Beagle's \\"The Last Unicorn\\" is one of the ultimate modern fairy tales -- the magical, bittersweet story of a little unicorn's search for others of her kind. Beagle spun a story of amazing simplicity and beauty, and it's only enhanced by the exquisitely lovely prose and the bittersweetness of the romance. What other unicorn story can evoke tat?<br /><br />A unicorn has lived happily in her idyllic little forest, until the day she hears a man say that \\"unicorns are long gone. If indeed they ever were.\\" To find if she is indeed the last unicorn, she sets out on a journey across the land, and soon discovers that the people have forgotten what a unicorn even looks like.<br /><br />But she hears a butterfly speak of the Red Bull, and how he has captured all the unicorns of the world except her. So she sets out to find the others like her.<br /><br />Along her journey, she is captured by a traveling circus, and rescued by a bumbling young wizard with illusion powers. Along with the wizard and a bandit's girlfriend, she makes her way to the malignant castle of King Haggard -- and is transformed into a mortal girl, who experiences love, uncertainty, and finally sorrow.<br /><br />\\"The Last Unicorn\\" is honestly one of my favorite fantasy novels of all time, especially since Peter Beagle managed to write such a simple, haunting little fairy tale. There's romance, tragedy, fantastical creatures, and a mythical creature setting out on a seemingly hopeless quest -- and it's all so beautifully simple and powerfully real.<br /><br />And Beagle's prose only enhances the beauty of his story -- he fills it with luminous imagery (\\"Your eyes are full of green leaves, crowded with trees and streams and small animals\\"), haunting scenes and a plot both simple and entrancing. And there are many bittersweet moments, such as a woman lamenting that a unicorn has only come to her when she's no longer a bright, innocent young girl.<br /><br />The unicorn/Amalthea herself is a pretty unique character. She's incredibly ancient and wise, but she's also somewhat arrogant and very naive about the evils of the world -- and about human emotions. Schmendrick and Molly make solid supporting characters who help the Unicorn along her journey, particularly during her time as a human girl.<br /><br />\\"The Last Unicorn\\" is a beautiful, bittersweet little tale spun out of magical prose and powerful characters.

0756404738|3.0|The book is good.  Let me say that first. Also, I think the first book is the best fantasy book I've read. But for me this didn't live up to The Name of the Wind.     First off, The Name of the Wind covered the first sixteen years of Kvothe's life, and this one only covered the next year. Not nearly as much happened in this book. For me there just wasn't enough to it. I thought it was excellent right out of the gate but the second half was a let down. So many pages were spent covering the few things that happened, and I didn't think the things that occurred (hunting the bandits, Felurian, the Ademere) were interesting enough compared with the amount of time that was spent on each. There were a few awesome moments but they were few and far between.    When Kvothe finally gets back to the University I was happy because it's so much more interesting than where he spent the rest of his time in this one, but I was waiting for a climax and this book didn't really have one. His final meeting with Denna was cool (I love all the Denna scenes) but ultimately didn't shake things up enough to qualify as a real climax    Lastly the new characters weren't nearly as interesting as the supporting cast of the first book. Tempi was great but he disappears when Kvothe goes to Ademere. The Maer and Bredon were cool as well but they play a very small role.    The first book was so spectacular that I'm just as excited for the third as I was for the second, but I don't think I'm any further along in understanding Kvothe as a character or in understanding where the plot is ultimately going in the third book. If the main character was anyone less interesting than Kvothe, I probably would have put this book down; as it is: three stars.
0765326353|5.0|I absolutely love this book. I've read it twice and thinking I might read it again although I'm not normally able to read a book twice in a row. The characters are incredibly likeable and well developed. I'm tempted to just say it's sensational and be done with it but I'll give you a little more detail than that: the development of the characters is so smooth and natural. This is, in my opinion, one of Brandon's greatest strengths, his amazing knack for developing very rich and knowable, accessible, characters. Another strength that, in my opinion, is Brandon's is his creativity, I mean...what an interesting world!!...what a unique system!...what an amazing mystery! I just cannot wait until the rest of the series comes out!! I miss the story when I'm not reading it...it's like they're my best friends, is that strange? lol
0439023513|4.0|Please pay little attention to my punctuation.  I loved the first two books no problems there but book three troubles me even after it's been two days since I've finished.  I can agree with all point of views I've read to this point and just say that I was looking for more out of Katniss.  I propose that a book four is written as a diary of her thoughts during the times of battle and torment and how she views them now, leaving us also the opportunity to find out what has happened since and how the Capitol is running things.  I still want closure and I don't believe it is to late to make an ending everybody could appreciate.  Collins could also make a third party perspective instead of a diary through Katniss' childrens eyes to full fill out need for a stronger since of independence we so missed from Katniss in the third book.

B002ZG98G4|5.0|Funny and lighhearted, Rachel Mcadams steals the show and gives a magnificent performance as Becky Fuller. She carries the movie and makes it 100 percent worth watching. Her physical comedy is also an unexpected surprise. Harrison Ford and Diane Katon star as well but do not be mistaken, this is easily Rachels movie. If you are a fan of hers, this is a can't miss role you have to see.
0670022411|2.0|This book was a fine, fast read.  A bit potboilerish, but with some interesting characters and situations in that \\"trashy novel\\" kind of way.  However, I had no idea when I started that this was first of a series, and that this entire book would lead...nowhere.  It simply ends.  I did not sign on for a series of books.  When a book can't stand on its own, even if it is part of a series, that is an unforgivable sin.
B001I82RU4|1.0|I received the vinyl LP  and when I put it on my turntable I could see it was warped and it skips in several places. I am very disappointed and I would send it back but it is going to cost more for the shipping then the vinyl LP cost me. So I am stuck with a useless LP and will probably end up buying a CD version at a later time but I will not go through the company that I purchased the LP from.
B003Q6D1YW|1.0|From the opening credits, to the intro shot of our \\"hero\\" talking with his mouth full (watching, hearing, that food, in too close, jerky photography) my stomach began to turn - I hated this movie.  I'm not sure I'd call it a documentary.  Can narcicism be a documentary?  He's right - he's not that interesting.  Oh, photography and self absorbtion, look at my cell phone, look at my ipod, look at my cell phone, see how relevant all this irrelevance is, that makes a story right?  Click.  Click.  Photo computer screen.  Ahhhhhhhhh, run, run, run.    I just fast forwarded it through it all and felt dirty having viewed it.  It's like a dull 16 year old's head.
B00005JLEU|4.0|Wonderful animation, and fantastic story.... but I sort of got annoyed with our local movie rental place as the person recommended this film for small children. Bad choice for my 4 year old. Really frightening characters in this film. A scary witch hag, a ghost with a creepy white mask, a giant baby,parents getting transformed into pigs, disembodied heads rolling on the ground. A bit of a nasty LSD trip!

B0025KVLSI|5.0|Many people say this is a filler album for The Beatles, caught in middle of Beatlemania and needing a break.  You can tell from this album cover that the mood has changed for The Beatles.  From the excitement of A Hard Day's Night to almost a dreariness among the Fab Four, this album is definaltley different.  Honestly, I really like it.  It shows some of the sophistication of the later albums but still having the greatness of Beatlemania.  The album opens strongly with No Reply and then continues with what John calls a song about himself in I'm a Loser.  Then it the quality decreases a little(but not by much)in the live staple Baby's in Black.  Then we go to possibly the Beatles greatest cover song, Rock and Roll Music.  Then we go to a favorite of mine and George Martin in Paul's I'll Follow The Sun.  Next is another cover, and also possibly the worst song the Beatles ever recorded, Mr. Moonlight.  Then we go to another great cover of Little Richard with Kansas City/Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey.  Next is the only #1 hit from the album, Eight Day's A Week.  Then are the cover tracks Words of Love, and Ringo's singing role in Honey Don't.  Then Every Little Thing and I Don't Want to Spoil the Party which is another song that shows a mood shift within the album.  Then the best song on side 2 with Paul's underrated What You're Doing.  The finale of the album is George singing Carl Perkin's Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby.  For me this is a great album that I can listen to start to finish, but that's just me.  So the only way to know for sure is to listen to the album yourself.

B003NWS5AO|5.0|This cd is one of  the best;  shows the freedom Robert Plant must be experiencing these days.  The quality of the cd is excellent because, even tho it was obviously well thought out & planned by the musicians, it has a wonderful spontaneous feel to it.  The songs are all excellent and wisely placed on the cd to give the whole cd a wonderful feel to it;  both lighthearted and very poignant.

B0017YWG2S|5.0|The melodic genious of Jobim with the silky voice and passionate interpretation of the much-regretted Elis Regina - who could ask for more?  The tracks alternate between smooth samba beat and emotion-charged ballads. This is latest and best CD of sung music I own.
B004L3AR0K|1.0|By bipolar i mean that the movie couldn't decide whether it wanted to showcase how an individual and subsequently those around her deals with a progressively debilitating disease or showcase the surface physical attractiveness of it's two stars with a backdrop of spoofing Viagra and other \\"love\\" enhancing prosthetics.  So, as a consequence the viewers' now split personality is left wandering in a zone of \\"huh?\\", \\"What is this movie about?\\"     The story was neither deep enough, believable enough or focused enough to believe in it's outcome, whatever it may be, because the movie was so scattered it just ran out of time. So the viewer is left guessing about the important issue of how our protagonists would resolve care and love within the most trying days of a disease.
030726999X|5.0|After reading the first two Stieg Larsson books I just had to read the third one.  It was as good as the first two and I wish we could have more by Mr. Larsson.  However, I know that is not possible.  Lisbeth was an outstanding character.  I really enjoyed this book.
B0021L8V0M|1.0|(1.) The MacGyver explosives and overcoming trained CIA/secret service/Russian agents were unbelievable and poorly executed even for a movie.   (2.) The running acrobatics and shooting scenes were also poorly executed and really old.  (3.) Really wooden/robotic acting and the Russian stereotypes showcase the lack of imagination in writing and directing.   (4.) Script was typical movie spy banter from writers who's experience in such a domain must consist of watching old spy movies.   (5.) Angelina needs to spend a bit of time on her fitness as hers kicks and even the task of holding a gun were all weak and shaky.   (6.) Elevator shafts and helicopters over water and unlimited firepower and the other gimmicks are just OLD!  (7.) Angelina, you should be embarrassed! I suggest donating your check to a worthy cause such as helping educate girls and women in Afghanistan.
B001KZVQJI|2.0|I just watched the extended version. It was great! Sure some scenes were over dramatized and others were a tad too long to convey a simple story elements but the beauty of the film alone makes it a 4 star affair. But this review is not for the movie, its for the disc.    When I bought the disc I read the back. It mentioned an art gallery. I thought, \\"Great, some high definition artwork to enjoy!\\". Instead viewers are slapped in the face with what appears to be abismally small thumbnails that pop up WHILE WATCHING THE MOVIE!! From what I could understand from the already terrible user interface was you had to play the movie to see the artwork in the corner of the screen. If there was another way to view them the disc fails because I couldn't find the options and I'm usually pretty savvy at finding the right button if its there.    The user interface is pretty disgusting. It might look slick but it is full of issues. Sometimes its impossible to determine what you've selected to watch, the Extended or Theatrical version, WHO KNOWS the menu doesn't highlight it properly. The U-Control idea?? Rubbish! Just let me choose at the beginning. A making of feature would've been nice.    The lack of a proper art gallery really irks me cos its part of the reason why I bought the disc. I suppose they want us to buy the artwork book seperately. Very lame and cheap of them in my book. Shame the discs shortcomings dragged the otherwise fun romp-of-a-film experience down.
B004A8ZX28|3.0|(Note: this review has spoilers so if you don't want to know them, _don't_ read beyond the first half.)<br /><br />Unknown, directed by Jaume Collet-Serra and starring Liam Neeson, is a decent thriller that keeps things interesting for most, though unfortunately not all, of the film. It had the potential to be so much more, but about three-quarters of the way in it tosses that potential aside and deflates into Hollywood cliche. A large part of the blame for this must be laid at the feet of Collet-Serra (who aside from directing music videos and TV commercials, was responsible for the hideous remake of House Of Wax and the cliche-ridden Orphan) and the hack writers Oliver Butcher (Dr. Jekyll and Ms. Hyde) and Stephen Cornwell (Marshal Law, Killing Streets), whose only real claim to fame is that he's the son of John LeCarre.<br /><br />Dr. Martin Harris (Neeson), a prominent botanist, arrives in Berlin with his beautiful wife (January Jones) to attend a conference. When they reach the hotel, Harris realizes he left his briefcase back at the airport and goes back to get it, hailing a cab driven by Gina (Diane Kruger), a Bosnian immigrant working in Germany illegally. An accident on the way back to the airport sends the taxi off a bridge and into a river, causing Harris to strike his head and go unconscious.  He wakes up in a hospital four days later with hazy memories and no identification, his passport and other documents apparently in the missing briefcase. The hospital, not knowing who he was, had not been able to notify anyone. Harris, worried about his wife, hurries to a reception at the conference, only to find that his wife does not recognize him and that there is another man with her (Aidan Quinn) claiming to be her husband... Dr. Martin Harris. And to his confusion and consternation, his wife is acting as if the other Harris is her husband while professing to never have seen Neeson's Harris before in her life. Furthermore, Quinn's Harris has identification as well as photos of him with his wife, and an internet check turns up Quinn's photo as Dr. Harris and not Neeson's.<br /><br />From that point, Harris must try to prove who he is, to himself as much as to everyone else, and to find out why his wife is refusing to acknowledge his identity. He goes back to where his problems all began - with the cab ride back to the airport - and manages to track down Gina and convinces her to help him. Then strange things start happening. People are trying to kill him and anyone he comes into contact with. He finds messages in code that make no sense but seem to have something to do with a conspiracy. And he keeps getting flashes of memory that seem real and yet are confusing and dream-like. Just who is Martin Harris? And is he the real Harris?<br /><br />The cast is generally capable.  Neeson turns in his usual first-class performance while most of the other actors are workmanlike, if not exactly riveting, in theirs. Bruno Ganz however outshines everyone else in the film in a minor role as a thoroughly unapologetic and unrepentant former Stasi (East German secret police) officer Neeson seeks out to help prove who he is. Ganz (Wings of Desire, Downfall) is truly a marvel to watch, showing how a great actor can turn what might have been a trivial role into one that steals every scene he's in. Frank Langella, a very gifted actor when given the chance (Frost & Nixon, Good Night And Good Luck), is unfortunately wasted in this film. He's played so many villainous and/or creepy characters in recent years that he's become type-cast and his mere presence is a dead giveaway that his character is not on the side of the angels.<br /><br />All in all, Unknown is a watchable if not particularly memorable thriller, so long as you are willing to suspend the average level of disbelief and don't mind its failure to rise above the level of usual Hollywood fare.<br /><br />(*** Warning - From this point on, spoilers await ***)<br /><br />A number of problems keep Unknown from living up to its potential, a big one being its sheer predictability: I had already guessed what the mystery of the two Harrises was just from seeing the trailer.  It really was fairly obvious that there was no real Martin Harris and that Neeson had only been pretending to be Harris when the accident threw a monkey wrench into everything.<br /><br />The other problems with the film generally fall into three categories: (1) characters behaving either stupidly or inconsistently because the plot requires it, (2) plot-holes and character actions requiring repeated suspension of disbelief, and (3) taking the easy, cliched way out to resolve things rather than going in a direction that the audience might not have expected.<br /><br />In no particular order, Unknown is burdened with:<br /><br />Characters with inexplicable driving skills.  One has to wonder about taxi drivers - not to mention botanists - who  somehow pull off stunts and maneuvers that would (and probably did) stagger entire teams of experienced stunt-men.<br /><br />Head trauma as a force for good.  It's been done so many times that it's almost a film cliche that a villain, having taken a good knock in the head that leaves him unable to  remember who or what he really is, somehow undergoes a personality transformation that stays in place even when he finally remembers. And so Neeson's professional assassin who had no problems whatsoever killing people in the past and was on a mission to kill new targets, is now nobly scrambling to save them.  The film would have been far more interesting if Neeson's personality had reverted to sociopathic killer when his memories returned. But then that wouldn't have given the cliched Hollywood ending the script was calling for.<br /><br />Pointless code to be solved. The whole sub-plot around the code, written by Jones, that Neeson finds in a book he's carrying is ridiculous as the only thing they're concealing is the Latin names of two flowers.  First of all, who couldn't simply remember the Latin names of two flowers? Secondly, given that Jones is using them to hack into a laptop from another laptop, why wouldn't she simply keep them on her own laptop?  And why did she bother writing them in a book Neeson was carrying?  Particularly given that when she needed them to hack into the target laptop, she didn't use the book at all.<br /><br />Convenient loss of specific items. A large part of the plot depends on Neeson losing his identification in the accident. But it also depends on him not losing the book and on having some cash.  So voila!  While being fished out of the river, he somehow loses all identification but still has plenty of cash and the book with the code written in it.  Why?  Because the plot requires it.<br /><br />Gina. So, we have a female cab driver (already a low-level probability) with fashion-model good looks (an even lower probability) who speaks perfect English (try finding one of those here!) and who continues to hang around Neeson even after it's clear that he's being pursued by professional assassins who are killing anyone Neeson comes into contact with.<br /><br />People being stupid and/or incompetent because the plot demands it.  Once their targets are no longer in the hotel room, Jones' assassin goes back to disarm the bomb.  For what earthly reason?  Because the plot demands it. And despite knowing everything about where the bomb is, how it's armed, and exactly when it's supposed to go off, she fumbles around ineptly for five minutes trying to disarm the bomb until it finally goes off, killing her and only her.<br /><br />When the shaved-head assassin goes to Neeson's hospital room to finish him off, he kills two nurses in short order, snapping their necks. But for Neeson, instead of simply snapping his neck like the others, the killer decides to tie him to a gurney and then inject some kind of drug into his IV bag which will take minutes to make it down the tube into his system.Why?  To make it seem like an accident? When he's already leaving two bodies very obviously murdered? Because the plot demands it, that's why.<br /><br />And why do the other assassins keep trying to kill Neeson in such a way that it will look like a drug accident/overdose?  They've been leaving bodies littered left and right with broken necks all over Berlin but for some reason Neeson must look like a drug death? Why? Because the plot requires Neeson must always have enough time to avoid being killed.  Stupid.<br /><br />And on top of it all, the whole elaborate conspiracy to kill a scientist by making it seem as if he was simply a bystander killed in a bombing attack on a rich Arab prince?  Why?  Again, because the plot demands it.<br /><br />All in all, Unknown was an okay thriller, but only just barely.  In the end it was both frustrating and disappointing.  Frustrating because it had the potential to be so much more; disappointing because it settled for the safe, lame and thoroughly cliched Hollywood outcome that we've seen a thousand times before.nes is using them to hack into a laptop from another laptop, why wouldn't she simply keep them on her own laptop?

0767821769|5.0|This movie never fails to move me - the actors portray REAL emotion.  Chris Columbus (Mrs. Doubtfire, Home Alone) directs with a deft hand, allowing some of the intertwined relationships' rough edges to show.<br /><br />At certain points in the film (yeah, like half of it) the waterworks start - I have to keep a box of Kleenex VERY handy.<br /><br />The reviewer who gave one star and titled their review \\"Boring\\" must have a heart made of stone (with a knowledge of usage and vocabulary to match).<br /><br />Highly recommended, insanely entertaining.  Yes, Susan Sarandon does walk away with the movie.  But that's not to discount the performances of Julia Roberts and Ed Harris, and of the children, Jena Malone and Liam Aiken, and in a smaller role, Lynn Whitfield as the oncologist.<br /><br />Plenty of laughs+lots of tears=one great film.
B003ZTQN1I|4.0|This is a great soundtrack; my only disappointment is that several of the songs are performed by someone different from the people who sang them in the movie. Faith Hill's got a great voice, but I really wanted Give In To Me by Garrett Hedlund. Otherwise, it's great songs from an incredible movie!
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|I must be going in a different direction than many other Porcupine Tree fans. I like this album and consider it to be second-best to \\"Fear Of A Blank Planet\\". I thought \\"In Absentia\\" was good but not great, and I thought \\"Deadwing\\" fell between that album and this one.    My main cricitism of \\"In Absentia\\" is that the tracks were too same-y. My main criticism of \\"Deadwing\\" is that it has some incredible tracks, but also some that feel like filler and go nowhere. I have no criticism of \\"Fear Of A Blank Planet\\". This album sounds to me like a sonic combination of \\"Fear Of A Blank Planet\\" and \\"In Absentia\\". It has the variety of the former while refusing to slack off like the latter.    Another thing that stands out to me is that, when they use the piano, they use it well. This applies not just to this album, but to their entire body of work. Piano is obviously not their focus, but it always contributes a lot when it's there -- I'd rate the usefulness of the contribution to the mix up there with what Tori Amos does in some of her work where she uses the piano as a minor player (though, obviously, Tori Amos is a far more skilled piano player and puts far more focus on the instrument in general). That is a huge compliment in my mind, regardless.
B003VSVWA0|2.0|I've been following Cohen since the late 60's. There have been albums I felt close to and those I could appreciate from a distance - writings, as well. I fell in love with the Live From London DVD and am really glad I saw it before this bit of fluff. Had I seen this tripe first, I would have closed the door.    This DVD/album is superficial and brings forth zero emotion that, otherwise, is Cohen's hallmark. Some may praise the renditions but they were flat and lifeless to this long-time friend. The pieces felt like snapshots. The backup singers, behind (although they are are a force in reality). There was little blending with the audience that, normally, catapults Cohen's concerts to the extraordinary. The album notes were banal, at best.    If you don't care for my opinion, so be it. You have yours that may differ but we both are right. For my part, this is a major pass and a severe letdown. Perhaps I expected Cohen to stay on the pedestal. This version is cheap, and a ripoff, at its finest moments.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|I loved Name of the Wind, with a dark, unholy love.  And it may be because of that that I'm simply not as wow'ed by this book.  I think that the parts that I loved most before were when Kvothe did something awesome, something amazing, and others were impressed by it.  When he's winning and is seen to have won.  Whether it's impressing people at the University - in class or in admissions, tangling with Ambrose, or... even just surviving an encounter with the Seven, it gave me a heady joy to experience it along with him.  (Note:  Micro-spoilers below.)  And in this book, there's simply less of that in some ways.  It's not that he doesn't do amazing things (Felurian, the Ademre, etc.,) it's that they're ... quieter, simpler... more boring?  There were long stretches in this book where it seemed like little happened.  In Book 1, I was living his University life along with him, and I was enmeshed.  But here, when he's traveling on the road for hundreds of pages, even though it was build-up to some exciting encounters... it just didn't catch me up.  And even at the end of that particular road (Felurian), while it started out impressive (her name), it ended up almost prosaic.  Saved only by the Cthaeh (amazing! - the equivalent of running into Halifax in the first book, but more subtle)  And while the Ademre were interesting, it was almost a long, quiet interlude.  Admittedly, I was really tired as I read most of this book.  I had a busy week, but because it was a book about Kvothe, I couldn't help but stay up until 1am, 2am, 3am, 4am reading it.  And I think I read it too fast.  I think I'll need to read it again, especially the parts I love, before I form my final impression.  And make no mistake, there were parts of the book that I absolutely, positively, totally loved.  But definitely fewer in this book, on initial read, than the first...
B003TOS8K8|4.0|This is a great album.  From the first note it's easy to hear why Ms. Spalding beat Justin Bieber, Drake, and others for Best New Artist.  Her voice is simply amazing.  The sounds are interesting and poetic.  If you're not sure whether you'll like this since its \\"jazz\\", the simple answer is \\"you will\\".  This is a great introduction to jazz.    This vinyl gets a 4 out of 5 because it fails to come with a free mp3 download.  Clearly the Heads Up record label is behind the times.
B003UESJHO|5.0|I went with my girlfriend to see the film, making an effort to convince her that this boxing themed film called THE FIGHTER was worthy of watching.  I did not expect to be utterly blown away by the amazing performances of the main actors.    The fighting scenes seemed so real, that I found people seated nearby flinching and backing onto the cushions of their seats, as Micky was repeatedly pummelled and punched, blood and sweat flying. Those that were squeamish, hunched closer to their partners, as if in fear of receiving similar blows to their sides..    The audience sat silently watching this awesome story unfold..a most touching, emotionally draining portrayal of the real life  boxing step brothers Micky Ward and a gaunt and aging heroine addict and has-been boxing champ Dicky Eklund.      For those hesitant to watch because'it's just another boxing film', well I must share there is certainly plenty of heart stopping violence during the boxing matches.  However I assure you, this is not a film only about the sport.. Mark Walhberg produced a film that is a wonderful study of the human condition, about a family's deeply entrenched with love and loyalty and over came the odds and how they brought pride and joy to the ordinary folks in small town Lowell who continue to worship their working class heroes, these two brothers.    After watching the film, I went about telling one and all to please go view this film! Word spread to as far as Japan. My friend there tells me The Fighter will premier in Tokyo on March 26th 2011. The international audience will be entertained by the portrayal of the crazy antics of this madcap family.    Christian Bale gave an amazing, incredibly generous un-self conscious performance.. My teenaged daughter whapsapped me from Canada saying 'I couldn't recognize that was Batman!'     Christian, new winner of Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, delivered so realistic a portrayal of loving but aimless older brother Dicky, having delusions of a boxing fight comeback.  Struggling to overcoming his years of heroine addiction, and finally coming clean after some jail time, becomes the story's real hero when he helps his younger brother triumph against odds to win a title match.      The Fighter is pure cinematic magic, that left the audience spellbound, as we watched in baited breath rallying through this colorful family all the way till the final scenes with the heart pounding boxing match that left me drained.  With what hardships this family went through, the glorious and exhilarating fight at the end, made the triumph all the more sweet.    I absolutely fell in love with this story, such that I had to take my dear husband to accompany to watch again. And upon viewing a second time, I saw more details that I missed in my first viewing.     All the actors did a marvelous acting in their respective roles, Melissa Leo absolutely deserved that Oscar..Amy Adams with those gorgeous blue eyes can at once be the beguiling temptress, and those same eyes can instantly change to spew firelight as she tangles with Dicky and Micky's hellcat sisters.    Finally, I wish to say a huge THANK YOU to Christian Bale..You deserved your Oscar, THANK YOU for being in a film that left my husband's attention glued to the cinema screen, and be mesmerized for over two hours, he was so enchanted by the story and your acting, he failed to notice his dear wife crying through the latter half of film. Thank you.. and I predict YOU will have more oscar nominations in the future..and a billion more fans..I will buy the video to add to my collection.
1594202842|5.0|The reviews of Amy Chua's book have undermined the story line. Far from being a portrayal of the superiority of the Chinese parental rearing over that of American rearing, it is actually a humorous take on the central character- Amy Chua reliving her life through her two daughters. This is clear through the flashbacks of Chua's childhood where she rebels against her father.  This is then altered with incidents of her younger daughter, Lulu rebel against her bringing up. This is done to illustrate how social culture attempts to influence personal values, and how their clashing is inevitable. So, if excelling at violin is a part of the Chinese culture, Lulu's rebel against playing it, and picking up tennis is symbolic to show the influence of tennis in American culture, becoming Lulu's interest.  Chua telling Lulu to give up violin in the end is not representative of the end of the `oppression' of Chinese rearing , but is rather demonstrative of the acceptance of American culture by Chua into her family life, and dealing with her own personality of perfectionism. The violin is not symbolic of oppression of chinese rearing as is made clear by the fact that Lulu wants to play the violin despite Chua not wanting her to play it anymore. And the violin, contrary to the reviews of being the only running across the book, is only a part of a bigger story here. The bigger story here is a very vivid account of a family experiencing challenges of children rebellions, doing fun things like travelling ( I wonder why no one wrote on the exquisite trips of the family to places like Barcelona, and India?), family cohesion in sorrows ( the death of Chua'a mother-in-law, where the girls prepare farewell notes and Chua's sister's diagnosis of cancer), perseverance  ( Chua's sister's Down syndrome and yet doing well) and providing moral support to each other (Chua's presence during Lulu's tennis lessons despite wanting Lulu to play the violin).  Chua's vivid account of these emotions underlying the narratives requires more attention than a reading of the reviews that give a distorted account. Chua needs to be applauded for being bold in the initiative of bringing forth such a vivid account of two generations of raising a family, where she is not hesitant to express her own flaws. Further, a reader cannot help but identify with such family experiences of joy, sorrow and perseverance narrated in a light manner. The book is definitely not about parenting skills, rather it is about family experiences and the author's dealing with her own personality in a humorous self-parody.  And for this Chua's book deserves a reading over her book's reviews.

030746363X|5.0|Thanks for all your work, Tim.  I really appreciate it.  I would like to remind people to pay attention to what is printed in the book.  I think that Tim does exactly what he claims to do in the 4HB.  He specifically says that his goal was to include that 2.5% of info that provides 95% of the results.  Remember that item before you knock the 4HB for not including some little detail that you read in \\"Good Homemaker\\" or whatnot about the correct amount of carbs to eat in a day.  Between online resources and print resources, there is a plethora of tips and opinions. That stuff is already out there and doesn't need to be reiterated.  Tim wanted to give us the 2.5% that he described.  Job well done, Tim!  Thanks!!
0307346617|1.0|I was hugely disappointed with World War Z.  As a huge fan of Zombie lit. and other science fiction genres I don't know if I was more impressed with the fact that Max Brooks was able to turn a near Zombie apocalypse into a boring chore to read about or that some people were actually able to finish this novel.      I am rarely so bored with a book that I can't force myself to push through it, but Brooks accounts of the zombie infection spreading are not only not exciting but very technical.  The book being set in a time AFTER the infection was contained took all the excitement of outcome and survival out of the story with dry and unimaginative anecdotes.  This book is more disappointing I think because it was SO promising, but such a huge disappointment.
B00406UK7S|4.0|This movie had plenty of good acting, solid plot line and a good theory behind what actually happened behind the 9th division. The story goes how Rome tried to expand it's empire into Scotland, but then was ambushed and betrayed and feel into a trap. The story, isn't too far fetched speaking since the division did just disappear when it went into Scotland. History goes that Rome only needed one 1 legion to conquer any country and keep it from revolting with the exception of England which needed 3. Rome sent in 1 legion of troops into Scotland figuring it would be the same with the same results. The Legion never returned and ferocity of the Scots and Pik's were enough to hinder Rome from ever making any advance into Scotland.     The movie does have a solid acting base, good action, super hot bad women running around. With all honesty, not a bad movie. The ending, to me, just appeared as if they ran out of money and needed to end it quick. Reminds me of M. Night Shamalan's movie's where they all just have a bad twist in it. In this case, the main actor get's back to his people and then they try to kill him. What a congrats he got...\\"Welcome home, thanks for trying your best and running for days and killing endless enemies. You look tired. Sit hear and eat while my guards try to stab you in the back\\"    But is it worth a watch? yeah, absolutely.
0446679089|5.0|This is the first Nelson Demille book I've read in many years, and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. It's the first book in Demille's John Corey series. Corey is a NYPD homicide detective staying on Long Island while recovering from gunshot wounds received in the line of duty. His friend, the police chief in the area, calls on him to \\"consult\\" on a double-murder investigation. Corey's intelligence and insightful observations make the solving of the mystery interesting, but it's his wise-cracking, sarcastic, often brash, humor that really makes this book enjoyable. I'm excited to read the rest of the books in this series, as well as checking out the other Demille series and stand-alone novels that I hadn't read before.
B0039UTDA6|1.0|Why on Earth would you want to listen to a reality talk show (if you can even call it that) queen talk about things far removed from her forte?  Over the decades, my family and I have watched all of Sir David Attenborough's nature video series (I still have some in VHS version, lol) and what makes his version vastly superior to Oprah Winfrey's attempt is--to put it bluntly and and simply--the man's world of knowledge and the infectious enthusiasm he has for the subject.  As for why Winfrey was chosen...?  Your guess is as good as mine.  But like they say...a sucker's born every minute.

B003ES5ZTG|2.0|Great idea for an HDMI cable, unfortunately it does NOT produce good results. Bought 4 of these for my new Denon surround system and liked the idea of the 90 degree plus the angle curve on these cables. Unfortunately they lose signal constantly and I had to replace two of them already. For instance, had one going to my PS3 and it would constantly drop the signal, LCD would black out and refresh till it picked up the signal from the Denon and showed it on the screen again. Same thing happened to my Blu-Ray Player. I simply pulled those cables and replaced them with the higher end ones I had pulled out previously and no problems since.

B001GWK2MC|5.0|After lots of research products like this we took a leap of faith, based off other negative reviews, and decided to purchase the item anyway. I am 1000000000000% glad we did! I didn't want to spend $150 to rent a bounce-house for my sons party so started looking for alternatives. I came across this and was torn between this and the other yellow round one Amazon offers around this price. It's great. We really love it!<br /><br />It withstood the party and is now up in our playroom for indoor days! My son 1, another 1yr old, a 2yr old, 3yr old, 2 4yr olds, and a 6yr old. They were all in it at once and there was plenty of room to bounce/play.<br /><br />As with any plastic toy you'll want to blow it up 90% of the way and give it a good 6-8hrs before use to expand and stretch around the seams. We aired it mostly up the night before the party and then completely up at the party, which was on a concrete floor with no padding, and didn't have any problems. It feels very durable unlike the cheapo pastic-y feeling pools. I would also recommend this over the yellow round one and even the one thats round and sold at Walmart because the posts help hold the weight in. So if your child loses his balance and falls not only are the walls high enough for him not to fall over, but supported by the other sides and will hold up pretty nicely. With the others it looks like they could fall out or the plastic wouldn't support someone toppling over the sides.<br /><br />I would definitely say this is not for older kids 6+. Its more geared towards younger kids who don't need to be tossed very far ;) The actual bounce piece is a blow-up mattress type thing inside the walls, you blow the base and towers up, then sides up individually, then the bounce part inside. If you're looking for something super bouncy or for older kids this is not it. The 4yr olds and 6yr old all got in it and jumped around rough-housing a bit and it held up just fine but I can't imagine older kids really enjoying it and possibly being too rough.<br /><br />I would recommend it. Amazon has a great return policy so even if you are on the fence I'd take the chance and give it a try yourself. I'm not sure why the others have such negative reviews on the product because I had none of the problems they seem to have had. Air it up about 90% and let it sit for a while, overnight/whatever, and then finish blowing it up. That's just common sense when using plastic-y products. I will write another review a few months down the line to let you know how the product is holding up. Overall we are very pleased and consider this a great buy!rough.     I would recommend it.

PB 278/246.  8\\" x 5 ¼\\". Contents eight Chaps. 4 pgs., Intro. 2 pgs., Notes 4 pgs., Recommended Books 2 pgs., Index 9 pgs. Inveiglements: one mindset cartoon.<br /><br />Author Dweck, psychology Professor at Columbia then Stanford, classified people into two mindsets, the \\"fixed\\" and the \\"growth\\" types. Dweck uses this argument to demonstrate why some people succeed and others fail. The focal point of her \\"new psychology of success\\" book was her recognition that being stuck in a fixed mindset may lead to failures, i.e., divorce, emotional rage, losing at tennis, baseball, and business (Enron, Ford, Chrysler, GE), etc., which Dweck backs up with brief testimonials or synopses from variety of sources. One of her named business heroes was Alan Wurtzel, whom you may recall declared bankruptcy (Circuit City) in 2009 after her book went into print. If you are interested in tidbits of minutiae on sports, this is a great book, providing the lowdown on John McEnroe's eventual failure as a tennis player.  (Given the right mindset could he still be #1?)<br /><br />The pages are simple to read, informative in divers sports tidbits, etc., albeit verbigerate. In addition, in my opinion, it lacks spit and polish adorning important scientific writings meant for public consumption. Those innumerable testimonials offer little: perhaps a fixed mindset editor deleted scientific data to help deny this as \\"a truly groundbreaking idea\\". In my earlier days, the well-worn and time-honored past expressions leading to success included: if at first you don't succeed, try-try again; blood sweat and tears; don't give up the ship; Occasio aegre offertur - facile amittitur; or simply, keep up the good work but also work harder!<br /><br />I know that successful people do get tired of doing the same old things and simply move on to a sport, hobby or business that is less demanding but satisfying.  Good sportsmanship does not mean you always have to win, but demands good, honest effort.  The author's promotion of practice makes for improvement or perfection is well stated.  The audiences toward which this book is notably directed are our youngsters, our coaches, and my piano teacher who was less than successful with my sonatinas.<br /><br />finisbusiness that is less demanding but satisfying.

B0021L8V0M|1.0|The main problem I have with Salt is that everything about the film is absurd (not over the top in a Hollywood blockbuster sort of way that requires suspension of disbelief...but rather completely stupid defying all logic and practical reason sort of way). There are many instances of this absurdity, which I won't get into specifically since I don't want to give away the retarded plot. I have a code of ethics after all. Suffice it to say that it is exactly the type of film where nothing is as it seems, but maybe it is...or perhaps not. Whatever! And, who cares about Russia? A cold war film in 2010?     The action sequences are quite breathtaking, but the problem is that you want Salt to die in each of them since she is so unlikable to the audience....also the stunt scenes don't just strain credibility, they snap it like a chop stick.    Angelina--a dainty precious little butterfly--is also not even remotely believable as a super soldier. This film would have you believe that Salt could take out Jason Bourne!! HAHAHA!!!! 90% of skinny pimp face teen boys (albeit post puberty) could beat the living crap out of someone with Jolie's body type. I mean if a film wants you to believe a fat ugly 60 year old woman is a hot supermodel, you'd have a tough time no matter how the other characters appear to respond to her sextastic charms. Same goes here. Sure, the 6'4\\" body builder just got his arm broken by Jolie's vicious karate chop.

B003UESJ9M|2.0|One of my biggest pet peeves with my friends and others that I talk to about movies is when they love a movie based solely on a great ending. They'll rave about some major twist, some great final sequence, but totally forget a bunch of stupid stuff prior. That being said, I am attempting not to be the complete opposite type of person while applying my same overall principle - because my instinct wants to completely pan Country Strong for what is certainly one of the worst movie endings I've seen in quite some time...maybe ever. I need to judge the film as a whole, so let's get to it then...<br /><br />Country Strong is the story of three country singers. One, Kelly Cantor (Gwenyth Paltrow), is a seasoned singer whose part Faith Hill and part Lindsay Lohan. The movie begins with her leaving rehab (for alcohol abuse), forced to leave early by her angry (or misunderstood?) husband/manager (Tim McGraw) who seemingly wants to see her back on the road making money. While in rehab, she met an up-and-coming star who worked in the facility, who coincidentally also knows another up-and-coming star who coincidentally Cantor's husband is looking into to be a new opening act, coincidentally. Coincidentally. Coincidentally. My word the beginning of this movie was almost as bad as the end. There is so much cooking here, and almost none of it is believable.<br /><br />In the middle though, once we forgive all of the coincidences, the story hits it's stride and becomes, dare I say it, immensely entertaining. The music wasn't half bad for the amount of original material they made for the film. I actually began really liking the characters - the acting was very good, and I thought I might end up liking the overall experience. And then the last five minutes happen. My word. So terrible. I'm sorry, this review is not eloquent, but it's just that bad. The screenwriter/director, Shana Feste, should be utterly ashamed how she betrayed the overall message of the movie in the last few scenes. This was supposed to be a movie about redemption, not some bad soap opera. You may not hate the movie, but I will lose respect for you if you don't hate the ending.sed to be a movie about redemption, not some bad soap opera.

Tragically, she entangles her self-discovery with her love for the eccentric Frank Lloyd Wright. The affair destroys two families and countless consequences.<br /><br />It's so easy to pass judgement on Mamah. She claims to be finding her soul and pursuing an \\"authentic\\" life with Frank. Yet, she gives up so much that fulfills her. She sacrifices much of herself and the welfare of her children and sister to simply \\"be there\\" for Frank. I'm not suggesting she should have stayed in an unhappy marriage, but I also think the scandals and desertion were cruel choices. Sometimes I debate even if she truly was \\"unhappy\\" before Frank. I think, she kind of rewrote her own history to accommodate her new love.<br /><br />That said, it's hard not feel something for Mamah. Nancy Horan writes her story beautifully. I felt her joy and her pain.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|Bought this for the original theatrical version and I love it.  It looks perfectly fine on a non-HD TV.  Basically it sounds, from other reviews, like it looks worse the larger it gets.  So just don't view it on a huge screen.<br /><br />Fortunately, all the loud protests of fans about the limitations of this product may have kept it from selling out too soon.  Now you can pick up new copies for around $10.  This is probably the least amount of buyer's remorse I've ever had with a Star Wars movie in the last twenty years (aside from the Genndy Tartakovsky Clone War Cartoons I bought as children's gifts)<br /><br />And don't look a gift horse in the mouth.  If you want to wait for George Lucas to release a cleaned up anamorphic edition of the originals, you'll never see it.  Generally if he does something, he'll use the state-of-the-art method of doing so, which takes more time and money.  Problem is, by the time he cleans, makes it anamorphic, and increases the resolution for HDTV, who knows what else he'll decide to do.  This is probably the closest thing you'll get.<br /><br />This is Star Wars.  I never felt right about all the changes.  I tried to trust George Lucas.  I thought that the changes were going to make the movies blend with the then upcoming prequels.  But honestly, the entire process of seeing the special editions of the originals and then watching each prequel just chipped away at any hope I may have had.  In my opinion these movies began a decline after 1980's Empire Strikes Back.<br /><br />There are no changes in the newer editions that added anything to the originals.  In fact, now that I've seen them again, the changes actually detract, some just more than others.  Movies are a collaborative effort of writers, directors, actors, special effects, music, etc.  In a sense, the time period and other conditions are also key collaborators.  Their contributions include their weaknesses and limitation.  Any piece of art, whether it's a painting, novel, or movie, is best viewed through an \\"historical lens.\\"  Star Wars looks only a little clunky now, so it's not at all hard to see how fantastic it looked back in 1977 and for many years beyond.<br /><br />My disappointment with the Star Wars Prequels was that we never saw Anikan Skywalker make any descent (slow or otherwise) to the \\"Dark Side.\\"  Instead he makes a rash emotional decision in the last moments of the final prequel, commits horrible but uncharacteristic acts, becomes mutilated, and is placed in a black outfit.  All the time before I imagined the suit was a reflection of the man inside, now it appears that he simple was the suit.  George Lucas just doesn't have the ability to let his characters live and make mistakes or do bad things.  That's why he had to change the scene with Han shooting Greedo, and even had Luke screaming when he fell into the bottomless pit in \\"Empire,\\" because he didn't want people to think Luke was intentionally ending his life (he removed that change later).<br /><br />I've thought this independently, and it's been said many times before, that \\"George Lucas has given in to the Dark Side.\\"  In a way, we are witnessing the drama of Anikan succumbing to the Dark Side through George Lucas.  He's become trapped in his own creation.  He can only tinker with what he sees as flaws, instead of moving on and creating something new.<br /><br />Now he plans to release all the the Star Wars movies in numerical order and in 3-D.  In a way I'm glad, because I can finally put my foot down and simply not follow this man any further.  I will never see any of these movies in 3-D.  I will probably only occasionally watch the theatrical versions, such as they are, from here on out.gh an \\"historical lens.\\"  Star Wars looks only a little clunky now, so it's not at all hard to see how fantastic it looked back in 1977 and for many years beyond.

0061537969|4.0|A family drama told from a dog's point of view? Sounds a bit odd, but it works beautifully. In [[ASIN:0061537969 The Art of Racing in the Rain: A Novel]],Enzo, the dog, delivers a lot of heartfelt and humorous truths about life and how we live it.  This book is sometimes very sad, sometimes very funny and always entertaining.
0553385445|1.0|I bought this book on an impulse in LaGuardia Airport.  I wish I had looked up reader reviews first.  I thought I might gain insight into how a Wall Street con artist could fool so many people, but instead I got an unbearable dose of narcissism and too many intimate details of this con's personal life.  If you're hoping to actually learn something, don't throw your money away on this waste of time.  I couldn't stomach it long enough to finish, and ended up tossing it rather than foisting it on another unsuspecting soul.
0312370849|4.0|[[ASIN:0312370849 Sarah's Key]] is a very moving story that weaves together a little girl's tragic tail during the round up and massacre of Jews in France during WWII and a modern day American journalist who uncovers a personal connection to the little girl. It's so easy to read and listen to stories of Auschwitz but not really get it. I felt this story.  Parts told by \\"the girl\\" were gripping and echoed my thoughts and total incomprehension as to how that could have really happened. How can one human being do that to another?
0756404738|5.0|Kvothe of the Waystone Inn continues to tell his life history as he sought information and risked his life many times over to learn information about the mythical Chandrian seven; demi deities who brutally murdered his parents leaving him an orphaned child.  Kyothe explains he entered the University, but was expelled when he alienated a noble.  From school he traveled to Vintas where he got into local politics when he learned of a planned assassination attempt.  Adem mercenaries put him on trial and he ended the terror of the King's Road.  His escapades led to the lure of Felurian the fae in her realm in which he is the first mortal to escape her seduction while staying sane.  Whether he burned down Trebon or chatted with Gods, Kyothe remained resolute that his life's work is to kill the Chadrian.<br /><br />Kvothe has seen much more than any person has ever seen; been to places few believe exists; and conversed with Gods some no longer worshipped and feared.  He knows he has become part of the mythos; but, no man can live up to the whispers of the legend they have become, not even Kyothe the wanderer.<br /><br />The second Kingkiller Chronicle (see The Name of the Wind) is a great epic fantasy starring an intriguing lead character.  Kyothe has dedicated his life to one goal, but to achieve his obsession he ends up doing a myriad of seemingly sidebar escapades; but these like his time with the Adem and his one night with Felurian enhance his skills as he prepares for the confrontation that he seeks.  Although there is repetitive emotional angst (to be expected in a tome just under a thousand pages), fans will relish more of Kyothe's adventures of how an orphan has become the most infamous wizard the world has ever known.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B003R0LBVW|4.0|yes, there is lots of hype, but there are few other novels recently written so solidly or with such depth.
B00004X01U|5.0|I admit I may have a personal bias regarding Madonna's \\"Music\\" album. Released in October 2000 and maintaining a high profile for nearly a year after that thanks to three big hit singles, this album quickly became my favorite Lady M album ever. It didn't hurt that its reign coincided with the happiest and healthiest time in my life.<br /><br />The first time I heard this album, it seemed like the perfect music for the New Millenium, even better than \\"Ray of Light\\". An excellent album in its own right, I found Madonna taking herself too seriously on \\"Ray\\", whereas \\"Music\\" is more relaxed.<br /><br />From the opening of Madonna's distorted spoken passage to the electronic blips and bleeps and stops-and-starts, the title track becomes one of Madonna's instant dance classics like \\"Into the Groove\\" and \\"Vogue\\".<br /><br />The electronica sound reaches its apex on the darker \\"Impressive Instant\\" and throbbing \\"Runaway Lover\\".<br /><br />For me, the album really kicks off with \\"I Deserve It\\". The surprisingly effective fusion of country-folk and electronica is most-evident on this song as well as the final cut, the equally beautiful and introspective \\"Gone\\". Of course, \\"Don't Tell Me\\" was a huge Top Five smash and the Thunderpuss mix may well be my favorite Madonna remix ever.<br /><br />The opening of \\"Amazing\\" makes me feel as though I'm walking through a dream until the razor-sharp guitars slash through and that irressistible beat kicks in. I know many fans call this a rip-off of \\"Beautiful Stranger\\", but I love the lyrics and Madge's delivery on \\"Amazing\\" even more.<br /><br />If I had to pick a favorite track from this album, it would be a close call between \\"I Deserve It\\", \\"Amazing\\" and \\"Nobody's Perfect\\", but the latter would win out. I can't resist the acoustic guitar break before the final chorus, when she sings \\"Cool I'm not...when I am lonely\\".<br /><br />\\"What It Feels Like For a Girl\\" is perhaps my least favorite track, being a little too bubblegum, but the haunting \\"Paradise (Not For Me)\\" makes for a good contrast.<br /><br />Unlike the follow-up \\"American Life\\", \\"Music\\" boasts some of Madonna's best lyrics and melodies and I love the production by Mirwais. \\"Music\\" remains my favorite album of hers over a decade later.unting \\"Paradise (Not For Me)\\" makes for a good contrast.<br /><br />Unlike the follow-up \\"American Life\\", \\"Music\\" boasts some of Madonna's best lyrics and melodies and I love the production by Mirwais. \\"Music\\" remains my favorite album of hers over a decade later.
0646497855|4.0|Good book to help you prepare for the IELTS writing exam. There are numerous tips on planning and developing structure. The book also features a number of sample exercises which you can use to practise. Clearly written with the most important information highlighted.
B000002AS3|5.0|17 years later I still find myself reverting back to songs like Slide Away, Live Forever, Married With Children and Columbia just so I can reconnect with the magnificence of this album. Truly a timeless masterpiece.
1439102724|5.0|I have just spent two days reading Sing You Home and came directly to the computer to review it.  I had kind of soured on Jodi Piccoult after a few decent reads.  I thought The Pact was absolutely phenominal, Sister's Keeper a cool idea, but by Handle With Care the writing had become formulaic.  Not so with Sing.  It is an amazing commentary on life as we know it, today, this very minute, affecting us, people we know and care about.  Of equal importance is that my job requires me to face 20 students at 7:30 each morning and yet I was up until 1:00 a.m. because I couldn't stop reading.  I don't have the money, or the time, to waste.  If you don't, either, then this is the book for you.  Get it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I haven't had TV reception of any kind since 1999, so I missed this when it was on the air, but it was tossed in with a bunch of DVDs we borrowed from some friends. We had no idea what it was, so we were in no hurry to watch it and it sat on the shelf a while. When we finally got to it, we watched it all in like two days. Each episode just sped on by, seemed like it lasted like five minutes. It was simply a crime to cancel this show and even more so not to even air all the episodes that were made. Of course, I had to have it for myself so it could be watched on a whim and repeatedly. Bought it on Amazon coz the price was shiny!
B0032JTV6U|5.0|We didn't start watching Glee until the last half of the first season.  This is the COMPLETE first season and brought us up-to-date on the who/what/why's of how the Glee Club was built.  We thoroughly enjoy watching without \\"commercial interruption.\\"  It had us hooked from Episode 1!!!
B004DK5CW4|5.0|I absolutely loved the movie.  Secretariat was one of those magic horses, that seemed to know exactly how the people around him were feeling.  I loved the relationship between Penny and Secretariat, they had a true bond.  He was a unique horse that comes around once in a lifetime.
B004M4VSYW|5.0|Brilliant! James Franco is incredible and the story is not just about a guy cutting off his arm, it's very inspirational! Sad that many people have yet to have seen it, definitely watch it!
0670022411|5.0|I just want the average person that is buying this book to know that a lot of the negative comments against the book is it's price...personally, I don't think it's outragous...I bought a used copy.  Anyhoo, the book is fun...it was a book I had fun reading.  It's been a long time since I've read a book that I've had a hard time putting down.  I thank the author for writing a FUN read.  Bravo...I can't wait for the next one;)
B0042X9L6A|1.0|I bought this to use off camera on a flash bracket.  I also bought an SC-29 cable.  The plan was to use the SB-700 off camera on the flash bracket and in the future us it as a master for other remote flashes However, according to the SC-29 manual \\"The TTL auto flash is not available\\" What use is the cable then?? I know I can use commander mode on my D70s but that won't give me the AF-assist.  Further, commander mode won't set the SB700 to master mode.  I wish I had not bought any of the \\"stuff\\"    R
B001PB3RU8|4.0|I have listened to this album three time in as many days. I love her!  I caught myself turning up the volume, trying in vain to hear her over the deafening percussions, only to be painfully reminded we haven't the technology to ONLY turn up the vocal track!!  Who mixed this thing?  Maybe Florence should sit with the harpist and do it without the 'rock stars'. I want to hear her, not the back up band.  I would have rated this a five, except for the over-bearing percussions.
B004HWR406|1.0|This movie is awful. I do not understand why anyone would rate this more than 2 stars. The acting is good, but the story is slow and boring. Save your money!!
B002RD4UZ4|5.0|I happened to come across this album while looking for something new.  I enjoy Diana Krall and Norah Jones, although I haven't been too impressed with their newer albums. I am a fan of great female jazz vocalists like Ella, Billie, etc. After listening to this album, I'm glad that this is alive in Melody Gardot. I really enjoyed listening to this album.
0756404738|3.0|I have been waiting for years for this book.  I love Patrick Rothfuss - I loved his first book, I love his blog, I love hearing him speak in person, I love his charity work... I'm just a huge fan all around.    That said, I was disappointed by this book.  It was a good book - but not nearly the quality of The Name of the Wind.      As others have mentioned, the story just isn't as tight as NOTW.  The \\"worst\\" part of NOTW was the trip to Trebon to and the killing of the draccus, if only because it seemed to drag on far too long.  Each of the segments of this book have a smiliar quality to them.  The University segment was long, but that moved along at a good clip.  The time in Vintas dragged, as did the hunt for the bandits.  The time with Felurian also seemed to drag on and on... and then, the time with the Adem.  The part that made each of those segments difficult to chew on was the fact that Kvothe did not progress as a character.  At the end of WMF, he knows how to make love and he is a decent swordsmen (not nearly as good as the legendary people who trained him).  That's all that could be accomplished in 1,000 pages?  Really?    If this was to be a 4-5 book series, I could buy this as a decent book two.  I can't fathom how the series will end with one more book.  Either Kvothe isn't as cool as the NOTW made him seem, or book three is going to get about 85% of the series' action in it.  Too much of the story remains untold.    This is not to say the book isn't a pleasure to read - Rothfuss' skill as a wordsmith ensures that the story remains interesting (or I probably would have put the book down).  Perhaps the buildup to WMF was too great - perhaps I cared a little too much about a literary character.  However, I can honestly say I was disappointed - it reminded me of my disappointment at reading A Feast for Crows by George RR Martin a few years back - a good book, but a letdown after A Storm of Swords.      Let's hope Pat Rothfuss and Kvothe recapture the magicin Doors of Stone (or whatever the title ends up being).
1419553429|4.0|The verbal part of this book is good, but the quantitative one is not that advanced as the title suggests. I used several books to study for the GMAT and the ones I like most were the Kaplan Premier 2011 (good for tips, introduction and exercises) and GMAT the official guide (good for tests similar exercises as the real exam).
0756404738|5.0|The Name of the Wind was one of the best books I have read in recent years, and now I can add A Wise Mans Fear to that list as well. Yes the second book is slow, but it still held my interest all the way through. Kvothe finally leaves the university and puts his skills to use, and finds some new ones along the way. We also start to see glimpses of the man behind the legend, and that he might not be as powerful as we were lead to believe.  Even though we are 2/3 into Kvothe's story there are a lot of questions left to be answered, and I can't wait for the third book.
0470449748|5.0|It is a very good book with real examples, but I found that other books may help with better tips for the exam. I really like mathematics and prefer to solve exercises than to use replacing numbers techniques, but I found that, for many of the GMAT exercises, the latter is the best way to have time to go through all the exercises.  I used several books to study for the GMAT and found that the most efficient are; Kaplan Premier 2011 (good for tips, introduction and exercises) and GMAT the official guide (good for testing similar exercises as of the real exam).  The Manhattan books are also very good, but can be used to strengthen specific parts and for giving access for 6 online exams.
B002BPQ0Y2|1.0|this group sucks!!!!! the super bowl half time show was proof enough! and no i dont agree this is good enough for a drive in my new mustang...this crap will never get the chance to play on any of my sound systems!
B0048LPRD2|1.0|If you enjoy seizures then this movie is right for you. It starts out a little interesting but the plot and entire movie sequence doesn't make sense. I found myself wishing it was over and I had to constantly cover my eye's due the bright annoying light show that would occur about every 5 minutes. Maybe if you were really blasted stoned out of your mind you would enjoy this movie, which it seems to me like the creators were. Save your time and do not enter.
B000005S6B|5.0|This is the best CD! I head the initial music as the background for a car commercial,(the one with the mom taking the kids to hockey practice) and had to find out what it was and who did it. Did a little digging and found it to be \\"If I Should Fall From the Grace of God\\". I ordered the CD and then discovered the Pogues. They are great! Liked everything on the CD and love the Irish brouge.
0762188618|5.0|Good thriller notable for picturesque and spot-on descriptions of small town British life. Prose is skillful and interesting.     [spoilers]    The weakness of the book was Lucy Rose's sabotage attempt on the jeep. She was supposed not to be expert at machines - she would never have considered the pointless booby trap that she tries at the end. Since it barely slowed up Faber, it's not clear to me why it was put in there at all.     Other than that, the book was interesting and difficult to put down. In fact, it got me started reading a bunch of other Follett books (none of which so far, however, have been as good as this one).
B00371QQ2U|3.0|One of my favorite movies ever, so I was excited to buy it on blu-ray.  It works pretty well, but you cannot pause or stop the movie once you start, because it will go back to the main menu every time.  Blu-rays should work much better than this.  I would have bought the DVD instead and saved the money if I'd known it would work like that.

B004OYDVT0|5.0|This album is simply amazing, but don't pay $34.99 for the deluxe edition!  It's $11.99 at Target!  It's 4 extra tracks on a separate disc, the exact same ones as listed here.  You may even find it cheaper, I got it on sale for $9.99 - I don't know if it will go on sale again or not.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|John Malkovich and Morgan Freeman have a habit of stealing every scene they are in.  Remarkable to see an actress of Helen's caliber playing the balistics expert she does in this movie.  Action?  Check.  Funny?  Check (see John Malkovich in first sentence)  Moments of poetry?  Check (see Morgan Freeman in first sentence).<br />Oh wait.. there's that \\"Die Hard\\" dude too... what's his name?  Oh yeah, Bruce Willis.  Even though the film centers on Bruce's character, the support cast is so perfect in this film that you could have cast Homer Simpson as the lead and it would have been a good movie.<br />A worthwhile edition to any action/comedy junkie's collection.  For the rest... worth seeing at least once... say the digital version?
B003XCVQ3C|5.0|This thing works perfectly, i plugged it in my macbook pro(mid 2010 version) and was watching movies on my big screen no problem with sound. This is perfect for me being stationed overseas & able to watch US shows & movies on the big screen via my macbook pro.
B0043RSJ8G|4.0|This is the first time I've read a book with accompanying music. Kindle does not support the music files, but the contents can be listened to in an iPod, and there's also a website where one can listen to the songs. These songs were strategically placed throughout the book for the readers to listen to and better relate to how the main character (Zoe) was feeling at that point. The lyrics and the melody and the singing were all so very good that it was not so hard to imagine that it was actually Zoe Baxter who was singing.     I have two favorite songs - The House on Hope Street and Sammy's Song. After Zoe's husband Max said, \\"I can't do us anymore\\", signaling the start of their separation/divorce, the chapter ended and the reader was directed to the song \\"The House on Hope Street\\", where Zoe sang about the house she and Max lived in. Even though imperfect, it was the place she thought \\"they would grow old\\" in. But yet it seems that nothing is perfect, that \\"beginnings have to end\\".     On the story itself, it is a different theme altogether that Jodi Picoult tackled in this novel, and it is really a welcome relief from the very similar plots of her more recent ones - Sister's Keeper, Handle With Care, House Rules. The common elements of a Picoult novel are still there - family issues, courtroom drama - but I'm not complaining, as these are what made me a fan in the first place. Nice work!
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|This movie was not even close to the same caliber as Band of Brothers. It is poorly written, boring, hard to keep track of what's going on.  There is no lack of male nudity which definitely takes away from the movie.  To be fair, I stopped watching the series half way through on account of not wanting to see any more full frontal nude body shots of men. Tom Hanks, is there something you want to share with us?
B004P4S4NM|5.0|I have been listening to this CD NON-STOP since it's release.  Adele is pure talent!  From the lyrics to the vibe of the music, you feel it deep within your soul.  A fresh, lovely and welcome break from the what-the-heck-is-that-crap?! that floods the airwaves.  You will not be disappointed with this purchase!
B001SWQYGI|5.0|I received it within promised period and in good condition.  Excellent sound quality and the output level is high enough to drive a headphone easily.  I am using it to have multiple output from my PC.  One output is connected to PC amplified speakers and I have a headphone connected to another output and use the individual volume control on this box to control which output be active.  Overall I am very happy with sound quality, output level, and its construction.  It is in a metal chassis.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Although the case was sealed nicely and protectively in plastic cellophane, once opened, the disks have to be slid in and out of each section which, of course, makes it more easily to scratch as you must use you fingernails to get them out.  The slit they each fit in is very tight cardboard making it difficult to extract them and put them back away.  The manufacturer should have used the traditional way of having each mounted in a circle to pop out.  I can forsee a problem with them in the future because of this. Obviously, it was cheaper for the manufacturer to enclose them this way but, eventually, the cardbord slits will rip and the disks will get scratched, no matter how careful you are.    This reminds me of the ESTHER WILLIAMS set I purchased where the disks lay partially on top of each other and had to be pulled off allowing it to rub against the disk underneath it.  For that reason, I removed each one and placed them in a separate case to prevent that from happening.  But after paying the money, who feels that they should have to do that.  That the disks aren't safe in the case they were housed in.    I was very disappointed that such a great series like Spartacus was relegated to such cheap housing of the disks.  As for the ESTHER WILLIAMS collection, it is a xhame that the disks cannot be taken out and put back without fear of their being damaged.
B00318COS4|4.0|Very fun and interesting game. I really enjoyed the humor exuberated by the main character with his many mannerisms. Watch him when as he is idle (don't move your mouse) for many surprises. The only downfall of this game is it is too short. Five hours without a walkthrough, which did come with the product, is less than what I expect for this caliber of game. Outside of that, I hope for a sequel that is eight times longer. I consider a 40-hour game in my challenge range.
B001BNFR6W|1.0|Each season in this boxed set has numerous defective disks.  Some freeze, some won't play at all.  Very disappointing and frustrating.  Amazon customer service was exceptional, however, and allowed the return of this defective product even after the 30-day refund period.  Since then, I have ordered the \\"Will and Grace 1-8 Seasons Bundle Pack\\" from one of their independent vendors and am extremely pleased with the service and, more importantly, the quality of the dvds.  The individual seasons just take up more room on the shelf ... small price to pay for having the shows play smoothly!
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|24 in my opinion is the most exciting TV Series i've ever seen and I hope they  make a 3 hour long movie of it.     Great Job  Chuck
B0031RAOW8|4.0|This IS NOT an action-packed movie.  There are no multi-million dollar special effects.  It's a slow and methodical story, based upon true events, which portrays the dogged (pun intended) loyalty of Hachi.  I believe that the true story occurred in Japan, but for purposes of this movie, the story was \\"transferred\\" to the U.S.  If you're looking for action, this is NOT your movie.  If you're interested in a story about the connection between man and dog, it's a great watch.  There are moments that will bring tears to your eyes; well, if you're human!
B002JVWR9U|5.0|It was a great first season. I had seen it before they came out DVD and these are ways to remind you what happened last season. I get to see how the characters started out and how they have grown. Truly for anyone who loves this show it is a must have!
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|Gary Taubes did a good job challenging some of my long-held beliefs about \\"health\\" foods. For years, I have exercised 5-6 days per week, while consuming the so-called \\"healthy\\" diet of high carbs and low fat. After age 35, calorie counting also became the norm for me. I have not considered myself a dieter because I have managed to maintain a healthy weight, given calorie restriction and a high level of exercise.       I began reading Gary's book with the assumption that he was going to recommend calorie restriction through carb reduction. I quickly realized that his book was not the calories in/calories out model. His discussions about hormones really started to make sense. Mr. Taubes's summary of research challenged me to evaluate the sugar content in the minimally processed foods that I typically purchase in the organic section. Half way through Gary's book, I realized that even without eating cookies or candies, I was consuming a low-fat, steady sugar diet.       I have incorporated several of his findings in the last few weeks such as actually increasing my fat and protein consumption. I don't eat bacon like the author, but I have been adding a little fat (olive oil/butter) to vegetables, eating more protein (vegetable and animal), and I have generally not worried as much about calories. I have dropped several pounds, but the biggest change has been that I have not been experiencing strong cravings for sugar or feeling constantly hungry. I recommend this book for anyone who has fallen into the pattern of high carbs/exercise/more carbs without the desired results. Gary's review of the impact of frequent exercise on hunger and eating patterns will be of interest too.
B003Y5H53S|1.0|Read the other reviews ...(but five stars? really?)  I'm just weighing in that we didn't love it (and only one person in my family even \\"sort of liked\\" it).  Big disappointment for us.  Animation is very good, and that was about all.  Movie was just bad, and boring.  Humor was crude, and not even funny.  Has a string of mild profanities to include 31 flavors of \\"hell\\" which didn't do anything for me or the film.  We're sorry we wasted our time and money.  If you just have to see it, wait for the Redbox rental.
B0042RUMG4|5.0|This album is as good as regular kanye. Every time he came with new music (with \\"new\\" i also mean different) he does it with quality and always with a few surprusises and WTF moments.  The movie is intresting, nothing to die for. I presume it's on youtube so you should take a look at it before you buy this version.    Plus it has POWER the best song of the year!
B003XKPPOU|4.0|I think Toy Story 2 is my favourite, but we love them all and enjoy them on family movie nights regularly
0802473156|5.0|I recommend that everyone read this book or have it read to them. The insight to a good relationship is in the reading of those pages.  It does not matter what one's previous understanding of love and relationships is. The knowledge in this book will clarify or enhance your love (or any) relationship.
B000AQJPQE|4.0|Our son is 4 and is crazy about planets and space. He's been able to name the planets, in order, since he was 3.  We love this toy as he can watch the planets go round as he falls asleep. It is silent (not sure what the noisy reviews are talking about) and once installed it is great.  My husband had no trouble installing it. Yes, it is delicate, but just be careful!  Once installed it is out of reach, so not an issue. We love it and recommend it for those young budding astronauts out there.
0765326353|5.0|This is one really really good book. The thing I like most about it so far is the fun I have re-reading it. Most books I have to sit on the shelf for a few years until my memory fades enough to make it enjoyable again. Not Way of Kings. I have re-read this book probably 10 times since I bought it. While the new world is strange and has alot of elements, it doesnt take very long to switch your realities and sink into it. I will be standing at the bookstore the day book 2 is released to snatch it up as quickly as I possibly can. Great Job Brandon Sanderson. You are the best new writer in a time where there are many good new writers. Although you wont be considered new much longer as quickly as you are releasing books.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Definite favs after a few playbacks but excellent f/u to freshman effort that exceeded most people's \\"best\\" efforts. Probably won't get a lot of radio play; but then radio is half dead anyway. Doing mucho hits online already.  Nice mix of styles & co-writers and left me hoping for more. I also got an incredible price by buying pre-release on Amazon !!!
0756404738|1.0|The plot doesnt move at all from book 1. At the end of the book we are still at the University. There have been no rescued princesses, no king's killed, no battles, nothing that gives you any relief from the monotony of an ignorant kid chasing after a known prostitute who is so mixed up and twisted she would be better off dead in an alley. The parts that are anywhere close to exciting and interesting could be summed up in a couple of sentences. And they were so far from exciting and interesting I wouldnt even bother summing them up. Very slow, boring, story that left me depressed and disappointed. Wasted 3 days of my life reading it. I guess you could say he did a good job with literary functions but since I am not a college professor I could NOT care less about that. Book bombs in my opinion and to think the inside book teaser shows so much promise, how will he fit all the excitement in one final book?
B001FB55I0|4.0|Terminator Salvation is a good re-visit to the past.  Good but not great.  A GREAT re-visit to a bonafide franchise is Die Hard 4.  Director Len Wiseman understood the material and seamlessly generated an explosive next chapter.  This is where Terminator Salvation falls short.  It borrowed too generously from the past and relied too heavily on editing to make it nothing more than a better than o.k. sequel.   Worth a watch but a missed opportunity for sequel greatness.
B00008CLOA|5.0|I was never a Pink Floyd fan and still don't really find their music all that inspiring or noteworthy.  That said, the recording quality of this album is amazing, I have around 20-30 SACDs and this is easily the best sounding.
B004I2K4DY|2.0|I admit it is unfair to hold the 10 year Anniversary Concert as a standard. Those performers were all top notch, and the execution near perfect for a live performance. That being said, the 25th Anniversary falls far short. Nick Jonas is an embarrassment as Marius. His voice is not that great and his acting worse, the same expression used for the entire performance, like he was experiencing gastric pain. He should stay away from the theater and stick to singing for 12 year-old girls who have no discriminating musical taste. ValJean and Javert were decent performers, but in my opinion neither possessed the powerful voice required for their roles. Bring Him Home was the best performed song, the higher pitch of the song seemed to be in singer's wheelhouse more so than the rest of his numbers. The girl who played Eponine appeared to have a strong sweet voice, but she spoke more than sang, clearly annunciating each word at the expense of her singing. Even Lea Salonga as Fantine was disappointing - she seems to have lost the canary-sweet voice that she had 10-15 years ago.    I will say the video and audio quality were excellent (Blu-ray). The big chorus numbers such as At The End of The Day were also good. I am waiting for the day when the 10 year concert is remastered and released in 5.1 audio, however with the 25th just coming out now, I don't expect that to happen anytime soon (if ever).
0670022411|5.0|Warning: do not start this book in the evening if you have to get up the following morning    I'm one of those extremely picky fussy readers who think most genre fantasy and romance are sloppily written with superficial characters and clumsy plotting. Hence I have great difficulty finding new authors.      I agree with much of what is already written in the other favourable reviews. I just wanted to add a small gloss on what others have written. Hence I am not going to recount the story or the people in it.  Other reviewers here have done so.      The characters in this book are great. If you love character driven adventure, you'll love this book. If you like excellent writing and immaculate world building, you'll love this book. This book is at the top of its' genre. If you know any extremely literate people who are suspicious fantasy, urban fantasy or romance, this is the book to get them swiftly addicted.     Some reviewers complained about the length and the pacing. I found the opposite to be the case. The way the book is written, between intense moments of violence and conflict, you spend a lot of time with the characters, including a fair amount of \\"down time\\" where they hang out, discuss wine and food and go to yoga class. This is where they have great conversations. The get to know each other (and much of the plot develops), and we get to know them and their complex, rich,  immaculately built world. It was an absolute delight. I would have been pleased  had the book had been much longer.     Like some other reviews I am vacillating between grumbling about the wait for the next book, and rereading it from the beginning, having just finished it about 5 minutes ago. This is very rare for me.    Here's hoping this is the first of many many fiction books from Deborah E Harkness.
B001GKJ2FW|3.0|This is a musical first and foremost, make no mistake; it has beautiful scenery, an amusing story line, and lots of music and dancing. If you're into that sort of thing this may well be one you'll like.<br /><br />I would suggest you rent it before buying as it falls into a distinct genre of movie. Several younger members of our family recommended it to us and we watched it and found ourselves fast forwarding through a lot of the songs. I'll admit they did enjoy it so you may well enjoy it too; just watch it first and get a feel for what you would be buying.
B000SO7OM0|5.0|This DVD/CD combo is FABULOUS! Watching Loreena and her wonderful musicians perform is such a treat in itself, and to be in such a setting as the Alhambra! WOW! It's great to be able to put the DVD on at home or listen to the CDs anytime in the car. The scenery, the commentary by Loreena, all the favorites of her music - what a package! Terrific!
B0038BBA4I|4.0|Great artist, great voice.  But for Little Lion Man, he could have used 'screwed up' instead of \\"f$&$^ up\\" and the song would have been as good, if not better.  There's really no need to curse.
B000T0XEGS|5.0|Love, Love, Love this movie/opera! Zeffirelli makes opera come alive with his unique way of filming and Stratas, Domingo and MacNeill draw the viewer into their heartrending story. This is the movie that 1st opened the opera world for me several years ago when I saw it on PBS. Beautiful scenes in the country & on streets, as well as the lavish Parisian home, make one feel a part of the story, not just a spectator of a stage production. The english subtitles are the icing on the cake, enabling one to understand every moment of emotion & drama. I am so grateful to Franco Zeffirelli for the gift of understanding opera!
1846142733|5.0|This book is for anyone who loves history. It is an eloquent defence of our civilisation's values, and also an impassioned and compelling argument for why the study of history is so important and is a vital discipline. It is not a matter of agreeing with every point Professor Ferguson makes, although his arguments are very convincing and it is hard indeed to see how to disagree. This book raises a question, which is how the West has achieved predominance over the rest of the world, and, by extension, how it can possibly maintain that predominance if it loses the features which made it so successful and which are being adopted by its rivals. It is a cultural analysis backed by historical evidence, and it is deliberately provocative even in terms of the question posed, not to mention the answers provided. The main value of this book is not, however, its all-encompassing sweep of world history and rich collation of stories and anecdotes, although that is what makes it so much fun to read and saves it from being boring (which many good books are). Professor Ferguson's virtue is that he does not sacrifice intellectual rigour in order to engage the interest of a non-specialist. As an economist as well as an historian his analysis is underpinned by serious scholarship that is not easily accessible to the layman, yet he vigorously challenges the established conventions that are characterised by complacency, presumed even-handedness, and relativism. Professor Ferguson is magnificent at marshalling a wide range of knowledge to support his opinions. It is what history should be all about. This book is an incisive analysis of the past which aims to stimulate debate. It is a reassessment of our assumptions that have a profound impact on the present, and of course also on the future.
B000094HMU|4.0|Another excellant production of Zeffirelli; color, sets, costumes! Superb! Domingo was absolutely perfect in this role. Mitchell was so beautiful, her voice rich, haunting, poignant. Marton's voice wonderful, though I felt her makeup wasn't quite right and her acting stiff. James Levine, always a joy.
0307474275|5.0|I am not much of a reader but this book grabbed me instantly. Not only was it upbeat the whole time, it was interesting enough to keep me from getting bored. Another thing I really enjoyed about this book is that it intrigued me to an extent, but not enough to keep me up at night. Reading The Da Vince Code didn't seem like a punishment for me to read like other books because I enjoyed it so much. All of the different characters coming together really summed up the confusing parts in the book. This book included historical nonfiction and it also included fiction. The book took many turns and the unexpected events happening made it much better. I actually learned from reading this. I would definitely not base my spiritual and religious beliefs on this book. Dan Brown is an amazing author to have thought of a novel like this one that captures the readers attention so quickly. I would recommend reading this novel 100% to anyone. Although I am not much of a reader, I will not hesitate to pick up another book by Dan Brown.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|This is a very cute movie about a good-hearted teenager helping out a friend who's being picked on in school with a little white lie that led to another lie, and another -- until the situation totally gets out of her hand.  I think a lot of teenagers can identify with the characters in this movie, all very well casted, written, and directed.  This is rated PG13 and it is about teenage sex (no, there's no nudity.)  But beyond that, there's an important message here - that you shouldn't believe everything you hear.  If you have pre-teens, you might want to view it first before letting them see it, but my guess is that they will see it somewhere else anyway.  At least if you watch with them, you might get a conversation going.  Surviving high school is never easy, but if you talk to your children, at least they'll know they can talk to you -- and that's a very good thing.
B00004TWZF|5.0|this is an absolutely great movie, that if your not watching with a smile on your face, your just not gettin it. I will say however, you truly want to have the version with the Bill Conti music score. I have the Dvd long version with the Eric Sierra music score (which sounds like elevator music), and besides it being long,drawn out, the shorter version with Conti score is the way to go. I love this movie so much that I also bought the VHS version cause of the music score, it just makes it so much more appealing. Treat yourself to a wonderful two hours, and watch this movie. 99.9% of you will be glad you did, the other .1%, breath!
B003L77TZI|4.0|Katy Perry would like us to make the most of our lives and have a good time doing it. Is that so bad? Not to me. Is it attainable these days? Maybe not, but a little escapism won't hurt you. On this album she throws the listener into an idyllic world of a \\"teenage dream\\", where \\"California Gurls\\" wear bikinis and \\"skin-tight jeans\\"; where we can \\"be young forever\\"; and where on Fridays everyone indulges in escapades such as dancing on tabletops, maxing out credit cards, streaking in the park, and skinny-dipping in the dark. In \\"Firework\\", Katy asks, \\"Do you ever feel already buried deep?\\", and then assures us that we \\"just gotta ignite the light, and let it shine...'cause baby you're a firework, come on, show 'em what you're worth.\\" Some of her \\"gurls\\" are pretty advanced in sexual matters. They demand that their guys show their peacocks, on Fridays they have m&eacute;nages &agrave; trois, and they can't stand it if the guys can't stay awake through foreplay because they take too many pills. (Hmmm. Maybe things aren't that idyllic in Katy's world after all.) Anyway, further encouragement to live and live well is found in \\"Pearl\\", as Katy sings about a girl who \\"used to rule the world\\" and advises her that \\"you are strong...you can still go on.\\" In the ballad \\"Not Like The Movies\\", she claims that \\"if it's not like the movies, that's how it should be, yeah.\\"<br /><br />I am not belittling Katy's message; I enjoy her album very much. It takes me back to freer, more hopeful times, and the sexual frankness is a bit of a turn-on. But all of this would be pointless if the presentation were not good musically, and thankfully, that is not the case. Katy sings the lyrics with great gusto and enthusiasm. She's young, after all. Her natural, girlish voice adds just the right amount of naïvet&eacute; and a quality of urgency, as if to say, \\"Come on, don't think about it too much, just do it!\\" The relentless beats move us forward along with her. The musical arrangements are bright and decorative, as pop should be. The competing strands of staccato synths in \\"Firework\\" are downright irresistible to me, and \\"Hummingbird Heartbeat\\" sounds like the 80's Madonna hit that never was. I find this determined joyousness to be an attractive antidote to the unceasing pressures and sometime bleakness of today's real world. I'm glad we have Katy Perrys to remind us that we should remember to enjoy ourselves. So, watch the video for \\"Firework\\", and imagine that you are in the crowd at the end, following the leader (Katy, who else?) to a wonderland of happiness and fulfillment.should be.

0756405890|5.0|I read fantasy (GRRM, Jordan, etc.) regularly and am always looking for the next great series and this first book appears to be the beginnings of just that.   I plan to reread it and then dive into the latest installment (Wise Man's Fear).
0670022411|1.0|I downloaded the first chapter as a sample and - after reading just a few pages - bought the book and moved it to the top of my reading list.<br /><br />What a disappointment. Harkness has certain charm that occasionally shines through in her writing, but the story is a mess. Villains appear and lurk in the shadows. The heroine goes rowing. Twice. She goes to yoga a couple times, too. The villains multiply. The heroine goes horseback riding. Three times. Then she learns to make an herbal tea.<br /><br />Oh, and she falls in love. With a vampire, of course. Annoying \\"mon amore!\\" crying love. Eyerolling, \\"Will you ever stop surprising me, mon coeur?\\" kind of love.<br /><br />Then the heroine discovers her powers. Naturally, she is the most gifted witch in generations. Here is a partial list of her powers (so far): flight, precognition, talking to ghosts, control of water, telekenesis, control of witchfire (you can't put it out, or heal its burns), and teleportation. Did I mention time travel? Time travel. So she's pretty tough, right? ...No. She does kill one vampire after it wounds her lover, but mainly she wanders around in a kind of daze, remarkably unconcerned by the strange and violent turn her life has taken.<br /><br />Anyway, I stuck with it to the end, only to find that I could have put it down at ABSOLUTELY ANY POINT and had as much closure as the \\"ending\\" provided.<br /><br />Other reviewers have compared this to Anne Rice. Anne isn't my favorite writer either, but she should be offended by the comparison.<br /><br />One last note: I'm kind of appalled by the number of reviewers that think this book is smart, or \\"brainy.\\"  It's partially set in a university and it has some scientific words.  Like... mitochondria.  Whoa!  Heady stuff!  Not.
0756404738|4.0|Luckily for me, I only heard about \\"The Name of the Wind\\" about six weeks ago, so I had a very, very short wait after finishing that to get my hands on \\"Wise Man's Fear.\\"  Overall, I would say that this one is somewhat better than the first, although there are some clunky parts near the end and it's not quite as even on the pacing as the first was.    This time around, I was a lot more interested in the Kote the innkeeper parts than I was the first time.  In the first book, they were annoying interruptions, whereas in this book there were times where I couldn't wait to get to the next interlude involving Kote, Bast, and the supporting cast.  The tales of Kvothe's travels to the other side of the map and the things he does along the way are fresh and interesting.    As I read these books, I kept wanting to get angry and call Kvothe nothing but a Mary Sue, but every time I'd get near that point, he would do something completely insane or stupid to bring him back into being a human being.  It's a fine, fun line to walk.  The only part of the book that got a serious eyeroll from me was the encounter with Felurian.  Most of that section reads like a 16 year old boy's idea of what a fantasy book should be like, including the insatiable, perfect naked woman.  Thankfully, it's saved by the interesting and evil creature Kvothe also meets during that encounter, as well as the hand waving that adds it to the cluster of craziness that makes up Kvothe's burgeoning reputation.    The only other issue I had was with the typesetting.  There were points where sentences ran together without a space in between, and every time I would run into one I would get rudely jolted out of the experience.  The same thing happened with a certain character's speech.  When that character would speak, capital letters weren't used--and it annoyed the hell out of me.  It was like watching an instant message conversation.  Pleas, please, PLEASE don't do annoying things like that.  Rural or regional speech full of phonetic spelling and apostrophes?  Great.  Magical creature has such a soft voice that her sentences don't begin with capitals?  Not great.  You don't need to remind me how your character speaks if you've done your due diligence in describing her, and believe me, no problems there.    The bottom line is that this series, and this book in particular, are wonderful.  I may have only heard of him less than two months ago, but Patrick Rothfuss has made a place for himself on my bookshelf, and I will gladly eat up anything he decides to put out.  Hopefully he won't pull a Melanie Rawn and leave his fans hanging for literally half their lives for the concluding volume (I got the second book of her magnum opus series on my 14th birthday and will be 28 next month with no third volume in sight, and yes, I know she's not my bitch, but come on).  This is an exciting writer and an exciting series, and you'd be doing yourself a disservice to give it a pass.  Plus, the guy has a mighty beard.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|In light of the current obesity epidemic in the US, this book may be one of the most important books of our time.  It takes a critical look at the data behind obesity and how that information contradicts the current national guidelines (and widely held beliefs) on how we should eat.  In light of this analysis, it is nothing short of horrifying to think about the millions of people out there honestly trying to manage their weight by following guidance from \\"experts\\" that is likely making their problem worse.  I hope this book is capable of changing some of that.    The book is grounded in solid logic and science, but is written to be accessible to all readers.  There are just enough references so that the engaged reader can fact-check on their own, but does not get bogged down in minutia.  For a more extensive presentation of the information, Taubes' other book, \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories\\", is supposedly much better (although I have admittedly not read that).    As a professional scientist and admitted \\"body Nazi\\", I was surprised by how much I got out of this book.  I have been interested and reading up on the hormonal impacts of eating for several years, but have yet to see as comprehensive and well presented treatment of the information as this.  There were several new concepts to me that I am grudgingly accepting, such as the idea that we eat more because we get fat and not the other way around.  This concept has dramatically changed my thoughts about the role of exercise in health and fitness; a difficult task for someone who has been accused of being a fanatic about working out.      In short, I will be suggesting this book to anyone who is interested in health and physical well being.  This includes friends who are competitive athletes, my science colleagues, and family members who may be struggling with their own weight problems.  I give this book my highest recommendation.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|I've seen halestorm in concert and they were great this album is very good but its only a hint of what they got!
B004LGPBZI|5.0|loved the album.  a very fresh sound.  they're not reinventing the wheel or anything like that but if you're tired of synthesizers, autotune and all those pro tools that are used in music now a days, this is definitely the album for you.  the highlights are \\"Kill For A Dream\\" , \\"Wigwam\\", \\"Standing on the edge of the noise\\", \\"Millionaire\\", \\"Three Ring Circus\\".  overall a very complete album. If you wanna rock out, there's a few songs that will get you jumping, if you want mid-tempo, listen to \\"Millionaire\\", if you want a power ballad, Diffent Gear offers some of that as well.  Liam sounds rejuvenated and the band more relaxed as a whole.
B00002SSKI|5.0|I'll admit, I'm biased in favor of this movie because I loved it as a kid, but it still warrants at least 4 stars in my book.<br /><br />Now and Then is the story of four best friends, told in flashback during a weekend get-together to reunite the girls after 15+ years of not seeing each other. The girls are Chrissy (Ashleigh Aston Moore, Rita Wilson), Roberta (Christina Ricci, Rosie O'Donnell), Samantha (Gaby Hoffman, Demi Moore), and Teeny (Thora Birch, Melanie Griffith). They reminisce about one summer in particular that marked the beginning of their growing up.<br /><br />Roberta found out the details of her mother's tragic death, Samantha's parents split up, Teeny spends the summer wishing to grow boobs, and Chrissy tags along for the ride. It all culminates in a seance they have in a graveyard to call back the spirit of a boy who died very young.<br /><br />The beauty of this movie is its carefree mood that really captures the innocence of childhood and the blind friendships that children have with each other. It is also filled with memorable scenes and character actors.<br /><br />I can't tell you how many times my friends and I would re-enact this movie or adopt one of the characters as our own. It has a special place in my heart and is a great coming-of-age story for girls.

B0041KKYD8|4.0|And I loved it! I love bad horror films, I will sit through just about anything. I even loved Black Sheep (not the Farley one, the badly made horror movie about killer sheep)  Not everyone is going to like this movie. It's bad, poorly made, the acting is terrible, it's too graphic-I could on. But that's what I love about it. If you love badly made horror movies with lots of blood spatter, terrible acting, and so on, this movie is for bad movie buffs like us.

0792162803|2.0|\\"Superstar\\" tackles the twin anxieties that spread fear in the hearts of teenagers, puberty and Catholic School.  The best of these kind of films are ones that tap into the pain and by circumstance the humor that exists in these subjects.  The best films in their respective genres are probably the work of John Hughes and a relatively obscure film from 1985, \\"Heaven Help Us\\", starring Andrew McCarthy.  \\"Superstar\\" does not breathe the same rarified air as those films.  The problem with this flick is that the humor is at best simplistic at worst sophomoric.  It would be helpful if the film contained some sympathetic characters.  Mary Katherine Gallagher as portrayed by Molly Shannon is both self-absorbed and obnoxious.  This may be intentional but it doesn't make her any more likable.  She reminded me of a more abrasive incarnation of a similar but more endearing character Gilda Radner portrayed on the original Saturday Night Live, Judy Miller.  This is one spin-off from an \\"SNL\\" sketch that should have stayed at six minutes.  This isn't the worst movie I've ever seen but it doesn't excuse it's mediocrity and forgettability.

The first is still the best.    [DW]

After a few listens, I realized that Essence was one of the finest albums ever recorded and that Lucinda was the finest woman (and maybe I shouldn't limit this) song writer in world. That's the thing about Lucinda - she doesn't repeat herself.  Blessed ranks right up there with Car Wheels and Essence, but it is a different breed of cat.    Lucinda also may be the finest singer on the planet.  Certainly she does more with fewer chops than anyone.  There's no artifice at all.  She can't hit the high notes; she doesn't have perfect pitch; she doesn't warble or swoop; she doesn't hold notes indefinitely; and she would never stoop to Auto-tune.  She just sings the damn song, tells the story, and delivers the emotion.  Isn't this the singer's job?    This is also a beautifully recorded album with some outstanding playing.  It's more electric-guitar driven than anything she's ever done before.    Don't limit yourself to downloading a few songs that may initially jump out at you.  Get the entire album and listen to it a few times.  Give it the attention it deserves and you may love Blessed as much as I do.    We are blessed by Lucinda who shares with us her love.

0393061310|3.0|Did agriculture, animal domestication and a region's geographic orientation provide some civilizations with advantages over others, allowing these societies to rise and gain superiority over disadvantaged regions? According to Jared Diamond, author of Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fate of Human Societies (1997) \\"Environment molds history\\" (p. 352). Diamond argues that environmental, not biological or cultural, factors played the most influential role in shaping historical progress and accounts for Europe's rise and dominance over other world regions.    Diamond, an evolutionary biologist and biogeographer, tackles the question of why some societies progressed and dominated other regions by systematically taking the reader on a 19-chapter, 13,000 year tour through world history. He supports his thesis by detailing how each phase is explainable predominantly by environmental and geographical differences.  Europe or Eurasia, as Diamond refers to this region, profited from these advantages and emerged as dominate leader.    Diamond argues that environment and climate helped crop cultivation and animal domestication in Eurasia leading to increased food production. Other regions suffered because of unsuitable climates for agriculture or a shortage of large animals that could be domesticated. Farming and herding resulted in what Diamond refers to as food production. When food supply is plentiful and people do not have to scavenge for food, populations increase. Throughout the book, Diamond reinforces the importance of food production in relation to advantages it provided for civilizations to develop and become more technologically advanced than other world regions. \\"Hence, all other things being equal, technology develops fastest in large, productive regions with large human populations, many potential inventors, and many competing societies\\" (p. 261).             Development, according to Diamond, is also affected by a region's geographic location. East-west geographic orientation of Eurasia, as opposed to north-south axis of Africa and America, fostered spread of agriculture and technology across the large continent.  The result was not only the development of organized empires and technological advances (transportation, communication, and weapons) but also epidemic diseases.  Germs, spread by animals, killed many. Survivors developed immunity affording them protection from these diseases. As these groups moved forward they spread these germs to other civilizations that they sought to conquer. Diamond illustrates this in Chapter 3 by describing how Francisco Pizarro with less than 200 soldiers brought about the collapse of the Inca Empire. Pizarro's men, armed with swords, armor and riding horses for speed and maneuverability, carried infectious diseases that killed many.   Diamond's book challenges a widely accepted theory that supports biological superiority.  That theory argues that the most intelligent beings are the first to invent, develop technology, conquer, and dominate. In contrast, Diamond devotes the majority of his book explaining why environmental differences determined dominance of one society over another. He clearly explains that Europeans had key advantages over Africans and Native Americans as of result of environmental and geographical differences not biological ones. Throughout the book, Diamond provides historical explanations illustrating why the racial superiority theory fails to fully explain these differences.    Given the topic's complexity, Diamond's style is very organized and understandable by the reader. He defines words, provides examples to support and essentially uses simple language. He intersperses personal observations and experiences with history and theory.   One could criticize that Diamond presents history following an inevitable path without conceding that culture and individuals play a significant role in world history. Although he fails to do so in the book, his theory could be extended toexplain modern occurrences. Diamond's statement in the book's Afterward clearly states his view: \\"My main conclusion was that societies developed differently on different continents because of differences in continental environment, not in human biology\\" (pg. 426).  He succeeded in providing a convincing argument while offering the reader much to ponder and debate.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|what can i say...? i love this movie (I REALLY DO) !! one of the craziest things i've ever seen ! AWESOME cast, AWESOME dialogs, AWESOME FIGHTS !! P.E.R.F.E.C.T. ! now i have to say: SCOTT PILGRIM VS THE WORLD IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE !
B00475AYJQ|3.0|I love Patrick Rothfuss' writing style, it's easy to read, straightforward, and engrossing.  Many thanks for allowing books that I can \\"sink\\" into and not have to worry about trying to keep track of three thousand different characters and threads (Robert Jordan's later works).    I did not enjoy this book nearly as much as the first.    -the tale with the bandits was entirely too long and incredibly boring.  I didn't care at all for the characters other than Tempi, and even he was only above average.  What about his forbidden love of music, what came of that?    -Denna continues to be one of the most colossally annoying lead female romantic characters that I have ever encountered in a series I like.  I can think of about a million reasons why I'd prefer he end up with Fela or something.  She's capricious, arrogant, unreasonable, and just plain annoying.  I don't care if Kvothe gets her eventually or not, which obviously to some extent he will.    -I agree with the uneven way the book is written.  Way too much detail and exposition on things like Felurian and the bandit story, and too little on other things, such as the shipwreck.  Certainly doesn't have the voice for battles like some other authors out there.    -I find it actually fascinating that once Kvothe adventures out there, like to the Mear and the bandits tale, and to some extent his little adventure with Denna in the first book, the story actually gets MORE bogged down rather than tighter, faster paced, etc.  I find myself forcing myself to read those passages, and those should be the ones gripping my interest.    -not enough happens for the length of the book in terms of advancing the overall story.  The unopened lockboxes are mildly interesting, as is the present location of the Adem sword...  but just not enough advancement and excitement.    If you read his blog, like I do, you know Patrick is a wonderful, generous, and caring person.  Also funny as heck.  But I'm sorry, this will not be the Empire Strikes Back of an epic trilogy.
0756404738|4.0|This book was good. Pat definitely created a fascinating world that he wants to explore. Those who read long fantasy series (Game of Thrones anyone? Wheel of Time? David Eddings' series?) are not strangers to sprawling landscapes and action that rarely picks up above the pace of a running turtle. Does it make the book bad? Not at all - some of us want to be brought into the world so carefully constructed and unique.     With all that said, I do feel that this book is a set up for at least one more trilogy. I sympathize with those you you who were frothing at the mouth at the end of Wise Man's Fear, because of all the questions that remain about Amyr, Chandrian, Bast, and myriad of other threads left untied - I was too. Doubly so, because who knows how long it will be until book III comes out. And while the story tends to wander off into new and tangled paths, some of which tend to take a long time to arrive at a clearing, it is still a pleasant walk nonetheless. Sometimes it felt like reading the Silmarillion  - which is as much a complain as it is a compliment - richly imagined and gripping, but at times so epic, you feel that the only proper way to read it is while climbing up Mt. Everest in full battle armor.    WHAT FOLLOWS IS A PURE SPECULATION ON MY PART.      My best guess is that third book will be at least as epic as the second and will bring us to present time in Kvothe's world. And I think that the second trilogy would take up the story of Kvothe in real time. Alternatively, there are hints in both books that the story may not play out well for Kvothe at the end of book 3. Which would be really unfortunate - the world of The Four Corners of Civilization is too fascinating by far to end it in three books
0517118297|4.0|Jane Austen is great - you don't need my review to figure that out. That said, this is one physically heavy book. If you like carrying reading materials around with you (for your commute, lunchbreak, day at the beach, etc.), than you are going to get a bit of a workout with this book because it's a total brick.<br /><br />Despite this drawback, it is nice to have all Austen's works in one volume, and you will look very distinguished for having it on your bookshelf.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is certainly one of the longest books I have ever read in my life, but the world that is crafted here takes a book this long to setup. George R.R. Martin has done a wonderful job of crafting a world of the seven kingdoms that highlights the political struggles and self motivations of seven ruling families. If you are a fan of the fantasy genre then there is a lot to like here, but take note that I would not actually consider this to be hard fantasy. While it does have knights and kings in it, there is no magic or fantastical beasts, at least not in any significant capacity. I have heard a lot of people compare this book and series to the Lord of the Rings. I think that comparison is apt only in relation to the scope of the world that this story takes place in, not in the way it is made.<br /><br />As is to be assumed with almost any book of this size the biggest drawback to it is the amount of information that is required by the reader. Very early on in the book you will find yourself overwhelmed with the amount of people you are expected to keep straight. On the whole though, once the characters are known the story itself progresses in a very forward fashion. The chapters are broken up nicely by the story progression of the individual characters and there were very few times that I ever felt that the story progression dragged on.<br /><br />Character development is very well done and I grew to love and hate characters in the book. What was great about most of the hated characters though is that none of them were truly evil. Everyone executed their actions due to various motivations which made not only their stories more interesting, but more human.<br /><br />Overall this is incredibly well crafted with one of the most interesting worlds I have read in fantasy in quite a long time. Don't be frightened by the length.
B001DHXT20|2.0|This movie takes an awful lot for granted, like assuming that everyone is already well acquainted with the Hulk before they started to watch this version.  The flashback reminders that zip through the opening credits don't help.  They never paused long enough to jar one's memory or give a boost to someone who has absolutely no idea who or what the Hulk is and why it's dangerous to make him angry.<br />Never mind, sorry, no time to pause... before you know it, ready or not, new story, new locale, new actor, brief homage to Bill Bixby and a walk-on by Lou Ferrigno, and we're off.<br />Why is he in Brazil of all places?  I know he's hiding out and all that, but still, Brazil?  It's not as if he wasn't easily found there.  I'd also like to know exactly where he lost his personality, Mexico?  Did they hire Edward Norton only because he sufficiently looked the part of a scientist/geek?  Or did they want someone so invisible that when the Hulk appears he really stands out?  And why was Tim Roth in this movie?  Anyone could have played that part, a stand-in even.  Was he hired for his lack of height?  As for William Hurt (I don't care if he did win an Oscar several decades ago), he only comes across as ruthless because they wrote him that way; he brings absolutely no menace to the part on his own.  Come to think on it, the only good parts in this movie were the three action sequences set so far apart I almost fell asleep waiting for them.  Each one an ambush; how many times can you ambush this guy before it figures it out, which he didn't, so I guess the answer is: he's a sucker for a good or bad ambush every time!  And this guy was supposed to be a brilliant scientist!  Hello!  He had enough sense not to use credit cards or cell phones yet he sends an email that's easily traced!?  Now that's congenitally stupid.<br />This, for me, was an extremely frustrating movie (the very end only made it worse).  I hope there's not a 3rd attempt to get the green guy right.<br />(I had a hunch I wasn't going to like this movie, which explains why I stalled so long before watching it.  And no, it's not a keeper.)going to like this movie, which explains why I stalled so long before watching it.  And no, it's not a keeper.)
0783233477|2.0|I was very disappointed with this movie and was grateful that I purchased it from a bargain bin for only $3.00. Based on the 1934 movie, Death Takes a Holiday, with Frederic March , this movie is pretentious, overly long, boring and even silly in places. Aside from a really bad blond dye job, Brad Pitt seems to sleep walk his way through the proceedings, (one wonders what the quirky Johnny Depp or earnest Keanu Reeves would have done with this role), and Claire Forlani as his love interest is bland and uninteresting with little or no discernible chemistry between the two. The always reliable and highly talented Anthony Hopkins manages to give his always stellar performance with minimal embarrassment. Aside from the 1934 version you can also find a 1971 version with the talented, although unfairly forgotten, Monte Markham which is still superior to this remake.

B003I87O2I|2.0|Regardless of Mick Jones's talents, Foreigner has always been a typical AOR band, generic lyrics and songs tilted toward the radio. Even still, it's interesting to see what they can come up with.    'When It Comes To Love' is actually a great song, and the album version has a nice extended intro. It's very generic but it's the king of song that you can relate to if you'd been in the situation. Besides that, only 'I'll Be Home Tonight' is worth listening to, songs like 'In Pieces' along with the title track sound like going through the motions. And 'Ready' has to be one of the worst songs I've ever been subjected to, terrible.     If you like Foreigner, try downloading When It Comes To Love, but even if your a big fan of their earlier work, this music is nothing amazing, and after a 15 year absence it comes as almost pathetic that this is the best they can do. But then again no matter how much play on classic rock radio they get, they will never be a 'classic' rock band, they are just an average AOR creation.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I consider myself a pretty athletic and in shape individual, and I was pleasantly surprised by what a great workout I got from this video. Jillian is no joke and doesn't let you slack off. You're always working two muscle groups at a time and I find myself breaking a sweat about midway through the workout. There is a good combination of cardio, abs and strength in each of the 20 minute sessions. There are three levels, each session 20ish minutes long, so you can pick how intense of a workout you want on a day-to-day basis and work up to doing level 3, or combining two sessions at once for a more intense workout.

B0040JHWKS|5.0|This is a wonderful CD, a look backward and forward simultaneously.  The music echoes the \\"girl group\\" Brill Building feeling of the late 60's while the words are as relevant today as when first penned in 1978.  If you love the music of the 60's and 70's, and you love Bruce Springsteen, you will love this music.  \\"Gotta Get a Feeling\\" is a particular favorite, but what Bruce did with \\"Talk to Me\\" makes Southside Johnny's version pale in comparison.  This is music that will have you singing along during one cut - and will bring a tear to your eye during another.  Even music you thought you knew \\"Fire\\" \\"Because the Night\\" \\"Racing in the Streets\\" all are presented with a different point of view, a slightly different turn of a phrase.  They all demonstrate the creative genius that makes Bruce Springsteen one of our best song writers and performers.  And the Band, the Band, the Band, especially Danny's organ - the jazz, rock, blues, jersey shore boardwalk sound are all here.  The best.  Now for a tour - come on Bruce, time for a tour.

B003Q6D1YW|4.0|Catfish is a beautifully made documentary that depicts the intriguing mystique of a fascinating encounter between two complete strangers, Nev Schulman and Megan Faccio, who happen to share a common bond, which millions may have experienced through the social network of Facebook.  And although the first 33 minutes of the film appears to be a typical display of discovery and familiarity on the part of the two individuals with the anticipation of emails, phone calls, and text messages that each exchange.  However, it is the last 54 minutes that will definitely entice the viewer to hear and watch the events and the reactions that unravel and reveal the truth.<br /><br />Nev decides to pay a surprise visit to Megan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and the excitement begins as he meets her family.  Indeed, Nev is greeted with open arms by Megan's down to earth parents, Vince and Angela as well as their two twin sons and their artistic eight-year old daughter Abby, who initially was responsible for the inception of this unique relationship between Nev and Megan with the painting that she sends to Nev.<br /><br />One must see this film to completely understand the entire premise of the entire film that may conjure an array of mix feelings for each of the individuals interviewed within each scene.  Because the film is carefully and meticulously done, there is no doubt that viewers may connect and share the empathy that Nev displays as he makes his discoveries toward the truth.
6302797624|4.0|I saw The King's Speech recently and although it was not a major enlightenment, I did have an \\"ah-ha\\" moment when I first noticed the phrase can be taken two ways. King's speech is a play on words: the King had a speech impediment and it weighed heavily on him as he was about to address the Nation, i.e., make a very important speech.<br /><br />So it is with Titles. Book titles and movie titles alike. There is sometimes an underlying meaning, a second, and yes, even a third meaning lurking beneath the structure of most Literary Titles. In fact, every once in a while, there is more than an ah-ha play on words. Some titles contain an enlightenment that will give you goose bumps.<br /><br />The Title that gives you A Big Chill.<br /><br />In the movie, The Big Chill, a group of friends get together after twelve years for the funeral of their friend, Alex. Two of the group, Sarah and Harold, have married and because Alex lived with them, albeit in their basement, they hosted a luncheon after the burial. Old ties renewed, the group decides to stay, and spend a long weekend together. When the rest of the guests leave, it is assumed Sarah and Harold send their two kids off to stay with a relative. As the story continues, it soon becomes more of a character study and we learn all sorts of things about each member and too, about their inter-relationships.<br /><br />But there is a Big Chill moment. It may come at a different point in the story for each audience member, but it should eventually dawn on you: why Alex committed suicide.<br /><br />I figured out what the Big Chill to this story is and I am about to reveal it.

Then, after familiarizing yourself, and you want to experience this movie in a whole different light, see what I say is the reason Alex lost Hope and then watch the movie again.<br /><br />Where did Alex's hope go?<br /><br />In the very beginning of the movie, Harold is seen giving his five year old son a bath. The boy has black, curly hair, similar to Harold's. As the film continues, we see, in the background, Sarah answering the phone; then, during the initial credits, we see clips of the guests packing for a trip between clips of Alex's corpse being dressed. One clip shows his bare leg just before his sock is pulled up. This shot suggests that Alex also has black, curly hair. Later in the story, we learn that Sarah and Alex had an affair. About five years previously, as Harold reports. The boy singing Jeremiah Was a Bullfrog in the bathtub is Alex's and I do not think Harold knows it. Maybe he does; however, one thing for certain, he does believe the affair had ended a long time ago. As for Alex's hope?

B0041KKYDI|4.0|Having read Aron Ralston's account of his ordeal while trapped, I was impressed by how much of the book the screenwriters and director managed to retain in the film.  James Franco and Danny Boyle, the director, do a great job of capturing Aron's sense of adventure, his emotions while stuck, and his agony when finally getting himself loose from the boulder that had pinned him inside a slot canyon.  Boyle's rapid-fire style of direction, with quick cuts, speeded-up sequences, and hallucinations on Aron's part help to build the atmosphere of the canyon and the inside of Aron's mind and emotions.  At first you wonder how anyone could sustain a film about someone being stuck for more than 5 days in the slot, but these guys manage to pull it off without a moment of dullness.      Good soundtrack too, and some nice touches during the hallucinatory sequences.     The only elements missing are the searches conducted by Aron's family and friends, and being reunited with them after going into the hospital.

One thing I like most about the book is that it follows just one character...no skipping around between 30 different people.  What I think is most spectacular about this series is the author's ability to weave a fine story...the rhythm of the prose and the emotion conveyed by the telling.  This is the finest storytelling I've read in nearly 30 years of fantasy.  Read it...and weep.

B00005QK3W|5.0|But anyway, I had written Macca off years ago after I bought \\"Off the Ground,\\" which sucked.  I found Driving Rain at Goodwill and thought it was worth a shot at $3.  I was surprised by how good it is.  I don't know how much you're willing to pay to give Sir Paul another chance, but you should like Driving Rain.

B004F8JW84|5.0|I am so surprise that there is no one to describe this CD, so that I should explain it for all reviewers how beautiful and especial it's if you want to try or hesitate to buy. I believe someone doubt why you should own it since you had Horowite played Scaraltti with outstanding skills; or some excellent pianoists, ex Pletnev and Schiff also gave us good listenning experience, what Tharaud could give us about different Scarlatti? As to Tharaud's music lover, I had owned his Rameau,and Couperin, and liked his baroque performance, so I expected him going back this period excellent keyborad composer, Scarlatti. I must say that after listenning more times, I never disappointed and apprecated to his poetic expression, which is different to other pianoists, but could give me another kind of listenning enjoying.   Of course some Scarlatti popular compositions ex sonata K.380, you will listen more lower speed, however, you will find it's fresh experience of scarlatti. I will recommand this CD to you, whatever you are fans of Scarlatti or Tharaud, it must be a great association.
B002XTBEDI|5.0|Judi Dench continues her role as the sort of anchor of a group of elderly unmarried women who live in the small rural English town of Cranford.<br /><br />Return to Cranford inlcudes two episodes that pick up where Cranford left off.  There are major changes afoot when the people of Cranford are forced to deal with the possibilty of the railroad reaching their isolated, thuogh largely contented town.<br /><br />Death and life continue to be the hallmarks of this story, as well as conniving characters, and characters who are entrenched in their views.<br /><br />Can Cranford survive the coming of progress, represented by the railroad, or will it be forever lost?  You will have to watch in order to find out.<br /><br />I found the acting, costuming, and story lines to be fantastic!  This set of tails is, probably 1/2 star dimmer than the \\"Cranford\\", but it still warrants 5 stars in my book.<br /><br />If you like period drama, BBC productions, and historical fiction, you will like \\"Return to Cranford\\"<br /><br />5 stars.
B00140PK6O|5.0|Judi Dench does a fantastic job of headlining the BBC miniseries Cranford.  Cranford is a small, rural, English town, and the miniseries follows the lives and times of people who live there.  The main storyline centers on a group of elderly unmarried women, including Dench.  There is also the Lady who lives in the manor house and who is the local member of the house of Lords.<br /><br />Life in rural 1800s England is a happy and tragic thing.  Though the town has a doctor, there was little that doctors could do at the time to deal with disease or serious injury, and death was a common part of life.  At the same time, people found joy in each other's company and the small and simple things of life.<br /><br />This series has a sort of Dickinsonian/Austenesque quality to it.<br /><br />The sets are fantastic, the costuming is amazing, and the storylines and acting are top-notch.  I found myself gaining an increased understanding of and appreciation for England and the English experience through watching this miniseries.<br /><br />Of course, this series is not for everyone.  If you are guy looking for an action-adventure flick, keep on walking, you won't find what you are looking for here.  If, however, you are a viewer who enjoys history, period films, drama, and BBC-style work, then welcome home!<br /><br />5 stars all the way.<br /><br />P.S. If you enjoy \\"Cranford\\" you will almost certainly also enjoy the [[ASIN:B002EWD0I6 Lark Rise to Candleford: The Complete Season One]] and the other seasons of that show as well.
1439102724|1.0|Having read every Jodi Picoult book so far, I could not wait to grab this one.  However, I wish I could return it!!!    The author has always touched on deep domestic issues and those tales have always connect with our hearts.  This one feels as though it is pushed at us -- infertility, divorce, alcoholism, religion, and far beyond with same-sex marriage, etc.  All felt a little too raw and did not present the author's best writing.      I was thoroughly disappointed and left out in the cold!    I would not recommend this book to anyone.
B003W5C0VW|5.0|Here's why I love this one: it's a great garage band at work.    If you see the Stones these days you'll never see some of the things caught on this film: Mick, \\"Keith broke some strings,\\" so we'll have to wait; tuning up before Midnight Rambler (notice how Mick keeps the audience under control by playing his harp, while also giving the guitars something to tune to). Keith goofing up the ending to Jumping Jack Flash. They're too polished for that kind of stuff now.    Midnight Rambler is worth the admission. Mick's harmonica playing is great and the band really cooks.    Bill Wyman is all over that bass and no one plays it like him. Yet he never moves. Neither does Mick Taylor, always just into his guitar, not watching the show it seems, but always adding so much. Love In Vain is all his, with Jagger perfect on the vocal.    Charlie knocks it out and as usual keeps them under control.  Keith: hard at work, no posing, none, usually eye to eye with Charlie most of the time.  The way Street Fighting Man is ramped up at the end is perfect.  The film, and the sound, is old school 70's so don't expect 36-track digital.  Prepare yourself for kind of a garage film for a garage band. Even with all those audio/video faults I still sometime watch certain songs just to concentrate on individual instruments, for instance, Bill Wyman's bass on most anything (Rip This Joint being one of his many stand outs).    This is what Scorsese should have seen before he made that crappy Imax film with 80 cameras and 70 sound technicians.  This film is basically shots of a garage band that really cooks. If any kids ask what's the deal with the Rolling Stones, I tell them to get this one.

0525423273|5.0|So this book is the perfect example of a Reviewer sold book, I heard so much hype about this book that I had to buy myself a copy.<br /><br />The first sixty pages or so I was highly doubting there opinions myself, as I was getting ready to stop reading this. I was bored and had no connection to the story, yet through a few blogger twitter recommendations I was urged to keep reading. Man, I am sooooo glad they urged me to keep reading. I was all of a sudden thrown into the story and felt like i was front row seated to watch this beautiful sweet romance bloom. Once, Anna really started enjoying her life in Paris the story just took over me and I completed the rest of the book in one read.<br /><br />An adorable love story with a touching and extremely romantic first kiss scene that will just blow you away. Highly recommended by me and glad that my fellow bloggers talked me into this read.
B0013FBS20|5.0|I cannot possibly express my love for this movie.  It is so good.  One of the best post-apocalyptic/vampire movies I have ever seen, and I love that genre, and have seen hundreds of movies of this type.  The story is awesome, and in some ways actually believable.  You need to suspend disbelief a little bit, but that is true of most movies, whether they deal with supernatural subjects or not.<br /><br />But the best thing about this movie is the creepy factor.  It's also extremely scary, and I love to be scared, as do most people who enjoy horror movies.  The director and actors do I really good job of drawing you into the action, and making the audience feel as though they are right there in the middle of it.  Truly some of the scariest sequences that have ever been filmed.<br /><br />If you enjoy horror/sci-fi/action adventure type movies, you will enjoy this one immensely.  I guarantee it.
B0034G4OUO|4.0|Dwayne Johnson plays Driver a vengeful ex-con out for blood but anyone who uses a .44 magnum to paint a wall with a tele-marketers brains, is a friend of mine. Well maybe a pen pal.  LOL.  Faster is one of those movies that's hard to praise but even harder to criticize. It is what it is.  Johnson is the Driver for a bank heist but the heisters get heisted by a rival gang and during that confrontation Johnsons brother is murdered.  Driver himself is shot execution style but survives and now has a steel plate in his head. After serving 10 years in jail for the bank robbery, Driver leaves the pen, hops in a fancy car stored for him, loads his magnum and begins his vengeance--first stop-the tele-marketer. But let's be fair.  Driver had just set out a tray with a Tv dinner and was about to sit and eat supper when he took a call asking him to subscribe to Better Homes and gardens magazine.(made that up but tele-marketers always know when you are about to eat, make love, use the potty)<br /><br />The movie is just mindless entertainment and features Billy Bob Thornton with a bizarre hairpiece that rivals Javier Badem in \\"No Country For Old Men.\\"
B00006L90T|4.0|I saw this at least 45 years ago and was so horrified that it stuck in my mind like a nightmare.  I have literally not seen it since then and was anticipating seeing it with great delight.  I can say without reservation that this is one of the best b-horror films that I have ever seen:  the actors are unknowns and often not that good, but there is a consistent mood of terror and morbid curiosity throughout.<br /><br />An inhibited girl is in a accident that occurred while recklessly racing boys.  Somehow, after 3 hours submerged, she appears to the astonishment of the cops who are looking for the car.  From the get-go,  she senses that something is wrong, but decides to go to a new job across the country without visiting her parents first.  On the way, she starts seeing things, in particular a recognizable face.  Upon arrival, she feels this terrible unease, the whole place seems alien and almost threatening.  She meets a lively, somewhat drunken boy who rooms across the hall, a kind of connection to life that she feels is vital yet cannot accept.  Their alienation, after a brief mating dance, is very sad.<br /><br />Strange things keep happening.  She develops a fascination with an abandoned amusement park, which she feels compelled to explore alone.  After a strange interlude where she appears to no longer exist - no one can hear or see her - she meets a stiff psychotherapists who tries to help but asks the wrong questions.  He concludes that she is \\"unusually strong willed\\".<br /><br />She is a church organist on her first job.  Her music forms an integral part of the horrific atmospherics of the film, indeed she loses control and improvises a bizarre tune with swirling, uncontrolled hands as images of dancing corpses - so similar to the tubercular melancholy of Munch's Nordic paintings - overwhelm her.  I have seen this image in my nightmares ever since.  Her soulless music disturbs the priest who hired her:  he is the other moral pole opposite the psychotherapist.  As she begins to accept that she doesn't belong in the town, the menacing otherworlders began to appear in full daylight, at times she has fleeting visions or herself among them.  It bores straight into the viewers subconscious fear of the mysteries of death.  I will not reveal the ending.<br /><br />Recommended with enthusiasm.  There is a reason this is called a cult classic.cept that she doesn't belong in the town, the menacing otherworlders began to appear in full daylight, at times she has fleeting visions or herself among them.

B0028RXXE8|5.0|This was a good show.  I watched it twice in a couple weeks.  Second time with the \\"All Roads Lead To Rome\\" feature on, which gives historical bits in relation to what's going on in the series.  Seeing it with that is a good excuse to watch it twice, though I wouldn't recommend it the first time.      And I would not have guessed Roman history could be so utterly consuming.  I kind of shied away from it for a while with bad memories of lit class Shakespeare plays I'd had to read in college in mind.  Not that those are not worth reading in their own right and I'd probably find a lot more to enjoy in those had I seen this series first.  What makes the series so strong though, is its subplots which are as engaging as the main historical events that take place.  It's as if through these subplots one comes to feel they really understand what was going on behind the scenes of the Roman history we are already somewhat familiar with.  These subplots and the characters in them really bring to full life the main events that go down.      As it's HBO, it's got all the sex and violence you'd expect from an HBO special. It's also got all the fine touches of detail and camera work that add such vibrant reality to a story making it a real work of art, one that often speaks volumes without words.      Beyond the lush cinematography, elaborate film sets and Italian location settings that make it easy to see how big the budget for this production must have been, you've got an excellent and incredible choice of actors in the cast.  There are just so many memorable and likable characters aptly realized in \\"Rome\\" that it is hard to choose a favorite: Pullo and Vorenus, Atia and Servilia, Julius Caesar, Marc Anthony, Cleopatra and Octavian...    What I like about the way the story is told is that the English is largely colloquial, which makes the scene and story all the more immediate, intimate and relatable. Not surprisingly though I read somewhere this show intitially didn't go down real well in Italy.  Well, the Queen's English and the cultural vibe it creates are obviously quite a bit different than the language of Italy and it's culture.  Irregardless, the BBC and HBO probably are as qualified as Shakespeare was when he first put these histories into the theatre.  The world of HBOs Rome is very convincing for what it sets out to do - tell an ancient story on somewhat modern terms - and has had me interested in all things 'ancient Rome' since seeing it.  There was talk at some point of the show going 5 seasons, but unfortunately it was condensed into just two finally due to the budget involved. A pity that, yet there is news of a big-screen sequel in the works which is supposed to pick up in Germany just 4 years after the series ended. Will be looking forward to that!  If you've liked any of the great HBO series, from Sopranos to The Wire, don't miss Rome..

Good to see that the publisher acknowledged the omission and made the fix, but the revised edition included barely legible thumbnails, so it was a half-hearted attempt at best.

If they can include the cover image, what about the remaining catalog?
B0032UYFA6|5.0|It is so hard not to be passionate about this show after watching one episode much less the first three seasons.  Episode one demonstrated this was not going to be a TV show like any other.  Television is a writer's medium and boy would I like to meet these writers.  The reason the acting is so outstanding is that the writing is so outstanding.  Bryan Cranston has now won three consecutive Best Actor Emmy's and now Aaron Paul just joined him with a Best Supporting Actor award.  Credit the writing.<br />Each episode has a movie quality because it's shot on film and not on a digital camera.  The wide open spaces provided by its setting in Albuquerque, New Mexico are perfectly used.<br />This is a series that can only be enjoyed if viewed from the beginning.  If you truly enjoy great acting, extremely plausible plot progressions, interesting characters, and are ready to become emotionally caught up with Walter White's little adventure, buy or rent the first two seasons and order season three to be delivered just as soon as it's available.<br />AMC has taken on HBO and Showtime and, with Mad Men and Breaking Bad, AMC has grabbed the bar and set it even higher than those two \\"big guns\\".

0307474712|5.0|For me, this was one of those books I expected to love right off the bat because of the wonderful praise it received from my favorite magazine, other authors, and the fact that it's being made into a movie. However, after the first 50 or so pages I felt a little bored...BUT I also felt like I couldn't close the book and give up on these characters (I have done this with other books) because I actually found them interesting and wanted to know what would happen by July 15th of the next year! These characters are flawed and I think that made them more fun to read about. So...I'm glad I didn't give up.  The way the author chose to show this love story, on the same day over 20 years was different but it worked. It kept me guessing and wondering from year to year. Over the years,I thought Emma and Dex's story showed how the choices we make (or don't make) can completely alter the direction our lives take.  I agree with many of the reviewers that David Nicholls can write great, realistic humor...I laughed a lot.  But, throughout this book there were many times I felt angry, disgusted(with Dex mainly), frustated(with Emma a lot), and sad.  I admit, like others, when I got to a certain part of the book I had to reread it several times because I couldn't believe what happened. Again, didn't see it coming but it worked.  This book does manage to surprise!  This author's writing made me feel a very wide range of emotions from beginning to end...I couldn't ask for anything more out of a book.  Loved it, enjoy!
B00026ZG10|4.0|That's Arnold's horrified wife Jamie Lee asking the question,just after it is revealed her husband had been leading a double life as a secret agent.True Lies(released July/94)is a wonderful action romp starring Arnold Schwarzenegger,Jamie Lee Curtis,Tom Arnold,Bill Paxton and Tia Carrere.If there ever was a \\"guys movie\\" this would certainly classify as one and Jamie Lee's considerable \\"assets\\" are shown off to great advantage.<br />The story involves one Harry Tasker(Schwarzenegger) who is a secret agent for the Omega Sector.The film opens as he and his partner Albert(Arnold)are crashing a dinner party at an expensive palatial estate in Switzerland:Arnold listens in electronically with orders and Harry does the walking.Harry meets up one Juno(Tia Carrere),supposedly an antiquities dealer specializing in Persian artifacts,based in Italy.She is actually a front for a terrorist organization called the Crimson Jihad,who are on a mission to obtain nuclear weapons for use against the U.S.Harry is found out and is chased away by the armed guards and just barely escapes.<br />Harry revisits Juno in her establishment in Italy to reconnoiter the place.The Jihadists are worried that their cover will be blown and they chase Harry through a local mall,but loose him.In the meantime Harry's bespectacled and plain looking wife Helen(Curtis)is leading a boring life.Harry,her \\"salesman\\" husband,spends more time away than with her and their daughter.She is spotted in a restaurant one day by a local car salesman called Simon(Paxton)who is on the make for women just like her looking for a \\"thrill\\" in their lives.Coincidentally,to pick up women,he uses a story that he is a secret agent being pursued by unknown enemies and that he needs people like Helen to help him.For awhile it works and Helen is receiving calls and rendezvousing in secret with Simon.One day when Harry drops by Helen's work to take her out for lunch,he happens to over hear her convo with Simon on the phone.He immediately thinks she is having an affair.Distraught he leaves but decides then and there to bug their phone line and tail her.It all comes crashing down on Simon and Helen when they are out at Simon's trailer.Just as Simon is about to put the push on Helen Harry,with the help of his agent cohorts,storm in on them and they haul Helen and Simon off.A cowering Simon admits to his fantasy scheme to pick up women and is let go.Helen however is \\"recruited\\" to go undercover as a hooker to plant a bug in the room of one of their targets.It's all a ruse by Harry to goad her on a bit then,now knowing she truly loves him,have a nice intimate evening alone.But things go awry as the terrorists have been following Harry and they capture Harry and his wife and whisk them both to an island in the Florida Keys.<br />Here the terrorists reveal to the world they have four nuclear warheads that they will detonate if their demands are not met.In fact one is armed and set to go off in an hour and half as a show of determination.With Helen in the loop both she and Harry combine to foil the terrorists and they cause alot of havoc.However in the process they get separated;Helen is taken hostage once more and Harry escapes and is rescued by Albert and friends.They pursue the convoy of Jihadists leaving the island,and two Harrier Marine Jets pound the convoy and take out a section of the causeway,stopping most of them in their tracks.The driver of the car carrying Helen is shot and as the out of control car heads towards the break in the causeway,Harry attempts a daring but successful rescue by helicopter.<br />On land Harry is informed that some the Jihadists that got away have reached Miami and have his daughter as a hostage.Harry commandeers a jump jet and goes to Miami and to the rescue.His daughter obtains a key that will detonate one the the nuclear devices and is chased out onto a piece of machinery extending far out from the building,a good 200 feet or so up.Harry not only has to contend withthe Jihadist leader,but also his compatriots circling in a helicopter all while attempting to rescue his daughter.It all comes to a fitting ending when the leader gets caught up on one of the jets missiles and the helicopter flies into perfect range and alignment.A press of the button by Harry sends the missile and ride into the helicopter taking out two birds with one shot.<br />The film ends with the couple now BOTH on assignment together.Who should they run into but old Simon,still trying to play the \\"spy\\" game with someone new.Helen pulls out a tube of lipstick,pulls it under Simon's chin and vows to waste him on the spot.Simon runs off,cowering with pants wet.Helen and Harry tango the night away.<br />True Lies doesn't have too many slow spots and moves along at a good pace.The movie has that wonderful twist;at first it's Harry leading a double life that his family are unawares of,but then Harry himself gets a shock as his wife,while not leading a double life,at least strongly fantasizes about having one,and Harry's neglect may be the cause.Just as this about to coalesce BOTH are then drawn into the terrorists plans and all is forced out and Helen's transformation from weak and plain to sexy and strong is as appealing a twist as pay day.It's a device that also gives the movie a greater character depth/appeal than would otherwise be.Each scene plays nicely into the next as the action lurks behind every corner,ready to pop out at any time.<br />What I want to know is this;there is a scene just after Harry has found out Helen has been \\"cheating\\" on him.When he is about to get in the drivers side of the van to leave you can clearly see a woman about a car length ahead of him standing there with a purse looking in the direction of the camera but really no where in particular.Who is she and .....why??<br />Technically the movie has been transferred well onto DVD in its original a/r of 2:35:1.Extras include only the trailer.<br />All in all one of Cameron's better efforts with Ahh-nold in one of his better films along with Jamie Lee Curtis looking particularly sexy,and Tom Arnold and Bill Paxton acquitting themselves handsomely.A great action flick for the guys....and ok the gals can watch too!

B001NFNFIK|4.0|You have to admit that in your average crime movie, you're not going to find a crotchety old detective, an alcoholic actor, and the ghost of a Confederate General teaming up (or at least contributing) to solving a series of murders. You get that here. I won't say that the story moves slowly in this movie, that would indicate that it could get boring. Let's say that the story moves along with a sense of stately grace perfectly at home with the Old South themes and settings.<br /><br />The cast is outstanding. Tommy Lee Jones and John Goodman pick up any film, and Peter Sarsgaard does a masterful job as the rich, alcoholic film actor with an irrepressible enthusiasm and absolutely no clue just how dangerous his behavior is.<br /><br />The movie is gritty and sordid at times. Even if the worst visuals stay a good bit shy of what other films might try to gross you out with, here they make sure that the dialog fills you in on anything they may have spared your eyes. The reaction of the man who swears off ever looking into a mysterious barrel again is real, and chilling, for example.<br /><br />You'll enjoy this movie for the unique flavor of its premise, and the entertaining interplay of its characters, or you won't much like it. Its a stage play set to location, not an action flick. I enjoyed it a lot.

B003VQQG8K|4.0|I received this ebook for under $4.00 for my Kindle.  I refuse to pay more than that for an ebook because you can't lend them freely, you can't sell them, trade them, or give them away.  So, $4.00 and below is the perfect price for this entertainment.    I enjoy Dan Brown's books and this one was no exception.  He grabs you at the first page and takes you on a thrilling ride until almost the end.  Like Angels and Deamons, there are several chapters after the end of the story that could be left out entirely.  I would have rated this book with 5 stars if it had ended at the end of the story.    I love his descriptions of places and things and the history surrounding them.  I enjoy his explanation of symbols and secret organizations, keeping firmly in mind that this is fiction.  I bought the illustrated edition and downloaded it onto my laptop Kindle ap so I could see the illistrations in color.  I had several hours of great entertainment for my money.  I'm ready for the next one.
B003U0AHBO|3.0|This Ridley Scott version of Robin Hood is well-made and entertaining, but considering the number of heavy hitters involved (Academy Award winners Ridley Scott, Russell Crowe, and Cate Blanchett), it's surprisingly lightweight.  I read some reviews by movie critics before watching the movie, and it wasn't nearly as bad as the reviewers made it out to be, but still not nearly as good as it could have been.  Russell Crowe is great in the movie.  But because he's so great, his scenes with Cate Blanchett are almost hilarious for that reason - by the end of two hours they're supposed to be in love, but they have zero chemistry between them.  Cate Blanchett plays the character of Marion as part-Nervous Nellie, part-ice queen, and expends little effort into developing her attraction to Robin.  The class struggle story is given added depth through a revelatory scene about Robin's origins - there is a serious statement about abuse of the lower classes that suggests that some deep thought went into developing the story, but the director (understandably) is focused for much of the movie on presenting the basic \\"Robin Hood\\" storyline such that the mystery of Robin's origins is given short shrift.  Max Von Sydow and Russell Crowe are terrific together in their revelatory scene.  And when the surpise is revealed, I wanted to know more about the surprise, rather than the familiar \\"rob from the rich\\" storyline that we've already seen in countless versions.  [About the surprise: Without giving it away, I'll just say that Robin's forgiveness toward his transgressor would make Jesus Christ proud.]  So there are elements in this movie that elevate it above the action-and-adventure genre.  For instance, the King John character in this movie is not just a stock evil king; he believes that his right to abuse the lower classes and to demand tribute from lesser nobles comes from God (the \\"divine right of kings\\").  But those original moments are too few, and overwhelmed by dialogue and scenes that only serve to move the plot toward the next battle scene.  At the end of the movie, I was impressed by the movie overall because it wasn't nearly as bad as I was expecting, but I wouldn't voluntarily choose to watch it again.  So my recommendation is this:  You should rent, not buy.
B00406UK7S|5.0|If you've seen movies like this over the years and even up to Gladiator with Russell Crowe, then you already have an idea what the movie is about. You already know there's going to action and will it entertain you.    For us it did. We relaxed and enjoyed it. It's NOT Gladiator. It's realistic and well choreographed, sound is good, the acting is good and the scenery is enjoyable.  The film quality is good as well. It's not going to WOW you but it can and should entertain you if you like these kinds of movies.  I give it 5 stars because I already had an idea of what to expect from other reviews and yet when the movie was done, I was glad we bought it.
0061438294|5.0|Excellent book to understanding what people are saying with their bodies, movements, gestures, and mannerisms.  After reading this book I also took a seminar about interviewing people regarding losses/theft/ and stealing from their own companies.  Many of the things I read in this book were confirmed and substantiated in the seminar.  One of the most important things is too understand is that one needs to establish a baseline of behavior for an individual, then look for the behavioral leakage when stress or pressure is being put on the same indiviual during questioning.  This book helps you understand that and then what to look for in these 'leakages'.  A great book that is very easy to read and understand!
B001PU8N0I|5.0|I love British television and their wonderful series. This story is full of twists and turns,heartache and wrong matches.Matthew is excellent and spot on in his portrayal of a man full of doubts as he overcomes a difficult childhood. Secrets are uncovered,tragedies occur and unexpected marriages and story twists. All in all a very good story.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I actually prefer this movie to the book, which is rare. A great film with strong, memorable characters. Simple as that!
B004LQI0HE|5.0|It is irksome that the question exists of whether or not a clone would have a soul. As a child, the common thread in the churches we attended was that no, animals didnt have souls, when they passed on that was it. No, animals didn't go to heaven, only humans went to heaven. It seemed to be an easy answer to deflecting a child's question of why we kill animals, and why is it okay to kill them for food?  These honest questions I had in my childhood were answered in that we can do whatever we want because we are important, we have souls.<br /><br />It's a saturday evening and I almost chose Burlesque, glad I didn't! I thought this was a great movie, I had a lump in my throat in the end. The clinical manner in which these donors live and that they're allowed to wander about the country like free-range cattle, only to be herded into a death that would never be mourned by friends or family members is...cold and inhumane.<br /><br />The romance, jealousy, love, hurt, and acceptance of \\"it is what it is\\" is exceptionally portrayed by the cast. You so want them to make an escape and wonder if their country is the only one that allows the practice of cloning to donate, what if they did escape?
0670022411|5.0|Pour a pot o' tea, burrow down in your favorite armchair or end of the couch, grab a blanket, cozy? Prepare to lose track of time. This story has depth, dares to realize that readers can TOO follow more than two main characters around, can TOO wrap their heads around various plots, and enthralls while whetting the appetite to delve into history--and not the kind you learned in school. A fantastic read! My only complaint? Author needs to hurry up with the next book ;D
0670022411|5.0|This book has all the elements I love...history, witchcraft, academia, and fascinating stories of a variety of relationships. Harkness explores important questions like why do we love who we love? How do bonds of family influence our decisions? At what lengths will you go to protect what you love? Who do you owe allegiance to? Well written and fascinating. I can't wait for #2.
B000R2SXJ6|5.0|Ok, it's not true that the original album cover was just a snapshot taken in Jimi's hotel room.<br />How to review this... It's Jimi Hendrix, for gosh sakes!!!Imagine being a kid and listening to Jimi Hendrix on those big old headphones and having your friend John McCue teach you how to play the electric bass using Jimi (and Sir Paul) - it all comes back again across the mists of time when you pop this original British Edition of Electric Ladyland on your turntable.<br />What's different from the US version? 1983 is not truncated in the version heard here - it continues on into Moon, Turn The Tides as the gods of rock intended it to sound. The Brits focused on sound quality more than overproducing and cleaning the studio album for domestic ears - lots of background chatter, crisp clear recording of Mitch Mitchell's drums, Noel Redding and, of course the real show, Jimi with those \\"What ARE you saying?!?!\\" lyrics in those \\"What ARE you wearing!?!?\\" outfits just loving life. Ask Lemmy!<br />This is a beautiful recording meant to be played, not left in cellophane like a museum piece.<br />The album cover was rapidly replaced, not by the Central Park Linda Eastman shot Jimi had chosen, but with the red and yellow blurry Jimihead you see on you iTunes screens, more suitable for the sensibilities of the times than a group of naked women who would not be perfect nor anorexic nor photoshopped enough to make it on an album in todays esthetically anemic music world. Inside cover green smoke shot of Jimi with little snaps of Mitch and Noel.<br />WOW!<br />Autotuners heads will explode when they hear raw talent - play this LOUDLY for them all.
1599218011|5.0|I never imagined I'd say this about a nutrition book, but this is a total page-turner.  Kris Carr is funny and to-th-point.  Great info, both from Kris and the other experts she brought into the book.  I'm really excited about adding this layer of perspective to my food choices.  I love the way that the author presents the full vegan, alkaline diet as the best choice but she also discusses the balance of food choices realistically... recognizing that having a cup of coffee once in  a while doesn't ruin the whole thing.  It's about making intentional, informed choices to support your system.  Her approach makes this type of diet seem pretty attainable.  I've been wanting to get into juicing for a couple of years, and this book has tipped the scale.  Time to make that investment and get the benefits of the juice!

After that you need to go into vent and switch your push-to-talk key then you can switch it back and it should be working. Other then that it's a great product.
0767812387|5.0|All I can say is I love this movie it makes me feel good every time I see it,the music the dancing are great but the love story keeps me coming back buy thus movie you will love it.I just wish it would come out on bluray I would love to see deleted scenes and the music videos all  in one place.
B0028R3G5O|4.0|`True Colours' is a double best of collection from this eighties icon and whilst Lauper is still creating decent music these days, it is still great to listen to this and relive good memories.<br /><br />This has all the hits you would want, as well as some others thrown in for good measure.  `Time After Time', `True Colours' and `Girls Just Wanna Have Fun' are all here and sound as fresh as ever and tracks I love like `She Bop' and the Goonies track are also here to please her fans.  With two discs worth of music you get a great selection of her tracks and if you only wanted to buy one album of her stuff, then this is a pretty good place to go.  You may want to go and check out more after hearing this, but this will keep you going until you do.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0024FA9IM|5.0|I had already saw this movie on DVD of course, but I just had to get it in Blu-Ray for my own enjoyment of watching it in a clear HD environment & it did not let me down. I have heard & saw reviews from Other people saying the movie was not a great movie. Well I grew up watching Lost In Space the TV show & I absolutely loved it & I watch it over & over again. This is a great movie especially if you have a family to watch it with like kid's because it is totally kid friendly. I like the futuristic stuff in the movie & I would love to have the video diary watch even as an adult it would still be cool to have one. Anyway if you have an open mind check it out. Do not listen to others because apparently they have no taste what so ever because this movie rocks & I can't wait until my little niece get's a little older so she can watch it also. I am very glad that I bought this movie in Blu-Ray Form because it looks so good on my biggie screen(Smile). As always Amazon you Rock!
B00008BXJG|5.0|`Highway to hell' is one of those required albums for any discerning metal collection and for music fans in general.<br /><br />The last album before Bon Scott died, this has his trademark rasping vocals in spades and coupled with some of the best riffs to have ever jumped off of Angus' fretboard, this albums offers plenty to delight us.  The title track is one of those songs that will have you nodding your head and stamping your feet along in unison and shows the band at the top of their game.  `Love Hungry Man' has one of the best bass riffs on the album and leads into the more sedate `Night Prowler' which ease you out of the album in style.<br /><br />The cover artwork has become a classic now and that sneering pout from Young, with the devil horns is certainly iconic.  All in all, this album gives us pounding riffs and screaming vocals that will make the hair stand up on your neck.  It is rock music at it's riff-tastic best and is certainly worth a listen.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

0670022411|4.0|I picked this up based on the promise that there would be a novel interpretation on the origin of vampires, demons and the like, and, it seems to have delivered.    I read the Twilight Series (had no idea what it was about, just found it in Target one day and thought it looked interesting).  Twilight was OK, but, I found it juvenile.  I was hoping this would NOT be like that, and, found it much better.    Only gave 4 stars because there was too much \\"damsel in distress\\" stuff for me.  The main character, while being portrayed as smart, really seems to have trouble figuring anything out on her own.
0316098337|4.0|From the minute I opened this book I was hooked! Scary, sweet, touching, sad, happy, horrifying and surprising are all words that can be used to describe this book! Reading this book while on the treadmill at the gym made the time fly!  I did'nt even know I was excercising! At times it made me cry, and I must admit I had some trouble sleeping a couple of nights.  All in all it was a quick read and seemed very believable.
1878424505|1.0|This book is the epitome of the useless self-help books that are designed to appeal those that simply accept whatever's put in front of them. At some parts of the book, it feels like he was high when he wrote it. This book is just pages and pages upon blabbering claims about life that are in no way argued or defended with evidence.
0670022411|3.0|The good and the bad balanced each other in this book, hence the '3-star' rating. The good: an entertaining blend of witchcraft with vampires and other fantastical creatures, well supplemented with interesting factoids from history or literature. The bad: too many long-winded forays into passages that did little to advance the story, and sudden introductions of new characters who, with little development, abruptly became major players in the plot. This book would have benefitted from a good editorial scrubbing.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|This movie is the one of the best film ever made in Japan.  I usually do not pay attention to modern Japanese film productions because they make cheap in qualities. However, Departures, Okuribito in Japanese, is well made with all the essence of human lives.  The music by Joe Hisaishi is beautifully done and touching.  I cannot watch without crying, not because it is sad rather it is moving.  Brilliant.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|I'll make this short.If you're thinking of buying the whole album you're reading the right review. I don't like every song that's on here but there are some good ones. If you don't want to buy the whole thing then just get these songs: Freedom Fighters, Heart of Courage, Protectors of the Earth and To Glory. Those are my favorites. Heart of Courage and Protectors of the Earth are 2 of my all time favorite songs. The first time I heard Heart of Courage I imagined myself walking through the gates of Heaven and this song was playing at the entrance. It's that good.    Also know that I'm a very difficult person to please.
0756404738|5.0|The one huge problem is me having to wait a few years to read the next book.    The book is huge and I finished it in 3 days. I could not put it down. If you liked the first, you will not be disappointed.    I'm seeing a problem wrapping this series up in 3 books.  Unless the next one is 1500-2000 pages long, I don't see how they can cram a few more years of Kvothe's life, killing king's and what not, and then his fall.  My guess is that the last book will be split in two.  Both to make more money, and to keep us from having to wait a decade.
B001YYQ9SS|4.0|Ok. If you've seen the regular edition of FF7 and you're wondering about this one, then get it. Some new scenes have been added and there are some that have been changed a bit to make them better. For example, the last battle scene has been changed to be more violent and the highway scene has been changed to be even better. I have not followed the FF series and I only played one FF game ever. That was X-2. As for the CGI quality in the movie, it's the BEST I'VE EVER SEEN. You can see the veins in a persons eye, the details in the buildings and lanscapes as well and you even tell what a persons clothes are made of.    The video quality of this movie is great but I think it would have been better if they had added more vibrant colors instead of a darker color scheme. Some parts are vibrant though.    The audio quality is really awesome. The sound effects of motor bikes and other noises are realistic. If you're wondering about the Japanese audio, that's in TrueHD 5.1 as well. So if you hate the English audio switch it to Japanese. The Japanese audio is better.    This movie loses 1 star for the lack of vibrant colors throughout. I like the movie and its one of my favorites. Just one more thing to keep in mind is that I'm VERY DIFFICULT TO IMPRESS ME.
B0043RSJ8G|1.0|I have read almost every book Jodi Picoult has written.  Each one causes me to think about my views and how I would handle the situation she has described.  Each one causes me to question myself and each one has been a wonderful read.  That is until Sing You Home.      Jodi Picoult had the perfect opportunity to open people's eyes about a very controversial subject matter in today's society.  She had a platform to perhaps change some people's views on homesexuality and same sex marriages.  She had a beautiful story between Zoe and Vanessa that might have made some skeptics or opponents think twice about how they felt.  Yet she chose to throw it all away with her vile unecessary view of Christians.  I found the book to paint an extremely unfair and negative view of Christians.  Jodi Picoult denigrated the Christian faith and belittled the people who live a life with Jesus in their heart.  I know people like Reid and Liddy who truly believe in their faith and they are wonderful and kind and caring people.  I know a woman who lost her child to a tragedy at the age of 11 yrs old and her faith in Jesus has saved her from the depths of hell that losing a child can throw you into.  Jodi Picoult decided to paint all Christians as fire and brimstone homophobes and she then continued her path of destruction by adding in anyone with conservative values as haters.  She glorified atheists and condemned people of faith.  It was completely offensive and destroyed a story that could have been positive and uplifting.  I am a christian who does not have a position on same sex marriages.  Jodi Picoult had an opportunity to sway my decision to being on the side of couples like Vanessa and Zoe.  She had a chance to enlighten me on things of which I have no first hand knowledge.  Instead her negativity and hatred of faith ruined that chance.
B000I2J6K0|4.0|I have been very pleased with this video.  I am someone who has exercised moderately in the past, but not consistently.  This is a challenge, but not too much.  I really like the down-to-earth nature of the video and the running commentary by Erin O'Brien.  The incorporation of some dance moves and yoga poses make for a nice combination of aerobic exercise and toning.  I even like the music--instead of some horrible new-agey soundtrack, there are cute upbeat arrangements of nursery songs like \\"Itsy Bitsy Spider.\\"<br /><br />My only complaint is about the second part of the video, the \\"partner workout.\\"  I had thought it was going to be a way to actually work out with your partner, but instead it is basically just a workout where you use your partner as a prop.  I haven't had the heart to make my husband do it with me yet, though others who have tried it might have a different opinion.
B00453YBE4|3.0|I Love Judas Priest, They are my favorite band, not just Metal band of all time.  That said, I was disappointed by this download.  There are a couple of worthy tracks on it (Namely the Title Track and Speed of sound, but even the southern-rock sounding till the day I die isn't bad), but it is NOT anything like a JP Album.<br /><br />  I guess I should be pleased that it isn't Priest with a different backup Band, but I truly wonder where Rob was going with the concept.  Its just poorly written, weak material with mediocre execution.  The 1st half seems like a feeble attempt at appeasement of metal fans, while the last half of the album is almost entirely Metal-done-ballads with a strange twist. I wanted to love it, I wanted to even like it, I've listened to at about 30 times on several different systems and in different environments, but its just not good.  What I found myself doing was listening to 2 or 3 tracks of the whole, and going back to my priest discography, which I have all of.  If you want some decent, but mindless metal tunes, Made of Metal and Speed of Sound are OK.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Rob Halford is singing.<br />- Has a couple of simplistic metal tunes on it.<br />- Cover art is cool, but uninspired.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The Material is very weak (The songs are internally inconsistent, and few if any fit any discernible \\"Theme\\" or \\"Idea\\".  Contrast Nostradamus.)<br />- The Musical Scoring is poor (Like the writing, the musical execution is neither consistent nor pointed.)<br />- The Technical and Mixing is amateurish (The songs are not even in volume, the Vocals_vs_guitar_vs_bass_vs_Drums Mixing is poor and wavers throughout, and all of it sounds quite thin).<br />- The entire album ends up a confusing HUH? for metal fans, and painful train-wreck for most any true Judas Priest or Halford Fan.<br /><br />In Closing... what can I say?  Rob is back with Priest, and things sound better (though still much thinner sounding than old priest).  I struggled mightily to find a point to the material.  I even mulled over that it may not have a point, and just be a collection of Ideas and 2nd passes that never made it into another piece.  If that's the case, then I would say that there was a good reason for their previous absence.  I awarded it 3 Stars, 2 of which are because it's by Rob Halford, and one because of the couple of acceptable tracks on it.  There are only a few bands in the world that \\"Got it right the 1st time\\", Judas Priest was one of them in my opinion, Rob Halford's voice is legend in metal Circles, and it is wasted on this album.  I would honestly rather listen to Rob sing old priest songs the the shower whilst gargling than most of these tracks.mulled over that it may not have a point, and just be a collection of Ideas and 2nd passes that never made it into another piece.

0689865384|4.0|What do you think of Uglies? I am a male 7th grade student and have read this book recently. I can't wait to read the next couple of books, even though the main character is a girl. I thought that the whole concept was enthralling, though the whole basis wasn't original.      Uglies, even though it wasn't original, is a very good book to use with middle school students. The book is a hodgepodge of different topics. In some parts of the book there is romance, drama, action, adventure, and even terror. The book is about a 15 almost 16 year old girl who lives a secluded life and thinks going across a river to a different town called New Pretty Town is exciting. Every one in Uglyville thinks this is exciting though for Tally this is about to change. This book is filled with surprises and odd occurrences. For a lazy 7th grade class this is the perfect thing to wake them up. If it were me I would give this book 4 stars, since the idea wasn't original.     Finally this book is an interesting persceptive on life in the future, although it may seem far-fetched if you really think about it there are many things this society does that we do today. Want to wake your 7th grade class up the pick up this book at your local retailer today.
B0044XV3R8|3.0|I rented this movie initially rather than see it in a theatre because I wasn't thrilled with all the hype. My husband and I watched it two nights in a row before returning it, then bought this extended collector's edition. We both really love the movie, but whoever designed this packaging should be fired. It's a card stock sleeve enclosing a cardboard sleeve, enclosing a cardboard \\"book\\" with three slide-out card stock pull-outs that each house a disk. It's hard to separate any level of this packaging from the others, and disc 2 is already scratched from sliding in and out of its card stock sleeve, after only two or three viewings. VERY disappointing. I wish they'd put it in an accordian-type package that still contained the traditional plastic snap-in disc holders. Now our collection is essentially worthless because disc 2 skips and freezes badly in several very key sections. How do I replace one disc of a 3-disc collection?
B000002KOQ|4.0|There's a couple reasons I didn't give Ladies of the Canyon a perfect 5-star rating, but despite the tiny flaws, it's still a really pleasant and rewarding album overall.    One reason is that Joni's songwriting feels a bit weak and predictable this time around.  Strong emphasis on a *bit* weaker.  I'd still take this stuff over most singer/songwriter material out there.  The title song and \\"Rainy Night House\\" immediately come to mind as far as being somewhat predictable, however in the case of the latter there's a really dark atmosphere to the classical-influenced piano playing, and the dark lyrics totally make up for any standard songwriting habits.  In fact, what other female musician at the time was writing such dark and depressing lyrics?  Perhaps \\"The Arrangement\\" suffers from ever so slight repetition as well.      Another minor flaw is that the lyrics are fairly basic and unsophisticated for the most part in order to compliment the basic songwriting, which is definitely NOT how I feel about future Joni records.  One huge exception is the lyrically-creative \\"The Priest\\" which gives us a different kind of perspective dealing particularly with eye movements when communicating with priests.  Interesting way the lyrics are written.    Also, even though her version of \\"Woodstock\\" far outshines Crosby, Stills and Nash's version, it's still the obvious (and overlong) weakpoint.  I don't know, but that vocal melody never really did a darn thing for me.  I never got the appeal of it.  At least Joni's soothing voice gives it some atmosphere, whereas CSN's version does absolutely nothing but beg for me to turn it off right away.    In the end however, every complaint I've mentioned so far is, honestly, extremely minor and insignificant to the overall listening experience.  I just believe deep inside that everything else Joni Mitchell released from 1968 through 1976 is much much better.  In fact, every other album from that 8-year stretch gets a perfect 5-star rating outof me.  Ladies of the Canyon is the only exception.    Let's give this album some much needed compliments before people assume I'm starting a hate agenda.  \\"The Circle Game\\" is by FAR the greatest song here.  It has a devastatingly beautiful vocal melody with powerful lyrics, \\"For Free\\" has a touch of sincerity that can't be matched by anyone else, and \\"Conversation\\" has interesting lyrics about a woman who apparently enjoys meeting up with a man without the guys wife knowing about it (apparently the woman is only interested in a friendship, but maybe there's more to it than meets the eye) with a solid vocal melody to keep it strong.    Also, let's not forget there *are* examples where the simplicity works extremely well, such as on \\"Morning Morgantown\\" with its flawless vocal melody, and \\"Willy\\" is quite the underrated track.      Another thing worth mentioning is that Ladies of the Canyon seems to do one thing better than any other Joni Mitchell album from the classic years- the piano playing is normally really good.  Whether the piano is playing in a depressing/haunting kind of way, or being utilized in a beautiful/uplifting situation, Joni *always* finds a way to make it fantastic.     Overall, it's good and I honestly love about 75% of it, but it's not the best work of the legendary Joni Mitchell.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|This is one great flick! An ensemble cast in no particular order, Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, Mary Louise Parker, John Malkovich, Brian Cox, Richard Dreyfuss, Ernest Borgnine! Yes, you did not misread, Ernest Borgnine! Many would remember him from The Wild Bunch, The Dirty Dozen or Airwolf, just to name a few. Bruce plays a C.I.A. retiree named Frank Moses who becomes enamored with Sarah , a young lady who works for the Pension Department. Over the years of retirement, Frank still tries to keep in shape & keep his senses sharp as ever. For good reason, he is on a hitlist which is being carried out by his former employer, the C.I.A.!!!!<br />A mission from 1981 comes back to haunt Frank & everyone involved in a greater conspiracy that could see the Vice President make a successful bid for the election of becoming the next President.<br />After he dispatches the hit team with devastating results, he meets Sarah & takes her with all around the country, meeting up with allies & trying to get to the bottom of this conspiracy.<br />The mayhem, chaos & fun continues right until the end! This movie never lets up! They maybe retired but they are still the best at what they do! Based on the comic book of the same name, it's just great to see all these actors & actresses have lots of fun doing what they do best!<br />Highly recommended!

It can be as little as 2% up to about 20%. This movie was absolutely perfect. This is the disc I am now using for my \\"golden master\\" of 3D perfection. I am now asking: \\"If they can do such a perfect job on this movie... why not all 3D movies\\"?<br />Disc Performance: This disc performed perfectly. No aberrations of any kind (audio, video, 3D or skipping).
1439102724|2.0|I'm a conservative Christian, but that's never stopped me from loving a good read from Jodi Picoult. Going into Sing You Home, I heard over and over that both sides were portrayed \\"sympathetically,\\" that there were no \\"bad guys,\\" and that all viewpoints would be represented fairly.<br />Disappointingly, this was not true at all. Christians are shown as rational and human only to the degree that they eventually part with their faith. For those who disagree, consider that the Christian right portrayed in this novel is shown as being equally legitimate as Fred Phelps and his \\"church.\\" It's akin to a book portraying an extremist, women-oppressing, infidel-hating group of Muslims as representative of the Average American Muslim, but doing it \\"sympathetically.\\"<br /><br />This novel was sold to me as an exciting, tension-filled controversy; instead, it was a match-up of good vs. evil where there is no controversy because there's clearly only one right side and that side has to win in the end. And yes, as a diehard Jodi Picoult fan, I'm willing to overlook some formulaic elements in the name of a good story. But there is no story here; just some pretty writing, stock characters (the extent of Liddy's character expansion? She loves cheesy horror films--how multi-layered!), and a lot of agenda pushing.

B002ZG98VE|3.0|Robin Hood isn't necessarily a BAD movie by any means.  It's just that... you know, I must have seen this same type of theme a thousand times by now.  I'm pretty worn out with the whole concept.      You have your typical castle theme, you will soon witness a huge army of both good versus bad constantly fighting each other, you will then get to experience countless and tiresome scenes of deadly, flaming arrows shooting across the land killing people in dramatic play-like fashion, and the entire concept is just pretty boring and overdone by this point.     I think the thing that really irks me above everything else is that, despite the fact you're supposed to feel excitement over the constant battles taking place, you actually feel exhausted and cheated instead.  Exhausted because they never end, and cheated because they're never believable or vicious enough.     I'd really like Hollywood to try coming up with some more interesting and creative concepts in the future, because these type are really beginning to get on my nerves.  As far as Russell Crowe's performance, he was decent enough but he's still a pretty overrated actor if you ask me.    I don't know what else to say.  I've experienced so many action/adventure flicks over the years identical to Robin Hood that it's honestly becoming harder and harder to deal with them anymore.  At least that Prince of Persia movie was a little bit better storyline-wise mainly because the action scenes were spread out enough to actually notice and appreciate them whenever they occurred.  I recommend that movie over this one.
B0042GIRYE|4.0|Love this album.  A couple of the songs are a little quirky, but still musically and vocally very interesting.  \\"Colder Weather\\" is the song that prompted me to listen to the samples and I decided to order. I think the Zac Brown Band is my favorite new band.  I hope they continue to give us their unique sound.  I can pick a Zac Brown song out right away when I hear it and for me that's a good thing.

This band has ambitions but no creative talents. They think they can make music like Pink Floyd but what comes out is garage sale.

0446693804|4.0|A Walk to Remember is a passionate book filled with unique love between two of the main characters: Landon Carter and Jamie Sullivan. There were many reasons why this book is marvelous. Specifically, Nicholas Sparks, the author, gives grand explanation of each character mentioned in the book. For example, the book starts off by describing Hegbert, Jamie's father, in numerous detailed ways, explaining how he's used to be harassed, the connections with the Carter family, characteristics, jobs, etc. Meanwhile, the novel characterizes Landon's buddies significantly, while still incorporating Hegbert. Later, we get a clear understanding of what kind of person Jamie is and how much she adjusted throughout this classic literature. Moreover, she began as a shy girl that's never had a boyfriend, was never kissed, and always had a bun and sweater on. But, she transformed into a \\"stronger,\\" \\"flirtier\\" girl that finally decided to take a risk. Landon, the \\"story teller,\\" had a large amount of summary's about his past and what he wants to do with his future. Also, Landon is similar to Jamie because of the fact that he changes from a popular jerk to a boy that falls in love with a \\"nobody\\". Lastly, supporting characters had been involved as well, with little snippets of explanations about themselves from \\"here to there.\\"     Theme- clearly describes the point and storyline of a book. A Walk to Remember clearly shows the theme of true love and perspectives, which make the novel such a hit seller. Love is a broad word, there are many versions of love, but what Landon and Jamie had was perhaps something special, causing the theme to be unique. Both main characters are like two opposing teams. Each obtains contrasting rankings, standards, personalities, characteristics, etc. Most importantly, Landon was in a friend group that made snotty jokes about other kids, especially Jamie. Though, she tried to not pay attention to what others thought of her, overall she had no social life, notincluding the orphanage. Once, they went to the homecoming dance together something clicked; the only problem was that Landon couldn't admit his feelings to Jamie because of what his peers would think. Before, Jamie was just a creep from the outside, until Landon got to know the true person that she is from seeing her and spending so much time with her. During the Christmas show Landon finally admitted, \\"You're beautiful,\\" right to her while she showed herself as an angel. So, his original perspective was far from right \\"you can't judge a book by its cover.\\" All of these little details inspired a tremendous theme that is so perfect in its own little way.   Finally, emotions were definitely teased when reading between the lines, making A Walk to Remember a true meaningful enjoyment to make a person feel like their part of the journeys.  In the beginning, the plot doesn't really influence reader's emotions, but, once Landon and Jamie start seeing each other those feelings take you on a rollercoaster ride. From fights to make-ups, when a kiss occurs following up \\"I love you,\\" there is no where to store those thoughts and excitements. Nonetheless, towards the end emotions drop into sadness and sorrow because the reader discovers Jamie is diagnosed with Leukemia. The way that Sparks encourages emotions results into a creation of a superb romance.    Overall, A Walk to Remember is advancement in literature with its description of characters, theme, and emotions. Personally, I adored A Walk to Remember, I believe this proficient work of romance is a must read between the teen and older society.

B003P2WO5E|5.0|I've read all of Sanderson's books, and The Way of Kings is among the best.  I'm very excited about the future of the Stormlight Archives.  The character development and story is simply awe inspiring.  I've always like Brandon's style of writing, and I'd have to say this is his best written book.  I can't wait for the rest of the series!!!!!!
1439181780|5.0|I just finished reading this book and as a huge fan of \\"The Secret\\" I wasn't disappointed. It's a true next step in developing your awareness and in some ways a simpler way to truly \\"live\\" the secret. This is one of those books that needs to be read over and over again. I know I have read \\"the secret\\" and watched it so many times that I've lost count. This is a book that should be revisited many times in your life. It simply takes that many times to truly sink into your soul and reshape your thoughts. Of course, if you've truly started soaking in \\"the secret\\" this book will propel you to even greater love and life. In summary, please read this book and enjoy life.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|Wonderful acting, Romola Garai and Jonny Lee Miller are just incredible in this Jane Austen classic.  His rendition of Mr. Knightly would have to be my favorite.  Also, I like that in this version, the relationship between Emma and her father is more thoroughly developed, you really feel how much they love each other.    The rendition of Mr. Churchill and Jane Fairfax was also well acted, not my favorites but they did an adequate job.    All in all, a beautiful version!!
B00005JKJA|4.0|Many of us have seen bad movies: movies that exhibit the director's lack of visionary technique. I must say that Mulholland Drive is not one of those films, because it seems this film has a strong intention. David Lynch is a visionary director, and sometimes his aesthetic presentation supercedes his ability to tell a good story; but sometimes--for me--when one element of a film is done extremely well, it drowns out some of the film's other shortcomings. For example, his adaptation of Dune was awful. I'll admit, the film sported some interesting effects for its time, but the film's execution was very poor, as certain details were too diluted and certain characters presented and then forgotten. In Mulholland Dr. it almost seems that Lynch pays a homage to his ability to create effective mood and his sometimes inability to tell a coherent story. There are so many great scenes in this film that could have led to so many other plot turns, but don't seem to tie into the film as a whole.-- I began watching it expecting one thing, and once the credits rolled, I realized that coming into this movie with expectations was a waste of time.    I read a review by Roger Ebert, who raved about this film, and he pointed out that Lynch is creating dreamscapes in Mulholland Dr.: scenes that work single-handedly but do not continue into the thread of typical narrative. It seems Lynch is taking a daring step here, because a movie like this has never been done before. I enjoyed this film primarily on an aesthetic level. While watching it, I felt like I was in a dream, and that was perhaps what the director was attempting to do: transport --the viewers--into a living dream.     Do I agree with many that maybe this movie was overspeculated and that Lynch is propbably in his work study, laughing at all of us for overanalyzing his film? Probably. But a movie like Mulholland Dr., despite its purpose, should be analyzed because that is why it was made. We can all probably agree that the film is not mainstream; it does not follow the typical Hollywood narrative formula. It can be analyzed as a cynical director's idea of poking fun at the whole idea of criticizing and dissecting film, or it can be viewed as a narrative experiment, in which case other elements of the film need to be allowed to resonate above the overall script.    All in all, what I can definitely say is that Mulholland Dr. is like no movie-viewing experience you've ever had before. Will you be confused? Probably. Will you jump to random (maybe fruitless) conclusions as to what you feel the ending meant? Definitely. But, to me, that is part of the entire experience. Let Lynch have a good laugh, because, let's face it, I had one hell of a great laugh after watching the garbage that was his film, Dune (which was an attempt to be coherent, but was not...and I doubt the director was making a social commentary there), but Mulholland Dr. is more tonally immersive and, after viewing it, you'll literally feel like you have just stepped out of a beautifully haunting nightmare.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|If you're the type of person that likes the journey, regardless of the destination, Lost may be worth it. But if you like a story ending that actually makes sense and ties together all previous story arcs, don't waste your time or money on this series.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|I'm a huge Gregg Allman and Allman Bros. fan. I waited 6 months for this CD. Well, it was worth the wait and I'm sure the producer deserves some credit. But, awesome Cd and an immediate classic. Allman has the vocals and ideas to give us valuable and theraputic music.
B003L20IDI|3.0|I was looking for a way to kill some time today and it was either The Adjustment Bureau or Rango. Since I wasn't in the mood for animation and after reading more good than bad reviews, I went with this mixing of multiple genres. You have your thriller and sci-fi elements, but also a larger than expected dose of romance.<br /><br />As shown countless times in the trailers, we are all being watched and adjusted by a mysterious group of people. They remind me of the bald Observer characters on the great TV show Fringe. They keep us on track to hopefully maximize our individual potential and to prevent the human race as a whole from utter destruction. Matt Damon's character is a politician running for Senate and falls for a girl, played by Emily Blunt, which clashes with such plan. Thanks to a mistake from one of the observing agents, he meets her again on a bus by chance and The Adjustment Bureau will stop at nothing to make sure their connection is severed.<br /><br />Damon and Blunt are both likeable and have decent chemistry, but there just is not enough material to really sink your teeth into. It would have worked better as maybe a 30-45 minute segment in an anthology. Still, the idea behind the film is pretty cool and I was never bored, even though the pacing isn't what anyone would call fast. I don't regret seeing it, but I wish it would have been on a much smaller screen. This is one you can wait three months for.
6305907145|4.0|I loved all of the movie that involved Fanny and Edmund.  I was not crazy about the relationship between Henry Crawford and Maria Bertram, that so much was shown, I feel like just to give the movie a more adult rating.  Otherwise though, a wonderful movie.
B004Q3SGWG|5.0|I JUST finished watching this movie, and I don't regret a single penny. This is one of the best movies I have seen in a while , plus it's based on a true story , it's just amazing. I totally recomend
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I've read all three and i enjoyed the first book. It was a fun, light read. I am amazed at how many reviewers think this is a great work of art. It's not. I think books 2 and 3 in the series are repetitive. So, I'd suggest you might want to skip the next two books if you agree with my opinion of the first. But if you think Collins is our next Hemingway, read on.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|I loved the original, still I gotta say this version was probably the best American vampire film ever made. Cody Smit-Mcphee and Chloe Moretz both delivered amazing performances and the fimography was beautiful.    Due to the fact that they both have the same soource material, they have alot of similar scenes and dialogue. Still, both movies are very diferent takes on the story, So don't think just because you saw the first one that \\"Let Me In\\" isn't worth watching. It included some things from the book that the sweedish book didnt and focused much more on the relationship between Abbey and Owen than the swedish movie.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I purchased this to try to get away from using both hands for hotkeys in World of Warcraft. Using the mouse is an integral part of the game, but so is using hotkeys. I just didn't have enough with one hand so I was using two and then failing miserably when I needed to use my mouse (i.e. turning and target changing). I decided to get this to give me more hotkeys accessible with one hand which would allow me to use the mouse. It was very frustrating at first as my muscle memory had a really hard time unlearning what it had been doing for 4 years, but once I started to get the hang of it, it was great. Kinda like going from two finger typing to homerow typing. I found it was great for other games as well (I have used it for left 4 dead 1&2, Borderlands, and others) as it has 4 memory buttons to quickly switch keybindings with just a key press. It also has profiles within each memory button that can be changed almost as quickly (it's a drop down box within the logitech profile manager. Just keep a quick launch icon on your taskbar or desktop). I do wish it had more memory buttons so I could have one for each of my characters on WoW, but technically you could get away with only one as I don't think there's a limit to how many profiles you could have per button. So far I've had no issues with key response and they have a solid feel to them with no wiggling or play. The palm rest is very ergonomic and doesn't lend itself to hand/wrist fatigue. It's also relatively portable. I travel for work so I have a gaming laptop I take with me and I tote the g13 along as well. It doesn't take up much space in my bag and isn't heavy (though I suppose that's subjective. I don't know the actual weight), but most importantly your profiles can be quickly exported and transfered to another pc. I actually just emailed the file to myself (it's only a couple of KB) so I can access it from anywhere in case I need to.
B003EV6DBM|2.0|I am dumbfounded at the number of people giving this incarnation of Dr Who good reviews. I've watched Dr. Who since I was a kid in the 70's. Most recently, I loved both Christopher and David as the Dr. (David Tennant is my fellow sci-fi friends and my favorite)<br />This new Dr is so boring and bland I could barely stand to watch. Even the stories are dull and lack any real humor. We all tried to get into this new incarnation and none of my group can find something to like. I would say to anyone reading reviews before buying; Watch a few episodes first and decide for yourself. I guess it's all very subjective. But if you ask this Sci-fi fanatic, the newest Dr Who sucks and falls WAY flat of filling any of the previous Doctor's shoes.
0066620996|1.0|I got this book based on the rating and general popularity, but I was saddened to see it for what it really was, a padded out essay. The author repeats the whole \\"good to great\\" mantra in different ways over and over and over again to take up space, the few stories would make for a good essay length paper, but to fill a book he has to hammer the same point over and over again.
B004M54NWU|5.0|There are fewer and fewer movies these days that take real life scenarios and create a script that is powerful and moving.

B002RSDW80|4.0|I have to say, I am probably biased in regards to this movie because its about food, and there are surprisingly few films within the genre of foodie movies.  And I love food.<br /><br />Julie Powell has set herself a mission since her life doesn't seem to be going anywhere.  She is going to cook through Julia Child's The Art of French Cooking in a year, and blog about it.  Not such a big task some might think?  Well, over 500 recipes in 365 days is kind of a big deal, especially when some include boning a duck.  While she is navigating through this humongous task (and having it affect her life and marriage) we are given glimpses of Julia Child's life in Paris and how she started cooking and writing cookbooks.<br /><br />Meryl Streep-Julia Child<br />Amy Adams-Julie Powell<br />Stanley Tucci-Paul Child<br />Chris Messina-Eric Powell<br />Linda Emond-Simone Beck<br />Helen Carey-Louisette Bertholle<br />Jane Lynch-Dorothy McWilliams<br /><br />For casting I think they did a great job.  Meryl Streep was amazing as Julia Child and while I have not really watched too much of The French Chef show on PBS I could definitely see the similarities.  She and Stanley Tucci had great chemistry as well and it was a pleasure to watch them interact together and their love felt genuine.  Amy Adams I'm not as big a fan of in any movie, but I think she did ok here.  In my opinion Julie was a bit of a brat but I suppose no one can be perfect.  I did like her husband played by Chris Messina, but have to say that the way he eats was a little unappetizing.  Most surprising to me was when my fiance pointed out Julia's sister and shouted Glee!  Sure enough once pointed out I was able to recognize Jane Lynch and had a little giggle.<br /><br />There weren't any special effects really in this movie but it was filmed rather well.  The times felt authentic and the shots of the food just wonderful.  I could feel my mouth watering as all these people got to eat fabulous dinners and I didn't even get a taste.  I love to cook myself though and perhaps this will hurry me along to buying a copy of The Art of French Cooking to give a try (except the aspics, eek).  The movie did get slow in a few parts and just like Julie's husband, I got tired of watching some of her meltdowns and wished it would have focused more on some of her successful creations from Julia's book.<br /><br />As a warning, this movie does contain some adult language and themes and while I found the uses hilarious, others may not.<br /><br />It is a very foodie movie and while I wish some techniques had been highlighted, or recipes shared, I can't really complain too much because it was about food and it really was interesting to see the history behind both Julia and Julie (who's book Julie and Julia is actually in my pile of books to read soon).

B00475AYJQ|5.0|Boy, does Pat Rothfuss know how to spin a tale? If the third one is as good as this one, I am almost not going to mind waiting for a long time. This one is much, much more mature than \\"The Name of the Wind\\", as is Kvothe. The storytelling is not pathbreaking by any stretch of imagination, but the way the Author tells the story is fantastic. Yes, the book is too long and doesn't work like a novel and leap forward in resolving the book's central crisis, but you hardly notice these small quibbles, when you are rush headlong in the flow of the story. In fact, for over a week, I couldn't think of anything else but the book. Now, it's time for a headlong dive in to \\"The Crippled god\\"[[ASIN:0756404738 The Wise Man's Fear (Kingkiller Chronicles, Day 2)]]

I'm glad she changed it up but \\"Some People Have Real Problems\\" will probably always be my favorite!

020530902X|5.0|This book was originally published in the 1930's and after 49 editions, is still one of the best selling books about writing. It covers all the basics in 95 concise pages, in a book small enough to fit in a pocket. Reviews say things like, \\"No book in shorter space, with fewer words, will help any writer more than this persistent little volume.\\" \\"...should be the daily companion of anyone who writes for a living and, for that matter, anyone who writes at all.\\"<br /><br />It has competitors. Consider:<br /><br />  * Garner's Modern American Usage<br />  * Bernstein's The Careful Writer<br />  * Jack Hart's A Writers Coach<br /><br />...but still, Strunk and White is the most famous, most oft-quoted, most consistently recommended of any. Amazon ranks it #1 in writing skills, #1 in grammar and #9 in reference. It's the 555th most popular book on the entire site.<br /><br />Why is that?<br /><br />Look at the Table of Contents:<br /><br />  * Elementary Rules of Usage, which lists eleven rules--the eleven most relevant to writers<br />  * Elementary Principles of Composition--This includes eleven also, with items like use the active voice, put statements in positive form, omit needless words.

Although these were considered important rules in the 1930's and are the same issues faced by writers today. Maybe that's why it's still one of the best-selling, most popular books ever.

The more Kvothe reveals about himself, the more complex he becomes. While the tenants of what drive his character are fairly standard, as laid out in The Name of the Wind, in The Wise Man's Fear, it's more than that. He is no longer driven only by his desire to seek the Chandrian, and his boyish enthusiasm is reducing like sauce in a pot. He is still compulsive, still witty and clever, but his determination has become much more mature. His actions are now weighted not by outside events, but by his own self-made past. And while he still possesses a healthy amount of idiocy to go along with his numerous geniuses, the core of his character remains the same. This is splendid and subtle work. If any still harbor the mistaken illusion of Kvothe's status as a Mary Sue, The Wise Man's Fear should dispel that.    The world expands quite a bit, which is impressive considering how much ground was tread in The Name of the Wind. Since the specifics of sygaldry and sympathy were laid out in detail prior, there is little page space wasted on retreading it, outside of one or two discussions. But the Four Corners is slowly being filled with detail. What were before offered as dialogue asides or quick mentions by Kvothe in the first book, in this one the ground is actually being tread, and we're being shown the differences in culture, the differences in storytelling, the differences in folklore. Though the folklore isn't as weighty a presence as it was in The Name of the Wind, it is still striking and still extremely compelling.    The plot is wonderfully constructed, and though the book shares some of the excesses of the first one, the plot is different enough and deep enough to keep a reader's attention even through parts that may drag along a little too far. This is no simple three-act-and-outstory; it possesses a complexity that is well told enough to resemble real life in a fantastical world. The same is true in this book as it was in its progenitor: while the trappings of fantasy are very present down to the window-dressings, the plot itself ably subverts typical genre clichés while staying true to the roots of the genre.    There is quite a bit more darkness in this go-round as well. The Name of the Wind tended to hint more at the darker edges of the world without ever really exploring them. That is not so in Wise Man's Fear. Rape and banditry and murder are front and center in the main plot, and Kvothe doesn't simply watch it happening, or hear of it through word of mouth. In some instances, Kvothe himself partakes. Make no mistake, this is a book for adults. It never strays too deeply into the heavier elements to turn a reader away, though, and compared with a few other contemporary fantasy authors, Rothfuss' treatment of the violence is surprisingly PG-13.    But for all that, and I could go on quite a lot longer, saying what other people have already said, there are faults. Lots of them. To follow up a small complaint I had with The Name of the Wind: like Kvothe at \\"interesting fact,\\" the map is crap. It is too vague to be of any real use outside of locating Tarbean, The University, and Imre. Local details in any flavor are completely overlooked, giving us a map so broad as to be next to useless in any real sense. The story would function perfectly well without it.    The excesses, while excusable, are much more present in this volume than in the first. While The Name of the Wind was new and unique enough to turn even an old hand at fantasy into a wide-eyed child delighting in finding something new and shiny to look at, The Wise Man's Fear has lost some of the wonder of the setting. Plot asides and tangential stories are slightly more tiring, and some of them get an extremely close focus while other are breezed over as being unimportant. Skipping the shipwreck in favor of spending at least two hundred pages in the Ademre, for instance, is understandable, but the book still drags a bit during his stay with the Adem. The time we spend being told of all the little nuances speaks more of Rothfuss' desire to show a bit more of his (undeniably fascinating) culture than it does of Kvothe's need to get that part of the story told. I would much rather know how his lute case saved his life than be shown a whole lot of vague and melodramatically named sword-stances.    Not to say that it isn't enjoyable, but I feel like it underlies a larger fault of the book as a whole: it is simply too long. 994 hardcover pages isn't a novel, it's a tome. With a few tweaks, it could easily be two much more thoroughly detailed books, but I respect Rothfuss for trimming where he could to get his series in at a healthy three books, instead of dragging us along for four or five or, sticking with his love of folklore, seven entries into Kvothe's story. But it must be said that there is more to this book than there needed to be. While any sacrifice would likely lead to the same complaint (glossing over one area in favor of another, etc), the volume of story we're told is simply staggering, and were it not for Rothfuss' ability to pack in pages worth of detail in a few paragraphs, the book would likely be 1200 pages instead of just 1000.    The third-person framing story still has a jarring difference in tone and diction than the first-person narrative, as well. The framing chapters come off as slightly cartoonish and heavily melodramatic. Kvothe, for instance, says \\"Bast\\" nearly every time he talks to his friend. And not just once or twice in a scatter of dialogue, no: once in each line. This is either something incredibly subtle that Kvothe has to do in order to keep Bast under control, which I am entirely willing to concede as a possibility, or it is a glaring error of proofreading. Either way, the constant repetition is annoying and either needs to be trimmed or explained in the final installment. Bast himself behaves rather more like a puppet, leaping up and down and shouting quite a lot more than is necessary. A little bit of subtlety during the framing scenes would make a dramatic improvement to the book overall.    As a story of a storyteller telling his own story, the book obviously caters to a few excesses. Elements of Rothfuss' worldbuilding certainly fall into this category, as Kvothe goes out of his way to explain things that should be assumed by a member of that world; he even mentions this on one occasion, but seems to ignore his own advice. But for all that, it hardly matters. More worrying is the constant air of mysterious cleverness that Kvothe always maintains, in the first-person and third-person narratives. His encounter on his way back to Severen from Ademre, for instance, is told in a way that makes little sense. Where before Kvothe had always been careful to preface certain surprising actions with a bit of a lead up - look to Kvothe's numerous allusions to his and Ambrose's increasingly dangerous feud in The Name of the Wind for contrast - in this case he just brashly overtreads the subtle details, and the reader is left holding one end of a bloodied sword before he explains what was going on. There certainly are subtle details, but these are details that would work much better in a third-person narrative than a first-person story, especially given the hindsight-granted omniscience that Kvothe wields. The scene worked, and it was surprising, but I think it was surprising for the wrong reasons.     On the same note, Rothfuss seems to go out of his way to make things much more mysterious than I think they need to be. To me, it seems as if the stage crew come out and begin moving the scenery offstage and roll the curtains forward during the middle of a scene; it doesn't really add to mystery, it just nakedly reveals that these elements are Super Mysterious and cannot be revealeduntil act IV. The story could deal with a few more tangible facts and not suffer from it, considering how little we know of what is going on with Kvothe in the \\"present,\\" what is going on in the wider world. We don't even know where the Waystone is, and that is a striking lack of clarity for a story that is usually brimming with detail. Furthermore, important characters who had been implicated in extremely important (not to mention jacket-mentioned) plot points are dealt with offstage with little but a few offhand remarks, which was a little disappointing.    And there are small surface issues as well; a few misspellings and a smattering of small typos, but nothing book-breaking. For all that, The Wise Man's Fear is still an incredibly rich and detailed read, and it ranks among the best fantasy of the past decade for a certainty. Mistakes and all - all of which are arguable, of course - Rothfuss is still a gifted storyteller and his character is even more fascinating this time around. I eagerly await the release of The Kingkiller Chronicles, Day Three, and I anticipate more than a few rereads of The Wise Man's Fear in the future.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|OOPS, I AM SORRY. I DIDN'T REALIZE THERE IS A DELUXE CD. I guess sense I listened to it first on iTunes I didn't pay attention to that, and I WAS VERY TIRED. I THINK I WILL EVENTUALLY GET THE DELUXE EDITION, AND GIVE THIS CD THAT I BOUGHT TO A FRIEND. THE DELUXE EDITION IS PRETTY EXPENSIVE!I bought the cd  after I heard my brother's downloaded one from iTunes,and there is a song featuring Beyonce. I listened to it 2 days before Christmas. :-) I couldn't stop listening to it. WHY IS THE SONG FEATURING BEYONCE NOT ON THIS ALBUM? I had just came back to America from India. I had major jet lag and hearing this album made me feel a lot better. I couldn't sleep because I was still on another time zone, and listening to this album helped me stimulate my mind when I couldn't sleep. Hey, maybe I also couldn't sleep because I was so excited about the album;I couldn't lay down and stop listening to it. He has amazing collaborations with other artists. The poetry at the end of the album was well written and it makes you think. Like always, Kanye's lyrics make many of us laugh, replay a lyric to make sure we heard what he said right and most importantly they make us think. Nicki Minaj is a MAJOR BONUS TO THIS ALBUM. I just wish I could hear the song with Beyonce! :-(  Can anyone explain this to me? Thanks and One Love, Ashleigh Thompson
B0043EV774|5.0|This is the best 3d movie that I've seen on my screen so far....I found it was so easy to get into the story because there was little ghosting and the effects were just tremendous...really a lot of fun
1400079144|4.0|Just more of what I expect from Dan Brown.  Makes me wonder if he has gone off the deep end. I have not yet finished reading the Lost Symbol but I have no problem with Amazon.  It was what I ordered and what I wanted to read.  Wonder if he is planning another, more bizarre story...
B004BLJQOK|4.0|I saw the American adaptation before I saw the Swedish one which was a mistake because I have to admit I am bit more partial to the American adaptation. The original film is great but the dubs are so terrible that it does take away from the film. Anyhow, I would highly recommend this film. Let Me In is not your typical guts and horror film which is nice, you're actually told a story...and it's a good one!
044654759X|5.0|There is a certain kind of peace that comes with settling in to a Nicholas Sparks novel. Emotional turmoil is a given, and one can rest assured there will nearly always be beautiful scenery interspersed throughout the stormy seasons; characters will triumph over obstacles; and the story line never falters from its final destination; much like the tide reaches out to touch the shore; a Nicholas Sparks novel is oftentimes much like coming home.<br /><br />My heart felt such redemption at reading the main character, Katie's P.O.V., how it really feels when one tries so hard to get away and start anew. Personally, there were so many feelings finally validated by reading this novel. Feelings I have tried to put into words on many occasions and failed.<br /><br />I got a sense that the writer has a real grasp on the emotional toll a domestic abuse survivor must overcome. The story moves along at such a crisp pace that even stubborn readers could spend a few days chipping along and get it read. Sometimes there is a lot that can be said about not necessarily an easy read; but a read that most people can understand, relate to, and succeed in finishing. Not every book appeals to every reader, but Nicholas Sparks seems to have the right formula down for catching the most readers, and that is quite a feat, Bravo!<br /><br />The surprise sea breeze of Jo will make stars stream across the darkest night sky, fetching quick tears; as of the flash of God's great goodness in today's cruel world.  There is much light to be found in Safe Haven; the kind of sunset that lingers long after the evening has dropped her darkest nets across this life.
B003YYZ306|5.0|The variety in the modern take on these retro-flavored original tunes is fantastic. The band plays very well together for a clean and well-thought out sound that doesn't come across as over-processed. It's still gritty and down and dirty, just the way something vintage ought to be. But flawless at the same time. Ty Taylor's vocals range from blues, jazz, rock and soul effortlessly, and the lyrics are worth many repeat listenings. When I play this at the office, people always come in asking \\"who is that great sound?\\" Very danceable, but also melancholy.
1416583432|2.0|I expected a book with information based upon both experience and research.  Sadly, I found a writer who needs to improve both her grammar and clarity.  She is far too verbose.  I would never take a course from such an instructor.
0061900656|4.0|This updated version, illustrated by Rosalinda Kightley, is better than the original. The original never showed the mother holding the baby whereas the new version does, a couple of times. Neither version shows breastfeeding but the new version cuts back on the bottle feeding at least.  My son loves this book and we have tried many. He is 28 months old and most books are too old for him or too detailed to capture his attention. We first borrowed this book from the library, along with all of the others we've tried, and had to buy it after renewing it 3 times.  I also like the fact that the book does not address negative feelings the older sibling may have.  We'll cross that bridge when we come to it;  why give him any ideas? Another great choice on this subject is On Mother's Lap by Ann Herbert Scott. My son also loves the Sesame Street video Three Bears and a New Baby. If you are looking for a parenting book for yourself on this subject, try Welcoming Your Second Baby, by Vicky Lansky or Keys to Preparing and Caring for Your Second Child, by Meg Zweiback. Avoid the book From One Child to Two, by Judy Dunn. Dunn's book was so indecisive and negative, we might not be having another child after reading it if I hadn't already been pregnant.
B002RL7W9W|5.0|This was a small gift for my six year old grandson.  He loved it and wanted the extra pieces for all of his play with his Lego toys.  Lego in general is one of the best toys I have ever seen.  My own children owned them and my grandchildren play with some of those original pieces that are now 40 years old.  Today with all of the kits, the sky is the limit with what they can design and build.  They allow unlimited creativity in play.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|As others have pointed out, this is a great movie. The story at it's core is about friendship, and how true friendship transcends all things - even death. The story was moving from an artistic sense, but when you find out the back story (based on true events) at the end, it makes one appreciate the story all the more.<br /><br />The acting in this movie was fantastic. I would put Richard Gere's performance in this film on par with his work in 'Pretty Woman.' Similarly Joan Allen's and Sarah Roemer's acting  was superb.<br /><br />This movie is a definite keeper and should be part of everyone's movie collection.
B0025KVLV0|4.0|great classic rock. the beatles last album, which i have on album and wanted the cd for my collection.  brings back alot of memories
B00192IV9U|5.0|Putting aside the controversy about whether or not some of songs are \\"authentically\\" Michael's voice, I think this is a fine collection of songs.  I've been a fan since he was that little dynamo in the J-5.  I followed his career and loved Off the Wall and the succeeding albums.  I'll admit, I've not listened to every song on some of the J-5 albums, but I've studied his voice on every solo album he's released over the years.  It's his voice on every one of these tracks.  Yes, he was a perfectionist.  Would these songs all have been released in the manner they appear had he lived to record them?  We'll never know.  Teddy Riley, Frank Cascio, Neff-U, etc. did a great job finishing them.  It's always hard to pick a favorite song but I really do love  The Way That You Love Me.  It's so special to hear him say....\\"this is the tempo and this the melody\\" and hear him create the sound of the drums.  I'd have given anything to be in the studio with him, watching the music just flow from him.  He really was pure genius!  I like this version and  the original, too.  His voice is so clear and sweet and it's a beautiful melody you can't help but sing along to.  I actually like his singing with Lenny Kravitz (I Can't Make It) more than the duo with Akon.  It was too much Akon--not enough MJ.  Regardless, Hold My Hand is a beautiful song.  Behind The Mask is just the best.  Strong, vibrant, Michael; great vocal range and the sax, well, I've always loved great sax!    Breaking News is a \\"heart-breaker\\".  His question, \\"Why is it strange that I would fall in love?\\" (referring to his love for and marriage to Lisa Marie Presley) makes me sad. The media helped to wreck that marriage.  Plus, she betrayed him.  It's another song written in response to a vicious media who, as he notes in the song, \\"wrote his obituary\\" in June 2009.    Best of Joy is innocent, pure, sweet, youthful Michael.  Yes, Michael, you are forever!  Monster is kick-a$$!  I love 50-Cent's rap and again, Michael is strong and bad in his \\"dissin'\\" the slimy papparazzi.  Keep Your Head Up is \\"classic\\" compassionate, caring Michael.  Always thinking about the underprivileged and the struggling underdog.  It makes you feel for that young mother.  It makes you believe in hope.  Michael was all about hope.  Hollywood Tonight is a song for every young, aspiring person who thinks that Hollywood is the be-all, end-all.  A quick look at Lindsay Lohan and Charlie Sheen and you'll understand that Hollywood fame is NOT all that it's cracked up to be.    Much Too Soon gives me the feeling that he wrote it in response to a love affair that didn't turn out the way he hoped it would.  Again, his vocals are so beautiful.   He wrote simply and from the heart.  This song was truly heartfelt.  I wish $ony (I dislike them intensely!) would re-release Invincible.  The songs on that CD are among the best he's ever written--beautiful ballads and great beats (2000 Watts).  Clearly, $ony sabotaged that CD when it was first released.  They practically stopped promoting it because of contractual differences.  If Invincible were released today, I believe it would go to #1 and stay there for a long time--the songs are still so timely and relevant.  Michael is Michael, through and through.  It makes you appreciate that we can still hear more of his genius creativity, but terribly sad that from now on, no matter how beautifully mixed his yet-to-be released work is, it will always lack his magical finishing touch.    If you love him, you'll put controversy aside and include it in your collection.    Now, if only $ony will finally release What More Can I Give, Do You Know Where Your Children Are, and the great short film, Ghosts.  A remaster of Moonwalker would be really great, too!
0312944926|1.0|This book is one of the worst I have ever read. I read this after reading a few of Dans other books but this one was painful to read. I could not wait to finish this tripe and almost threw it away mid way through. I had to force myself to finish it. Don't waste your time or money with this turkey.

B003PIUBZS|5.0|I am on the LOVE side.  I actually can't believe that an eye-candy series has a GREAT story!  Don't use this to write a report.  It's entertaining and extremely loaded with everything that premium cable can bring.  I'm not afraid to admit that the full-frontal aspect made this an even more enjoyable experience.  Glad that creators are starting to make shows that have no limits.    Also, the prequel is amazing.  Looking forward to the second season with new Spartacus, Liam McIntyre.
0520224787|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. Every page is exciting. The characters are memorable. I read this book about a year ago and I still think about it periodically. I can't read (classical) chinese, but my impression of the translation is very good. I think it reflects the terse quality of the original writing style without being hard to read.     The notes and the second half of the story are in part two, also available from amazon: [[ASIN:0520225031 Three Kingdoms: A Historical Novel, Part 2 (v. 2)]]. The two volumes should really be sold together. The table of contents for both volumes is in volume one and the notes for both volumes are in volume two. For some reason most of the amazon reviews for this book are on the page for the second volume. If you purchased just this volume and don't want to read it without the notes, don't be discouraged! I read through the entire volume without the notes and my enjoyment was not diminished. The notes are mostly translation details, historical notes, or references to various classic analyses of Three Kingdoms.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|\\"Mockingjay\\" follows the continuing story of heroine Katniss Everdeen as she defies the Capital against the Hunger Games.  In this entry, Katniss returns to District 12 to find it bombed out, and rebellions have broken out throughout the other districts.  Once again, she's faced with a difficult choice - to retreat or to fully embrace her role as the Mockingjay.  Not surprisingly, our heroine jumps into action, although she is clearly unhappy about the part she is to play.  Plus, she quickly finds that she may have a new set of enemies of whom she needs to be wary.<br /><br />The third novel in the Hunger Games series represents a definite shift in plot and a bit of a change in tone from the first two books.  \\"Mockingjay\\" focuses much more explicitly on the cost of war, short and long-term.  As a result, the plot is a bit more slow-moving and dark, and Katniss' frequent withdrawals from the action are frustrating at times.  However, everything makes sense given the events of the first two books, and I admire author Suzanne Collins for not easing up here.  It would have been very easy to give everyone rosy endings, but instead the result is much more mixed and therefore realistic.  What emerges is a rather dire portrait of human nature and our tendency toward violence as a solution; what's most frightening is its accuracy.  As a trilogy, the Hunger Games are pretty spectacular and seem destined to become classics.
B003L20ID8|2.0|\\"The Adjustment Bureau\\" addresses favorite, and much-contested, themes: the role of fate, or chance, or free will in our lives. Theologians, scientists, theists and atheists have puzzled over these questions for thousands of years. The film posits an official bureaucracy that massages everyday human activities - whether or not rising young political star David Norris (Matt Damon) spills coffee on his shirt during his morning commute through a park, whether Elise Sallas (Emily Blunt), a dancer, falls and sprains her ankle onstage - in order to achieve the outcomes the Adjustment Bureau desires. It's a fantastic premise, which the film thoroughly wastes.<br /><br />David Norris is a rising political star; Elise Sallas is a rising dancer. They meet and fall in love at first sight. Their love defies the desired ends of the Adjustment Bureau. The Adjustment Bureau may be carrying out the will of God, and its caseworkers may be angels. The film never makes it clear. Hats give the Adjustment Bureau's caseworkers their power. Yes, hats, exactly the kind of snap-brim hat that Frank Sinatra made famous in the 1950s. (Thus the title of the tribute book, \\"The Way You Wear Your Hat.\\") Too, Adjustment Bureau case workers refer to their boss, who may be God, as \\"The Chairman.\\" They don't mean Mao - this must be a reference to Sinatra, nicknamed \\"Chairman of the Board.\\" I'm sorry, but this film was so boring, it sent my mind down these trails.<br /><br />When the Adjustment Bureau made its presence known, and revealed its near omnipotence over David Norris' fate, I didn't care. I felt no anxiety for David or Elise. The film evoked no sense of mystery, not even the shiver you get when you think of a friend and that friend immediately phones you. I kept thinking of other films that introduced supernatural, fate-altering others into average mortal's lives. Cary Grant as the angel Dudley in \\"The Bishop's Wife\\" caused more of a sense of wonder and awe. In \\"Portrait of Jenny,\\" another movie about a fated relationship, there's a scene of ice-skaters in Central Park. The scene is very wholesome and suitable for family viewing. It's shot in black and white. Even so, with no special effects, it creates a powerful sense of the weird that \\"Adjustment Bureau\\" never matches.<br /><br />Matt Damon plays, as he always does, Matt Damon: an oversmart, internal guy who keeps his cards close to his chest and doesn't so much relate to others as manipulate them to his own purposes. He was brilliant at this in \\"Good Will Hunting\\" and he's been good at it ever since.<br /><br />Emily Blunt is not his best partner. She's a great dominatrix, as she was in \\"The Devil Wears Prada,\\" or \\"Young Victoria.\\" Her crispness never penetrates Damon's emotional armor, as did Minnie Driver in \\"Hunting\\" with her over-the-top emotionality.<br /><br />I never felt that David and Elise were experiencing the kind of love worthy of the risks they take in the movie, and I really did not care whether they were together at the end or not.<br /><br />Because the movie didn't grab me, I noticed all the plot holes I would not have seen had I been swept up in movie magic. The Adjustment Bureau teams are thrown off their game by rain. But they're shown to be almost omnipotent. Why rain? Throw me a bone, here! Hats make them powerful? HATS? There are simply too many Adjustment Bureau personnel. They're like a bumbling team of Keystone Cops, chasing about, and accomplishing very little. They don't intimidate or impress us. They don't make us go, \\"Wow!\\"<br /><br />Any discussion of fate, chance, free will and God invokes huge questions. Why does God allow the innocent to suffer, for example? Do we really control our own fates, or are we merely puppets in the hands of the Gods? The movie attempts to address this in a monologue by Terence Stamp. He says that the height of civilization was the Roman Empire. Yes, that same Roman Empire that crucified six thousand slaves along the Appian Way, and entertained its masses with scenes of wild animals feasting on human flesh. Stamp then denigrates the so-called \\"Dark Ages,\\" a misnomer intended to make the Christian Europe that arose after the fall of the Roman Empire look bad. Oh, how silly.<br /><br />In order to establish that David Norris is a man on the move, the film uses fake news clips of real personalities, including Jon Stewart and other television news commentators. The careful and extensive inclusion of these real personalities betrays the film's failure. Who cares if Jon Stewart is in a movie about love, fate, God, chance? Don't give me Jon Stewart and Mary Matalin; I can see them on TV. Make a work of art that makes me think something I've never thought before.ing on human flesh.

B003L77G6A|3.0|I loved the first three seasons of this show but my complaint is that there are getting to be to many characters. I eventually got used to Amy but I lost all interest in Howards girl. He was much funnier when he was on the constant prowl. It seems to me too many things and people are being crammed in each episode.
0143034901|5.0|It is no wonder that this book was a New York Times Bestseller. It is amazing. I didn't want it to end! This book had everything. Suspense, mystery, love, intrigue, tragedy, and humor. When 10-year-old Daniel begins to fear he is forgetting the image of his deceased mother, his father, who owns a bookstore, takes Daniel to the mysterious Cemetery of Forgotten Books. Daniel chooses a book called Shadow of the Wind and becomes intent on reading other novels by the mysterious author. In his search, Daniel becomes caught up in a web of deceit and mystery that only grows the more he learns. Aided by a humorous homeless man he befriends, the two scour Barcelona in search of the reason the author's books are being destroyed. All the while, the two are being stalked by those who wish to destroy all traces of the author books and the author himself. The story was so mysterious and suspenseful I could not even guess what was coming next. It was everything that a good suspenseful mystery should be. I highly recommend it.
B002BWP4A6|4.0|I rented \\"The White Ribbon\\" solely on the basis of it's nomination for a Best Foreign Language Oscar.  That category has almost always worked for me.  I read the film's synopsis and it sounded reasonably interesting.  I was aprehensive about the length of the movie so I started watching it one night with the expectation to finish watching it the next night.  It was hard to tear myself away from it and I was anxious to see the rest of it the next evening.  I would describe it as one of a few films I've seen that comes across as a serious movie while also giving you goose bumps.  This black and white movie was excellently filmed and the acting was superb even with a large cast of children.  It tells of a series of accidents and tragedies in a small German village on the Eve of WWI.  That aspect turns out to be more important that you might suspect but I can't exactly tell you why.  Let's just said WWI serves as an excellent point of departure leaving a mystery unsolved.     The characters are well-presented and we sympathize with some, detest a few others, and serously wonder about some of the rest.  The narrator serves as a source of balance but he, too, does not know what is really going on.  I was sorry for the way \\"The White Ribbon\\" ended but I gradually began to realize that the ending gave it a much greater impact. (Will we see \\"Return to White Ribbon\\"? Hopefully not but I'm sure many would like to see it).  Unfortunately, after watching the movie, I read a lot of comments about the film being an introductary explanation of the Holocaust.  The professional review cited above says that the director, Michael Haneke, often leaves his purposes undefined.  So why the great leap that so many have taken????  Let's get this straight, I have seen dozens and dozens of movies of that generation and other generations where the definition of loving your children seems to be the coldly calculated way you administer discipline.  The films I recall took place in many countriesbut the feeling I always seemed to get was that, despite his many faults, Dr. Benjamin Spock did us kids a big favor.  There was never any suggestion that there, but for the grace of God, goes another generation bent on cultural destruction and racial annihilation.  Enjoy this tense drama and skip the grandiosity of its' suggested purpose.
0307595579|5.0|Note: I am reviewing the books in general, not the editions contained in the set.      Lizbeth Salander is a strange individual. She is terse, antisocial, untrusting, and possibly mentally imbalanced, she is also at the center of an extremely classified government conspiracy...    The Millennium trilogy is a masterful, captivating tale of intrigue and deceit. The plot between the three volumes is seamless and flows effortlessly. The characters are engaging and feel real.    The first book in the trilogy, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, introduces us to one of the most memorable heroines in modern literature; Lizbeth Salander.  In my opinion, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is the slowest moving of the three books; it took me a few chapters to become invested in the story. In the first chapters we are introduced to a number of characters and it takes awhile for them to all be tied together in the plot. However, by the second half of the book I was hooked! The ending of the book left me satisfied yet yearning for more. The first book really could stand alone, I wanted to know what would happen to Lizbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist, but there were no loose end to tie up. I give this book a 3.5 out of 5 stars, I enjoyed it but was bored with it at times.    The second book, The Girl who Played with Fire, started out explosively and never slowed down. The book was packed with action throughout its entirety! A journalist working for Millennium (Mikael Blomkvist's magazine) is murdered, along with his girlfriend, while working on a book about the illegal sex trade in Sweden. The murders are shocking enough, but even more shocking is that Lizbeth Salander is the sole suspect! Salander is on the run while Blomkvist is working to clear her name and find out who actually committed the murders, and why. I give this book a 4.5 out of 5 stars, it wasn't perfect but very close.    The Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest is the conclusion to the Millennium Trilogy. It is also fast paced and riveting. Lizbeth Salander has been near-fatally shot and is recovering in a Swedish hospital. She is kept in isolation and is awaiting trial on numerous charges. Mikael Blomkvist is hard at work, once again, trying to uncover the secrets regarding Salander's past. The revelations he uncovers leads him down a dangerous path which involves uncovering the truth behind Sweden's most highly classified government organization; an organization that has apparently gone `rouge' and is unknown even to the prime minister. The evidence that could clear Salander's name lies somewhere within the depths of this organization... I give this book 5 out of 5 stars! It was absolutely addicting and it is definitely a book that I will continue to think about for some time to come.    For more book reviews please visit my blog at [...].

0375842209|5.0|This was an excellent book. Leisel is 9 years-old and has already suffered a tragic life when she arrives at the doorstep to the home of her foster parents. The book is narrated by Death who seems to take an interest in Leisel. Death's narration is to the point, sad but comical at times. The book gives a lot of insight into the lives the poorer Germans during the war, but also how they fought for the smallest bit of good and beauty in things to keep them going. Small acts of kindness towards the condemned would earn any German serious consequences. By harboring a Jew in their basement for a couple years, they were putting their lives on the line. But a strong relationship grows between the fugitive and the family. The effect he has on Leisel will change her forever. There were many different and eccentric characters throughout the novel and, though a lot of them did not get along, they always came together in times of need.<br /><br />Many found this book sad in the end but I didn't. It was a very good story, and sure, many tragic things happened throughout and towards the end but there was also hope and feelings of happiness. Not an upbeat book but definitely a must-read!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was an excellent ending to a great series.  This book truly challenges our thinking not only about war but right and wrong on a very basic level.  If you are looking for a fairytale ending you will be partly satisfied.  This is not meant to be a happy ending type of but what do you expect from a story about war?  Keep a realistic viewpoint and you will enjoy it.  Can't wait to see the film!
B001TJYFSE|5.0|I like the book, it provides lot of information and is honest about its own limitations. Lot more research will be needed to understand nutrition but this seems like a good summary.
1439102724|4.0|I like the mix of music therapy with Jodi Picoult's latest tome, involving the drama of a couple unable to conceive even with IVF, divorce, then a lesbian marriage, and a Christian protest against using embryos from a former marriage. Wow, quite a mix of current themes - can they be healed with music therapy? It's a unique idea to include a music CD (the music is lovely) and, as someone who believes in music therapy, it helped me get through some of the parts of the book that made me angry (some fundamental Christians' condemnation of other people's lifestyles and choices). It's akin to my adding chakra meditations before each chapter of my book, in which each character grapples with inner demons connected to one of the seven chakras... they help keep you balanced while you get drawn into and led out of some dark, deep places. All in all, not my favorite topics in Jodi's latest book but, as usual, she did a good job in keeping my interest and the pages turning until I was done.<br />Becca Chopra, author of The Chakra Diaries
0307474712|4.0|This book was really good. I thought it started out a little slow and didn't really get into it until about a quarter of the way through. Then it just took off and I didn't want to put it down. I just wanted to find out what happened next. Dexter's character seemed to be a little unbelievable at times but it ends up all coming together. The ending is very, very surprising. It was one of those books you don't want to end.
B0040JHWKS|5.0|It has been a long time coming to be able to listen to some of Bruce's old songs.  The Darkness of the Edge of Town and Nebraska are my two favorite CD's of his.  I have all his music and have not missed a concert in Toronto, since the River in 79, the only CD and concert I do not have or did not attend was Born in the USA Tour.  If you are a true Bruce fan, that is the timeframe for Bruce to miss.. Just my two cents.  The Promise does not disappoint!      One happy Bruce fan!    Lisa
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I fell in love with this book almost immediately and couldn't put it down.  Every spare moment I had, I was reading a tidbit on my phone, even if it was only for two minutes.  However, the last 1/4 of the book the quality seemed to drop off quite a bit.  I don't want to give anything away for those that haven't read it... but the methods that the author uses to resolve the plot just wasn't up to what I expected from the rest of the book.    Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the book and I'm going to read the rest of them, but with how strong it started out of the gate, I just expected it to carry through the entire book.
B000O179EA|1.0|I bought this movie on HD DVD because I am one of the few people with an HD DVD player.  You can get them really cheap so I figured, why not?  It had pretty good reviews - it was worth 4 or 5 bucks.  Boy was I wrong!  This movie was absolutely stupid beyond belief.  The special effects were weak and the ghosts were obnoxiously over the top characters.  The love connection was also totaly unbelievable.  stay away from this movie - don't waste your four bucks on it.  Go enjoy a newspaper and a latte instead.  You will be happier in the end.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|If you have a love of horses, then this is a movie you must watch.  When the lady (Diane Lane) realizes the potential the horse has and what a joy he is being around.  You just come to understnad the mutual love and understanding that has grown between them.    THe supporting cast plays a important role as well from the trainer, the jockey, and his keeper who knew him best. This is a story of love, faith, and goals that the whole family will be drawn into and cheer for \\"Secretariat\\" the greatest race horse of all time.    Enjoys folks!!!  You will not be dissapointed.
B0000DCGT0|5.0|Loved the vcr version.  We're very glad that the DVD version is out.  Thanks for a timely delivery and perfect condition.
B003UESJF6|4.0|I have to admit it; I think I let my expectations for this one get a little out of control.  As out of control as Megamind's ambitions of world domination? Well maybe not quite that bad, but still, despite plans of doing my best to maintain a level head going in, I was pretty swept up in the hype surrounding this big budget computer animated feature.  So did it live up to such stratospheric expectations you ask?  Surprisingly, yes it did and I think a lot of it had to do with the fact that the film does a fantastic job of referencing the little nuances that comic book heroes (or most pertinently, villains) have to endure to keep the hero, well, heroic.<br /><br />Kinda like another tale we're all familiar with, this film opens with a world in eminent danger of being sucked into a black hole and some loving parents placing their infant child into an escape pod.  With his pet/ protector (a fish named Minion), young Megamind (Will Ferrell) finds himself hurdling toward a small blue planet at the edge of the Milky Way only his exodus isn't the only one taking place.<br /><br />Apparently another planet, one with very human-like inhabitants, had very similar ambitions for the survival of their species and sent a pod of their own.<br /><br />In true born loser fashion, this second pod enjoys a smooth trip to Earth and lands on the property of a rich loving couple while Megamind's route traverses endless asteroid belts before finally landing within the gated walls of a prison.  With very different upbringings, a rivalry is born between the two alien refugees only unlike the do-gooding Metro Man (Brad Pitt), Megamind has no real powers save for a massive brain.  Since Metro Man has the \\"city's good guy\\" role pretty well filled, Megamind has little choice but to take up villainy.<br /><br />Despite a pretty good heart, Megamind finds himself repeating tried and true schemes like kidnapping news reporter, Roxanne Ritchi (Tina Fey) only to end up in a custom-painted cellblock in Metro City's prison.<br /><br />Things take an incredible twist when the villain actually gets the upper hand and the reality of the hero/villain symbiotic relationship is finally made clear to Megamind.<br /><br />There's a few central questions behind Megamind, that actually serve as the catalyst for the entire prose, many of which fans of comic books will really take to heart.  Sure on the surface what we're looking at is essentially a spoof at the Superman/ Lex Luthor relationship (with a little Lois Lane thrown in for good measure) only unlike the famous DC tale, DreamWorks slaps a few welcomed twisted to the equation.  Not the least of these is what if the bad guy didn't want to be evil so much as it was forced upon him from the onset.  Another really explores the idea that the relationship between the hero and the villain is one that demands the presence of the other to work.<br /><br />The latter has been explored in films like 1999's Mystery Men but the point is really driven home here in MegaMind.<br /><br />The comedy feels a little bit strained at times but the cast here just plays so well off one another that laughter's inevitable regardless of the viewer's mood going in.  Will Farrell dazzles with his trademark blend of casual dryness and additional props are due to David Cross as Minion and Jonah Hill as Titan.<br /><br />Pacing is quit spot on, and actually succeeds over Pixar's superhero attempt \\"The Incredibles\\"- which did bog down in spots.  Megamind is consistently lively, enthusiastic and visually rich.<br /><br />Hans Zimmer is responsible for the scoring here and does his usual charming work even if the softer tones are often lost to the wailing guitars of Guns n Roses and AC/DC (even the late Michael Jackson isn't overlooked on this explosively charged soundtrack).<br /><br />About the biggest complaint I've located surrounding this film is that the whole genre has been covered by Pixar's Incredibles and Universal's Despicable Me and thisis a valid concern, although a legitimate argument can be made that compared directly against Pixar's 2004 entry, these latter two pieces serve as reminders to the ever-advancing computer generated film industry.  From a visual standpoint, the small details are just outstanding.  Perfection of facial systems, textures and lighting simulations are evident in nearly every frame here.<br /><br />In all I have to confess that DreamWorks' collective grasp on the medium of computer generated feature filmmaking is subtly becoming masterful, if undeniably commercial.  While biggest rival Pixar is often limited by what can be accomplished within the confines of a G rating, DW seems increasingly proficient at packing as much into their PG pictures as possible.  There is no confusing the fact that this is an adult-oriented comedy that children will enjoy too (not the other way around).<br /><br />Considering the past two DreamWorks releases were How to Train Your Dragon and MegaMind, it's clear that Disney/ Pixar has their proverbial hands full.  Megamind may not be quite as butter-smooth, adventurous, or as grand-scoped as How to Train Your Dragon but it does harken back to the type of pacing and comedic brilliance viewers have come to expect from films like Kung-Fu Panda.  Megamind offers a whole lot of fun, some solid visuals, and an interesting spin on the \\"Man of Steel\\" legacy.against Pixar's 2004 entry, these latter two pieces serve as reminders to the ever-advancing computer generated film industry.

B0036TGSR6|5.0|at how enthralling this movie is---it captivated me from start to finish---which surprises me because I had no interest seeing this when it first came out. I only watched it because there was nothing else on cable----it's just excellent on all counts.
B004BBDHEK|5.0|Being a Yanni fan for many years, I enjoyed most of his works but was willing to hear something more instrumental after the voices albums.  Both Voices versions (English & Spanish) are very good, but, I just wanted to listen to more new music from this talented artist.  At first, Truth Of Touch caught me off guard as I was expecting probably a more traditional sound.  This is totally new and it feels very refreshing.  Yes, I agree there are more electronic sounds but they are all wonderful.  Nathan, Chloe and Leslie each sing a wonderful song.  So, it is pretty well balanced.    I am not dissapointed by Yanni's return.  You will enjoy Truth Of Touch new melodies and modern style.  Yanni keeps up surprising his fans positively.    I totally recommend this new album and hope there is a DVD show version coming out soon as well.  I'll be among the first to buy it.
0815411839|4.0|..I enjoy reading this every evening before I go to bed.  I've read so many books on her, but this one seems to be one of the best by far.  Spoto did some great research with dates, places, details, and descriptions.  It's very eye opening.  I'll keep reading and update later...    I finally finished reading this book last night.  My overall feeling?  The best book on Monroe so far.  And I only say 'so far' because I haven't read them all.  It's with great honor that Spoto does not sensationalize anything about her or her life.  Was her life at times bumpy?  No doubt, but I respect that Spoto squashes the Kennedy rumors (among many other crazy accusations over the years) by backing up each encounter with facts from all of the research he did.      You will finally get a clear picture of all the layers of her personality.  Marilyn was much smarter - some might say brilliant - than people gave her credit for, but her downfall was the emotional stress that plaque her and the vultures that pretended to be her friends when all they wanted was a piece of her.    She was the most beautiful flawed diamond.  If you are a Monroe fan, read this book.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|This book shows the dedication a mother has for her child in a horrible situation. It seems like the author got the idea from that poor girl from California that was kidnapped and had 2 girls with her kidnapper.
1932100660|5.0|It's a totally awesome book. It has been also so mind-blowing to me to learn that we've been fed a \\"scam\\" in forms of RDA's etc, who is behind them and whose interests they reflect and so on, but also it has been life-changing for us , my husband has a cardiovascular disease and recently he had 6 months mid- appointment, and when he initially had angiography, he had signed approval for stents, however now after 6 months of following the food plan described in the book combined with prescribed medication, his doctor talks about probability of restoration in about 3-5 years, and his medication was been halved! His current blood cholesterol is 86- down from around 150 initially...    Also, this book adresses effects of diet on cancer, MS, and it is not a \\"fad\\" but a solid and conservative research... Awesome! Thank you, Mr. Campbell- it's a life-saver for us!!!
B000000OUW|2.0|Its not only their worst album its an album that i don't like any song. I am a Manowar fan and i like very much all their albums (except Fighting the world which is just ok). Guys don't waste your time in this album , its just for Manowar Collectors. If you are new check The triumph of steel and Kings of metal.
B0041KKYCY|5.0|This movie is downright gritty and the perps get EVERYTHING they deserve-right down to the crows peckin out dude's eyeballs! Very graphic and well-played by all actors. If you like this kind of stuff, you'll love this remake!!
B004GP3DTK|2.0|Lean Into it was what the people cared for when it came to Mr Big. That's what people still care for when it comes to Mr Big. (My personal favorite is their rocking debut, that I know won't be followed up in this universe). The band went grunge, like the other hard rock acts, with \\"Hey Man\\" and disappeared from the scene. Why make another Stone Temple Pilots album in 2011, when people are ready to rock again? Doesn't make sense. Brighten up guys, and give us pure Mr Big bliss in the next Mr Big album!

B000066JES|4.0|After their disspointing album Louder then Hell Manowar come with this great one. It has good songs and one of their best songs ever - Warriors of the world united (You must listen this songs immediately if not sooner). I have to say that in my first listening s to this cd i didn't like it much but after some listening s i get in the zone and i believe its a very good album , so give it a try. Its a must for Manowar fans and all metal fans should listen Warriors of the World United.
B002Q8Z8KG|1.0|I had free $5 credit so I thought I would try this out. I opted for the $1.99 standard version instead of $2.99 HD. It was a mistake. I thought the standard quality was going to be like Hulu. It was not. I would definitely recommend the HD version even if it costs more. If you put the regular version on full screen on the computer, it is completely distorted.
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|Angelina is simply stunning, and Johnny is well, what can I say.....he's gorgeous.  The movie was good, light-hearted, and a nice change of pace from other movies out there.  The French and Italian scenery is so beautiful that it makes me want to visit Europe.  The movie has a nice flow and is a bit unpredictable (for a change) with a nice twist at the end.  It's worth the money.
B002ZG997C|5.0|This movie was great. It shows how we should all be grateful that we have the right to read the Bible without persecution. I for one think that is of high importance and this movie demonstrates it.
B003UESJFG|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this movie. Its lovely, touching, hilarious. The use of 80's hair metal and rock music blew my mind and made it all the more enjoyable.<br /><br />My children both loved \\"The Button of Doom\\" and we watched the extras a few times, like meet the cast and such.<br /><br />Buy this, you will watch it again and again and love it more each time.
B0041KKYCY|5.0|This is an outstanding vengeance movie. Aside from the abrupt ending after dealing with the last scumbag the movie was awesome. If you like vengeance movies you will love this one! As well as The Horseman.
B004IDYK0G|4.0|I never would have thought to buy The Script's album if Amazon hadn't recommended it. However, I'm glad I did. This is an amazing album. I won't even bother to list my favorite songs because they're all great and complement each other. These days when all you need to have a hit song is a hot beat, its refreshing to stick The Script CD in my player and hear meaningful songs with deep lyrics that I can relate to. I'm definitely a fan.
B003UESJF6|5.0|This is a five star movie which does not include any adult scences yet includes many themes that a child might not have a grasp of yet. Like how when you have everything it may seem like you have nothing. Like insecurity in a marraige and jealously. It is even a bit complex and has interesting twists and turns. Bottom line is two adults and two kids went to see this at the movies. At the end the adults say this was a 5 star movie and the kids said it was like a 3-4 star movie.
0670022411|3.0|Owning a Kindle, I found that the story started to provided some action at the 60% mark.  The beginning of the book was a cliche of whining, stubborn witch and a brooding \\"Angel-like\\" vampire.  The stubborness of the witch Diana was beyond absurd, taking \\"I can take care of myself\\" againts witches, vampires and daemons to a new urealistic level.  I almost gave up at halfway through the book.  Too many secrets from the reader can ruin a book.  There was redemption at the end with a little action.  But ending was incomplete leaving legions of questions.  Buy Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  At least there is action going on.

0525421580|4.0|by Sydnee Thompson<br /><br />When I sat down to read Will Grayson, Will Grayson by John Green and David Levithan, I had no idea what the book was about. All I knew was that for whatever reason, a lot of people seemed to like it, and now I know why. Will Grayson, Will Grayson is at once smart, witty, and emotional, with probably the best voice that I've read in a long time. I got ahold of this book by way of my local public library, but I'm tempted to buy it or, remarkably, take the time to write down some of its zingers so I can continue to laugh at them for months to come. Seriously, how can you read `My search party is creeping into your no man's land,' and not at least crack a smile? It cannot be done.<br /><br />This novel is the story of two teenage boys living in suburban Chicago who share the same first and last name. Due to a stunning coincidence one rainy night, the two of them bump into each other at an adult sex shop (no, I'm not kidding) and strike up an honest conversation on the sidewalk outside that leads to something bigger than either of them can comprehend.<br /><br />One thing I love about this book in particular is its inclusion of the LGBT community. Will Grayson's best friend (honestly I have no clue how to differentiate in a review which Will I'm talking about, so I'll just call this particular Grayson Will #1), Tiny Cooper, is about as big and fabulously gay as they come, and often drags Will #1 along for his Gay Straight Alliance meetings. Will #2 just happens to be gay as well (though not nearly as fabulous about it). The focus on homosexuality in this book is significant, but not overtly so. Never did I get the feeling that Green or Levithan was trying to be overly politically correct or offensive - the tone surrounding it was very easygoing. Yes, Tiny Cooper is very gay, but the writing makes him and other homosexuals out as `guys that happen to be gay' instead of `those flighty fairies.' This is the first YA book I've read where LGBT teens take center stage, so that's nice to see.<br /><br />If I had finished this review immediately upon finishing the book, the star rating would have been a bit higher. A few weeks later, some of the plot points and characterizations in the novel seem...for lack of a better word, schmultzy. For example, Tiny's play. What person is so full of himself to write a play entirely about his own love life? What's more, who is so full of himself to write a play entirely about his own love life...and then present it to the school board as something everyone would want to see? I mean seriously, Tiny names one of his characters Gill Wrayson. I get that in the end it's supposed to be about love and tolerance and all that, but if I saw that poster in my high school hallway, I'd be just as incredulous as I am now. The narration began to lose me in the second half, as well - I felt Green and Levithan were trying to sneak in way more introspection and philosophical musings than would be normal for a group of teenagers. Still, you gotta love when guys share man hugs and cry.o that's nice to see.    If I had finished this review immediately upon finishing the book, the star rating would have been a bit higher.

8186336141|5.0|This private label book was first published in 1966, well before the current yoga renaissance. Given the high level of interest in yoga therapy, it is astounding how far-sighted and prescient this book has been.    If we had to recommend just one book on yoga, this would be it. The title is a concise and precise summation of its contents. The book is comprehensive, free of ideology, and clinical in its writing. Even though it covers what seem like all yoga asanas, pranayamas, mudras, and bandhas, it is not overwhelming. This is because it is systematically organized into beginner, intermediate, and advanced groups of asanas, with step-by-step instructions as well as benefits and limitations or contraindications. Pranayama, bandha, and mudra follow the same level of detail as do the cleansing shat karma kriyas and a general introduction to chakras.    What makes this book particularly special is its enormously useful therapeutic index. For decades, this was the one book that listed not just the benefits, but also the contraindications of each asana. With increasing numbers of yoga injuries, and yoga-related ER visits, this information is something all yoga teachers as well as students should find helpful. Even after 40 years, the book remains unmatched.
0061801313|1.0|Please read the first few chapters before giving this book to your middle school girl.  The characters (juniors in highschool)  drink alcohol, smoke pot, pick up men (a teacher) in a bar, take their clothes off for boys, steal and do many other things you may not want your child to think is acceptable behavior.  If you want to have a frank talk about sex, alcohol, drugs, sexual identity, stealing and eating disorders you may find the book a good starting point.
B002ZG976U|5.0|the singing was spectacular, the costumes were over the top gorgeous, and the dancing well done!  the story line wasn't deep but cute and good enough to help hold the movie together. all the lines were well delivered and the interaction between everyone, outstanding. the connection between christina, cher and stanley were especially charismatic and amusing in all the right places.  it was also teasingly sexy without being raunchy (which i'm sure the christina hating media would have pounced on if it had been)!    the bad flack from the media is not so much about the movie, as is the fact that it's a project featuring christina. for some time i've been aware of their strong dislike for her and their constant bullying and humiliating of her every chance they get.    i enjoyed every minute of this movie and purchased the soundtrack and the dvd!
0756404738|4.0|(Minor Spoilers Below)    I can't remember the last time I looked forward to reading a book as much this one.  The long layoff helped build the anticipation of course, but I was glad to put it off by an additional day or two in order to re-read Name of the Wind, one of my favorite books of the last several years.  In doing so I was reminded that the story of Kvothe is not one of constant action and drama, and the plot does not move along at anything resembling a quick pace.  This is certainly true of the second book.    One of my favorite parts of Name of the Wind was Kvothe's University adventures.  Yet as Wise Man's Fear rejoins our hero at school and stays there for some time, I quickly found myself hoping for something new.  Shenanigans on campus, duels with Ambrose and Kvothe's repeated inability to resolve his Denna issues finally began to grow a bit stale.  While in the first book I wasn't all that excited by the Draccus adventure, I was definitely ready for Kvothe to take a field trip this time.  And thankfully, he does.    To me, the story picked up its pace quite a bit after Kvothe hit the road, with a notable exception.  His cross-over into the faerie world was the only section of the book that I found truly tedious.  Otherwise, partially ingratiating himself with high society, tackling bandits with a band of mercenaries and learning combat skills (among other things) with the Adem worked fine for me.  As another reviewer pointed out, we ultimately end up back where we started... so what did the whole thing accomplish?  With its pacing and copious amount of minor detail, this book feels more like another block in the foundation of an epic biography (so presumably it's accomplishing the writer's goal).  But suddenly, the trilogy I expected doesn't seem to be enough for this story. I came away feeling that *if* Rothfuss spends this much time devoted to the rest of Kvothe's growth and his implied fall from grace, then Book 2 fits perfectly.  If, on the otherhand, everything gets wrapped up tidily and rather quickly in Book 3, then I may look back on The Wise Man's Fear as a somewhat slow and bloated interlude in Kvothe's tale.    The writing is exceptional and in many ways the story continues to find ways to be engrossing without resorting to a lot of action.  Which is what sets Rothfuss' work apart from so many other novels out there.

159420229X|5.0|Whether you have memory problems (can't recall the name of someone you met a week ago?) or not, you're likely to improve your memory after reading this book. Even if you don't - but odds are you will - it makes for fascinating reading.<br /><br />It definitely was a major aid for me and I do think of it as a unique \\"self help\\" book, one that can have immediate results, helping to make life easier, alleviate tricky memory issues and more. I think it is important to disclose that I'm a Baby Boomer and my memory seems to have worsened with age. I used to recall the name of nearly everyone I met as well as both major and minor actors and actresses, all of my teachers (from kindergarten through high school) as well as the first and last names of every one of my high school classmates. I could recall even tiny details of books read long ago.<br /><br />But Moonwalking with Einstein goes far beyond remembering the names of acqaintances. It can help make your daily life easier, aiding you when you try to find lost items - or keep them from getting lost in the first place- and actually train you to find ways to improve your memory.<br /><br />For added fun, the author includes examples of people who have amazing abilities to recall things. I wondered if at least one of them could give Vegas a run for its money or even be banned from casinos. Although I don't plan to test my abilities in Vegas, I have been practicing in casual card games, with gratifying results. The surprised looks from friends and family members was worth the cost of the book.<br /><br />I'd strongly recommend you give this one a try. The techniques can even be fun for a whole family to share - and test -together. And c'mon...how can you pass up a book which explores \\"the art and science of remembering everything\\"?
B00004W221|5.0|This movie is one of the best sports movies of all time! I do not like Notre Dame football, but this movie is a testimony to never quitting on anything in life! My wife even loves this movie.  I have watched this movie multiple times and still get choked up during certain scenes.  I wish more of today's youth had Rudy's determination, will power, and drive to work very hard for his dreams/goals.  An outstanding movie that should be shared generation after generation.  This movie \\"technically\\" isn't about football, its about overcoming obstacles in life and charging forward!  Highly recommend this movie!

B001XJEKGC|5.0|Wow, I was blown away to see this duo in action sharing the stage!  It is a great performance, whether you were a Blind Faith fan or even if you've never heard of Blind Faith...this concert will rock your socks off!  The music just gets better with each song with Clapton and Winwood performing at their prime, it's like they bring each other to another level just by being on the same stage together again.  Just when you think it can't get any better, the next song tops the last.  Just as a concert should, when it ends it leaves you wanting more.  Thanks to these guys for getting together and making this amazing concert for us all to enjoy.  For anyone who loves music, this is a must have DVD!

B0000028RR|2.0|Although this is a highly touted album, it is fairly weak. Rage Against The Machine is one of the most admired bands of the rap-metal movement of the 90's, and that's fair enough, they are one of the best bands in the genre; hey! at least every song isn't some teen whining about all their angst and pain, and how they're so tough. However, for a band with a message, lead singer Zack de la Rocha raps as fast as he can, and it is often difficult to understand what he is saying, without refering to the lyrics sheet. That said, he is also often a good rapper.    And with regards to the music, their song-writing is formulaic, predictable and often lazy. There are so many filler moments where the music in the background just plays a bass line on repeat and Zack raps on and on. Almost all songs follow the same pattern; intro (the chorus backing music)/ quiet verse / heavy chorus /quiet verse / heavy chorus /instrumental / heavy chorus / some screaming (e.g. on the song Wake Up). Their songwriting is not very deep, the riffs can cross the line between catchy and repetitive. Repeat plays wear this album thin fairly quickly.     But their music is quite energetic, the guitarist Tom Morello has some very excellent work, he is very creative, especially with intriguing high-pitched effects. And these guys have some seriously rocking riffing. Like funk-rock that just explodes from your speakers or earphones, just like a bomb going off. And, take you hat off to Zack, he puts a lot of energy in his vocals.     Unfortunately, this album is too laborious to deserve a good rating. But at least they have a lot of talent and promise. Rating **
0802714544|5.0|An absolutely terrific novel. Amazingly well written. That the author could write such a complex and entertaining story in just over 200 pages is a tribute to his great talent. There are virtually no wasted words and the story unfolds quickly and dramatically. The pace is lightning fast, the plot is very clever, and the ending is dramatic. I highly recommend this book.
B000JQU1VS|4.0|I've always liked Sherlock Holmes stories and this is a very good collection of them.  They were easy to read and entertaining as always.  My only issue with this title is that when they converted it to an eBook some of the letters used in the french phrases in the books were not converted correctly and show up as a set of symbols instead.  This did not really detract from the stories but made it difficult at times to interpret what was trying to be said.
B003EYVXUU|5.0|I thought the original Swedish movie \\"Let the Right One In\\" was so great, why re-do it? But this is a terrific version. Creepy, scary, suspenseful, yet also touching. Three of us went to see it and afterward all three of us were calling friends to tell them to see it. Now THAT's a sign of a good movie.
B000JQU4TW|3.0|This is my first time reading this book and I found that it was difficult to get in to the story.  The book was overly descriptive in some instances that lead to me envisioning the story exactly as the author had seen it instead of leaving a lot of it up to my imagination.  This is not a problem when reading a non-fiction book but when it comes to fiction, I feel it is a hindrance to my ability to enjoy the book.  I would recommend this book to those who have nothing else they would like to read at this time, otherwise, watch the movie version of this.
0307001369|4.0|This children's book by Richard Scary is another one of his very cleverly illustrated books- a Golden Book , in fact which is also easy for a young child to hold.  Ages 2 to 5 would probably enjoy looking at the pictures with cute looking animals here and there. There are many detail that the older child can learn to erad and perhaps spell.
0793542049|4.0|I purchased this book based on the strength of the reviews. I was looking for a book to help learn how to play the bass, and to strengthen my understanding of what notes are where on the neck of the bass.<br /><br />The book stands as an excellent resource for learning how to construct bass lines over chord changes found in Jazz and similar styles. It begins simple, teaching you about finding and playing the root of the chord, and the fifth and octave. As you advance through the book, you begin to learn variations on these - different methods of approaching the root and fifth, as well as scales and arpeggios. Some sections explicitly lay out the notes to play, and more advanced sections simply give you the chord changes so that you can apply what you've learned in the prior lesson.<br /><br />Friedland also uses the book as a sort of crash course in music theory. In this, I believe the book suffers some. There is a lone page dedication to chord building, showing most of the variations of a C chord (major, minor, diminished, augmented, and the 7th variations of those). This is the only place where the chords are explicitly spelled out, if you aren't familiar enough with the notes in a given key to build a chord on your own, you might have a rough time of it. If you have a list of the key signatures in front of you, this weakness can be nullified or worked around. Obviously, if you have enough musical background to build the chords on your own, this isn't an issue at all. One of the negative reviewers comments that all of the examples are in C - if he only meant the \\"Basics of Chord Construction\\" section, then it's true, otherwise Friedland meanders across a wide variety of chords and keys.<br /><br />If you are looking for a book with tablature, don't look here. Some might find this a weakness, but I believe it to be a strength. In order to really understand how to construct your own bass lines, and to give yourself the freedom to move around the neck, being able toread music and understand the chords beyond simple numbers on a line is essential. I don't mind tabs, but I prefer to read the more descriptive standard notation as much as possible.<br /><br />All in all, a strong book, especially if you can construct chord spellings (or are capable of finding how yourself).

B003L20ID8|4.0|Based on a  Philip K. Dick short story, The Adjustment Bureau has romance and action going for it, with a touch of comedy and philosophy, too. It's science fiction, but unlike the futuristic Blade Runner, Total Recall, and Minority Report (also films based on Dick's works), it's set in the present.<br /><br />Basically, the film poses this question: Can free will, determination, and love triumph over determinism? Matt Damon is a young politician on the rise, who is programmed to do well with the public, with everything he does selected by consultants, who run things by focus groups--right down to which tie he wears. Emily Blunt (who plays a dancer) is there to inspire him to make a great concession speech, and then is supposed to vanish from his life, but the Adjustment Bureau (charged with making sure the right events occur, with the right people in power) screws up, and they fall in love.<br /><br />Damon and Blunt are terrific as the romantic leads, and Terence Stamp, Anthony Mackie, and John Slattery (all of whom must wear fedoras, which allow them to get through special doors to do their adjustment work quickly in New York City, in which the film takes place) are good in supporting roles.<br /><br />This is an entertaining and moving film, which somehow imparts enjoyment without the usual explosions and long car chases, although there are a couple of scenes which drag on a bit. All in all, I recommend this film for its romance, action sequences, good acting, and decent direction.
B002JODUI4|5.0|Although more down-to-earth and low-toned than the dancy 4x4=12, this album is thoroughly enjoyable. From the instant-hit \\"Ghosts n Stuff\\" to the trance-inducing \\"Strobe,\\" this album will keep you occupied through many replays.

B004E547D8|5.0|Started out a little slow but the mix of characters that were introduced along the way were well worth it.  Little suspense, little drama, action, and throw in a hint of comedy, what more could you ask for.  Glad we bought it.  It's definitely a watch-again movie.
0670022411|5.0|I feared that this book would be an adult version of \\"Twilight,\\" but i was happy to discover that i was wrong.  Although this book did have a love story and plenty of vampires (as well as witches), Deborah Harkness's background as a scholar in the history of magic brought depth to the plot and to the main character, Diana.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that the plot slows a bit after Diana and Matthew left Oxford, but I never felt that the plot dragged.  My only disappointment was that I did not realize when I began the book that the story would not be over at the end of the book.  I found myself thinking back to the book after I was done and wondering how quickly the next book would be out!
B0031RSA24|2.0|Ok, when you read a book and when the first two chapters use \\"because this guy said '...'\\" as a scientific basis for truth then you know you are just reading a 'religious' book, albeit an atheist. I was expecting a book based on scientific fact, theory, and hypothesis, but found it more akin to a Creationist trying to prove creation based on what the preacher said. I expect someone who claims science to use science in his claims to prove his point. If you are looking for a discussion on what a long chain of people have stated and believe then it might be an interesting read but if you are looking for an Atheist to proof his world view with science then you'll be disappointed. I gave it two stars because he does have a lot of quotes form several people but not a three star rating because the personal views of the people he quotes does not suffice for sound scientific fact. Just remember a conclusion with one or more theories to generate an idea can only be a theory, not fact, but the author uses 'world view/theology' (personal belief/statements of people including atheists) and perceives it as 'fact.' ...(in modern words: Epic Fail!)

0689865384|4.0|This is one of the best future written novels I have ever read. I love the way Scott Westerfeld made a really well rounded future world. I was awed by the fact that he was able to construct such a huge society with just his imagination and I respect him greatly for that. As for the book and storyline itself, I thought it was all very good. I was little bored and disappointed at some points but I was mostly excited and shocked by the twists and turns Scott Westerfeld added to these books. I suggest you read these books if you're ready for some changes in the way you see the world today.
0099413140|5.0|I bought this for my grandchild(5). Her mother reports(rather wearily) that it HAS to be read every night! Needless to say it has been a big hit. The fact that the Queen selects a particular pair of knickers for a particular event really seems to appeal to girls. Their Mums may not be too thrilled if they try to emulate the Queen! A fun book. A simple idea which introduces a fairly wide vocabulary of \\"British\\" lingo.

Other then those things it was, like i've said, good

B004EQAVHI|5.0|This movie keeps you on edge thinking that the characters are going to finally figure things out and escape. Whats so cool about this movie it makes people come up with their own ideas and discussions. Reminds me of the other story \\"Coma\\". Another thing is that you are waiting for somebody to have some kind of compassion and help these kids. Their brainwashed to believe that their purpose in life is to donate parts to save others. My feeling is that I need to get a swat team together and take out those teachers and doctors and save the kids. I know becoming an organ donor is a great, but it does make you think twice watching these movies and reading the books. lol

B003KNDMXG|5.0|Janelle Monae is who one could say is in a class by herself. Ever since she made her debut in 2005 on OutKast member Big Boi's \\"Got Purp? Volume 1\\", she has piqued the interest of many people. Unfortunately, Big Boi's label, Purple Ribbon Entertainment, never got the chance to show her talent due to it's distributor Virgin Records falling victim to a corporate merger. In early 2008, she found an ally in a very unlikely partner- Bad Boy Entertainment CEO Sean \\"P. Diddy\\" Combs. She signed with the label to release her critically acclaimed EP, \\"Metropolis: The Chase Suite\\". It was intended to be the first of three EP's to revolve around the concept of an android gone AWOL named Cyndi Mayweather. She decided at the last minute to consolidate the other two EP's into a full length effort called \\"The ArchAndroid\\", produced  mostly by \\"Metropolis\\" producers Nate Wonder and Chuck Lightning of Wondaland Arts Society. The end result is a listening experience that is equally enjoyable as it is unpredictable.<br /><br />It's really difficult to describe what genre she fits in, being that she covers them all and leaves no stone unturned. She does hip hop on the Saul Williams featured \\"Dance Or Die\\", as well as 60's Motown soul on \\"Faster\\", \\"Cold War\\" and the Big Boi assisted \\"Tightrope\\". She channels the 50's orchestrated pop on \\"Sir Greendown\\" and \\"57821\\", while venturing into psychedelic rock on \\"Mushrooms & Roses\\". On \\"Come Alive (War Of The Roses)\\", she gives off a musical vibe that is reminiscent of the early 80's band Violent Femmes. She duets with indie rock band Of Montreal on the synth heavy \\"Make The Bus\\" and closes the album with the eight minute orchestra driven ballad \\"BabopbyeYa\\". \\"The ArchAndroid\\" is a fantastic record from Janelle Monae, but it's very ambitious for a debut. In order to truly get into this recording, one has to be a fan of many genres to fully understand it. She takes you on a musical journey through time and space, and is fearless in that regard. If you re looking for something new, fresh and different than what's out today, look no further than \\"The ArchAndroid\\".re looking for something new, fresh and different than what's out today, look no further than \\"The ArchAndroid\\".

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I hadnt seen this movie yet and I watched an interview with Wendell Potter; the author of Deadly Spin.  He apologized to Michael Moore for killing this movie and discrediting him.  Wendell Potter was a PR executive with Cigna Insurance and prior with Humana. He had enough, he had to speak out. In doing so, he explained how an insurance person had seen Sicko at the Cannes Film Festival and it received a standing ovation.  The insurance industry person got together with all of the others and sald this movie would mobilize the American public against the purely for profit insurance industry and that they had to find a way to discredit Michael Moore as just a left wing lunatic.  Well, unfortunately they successded and this movie wasn't taken as serious as it should.<br /><br />Because of this, I decided to purchase Sicko.  What a fabulous movie.  It wasn't as political as I expected, it showed how other oountries deal with healthcare. It shows how civilized countries treat their people.  Are there a few more taxes, yes (maybe, I checked and some countries are about the same as us)<br /><br />The most amazing thing to me was the \\"spin\\" that came out about the Cuba scene was that he was praising Castro or something.  It was far from that. He was taking 911 volunteers who cannot receive proper healthcare to find a place where we give the best healthcare -Guantanimo Bay detainees.  When they wouldn't let him in, he docked his boat in Havana and these heros of 911 were given medical treatment and medication.  It was just amazing.  The Cuban opinion is that you need a healthy country to thrive.<br /><br />I'm not advocating Cuba, it was just a very enlightening scene.<br /><br />The other was the man here who had to make a choice as to which finger he wanted sewn back on from an accident because he couldn't afford both. He had to only choose one. How sad, we THREW HIS FINGER AWAY,when a doctor could easily attach it but he didn't have the $60,000 to do so.  In Europe, the same situation happened to an individual and his hand is fully functional with ALL fingers reattached.<br /><br />I find this to be absolutely third world.  We are the USA and we have worst treatment of our people than ANY civilized country.<br /><br />Let's think of this realistically, if my company and I didn't have to pay for our healthcare insurance, I could have that money towards the additional tax that would be imposed, net loss of zero and I may have no deductables, copays etc.  If our healthcare was non profit, the BILLIONS paid out in bonuses and payments etc wouldn't happen.  There would be Trillions of dollars available for good healthcare if the industry was non profit. Whether government run or privately run but non-profit, we could have great healthcare for the amounts of the profits in that industry.<br /><br />Wake up everyone, the money we pay isn't for better healthcare, it's for mansions, yachts and more for the insurance industry.<br /><br />Please take time to see this movie, and read Wendell Potter's book \\"Deadly Spin\\".

B00402FGE4|5.0|So many negative comments about the show.. I thought I'd gave it a try. Am glued to the TV set (watching blu ray version) and couldn't pry myself away. Those who don't like it are most likely comparing this show to the others. I have the whole set of the Atlantis series--yes it's full of actions. This one is a bit different. Don't get me wrong, I love action sci-fi, too, but I really learned about each character (even those I thought I did not like), and feel that they're so ** real **.     Can't wait until the 2nd season comes out as I don't get to see it on the air / cable.     At the same time, I bought Sanctuary. That is one UNEVEN show and what is up with Amanda's horrible accent?     p.s. I pray to Gods in this universe (and beyond) that they don't cancel this show.
B003L20ID8|4.0|There's a scene in \\"Citizen Kane\\" where one of the characters mentions seeing a beautiful girl on a trolley and he regrets not sitting next to her, and not one day goes by where he doesn't think of that girl. We all have experiences and memories like that, we wonder what our lives would have been like if we did sit next to that girl, or if we did talk to her, or get her number (undoubtedly, we lay more importance on these experiences than they may deserve. They're giant `what if' moments in our lives, the path not taken). But what if that moment of decision is the intrusion of destiny or fate? And we we're supposed to be with that person? That is the theme of \\"The Adjustment Bureau.\\"<br /><br />David Norris (Matt Damon) is a fast rising Congressman with a great political future.  As he is set to win his race for the Senate, a revelation comes out that puts his whole political future in question. He goes into a men's room to rehearse his concession speech and meets Elise (Emily Blunt) and they feel that instant attraction of `knowing' they should be together. But circumstances pull them apart, or do they? The next day David catches an adjustment team, headed by Richardson (John Slattery) looking like he kept the wardrobe from \\"Mad Men.\\" The only reason Norris witnesses this is because the adjuster assigned to him, Harry Mitchell (Anthony Mackie), was literally asleep on the job. Richardson convinces David that it's for the best that he forget he ever saw them and that he should forget ever meeting Elise or else his destiny won't be fulfilled. Of course David can't stop thinking of Elise and sets out to find her, and the right to choose the course of his life.<br /><br />\\"The Adjustment Bureau\\" is based on a Philip K.

0061537969|5.0|A great story with a wonderful protagonist that happens to have four legs. Funny, informative, and a real tear-jerker!  You don't want to miss this one.  When I saw it had car racing in the story, I almost passed.  Don't make that mistake!  You will be happy you listened to me.
0440244870|3.0|This is a pure fluff book - something I needed in between serious books and studying.  You cannot take anything in this book too seriously or you might blow your brains out.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This movie was absolutely fabulous!!! If you are an animal lover I highly, highly recommend this. It was inspired by a true story. The ending is somewhat sad, but they put a twist on it that takes the saddness away.
B0021L8V0M|4.0|Originally this movie was written for Tom Cruise but somehow got offered to Jolie but Jolie brings such energy to the role that it is difficult to imagine anyone else but her in this role. As Evelyn Salt, who is a CIA agent on the run after being accused of being a double agent for the Russians. Superb production values along with some very superb twists, turns, car chases and action make this fare palatable. Philip Noyce, the director has promised a sequel. Four stars. 2/25/11
B002QQ8HAG|5.0|Having worked with both Anna and Grace in the UK as a model of the 60's, both women were determined and dedicated individuals.  My druthers ~ Grace, both of us are X Mary Quant Models, Grace prior to myself, she worked her way from an amazing model with that FABULOUS red mane to where she is today. Precise and the MOST amazing Creative Director of all times! I rank Grace up with Diana Vreeland with making VOGUE what it is today.  Anna, so well preceived by Merle Streep in the \\"DEVIL WEARS PRADA\\"  Another great in my \\"Fashion Library of Film\\" and a ++++++ for ALL Fasionistas~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Murph
B0034G4P7G|5.0|Sometimes all the hype about a movie is justified. Social Network based on the book the Accidental Billionaires about the founding of Facebook and its founders deserves all the praise. It is simply a brilliantly acted, directed, and written movie. The movie maybe based on fiction and embellished facts but at the heart it is a tale of ambition, loyalty, friendship, betrayal and youthful innocence corrupted by success. One of the reasons that this movie is watchable is because of the writing, acting and direction. David Fincher, Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Aaron Sorkin all deserve a standing ovation. Highly recommended. 3/1/2011
B002ZG976U|2.0|First of all, Cher was fantastic!  Tucci is seriosly on a a slippery slope of being typecast as the \\"gay designer/costumer/whatever\\"..even though he handles the roles  well.  Watch \\"The Lovely Bones\\" if you want to see him do a really unlikable character wth the greatest of ease.  I found myself fastforwarding through many of the musical performanes after enduring a few of them, they weren't bad, just boring.  And other than Tess, not one of  the characters are worth the time to care about.      I find it odd that so many people are comparing Burlesque to Striptease, Chicago and Showgirls.  Showgirls is so bad it's funny, and even though I will always think that Renee Zellweger is a terrible Roxy Hart, I loved Chicago.  Striptease?  Pretty sure that is the stinker that tanked Moores career.
B001MEJY8W|3.0|If you like horror films, be prepared the imagery that you will witness is gruesome and sickening that at the end of the film you will be numb from it. This type of horror comes mostly from physical abuse, child torture and from all kinds of pain that can be inflicted on the human body. The central theme is revenge and this vendetta tale starts early without letting up, there are at least four gruesome murders in the first 20 minutes if I correctly remember. Although this movie had a pretty okay story line, the pace slackens a lot in the middle. The ending had a interesting premise and makes you think. Just three stars for this one 2/18/2011
B004132HZS|5.0|I heard about this series on NPR but missed the episodes when they initially aired on PBS Mystery. When I heard others talking about them I tried to find an online site that was streaming them -- not easy to do. But after viewing them myself online I wanted to talk about them.  The problem was that none of my friends or family had seen them either.  When I found Season 1 at a great price from a seller on the Amazon site, I bought the set so I could loan them out to my family and friends.  When the set came, I watched all the episodes again.  I'm passing them around, but now there's a long waiting list of people who want to view them!!  Everyone who sees an episode is hooked.  And it's made for some really fun conversations as everyone has their favorite part.  Highly, highly recommended!!  The one downside is that Season 1 consists of only three episodes.  So we're all waiting for Season 2 to start up.
B004B63M1S|3.0|Machete is one of the movies that remind me so much of the Indian movies that I grew up watching when I was a child. A lone crusader, who can destroy a small army of thugs, gets to romance all the ladies, ultimately prevails. Danny Trejo is Machete, whose family has been killed by Steven Seagal. He is such a natural fit for this role with his deadpan expression, rugged frame; he gets to deliver the funniest lines in the movie thanks to a wickedly written script. This movie is set against the backdrop of border politics and has a slew of characters with Robert De Niro playing his silliest role in years. If you want entertainment and hefty doses of action, nudity, violence and ridiculousness then this is the film to watch. Pretty enjoyable for what it is....Four stars. 2/20/11
0316098337|3.0|Each year, a new Booker prize award committee announces its titles shortlist amidst great fanfare and invariably proclaiming it as the strongest set in years. As many of us readers would have found out, that kind of assessment is as objective and helpful as that of a recording artiste heralding each new release as his strongest album ever. The increasing incidence of duds appearing in shortlists has sadly discredited the judgment of experts who either have very different taste from the reading public or are simply way off in their selection. This year's Booker prize winner, \\"The Finkler Question\\" has attracted so many negative reviews from readers I cannot quite summon up my usual enthusiasm as I begin my trawl through the 2010 shortlist.     Emma Donoghue's \\"Room\\" seemed a safe bet. Sadly, I was never more irritated and frustrated reading the book, which I wanted very much to like but couldn't wait to finish.     The premise for the book - the story of a small boy, Jack, growing up captive in isolation with his mum (Ma) but for the occasional visitation of their captor Old Nick - is arguably novel and though likely inspired by true events isn't in my opinion remotely exploitative as some others have suggested. It wouldn't be the first time the narrative is voiced by a small child - remember Mark Haddon's \\"The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night Time\\" ? - but there's a special purpose to it in \\"Room\\". The story has to be told from the vantage perspective of somebody whose world and reality is defined exclusively by his restricted surroundings. So it isn't a gimmick - it wouldn't work for instance to have his mother tell the story. Remember, she's been out there before, though a long time ago.    The book can be divided into two parts - \\"before\\" and \\"after\\" escape. The \\"before\\" segment is better with more thrilling bits. The \\"after\\" segment dealing with the coping process has its share of drama but is comparatively flat.  But what surprised me most of all was that I couldn't get past even the first few pages of the book. I found myself stopping and starting as I wrestled painfully with the incoherent babble and self conscious baby talk, the quick succession toggling between dialogue and inner monologue, often reading and re-reading whole chunks of mother and son dialogue to make sense of it until I finally gave up. I figured, what they're on about isn't very interesting anyway so I sped read through most of it except when Old Nick made his appearances. Odd, but I liked it more when Old Nick was around.       In all fairness, the book has its merits. Donoghue nailed Ma's post-escape frustration with her own mother and the outside world right in the centre. They seemed to judge her like she was one of them, forgetting that Jack was her world during her captivity years (eg, like why was she was still breast feeding Jack at his age ?). But what finally blew it for me was Donoghue's decidedly shaky grasp of Jack's narrative voice - one moment sounding like a small boy or toddler even (using adjectives like \\"strong\\" as a noun, etc) and the next moment, making utterances or enunciating thoughts that only adults could have. This kind of failure is fatal to a book with such ambition - it makes it less believable.     Undoubtedly, many readers have enjoyed \\"Room\\". I know I didn't but I have no regrets reading it. At least I know why it didn't work for me.
B00275EHJQ|5.0|Extremely well made, that is the least I can say. This is the last in the trilogy which takes Woody to the daycare to save his friends. I think this was the best in the series and I can safely say that the most hardened should would find it hard not to tear up when Andy says good bye to his toy friends at the end of the movie, passing the torch to a new caretaker. Five stars. 2/26/2011
B003IPC5SO|4.0|This is a great album to listen to in the car. For most of the tracks you can sing along. Instrumentals are actually somewhat creative and well mixed. You can blast this cd without it being too annoying. Kylie sounds great. There is no song on this below a 3/5 rating and most are 4/5 or 5/5. Must have for Kylie Fans. I would recommend this CD if you like electronic dance music and even Daft Punk.
0802798233|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, It nice to get away from the supernatural romance now and again and read a boy/ girl romance and escape in the book. It has everthing, a great story, funny, it has sex but not too graphic and you never want to put it down.  It is one of my favourites and is a MUST READ book.
B0049OSQ18|5.0|This is my favorite Decemberists CD yet. The melodies and harmonies are gorgeous, and as always the lyrics are stunning, although perhaps a bit simpler than previously. I have listened to it daily since I got it and it's not getting old.
B004FQKY5Q|5.0|The idea of bands writing and performing their own material has become a lost art these days. It seems as if every single pop act out there is pre-packaged, drenched with auto-tune, and overseen by the likes of Max Martin, Tricky Stewart, and Dr. Luke. To their credit, Per Gessle and Marie Fredrickson never needed that, because Gessle has a knack for constructing perfect little pop tunes. And with Fredrickson's unmistakable voice, the duo has left us with numerous pop classics that stick in the head for days, weeks, even years after you listen to them.<br /><br />Roxette has never received it's proper due, however, because they are dismissed by some critics as merely a guilty pleasure. But the duo takes a step back from that on this record, producing their most organic set of power-pop tunes yet. Some of the synths and electronic elements remain (\\"Big Black Cadillac\\"), but even on the songs that are fun and upbeat (\\"Way Out\\") the blips and blats give way to strumming guitars and layered vocals. The drums are turned up in the mix, and the vocals shine. Gessle is in the finest voice he's ever been in, and Fredrickson is her usual, reliable self with her amazing voice.<br /><br />Of the twelve songs, there are a few clunkers, notably the slower ballads (which oddly was always their forte). But when they are on, Roxette produces some of their best work. \\"Dream On\\" is one of the best songs Gessle ever wrote, and \\"She's Got Nothing On (But the Radio)\\" is an instant pop classic. Overall, this is a nice little gem of an album by two underrated musicians who many might have considered past their prime.
B000I0QKDS|5.0|Hadn't heard this for years/decades but it is as good as I remember it. Rod was a blues singer, not a pop crooner, and Beck's guitar is amazing: blues, rock, and intensity, and it has not lost anything in the intervening years. A great purchase.
B003EV6DBM|3.0|Overall, less serious tone, less back story, more running.  In terms of the main episodes, generally solid - although did seem excessive to use so many monsters in the finale.  The soundtrack volume is intermittently off - volume is lower on the episodes and occasionally fades.  Production quality and content on the Confidential episodes and video diaries were disappointing in comparison to previous series.
B004AHNIGM|4.0|A great new bunch of songs from a reborn Gregg Allman. Some of the songs don't even sound like him, but that's not necessarily bad--he really gets into the blues groove. Every time I listen to it I like a different song the most, although \\"Floating Bridge\\" is so haunting it will always be a favorite. If you are an Allman fan, you should get it, and if you are a blues fan, you should get it. Don't be put off by his jam-band past; this is great music.
B00006AG9J|5.0|first and foremost, this album shouldn't be slammed so much. it may seem like cluttered noise here and there, but you must keep in mind the band thought this was initially a joke. they just had a fun little jam session, and someone thought they should be signed. it's far from pretentious, and it's an unexpected piece of work. it may seem directionless, but to me it's atmospheric and immersive. all five pieces are chaotic works of art. just as creative as anything else from this era of their career. could be considered a staple in early electronic music
B003Y5H53S|4.0|This is a rather unique film, a modern days, old-timey western.  It's not quite as funny as I hoped it would be.  However, it is still an enjoyable viewing experience.  It features quirky characters of the Coen brothers variety.  You have to wonder if the writer of Rango is a fan of the Coen brothers, and was intentionally aiming for that.<br /><br />There is a moment in the movie where Rango reminds me a bit of Barney Fife (the late, great Don Knotts' \\"The Andy Griffith Show\\" character).<br /><br />The animation by Industrial Light & Magic is fantastic.  Just such wonderful artistry and detail.<br /><br />This movie is a bit more adult than the typical animated movie fare.  In terms of violence and death.  So, parents might want to watch it first before taking their kids to see it.
1439102724|4.0|But I am not saying this is a bad Picoult book! I just didn't love it the way I did some others (particularly Songs of the Humpback Whale, House Rules, and Salem Falls).  All of the things that make Picoult stand out as an author - her ability to make you connect with her characters even if you disagree with them, to question your own beliefs, to laugh and cry while still on the same page - are still there.  The book begins with Zoe's struggles to conceive and the deterioration of her relationship with Max.  Picoult's details hook you right away.  As a lesbian and huge Picoult fan I assumed I would love this book immediately given the subject matter.  However my biggest issues with the book are actually Zoe's easy acceptance of her lesbianism and the quickness of her relationship with Vanessa.  Everyone knows a lesbian bring a U-Haul to the second date, but there are always crazy intense emotions that go along with it.  Picoult does a better job attempting at this through Vanessa's perspective.  I wish Picoult had put half as much effort into this as she did the pregnancy issues.  Surprisingly I actually found myself more interested in Max and Liddy than Zoe and Vanessa.  Overall I think it's another great book by an amazing author.  And the added CD is a wonderful bonus.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was waiting in line at a local theater with my 12-year-old granddaughter to see the new Tron movie and got into a conversation with the woman behind me about children's books. She recommended The Hunger Games to me. Well, I just finished reading it and it is way, way better than that stupid movie was!<br /><br />Hunger games explores what happens to people placed in extreme poverty and constant exposure to death can do to people, especially to children. In this book, the people effectively live in the equivalent of the Warsaw Ghetto during Nazi Germany. There is a brutal ruling class that keeps the local people at the brink of starvation. Does that really make everyone cruel and indifferent? What if you add in an equivalent to the Roman gladiator games but populate them with children?<br /><br />The book is engaging and thought provoking. Fast moving and yet thoughtful. I couldn't put it down and finished it in just a couple of days. Oddly, I don't feel a big rush to read the second book and I think that is because I'm slightly disappointed by the ending.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|After reading the reviews I felt this would be a good movie--I wasn't disappointed.  The first few minutes can be deceiving--but keep watching and suddenly it becomes now-stop excitement! Lots of twists and turns, along with some very humorous lines.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I've always been a Bruce Willis fan and he doesn't disappoint in this!
B004L3AR0K|4.0|For those who enjoy romantic comedies, I would say this movie rates 4/5. For those who are not fans of the genre, you would probably rate this movie 2 or 3 stars.<br /><br />Love and Other Drugs follows the same predictable path that most American romantic comedies follow. Maggie (Anne Hathaway) and Jamie (Jake Gylenhaal) do not like each other at first, slowly develop an attachment to each other, have a couple fights, etc...you get the picture. If you're looking for a movie that has a remarkable plot, this is not the one.<br /><br />But \\"Love and Other Drugs\\" may still hold some value to you. For one, there are a couple of nudity scenes, basically of topless women, which I guess would appeal to those who are looking for something provocative. And in the backdrop you find out about Jamie's incredibly successful career. After Jamie got fired from his salesman job at the electronics store, he began selling drugs to doctor's offices, and through his connections he found out about selling Viagra, which was a new drug in the 1990s, when this movie was set. It's surprising that a man with no academic background in the sciences nor business becomes a major pharmaceutical businessman, but that's what happened. You also find out about Maggie's struggle with Parkinson's disease at such a young age, and how her tensions and Jamie's ambitions clash and cause arguments between the two.<br /><br />I'm not sure if Maggie's story is based on something, but Jamie's life as a salesman is based on a true story. You can read  [[ASIN:B002QGSVF2 Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman]] to find out more. Or, you could skip the book and watch the movie. Or, if you don't like overdone romantic comedies and/or nudity, you could skip out on the movie altogether.
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|Loreena McKennitt returns to her roots with a collection of Celtic inspired music. There are some classic folk songs and a composition by McKennitt. Also included is an interpretation of William Butler Yeats' Down by the Sally Gardens, which incidentally Yeats attributes to folk music he heard as a child in Ireland. McKennitt has frequently used the poetry of Yeats and always introduces me to new interpretations of this great poet's work. Her voice remains clear and expressive and the instrumentation is a perfect balance to her vocal abilities. Like most Celtic music, the themes of young love and tragedy predominate, but the Celts had a wonderful way of reaching deep emotional resonance with their melodies, arrangements, and lyrics. McKennitt does a wonderful interpretation. The songs focus on Celtic music and are a bit different from McKennitt's more recent experimentation and integration of world music. The instruments used often include Celtic fiddles with their ability to bring dance and pep to some selections and mournful moods to others. An great collection.
B00004R99F|5.0|The original \\"A Goofy Movie\\" was a fairly popular movie for young children in the 1990s. It would be a great addition to the collection of any adult who grew up during that time and loves movies that make them nostalgic. For today's youngsters, who are used to cartoons like \\"Phineas and Ferb\\" and \\"Toy Story 3\\", I think this movie may not be as interesting, but an okay choice anyway.<br /><br />While you may have enjoyed this movie as a kid for its entertainment value, you might notice many references to popular culture: Mickey Mouse appearances, tons of other Disney movies, a Michael Jackson parody, and much more! The cross-country road trip is rather enjoyable, the romance between Max and Roxanne is cute, and the movie's soundtrack is pretty good too. Some of the songs are kind of cheesy, but I thought the last song \\"Eye to Eye\\" and the background music was great.<br /><br />I think this movie teaches a lot of life lessons as well. A vacation can be a great bonding experience for people with a rocky relationship. Parents need to accept at some point that their children are growing up, and children need to understand that often, parents are looking out for the children's best interests. And, adults should take other people's advice with a grain of salt, because Pete's suggestions to Goofy didn't exactly work out.<br /><br />All in all, it's a great kids/family movie.
B0010358D0|4.0|This movie has better cinematic sequences when compare to the original appleseed movie. The camera placement and camera moves were more carefully designed and implemented. The plot is fair but there are no new big-surprises in terms of weapons, and machines.    The extra features have an English voice track hence it is a lot easier to watch.    If you are a fan of the first movie, you will definitely enjoy this second movie. If you are new to the series, the enjoyment of the movie may depend on other factors. I will give it 8 out of 10.
B003L20IFQ|5.0|In order to appreciate this movie you must watch it more than once, to understand the talent of this brilliant actor.  What he does in this film is so on the edge of your seat thriller.  Everytime I watch it I enjoy it more and more!
B0040JHXTI|5.0|I was very excited when I heard about its release, and it did not disappoint.  A must for the Bruce fan!  Well worth the money spent.
B002T921DE|5.0|I OWN MORE THAN 50 BLU-RAY CONCERTS....AND THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES BECAUSE OF THE PERFECT SOUND AND PICTURE QUALITY.
B004B8DH98|1.0|1 Hour and 46 minutes of my life I will never get back. The movie is way to slow and could be told in less than half the time. Clooney was good as usual but he can't make up for a bad storyline. Thumbs Down.
0143115014|2.0|Turin (a man with a scientific background and reputation of knowing perfumery) and Sanchez(a MakeupAlley fragrance-loving reviewer that apparently caught his eye) compiled their reviews into this book together. Marriage and a book blossomed!  Both try too hard ( especially Sanchez) to be funny. And strangely lots of fine fragrances(whether popularly known or from obscure niche houses) are omitted from reviews altogether. It's a sort of haphazard, cobbled-together book.   Don't make your fragrance purchases based on their opinions - though they may seem to be 'experts' in the field. Decide for yourself, as fragrance and what pleases our individual noses are delightfully individual and should always be celebrated.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this following a friend's recommendation and am so happy I did. This is a great book, it grabs you from the beginning and you can't help but finish it. This is not a teen book, it's so much more, other than the main character been a teenager there is nothing else to prevent a more mature reader from loving it, I know I did. It's so deep and violent and wonderfully written. I moved right to the rest of the series after finishing it and devoured those too. I give it  5 1/2 stars. I am originally from a communist country and it felt so close to my memories, all that oppression and control. My recommendation, read it ... buy it or get it from the library but it's not a waste of time.
B0036EH3WK|4.0|I never watched the series in prime time but recently completed watching via Netflix over a period of months.    I have mixed emotions about the series as a whole since I found it quite entertaining and engaging at times and a bit silly and hokey at other times.  I agree with some of the other reviews that the first few seasons were the best and it feels rushed in the last couple of seasons, as though they knew they were heading for a conclusion.    The best parts come when the Oceanic 815 survivors are debating and arguing about strategy and motives, many of those involving Locke, who I think was the most intriguing of all.  I had a soft spot for Hugo and Desmond, maybe because they were the most sincere and trustworthy.  Michael Emerson is terrifically evil as Ben and delivers the best one liners.    The story arc in Lost was a bit hard to follow at times with all of the time shifting and double dealing, but the use of the flashback, flash-forward, and the \\"flash sideways\\" were excellent ways to make me understand and care about the characters on the island.  It was sad when someone died because you had grown to like them, even with all of their faults.    I haven't seen the blu-ray addition, but imagine that it is quite good.  Lost is a show that lends itself to great bonus features (I got a kick out of the \\"summary in 8:15\\" segments).    The \\"Dharma Initiative\\" products that helped keep the survivors alive remind me of the old generic products that used to be on store shelves in the plain cans and boxes.  I keep thinking I'll run into one at Safeway or somewhere!
0393327345|1.0|This book bored me and I can't believe the movie was much better.  It's sick in many ways, gross, and overly dark.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|I just started watching last evening and finished the first 4 episodes.  It is very interesting and comical, the English sure have a flair when it comes to producing series or movies!! nothing like it. I am looking forward to watching another 4 episodes this afternoon. I highly recommend Little Dorrit.
0756404738|5.0|Normally I wouldn't wait four years for a book. Usually after the first couple years I give up on the author, especially if it's part of a projected series or trilogy (yes I mean you GRRM!). However, 'The Name of the Wind' by Patrick Rothfuss is easily one of my all-time favorite novels. Never has a fantasy story come off as charming and engaging and despite my doubts over the long development time I was more than willing to give the sequel a shot. Now 'Wise Man's Fear' is finally out (the second in the projected 'Kingkiller Chronicles' trilogy) and while it's a bit longer than it's predecessor I can say that the four year wait was more than worth it!<br /><br />'Wise Man's Fear' picks up directly after the events of 'Name of the Wind'. Kvothe is a legendary figure who's presumed dead and running a small town Inn. Over the course of 3 days Kvothe is retelling his life-story to a chronicler who knows his real identity. In his story (the book's story within a story) the young Kvothe is still at the University from the first novel and is still butting heads with Ambrose, a rival student. After being forced into leaving the University Kvothe travels to Severen where he gets caught up in courtly politics and uncovers an assassination attempt. He also helps mercenary warriors battle bandits, trains under the mysterious Adem and ends up having his legendary meeting with the Felurian. Adding to this Kvothe develops his charming (if predictable) relationship with the sly but beautiful Denna and continues his vengeful search for the Chandrian: the creatures who murdered his parents when he was a child.<br /><br />Needless to say this 1000+ page book covers a lot of ground. As with 'Name of the Wind', Patrick Rothfuss shows un-matched strength in writing charming characters, fascinating (if not entirely unique) world details, sharp dialogue, beautiful songs and manages to keep up with the never-ending sense of wonder and adventure! 'Wise Man's Fear' is also very long and is just as, if not more, leisurely paced than 'Name of the Wind' and can sometimes be a bit too self-indulgent (and long-winded). This didn't bring the experience down for me (and more times than not adds to the charm of the book) but after so many long expository-passages about Kvothe's abilities and the workings of alchemy, sympathy, and naming in the first book I found myself skipping over some of these passages in 'Wise Man's Fear'.<br /><br />Even at it's lowest point, 'Wise Man's Fear' is one of the most rewarding novels I've ever read (fantasy or otherwise). By the end I was left wanting as there were still a lot of unresolved threads (even more so than 'Name of the Wind') but I was never once disappointed. This book is a must read and while new readers should definitely start with 'Name of the Wind', know 'Wise Man's Fear' is just as strong and engagingst as, if not more, leisurely paced than 'Name of the Wind' and can sometimes be a bit too self-indulgent (and long-winded). This didn't bring the experience down for me (and more times than not adds to the charm of the book) but after so many long expository-passages about Kvothe's abilities and the workings of alchemy, sympathy, and naming in the first book I found myself skipping over some of these passages in 'Wise Man's Fear'.<br /><br />Even at it's lowest point, 'Wise Man's Fear' is one of the most rewarding novels I've ever read (fantasy or otherwise). By the end I was left wanting as there were still a lot of unresolved threads (even more so than 'Name of the Wind') but I was never once disappointed.

B0001XLXDO|5.0|I fell in love with the music more than I did with the movie. However, the movie is growing on me. But it is definitely the music that makes it. The songs are so well written, arranged, and sung. I love the old rock and roll feel to the songs. It doesn't sound like a typical musical soundtrack. It is just great!
B003UESJFQ|5.0|MADE IN DAGENHAM is sort of a British version of NORMA RAE.<br /><br /> The film, based on a true story, is set in the late 1960s.  It tells of a group of English women, employed at the Ford Motor Factory, who took on management and their own union by going out on strike, insisting on equal pay for equal work.<br /><br /> The always charming Sally Hawkins, playing an ordinary working class wife and mother, becomes the unexpected leader of the revolt, encouraged by her sympathetic union representative (Bob Hoskins) and, surprisingly, the attractive wife (Rosamund Pike) of the plant's manager, a highly educated, intelligent woman who, as a female, feels the same lack of respect from the men in her life.<br /><br /> Like the Sally Field classic, MADE IN DAGENHAM is one of those \\"stand up and cheer\\" movies that climaxes when the striking women meet with Miranda Richardson, the British Secretary of State.  The film has a superb screenplay by William Ivory and was directed by Nigel Cole.  Also in the well-chosen cast are Geraldine James, Jamie Winstone, Rupert Graves, Nicola Duffett and Richard Schiff, who plays the tough American Ford representative, sent to the UK to put those striking women in their place.<br /><br /> My only complaint with this otherwise excellent entertainment is the fact that, because England and the United States do not share a common language, some of the dialogue is difficult to understand.<br /><br />© Michael B.

B000002GL4|1.0|This was a single cd, I thought it was the double cd or else I would not have ordered it.
B00005JLKB|4.0|I ordered this used in good condition. I did have to re-glue part of the dvd binding back together. Other than that the dvd's work good. I will probably look for \\"used, great/excellent condition\\" next time I buy.
B002ZG99N6|4.0|in this film, starring, co-written and directed by Ben Affleck. In the beginning, the film makes a (somewhat exaggerated) claim about the vast number of bank robbers who come from this small part of Boston, and that it is a profession that is passed on from father to son. Doug MacRay, played by Ben Afleck, is a career criminal who has come up within this environment. He is quite good at what he does and he is quite close to the other members of his gang--they are like family--yet he is conflicted about being a bank robber. His conflict solidifies to the point that he absolutely wants out after he develops a love interest in a young woman who is a bank manager at a bank which, unknown to her, he has just robbed. Through this relationship, as well as his relationship with his imprisoned father and the contrast with the character Jem, the humanity of \\"Dougy\\" is revealed. I also found it interesting to learn more about his family and background as the film progressed. In the end, Doug is pressed to participate in one last heist, of none other than Fenway Park, and things get very dicey. Some astute detective work from the FBI headed by Jon Hamm as Special Agent Adam Frawley brings them to a confrontation at Fenway, which complicates things. Will they will get away with the crime, and will Doug will get away from \\"The Town\\", as he wishes, and what will happen with his \\"tuney\\" (yuppie) girlfriend?  I thought that the film did a decent job resolving these issues, and it held my interest pretty well throughout. Recommend.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|AWESOME! These shows just keep getting better with each one!! Although the books are soooooo much more detailed and explains so much more than any of the movies. The movies are great though, don't get me wrong!
B00003CXBH|5.0|What a wonderful movie. It is inspiring and idealistic and yet firmly grounded in the reality of human beings and our natural tendency toward sin.  The DVD is great - especially the short film about how the movie was made and how the villagers were relocated and taken care of during the shoot.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I give so much props and credit to Jillian Michaels, she's amazing. The only thing with this workout is that after doing it 2 weeks to a month my knees starting hurting so bad. I had read reviews before I bought this about other people saying their knees would hurt after a while but I thought I would try it anyway, everyone has a different pain tolerance. Once I stopped using this workout about a week or two later my knees stopped hurting. I love the workout, it's great I just wish it didn't make my knees hurt.
B002ZG99CM|5.0|This was a very good movie all those saying it wasn't need to get over themselves and shut up. They weren't trying to make the movie the same as the original. No one forced you to watch it. I recommend this to anyone especially those with kids.Jaden Smith was amazing in this movie besides the fact his parents produced this movie. He is a very talented little boy. He will do great things.

B003L20ID8|5.0|I love Matt Damon in this movie. This is his best role since the Bourne movies. This movie has a good mix of thriller and romance. The chemistry between Emily Blunt and Matt Damon was great. I can't wait to buy it on DVD.
B002D0L0R2|1.0|This 2007 version of Hair Spray is neither funny nor does it give an authentic picture of the 60s. In case no one else has noticed the music in this camp version is strictly 70s disco. The 2007 movie is also over-produced.     The 1988 John Waters \\"Hairspray\\" is so much better that there is no comparison plus the music in the 1988 movie is completely authentic. Being 12 in 1962, I recognized all of the music and remember watching \\"American Bandstand\\" which it spoofed. Motor Mouth Mabell seems to have been based on Detroit's own \\"Martha Jean, the Queen,\\" even though it ostensibly took place in Baltimore.    As for casting: the guys in the \\"lady's choice\\" line up, I could swear I knew in high school, casting did such a good job. From the costumes, to the music, to the casting, to the funny lines, to Sonny Bono's acting the 1988 version blows the 2007 version \\"out of the water.\\" In short, this 2007 camp extravaganza STINKS.
1594489505|5.0|This book is by far the best book I have read so far in my life. The characters are so well-rounded and the author tells the story beautifully. I know I will come back to this book and read it again and again. I recommended this book to anyone of all ages and cultures. I just could not of put this book down! I got so much out of it, and will never forget this memorable piece of art!
B0006HBZXS|4.0|Awesome adventure and character study of survival in the Alaskan wilderness.  With Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin who are superb, as are their costars and the amazing Bart-the Bear.<br />This film held my interest til the very end.  I Recommend it, for adult audiences.<br /><br />*Also see the movie entitled simply \\"The Bear\\".
1594202559|5.0|I recommend Sebastian Mallaby's book, More Money Than God, if you are at all curious about how hedge funds work.  The writing style resembles Malcolm Gladwell or Michael Lewis in that a technical subject is made interesting and straightforward by anecdote-driven narrative.  It made me want to join a hedge fund or at least start actively investing my own money.  Mallaby also focuses on the two things every economist wonders about hedge funds- do they produce social value, and how can they make money if markets are efficient.
B0034G4OZE|1.0|There are certain traits or markers that immediately alert me that a movie is coming out of New York or similar environs.   (1.) It's a romantic comedy-tragedy.   (2.) It's filmed at a location most Noreasterners are likely to have some familiarity with (or romanticize about) and find entertaining  -  a mental institution.   (3.) A stereotypic caricature and hodgepodge of ethnic and geriatric patients behaving in a manner only writers and studios could imagine. Likely learned by this film's writers/directors from watching similar older movies of the same persuasion which in turn probably learned their stereotypes from still even older \\"mental\\" movies.   (4.) Sexual innuendo.   (5.) Teen romantic conflict and resolution and obligatory escape scene usually involving a roof top. Purpose: To expand the demographic market.   Boring!! Except, for slightly above average facial expressions acting by Gilchrist.  Everyone else's acting was pretty much read-the-script for your particular stereotypic role.

B003MZ0I84|5.0|This may be one of the best albums I have heard. Maroon 5 is such a great band in general and this album proves it. It may be a little different from their previous works, but it is a great leap for them. If you love even just one of Maroon 5's songs, I would definitely buy this album. So worth the money rather than illegally downloading.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|Cleaning up Dirt!  Rango Rides!<br /><br />What a fun film!<br /><br />Rango (we never really find out his real name) has created a fantasy world inside his little terrarium, being an actor and his stage  includes a headless Barbie doll, a wind-up goldfish, a tree and a lake.  An unfortunate accident throws him out of his interior world and though he does not know it yet, gives him the purpose he has always craved.<br /><br />After some chat with a philosophical armadillo, he makes it to Dirt, a western town that must copy stereotypical characters from just about every western film you've ever seen, which is a good thing!<br /><br />Animation:<br /><br />I loved this animation!  Pixar look out!  The attention to detail down to the fire sparks from burned logs, sand and water, even pupils dilating.  Amazing detail and all in glorious 2D (remember 2D?)!<br /><br />Fav Scenes:<br /><br />The story has a few nods to other films that the older viewers may catch, including a parody of Apocalypse Now, with flying bats playing Ride of the Valkeries as they shoot up the good guys trying to get their stolen water back.<br /><br />Rango is an actor and convinces the town that he is a hero and through a few lucky breaks such as killing the local hawk that has been dining on the citizens, they all consider him so.  The slimy mayor however has other plans and is dealing a vicious hand to the detriment of the whole town.  There are some slapstick moments, and a few lines are hilarious:<br /><br />\\"Is this heaven?\\"<br />\\"No.  Eating PopTarts with Kim Novak is heaven!\\"<br /><br />Themes:<br /><br />Pretending to be someone you're not may get you aways, but really finding out who you really are is a start to respect for yourself and others.  Bad guys are not necessarily all bad and can work with you for a common cause.  And finally, those who take advantage of others' needs (the town and its lack of water) will eventually fail.  Karma, you know.<br /><br />Film's Aftermath:<br /><br />The theater was packed with families.  When I left, I heard one man exclaim that this is the most fun he has had in a theater in a long time.

B0036OS3Q0|4.0|I adore these boots. I live in New Hampshire and they are great in the snow. They are so light and fairly easy to slip into. I've had them for a few weeks though and they have become squeaky when I walk, which is upsetting, but I still love them. Also, be careful when wearing dark colored pants. I'm not sure if it is from jeans or navy blue cords, but my boots have a little rim of blue on the inside top. No big deal though, they're still super cute.
0689865384|4.0|As a middle school student who \\"studied\\" Uglies by Scott Westerfeld at school, and one who enjoys such science fiction books, I can tell you that this book is one surely to be enjoyed by middle-schoolers, or any adult who likes science fiction.   This book, Uglies, put in the setting of the future, the world of Tally Youngblood is nothing like it is here, in \\"our world.\\" 2011 has passed millions of years ago, and we, us in 2011 are called the \\"rusties,\\" known for our crazy acts of hideous things like pollution, cutting down trees, and killing animals. Something they wouldn't even think of doing.   In a society of four classes--littlies, uglies, pretties, and specials--well, the name explains it. Up until you're 12, you're a littlie, then when you turn twelve--you live in the dorms of uglies, and when you turn sixteen, you get an operation that changes you--inside out. They rub off your skin, give you new, soft skin, big vulnerable eyes, perfect teeth, nose--everything, almost like being born again, as a new appearance, perfect, pretty. When you're a pretty, your only job is to have fun and party.   To any ugly, being pretty and partying all day seems like the best thing to do--but is it?  As Tally finds a friend who decides to run away from becoming pretty and join a \\"juvenile\\" group of kids and adult uglies who have escaped the operation into turning pretty, Tally must face betrayal, self conflict, and finding the truth to being pretty.  If I were to rate this book, I'd rate it a four. Not a five--that's reserved for the best of best books, and Uglies isn't what you'd call the best of best--it's the ending and structure that ruined my thought of it.   I didn't like simplicity of the book, of the plot. It was basically like almost any other science fiction book that you would find--in the future, in a society of different people, running away, protesting, etc. Many books I read are very similar to it. Another thing was the whole series. Uglies is merely the introduction. Following Uglies is Pretties, Specials, then Extras. Uglies I liked because it was the first book, and although it was similar to the others, it still had a taste to it because it, at least, had different details and plot. However, the following books were too predictable, too similar to the first book, almost the same format as Uglies, and I found myself in a guessing game with \\"I bet this is going to happen next\\" and the titles gave the away, too (if you haven't read it, you wouldn't understand). Therefore, I found Pretties and Specials boring and tedious. However, the little details and \\"mini-plots\\" were what were more interesting--which is the mere reason I continued to read (and the curiosity of what the ending would be like). I liked Extras, because it was quite different than the prior three books of the series, but it was pretty much the same thing--except instead of everyone wanting to be pretty, everyone wanted to be popular--pretty much coming across the same idea that I said before, if everyone's pretty, then is anyone pretty?  I find this book would be hard to understand for younger readers in elementary schools, no matter how easy the words itself are. The meaning behind a book is what is most important, to my opinion, which, therefore, concludes to my suggestion that this book should be mainly for people at the age 11 and up. You really need to listen to the hidden messages of the metaphors and the \\"behind the lines\\" meaning to not just read this book as \\"any other science fiction book.\\"  Of course, I have read this once on my own, and once again at school. One would understand that in school, you go more \\"in depth\\" of the book and \\"dissect\\" it more than you would if you were just reading it for fun. The book is a good read, full of metaphors that you can try to understand, and it is such a clever plot, how everything weaves together to form that one last ending. There was one \\"moral,\\" you could call it, that formed around the book, and if you paid enough attention to the story and \\"behind the scenes,\\" as some often say, you would realize that it also came across a very important point that applies to us today. Not just \\"don't pollute,\\" but the thought of, if everyone's pretty, then is anyone pretty? The standard of normal changes from `ugly' to `pretty,' so if everyone's pretty, being pretty is being normal--nothing special after all, nothing special about you being pretty. The book gave a meaning to the reader that being \\"like everyone else\\" isn't always the best idea, which is why this book suits middle-schoolers more than adults, when they are in the midst of getting independent and thinking of things themselves. As a quote on some book covers of Uglies suggests, \\"In a world of extreme beauty, anyone normal is ugly.\\" Tally isn't appreciating herself as herself. Being compared to those with extreme beauty isn't the best way to live, and to Tally, she and other uglies are hideous, and need the operation to become pretty. To us, this tells us not to be depressed that we are \\"different,\\" because being different is not bad at all, and in some ways, is better than being like \\"everyone else.\\"  After reading this book, I thought again about how our world is right now, and how we can improve it. It made me think to appreciate myself as how I am, and also that being \\"like everyone else\\" isn't always the best thing.
0743496736|4.0|The novel Nineteen Minutes by Jodi Picoult is about a city that endures the tragedy of a high school shooting. The main character, Josie Cormier, is faced with the challenge of suffering the repercussions of witnessing a high school shooting. Although the novel was very well-written, it contains many cliches that are predictable and typical to a teenage life. Picoult's characters relate too much to the \\"typical high school students\\". They reflect all of the \\"cliques\\" seen in movies and TV series almost too perfectly. All of the teenage characters live a \\"typical teenage life\\" where they are constantly fighting with their family, being selfish and problematic. The plot also contained too much irony that seems to be unrealistic. For example, the witness of the shooting is the daughter of the city's best judge. In addition, the city in which they live in, is a small, ideal, and quiet residence where nothing ever goes wrong up until this shooting. Although Picoult uses many cliches and predictable concepts, the novel was very easy to relate to. Many high school students know what it is like to walk down the halls and not be noticed. Picoult captures the essence of this almost perfectly by sharing the thoughts and emotions of both the \\"popular\\" and \\"nerdy\\" crowds. I also enjoyed the many court scenes that were portrayed through out the story. Because I intend to be a lawyer in the future, these scenes stood out to me, and grabbed my attention, by being suspenseful and making the novel enthralling to read.
B000GIWS6U|5.0|The Bee Gees have been such an awesome musical force for so many years, singing, songwriting, arranging and producing some of the most influential and important songs of the 20th century in my opinion.  It's even more impressive when you realize that they were writing and performing songs as a band as early as 14 years old!  Horizontal is one of three albums they would produce in a 2 year period and a wonderful continuation of the creative flow they were enjoying at that time.<br /><br />The songwriting is strong and their 3 part harmonies really come through on such wonderful songs as \\"World\\" & \\"Massachusetts\\".  They were such great \\"storytellers\\" and their songs seemed to be used as a platform to tell the various tales that they had conceived in their minds.  This album was released right in the middle of the heyday of the \\"British Invasion\\" acts from the UK (Beatles, Stones, Who, Yardbirds, etc) and stood just as tall as any of the albums released by those bands that same year.<br /><br />The Bee Gees were often compared and even mistaken for the Beatles during this period, I've always felt they stood on their own merit and wrote and produced songs that truly established them as their own outstanding band and they along with the Who are my favorite British bands.  This album brings back so many memories as my generation grew up to each of these songs and I highly recommend this album to any and everyone. My Favorite song on the album is \\"With The Sun In My Eyes\\", listen to the gorgeous orchestrations and arrangements on this song and realize they were still teenagers!<br /><br />This album, which came less than a year after their debut, is simply outstanding.  Pay close attention also to \\"Daytime Girl\\" which shows off their great lyrical content and music composition skills.  This album has everything, soft rock, hard rock, country, folk, you name it and it's here.  This is an incredible album and one of my favorites of all time.  It really shows the range and skills of the band and helped establish them as a major force on the music scene.elped establish them as a major force on the music scene.
0321344758|1.0|For a guy that clams to be an expert on usability, this book for me has one fatal readability flaw.     It is peppered with footnotes.  Most are relevant and should be part of the text. Some are references and could be added in a \\"Suggested further reading\\" appendix.  And some are pure noise.    It makes the book hard to read. You read along and hit a footnote. You then need to look down to find out if the footnote is substance or not. Then find you way back to the text.    This book loses nothing and would gain a lot if the footnotes went bye-bye.
B000KN7BOA|5.0|Ah yes! The year was 1967 and a band led by 3 brothers born on the Isle of Man who then later moved from Manchester, England to Australia while still very young, were about to begin a now almost 45 year journey of masterful compositions, perfect 3 part harmonies along with songs and albums that would change popular music for all times. The Bee Gees have seen many transformations and incarnations, but the song had remained the same with these guys prior to Maurice's passing (RIP).<br /><br />They produced amazing material and were one of those bands whose catalog would be appreciated by so many from across the musical landscape worldwide. They are mostly and unfairly just remembered for their incredible mid to late 70's material which put them on a level that, overall, may never have been reached before or since. However, this album, their mainstream debut, shows that this band was making great music from it's inception, yes, they were outstanding songwriters and performers in their adopted home of Austrialia as far back as 14 years old!<br /><br />The first song, \\"Turn Of The Century\\" starts us off on a wonderous journey. You hear the brothers displaying their incredible 3 part vocal harmonies that while not unheard of at this time, was certainly at the head of the class at that time. They were beating groups like the Byrds and Beatles at their own game and they were just teens!  The \\"Holiday\\" has such gorgeous orchestrations and vocals and you can hear the deep lyrical content the brothers were able to obtain even at such a young age.<br /><br />\\"Red Chair, Fade Away\\", \\"One Minute Woman\\" & \\"In My Time\\" are great classic mid to late 60's rock and roll songs that shows the band having fun and enjoying the music that's being made. \\"Every Christian Lion Hearted Man Will Show You\\" is one of my all time favorites and along with \\"New York Mining Disaster 1941\\" truly showcases the brothers incredible concepts and lyrical content skill level. There's not a weak moment on this album and each song seems to give you a snapshot of the musical movements throughout the 1960's up to that point which is truly remarkable. .<br /><br />While all 3 brothers were great songwriters, the primary writers listed on this and all of their subsequent albums were Barry & Robin. This is a shame cause Maurice, by all the brothers admissions, was the primary writer of all the melodies and played several intruments on all of their albums. They were every bit the writers of any of the other great writers who were a part of the british invastion time period. They are not given the full credit for the brillant music they produced which has stood the test of time as contemporaries like Townshend/Entwhistle, Jaggar/Richards, Page/Plant, Lennon/McCartney, Waters/Gilmour, etc. They should be at the beginning of every conversation when the topic of greatest songwriting tandems is discussed.<br /><br />While this is not technically their \\"1st\\" album (they released 2 previous LP's in Australia) it is, however, as  previously stated, their 1st international album and the first time they achieved true exposure outside of their adopted home of Australia were they were already major stars.  With this album, they would be introduce to the world who would be given a glimpse of what was to come.  With this album they would begin a journey that would take them across the world bringing gorgeous harmonies, majestic melodies and thought provoking lyrics along for the ride.is album and each song seems to give you a snapshot of the musical movements throughout the 1960's up to that point which is truly remarkable. .<br /><br />While all 3 brothers were great songwriters, the primary writers listed on this and all of their subsequent albums were Barry & Robin.

B0040JHWKS|4.0|This is fine, some additional and previously unreleased, stuff from a mixed philosohical period for Bruce's book of work. But it shares a feeling of samenesss, both in terms of music and lyrics, that marks that period. Despite that feeling, though, it's still Bruce and it's still very good.

B00005K3OT|5.0|I was totally prejudiced against this film--must have been the hype around Oscar time some years ago--and refused to see it (As I recall, the ads, in typical Hollywood fashion, concentrated on the \\"naughty bits\\"--which, in context, aren't!--making it seem as if the film were a tiresome piece of slush porn). The other day, however, as I was walking through the store with the big red bullseye logo and saw the DVD selling for $5.00, I thought, for that price, I might as well buy it. Well, I found \\"Chocolat\\" to be a delightful box full of delicious bonbons, a perfect pick-me-up for a case of the Winter Doldrums. I loved the characters (especially Judi Dench, and the children), the French village settings, and the spun-sugar fairytale atmosphere.<br /><br />Fortunately, I had not read some of the more negative Amazon reviews. While watching the film, for instance, it never once occurred to me to look for the dastardly feminist liberal metaphors that some reviewers have intuited. I also realize that French villages are not really like the one in the movie. I took the film at face value, and, my advice is that you do so too.

B003Z6QGGS|4.0|Dave Mustaine has lived his life to the full, along the way making more than a fair share of enemies and countless amounts of band mates whether it be in Metallica or his own band Megadeth, and now approaching 50 Mustaine has put pen to paper to give us his side of events, from his sacking in metallica to disbanding Megadeth due to serious arm injury where he lost most of his feeling in his arm and had to learn to play all over again.     Rather than use this as a chance to get even with people who did him wrong Mustaine actually tries to be as fair as possible, so what could have turned out to be a get even book is actually more of getting the facts straight. The book is full of Dave's rehab stories and actually starts off with Dave in rehab and admitting he actually learned of more ways to get high in rehab rather than getting clean and includes the funny story of when he was sent to rehab after being caught by the police, he attended one meeting and ended up sending Megadeth bass player Dave Ellefson in his place, who actually ended up coming out sober!!     There is obviously one current theme running through the book and that is Metallica and how Dave always kept a close eye on his once former band mates, determined to be bigger and more successful despite the fact he already had a successful career of his own. The classic Megadeth line up of Mustaine, Dave Ellefson, Nick Menza and Marty Friedman are well discussed and gives us an insight to the most successful time of Megadeth's career, however Metallica were always in the background. He also discusses his tough upbringing and how he made money when he was a youngster, there's the many trips to rehab and of course finding God, his martial arts background is also talked about as well as how Alice cooper became his godfather!     The one thing Mustaine never mentions is that maybe if he stayed in Metallica they might not have become as big and that by having them to measure up to it made sure he was always driven to succeed after all very few bands go on to have the success of Metallica. The book finishes before Dave Ellefson returns to Megadeth and before Megadeth would tour with Metallica as part of the big four tour(anthrax and slayer being the other two bands that made up trash metals big four). As the book moves along Mustaine really wworks hard to make his life better and also to let go of grudges so maybe people who have a grudge against Mustaine should do the same and read this fascinating book.
B003F1WM2K|4.0|I won't give this book a bad review--it was wonderful, moving and inspiring--but I want to point out that it is published by Ecco, which is a division of Harper Collins, because Harper Collins is no friend of e-books or the people who read them. The e-book versions of this book contain none of the beautiful images of the print version. On top of that, Harper Collins has decided that libraries who purchase e-books from them can only check the books out 26 times before they \\"expire\\" and have to be purchased by the library again. Some libraries have decided to boycott Harper Collins, and I will certainly start paying attention to who the publisher is the next time I'm thinking about buying a book.

He is not an avid reader, and usually only when he has to for school.  He loved this book, and requested the other two in the series.  He is now reading for fun, which is what we all want for our kids!
B00008J2PG|5.0|This is an excellent film. I remember watching it when I was younger. I finally bought the DVD and still enjoyed it. I feel that this is Gregory Peck's best role and Christopher Plummer plays a great evil nemesis. One might question the choice of John Gielgud playing Pope Pius the XII however. Which brings me to the major flaw in this made for television movie. The portrayal of Pope Pius as, \\"aloof\\" (as it states on the back of the box) and having him pressure Monsignor O'Flaherty to stop helping Allied POWs in order to protect the Church, is just plain ludicris. Pope Pius ordered Catholic clergy to help save the lives of Jews which would have had his priests and nuns doing the exact same thing that Monsignor O'Flaherty was doing. Rabbi David G. Dalin is his amazing book [[ASIN:0895260344 The Myth of Hitler's Pope: Pope Pius XII And His Secret War Against Nazi Germany]] details examples of heroic clergy, who helped save lives from the hands of the Nazis, and these clegy told that they were \\"ordered\\" by the pope to do all they could to help save lives. Of course, at the time screenwriter David Butler was flushing out the storyline for his screenplay, Pope Pius XII's reputation had already been destroyed. In 1963 the KGB propaganda machine was behind Rolf Hochhuth's play entitled The Deputy which engineered a false history for Pius and his actions. Although fiction, Pope Pius' reputation was destroyed by one negative biography after another. Despite books by Rabbi Dalin and Joseph L. Lichten's A Question of Judgment and Hungarian Jewry and the Papacy: Pius XII Did Not Remain Silent by Jewish historian Jeno Levai, the lies have prevailed. Including permeating into an otherwise valuable and excellent film such as The Scarlet and the Black.
B0045HCJKS|4.0|There's been a rumor circulating for several years that \\"Westworld\\" is being remade.  There's even a page about it on IMDB saying it will be out in 2012.  But  so far, all that is still is a rumour.  I just rewatched this after originally seeing in the late 70's - and have to say the concept is timeless and Yul Bryner was as scary good in his role as I remembered from before.<br /><br />But, after that many years there was a lot of it I didn't remember.  For example, I didn't remember just how cheezy much of the acting and script were. I also didn't notice before how little true dialogue there was in the movie.  There's a lot of chasing around and action - less actual talk. This might be a good thing - since outside of Yul (who also doesn't speak much), the others including Brolin aren't exactly the world's best actors. Anyway, that can't destroy how well Michael Chrichton (later to become creator of Jurassic Park) could turn out a sci-fi idea that captures the imagination and takes you on a wild ride with it.  Despite any acting/scripting flaws, this is a movie that does take you on that ride.<br /><br />Personally, I'd really like to see them remake it with a more polished look and nuanced script. But, now that Michael Chricton isn't around to fix it up himself - that may be too big of a challenge for Hollywood.  So, I still think it's worth seeing.  I also watched [[ASIN:B004LB5FDG Futureworld]], the sequel, which I enjoyed even more than this one (though it too has a major cheese-factor - there's a bit more depth).  Still, I think they're both worth a watch for any sci-fi classics fan.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Cheesiness aside, for the sheer great concept of it delivered by the sci-fi master Chricton, this is a must-see classic. If you're really not sure if it's for you - you might want to check it out on youtube first before purchasing. The whole thing is available in 10 mins. increments, and you get a sense of whether you'd enjoy it by watching the beginning.
B0036TGSJ4|5.0|\\"Easy-A\\" is a superb, witty and incredibly fresh coming-of-age flick with a razor-sharp script.<br /><br />Olive Penderghast is an intelligent twenty-something woman (Emma Stone). Olive is articulate, grounded and quick with a retort - and definitely not a loose woman who goes with any boy behind the bike shed. In fact her virginity is still 'secretly' intact. Her best friend however is Marianne who hasn't had any part of her anatomy intact for quite some time (a scene-stealing part for Alison Michalka). Marianne has temptress hair, an ample bosom and tight blouses that show you her credentials in no uncertain terms. Possessed of a trashy mouth and practically the campus trollop, Marianne can't wait for her friend Olive to lose her cherry. So in an attempt to alleviate her constant vocal pressurizing, Olive tells Marianne that she has done 'it' at the weekend. She gives Marianne all the necessary details. Big mistake...<br /><br />Next day, Olive's gay friend Brandon (Dan Byrd) hears the delicious news (along with the rest of campus) and is thrilled. He spots an opportunity. Brandon can't stand the pretence any more and asks Olive (in her new found waywardness) to fake making out with him so he can be accepted by all the fit hetro guys in collage. Olive agrees because she feels for Brandon. They stage a hysterically funny make out scene in a bedroom at a party with everyone listening at the door. He emerges as the male stud and hero to the lads. Soon the rumour mill starts and via the net and mobile phones, Olive attains a reputation as sleep-around-central. But then her goer status escalates, bringing down the religious nuts on her immoral ass (a great performance by Amanda Bynes) which causes Olive all sorts of grief - including even losing Todd (Penn Badgley) her childhood pal and real love. So what started out as a harmless joke in a toilet and a helping hand given to a friend in need - turns into a cottage industry that escalates out of control. It's very funny, spunky and consistently entertaining.<br /><br />To hold your own as a lead in something like \\"Easy-A\\" takes real gumption and dare we say it - starpower - and Emma Stone has it. She is just gorgeous in this film - funny, playful and luminous in a way that an actress hasn't been in a very long time. It's a breakthrough part for her. Throw in a great supporting cast like Stanley Tucci (her father), Thomas Haden Church (her teacher), Patricia Clarkson (her mother), Lisa Kudrow (the collage councillor) and Malcolm McDowell (the collage Principal) to name but a few, genuinely cool jokes and one-liners and a jab or two at the tyrants who want to run our lives - and you have a winner on your hands.<br /><br />The BLU RAY image is beautiful too - and there are some great extras with the cast and crew.<br /><br />I loved \\"Easy-A\\" - it's young, it's funny, it's ballsy and sexy too.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour and put it high on your rental/to buy list.nsistently entertaining.

0393061310|5.0|This was a fascinating read. It provides terrific info about and understandings of the history of us humans. However, its explanations, based largely on geography and natural resources, are limited. While these factors undoubtedly affected the history of peoples in different regions of the world, they don't explain why China took off economically in the late 70s and Africa is just beginning to find its economic feet. Why did the colonies of England (U.S., Australia, Canada, N.Z.) mostly recover and thrive after conquest while the colonies of other European countries mostly failed to? The author, Jared Diamond, over-estimates the effects of geography and natural resources while under-estimating the effects of culture on historical outcomes. I don't expect a book to cover all factors within its subject, but I do expect it to provide balanced understanding of how important various factors might be. The author's view of geography as deterministic of outcomes should be challenged; there's a harmfulness to maintaining that humans are hapless victims of their environment. Thankfully, there are books like \\"A Farewell to Alms\\" that provide a different view. At the same time, Jared Diamond has made a real contribution, if biased, to understanding human history. No question that it's an interesting and important book.

B0029358GM|3.0|I don't demand that Wilco be edgy. \\"A Ghost Is Born\\" was too experimental for me, and I was glad when they followed it with the more simple and tuneful \\"Sky Blue Sky.\\" Unfortunately, on \\"Wilco (the Album),\\" they go too far in that direction, and the end product is the blandest thing Wilco has ever released.     It is all impeccably played by the band, and none of the songs is embarrassingly bad by any means. But Jeff Tweedy seems content to be average this time around. When he finally decides to be bold, it takes the form of him boldly ripping off George Harrison's \\"My Sweet Lord\\" in \\"You Never Know.\\" The one attempt at being really dark is \\"Bull Black Nova,\\" a song about a murderer set to a krautrock beat. There's blood everywhere, and he's sorry and he's nervous! This has to be the least convincing murderer you're ever going to meet in a song. There are other songs, like \\"One Wing\\" and \\"Solitaire,\\" that seem to drift off into the ether without making much of an impression at all.     Mild successes include a pleasing duet with Feist called \\"And You and I\\" and a much-needed statement of conviction, \\"I'll Fight.\\" Let's hope there's a little more fight in Wilco next time around.

0307454541|5.0|This is the beginning of one of the best book series ever written. The introduction of characters is endless, constantly keeping you unaware of the next turn of events. If you are one to try and figure out the story line, like I am, you will be constantly surprised. Never-ending, suspenseful page turner. I couldn't put it down. It is easy to paint yourself into the book and adopt the characters as your own. Lisbeth will grip you in the most unconditional way. You might as well plan to read the entire series in a row as you simply cannot read only the first book.
B001E45XT4|1.0|I bought this item for an online distance learning course that required a headset.      I returned it for a replacement because the microphone didn't work.  The microphone on the replacement didn't work either.  I tried toggling the mute switch and tried to the headset on three separate computers (2 Mac and 1 PC) - none of the computers could detect any sound from the microphone regardless of which way the mute switch was switched.  I am now returning the second one for a refund because I am convinced that there is a manufacturing problem.      It's a shame that the product didn't work because the headset felt pretty comfortable (though I didn't try it for a long period of time) and the headphones sounded decent (nothing too great, but for an item like this definitely acceptable).      Fortunately, Amazon.com has been great with the returns.  I would just avoid this product to be safe and buy a headset from a different manufacturer.

B001IF252M|3.0|This item seems to have limited color depth. It looks like 16 bit color rather than 24 bit or Hi Color. It works fine for static display of the desktop and applications, but falls on its face when displaying continuous tone still images or video. Videos are heavily artifacted with obvious color bands and blocked up areas of shifted color due to video DAC quantization error. My application required connection of an XGA projector with a VGA analog input (15 pin) connection to a MacBook. Results were minimally acceptable for video. The same projector works fine with a PC notebook that has a native VGA connector built in. Photographers and videographers should pass up this item. I got the Apple product due to reliability concerns with third party vendors. I hope Apple lives up to my expectations for reliability. I haven't tried the firmware update that has been mentioned in other posts, but this was purchased directly from an Apple store just last month.  The update shouldn't be needed unless I got old stock.  Anyway, I am only asking for XGA resolution which should be pretty easy to accomplish.  It could be that there are some settings that I don't know about.  Can anyone advise?
B000002MFQ|4.0|At the time of its release in 1992, Mike Oldfield suggested that this album could be considered the first ever music sequel.  The word sequel is a  loaded one, connoting Hollywood's particular brand of cynicism  along with an implied lack of originality and creativity.  But sequel is a good word to describe Tubular Bells 2.  It takes the  overall structure of 1973's Tubular Bells and uses it as a template to construct a new album whose melodies are related - at times very closely - to those of the original. It is a interesting idea and perhaps the only time it has ever been attempted. The album doesn't feel like an exercise in cynicism - not in the way later sequels, remakes and rebrandings would.  It comes across as a genuine experiment, one undertaken with real enthusiasm,  although in titling it Tubular Bells 2, Oldfield was certainly guaranteeing himself more publicity and greater sales than he had been experiencing in the years prior to 1992.       So strongly is Tubular Bells 2 a sequel to Tubular Bells that it is almost impossible to regard it as a standalone album - by using the original as a constant referencing point Tubular Bells 2  forces one to examine it in light of its predecessor. So how does it hold up against its beloved parent record? Well, for a start it's a much lighter, sweeter album than Tubular Bells. Mike's dark emotional state during the creation and recording of Tubular Bells is well documented. By 1992, he had left Virgin, a company he felt had little interest in his work. He was signed to a new label and his new found positivity comes through on this record clearly.  But the emotionality of the original is not often present on Tubular Bells 2. Some of this lies in the production, courtesy of Trevor Horn, who helped give this album a thickly reverberant and very processed sound which at times feels antiseptic.  The dark and often harsh sounds of the original's organs  and keyboards have here been replaced by synthesizer patches, sequenced guitars and wordless human voices which function as pad sounds - thoroughly inoffensive but rather dull.  Anything hard, sharp or abrasive has been carefully filled down and rounded off and the album suffers for this. The rawness and dirtiness of the original gave it an immediacy which is part of the reason why it spoke ( and continues to speak) to so many people.       Tubular Bells 2 is organised into discrete tracks, although they flow into each other, effectively arranging the album into a \\"Side One\\"  and a Side Two\\".  At its best, the album's production becomes an asset. In Weightless , which opens  \\"Side Two\\", there are lots of small sounds rolling around, all beautifully placed in the mix; the voices are unobtrusive and the sequenced guitars bring a clean hypnotic quality. Sentinel achieves a similar effect, channeling the famous opening piano motif of Tubular Bells very nicely. Then there are sparse sections such as Blue Saloon,  where Tubular Bells 2 captures some of the more sinister qualities of the original. And Mike can still turn an exquisitely pretty melody, as he does in Great Plain, which uses mandolins and a banjo to wonderful effect. After two minutes the track becomes a bouncy and sequenced variation of itself which has its own charms, although such moments tend to use synthesizer patches which hold the album firmly in the year of its creation.      Unfortunately the Bell, the climactic section of  what is effectively \\"Side one\\",  is nowhere near as good as the corresponding part of the original. The build up to the main melody is far shorter, to the point of feeling cursory, and the melody itself is not nearly as memorable.  Alan Rickman, as the Master of Ceremonies, is theatrical without being melodramatic, but the whole section is played too much for comedy (\\"Two Slightly Sampled Electric Guitars\\") which strains repeated listening.  In  \\"Side Two\\" we have Altered state, the low point of the album. The drums are pedestrian, both in executionand in sound. The female voices are horribly unfunny, pulling you out of the listening experience,  and the Piltdown man who was so distinctive in Tubular Bells, here sounds like a bad Chewbacca impersonator.  It's a shame, because when the voices are silent, the track improves greatly, with some wonderful guitar work from Mike.      Overall, it's an interesting album, only partly successful. Later Mike would create more sequels to Tubular Bells. He would re-record it, re-mix it and use it's famous twisted bell as a logo on dubious projects such as The Millennium Bell, and in some of these cases the charge of cynicism is much harder to rebut.  But Tubular Bells 2 is a good album - not great - it's anodyne production alone would  keep it away from any claims to greatness. But it is genuine, often beautiful, far from cynical and certainly qualifies as an essential album for a Mike Oldfield fan.

She bragged constantly about her children while stating to do so openly was not highly regarded in her culture.     She talks about being \\"humbled\\" but there is no humility to be found. If you want to find her mocking \\"westerners\\" and making broad generalizations about how asians are smarter than anyone else, you'll find it easily.    She will tell you, for instance waiting for an audition at Julliard, she and her daughter LULU are waiting: \\"There were many, many Asians in the room\\" Yeah, Yeah we get it, westerners suck.     I am sure her children are talented. The money for private lessons, contacts in the academic world, and six hour \\"blood bath practice session\\" as she describes them, may have helped just a bit? Prodigies? Really?    There was some glimmer of hope toward the end, but then she shows us she really has not learned anything, and emotional intelligence on her part is non-exsistant.

0439023513|4.0|I read the first two books of the Hunger Games trilogy in December, but I didn't get my hands on \\"Mockingjay\\" until a few days ago.  It didn't take me long to become fully immersed once more in the dramas and traumas of Katniss Everdeen.  The novel opens with Katniss and many of her friends, family, and neighbors living in relative safety in the mysterious District 13.  The citizens of District 13 are plotting to aid the other districts in their rebellion against the cruel Capitol, and they're looking to Katniss to be the inspirational face of the movement.  Driven by thoughts of her dear friend Peeta, who was taken into Capitol custody after the last Hunger Games, Katniss reluctantly agrees.<br /><br />The Hunger Games trilogy was an ambitious project from the beginning, combining classical history (many aspects of ancient Roman society, including the gladiatorial contests), classical mythology (Theseus and the Minotaur), modern literature (Shirley Jackson's \\"The Lottery\\"), modern pop culture (\\"Survivor\\" and other reality competition shows), and current events (wars and rumors of wars).  \\"Mockingjay\\" brings it to a triumphant and satisfying conclusion.  More than ever, Collins refuses to gloss over moral ambiguities.  There are innocuous ordinary people on the Capitol side, people whose only crime was never questioning a cruel status quo; likewise, the rebels are just as often motivated by hatred and vengeance, the lust for power, or simple excitement, as by the ideals of freedom and justice.  The lines between necessary acts of wartime violence and simply unconscionable atrocity are far less clear than anyone would like them to be.  Collins isn't arguing for pacifism; clearly the Capitol needed to be overthrown, and there was no way it was going to happen without bloodshed.  At the same time, she doesn't hesitate to put a human face on \\"collateral damage.\\"<br /><br />In a book full of gory deaths and heroic acts of self-sacrifice, what really stands out is the cost that violence exacts from those who participate in it.  After rebel forces trigger an avalanche that destroys a cavernous military complex built into a mountain, Katniss finds herself thinking of her father who died in a mining accident, and dazedly brushing her hand along a marble wall: \\"there is no give to the surface - only my flesh yields, my warmth taken.  Stone conquers people every time.\\"  Later, Peeta, deranged from the Capitol's tortures and kept strapped to a bed for weeks, refuses to let Katniss remove his handcuffs even during one of his more lucid moments: \\"They help hold me together. . . .

Katniss, and at least some among those of her friends who survived the war, may find a measure of happiness in the end, but the scars will never fade away entirely.

0553381695|1.0|There is something about Mr Martin's writing style that I liked, though I was not quite happy with several of the stories in the first book. After reading the second book, I still feel he writes well, but found this book even more depressing and distasteful than the first. I'm stopping here. There is no one to root for as you never know who is going to be killed off next. Most of the remaining characters are not likable or that interesting.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele's deft voice, at once, possesses a gospel artist's power, a country singer's vulnerability, a rocker's edge, and a rhythm and blues artist's nuanced phrasing.  Always soulful, she straddles these genres to produce a vibrant dexterous sound all her own.      On [[ASIN:B004EBT5CU 21]], Adele, with no fear, also straddles the line between love and heartbreak as these 12 tracks, her sophomore effort at the tender age of 21, bring into sharp relief an amazing vocal talent that so clearly surpasses most of today's young singers.      In fact, on [[ASIN:B004EBT5CU 21]], Adele so skillfully, so perceptively, layers love and heartbreak that, through song, she presents for reflection this enigma: neither can be felt without experiencing the other.  Adele's seemingly effortless expressiveness is ready-made for such songs of depth, and here she distinguishes herself by voicing the raw conflicting emotions that imbue meaningful complicated relationships.    My favorites tracks are \\"Take it All,\\" \\"Rolling in the Deep,\\" \\"Someone Like You,\\" \\"Love Song,\\" and \\"One and Only.\\" The mood ranges from heart-pounding, foot-stomping, four-on-the-floor grooves to songs of stripped-down beauty.  Incisive lyrics effortlessly evoke elusive resilience here, an ephemeral defiance there. Some underly passion, revenge, anger.  Others invoke hope, tenderness, tranquility.     In short, if these songs do not move you...well...I don't even know how to finish that sentence.  They will move you!
B001UW58YU|5.0|The production quality on this Blu-Ray is exceptional. The Video Quality is simply stunning and superb in full HD. It immerses you even more into the atmosphere of the concert. The Audio Quality is also terrific and truly worth the purchase. The music is never drowned by the audience, the praise and clappings at the end of songs are well levelled and not overwhelming.    The blu-ray starts off impressively with the vocals and music peaking perfectly in line with Josh's appearance on stage along with the lights and visual effects.  The blu-ray catches the atmosphere of the concert perfectly with just the right level of audience shots and participation and the viewer gets a drift of being there live. The transition between songs are well-done and does not skip a beat, although by other reviewers that were there live, the blu-ray is shorter and missing more audience interaction. However, the average viewer of this blu-ray will not notice any part missing and it flows as though it's fluid and organic (never truncated).    The encore performances are a blast, and the blu-ray ends with a mighty rendition of the song 'Awake', which at the moment has become my number one Josh Groban song.  I do not have a 5.1 setup and relied only on stereo and pcm through my lcd tv, however the audio was still majestic and inspiring. I can only imagine the greatness with a full 5.1 setup.    Although the concert itself had songs that I am unfamiliar with, I find them to be a fair mix of popular and unique songs that blends in well throughout. The only drawback personally was that the song Canto Alla Vita was not a duet with The Corrs which would have been a great bonus considering there are other musical talents taking the stage in this concert.    Currently, I find myself replaying my favourite songs one-by-one. All songs were sung perfectly by Josh Groban given the live setting it is truly a masterpiece of a production and show. Highly recommended even for non-fans
B004BBDHEK|4.0|This was a most welcome CD.  I've been waiting years for Yanni to do his own thing again.  I was disappointed to hear two tracks from the \\"VOICES\\" that I really don't like.  I prefer his instrumentals.  However, the other 80% is excellent, pure Yanni.

B000GIWRIY|4.0|Released in 1995, this is Jethro Tull's 19th studio album (not including Living in the Past which was a compilation).  It is 60 minutes long.  The sound quality of the original was pretty good, so I am not sure what could be improved in this \\"remastered\\" version.    Many regard this album as the best Tull album since the 1970s.   I agree that it is certainly one of the better ones...which isn't that hard since many of them were not very good.      But, is this great?  While there is nothing really bad on the album and most of it is pretty good, there is nothing memorable or stand out about it.  I just played it twice in a row and I still can't remember a song on it....well, not quite true.  The thing is that even though the many of the previous Jethro Tull albums were not spectactular, they still had one or two great, memorable songs.    I think that some of the songs on the CD are still a little bit choppy, featuring a few seconds of a musical interlude and then jumping to something else.  Anderson started toying with the musical style in A Passion Play but really did not fully get into it until Crest of A Knave.  It can take a beautiful song (like he used to write in the beginning of his career) and turn it into something that is not as pleasant to listen to.    Of interest is Wounded, Old and Treacherous, which sounds like Frank Zappa's Montans and Stuck in the August Rain that sounds like something the Dire Straits would do.    This is one Jethro Tull album that I will keep, because I like nearly every song on it. For most every other CD since Thick As a Brick, there have not been enough good songs to keep the whole CD.  I have been ripping the tracks I like and have been putting the CDs in the pile to get rid of.    I have always been a fan of Jethro Tull (but not some albums) and have seen the group every time they are in the area.  They nearly always put on a great live show (except the album Live at the Hammersmith).  One of the first great concerts I saw was the Thick As a Brick tour.  They played Thick as a Brick for one hour and 20 minutes, and then for their next number, they did Wind Up wrapped around Locomotive Breath.  It was much better rendition of Locomotive Breath than I have ever hear again.
B00406UK7S|4.0|This film received absolutely no promotion of which I am aware. In fact, I only heard of it from previews attached to other DVD's, which looked interesting, so I ordered it from Netflix. I was very pleasantly surprised.....it was excellent, an easy 4 stars.    The entire movie was filmed on locations in Scotland that alternated between breathtaking beauty and bleak desolation, and were a completely accurate setting for the story. The plot centers around a mythical 9th Roman Legion which supposedly marched into the wilderness of Britain to subjugate the Picts, a wild, indigenous group of \\"barbarians\\", and were never heard of again. The plot of the movie is entirely fictitious, created by writer-director Neil Marshall to explain the disappearance, and he succeeds beautifully with an intricate and fascinating story providing non-stop action centering around several key figures on both sides.    Dominic West, portraying a fierce Roman general, is the male standout, and the magnificent Olga Kurylenko as a mute and supernaturally competent Pict tracker is riveting. Michael Fassbender, the \\"hero\\" is excellent, but somewhat understated in comparison. His ability to survive repeated harrowing and potentially lethal encounters is the backbone of the movie, and is impressive without seeming too contrived.    The action scenes are suitably gory, with decapitations and blood spray worthy of Spartacus Blood and Sand, and in an unusual concession to reality, people who get injured....stay injured, and do not magically appear in perfect health in the next scene. When frail Olga's character destroys big, powerful men in hand-to-hand combat, it does strain credibility just a bit, but I have come to appreciate strong female action characters far more than the boring old convention that women in action and horror movies are present simply to be helpless, saved by men, and to scream a lot.    In conclusion, speaking as a fan of this genre, with fairly high standards and absolutely no patience for mundane garbage, I highly recommend this movie. It is well conceived, beautifully photographed, skillfully acted, fast paced, and very, very entertaining.
B0036TGSR6|1.0|I have to admit I actually felt ashamed I watched the movie until the end.  The movie insults intelligence of a viewer by piling up cliches that were tiresome when we heard them over five years ago.  The plot is naive to the extreme: a weak ghost writer outsmarts  team of professional CIA agents and heads of governments and all what it takes him are three days of drinking and some Google searching.  Finally, the movie caters to worst category of conspiracy theorists.  Polanski for one should have known better.
0439023521|4.0|Winning is the only thing. In The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins, this cliché is never more vivid. Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Malark will find out what this means when their names are chosen to compete in the games. When reading the book, the reader can identify and connect with the main characters. Peeta is the son of a baker, and is very strong, but he lacks the hunting skills of Katniss.  Katniss who is the oldest of the two is an excellent hunter. Everything she knows about hunting she learned from her dad, who died when she was 11, leaving her to learn how to fend for herself ever since. Twenty four contestants are chosen to represent each of the 12 districts. Katniss and Peeta are from District 12. They must all fight to the death, determining which district will survive.    I would recommend this book to anyone who loves competition and suspense. The book kept me turning the pages, wanting to know what was coming next. The author is great at not giving away the ending, and I could never have guessed what was coming next. Fifteen year old kids fighting to the death to save their friends and families is an unexpected and disturbing plot line, but the author gives precise detail so you will not want to put the book down. It keeps you on the edge throughout the entire book, wanting to know who will die, and who will survive. Suzanne Collins wrote the book in such a way that the reader feels they are right there in the violent struggle of the games.

But, this device doesn't stay in my iPhone when I have it in the car. The clasp is really for previous models of iPhone/iPod and will not secure into the iPhone 4 well. If I pick up the iPhone, the DockStubz(and cable) falls out. (And I have the Otterbox Defender case - so it is not the case causing the issue. So, I don't use the DoskStubz unless I need to charge the phone.
B002Q9VPFM|5.0|In \\"Watchmen -the ultimate cut\\" it's the actual film & it flows so much more appropriately than did the theatrical cut. Even some of the dialogue & references are much more cohesive especially to the non Watchmen fan. With the inclusion of the animated short, \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\" woven into the film, its absolutely one of the best, ambitious, & original films of 2009. It's better than perfection.

B004DTLK8A|4.0|\\"Elysium\\" is the 13th brand new studio album by Finnish power metal band \\"Stratovarius\\" and the second to feature guitarist Matias Kupiainen replacing founder Timmo Tolkki. Although the cover references directly the artistic vision of the previous album \\"Polaris\\" (with the starship having landed), the album follows a somewhat different musical approach than the established power metal sound of `Stratovarius'.  Specifically the tempo has been dropped considerably from the speeding rhythm of \\"Polaris\\" to a more standard tempo, with the band clearly prioritizing choruses and melodies over speed. There is also evidence of a minor shift toward a neoclassical sound referencing to a small extent the band's early 90's style.<br /><br />The guitarist's contribution is once again key, having co-written six out of nine overall songs on the album; It would be fair to say that the newcomer Kupiainen and singer Timmo Kotipelto have developed into the main songwriters of \\"Stratovarius\\" being their collective effort that brought most of the songs on \\"Elysium\\".  Jens Johansson also contributes two songs he wrote single handedly.<br /><br />One has to also mention that the drop in speed makes most of the material on \\"Elysium\\" dramatic and more passionate than expected, with standouts \\"Infernal Maze\\", \\"Lifetime in a moment\\" and \\"Move the mountain\\".  Overall the new direction is probably refreshing to the melodic metal style of \\"Stratovarius\\" as it once again brings to front memorable tunes, although \\"Elysium\\" should have featured more than nine songs.
B001KEHAI0|4.0|Having seen this movie with what it seems like 1000's of times, it has FINALLY found its way into our collection. Although I did not see it in theaters, I hardly ever passed up the opportunity to see it on television. I may have rented it once or twice way back in the past, before Blockbuster and Hollywood ever made it big, but somehow never purchased it. And now, as it somehow was planned through network cable, it aired right before \\"Groundhog Day\\" this year, so I purposely ordered it on Groundhog Day, to make this special purchase seem more memorable. Now, having the full-length movie to scrutinize all of the scenes for new material, I cannot distinctively see where there were any missing parts not already seen in the aired version. Somewhat disappointing, though it leaves me with more of a sense of respect for the networks since they allow the full content to be ran. A great family movie with a real zinger of a twist revealing the details of humanity, which might leave society with some great moral lessons that each and every one of us may learn from.
B003IY47JK|4.0|I'm not a Metal person, in the sense that I don't usually listen to Metal music.  This doesn't sound like Metal to me.  When I think of Metal I think of screaming and crazy head bangers.  This music isn't like that.  It's not crazy.  It's nice and it makes me feel relaxed and calm.

Giving it 4 stars as a couple of the songs appear to be filler material and should not have made the cut.
B003UESJF6|5.0|For someone who is not yet in their tweens, this is a 5 star movie. For adults it is a 3 star movie. Megamind and Metro Man both are hurled to the earth from dying planets. Metro Man bumps out Megamind from a good home and lands our blue \\"hero\\" in prison. Megamind believes he is destined to be the villain his whole life, so he acts the role and harasses Metro Man, an unlikeable egotistical good guy as well as Metro City. After he successfully kills Metro Man and wins, his life is boring without a challenge so he creates a hero to fight himself, Titan Man.<br /><br />At this point I won't ruin the plot twists. Classic Rock and Pop is used as theme songs for the bad guy which made the movie confusing for me. ;)The sound track was 5 stars. What was unfortunate was the actors they chose to read the lines. They added nothing to the movie. When Lithgow, Murphy, and Diaz do a movie, their voices add to the story. This was not the case with Ferrell, Fey, Hill, Cross and Pitt. Could you imagine Eddie Murphy instead of Ferrell? Simply a better movie.
0385341679|3.0|Having waited over a year in between books 4 and 5, i was waiting with baited breath until I got my hands on this book.  There were some fulfilling moments but all in all I think there was alot of filler and repeated story points.  There were still many loose ends or stories wrapped up neatly just to wrap them up.  I was definately disappointed.  I think it wouldn't have been such a disappointment if I hadn't waited so long between books but it just didn't hold up after so long.  I'm sure I will check out Ms. Moning again when she has some new material but this series will go to good will along with her Highlander series.  Entertaining in the moment but mostly forgettable.

The calculator has more functions than I will ever use. However, as a Financial Advisor, the amortization function, interest rate calculations and bond calculations are all very helpful.

I feel it could have been better written.
0307454541|1.0|If you do not like violence--particularly against women, but, also, against all people and animals, DO NOT waste your money on this trash. I read widely, I believe strongly in intellectual freedom, but, given all of that, I found this a waste of my time. Only a couple of the men supposedly emerge positively, but depending upon your values, no one does. Sick and sad.<br /><br />The only positive is that the author builds suspense well. Frankly, after finishing this novel, I put it into recycling directly--and I mean the trash recycling. I could not think of any relative or friend who deserved its negativity. I had ordered another of the series, and I put that right into the recycling trash without reading it. I challenge this author to write something that improves our global society!
1576754227|3.0|A few weeks ago I was on the website [...]. I left a comment on an article about procrastinating and I won a copy of Eat That Frog! The title of the book comes from something Mark Twain once said about if the first thing you do everyday is eat a frog chances are that will be the worst thing to happen to you all day. The frog represents your biggest, most important task of the day.    Eat That Frog will help you learn how to identify and prioritize you tasks. It also gives you methods to get organized and to get into the habit of eating your frog so you can get more done in less time.    As someone who tends to procrastinate, it's usually June or July before I get around to making my New Years resolution. I was happy when this book arrived in the mail. Reading this book was a frog that I devoured in just a few days. Most of the ideas and techniques are common sense and I'm sure will be very useful. I think that anyone who follows the advice in this book will definitely improve at getting more done in less time and find themselves procrastinating less.    Will I use what I've learned from this book? I sure will, one of these days.
B002QY1F02|5.0|The people who rated this album low are close minded in my opinion. Jerry Cantrell wrote almost all of AIC's material over the years including the early years. I myself loved Layne Staley and he and Jerry were magic together. With this new album I think they knocked it out of the park. If you listen to it a few times and don't like it then you are just stuck in the past and can't accept change. I have been a huge AIC fan for a very long time and I absolutely love this. My wife and I had the great pleasure of seeing them twice on this tour and really loved every minute of it. Do yourself a favor and put this record on,crank it up and appreciate the wonderful sound of it. Rock on AIC. I can't wait for the next one!!!
B002UXRGM0|5.0|Forget the \\"other\\" version.  This one won't make you cringe or put you to sleep.  This film is wonderfully done and thoroughly infused with Sir David Attenborough's infectious love for his craft and his lifelong pursuit of uncovering some of nature's best-kept secrets.  Having watched most, if not all, of Attenborough's nature series over the decades, I could not imagine watching this film listening to someone else's narration of its content.  C'mon, the man virtually invented the genre.  Maybe some people at Discovery thought Americans were sub par to their Brit counterparts when it came to understanding or appreciating the Queen's language--or Americans have become so special they deserve their own version--whatever.  Anyhoo, another homerun.  Kudos, BBC!
B0001Z37HM|5.0|Red Sonja is one of the best barbarian movies from the 1980's, along with \\"Conan the Barbarian\\", and \\"The Beastmaster\\". Brigitte Nielsen does fantastic in her role portraying a tough barbarian woman that sets out to triumph evil. The movie is well filmed, and holds up well through the years with a fantastic fantasy musical score that sets the mood. Arnold Schwarzenegger makes a brilliant appearance as Kalidor the lone barbarian warrior who sets out to aid Sonja on her mission. The action is well balanced, the characters are great, and the movie contains a cool story that transports you to the ancient medieval times. I recommend this movie wholeheartedly to all fantasy fans, and people that enjoy Dungeons and Dragons type movies.
1590600754|3.0|Luckily, this book was for my son because I never could have read it with my allergies. It was in good physical condition, but the musty, moldy, dusty smell was overwhelming. Yuck. Since he doesn't have my allergy problems, my son didn't mind.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I'm SO pleased to have met this author! It could be that his isn't a voice and style that works for everyone, but if given a chance there's a big payoff waiting. I started with The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet, a more traditionally structured book, and a great story. The Cloud Atlas is not a conventional format, but what a joy to read. When I reached the last page I was almost sorry to have it end and wished the book were twice as long. Have read all others available on Kindle, Number 9 Dream was the best of those. But the first two were just outstanding and highly recommended.
0385340540|2.0|I've read all of Grisham's books and enjoyed some more than others. On several occasions while reading the Broker, I stopped to think, sheesh, this book is more about Italy's buildings and restaurants. Not that this is a bad thing, it's just not what I expected.  My second complaint is the characterization. Backman is a slimy, greedy lawyer, and while six years in jail apparently reforms him, it doesn't reform him enough where he'll actually apologize to his son. I was hoping right to the end of the book, but sadly, Backman's greatest concern, is to leave the country and look up his Italian woman.  Despite having given his son nothing all these years, the son still found it in himself to help him. Not a good thing when you don't like your main character.  It seemed to me Grisham decided he wanted to write a book about Italy and the story was secondary in his considerations.  I don't care about spending $12 on this book, but I need to go find me a GOOD book to get this one out of my system.
0061537969|3.0|In this book, the dog is the chief narrator and commentator.  He has learned a number of things while watching TV all these years, as well as watching people.  He learned about reincarnation on TV and is all in, thinking himself ready to return as a person.  He cannot make himself understood to people, owing to the shape of his tongue, so what is a dog to do but write a book?    Concerning the title, the protagonist is a car racer.  The author includes quite a lot about racing, both history and technique.  I think the book could have survived nicely with about half as much.  The rest of the plot line is so formulaic that it makes your eyes roll.   The question is not what will happen next but rather how it will be phrased.    So you don't really read to see the plot unfold (that's pretty clear by about page 20).  You don't read on to be impressed by the author's awesome grasp of racing, unless you're some kind of fanatic.  The reason to read on is that periodically, the dog has something really interesting to say.  His observations about how people really are, about relationship dynamics, and the world, are worth the more mundane parts of the effort, although it should be noted that the dog is brilliant only three or four times in the course of the standard 300-page book.    This book is enjoying some commercial success.  I have heard it called a great book.  It isn't, it's way too light for that.  But it is a good book.
1416550534|4.0|I read Kate Morton's The Forgotten Garden and it was so good, I simply had to read the first book she wrote, The House at Riverton. I was not disappointed. It took me about 100 pages to really feel pulled into the story but that's not uncommon with large tales that span a lifetime. A 90 year old woman's memories just prior to her death, span her servitude from the age of 14 to approximately 28, to the aristocratic family living at the house of Riverton. The story shows the incredible sense of duty and loyalty servants were bred to give their masters/mistresses and their children. It's a tragedy set in a socio-historical period when women weren't encouraged to read, have opinions or be intelligent. Repressed emotion and unfulfilled dreams were the order of the day. One could say this period of history around WWI was the antithesis to self-actualization. What a sad state of affairs. I have to say the most fascinating aspect of this novel was the period in which it was set. Morton paints a picture of what life was like for the servants and the leisure class, revealing both to have unfulfilled lives based on society's rigid expectations. Aristocracy was all about safe-guarding the family name and inheritance, while servants were to act like shadows to those they waited upon, guessing their every need while denying their own. Who can be happy in that picture? You guessed it. The stage is set for tragedy upon tragedy. I found I did not care for the characters the way I wanted to. The hero of the novel, for me, turned out to be Alfred, a soldier returned from war who has the courage to break free from servitude and build a life of his own. The women were sad products of their time, struggling to live true to their needs, desires and dreams, but not quite getting there. I would say Grace moved on solely by virtue of circumstance, not inner resolve. My other criticism is the character of Frederick is most annoying. We never quite understand why he is so silly with his children. Not talking to them because he didn't care for their decisions only rendered him selfish in my eyes. Moping about the grounds day after day almost turned him into a sort of comedic character who I hoped would just go away. It was impossible for me to feel empathy for him. Sure he was in his late brother's shadow and his business failed. I guess the moral of that story is, he who has no freedom to be who he is, cultivates no inner resources?     However, overall, the story is magnificently told, and if you read The Forgotten Garden, you will see in both books, Kate Morton is a fabulous writer. Nuances dot her story lines as she mirrors Grace's motivations and choices to that of Hannah's, and the house at Riverton's deterioration and later false portrayal through tourism, to society's desolation and then drunken gaiety after WWI. I couldn't put the book down. And I thought about it afterwards. That's always a very good sign. I also hope this becomes a movie. More than once, I felt very thankful for being a woman in 2010 !!
B004HGBUVG|5.0|This is truly a masterful record that reveals itself more with each listen. She is singing better than she ever has, and the band's playing is inspired and right with her. As one critic somwhere put it -I don't know what this album is missing.  From the not gonna be knocked down swagger of the opener Buttercup, the harsh truth of Copenhagen, the vitriol of Seeing Black to the power of the Awakening with its Doors-ish tone and snarling guitars, this record is about survivial.  For all the records that are written about getting knocked down, this one is about gettting back up and standing strong.  Coming from someone who has been knocked down more than her share of times, and someone who always gets back up-i'll just say amen girl.
B00000ADG2|5.0|I'm writing this review years after Miseducation came out but I felt inspired to share what Lauryn Hill's album did for my sons and I as we listened to it over and over again.  She not only has an incredible voice, but she is a singer who sings about important things.  Perfection is reached when gifted musicality and intelligence come together.  All of her songs will make you feel something because they are so clearly from her heart.  Every lyric is believable and her delivery is ridiculous it's so good.  Rumor she's coming back to the studio after twelve years which makes me very very happy.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|This album gives me hope for the music scene. It's full of well played music with substance. I love it. Their also going to be at Wakarusa 2011 in Arkansas. I'm making the trek from the tip of the east coast! The line up is incredible!!! Can't wait to see these guys there!
1416550550|4.0|This is a magnificent story, although its tragedies are very sad. Morton writes of a time in England where impoverished people were driven to drastic survivalistic measures such as selling their children (Adeline). The indelible effects of cold and cruel parents, have long lasting effects (Linus), and ignorance in the medical field left people permanently marred (Rose). A lineage of three orphaned children, Eliza, Nell and Cassandra. Eliza fairs the worst. While Nell has a traumatic incident in her fourth year, the love she finds with her new family, helps her form into a strong woman. And Cassandra feels unwanted and neglected until Nell raises her.     There were parts in the story which I found hard to fathom, for example, Nell's complete rejection of a family who loved her for 17 years, or Eliza's need to get the brooch/hierloom at the end of the story, when she had ample time to get it during her earlier forays. Still, it's an amazing story and Morton's writing is just gorgeous. Her poetic descriptors like \\"branches scribbled across the horizon\\" were so pretty.     This book is hard to put down. And I could see this film made into a movie
B000001XNT|5.0|Verdi's \\"Il Trovatore\\" was the very first opera that I was introduced to by a very dear friend of mine, way back into the early 60's. I wasn't into opera at that time and he said he would convert me and after heariing hearing Il Trovatore I was hooked and I couldn't get enough of it. My next set was Wagner's Siegfried,(eventually the rest of the Ring) do you mind. I was off into the deep end no turning back now!<br />I had never know of a French version before now, so I tracked it down to an Italian version with the French ending.<br />The variation in the endings is as follows: In the original Italian version; Manrico is beheaded by the axe and in the French version he is sent to the gallows. Verdi quite rightly realized that there was not enough music for the extra time required for this style of execution; as there are only 11 bars of music between the moment when Manrico is dragged away and the Conte says \\"E spento!\\" (He is Dead\\") this being enough time to kill someone by axe. But for the gallows, this required more time and music. So what he did to extend the sequence, was to revamp the \\"Miserere\\" from the preceding scene (Leonora and Monks: Part Four Scene One) as a trio for Manrico, the Conte and Azucena with the monks choir off in the distance. The reason for choosing this piece was because of its solemn \\"andante sostenuto\\" which contrasts with the previous allegro section, then concludes with the original final bars. This makes sense of the time line and has a much more dramatic conclusion to the opera. This when premiered at the Paris Opera was sung in French. Sadly there is no French version recorded to date other that this Italian translated one. I actually prefer this ending. The cast is exceptional as well: The great Dutch nightingale Cristina Deutekom is Leonora; Juan Lloveras is Manrico; Jan Derksen is Il Conte di Luna; Carolyne James is Azucina; Tom Haenen is Ferrando; Renee van Haarlem is Ines and Adriaan van Limpt is Ruiz with the Nederlands Operakoos and the Utrechts Symfonieorkest conducted by Christopher Keene on Gala (Live Recording). Good sound quality along with the obligatory Coughs and Splutters for good measures. Il Trovatore is the opera I use to introduce opera novices to the wonderful world of opera as is the only opera which has 26 hummable tunes in it.<br />If you love Verdi; if you love Il Trovatore; buy it and relive a magical opera.
B002ZG98UA|5.0|I got this for my Boyfriend for his birthday, and he LOVED it! He'd seen it at a friend's house, so he already knew he loved the movie...choosing a gift was a CINCH after that! The disc arrived in excellent condition, in its original casing with what we assumed to be all its papers, and even shrink/plastic-wrapped. The movie played perfectly without skipping, or showing any other problems...and it even got to my mailbox in a pretty timely manner! It's been a while since it arrived, but if I'm remembering rightly, it arrived slightly earlier than I expected...and it was well-packaged, too, for shipment. No damage, and the disc wasn't even loose in the case from jostling! (THAT can cause SERIOUS SCRATCHES, so I always worry about that when I purchase a dvd online.) All in all, the seller did a great job, and I hear the movie was \\"awesome,\\" so I'm MORE than satisfied with the purchase. As for my boyfriend...well, he says it made his birtday. [Yeah...no jealousy here, at ALL... ;) ]
B003ZHQVJO|3.0|I bought this CD because I heard the title song, Born Free, on country stations.  Turns out most of the songs are more soft rock.  It's OK but not really the type of country music I like.
B004EN9WCQ|5.0|Coming out at the same time as James Blake is maybe a little unfortunate for Nicholas Jaar. However, it's entirely possible that in a couple of years this will be the 'experimental' album of the 2011 that people will remember more.It doesn't have the radio friendly tracks like Blake's cover of 'Limit to your love' but it hangs together well as a whole and is the kind of album that you would describe as a 'grower'.
B003DF44ZQ|5.0|Even when this is a weird package (what have in common beside be fun?) the value for the package make them very cheap to be blu-ray and a lot more interesting that buy only 1 of them
B000MM0L2S|5.0|I am delighted with the CD supplied by Abe Books in Texas - but even happier with the speed with which they dealt with my order. I was told by Amazon by e-mail to expect delivery week commencing 7th March (ie today) but I actually received it on 25th February. Excellent service. Thanks. As far as the CD itself is concerned, I have never thought that anyone could better Ennio Morricone's own versions of his work - and having heard this CD, I still believe that. Nevertheless, Metallica's rendition of The Ecstasy of Gold comes pretty close.......
B003V9OCIS|5.0|This is truly a cliffhanger!  I could hardly watch the last 20 minutes of the movie - I could not handle the suspense.  If you've ever climbed this movie will leave you wanting more.
B0024FAR5M|3.0|Watched Season 1.  Right away, the premise seems unbelievable --- a few gang members running a town and being almost loved and highly respected by many of the townspeople (in California, no less!).  Of course, if such occurred, Charming would have few jobs, no outside investment, and a mass exodus of residents.      And, indeed, they do seem like fairly nice guys with lots of money and even a sense of civic responsibility.    Ride on a motorcycle your whole life and a road accident might do you in.  Join a small gang and you might survive if given a life sentence.      If they were truly powerful, an FBI agent would likely infiltrate and put the members in jail.           Finally, the casting seems wrong.  Good looking and strutting like a gangbanger, young Jax and many members do not look very tough and smart --- at least not to me.      I wonder what real bikers think of the show?  :-)
0670022411|5.0|I guess this is the kind if book you either love, or hate.  I was wary because of the bad reviews, but I really liked it!  Couldn't put it down, read it in 2 days.  I thought the plot was interesting and fun.  Maybe not the  best writing style, but very entertaining!  Give it a chance if you like easygoing fantasy and romance.
030746363X|5.0|My husband and I are doing the diet (for fat loss), and the perfect posterior workout.  We're only on day 9, but I've already lost 1 inch from my waist, and my husband has lost 1.5 inches.  I don't find it that hard to stick with- I almost enjoy eating this way now.  I went into this pretty skeptical, but hey- it seems to be working! Maybe it doesn't work for everyone, but it is working for us.  I almost skipped this buy because of all of the bad reviews claiming the good reviews couldn't possibly be real.  I'm glad I decided to ignore those.  So far the book has been very interesting and a fun read.  It's motivating and really is giving me the drive to \\"experiment\\" with myself until I find what works best for me.  If you're on the fence- just go for it!  It's worth the $15.
B00364K6YW|4.0|This is a classic movie from a class book, full of romance and with, and all of the actors make the work shine. Colin Firth's darcy is romantic and charming and well-rounded.
B0037AGASG|5.0|CD of Justin Bieber, My World 2.0, was the greatest surprise my grad daughter received in the mail.  It was perfectly in tact and on time.  Happy with this transaction and very grateful.
B0000AUHPK|4.0|This is a good version of \\"Wuthering Heights\\", full of the romance and passion that is in the book itself.  Laurence Olivier was suave and romantic in the role of Healthcliff in the old version of Heights; but I have to say I like Ralph Fiennes in the role better; he brings the edginess and spunk and rage to the Healthcliff role that Olivier romanticised a little too much.
B0014Z4ON4|1.0|I gave this movie a one star review only because there was not a zero star option.  I once loved life.  After seeing this thing I now hate life.  This can't even be called a movie.  I now know what it must be like to be consumed by The Nothing.  I would actually prefer such a fate rather than watch this movie again.
B001E45XT4|4.0|I'm very glad I decided to purchase this headset. I use it primarily for Skype calls and have spent around 20 hours one week with these on my ears. The sounds quality is great, both in my ears and through the microphone. They are mostly comfortable but could probably stand to be a little more. But for $25, not bad. I like how they cover my ears entirely but I can still hear if someone walks in and says something. Music sounds good on them, too. My only minor complaint is the volume wheel (with mute slider button), while a very nice feature, is a little hard to spin sometimes. Very minor problem, though. I would absolutely buy these again.
0517214660|5.0|The author is indeed a great master, who can plot this story in such a way that a reader feels that he has to finish this story as soon as possible.    Without such a story, the life in that time would be totally forgot. This is the real-life treasure for civilization.
1843106698|4.0|This is a very thorough, indeed 'complete' guide to Asperger's Syndrome. What is somewhat surprising to me, is how close it came in publishing to the DSM 5 [CORRECT, it is no longer a roman numeral!], and this 'Syndrome' now falls UNDER 299.00 \\"Autistic Disorder,\\" rather than lie outside of the spectrum. I think that the author perhaps was ahead of game--likely adding a great deal to the revised edition of the DSM. I just thought I should point this out, so as to somewhat 'update' those whom were not aware...<br /><br />This is not to say this book is out of date, however. I was simply surprised to see it was still #2 in most categories! WELL DONE! I'll keep this short as the other reviews do a splendid job in overviewing this well written and informed guide.
0670022411|5.0|I would like to update my feedback.  Contacted seller & they solved my problem.  I would like to give them 5 stars.  Thank you.

B003X5UDEW|5.0|I think this is the movie that has turned me into a martial arts fan. Amazing to watch. I think I might have enjoyed this movie even without the great plot because the martial arts scenes are just delectable candy for the eyes...
B0010Z32OA|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. I was lucky enough to see it in theaters when it first came out. I had been very excited to see the movie as I had read Neil Gaiman's book that this is based on years before and had loved it. I was not disappointed by this movie at all. In fact, although this might be a bit blasphemous to say, I think this is the only movie based on a book that I've watched, where I think I liked the movie adaptation more than the original.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I actually thought this was a better album than \\"19,\\" which won her two Grammys.  I really enjoyed the whole album and listened to it all in one sitting.  The feeling on the album is consistent from the first track, \\"Rolling in the Deep,\\" to the last one, \\"Someone Like You.\\"  With the names of the albums reflecting her age, I actually do hear a little more maturity in her work on this album.  I can't wait to see what she has to offer us in a decade.
B002N5N5M0|4.0|As usual, Dexter is compelling and entertaining in it's fourth season. The season's main plotline, featuring John Lithgow as a chilling and gripping antagonist, is excellent stuff. However, the season is a bit dragged down with some of the side plotlines. The Batista/LaGuerta plot in particular seems out of nowhere and pointless, as is some of the Dexter's new family stuff. The return of Keith Carradine was totally welcome, and overall I'd call this a strong season that managed to really pull me in spite of a few minor annoyances. If you're already 3 seasons in, pick it up! The 4th chapter won't disappoint you. If you're new to the series, start with season 1, this is a show where continuity matters.
1400079144|1.0|I've read all books of Dan Brown, but this one, if you had not read it already, don't bother. This is pure garbage. My opinion is writing this book was the only reason he wrote it. I'm so disappointed to the extent I feel sad.
1400032717|5.0|An Amazing Perspective   In the novel, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime, by Mark Haddon, an autistic boy named Christopher attempts to find the killer of his neighbor's beloved dog. Along the way, Christopher discovers that his previously dead mother was not dead at all. All during the time, Christopher is studying to be the first person to pass the level \\"A\\" math exam at his school. When he uncovers that his father had killed the dog, Christopher becomes afraid and untrusting, and sneaks away to try to find his mother. In the end, Christopher and his mother move back to where his father lives, and he passes his level \\"A\\" math exam.   I thoroughly enjoyed the book for two reasons; the plot was extremely intriguing, and the outlook of life in a different perspective amazed me. The plot entertained me, because it was the perfect mix of adventure and description. For example, when Christopher makes an effort to try and save his pet rat he jumps into the tunnel to pick up it up (Haddon, 182). Meanwhile, a train is pulling in to the station, and comes dangerously close to hitting Christopher. At the nick of time, man jumps down into the tunnel to pull him out. The excitement and the imagery of the incident created a vivid picture in my mind.    The narration in this book is completely different than any other book that I have ever read. In this book, the reader gets to experience the world through an autistic boy's perspective. It is amazing to see an outlook on life that I will never experience. Christopher notices many extra things in life that most people probably don't realize. For one, he notices every sign and every pattern there is. When his mother brings him pajamas, he takes great interest in the pattern (Haddon, 210-202). Christopher also notices all of the signs nearby.  For example, when he is in the train station hiding from the policeman, Christopher looks at every single sign to make sure he was in London (Haddon, 169-170). For me, the knowledge of seeing through an autistic boy's eyes is mind-blowing, and has changed my outlook on life.
B000C1YPY4|2.0|John Legend's voice is incredibly enjoyable to me and it shines on this album in SACD format.  Unfortunately so do all of the production shortcuts that were taken.    There is zero depth to the sound and no sound-stage reproduction.  The drums, bass, any brass, and in some songs, even the piano, sounds like they're coming out of my keyboard instead of my $5,000 dollars worth of audio equipment.  The terrible beats in most songs, paired with SACD quality of the voice recording make you feel like John is beside you singing along to that keyboard produced beat.  It's really an injustice.      That said, the song \\"Ordinary People\\" sounds great, because its just him and the piano.  The piano also sounds much better on that track than on most other songs... Maybe they had a real piano, or maybe they just payed more attention to this song during production.  The other song where the production wasn't terrible is \\"It Don't Have to Change.\\"  In this song he sings with a small choir and a piano.  It has a soul/Baptist feel to it that I really like.  The depth of the sound and clarity turned out well because there was no other instrumentation to it.    Aside from these two songs, the SACD version is a total loss on this album... It's sad really, because I love his music once in awhile.    Although most of the album was bad, I got the SACD for right around 10$ with shipping on amazon, so not too bad for two songs I really like.
B003L20ID8|5.0|Based very loosely on the short story by Phillip K. Dick's short start the Adjustment Team, Adjustment Bureau is on it's own pretty much after the first 25 minutes//story wise story wise. You may know Dick's hand in the sci-fi hits as the classic Blade Runner and the not so classic Total Recall. But what they do have in common with Bureau like most of Phillip K. Dick's work there's one big mindfrak after another. This is a timely release after the success of the equally trippy \\"Inception.\\" The premise of things not being what they seem mix with a unrequited and ill-fated romance that should never be, the romantic angle is where the short story stretches to feature length.  Matt Daemon's character learned the hard way that \\"Sometimes Being early is just as bad as being late.\\" David Norris, a would be US senator, president even, brought back from the brink of ending his political career by a speech  inspired by a woman, Elise (Emily Blunt),who encouraged him to be more honest, later he meets her again on a bus he was \\"fated\\" to miss, he then arrives to a meeting on time but he witnesses situational \\"fixers\\" in stylish hats no human was meant to see. This is explained to his as is that he must never see the girl again, nor tell of the Bureau's existence. He is also told that \\"the plan,\\" made by someone they refer to as \\"the Chairman\\" must be followed. They warn Norris if he tells anyone he will be \\"reset\\", a personality lobotomy. Norris spends the next three years riding the same bus before finding the woman again, and he must risk threats that the two will lose their dreams as well as overcome the strange suited forces working to keep them apart with the advise and aid of his own bureau guardian angel Harry Mitchell (Anthony Mackie).<br /><br />The report between Matt and Emily is as fun and solid, even believable, as that between Matt and Mackie, the other suit \\"antagonists have equally superb banter, especially Mr. Richardson (John Slattery) and Terrance Stamp as the Bureau's own Mr.Wolf-style fixer... The Hammer even. The movie may not answer any lofty questions about free-will, but it is a cool ride and leaves you with an uncanny fear of guys in hats.

B004MMEIK0|1.0|Here is one heroine that I couldn't wait to see killed off. This is really the only reason I kept reading, hoping that each page would take me closer to Shanna's death. This has to be one of the worst books I have ever read - its sloppy and not thought through, its corny..Shanna is corny, she's unlikable and annoying. The situations created are cheesy and droll, showing that no real creativity was placed into  anything. Ask any teenager at fanfiction.com to use these same characters and write a novel...the turn out will be much better.  The author's attempt at comedy fell flat, it was a train wreck. It's just horrible. I can't understand the high reviews and I believe those reviews are doing a great injustice to potential readers.
1439102724|5.0|I have to admit that I haven't loved all of Jodi's books - 'My Sister's Keeper' has always been my favorite, though. Until Now.    'Sing You Home' was a breath of fresh air, and could very well take a place in my list of Favorite Books of All Time. The points-of-view from Zoe, Vanessa and Max were all equally important, even if I did side with Zoe and Vanessa regarding the frozen embryos.    Even though the relationship between the two women moved from friendship to love very quickly, I had no doubt about the love they felt for each other. Bravo to Jodi for painting those beautiful images of love and acceptance with her words.    This is one that I will definitely be reading over and over again!
0307389839|3.0|My Sister-in-Law is a fan of Mr. Murakami's novels. For Christmas she decided to give me this book about running. Since I love running and love to read about my hobbies I gave it a shot. Truthfully, the book is more like reading a blog or diary of a runner. While it provided insight to the life of a writer and Mr. Murakami's growth as a writer, it did not provide much else. Unless you are a fan of his works I wouldn't expect much.
B004289ZW0|5.0|The GPS captured easily by the iPad Bluetooth and worked very well in my airplane using ForeFlight.  Plus, I didn't have to worry about it being attached to the USB pen at the base of the iPad as another GPS is.  That is a recipe for breakage and less quality signal inside the cockpit.  whereas this GPS just sits on the glareshield under the windshield.
6305428425|5.0|I would have to say it goes against all common sense to think this movie is great. BUT I DONT CARE!! This movie is awesome!! It had been 13 years since I had last seen it and I remembered it being hilarious and very out-there. I was hoping after all these years that I wouldn't be disappointed. And I wasn't in the least. In fact it was better than I remembered and I also discovered a new found liking for the comedy style of Jeneane Garofalo who plays Heather Mooney. Who is just great in this movie. Ramone is also a riot along with the Smoking Cowboy and of course Toby. People I didn't truely appreciate the first time around. Of course it's a corny movie but what the hell, GO FOR IT!! I did and I don't regret it one bit. Did I mention how great the soundtrack is?!
1600595871|5.0|As a nearly lifelong journal-er I have always appreciated papers and handmade books for both written and art journaling, but I can't say that I was ever tempted to make a book myself - before I saw this book that is! There are a lot books that claim to be 'complete' or 'compendiums' of techniques. To my way of thinking there are few books that actually live up to those merits. \\"Making Handmade Books\\" is one of those few titles that does not claim to be complete, replete or a compendium but succeeds in being all of that and more. No kidding! If you have ever been tempted ( or are even like me and didn't think that you were interested) to learn what making  a handmade book would entail - this is the book to read. Ms. Golden once again manages to fill the pages of this book with so much, very complete, information that if you could only have one book about making books - this would be the one to choose. Once again the contents as written by Ms. Golden on her website tell the story of how much is included in this book far better than I could write.

B00475AYJQ|4.0|Echoing what many have said, I waited for this book with baited breath and, while good, it has uneven pacing and at times dragged. Rothfuss has as lively an imagination as ever and an often wicked sense of humor, but this felt like a book that could have shed, particularly in the University-focused areas, at least a hundred pages. Of course, I read it in a day, thoroughly enjoyed it, and look avidly to the final(?) installment, but I doubt I'll be finding myself re-reading it like I have \\"The Name of the Wind.\\"

1439102724|1.0|Full disclosure - I'm a Picoult fan, however, this book doesn't measure up.  Take away the infertility saga and this is much like the actress Meredith Baxter's story.  I feel little investment in any of the characters and portions of the plot feel contrived (Zoe and Max walk away from 10 years of marriage without discussion or debate...the right wing conservative versus left wing liberal plot nuances are predictable). A disappointment...
B003L20ID8|4.0|What would life be like if a Bureau made sure our life's events followed a plan written by the \\"Chairman?\\" What makes this theme work is the fact that people do fear that our government has too much control over our free-will.    \\"The Adjustment Bureau\\" focuses around New York State senate candidate David Norris. After losing his early lead, on election night he rehearses his concession speech in a bathroom of which he believes to be empty. To his great surprise Elise Sallas is in the bathroom stall. Elise advises Norris to make the speech more original and honest. After discussing the speech they kiss for a brief moment before they are interrupted by one of Norris's advisors. Norris continues to give his speech which is received very well and starts him down the road of recovery from losing the election. Next, we see a mysterious man sitting on a bench where he is supposed to make sure Norris spills his coffee on himself, causing him to miss the bus. However, this mysterious man falls asleep on the job, so Norris gets on the bus and meets Elise once again. Before departing on their separate ways, Elise gives Norris her phone number. As Norris enters his office, he finds everyone is frozen in place and stubbles upon a group of mysterious men in black suits and hats. He attempts to flee from them but is eventually overtaken by them. He then awakes in a garage and is explained to that these mysterious men are called the Adjustment Bureau. They have a set plan that must be followed and that it says in the plan he must not see Elise anymore. They burn her phone number and tell him if he tells anyone about them, they will erase his memory, so he is left with the option of moving on with his live or pursuing Elise, who makes him feel like a complete man.    Both Matt Damon and Emily Blunt deliver wonderful performances and share an on-screen chemistry which carries the film past a weird, but interesting plot.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|Great movie, if you are a Jane Austen fan then a must have, a new version of Pride and Prejudice,  movie is not too short, and covers the entire book. Makes you feel as if were the person in the story.   Would recommend.
0307269752|4.0|After reading The Girl Who Kicked the Hornest's Nest I decided to read the trilogy Stieg Larrson wrote. I think anyone who enjoys reading mystery books will enjoy this author. I like the fact that it not only holds your interest but this is not a book you can read and watch TV at the same time. It has twists and turns that make you look forward to the next chapter. Since I am a fan of books that are a little more lengthy and thought provoking, this was a perfect winter read.
1577314808|5.0|Huge fan of this book!  This book has opened my mind to the power of the present moment.  It has played a major role in my recent shift in perception.  I will say that it can be a difficult read for skeptics or those who have trouble focusing, but its message was so powerful that it kept my attention from start to finish.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Warning--The first half is a bit slow, but once it picks up you better hold on! I loved the first book and couldn't wait until the second one. The book started out slow and I was disappointed. I kept reading and was very glad that I did!! The story kicked into high gear and I was hooked once again. I could not put the book down and I read it all that same day!

1934356557|5.0|I'm very familiar with procedural languages like Perl, but my knowledge of SQL is limited at best.  I can't speak for SQL experts, but this book was perfect for me.    It wasn't just a list of stupid SQL tricks; the author went into detail about the requirements and data layout leading to the poor SQL decisions, and then demonstrated better ones.    If there's a chance that you'll be asked to help lay out *any* type of data store, even a basic key-value one, this book is a good investment.
B0021L8V0M|2.0|Empty and boring.  Having a famous actress in the lead role does not save one from the boredom of the movie.  I guess since I gave Robin Hood two stars this one deserves the same.  Why not one star?  Believe or not, I have seen worse.
B00275EHJG|5.0|After the imaginative brilliance of \\"Up\\" (2009), Pixar concludes the \\"Toy Story\\" trilogy in equally memorable fashion. Woody, Buzz and the gang return for a colorful Oscar-winning adventure that manages to top its predecessors. Terrific family entertainment and a refreshing alternative to Hollywood's junk-food cinema.
B003U0AHBO|2.0|Trying to be original in the absence of originality.  A far fetched story that drags on.  Too bad Russell Crowe wastes his talent on junk like this--any further analysis of the movie would be a waste of my time.  If the story is empty it should at least be entertaining.  However, since I have seen worse movies than this one, I am giving it two stars.
B004KRQFI0|5.0|I LOLd at another review that said \\"It sounds like transformers humping on oxycontin\\", even now, just typing it again makes me laugh. This is an excellent album that a friend suggested to me when I asked for new music to listen to. It's just so awesome, I can't wait to hear more from Skrillex.
0784011710|5.0|Meryl Streep's performance has been so hyped over the years that I thought there was no way it could live up to the expectations I had set; for once the hype was totally correct.  As far as I'm concerned, there is Meryl Streep as Sophie, and then there's every other performance.  She is simply in a different league.  Everyone talks about the \\"choice,\\" which was riveting, but the real treat is watching a master of her craft take your breath away with every scene she's in (and she's in 95% of it).  Words just do not do justice to her performance, which has to go down as the greatest for an actress in history.  You simply cannot take your eyes off of her, and it almost seems super human the level of talent she brings:  It's not just the fluent German, Polish, and perfect broken English; it's the nuances she brings to the role.  I cannot say enough about it.  When Premiere magazine named this the third greatest performance in the history of cinema, they got it absolutely right (the highest female performance on the list).    The movie does have its flaws:  It's a bit slow in parts, and Kevin Kline and Peter McNichol's stories seem like tangents due to the absolute magnetism that Streep brings to the role.    I would imagine that this is required viewing for any acting class.
0399536108|4.0|What I found most inspiring about this book was that the author included the story of his life as an example of what is the premise of the book: setting your own rules, bending the existing rules, living the life you want and daring to do that, and changing the world on your own terms. What helped me was understanding that Chris is not extraordinarily courageous. He is just like the rest of us, with his own doubts and fears. Those of us who always sit back and say \\"Oh, but I could never do that, I don't have the guts,\\" should take heart that yes, they can do that, and it doesn't take a lot of guts, it just takes a different way of looking at the rules and at life. Are you living to follow everyone else's rules, or are you living to live the life you want? This book is a wake up call to those of us who tell ourselves we can't do something or believe others who tell us we can't.
0875845851|5.0|Why have many once market-leading companies failed to stay relevant? It would be easy to assume that they had stagnant engineers or complacent management, but Clayton Christensen concludes otherwise: \\"Because they carefully studied market trends and systematically allocated investment capital to innovations that promised the best returns, they lost their positions of leadership.\\"    How is that possible? The key is to understand the distinction between sustaining and disruptive innovation.  Large companies are good at sustaining innovation -- product improvements demanded by existing customers.     Disruptive technologies do not serve mainstream markets initially. In fact, the market may not be obvious at all.  Because there is no existing market, there is no reliable market research.  That's the innovator's dilemma.     Disruptive technologies are generally brought to market by start-ups.  They find their niche through trial and error.  Initially their functionality doesn't satisfy the mainstream, but with successive generations this problem is overcome, displacing the old technology.     Christensen concentrated on the disk drive industry because new generations of technology are released frequently.  However, the principles of disruptive technology are not limited to high technology. He also presents examples from the excavation equipment, steel, motorcycle, and retail industries.     This is an insightful, substantive book. The most notable weakness is the graphics.  The purpose of graphs is to present data in a visual form that is easy to digest.  Some of the graphs in this book add more confusion than clarity.
B0045JEPXK|5.0|Leona Lewis is the sort of artist you need to see as well as hear because she is beautiful and personable as well as a great singer.  I was so very pleased when the Tour DVD became available.  It is so well done that I felt I was at the concert.  Plus I have enjoyed the added feature of being able to select the individual song tracks from the DVD menu.  Come to think of it, I haven't even listened to the CD.  Leona Lewis is DVD material!    I am scratching my head about another reviewer who said her singing was bad.  Hey, on my system it was great! All I expected and more.  Plus the artistic expression was amazing.  I wonder, if that reviewer's sound system might need some tweeking?    I wish Leona all the best and can't wait for her next album.  I only hope it will include some video.

They cost more than their competitors but my equipment is worth the extra money.  This is a very simple case that is designed to do one thing; hold a small, cylindrically shaped video camcorder securely.  This case accomplishes that task, but only just that.  It is a little small for some of my cameras, which I demonstrate on this short video review.  I hope that my review is helpful to you.

B004I2K4E8|5.0|Great purchase! Lea Salonga's \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" was stirring and brlliant. Her voice has matured from when she played Eponine. Is it possible for her to be my favorite Eponine AND Fantine of all time??? The Jean Valjean quartet singing \\"Bring Him Home\\" during the encore was EPIC!!! Alfie Boe certainly has a new fan in me. (The \\"high octave surprise\\" hits you like nothing you have ever experienced before) Colm Wilkinson will always be Valjean in my mind and in this encore performance, he brings every emotion to the song. The man could almost sing with his face alone - he is that good! In spite of Nick Jonas and what I feel was a miscast for him to play Marius (which is so blatantly pointed out when Michael Ball delivers his first note during the incredible encore), I will maintain my 5 star rating. The blu-ray picture and sound quality were incredible!! As a huge fan of the original cast recording and the 10th anniversary concert, I highly recommend opening your hearts to this fresh and captivating take on what is probably the greatest musical of our time.
B00000F214|5.0|DUH! A great movie for all time. An oscar level performance by Kevin Spacey. Another great performance from the Crossing Delancy star Gabriel Byrne. I liked Chazz better in Oscar.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I started reading this off of a friend's recommendation, and was slightly skeptical when I read it was meant for grade 7 and up but I really enjoyed this book. The book itself is written simply, like what one might think how a seventh grade book is written, but it didn't take away from the story at all. I don't read much (mostly because of a lot of school work) but I couldn't put this book down. I read from about 20% into the book to the end on a Sunday, most of the time just thinking \\"okay, one more Chapter.\\" About seven hours later I ordered the second one for my Kindle and am going to start it tonight.

The case was broken, all of the dvd's fall out when I open it and half of the episodes either don't play or skip (I miss 3/4 of the episodes). Very disappointing. Save your money. I will not be ordering from here again.

B004I2K4E8|5.0|If you love music and life you don't want to miss this performance!<br /><br />Along with countless others I too have been an enthusiastic fan of this great work; I have had the opportunity to see it on stage and have owned the LaserDisc version of the 10th Anniversary Concert for many years. The power, beauty and drama of this work never fails to profoundly move me when I watch it and the melodies haunt me for days afterward.<br /><br />When I saw the 25th Anniversary Concert was available on Blu-ray I ordered it immediately; my first thought was how it would compare with the 10th Anniversary Concert that I had watched so many times on LaserDisc. I almost thought of myself as a judge who would sit in judgment and pronounce sentence.<br /><br />I wasn't very far at all into the performance before I lost that mindset; I was swept up by the beauty, power, and emotion of this performance. Yes it is different from the 10th Anniversary Concert but suddenly that was of absolutely no importance as I felt I was witnessing a glorious, emotional performance of fabulous music.<br /><br />To get the technical considerations out of the way; the video and audio are all you would expect from a contemporary Blu-ray recording. The picture is clear and crisp and the surround sound is a delight to the ears. The only real disappointment with this disc is the absence of any liner notes; no commentary, pictures, nothing. It doesn't really seem like too much to ask that something be added that gives information on the cast and performance.<br /><br />The performance itself left me feeling that I had received my money's worth and more; I noticed at the end of the disc, after the concert that people in the audience seemed to be milling about, not really ready to bring the evening to a close. I felt the same way as if a wonderful experience was over before I was really ready for it to end.<br /><br />The closing credits mentioned something I was unaware of, a movie version was in the works. Well hooray, finally a movie version of the entire musical! I had off and on been checking to see if a movie version with full staging and action was available but had always been disappointed to see that it had not.<br /><br />It appears that during an interview in Spain, last September, a journalist asked Cameron Mackintosh why a movie version of Les Miserable's had not been made. It is reported that he said a contract for a movie had been signed and he said in part,\\"We'll be working with a screenplay writer over the next few months and hopefully if all that comes together, we will find a great director and start.\\" That is really good news to those of us who have loved the concert versions.<br /><br />I'll not make an attempt at evaluating all of the individual performances but will say that Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean brings a truly memorable voice to the part. The other roles are handled with emotion, power, and conviction; I found I had tears rolling down my cheeks at several points during the performance. Two tidbits of casting trivia, Lea Salonga, who sings the role of Fantine in this production sang the role of Eponine in the 10th Anniversary Concert; Jenny Galloway performs as Mme Thenardier in both performances.<br /><br />If you enjoy great music, well performed, you really owe it to yourself to buy this disc; if you don't have Blu-ray then get the DVD, just don't fail yourself by not buying it!ire musical!

0375842209|4.0|Honestly I don't even know where to begin or how to review this book.  This was a tough book to read on many levels.  It was a long book and not something one can just blow through.  Is it possible to love a book yet hate the content at the same time?  What I mean by this is, the book was beautifully and creatively written.  It was narrated by \\"Death\\" which was haunting in itself.  I hated the content of the lack of humanity shown during the holocaust.  Each time I read a book about this time period it just makes me sick to my stomach the way Jewish people were treated.  This book is a heart-breaker to read.  People that are not affected by the holocaust must have stones for hearts.<br /><br />What was interesting to me, and I feel this each time I read a historical fiction book, was how very little people back in this era had.  Each day was a fight for survival to just have enough to eat to make it to the next day.  Here we live today in a world where we have more \\"things\\" (and food) in this life than ever, yet sadly, we are never satisfied.  This book is dark and haunting...yet it will most likely be one you will never forget reading.
076115678X|5.0|i ordered this book after seeing the author on the \\"today show\\".... it was a gift for my daughtor who has very curly hair....it was very informative and had some great ideas of how to control curly hair in humidity as well as ideas how to keep it healthy and attractive...a plus was the video that was included ...two items for one affordable price ...i would definately give it five stars
0061997811|5.0|This is the best book. And the best place to order it from. Believe me if you want the book and fast this is your best bet. I ordered Sunday night and recieved it on Saturday. There is also a tracking page that lets you see exactly where the truck is on the way. I tryed to order this book from 2 other companies and never recieved it. I was so happy when these guys had it show up on my doorstep. And the book is great. I especially like all the props inside. Especially the Marauders Map. Very awesome and extremely detailed. If you like Harry Potter this is a must have.
0385738757|1.0|i could not stop reading this book until i was 2/3 of the way through.  then i hated the way it was going so much that i threw the book away without bothering to finish it. the ending was terrible. i can't believe i wasted all my time reading this book. and that was definately the last book i'm reading by james dashner. really disappointing. is this a joke dashner?
159420229X|5.0|Witty, hilarious, fascinating, informative, and smoothly written--this book strikes the perfect balance between the narative and the research. It's that sweet-spot of non-fiction that you almost can't believe is real. Foer takes you on a fast and fun trip from his participation in the strange, ultra-geeky mnemonist subculture, to his research both historical and present day about memory.     I literally sped through this book, not wanting it to end. Foer's voice is smooth and polished as well as witty and a somewhat snarky. I look forward to his future books and his writings on Slate and elsewhere!
B003UESJF6|4.0|This is a 5 star movie for children.  My children loved it.  For grown ups, it is good too, but I would give<br />3 star for grown ups.  Thus the average 4 star.<br /><br />At first this movie leads you to believe that it is a typical good vs evil movie.  In a way, it is.  But there<br />is a twist.  In this case the good character is defeated.  Now what happens?  See, that is the question.<br /><br />For me it was not as good as Finding Nemo, or Toy Story series, but still it is a good movie.  I highly<br />recommend it.
B001CN2WXM|5.0|These were the days when the LA cops, from the top to the lower level, with few exceptions, felt that the most effective way to stop crime was to be as brutal as the criminals, including killing people who commit crimes the cops don't like and beating prisoners to get confessions. They also collected bribes. However, one cop (Guy Pearce) decides to reveal this to the public. He also wants to learn which cops killed his father, who was also a cop.<br /><br /> The film is filled with exciting, suspenseful, and interesting subplots. There is a millionaire pimp who has his prostitutes look like movie stars, which sometimes requires plastic surgery. One of the brutal cops (Russell Crowe) falls in love with one of them. One cop (Kevin Spacey) takes bribes from a newspaper man to help him get sensational stories. A person who is involved with Spacey is killed and Spacey wants to expose who did the crime and why.<br /><br /> There are many twists and turns in this suspenseful film, as well as double-crosses, cover-ups, and cops changing sides. The acting is excellent and the story is engrossing.
0679411585|5.0|Being that this is a \\"First Person\\" style it can be, at times, a bit dry but then it is much like a Court Transcript. But, unlike many such Transcripts this book tells as much of the Truth as is available and not just what the Judge wants to be included.

1435248244|4.0|I am a 7th grader and I had to read the book The Uglies as a reading assignment. When I read it, I found that it was very interesting.The author, Scott Westerfeld did a very good job in describing and putting picture a of what he is talking about in our minds. The story line of the book was also interesting. The plot really grabbed my attention since it included some \\"high-tech\\" things from the future, and also some words and food that we never even heard of. This kind of gave me the idea of what the future might look like if we stop global warming. This is another thing that got my attention in this book, since it's sort of a hidden moral inside the story. So now, not only is it a futuristic-fiction like story, but also a parable with an important lesson hidden in it. Another good thing that I found about this book is that it seems appropriate for anyone, even fourth graders or adults. I definitely think that people from all ages will want to read this book. Scott Westerfeld did a very good job writing The Uglies series. I would definitely recommend it to my friends.

B0000252YK|5.0|No matter what anybody says about this album, I loved it.  Prior to this album, I saw Ozzy on his \\"Speak of the Devil\\" tour with Brad Davis, the guitarist who made Night Ranger famous, and was not overly impressed.  However, when Ozzy hired Jake E. Lee, he got a great guitarist who was trying to make a name for himself.  His guitar playing is really great and the whole song collection is great too.  Regardless, that Ozzy never liked \\"Shot in the Dark\\" (atleast this version), I loved it.  Whether it was because of Ron Nevison's production or whatever, who knows, all I know is that I love it.  It was this album that bought me back to love Ozzy's music.  Howeever, I will never forgive Ozzy from cancelling three times on his \\"No More Tears\\" tour and I had to see Black Sabbath w/ Ronnis James Dio on their Dehumanizer tour.  This album is a very good rocker and should be looked as that.  It does rock and I will always love this album above all of Ozzy's other albums.  If you are a fan of Ozzy, you awe it to yourself to put this album in you collection.  It is that good!!  Listen to your heart, not only your ears, like I did with Kiss's Music From the Elder and loved that album and always will.  If you love Ozzy, like I do, add this album to your collection.

1439102724|1.0|Normally I love Jodi Picoult's books, having read every single one, but this book lacks all the usual sparks and leaves the reader wanting a refund. For starters, the sub-characters that are so often brought into her other novels are lacking here. We never get any perspective except that of the three main characters themselves. We certainly won't be seeing many reoccurring characters appear in upcoming novels like in previous books. Second, the relationship between Zoe and Max dissolves too quickly while the relationship between Zoe and Vanessa is moved too far too quickly. The characters do not lament on their actions, nor is it explained to the reader, leaving them to put the puzzle pieces together themselves. The lack of character development is  the most disappointing considering Picoult's previous work.     Then she touches (barely) on incredibly sensitive issues such as infertility, alcoholism and same sex relationships/marriage that is rushed along with the rest of the plot. Finally, the ending left so much to be desired. It was all wrapped and presented to us with a bow that only looks pretty from the outside. It lacks the normal surprise that Picoult has been known for, and leaves several gigantic holes that she feels is not necessary to delve any further, barely scratching the surface of the plot twist she has lead the reader to. Altogether, this book was a failure that will be donated to my local library rather than take up precious bookshelf space.

Regardless, when I was reading it, I had the feeling that I was reading a piece of journalism, thus was none too surprised when I read the author was exactly that.<br /><br />A bit dry, but a strong story none-the-less.
0723236720|5.0|This book was a paperback version and I was concerned that it would be too big to read comfortably since it contains the complete tales.  It was very easy to handle and read comfortably.  Both of my 10 year old sons read it easily.  Definitely recommended reading for all children.

B003Y5H54W|3.0|Here's the math:<br /><br />An old-fashioned romance + Werewolves = Red Riding Hood (2011)?<br /><br />Doesn't seem add up in my book.<br /><br />If I didn't know better, I'd swear this was a re-tooled \\"The Howling (remember that movie?)\\"<br /><br />Ultimately predicable.  No mystery here.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I really like the cast - an excellent group.  Their efforts would have been better<br /><br />spent in another endeavor.<br /><br />What's next?  Goldilocks? (I hope not...)<br /><br />Another time-honored fairy tail corrupted by Hollywood.<br /><br />Frankly, I prefer the Warner Brother animated cartoon starring Bugs Bunny...but that's just me...<br /><br />I rate Red Riding Hood...3 stars.

B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|Funniest album ever!!!  I can listen to every song without the urge to skip any songs (maybe one).  Bruno uses relaxing reggae melondies with fun lyrics.  If you looking for a deep emotional album, keep looking.  If your looking for fun, carefree, then you found it.
0439023513|2.0|Collins wraps up the tale of Katniss and the world of Panem in her third and final novel in The Hunger Games trilogy, Mockingjay. After being pleasantly suprised when Catching Fire was even more thrilling than its predecessor, The Hunger Games, I was extremely excited for this book to be released. Unfortunately, it is highly disappointing and not really worth reading. In truth, I would much rather have had the series end with two very good books than three books that ended on a poor note. Katniss now becomes the Mockingjay, the symbol for revolution against the tyrannical Capitol. District 13 plays a large part in this book, as it contrives to bring about the fall of the Capitol. SPOILER ALERT: Then, randomly, Peeta is brainwashed into despising Katniss. It is this point that made the book ultimately angering. It was terribly unnecessary. It was almost as though Collins wanted to continue the cliched theme of romance against a backdrop of war and this was the only way she could keep Katniss and Peeta's relationship fresh.     Essentially, Collins ran out of things to write about. Tyranny became almost boring in this new book. Rebellion lost its tangy flavor. The book felt dry and flat as I read it. It was like going from a delicious filet to uncooked oatmeal in terms of book quality. The plot was bland, the writing was mediocre, and the romance anything but fresh. For lovers of this trilogy, prepare to face complete and utter disappointment with this installment.

B003UESJJC|5.0|As an owner of the previous 'Complete Dossier' DVD version, which omitted the 'Hearts of Darkness' documentary and split the 2 versions of the film up across 2 discs, I was happy to find that this release corrected all of those issues.    This edition comes with both versions of the film, both the original masterpiece and the inferior-but-interesting 'Redux' version with added scenes, both restored and both with an excellent excellent HD transfer that looks nothing short of amazing. This is undoubtedly the best the film has ever looked. No digital fiddling, no unnecessary grain removal, it simply looks astounding, and is a big improvement over the DVD issues. The audio is similarly excellent.    The included documentary is a big plus for fans, as previously it was only available separately.    Given the wonderful transfer, the abundance of extras, and the rather nice packaging I would not hesitate to call this this best available version of the film and an absolute must-have for your Bluray collection.    EDIT: Also, why the devil has Amazon lumped the reviews for past DVD releases together with the Bluray release? This Bluray release is totally different from all past DVD releases. When reading other reviews make sure the reviewer is actually talking about this version, and not an older DVD issue.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|People care about people, this is not obvious, but in this movie you can see how what go's around, comes around so beautifully, and simply.  it's so nice to see the transformation which the characters are going through, warms my heart, and give me hope that things might be different, now and simple for all of us, only if we care about and for one another.  The movie is done in a special way, unlike many movies, the story looks simple, yet it's full of depth which you would like to dive into and become one with the plot...    This movie will warm your heart and cleanse it as well, you will love life more after watching it...  Micha

030746363X|5.0|The first thing I do when I look at a book on Amazon is to read the reviews. I start with the best long reviews, and then read all of the one and two star reviews.<br /><br />I almost didn't buy this book because of all the negative reviews that mentioned the suspicious nature of the five stare reviews.<br /><br />The book turned out to be my favorite book so far this year. It is not written by a doctor. Ferris is a guy that tries all sorts of different experiments on himself to find out what works and what does not.<br /><br />I will not do some of these experiments, because I think some of the supplements are on the dangerous side. (NO-Explode for example.) But I did enjoy reading about how they turned out for Tim.<br /><br />I think some of my fellow reviewers have a cynical view of good reviews and they should think about how enjoyable and interesting the book was to read rather than if his ideas match up to theirs.
B003Y8YXH6|5.0|If you're assembling a 1970-2010 Beatles CD-R/iPod collection consisting of the best of the solo Beatles, I suggest using the following tracks from `Stripped Down' instead of what was heretofore available: `(Just Like) Starting Over', `I'm Losing You', `Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)' and `Cleanup Time'. The originals, let's face it, were overproduced, mainly because John was feeling particularly insecure about his voice. So these four are, with appropriate fades implemented, MUCH preferable. The `Stripped Down' `Dear Yoko' is also better, but it's still not as good as the version on `The Lennon Anthology', which Lennon sings with abandon. As for `Woman' and `Watching the Wheels', I think the gloss on the originals was warranted and makes those the better versions.  As for Yoko's stuff, I didn't listen to it, mainly because I never had a problem with her original versions. Plus, Yoko and John are for the most part a mismatch on record. One is better off alternating the best of Yoko's tracks with the best of step-son Julian or son Sean--as per the bonus CDs suggested in the book cited above. This is no slight to Yoko. I believe that Yoko at her best is one of the more formidable female pop artists of the past 40 years. Granted she's an acquired taste, but for Beatles/John fans, it's a (selective) taste worth acquiring.  Three decades is a heck of a long interval, but thank God that Yoko and Jack Douglas buried the hatchet and got this project done. Four greatly-improved tracks justify their efforts.
B000001E3V|5.0|This collection is a Jam fan's delight, no song is less than 5 minutes; there are 5 Songs over 10 minutes and \\"Let It Rain\\" approaches 20 minutes. \\"LatF\\" contains the slowest Blues version of Crossroads available, and one of the most Blues/Funk versions of \\"Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad? (Live)\\". The \\"Presence Of The Lord (Live)\\" version is simply haunting. This is not the slick studio produced 3:41's meant for radio FM Eric Clapton, but a master of long form in fine form.

B0042RUMJG|4.0|As a collector of numerous concerts, I really found this one to be very nice to add to my collection. The blue ray has exceptional video with crisp detailed views. From the opening number, I can count every scratch on the top/bottom/center of his fender guitar. Almost every angle is presented clearly as the cameras change viewing. As noted by others, the center channel is diluted to other speakers, but what they failed to mention, is that it is FEW! And far between that have it right on the DTS, I have to make speaker adjustments on almost all my concerts to accommodate these issues which you can't get it perfect this way, but you can get better--- unless you have a non- friendly amp/system. I even have to change the equal on a number.  OR,,, just take it as-is and enjoy. But for the 30 seconds to make adjustments that I have documented for each concert- well worth the time- they are not all the same- period.  It is a dvd that you will certainly watch over and over again, my system his uses HDMI cables for all the hook ups. I note this only because some feedback leaves me wondering whether they used the proper cables- could of??? Just don't know what others do.  Using a Yamaha 863 receiver to power the klip's reference spkers. If you belong to Netflix, you should try finding your dvd's there for a trial test before buying. Most are there for watching- save you from buying losers which I will say I have done before becoming a member and just going by others reviews.
B0039ZF8D2|4.0|From the moment I first heard Damien Marley, I liked his style. Nas had to really grow on me. He is my best friend's favorite musician, so I really gave him a chance and now I appreciate and like him a lot. He is quite talented. Quite a lyricist. When I heard they teamed up to create an album together, I became excited. I saw all the rave reviews magazines and reviewers gave it, so I wanted to listen for myself. I, too, enjoyed this album. This is certainly an album with substance. They speak on issues relevant in the world today as well as perennial issues. I love when artists have great subject matter in their songs.<br /><br />Nas and Damien sound good together and their styles compliment each other. \\"Count Your Blessings\\" is one of this album's finest moments. It is a positive track with a great melody, hook and beat. The title basically gives the song's message away. \\"Africa Must Wake Up\\" has a sad tone, but it's another song I thoroughly enjoyed. This track has lots of guitar. The lyrics are profound. At 7 minutes, it is the most lengthy song on the album, but it's a really good song. It's one of the songs you will take with you once the album is over. \\"My Generation\\" features Lil' Wayne and Joss Stone. Damien Marley does an awesome job. The hook is repetitive, but the message gets through: my generation will make a change.<br /><br />I will listen to this album again. I was entertained throughout. I hope they collaborate again very soon!<br /><br />Mikeisha's Top 5<br /><br />1. \\"Africa Must Wake Up\\"<br />2. \\"Count Your Blessings\\"<br />3. \\"Strong Will Continue\\"<br />4. \\"As We Enter\\"<br />5. \\"Leaders\\"
B0039TD7PY|4.0|Ok, let me first get this out of the way, several reviews noted the sound to be( and have  state-of-the-art systems).... Disappointing.  No note about their system- but, I have klip's \\"reference\\" spks all around powered by Yamaha 863. And maybe these are not considered \\"state\\", but I can assure you that when I hear the song \\" its too late\\", the strings off JT guitar are so vivid that they just go up my back,, that good.  You can just feel the strings resonating. I just can't figure it out? BUT! Be aware, like most dvd's, usually they start out in HDDTS, or DTS 5.1 right off the bat- This dvd- DOES NOT. You must go into the audio setup and change it to the DTS setting- EVERY TIME you load it. Same with Hall & oats at the troubadour (blue ray).Anyway, love the comments on voices seem a little flat, Let's be real here, do you look anything like you did 40 years ago? Yeah- right!  OK, for a non- blue ray, the video is well above par, I am watching this on a 220\\" screen and still impressive- can you see the signature on Leland's guitar below the sound hole--- BB XXXX, or below the machine heads,,, love, Pasadena, D,hxxxxx? Or any others? you figure them out,  Still impressed with the quality.  Troubadour is a nice setting and lighting is more than adequate. But the sound in 5.1 mode is just great!  Yes, it is a collection of old hits but it always seems that concerts add a little different twist and I have to say that I never bought one of his albums, but, I never bought Chicago or EWF--- but live at the Greek,  WOW!  The two do well together and compared to most concerts, you will enjoy it- set the sound up right!

B00139W3NE|5.0|This is  new theme in fantasy, it combines the 1800's look with advance technology in everything like transportation methods etc. For another way, and maybe the reason the other 2 parts never came out (people protesting); was the use of words that in the world of the movie have a different meaning than ours, just like: demon, lord, witch..etc.     People though that because the writer is atheist, he tried some how to confuse children..and other abnormalities that only closed minded beings can believe.    Lots of action, adventure, suspence etc can be found is this 2 hour long movie...no matter what people said about the \\"vocabulary\\", is good for the enjoyment of all family members. :D
B000FC1MOQ|5.0|I listened to this book on audio disc and I couldnt turn it off. It was intriguing. While I was listening I was not thinking whether or not it was a true story, I was fascinated on the writing and its descriptions. In my opinion it was very well said. So the author may have exaggerated many of the points, but thats what writers do to sell books. Just the fact that he was an addict and can write so beautifully says alot about the book itself. I had no problem recognizing the facts from the misleading statements. Im wondering if the author didnt exaggerate some of his experiences for effect, maybe thinking that it would scare people into avoiding addiction, not treatment. I do agree that he should not have tried to mislead the public and should have said from the start that some facts are a bit over rated. It would not  have hurt sales any. Although the whole controversy and dispute probably doubled sales just because thats the kind of sheeple we are.
0756404738|5.0|I think all the other reviews pretty much nailed it. It is a great book. There is one thing I would like to add though. It is a book written by a nerd and a thinker. That might not sound like it is a big deal but it is. That means things are thought through and intelligent. Now days our shallow movies seem to be made by a committee of bickering idiots too high to care if the plot or science makes sense and our books seem to be a never ending stream of shallow \\"me too!\\"s that follow half a dozen characters to help fill the pages. This one though really seems almost as if a sharp science fiction writer tried his hand at fantasy and instead of the stereotypical dwarves and elves fighting dragons etc... we end up with something quite interesting. It seems to be a book twice as well thought out as the others but with enough sense to only take it's self half as seriously.
B00006G8K0|5.0|Hammer Studios decided they wanted to come out with their own version of Bram Stoker's legendary 1897 novel \\"Dracula\\" some 27 years after Tod Browning's classic 1931 movie Dracula, starring Bela Lugosi, paved the way.  People always compare and contrast these two movies because one was the original that blazed the trail while the second one has its own unique identity.  The 1931 version is in black and white, has slow pacing, no musical score, and has a dark and creepy atmosphere throughout.  In contrast, the 1958 movie is in color, has much faster pacing, a dramatic and bombastic musical score, and has a much brighter atmosphere.  Of course, the inevitable comparison is always made between Bela Lugosi's portrayal of Dracula vs. Christopher Lee's portrayal.  You be the judge.<br /><br />Now it's time to review Horror Of Dracula (1958), starring Peter Cushing as Van Helsing, Christopher Lee as Dracula, Michael Gough as Arthur, Carol Marsh as Lucy, Melissa Stribling as Mina, and John Van Eyssen as Jonathan Harker.  This movie is only 81 minutes long.  I feel that it's a little too short for a movie based on Bram Stoker's novel.  A movie based on Stoker's novel needs to be a little longer because there is such a large amount of material to cover.  I don't think it should be 2 1/2 hours long like the 1977 BBC miniseries Count Dracula (which is TOO long), but Horror Of Dracula could have benefited from an extra 20 minutes or more so the suspense can build and more character development can take place.  The movie is too condensed into 81 minutes.  I do think, however, that it's kind of hard to make a movie based on Stoker's novel to begin with because the slower parts of the novel pretty much force changes to be made to the plot, characters, etc.  In order to include everything in the novel, including the boring stuff, the movie needs to be a 2 1/2 hour BBC miniseries like Count Dracula.  The result is a movie that drags.  If you want a movie with faster pacing, you have to cut out a lot from the novel and make other changes.  The pacing problem is solved, but Horror Of Dracula is TOO short.  Movies such as Dracula (1979), which is 110 minutes, and Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992), which is 130 minutes, are just right.<br /><br />I think Christopher Lee is a good Dracula.  He doesn't say much throughout the movie, but he had to do what was given to him.  Peter Cushing is a good Van Helsing.  He's all business.  His acting is good.  Michael Gough's acting is somewhat wooden.  The musical score by James Bernard is good and is pretty bombastic and powerful.  I like a lot of the colorful sets that were used.  They add that classic Hammer \\"touch\\" to the movie.<br /><br />Hammer Studios was hampered by a low to moderate budget.  This movie's special effects can't compare to later movies, such as the 1977, 1979, and 1992 movies, but this movie was good for 1958.

B001HNE3NO|5.0|This book was remarkably lovely despite dealing with a depressing subject matter, and on top of that, the historical facts underpinning the story were all new to me, which made this book fascinating and terrible and sad, but still something I'm grateful I read.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|When the Alien Quadrilogy was released in 2003, it was a truly impressive set for fans of the franchise, containing both the theatrical, and extended or director's cuts of all four films [Alien (1979), Aliens (1986), Alien 3 (1992) and Alien Resurrection (1997)].  In additional each film had a separate disc with bonus materials, and finally there was a ninth disc with even more bonus materials related to the series.  At the time the set was premium priced, but given the quantity and quality of the material, The Quadrilogy was one set that really gave you your money's worth, far superior to the four disc Alien Legacy (1999) set.<br /><br />The Blu-ray set, Alien Anthology (2010), is currently regarded as the best versions of these films available.  The Quadrilogy is out of production, and may have lost some of its luster, but it is still a fantastic collection, and can be found used, at very reasonable prices, as Alien fans look to upgrade to the Blu-ray set.  The Quadrilogy is a great buy for casual fans who may not have all of these films.  The bonus material is prodigious, highly informative, and helps place these films in historical context.  About the only disappointment is that there is very little heard from David Fincher, the director of Alien 3.  Unfortunately, Fincher's side of the story regarding the making of Alien 3, has to this day, yet to be adequately told.<br /><br />A true classic in the realm of science fiction, the Alien films are each distinct, and featured directors who at the time were relatively unheralded.  Ridley Scott (Black Hawk Down, Blade Runner, Gladiator, Body of Lies), James Cameron (Titanic, Terminator 2, Avatar, True Lies), and David Fincher (Se7en, Zodiac, Panic Room, The Game, The Social Network) have all had rather illustrious post-Alien careers.  Alien Resurrection director Jean Pierre Jenut's work may not be as well-known outside of France, but many of his films (Micmacs, Amelie, The City Of Lost Children), have generally been very well regarded critically.  Sigorney Weaver has been the backbone of the series as Ellen Ripley, the role that has defined her career. The evolution and growth of the character has been both interesting, and quite remarkable.<br /><br />For hours of excitement, and an in depth journey into the creative process and significance of the Alien films, the Quadrilogy could be a fantastic addition to your collection.garded critically.

B002ZG99A4|4.0|I confess - I just like action movies!  Worth watching if you're the same way.  Almost as good as RED, with Willis and Malkovich.  Both very good if you're in to shoot-em-ups.  Can only speak to the DVD version, don't have blu-ray player.
B001GWK2MC|1.0|We purchased this product for a Christmas present for our kids and it has been a disappointment almost from the beginning. Our kids have used the product a little bit each week for just over 2 months now and it is almost ready for the trash can.  Within one month the front of the Bouncer tore away from the main unit which was a disappointment but wasn't a great concern.  But starting at the 2 month point, holes started to develop in the unit and while we tape them one by one, more and more are beginning to appear.  Our kids truly do love the Bouncer unit for it being fun and the undeniable entertainment value.  However, the quality is nowhere near where it should be.  We would have at least exprected 6 months to one year of use from the Bouncer - only two months is unacceptable.  While the price is nice - we would certainly NOT recommend this unit due to it's poor quality construction.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I was shocked at some of the reviews on this they obviously only watched a couple parts of this movie. It was phenominal, best I have seen. I was glued to the TV and watched it all in 2 days. Tom Hanks did an amazing job.I also dont think it should be compaired to band of brothers! They are totally differnt wars!!! and I liked both series but I do lean towards Pacific since it was easier to see since all of it wasn't filmed dark, but they all went with as close to reality as they could get, with what information they had. The interviews with the marines at the end is definently worth watching also. your heart goes out to them!
1615238948|5.0|This was an excellent book.  I grew up in Virginia and know of its past as far as slavery and plantation life.  This seems so real, I got lost in it.  The author gives insight into what it must have been like living as a slave, an indentured servant, and a woman at the end of the 1700's.  The book grabs you and leads you through the lives of a southern tobacco farm family and the servants that are enslaved on the plantation.  If you like historical fiction...you will love this book even though it takes you through the sadness that these women and men endured.

Much has been made in the commentary about the miscasting of Nick Jonas, and there is much to be said on that -- though it is also worth noting that Jonas played in Les Miserable's original Broadway run back in 2003, playing Gavroche, so I was willing to cut him a bit of slack. That said, lacking the controlled diaphragm of the rest of the cast made him stand out for his lacks, sadly.    Beyond that, while there was perhaps too much hamminess in some of the emoting, it was in the end an extraordinary production. If you like this musical (or just the music from it), this would be a good choice. If you aren't familiar, the 10th anniversary is probably a better choice as a start.

B000JLSM00|5.0|\\"The Searchers\\" is reportedly Martin Scorsese's favorite film and he claims that he watches it once or even twice a year. As a bonus feature on the Blu Ray edition they interview him and he talks about his love and admiration for this film.    Every time I watch it I gain greater insight and appreciation.  So many little things occur that are subtle, like the relationship that is hinted at between Ethan and his brother's wife through the use of visual clues, but not dialogue.   I am beginning to see why it is regarded as a masterpiece by most critics and directors including Scorsese, Spielberg, and Lucas.  The American Film Institute lists it as the greatest western ever made.    The cinematography looks spectacular on Blu Ray.   \\"The Searchers\\" wasn't appreciated when it was made, failing to get even one Academy Award nomination, but its stature continues to climb with each passing year.  Highly recommended.

B000002IOY|5.0|This album rocks. This is the first Overkill album I bought and it is how I got introduced to them years and years ago, to be more exact 1989. I used to stay up late at night just to see the Elimination on Headbangers Ball, or listen to my walkman as I was leaving my high school. I introduced this band to a lot of my class mates, and I still do that today. This band does not get the credit that they should. I believe that in a lot of aspects, this band never lost their trand, period. They stay true to their metal genre and keeps rocking. I saw the band in Orlando in November 2010, and Blitz still rocks like he did in the 1980's. Including Elimination song in their concert is a must. If you have not heard this album, you are missing out on a band that should be considered an inductee in the metal HALL OF FAME, among Slayer, Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax, Testament.
0756404738|3.0|I absolutely loved The Name of The Wind. I have recommended it to everyone I know and will talk about it with anyone. I assumed after waiting for The Wise Man's Fear to come out, that I would be even more willing to talk up this book. However, this is not the case.    Simply, nothing happens in the book. Sure there are events that take place but to what purpose to the book? We have little stories within this longer story of Kvothe's life but we don't really learn anything substantial. With the Maer, he goes there, further expands his reputation, leaves and comes back and its the end. It seemed like this was only included so Kvothe had access to Maer's funds. The bandits section was pointless. The characters introduced were dry and predictable. Going with Tempi, you knew what would happen.     I saw no overall anticipation in the story. There is never a huge build up to anything substanial. It didn't further push along Kvothe's search for the chandrian nor did we learn anything of the present day Kvothe.    The style though was upped a notch by Rothfuss. Despite everything I read it in a four days and would not pass any section so it was still readable.

0756404738|3.0|Before buying this book, I re-read The Name of the Wind so that the story would be fresh in my mind. I was eagerly awaiting the sequel. After finishing it, it left me with mixed feelings...    I won't spoil too much in this review, but I just want to point out the main flaw with this book: nothing happens. The general feel reminded me of book 8-10 of The Wheel of Time, and that's not a good thing. Like Jordan, Rothfuss is a good storyteller, so the whole book is still decently entertaining. However, the story pacing is wrong. Having read Rothfuss' blog and how he painstakingly edited down the size of the book over the years, I was surprised at the end result.    The first quarter of the book describes a single term at the University, where nothing major happens. Just some more bickering between Kvothe and Ambrose. There is a bandit hunt that could have been cut down to half the size (really, we didn't need to hear details like the supply runs rotations). It's especially jarring, since they end up finding their quarries with a Deus Ex Machina anyway, so the whole description of the search felt a bit pointless. The time spent with Felurian should have been cut down as well. The Adem were slightly more interesting, but I got the feeling that everything went a bit too easily for Kvothe.    All in all a decent read, but like another previewer mentions, if you completely skip this book before reading part three you probably won't be too lost. Kvothe learned about sex, a bit of fighting and he got a new cloak. When you can resume a whole book in a single 14 words sentence without forgetting anything important, there's a problem. There's a little bit more groundwork laid down about the main storyline, but precious few of it.    That said, it's still a good read if you enjoyed the first book. You just aren't likely to be blown away with anything in the second volume.
0312370849|3.0|This book is part historical fiction, set in 1942 Paris, and part modern. The first part tells the story of Sarah Starcyzinski, a young French Jewish girl born of Polish parents. The events take place during July of that year, when the \\"Vel Dhiv\\" roundup took place--with thousands of Jewish families arrested (by French police, not the Gestapo) and initially held in a cycling velodrome, then moved first to interment camps within France and eventually on to Auschwitz. Sarah has her own particular horror to live through that involves her young brother Michel, who gets left behind when the family is arrested.<br /><br />Meanwhile, in modern-day Paris, Julia Jarmond, a middle-aged American now living in Paris (and married to a Frenchman) is set to move into the apartment where Sarah's family lived in 1942. Julia discovers this connection when she begins researching the \\"Vel Dhiv\\" roundup for a newspaper article she's writing and then, when she learns that her husband's family took the apartment when a Jewish family was arrested, becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to that family, which eventually leads her to Sarah's trail. The two stories intersect, of course.<br /><br />This book sounded a lot better than it was. I didn't like the main character in the modern part very much, and there was a point in the last third of the book where Sarah's voice goes away and her story is left dangling until Julia finishes it--and that's when I really lost interest, not really wanting to put up with all of the whiny Julia's ramblings. I enjoyed the story overall, and learning about an event in history that I really had no knowledge of, but it could have done with a lot less of the minutiae of Julia's life.

I use it to hold my Nebo Quatro (1\\" barrel diameter - 1 3/8 lens diameter), and it's almost too hard to put the flashlight into the holster unless you take the holster off your belt.<br /><br />On the other hand, a AA mini-MAG light slips right in easily.

0670022411|3.0|This is a clever and ambitious book filled with historical, scientific, and literary references that are often interesting, especially if you like trivia. Unfortunately, the author was too fond of them. There are so many, each one accompanied by explanation, that the first half of the novel often feels repetitve and tedious. I kept waiting for the story to start.<br /><br />Although at times very imaginative and even charming, \\"A Discovery of Witches\\" is too long and would have benefitted from much more editing, especially early on. Despite an intriguing, Harry Potter-like \\"hook\\" at the beginning, the plot soon comes to a dead (pardon the pun) halt, and little happens for many chapters to follow. The pace of the novel's first half is glacial, with endless pages devoted to the heroine choosing her outfits, drinking tea, or rowing on the river. Much of this section could easily have been tightened up or eliminated altogether.<br /><br />Finally, an interesting plot does start rolling in the book's second half. The main characters are appealing, and I found myself rooting for them.  However, I think \\"Discovery\\" would have benefitted from  a little less soul-searching earnestness and a little more Gothic excess and humor. There's a lot of brooding and pining going on. A novel about vampires and witches doesn't have to have the romantic mooniness of \\"Twilight\\"  or the goofy absurdity of the goings-on in Bon Temps, but it should have magic. \\"Discovery\\" is about magic, but it isn't very magical. Perhaps that will improve in the books to come.<br /><br />Although I thought the \\"Twilight\\" books were okay, my favorite vampire novels (besides the classic \\"Dracula\\") remain Steven King's \\"Salem's Lot\\" (super scary) and Nora Roberts' \\"Valley of Silence\\" (gripping and passionate).<br /><br />Oh, and just a final thought:  King and Roberts got it right, so could vampires PLEASE go back to having fangs?

B0034G4P7G|4.0|It's not often that one finds a documentary movie based on a true story and stays interested, wondering, and maybe even admiring until the very last-minute. These were my feelings after watching the movie.<br /><br />Whereas I don't want to spoil it for those who didn't watch it, I must mention that the director, screenwriters, and actors did a fantastic job with keeping the tempo of the movie fast paced and exciting.
B000LB7G00|5.0|This device is a must have for anyone working extensively with 3D models.  It allows you to control the model in ways you just can't do with the keyboard and standard mouse clicks.  I was initially worried about the ergonomics, however there are days that I use it for 8+ hours a day and don't have any issues with my hand getting tired etc.  I was intially using the older ball style 3D mouse and this is a big step-up in improvement.  The new joystick style controller provides just the right amount of resistance and feedback to give you a positive \\"feel\\" for controlling the model.  I just can't say enough positive things about this device other than you have to try it and use it to really understand what you've been missing.
B004AKCME8|4.0|Over the last weekend I watched two movies. One thing they had in common was that I didn't expect to be thrilled by any of them. And I was wrong. I really liked The Social Network, and I was really impressed by Legend of The Guardians. Yet, I didn't believe that someone can produce a really moving epic story about owls. I don't have anything against owls per se, but they aren't well-known superheroes.<br /><br />As mentioned, the story is involving, and compelling. Nevertheless, equally good or even better was the animation and visual effects used to tell the story. Altogether, the Legend of The Guardians deserves surprisingly high 4 stars.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|While I have been waiting for this book with bated breath, I also had one major reservation: The Empire Strike Back. I knew going in that this was the second book in a trilogy and worried that the action would stall and leave me unfulfilled. To a certain extent, I was right: no majors conflicts are resolved, the story expands in ways that I didn't even realize it needed to, and the things I really wanted to see addressed were barely touched on. However, I still had to give this book a five. The major conflicts were not resolved, but they were deepened, made more real, and the tension was raised even higher. Kvothe is neither deified by an adoring public nor shunned as a pariah, but he grows as a person and becomes, if not more relatable, more understandable. While the antagonists are not soundly vanquished, new conflicts enter in that more than make up for it. This is a middle book, and it shows, but that doesn't make this anything less than a stellar read.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|I really do like the album, but I REALLY liked Waking the Fallen and Sounding the Seventh Trumpet because it was really strong underground metal and this album was definitely to capture a wider audience and go for more money and radio play. In my opinion this was the last really good A7X album because their self titled and nightmare were just all punk and no metal it really disappointed me because they are incredibly good, but because they are going mainstream they are losing original fans and capturing scene kids who like the band because the sound is catchy and when they stop making albums they say they suck and find something different. I listen to a lot of different metal and for people who are still saying \\"Oh A7X isn't metal they're emo punks who can never compare to metallica and original metal.\\" By the way Metallica sold out too so don't say that metallica is the best metal band ever because after the black album they SUCKED. I love metallica but they sold out just like most awesome metal band and I really hope that A7X will make one album in the future that goes back to the early stuff that was the real deal.    R.I.P.

1594201927|3.0|Ferguson's book provides an interesting general financial history that is written at an easy to follow and straightforward level. More advanced students of economics, finance and economic history might feel a bit let down, but the general reader should find enough in the book to inform and entertain. The book has a definite Western bias and some greater detail on Eastern economic history would have added greatly to the book, especially as it is billed as a \\"Financial History of the World.\\" Later chapters seem at times to lack the detail and depth that earlier chapters contained and it appears that the author rushed to complete the book as the first cracks started to appear in the world economy during 2007.
B003UESJH4|5.0|\\"The King's Speech\\" is an exceptional piece of film work. It offers an outstanding ensemble cast, excellent directon, the meticulously recreated period look of 1930's Britain, and even a sense of impending doom at the oncoming avalanche of Nazi Germany and the Second World War.  However, what makes it a great movie is the intensely human story at the heart of the film.<br /><br />Prince Albert (Colin Firth), nicknamed Bertie by his family, is the second son of King George V.  He is a dutiful son, borther, husband, and father, and an officer in the Royal Navy.  He has also a painful stammer.  When we first meet him, he is making a botch job of a public speech.  His wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) drags him from one speech therapist to the next, hoping for a cure.  That search takes him to the unorthodox Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), who may understand the problem, and may have a solution.<br /><br />The relationship between Logue and the Prince, as they battle through a difficult therapy process, is awkward, even painful to watch, but utterly engaging.  When Bertie unexpectedly becomes King George VI, with the nation on the verge of war, enabling the King to find his voice becomes a matter of state importance.<br /><br />\\"The King's Speech\\" is very highly recommended for its fine acting and its excellent story.  It is undoubtedly a bit of a dramatization of history, but then, movies do that, in this case, to very good effect.
B004HGBUVG|3.0|After that great run of albums from 'Car Wheels' to 'West' I'm afraid with the exception of a few tracks on 'Little Honey' and 'Blessed' its been a downhill slide for me. Lucinda found love and made that plain on 'Little Honey, particularly with the extended tracks 'Rarity' and 'Knowing'. On the latest we've got 'Awakening'. Mixed up with all of these slower cuts she's belting out over-heavy stuff like 'Honey Bee' and 'It's a Long Way to the Top'. I don't quite know what it is, whether her voice ain't what it used to be or that the quality of her songwriting has been affected by 'Real Love!' Too many (about 8) of them really drone on a bit I'm afraid. I'm a big fan and on this album I love 'Copenhagen', Seeing Black' and 'Awakening.' Add these to 'Best of Lucinda' I guess.

B0030Y11XS|1.0|I have always seen Moore's movies because they are  basic and  with most of the comments and  facts taken out of real life situations as you can see on videos and newspapers  shown throughout the video. So, situations  are credible. What I cannot  understand is that he does not know basic terms. What he talks about here is Mercantilism and not Capitalism.  Also he does not give options, just one where  a factory is own and worked by the owners, to make profit ( on what ever amount could be made, which is based on how well you serve your customers and not by greed as he intends to put it. And by the way is the original idea of capitalism( Make profit, any form of it, to go from a situation to a better situation, not mixing any emotions. This is human nature.) I would recommend this video  to learn about Mercantilism, and to Mr. Moore to read more about terms and words before making a video with such \\"unknown words\\". Also he does not give alternatives of systems, which is part of a good problem debate. The video is really entertaining and informative. You can add knowledge  to your whole concepts of the world. SO this is why he got 1 star.
B000FC1192|3.0|Though I do like the author's works, he seems to leave me wanting. I'm always hopeful of a better experience from his writing, but seem to come up short each time. Coraline was no different in that respect. It had a creepy feeling, but never really hit me the way I'd hoped it would. Maybe the animated version is better at delivering. Not a bad read by any means, but just kind of, not there in the end.
B0034G4P7G|4.0|\\"The Social Network\\" pushes boundaries between communication, both good and bad -- right and wrong -- light and dark. Some stories about corruption are sometimes poorly executed, but \\"Network\\" does not skimp on the amazing story about how two friends became enemies, over a little thing called Facebook.<br /><br />Mark Zuckerberg -- menace, geek, traitor (well, at least according to the DVD cover) -- is in Harvard; yes, he's trying to come up with the next big idea, but he can't. He doesn't have a lot of friends, he's arrogant, single, and his ego is as big as the Sun and Moon combined. This, unfortunately, slows down his momentum. However, one night, when intoxicated and recently dumped, Zuck creates a website dedicated to Erica Albright (his ex), comparing her and other girls on a hotness ratio. Not only does he embarrasses her through Facemash.com (the comparision site), he ruins her reputation at her college by calling her a 'bitch' on his popular blog, in addition to correcting her bra size and her family name.<br /><br />See how vindictive boys can be? But Mark doesn't stop there!<br /><br />With the help from a few of his programming friends and his best mate Eduardo Saverin, he creates theFacebook, a site dedicated to Harvard students who are looking to connect with their peers easier.<br /><br />But wait, there's more! Not only did Mark steal the idea from three other students at Harvard -- who wanted to help him restore his new-found badass image with Facemash.com by helping them with Harvard Connection (a dating site for Harvard students) -- he also dupes his friend Eduardo into helping him expand the site. Not only does Mark expand, he begins to piss a lot of people off, including Eduardo, who has his own plans for Facebook.<br /><br />Brilliant movie, excellent cast, terrific score, awesome cinematography. Not only does \\"The Social Network\\" pushes buttons, it shows you how some things in life aren't fair -- at all. So you must fight the battle that comes along with it.<br /><br />Starring Jesse Eisenberg as Mark, Andrew Garfield as Eduardo, Justin Timberlake as Sean, Brenda Song as Christie, Armie Hammer as Cameron and Tyler, Max Minghella as Divya, Rashida Jones as Marylin, Joseph Mazzello as Dustin, and Rooney Mara as Erica.<br /><br />The film won three Academy Awards for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score, and Best Film Editing.<br /><br />\\"You don't get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies.\\"berg as Mark, Andrew Garfield as Eduardo, Justin Timberlake as Sean, Brenda Song as Christie, Armie Hammer as Cameron and Tyler, Max Minghella as Divya, Rashida Jones as Marylin, Joseph Mazzello as Dustin, and Rooney Mara as Erica.

I'm 5'8 and started at 150 lbs. I've maintained a diet of 1300-1500 calories per day and after just a week of the DVD (at level 1) I noticed that my body was looking leaner and I could definitely see muscle definition. After completing all 30 days (10 days at each level and healthy eating) I'm down to 140 and I love the way my body looks. This workout will kick your butt, but in the end you will see a more toned, healthier looking you!!! Just stay focused on getting a workout in every day and don't ruin all your hard work by eating badly!!!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Not only was this book interesting and engrossing to read, it changed the way I view my 3 year old son. It brings you so into the mind of a child; and for me as the parent of a small child, there were so many similarities, connections made and new understandings brought on by this book, it's value was immense to me. It's heart wrenching, hand wringing, teary eyed reading. But in a good way. I highly recommend it.
0316010669|3.0|`Blink' is aptly named, as it provided enough entertaining anecdotes to while away a rainy weekend. However, this work falls short of Malcolm Gladwell's more credible treatise, `Outliers,' because its central thrust leans clumsily on psychology, in which the author has no training whatsoever. The result is not particularly cohesive, and Gladwell often comes to fore-head slapping conclusions at times. For example, he cites a psychologist who is able to tell if a marriage is on the brink because he can detect `contempt.' The characters in the story fit the argument too neatly to be credible.<br /><br />The book has repackaged popular psychological ideas (many were explained in Nassim Taleb's `The Black Swan') about intuition but would have been better coming from someone more authoritative. Steven Pinker, perhaps. Half the time, I found myself wanting to read the psychological studies themselves, skipping Gladwell's buckshot summaries of them.<br /><br />However, the chapters closer to the author's own knowledge base are satisfying. In particular, Gladwell draws from a deep well as a former Washington Post reporter to present fascinating insights on various police issues. Those are Blink's best chapters.

B0036EH3U2|5.0|Ok, so the show isn't perfect.  In fact, it stumbles quite a bit during season 4 and it was obvious things needed to be wrapped up before things got too out of control story-wise.      Amazon needs to have what is included in this set on its main page.  You get:  Season 1  Seasons 2 & 2.5  Season 3 + The Resistance Webisodes (10 webisodes chronicling events before Season 3 started totaling 27 min)  Seasons 4 & 4.5  Extended Versions of Razor and The Plan  Hours of bonus featurettes    It would also help to note there are a number of episodes scattered throughout that are extended and were never aired on TV, some by quite a few minutes:  Season 2: Pegasus (not listed how many mins extra)  Season 3: Unfinished Business: The Ronald Moore Version (25 minutes of additional footage - the boxing match episode)                     As mentioned before - 10 Webisodes  Season 4: Razor (16 minutes of additional footage)                     A Disquiet Follows My Soul (8 minutes of additional footage)                     Islanded In A Stream Of Stars (19 minutes of additional footage)                     Daybreak (15 minutes of additional footage.  The Daybreak episode presented here is Daybreak Pts. 1, 2 & 3 combined into one long 2.5 hrs episode)    As for packaging, this set is handled well.  The individual seasons are packaged in glossy cases that you can take out and stand separately or you can just put the big box on your shelf.  Easy to bend the corners of the individual season boxes, but if you're like me and handle with extreme care, there shouldn't be any problems.  All in all, it's a beautiful package, and when taken into account every episode/webisode/extended version/movie/bonus feature that is included, this is the perfect set for true fans.  The bottom of the box says it all: Approx. 69 hrs 31 mins.  Of pure awesomeness.

Feel free to skip if you'd like.<br /><br />Let me preface my review by saying I loved Name of the Wind.<br /><br />Love, love, LOVED it.<br /><br />Name of the Wind is without a doubt the best fantasy novel I've read in the past 15 years (*Edit: That distinction now belongs to Anthony Ryan's Raven Shadow Book I: Blood Song. I highly suggest you check it out.*).  The personal, gripping, intimate nature of getting inside Kvothe's head was a true joy in Kingkiller Book I.<br /><br />As a result, my hopes were incredibly high for the sequel, maybe a little too high. And don't get me wrong, being with Kvothe again was for a time enjoyable, like putting on a comfortable pair of jeans you haven't worn for a while. Believe me, nothing would have pleased me more than for Wise Man's Fear to be a bravura, 5-star outing for Rothfuss.<br /><br />But as much as I wanted to undyingly, unabashedly love this book I just ... couldn't. Rothfuss' genius with prose and demonstrable wit remain intact, but due to some inexplicable plot and character structuring, the Wise Man's Fear simply falls flat. Even worse, however, it subverts our ability to enjoy the epic Story of Kvothe at all.<br /><br />When it's all said and done, a three-word review of Wise Man's Fear could be put down thusly:<br /><br />\\"Huh? What the...?\\"<br /><br />That, in a nutshell, is the experience of reading the second novel of the Kingkiller Chronicles. Though occasionally exhilarating and intriguing, too often The Wise Man's Fear simply leaves you scratching your head. As readers it feels as if we're no longer \\"living\\" in the world Rothfuss creates; instead we're \\"peeking behind the curtain,\\" watching the author pull the strings--\\"Oooh, look how cool this story is! Isn't this story neat? Kvothe's amazing, isn't he amazing?\\"<br /><br />Other reviewers have complained that the biggest problem with Wise Man's Fear is that \\"nothing happens\\" in terms of the\\"big picture\\" of the story. That accusation is accurate, but only a symptom of the broader, overarching problem: Rothfuss' \\"vision for the narrative\\" now overrides the need for a coherent, engaging plot and believable character motivations. The result is not unlike watching a film by a famous director run amok, indulging in personal whims because they know their studio / editor won't get in the way.<br /><br />This sensibility from Rothfuss is baffling, because the Name of the Wind had virtually none of it. If there are two words I would use to describe The Name of the Wind, they would be \\"immersive\\" and \\"organic.\\" From start to finish, you FEEL that you are a part of the world, watching \\"real\\" events happen within it.<br /><br />In Wise Man's Fear, on the other hand, the opposite is true--a pervasive, not-quite-unseen \\"contrived-ness\\" underlies almost everything.<br /><br />Too often Kvothe seems to do things because \\"the story\\" requires it, not because the character himself would be internally motivated to do so. Elements of his psychology are stripped away and tossed by the wayside, with barely an afterthought or explanation. As a result, our emotional connection with Kvothe wanes; we are far less, not more invested in our hero, increasingly ambivalent to whether he succeeds or fails. Kvothe is still \\"the Story,\\" but it's no longer clear whether he's a person or plot device--Kvothe the Character, or Kvothe the Deus Ex Machina.<br /><br />This is not to say that Wise Man's Fear has no redeeming qualities. Rothfuss's prose remains strong as ever: lyrical, subtle, intensely, lovingly crafted. Not all of the plot is wasted either; Kvothe's struggle to earn the respect of his peers, and for himself continues to resonate--when contextualized by the author. Rothfuss seems to forget that we like Kvothe not because he is super-human, but because he is altogether TOO human, and the scenes relating to that struggle--with Devi, Ambrose, the Maer, and up to a point, with Denna--continue to compel. It is in these scenes we come to see ourselves through Kvothe.<br /><br />Sadly, there's not nearly enough of them, and they come so sporadically that pacing and continuity, the book's sense of purpose, suffers. Too often we're asked as readers to suspend belief, plausibility, and authenticity so the author can \\"tell his story the way he wants it told.\\"<br /><br />*** SPOILERS HERE ***<br /><br />The most egregious offense to internal consistency is without question the Felurian sub-plot. Its sole purposes seem to be to heavy-handedly tell the reader, \\"Kvothe is now the most sexually experienced human being in the history of this, or any other world,\\" and to introduce Deus Ex Machina Extraordinaire (there's that phrase again) the Cthaeh. The problems with this section are numerous, and for an author of Rothfuss' stature and formidable talents, it's frankly an embarrassment.<br /><br />\\"Running off to the Faerie realm to discover the undiscoverable\\" is hardly a fresh fantasy trope, but since Rothfuss gives zero context before or after for what transpires, the entire instance feels superfluous, a waste of time. To make matters worse, the handling of the sexual content is eye-rollingly facile at best, and as others have commented, could be construed as outright offensive to women at worst. (As a side note, I just can't figure out Rothfuss's aversion to letting Kvothe remain nuanced. It wasn't enough for him to be a world-class mage, scholar, and musician, but now has to be world's greatest lover as well? Kvothe the Deus Ex, it seems, has to either be the \\"greatest ever,\\" or nothing at all.)<br /><br />\\"Surviving an encounter with Felurian\\" is supposed to be part of Kvothe's mystique, but as a reader it comes across as just straight-up bizarre (and not in a good way). But since Pat hinted at this whole Felurian thing on the cover sleeve of Book 1, um, well, guess we have to do it anyway, no matter how nonsensical and out of character it feels. From start to finish, it's a bad concept horribly executed, and to add insult to injury, it's not even really necessary. Both \\"Kvothe learns to get some\\" and the Cthaeh could have been thrown in just about anywhere--\\"Hey Bast, remember the time I banged Random Chick #77, and then blah blah blah and met the Cthaeh?\\"<br /><br />On the whole I'm a little more forgiving of the Ademre sub-plot--though it also dragged on too long--because at least it arose from the actual in-character development of Kvothe's friendship with Tempi. But even then, the sexual content feels more indulgent than internally motivated by the character, and the effects of Kvothe's time spent with the Ademre are inconsistent with what we see later, during his interactions with the fake Edemah Ruh troop and back at the University.<br /><br />*** END SPOILERS ***<br /><br />In the end, for all of Pat's talent, mind, heart, and wit, as readers we end up questioning his intentions. There's no substantial character growth, plot arc, or sense of how or why any of this actually MATTERS--to Kvothe, or to us.<br /><br />It's a supreme paradox, to see such well-crafted, delicious prose mixed so brutally with a meaningless plot and incoherent character structuring. As much as I love the author, and wanted to gloss over The Wise Man's Fear's significant issues, ultimately I realized that I was no longer invested in the fiction. I simply no longer BELIEVED what I was reading, and the world and Kvothe had ceased to be plausible or compelling.<br /><br />The end result for this reader has been similar to George Lucas' ill-conceived Star Wars prequels: The Wise Man's Fear now taints, rather than enhances, the entire Rothfuss experience.<br /><br />To be sure, if you're a Rothfuss fan, the enduring intrigue of the protagonist and the author's remarkable wit are enough to propel the book to an above-average read. But there's a part of me that thinks, no, KNOWS, that there's a better story in here than the one Pat put to paper. For good or ill, this is clearly the product Pat wanted us to have--and like movie director Baz Luhrmann at his worst, Rothfuss' excesses get in the way of the enjoyment, rather than add to it.
076115678X|5.0|I related to so many of the horror stories of bad haircuts and humid days. I bought the hair products recommended in the book and they do help. I did go out of town to get a dry-hair haircut at a salon that was trained by the Devachan people. It was better than some cuts, but the girl made the same mistake most make on my hair, cutting too many bangs. I have not watched the video yet, but I plan to when it is time for another haircut and I will cut my hair myself. All-in-all the book was extremely helpful and I feel like I am on my way to owning my curls, instead of my curls owning me.
0439813786|5.0|A beautifully envisioned book for children that children love!  I bought a copy as a tool for my husband to entice kids into reading good literature - and it has worked wonders. (He had to put the book away for awhile so he could get through his lessons!)  The illustrations are gorgeous.  This appeals equally to adults  - it's worth having in your collection no matter what your age.
B0015AARJI|4.0|Worked as expected so far. I cannot say anything extra about this product because it either works or not. It is not about an opinion on how much I like it since it is not a game.
0061989142|5.0|I admit, i'm a huge Lauren Conrad fan, her style and personality - the girl next door feel, love it. So I was really excited to see her style book. great information on makeup to what clothes to buy. The makeup section is FANTASTIC. and she shows you how to pull off her signature california hair and tips and tricks along the way.<br /><br />It's a great buy for any style nerd!
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|Boring.  Lifeless.  No plot. Condescending, instead of informative.  Full of info totally unrelated to the plot and story, as if the author is attempting to show what he knows.  What a waste of time reading this.    My last Dan Brown purchase.
1400049628|5.0|The title says it all.  This book is a nice and harmless escape from reality.  The examples are clever, if not hilarious, and the storyline and overall \\"advice\\" allow you to forget about those all too real concerns like mortgages, rent, bills, etc.
B001FB55H6|5.0|Let me begin by saying that before actually viewing the movie in the theater, I never read the graphic novel (but was well aware of how important, different and unique of a superhero story this was), but had friends whom did, and i'm ashamed that I never had the chance to do so myself. That being said, after reading about Zack Snyder's adaptation of Frank Miller's celebrated and critically acclaimed work, when I finally DID see the theatrical release, I was absolutely BLOWN AWAY. I LOVED this film, and it has since become one of my all time favorite films. I love how different it is in comparison to the other \\"comic book\\" adaps. This is a completely different animal. The story was real and poignant, and the \\"alternate history\\" aspect, as well as inclusions of real people (Pat Buchannan, and Lee Iacocca come to mind) really made this a film to go down in history. Faithful to the material, for the very most part, Snyder's visionary and home-hitting directing style, the stellar cast (JACKIE EARLE HALEY, anybody!?) and accurate and well made production was through the roof. Now, on to the Director's Cut of the film, I personally prefer this one to the \\"Ultimate Edition\\" which inserts \\"The Tales of the Black Freighter\\" into the entire film. That animated film, as important as it is to the mythos, is better viewed by itself, again, in my opinion. With this version, I believe you get Zack Snyder's best cut of the film, one that the fans will appreciate it, and get a kick out of the added footage that reminds them of the same parts from the graphic novel. Do yourself a favor, buy this version of Watchmen and be prepared to watch it more times than you should! :)
B003AJKPL2|1.0|The rubber gasket tore the first time I used this olive pitter. I contacted Cuisipro asking what I could do about it; they haven't responded yet.
B00004XPPE|5.0|My first viewing of this film took place on a trans-continental TWA night flight, from LA to NYC, just prior to its being released in 1964.  The occasion for this \\"Sneak Preview\\" was brought about by the fact that the author of the original best selling novel, Eugene Burdick, was also on board this flight and TWA had obtained special permission for its viewing in his honor.  This particular flying experience was memorable for me for two reasons:  one; I was seated in first class next to the actress Jill St. John, who remained wrapped and lifeless in her mink coat until we touched down at Idlewild (JFK) airport, and two; just at the moment in the film when New York City is about to be wiped off the face of the earth by a Russian nuclear weapon, our jet became wrapped in a violent patch of air turbulence, which in no small way contributed to the events taking place in the film at that moment when the city is being obliterated in a blinding flash of light.<br /><br />This film holds up quite well and still provides a thought-provoking and nail-biting experience - even without the turbulence.  The acting and overall production values are excellent and the black and white format only adds to the feeling of doom and desparation.  This early Sidney Lumet directorial  effort is a perfectly realized depiction of the events portrayed in the book this film is based on.  Highly recommended.
B002ZG980U|1.0|Although I usually like Leonardo in films, I was not to thrilled with this movie...could not follow...maybe it was me
B000TEUSJK|2.0|First off, I must admit that I have been intrigued and tantalized for many years by all of the scandalous hype that has surrounded this film - particularly the lewd and lascivious scorn heaped upon it by many of its critics.  By and large, I must say that I find myself agreeing with much that has been said.  If you enjoy viewing scenes of wicked and evil debauchery, this might well be a cup of tea to please your taste buds.  It most definitely is not mine.
B004DTLK8A|3.0|I love this band but this is probably one of my least fav. from them. the album prior (Polaris) is better. not horrible or anything, just a little tired. maybe it just needs to grow on me.
0312370849|5.0|I read this book in one day...I could not put it down.  My sister recommended it to me and I'm glad she did.  I don't understand the bad reviews.  Sarah's story was heartrending, and it brought to mind all the horrors that must have been endured by children of the Holocaust.  Some books are unforgettable and this is definitely one of them.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|If there is one thing that I hate to do is spend money on a book, and then end up hating the book.  So I try to do my due diligence before purchasing a book by asking friends and/or reading reviews from customers and critics. I was really looking forward to reading this book after reading all of the great reviews.  After finally finishing A Discovery of Witches, I have to wonder if I read the same book that all the people giving it great reviews read? The book started out pretty well, but it progressively got more and more tedious.  WAY too many details: I don't need to know the exact menu for every meal, I don't need to know how much was eaten at that meal, I don't need to be reminded over and over what someone/something smells like, I don't care what kind of tea or wine was consumed, etc. As the book dragged on, the additional characters and scenarios became more and more absurd.  I found myself not caring what happened anymore, I just wanted to finish the book. And then when I finally did finish...What?!!! Are you kidding me?  I read this WHOLE BOOK for that? This book is obviously the first in what is going to be who knows how many more.  I wish I had known that before I bought it.  There is no way that I will force myself read another one of these books.     For my first Kindle purchase, this was a MAJOR let down.
B001AQIYJC|1.0|This movie is absurdly depressing.  Maybe if you had some horrible event in your life this would make you feel like it wasn't so bad.  I don't mind a sad movie but there needs to be some redemption, or hope, or something for christ sake.  If you want an all star depressing weekend, watch this and million dollar baby, then maybe \\"what dreams may come.\\"    Jeeash.  4 star average?
B002ZG980U|2.0|Last night we watched Alice in Wonderland and thought it was so weird.  Today we watched Inception and thought it made Alice look real by comparison!  And enough gratuitous violence to make a James Bond movie look like a child's bedtime story!
0786915749|2.0|This is one of the worst fantasy novels that I actually finished. Here's why:    DERIVATIVE:    I don't know what's all the hype and fuss about Raistlin. He's simply a version of Moorcock's ELRIC OF MELNIBONE--a character who predates Raistlin by about a decade. Both are gifted with amazing powers but are also plagued by physical limitations.     The scene where Tas manipulates the fake dragon reminded me of the movie THE WIZARD OF OZ.    The scene where the characters are transported cross-country by the pegasi is comparable to the scene where the Eagles transport characters in THE LORD OF THE RINGS and THE HOBBIT. Also comparable are the times that characters \\"die\\" only to be resurrected--but in this book characters \\"die\\" and come back in the short span of one chapter.    Bupu's command of language is on a level with TARZAN (Me Tarzan. You Jane).    In general, the whole book reads like a combination of bad pulp fiction and the script for an old HE-MAN cartoon.    RIDICULOUS NAMES:    These names speak for themselves . . .    VERMINAARD  BUPU  HIGHBULP PHUDGE I  FISTANDANTILUS  CATYRPELIUS    Seriously?!?!?    CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT:    The very first page in the paperback edition of this book shows a nice list of 8 characters, each with their own past histories and characteristics. I actually was looking forward to reading about some of these. Characters like Tanis had enormous potential.    Unfortunately, the further I read, the more I realized something:  The characters hardly ever change!  Tanis, Sturm, Goldmoon, Riverwind, Caramon, Flint and Tasslehoff--all these characters stay pretty much the same. We see a brief moment of compassion in Raistlin and a bit of a change in Laurana, but that's all.    So why is the character development so poor? Read on . . .    TOO MUCH ACTION:    If you break this novel down, it's basically 90% action and 10% everything else, which includes character development. So much action is taking place that the characters scarcely havea CHANCE to sit back, take it easy and reflect on what has happened and how it might have changed them and their relationship with the others. There virtually no introspection and I don't even recall the characters ever THINKING. All their actions are in plain view.    Furthermore, the MOTIVE for the Dark Queen wanting to take over the world is never really explained. But I guess with names like Dark Queen and Verminaard the authors felt like they didn't have to justify their motives--they're the bad guys, boo them and cheer the good guys. Reading this whole book I never had a sense of DIRECTION as to what the characters where trying to accomplish and more importantly, WHY?    OVERALL:    Even if we wound the clock back to 1984, there still isn't much to recommend this book. Back then I would rather be reading ROBERT E. HOWARD, HP LOVECRAFT, MICHAEL MOORCOCK, JRR TOLKIEN, GENE WOLFE and JOHN MYERS MYERS, to name a few.    But it's not 1984, it's 2011.   Do yourself a favor and read some of the above and then add GEORGE RR MARTIN, CHINA MIEVILLE, ROBERT JORDAN, GUY GAVRIEL KAY, BRANDON SANDERSON, JIM BUTCHER, TERRY PRATCHETT and many other authors that can write books that put this one to absolute shame.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|This book was great and I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it.  It was spellbounding and held my interest.  Love his books!
B002K0WBY6|5.0|Of course this is not the first time this premise has been made into a film.  Regardless I fell hopelessly in love with Andrew and Margaret.  Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock really sparkled on screen together, great chemistry.  The tables are turned by the end of the movie.  Margaret the tough emotinonless lady chief editor who gets schooled not only by Andrew but by Andrew's family and friends.  Denis O'Hare who played Mr. Gilbertson and Osar Nunez who played Ramon made me chuckle a few times.   And what can I say about Betty White!  She's fantastic as \\"Gammie.\\"      There were many great laughs along with some tender moments, I highly recommend for those hopeless romantics like myself.    And of course Ryan is very easy on the eyes...
B0014NDXGA|5.0|Been using this a month or so and love it.  Small/ compact (which means a lot), easy to read and just accurate as any other model out there... with a much better price!
B003XCVQ3C|5.0|I use this along with a henge dock with my macbook pro to connect to my home theater setup.    It works perfectly!    I searched for a long time to find out if you can run sound and video with one cable out o a macbook pro.  I found that as long as you have a more recent macbook (maybe 2010 or newer?) it will work.  The other question is if it is possible to output multi-channel surround sound via the display port connection and I'm happy to report that it is.  You will not get true surround, but it is possible to have the output mixed down to dolby and then your receiver can decode it.  From what I've found this seems to be the only way.
B004DMIIOG|5.0|This is one of the best that I've watched. And I've been around a while now. Seen a lot of movies/anime. You'll probably be burnt out emotionally by the end of this one.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|All I have to say is that this is one of my favorite games for the DS of all time. Here are some things to note:    1. The heart of this game lies in the story, not the gameplay.    2. If you enjoyed Battle Royale, you'll LOVE this.    3. The gameplay is very similar to the Phoenix Wright games.    4. The story is really really good!
B0049OSQ18|5.0|I understand what The Decemberists fans like about their music.  This is moving, crafted song writing and lyrics.  I have my past favorites, including The Crane Wife.  Maybe the one thing that wasn't my favorite in the past was at times a song would drone on for a bit or lose its energy.  And yes a slow song or down tempo song can have plenty of energy.  On The King is Dead the band just comes at you the whole time.  This is my favorite Decemberists effort just for that reason.  The band set out to write songs that were distilled to only what was necessary.  For me it works.  I like long songs as much as anybody, as long as it is not long for the sake of being long.  This cd feels great from song to song.  This cd is what I thought this band was always capable of and now it has been realized.
B003L20ID8|4.0|A young political figure has a couple of chance meetings with a woman, and suddenly sees a mysterious group of men trying to keep them from being together. He tries to understand who these people are, and why they want to keep the two apart. The film is an intriguing mystery, with the questions answered before the film ends. Well acted, with good chemistry between the leads, the mystery of what is occurring is very engrossing. The story line avoids being so complex that the viewer loses interest in the outcome, keeping the audience in rapt attention. Very well done.
B000H6SXMY|3.0|The DVD's look like fake, at least the print on them and the box but video quality is alright. No complaints on the delivery.
0307463745|1.0|Mostly, the authors should consider adding some actual CONTENT. This book was a huge disappointment, and I feel mislead (or duped, I guess) by the eye-catching ads for it that seemed to be in every magazine I picked up. (Kudos to the ad agency working for Crown publishing!)<br /><br />I was unable to finish this flabby piece of so-called business writing, being hugely  distracted by the silly and fairly crude full-page drawings. I tried very hard to ignore them, even to placing a white sheet of paper over each one in order to focus on the actual written content, only to find that... it wasn't there! Now that I think about it, these... drawings?... diagrams?... charts? ... post-its? are probably doing the job they were intended to do.<br /><br />Because I foolishly purchased it in hardcover I now have a large heavy object of which I need to dispose.<br /><br />In  summary, my evaluation of REWORK  is summed up by the illustration on its cover: garbage.
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|This is not an academy-award winner, but it was fun to watch. My fiance and I were pleasantly surprised. Funny and romantic, it was worth watching just to enjoy the beautiful people and places. Worth renting if you're in a light mood and want to relax.
B00275EHJG|5.0|This is a terrific movie for the whole family all ages!  Glad I decided to buy it.  My son was still two when the film was at the theaters.  He's three now and can enjoy bites and pieces of a movie.  This is one that I can see and hear over and over again (which I will) and not grow too tire of it too soon.  He loves the dinosaur and the action scenes.  What a classic!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Love the movie and the effects are even more amazing in Blu-ray.  As per the item desciption the box set was delivered in new condition ... very happy!  Anyone who loves science fiction, plenty of action and a great Aussie actor will very much enjoy this film.  Also a great movie for kids. My children aged 8 and 11 thought the movie was great.
B000TGJ80S|5.0|I've seen many versions of \\"Dracula\\", but this by far is the scariest.<br />The music is spine-chilling, the special effects are life-like.<br />Gary Oldman & Anthony Hopkins steal the show.<br /><br />I kind of liked the Vampire-babes too.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|I think this was the first book I've ever read by Stephen King, and I still recommend it all the time when people ask me about a good read. It's definitely scary, but definitely amazing. When I was younger, maybe around 5, my sister had me watch the movie (cruel, it was, at 5). I was terrified for a long time after that. I wouldn't go to the bathroom alone. Then, when I was about 17 I read the book. I was scared again (not as badly, of course)and would eye the drains when I was near them.    It is written amazingly and you will feel connected with the characters.     100% worth reading.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|I was 14 when Secretariat won the triple crown, and I knew about it but didn't see any of the races. I found this movie a great look back at the era. Diane Lane and John Malkovich both did a superb job with their roles, and the story telling also was very effective.<br /><br />My dad mentioned that this movie seemed to have a feminist angle. I'm not sure I agree. True, it deals with a woman entering into a male dominated world -- this world being horse racing. But I did not pick up a \\"I am woman, hear me roar\\" tone. Rather, I see her surrounding herself with people -- men -- who knew what they were doing, listening to their input, and being man ... I mean woman ... enough to apologize when in error.<br /><br />This movie is rated with a straight PG. I always say that parents should watch every movie with their children. In this case, I think this movie gives parents opportunity to, after the movie, discuss the lessons that come out in the story.<br /><br />One bit of trivia. Scott Glenn plays the father of the main character, and former Senator and Presidential candidate Fred Thompson portrays his best friend. Do you know what other movie these two actors shared a scene in? You might have to do some HUNTing FOR this movie; it may be on the RED shelf this OCTOBER.
B000LXH0AE|1.0|this was a really LAME movie.  even with \\"the queen\\" in it it stunk.  the movie was in great shape but the plot sucked!!!!!!!
0439023521|5.0|this series is one of those books that literally stays with you everyday of your life. i cant view anything in the same way as i used to after this book. im currently finishing up the third book in the trilogy, but i want everybody to know, that these books are the first to compel an actual amazon.com review out of me. ive read that the first book is terrifying, and it is, that the second book doesnt disappoint as the middle of a trilogy and it doesnt. just read them, seriously. i dont know what else to sayl
0684833395|4.0|I completed this book, only on my third read.First two times I couldn't go beyond 15 pages (when I was much younger),I found the character and situational buildup unconventional and difficult to comprehend.Finally I managed to cross the chasm  and only to be engulfed by Joseph Heller's Brilliance.It is the one of the best satire of all times , every line looks seemingly innocent but has so much to say.The pragmatism of life and senselessness of war could not have been potrayed better.
B004I2K4E8|4.0|Different casts have different interpretations - that's just how it is. I've seen 5 different casts in full productions, have the original London and Broadway cast recordings, as well as the \\"complete symphonic\\" recording (my personal favorite), and the 10th anniversary edition - and now this one.  I enjoy all of them for different reasons, and my personal \\"dream cast\\" would be a mix from all of the above.  There is one individual performance that I will comment on because everyone else has, and that is Nick Jonas.  Personally, I liked his reading of the part. Going as far back as the novel, Marius is the young innocent schoolboy who got caught up with the fanatics of the ABC Club (i.e. the other students). Jonas' youth coupled with his admittedly low-power voice gave Marious a sense of vulnerability that is frequently lacking in this belt-fest of a score. One other musical note is that I agree with the previous post about the poorly mixed \\"One Day More\\".  This is one of the most amazing ensemble pieces ever written for the musical stage, but it only works if all the voices are balanced.  The \\"complete symphonic\\" recording is the only one that seems to have gotten this right.    My four-star rating comes from the fact that once again the producers cut portions of the score.  It was \\"more complete\\" than the markedly trimmed 10th anniversary concert, but still... To go to all of the expense to put this concert together, why not do it completely unedited to have a video record of the full score?  Of course, better yet, why not record an actual stage performance and make it available on video? In some respects, the 10th anniversary was superior in that it at least had videos of stage performances displayed in certain crucial scenes. One of the most powerful images from the modern musical stage comes during the \\"Bring Him Home\\" instrumental when the barricade revolves to reveal all of the dead students and the fallen flag.  Close-ups of the orchestra just don't do this justice.    But all that said, the technical brilliance of this recording will keep me coming back for many more viewings...
B001EYU1VO|5.0|Actually I got a upgraded version without notice.When I opened the package, it turned to be a Cyborg F.L.Y. 5.This is really a good joysitck for flight simulator. Not too complicated as Satitek X52, nor too simple. I'm a beginner of FSX, and this makes a huge difference compared with mouse or keyboard.Flying is much more complex than racing, after all it's really good.    BTW, I am in Canada, and this is a great deliver.
B003Y5H542|5.0|\\"Rango\\" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Rango is a sheltered chameleon living as an ordinary family pet facing a major identity crisis. After all, how high can you aim when your whole purpose in life is to blend in? When Rango accidentally winds up in the gritty, gun-slinging town of Dirt -- a lawless outpost populated by the desert's most wily and whimsical creatures -- the less-than-courageous lizard suddenly finds he stands out. Welcomed as the last hope the town has been waiting for, new Sheriff Rango is forced to play his new role to the hilt... until he starts to become the hero he once only pretended to be.    The voice cast led by Johnny Depp (terrific as Rango / Lars) is excellent! The directing by Gore Verbinski (also produced and co-wrote the story) (who also directed Depp in the first three \\"Pirates Of The Caribbean\\" movies (2003: Curse Of The Black Pearl), (2006: Dead Man's Chest) & (2007: At World's End), he also directed \\"The Ring\\" (2002), \\"The Mexican\\" (2001), \\"The Weather Man\\" (2005) & \\"Mouse Hunt\\" (1997) is excellent!

This is an excellent animated film that is different from most of them being made right now. This is a funny and exciting movie that will keep you thinking and laughing at the same time. Johnny Depp gives a terrific vocal and 'emotional' (emotion capture) performance that is one of his best performances and characters that he has done, belonging alongside Jack Sparrow & Sweeney Todd. This is one of the best movies of the new year and feels like it could be a Oscar nominee next year for Best Animated Feature.
B0034G4OUO|4.0|FASTER seems from the PR and the graphics to be just another action flick. But this film as written by Tony and Joe Gayton and directed by George Tillman, Jr. proves to be more.  At the core of this story is the way revenge eats at the soul and almost makes a good man bad.<br /><br />Driver (Dwayne Johnson in a fine brooding role more dependent on physicality than words) is released from ten years in prison for his involvement in a double-crossed heist during which his brother was killed: Driver has only one thing on his mind and that is to track down and kill all those involved in the murder. Seemingly without feeling he manages to kill some of those on the list, a trend the Cop (Billy Bob Thornton, an addict just weeks away from retirement) and Cicero (Carla Gugino), his boss, begin to trace.  One of the designated conspirators hires hit man Killer (Oliver Jackson-Cohen, an actor with fine screen presence to watch carefully) to kill Driver. Clues are added and the chase becomes more frantic as Driver slowly murders his brother's killers.  But compassion and insight enter Driver's persona and his path is deviated by some victims' pleas.  The ending is well written and is a surprise in every way.<br /><br />Johnson has become so muscular as to distort his presence, but that is likely a preparation for this role: he is convincing in a role with very little lines.  Thornton contributes his usual excellent skills to his multifaceted role and Moon Bloodgood is outstanding as his long-suffering addict wife.  There are cameos for fine actors such as Mike Epps, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as an tent revival evangelist, Tom Berenger as the prison warden, Maggie Grace as Killer's girlfriend, and Annie Corley as Driver's mother. But keep an eye on Oliver Jackson-Cohen - he shows considerable promise. FASTER is fast, to the point, minimalist film making that swiftly drives to a surprising finish.  Grady Harp, March 11
B003VS0CX8|5.0|The Sound of Music may be the best pure musical ever put on film. The scenery is majestic, the acting is excellent, and the singing is magnificent. It is a film that cried out to be published on blu ray, and thankfully that has finally happened.<br /><br />If you don't know the story, I'm not sure how you've remained in the dark about it for this long. LOL The quality of the movie and all its elements are well known, so I'm going straight to the details of the blu ray:<br /><br />I am happy to report that this is a criterion blu ray release. We've never heard this music with the detail and strength produced by the sound track on this release. It is pure. Watch out for the whistles sequence, it might split your ears. LOL<br /><br />The Sound of Music's picture at times shows a bit of grain from the original large format film print, but that does not detract from the film. You literally won't want to miss watching any scene. It reminds me of watching HD images for the first time all over again ... in other words, now that I'm used to HD, this seemed yet another step up in picture quality. It really is that much head and shoulders above most other blu ray presentations. The gold script credits at the beginning of the film look like they are in 3D. Individual blades of grass and the rough weave of Maria's jacket are displayed in full detail. Everything in the film looks like you could reach out and touch it ... run your fingers across the screen and feel the textures.<br /><br />In short, if you enjoy this film, have blu ray, but don't yet have this movie, get it now. You won't be disappointed.
0307593525|5.0|Bought this set for my Godmother and she loves it.  I can not really specify as to what is mentioned in the books, but I know my Godmother is extremely happy with it.
B004EQAVHI|5.0|I thought this movie was excellent.  Cinematically it was beautiful and the movie had great acting.  I find it ironic how so many people disliked the movie because of how passive the students were about living.  When in reality this type of stuff is happening everyday in real life.  People are being manipulated, led like sheep and brainwashed by the higher ups and media continuosly and don't even know it! Then watch this movie and wonder how could something like this happen...Truly Sad
B002I9Z8DK|3.0|I just purchased a blu-ray, and, the first movies I bought where the Star Trek films. I think that the transfer is good, but, of all six movie in the box set, the only movie that did not skip, or, stick, was Star Trek 4. I found the sticking and skipping to be very uncalled for. I was also unhappy, that, Star Trek 1, 2 and 6 where the original versions of the film. I feel that extended versions are much better and for the price I paid for the set, they should both be included. I found the features to be fun, for the most part. I woul dhave liked to see more behind the scenes stuff, and, promos and hard to find interviews. This is Paramount, and, they have access to anything and everything Trek. To put over three hours of features on a disc, for the sake of doing it, does not make it better. I feel the the blu0ray version of Star Trek (2009) had far better extras than this box set.
B0042RJWTC|2.0|Was Henry VIII so quiet and unassuming, was his life so staid and predictable that U.S. audiences would never sit through a series based on his exploits? The people who brought us 'The Tudors' certainly thought so.  The Irish/Canadian production team took one look at Henry, his court, his wives, his wars and his battles with the Church--and his impact on world history, culture, art, literature, politics, religion, geography and music and said, \\"How the heck can we make this guy's life sound interesting?\\"<br /><br />'The Tudors' plays so fast and loose with history that even someone with my minimal knowledge had to constantly point at the screen and hoot.  But hey, it's TV, so let's not nitpick. The episodes are colorful and entertaining and we are, after all, just Americans.  Why give us content when all we want is 'shiny.'<br /><br />The series goes off the rails from the gitgo. Here's what one might learn from Season One:  The Boleyn family was apparently unaware of the existence of printed books (which had been introduced about one hundred years earlier). It took Cromwell to explain the concept of a printing press to a mystified George B.  Princess Mary, Henry's sister is combined with Lady Mary, his eldest daughter. The producers no doubt decided anyone with the monicker \\"Bloody Mary\\" was the money Mary. With Henry's penchant for marrying Catherines/Katherines, Annes and Janes, they must have assumed that we'd never handle a pair of Marys and decided to spare us the additional confusion. You have to respect that kind of consideration for viewers.<br /><br />The series shows Wolsey committing suicide in prison after being tried and found guilty of treason. Big deal. So the man died of natural causes before the trial, but, hey nonny nonny, it's close enough for madrigals.  And at least they don't have the poor Cardinal  doing an Isadora Duncan dance routine in his his cell -- which is how little Cathy Howard spends her last, precious moments.<br /><br />The people and the props seem to be plucked from a generic \\"Costume Drama: Days of Old When Knights Were Bold Period\\" warehouse.  The anachronisms are egregious and occur in scene after scene, episode after episode.  People travel in carriages, Henry fires a flintlock musket and admires the Venus de Milo. Most of the historical OUCH moments are pretty obvious, and I'll bet a truly knowledgeable person's head would explode from recognizing the details I missed.<br /><br />Okay, the BBC would never perpetrate this kind of fraud upon its public, but 'The Tudors' was made for Americans, and let's face it, we have never let facts mess up our own history.  Our own beloved President Reagan said 'facts are foolish things.\\"  We believe them impedimentary and unnecessary if they interfere with a good story--just take a look at the 5 Star reviews for this series.  Many completely dismiss the need to present history without distortion.  Accuracy is something that interferes with the plot and adds nothing.  One even believes that until this TV show came along, poor Henry was known \\"throughout history\\" only as a crude barbarian who tossed chicken bones over his shoulder.  The mini-series finally pulled the curtain of obscurity aside and it is her hope that, because of The Tudors, history will no longer ignore Henry. Moreover, she believes it will alert future generations to the fact that he was a hottie. Maybe the producers of this series weren't so far off the mark when assessing their audience.<br /><br />If you want a mishmash of soap opera plots, lavish (if historically muddled) costumes, and overacting, if you like to pretend you are watching something culturally enlightening and educational when merely viewing a telenovela in drag, this series is made to order.  And to set the record straight, I have at least two toes in this camp, if not the whole foot, so I had to give it that second star.  Watch it for the bright colors, the passionate embraces, the whole romance novel nonsense. Just don't pretend it's anything but a Goo Goo Cluster.<br /><br />(I understand Michael Hirst, who created 'The Tudors,' is planning a series on Vlad the Impaler--if he can figure out a way to add some sex and violence to the story of that kindly and courtly old statesman.)nderstand Michael Hirst, who created 'The Tudors,' is planning a series on Vlad the Impaler--if he can figure out a way to add some sex and violence to the story of that kindly and courtly old statesman.)
0756404738|5.0|Since i read \\"Name of the Wind\\", i have been waiting for this book. Then it arrived on the evening before a big presentation. Rarely in my life, i have been so tempted.     I finished the book on Sunday and it even exceeded my expectations. Patrick Rothfuss is IMHO the best current fantasy author. A truly intriguing story combined with superb mastery of language makes it unique in it's class. Even for people who are not addicted to Fantasy will love it.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I have watched this via the original version in the past and always thought it looked dated, even though it was not that old.  This makes the production look and feel much better.  Propbably not worth getting if you already own it, but otherwise it is definitely worth getting as a firt time purchase.  It's not 100% faithful to the book, but it's as close as you'll get, and great it is truly fun to watch.
0345457692|2.0|Having seen many good reviews of this book, I bought it for my wife, a mystery fan who's always on the lookout for new writers. She never got around to it, so I gave it a read. I'm very, very glad she did not waste her time on it.    I've read a lot of cyberpunk, and I know mysteries, both noir-ish and otherwise, pretty well, too. I'm open to new approaches that any genre might take -- in fact, I have a soft spot for mash-ups. However, Altered Carbon fails as a good noir thriller, a good cyberpunk novel, or a combination that somehow becomes greater than the sum of its separate genre components.    First, it's hard, as a long-time SF reader, to take seriously a book that starts with a troubled premise. While Morgan does depict some interesting and often credible repercussions of the \\"sleeving\\" technology that's the centerpiece of the book, he overlooks one major problem: Any instance of human consciousness is still a person. The book treats death, as long as you've been recorded and then recopied into another body, as meaningless. However, for the person (and a copy is a real person), death is as horrible as it always was.    Imagine you're sitting in a comfortable chair, and an exact copy of you walks into the room, gun drawn. The copy says, \\"I can give you 100% assurance that every aspect of your mind is perfectly re-created in me. In fact, I'll even remember everything that happens up to the point of me shooting you.\\" Your reaction won't be, \\"Fine, kill me.\\" The thinking, conscious, living creature you are will fight to defend itself, regardless of how good the copy is.    There are other problems with the thesis, such as the research in the last two decades that reveals how much our minds are tied into our bodies, in ways that makes it harder to imagine copying our minds as easily as making a ghost copy of a hard drive. But, science aside, Altered Carbon has lots of other problems.    Flat characters, including the main character. A parade of hot women who can'twait to sleep with the main character. The main character's solution of the mystery through leaps of logic. Boring scenes that add little to the story. (Drug trips, for example, are always boring in the re-telling.) Violence porn of an extreme variety. Expectations that we'll stick with the main character, even when he guns down people who, in his own telling, are just doing their jobs. Plot developments that, rather than being \\"seamless\\" (a favorite word of positive reviews here), are forced and clumsy. Read some of the other negative reviews for other serious problems.    In the end, the book gives itself away in the \\"About the author\\" blurb, which brags that the author has optioned the film rights for the book. Who cares? Why add that, other than to tell us how impressed we're supposed to be? Morgan clearly has had good marketing, and no small amount of luck, to get all the good press this book has received. There are far better books in both genres, and even SF mysteries (The Demolished Man, for starters), so I recommend giving them a try.
B003INBNXO|5.0|I really liked this movie, from start to finish, I couldn't stop watching.  What most of this genre of movie lacks, is a good story line, not true with this movie.  Great story line from beginning to end, it really gets you involved with the characters, and has you rooting for the good guys.  I'm glad they were not as graphic in the movie, or depicted how japan really treated the Chinese when they invaded; I think that would have put the movie on another level, and I am glad they gave you just enough oppression as to fuel your hatred as much as the main characters.  I rented this twice before buying it, and this movie never fails to deliver what every action movie should have (story & butt kicking lol).    Donnie Yen has to be one of my favorite actors in this genre, and really recommend picking this one up.
0756404738|5.0|If you liked the first book in the series, you will like this one as well. Rothfuss is a master storyteller.  Recommend you read the series in order. Already salivating for the next one!

1400032717|3.0|Mark Haddon's \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time\\" is a fresh, poignant coming-of-age novel with a most unusual protagonist - a fifteen year old autistic boy.    Christopher Boone is like one of the mathematical puzzles he delights in. The workings of his mind will be baffling to most people. Unusually bright with a proclivity for math and logic, his autism renders him blind and tone deaf when it comes to emotion - unable to fathom the complex nuances in social behavior that form the substratum of human relationships. Like his hero, Sherlock Holmes, his is an intensely analytical and deductive mind. However, we live in a world that often flies in the face of logic.    Determined to solve the mystery of his neighbor's `murdered' dog, Christopher sets about finding clues, only to stumble upon a secret in his own family that unnerves him, and to discover a truth that he finds terrifying. This sends him on a journey that, for one with his particular disorder, tests the boundaries of his considerable courage and resilience.    This is a book that effortlessly held my attention from beginning to end. The few characters who people this narrative are wonderfully depicted. As seen from Christopher's dispassionate viewpoint, they come across as fallible, but moving, in their all too human inadequacies. The most compelling of them, is of course, Christopher, who defies our pity, and emerges from his trial, truly heroic.    Mark Haddon's language and style is pitch perfect to the needs of this story, its tone catching the eccentricities of its literal-minded narrator, and faithfully echoing the other characters. The prime-numbered chapters prove to be more than a gimmicky distraction, giving us a window into the mind of Christopher, as do the many pictorial images, puzzles and diagrams. We never lose sight of the fact that we are in the presence of a very unusual and beautiful mind.    \\"Mother used to say that Christopher was a nice name because it was a story about being kind and helpful, but I do not want my name to be a story about being kind and helpful. I want my name to mean me.\\"    The author desrves commendation for keeping this story unflinchingly true to the paradox of Christopher's character.
0756404738|2.0|The middle installment of a trilogy is often a letdown.  For those of you old enough to remember, I could sum up the experience of reading \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\" simply by referencing \\"The Empire Strikes Back.\\"  Other reviewers have already discussed how many dead ends there are to the plot; characters appear who seem to promise an exciting new plot development, but then they simply get left behind and the plot does not move along at all. Instead, Rothfuss keeps back-tracking, picking up from where the plot was a few chapters ago, and then heading for another dead end.  If Rothfuss intends to weave all or even most of those loose threads together in Book Three, he's going to need more than 1,000 pages, and he should have used some of THESE 1,000 pages to do it.    Others have also correctly noted that you have to get through 200 pages to learn simply that Kvothe now knows how to swing a sword, or swing with the ladies.  To make space for all this side-tracking, he cut down new information about the Chandrian to a single page.  Meanwhile, a gratuitous new vilain is introduced (in about 3 pages. This monster apparently has no connection to the Chandrian or their plan.  What is that Chandrian plan, or did it ever matter? Book I repeated a children's chant, \\"Chandrian - what's their plan?\\" I thought it was pointing to something, but not so far.    For me, the roughly 300 pages devoted to Kvothe's new sexual abilities was nothing but embarrassing.  They are too frankly spoken for the usual tween fantasy audience (I am not recommending this book to my son), and yet too childish to be credibly voiced by a character who is sexual experienced.  Really, the day after a hotblooded young man finishes several months of non-stop dalliance with an expert sexual athlete, is he going to get all stirred up by a flash of boobie?  Does anybody still believe that sexual expertise is a book-subject to be learned and transferered across the entire female species?  This part of the book flashed me back to those awful mid-60s movies, with Dean Martin as Matt Helm, or James Coburn as Flint, where bikini-clad stock characters fall into the main character's sexual thrall at a blink.  As far as I know, mature women demand sustained interest before they invite you into the bedroom, and display a diversity of preference once they meet you there.  The sexuality of the middle part of the book was either puerile or chauvinist - not sure I care enough to figure out which, because I don't like either.    Worst of all, the character of Kvothe himself is inconsistently changed according to the the experiences he has in \\"The Wise Man's Fear.\\"  On the one hand, his time in fairyland makes him an expert ladies' man.  On the other, two months of boot camp on controlling his emoitions and actions teaches him nothing.  He is forced into a group of highly disciplined martial artists, must watch his every word and action to avoid offending them, and then the day he returns to his own he civilization, he resumes reckless actions.  He will risk his lifelong mission for any transitory pleasure - speaking his mind, defending his tribal honor, whatever.  Of course, since these episodes are crammed into four months' time, maybe it's reasonable that they have scant impact on the qualities of Kvothe's character.  If I could suggest a subtitle, I'd name Book II: \\"The Wise Man's Fear: Kvothe's Semester Abroad.\\"    Like J.K. Rowling before him, Rothfuss has filled his middle book with, um, filler.  I am willing to put money on it: when we get to read Book III in another four or five years, we'll be forced to acknowledge that this middle volume could have been omitted altogether.  There are lots of fun moments in Book II, but it's more like a quality fanfic compendium, providing 50 fun short stories about Kvothe, than the authoritative second novel that I had hoped for.
B004I2K4DY|4.0|Granted, there are several stunning moments by this cast, most notably when Alfie Boe brings down the house with his version of \\"Bring Him Home\\" and again when Boe,Colm Wilkinson and two current Jean ValJeans sing that song together.    But the main fly in the ointment was the miscasting of pop singer Nick Jonas as Marius...a gaffe made all the more obvious when Michael Ball, a stellar Marius in the show's earlier days (including the 10th anniversary), made an appearance during the delightful encore and reminded everyone what Marius' voice SHOULD sound like.
B002O5M4SA|5.0|This is really a must see movie. The quality of the blu-ray is what one would expect and I felt they did a great job with the picture and sound. The story of The Professional is one that is very moving. Without providing any spoilers, I will say that at the heart of the movie is the interactions of a professional hit man and a young girl. Their interactions are both funny and serious. In my opinion, this is one of Natalie Portman's best works. It's amazing that she performed the acting at such a young age. This is not a violence-centered movie, although there is some violence. This movie is about relationships when you get down to it. And the relationship between Leon and Matilda is reminiscent of an older brother and his younger sister. Leon the Professional is a great movie, it's a classic!
B003SBZZKS|3.0|For better or worse, certain things have come to define America - its foreign policy, Coco Cola, McDonald's, Hollywood Movies, and of course, Music. Few things are more quintessentially American than Elvis, Rock and Roll, Jazz, Blues, Rap...the list goes on.                Most of the main characters in Jennifer Egan's captivating novel have connections to the music industry. The other thing they have in common is connection to one another. The world depicted in `A Visit from the Goon Squad' is a small one, despite occasionally zigzagging across different continents, and careening boldly over diverse time-periods of the protagonists' lives. Chance encounters and random characters traipse through the story, creating ripple effects where one person is separated from another only by a few degrees of difference.                The two main connecting links are introduced early in the novel. There's a friable quality to the troubled Sasha who leaves an indelible imprint at the first meeting. She has worked for twelve years for Bennie Salazar, ex punk-rocker and more recently, record executive for `Sow's Ear Records'. Unlike the intriguing Sasha, Bennie makes a far less favorable impression. He is wallowing in a warm bath of shameful memories and private humiliations, and the unsuspecting reader is deluged by wave after wave of squirm-inducing recollections. Sasha and Bennie, each in their own way, are seeking deliverance, mostly from themselves. On them, as on everyone else in this novel, Time works its mysterious, ineluctable alchemy.                Egan's nimble, innovative story-telling effortlessly spears our attention from the get-go. Her vivid vignettes anchor the ensemble of characters, so that each feels like a crucial piece of a jigsaw puzzle, rather than a mere cameo appearance. As their individual lives converge, diverge, and overlap onto each other's, together, they form a richly colorful montage of different experiences and perspectives.
0307463745|2.0|I bought this book because of the reviews by the likes of Chris Anderson (The Long Tail) and Mark Cuban: \\"If given a choice between investing in someone who has read \\"Rework\\" or has his MBA, I'm investing in \\"Rework\\" every time...\\" Really? It took me about  an hour and a half to read this book (1 1/2-spaced paragraphs, wide margins, two-page chapters, split up by full-page drawings). Probably took a weekend to write. One of the first chapters is \\"Planning is guessing\\". Eight paragraphs. The advice: \\"Stop worrying about (business plans) as much. They just aren't worth the stress... It's okay to wing it.\\" That's it? I bought a $20 hardback book for that? Meanwhile, \\"Inc\\" magazine has an article I was reading about the same time (Feb 2011 issue) that actually discussed the topic -- the difference between entrepreneurs and corporate people -- between those who take risks and those who want to plan and test everything. Here's a quote from the Inc article: \\"My market research would actually be hands-on actual selling.\\" So much more interesting and useful than this book.    It just reads like a high-school term paper scribbled together the night before, on a subject and point of view that deserves better.
0307463745|1.0|I wanted to like this book...but absolutely did not.  It's filled with hype, baseless claims, and sensationalism.  It's hype without credibility, sizzle without the steak, a race car without an engine...you get the picture.      While there's nothing wrong with simplicity, there's also nothing especially brilliant about this work... Occam's Razor dates back to the 14th Century and get's official credit for the message of simplicity - but even it had caveats:    Occam's razor (or Ockham's razor), is a principle that generally recommends selecting the competing hypothesis that makes the fewest new assumptions, when the hypotheses are equal in other respects. For instance, they must both sufficiently explain available data in the first place.    The principle is often incorrectly summarized as \\"the simplest explanation is most likely the correct one\\". This summary is misleading, however, since the principle is actually focused on shifting the burden of proof in discussions. That is, the razor is a principle that suggests we should tend towards simpler theories until we can trade some simplicity for increased explanatory power. Contrary to the popular summary, the simplest available theory is sometimes a less accurate explanation.     Occam's razor is attributed to the 14th-century English logician, theologian and Franciscan friar Father William of Ockham (d'Okham) who wrote \\"entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity\\"      In the scientific method, Occam's razor is not considered an irrefutable principle of logic, and certainly not a scientific result.    Save your money, go to school, listen to your customers....and stay away from drug dealer's.  Don't buy the book.
1416955070|3.0|This book was not a favorite. Another reviewer pointed out the frequent use of \\"asshat\\", one of many distractions that throw you out of the writing. I never fully believed in any of the characters or the story, and therefore won't continue with the series. It might be better for readers on the younger end.    PROS: quick read, decent premise  CONS: shallow character development, awkward dialogue, unconvincing storyline
1439148953|2.0|There is no literary fanfare to the story-telling; instead there is a quietness that allows the narrative to unfold at its own pace. This is in step with Eilis' own nature, which is deeply serious, introverted and thoughtful. The relationships between Eilis, and her family and friends, are depicted with a fine delicacy, and the author lets the subtle undercurrents reveal themselves over the course of the story.    Many stories seem to reach out from the pages, and pull you into their vortex. This was not one that engulfed me in a similar way. A polite and proper distance was always maintained. Ultimately, the story left many questions unanswered, the conclusion was unsatisfying, and the Eilis' character was simply not one I could warm up to.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This Jillian tape has three 20 minute work-outs and each really equates to a 30 minute workout because you work your upper and lower body at the SAME time.  Of course this makes it tougher, but Jillian explains that this is the only way that you can get away with a short 20 minute workout. You WORK HARD & steady during those 20 minutes and a few days after rotating between a couple of her short routines, I went water-skiing and did not get sore! She gets you huffing and puffing in 20 minutes but if you want a quick work out - this is awesome and worthwhile.
B003Z2LAAO|2.0|There's lots of artificial 3d scenes in this blu-ray, where they take a 2d scene and computer process it into 3d. A few good genuine 3d scenes, like point of view on the rapids, but I'm repulsed by the obvious artificial 3d shots, once I notice them I can't un-notice them! And many scenes are 2d. It's also a limited film about water conservation, hopefully we will get a true 3d treatment for the Grand Canyon some day. I watched this once, where as I watch Imax Under the Sea 3d once a week. I also recommend 'The Ultimate Wave Tahiti 3d' instead, it's 100 times better and cheap also.
0439023521|5.0|I would recommend The Hunger Games to anyone, any age. The story is intriguing, the writing is simple and yet beautiful, and the characters are unforgettable (I find myself still thinking about the characters, long after finishing). Definitely one of the best things I've read in recent years. This is my favorite book in the series, though they're all wonderful and devastating and interesting.    PROS: excellent premise, great characters, well written  CONS: none that I can think of, except that it was over too quickly!
1440068070|3.0|First published in 1885, Stevenson's novella failed to attract much attention for a month or two, before it suddenly surged to popularity and became a best-seller of its time. Reading it, I was wondering if it really qualified as horror, since it wasn't, well, very horrific. But technically speaking, it is rated as horror, since it has all the necessary literary elements that are the hallmarks of this genre.     The story is told from the viewpoint of Mr. Utterson, a lawyer who is a close friend of Dr. Henry Jekyll. The good-hearted Utterson is troubled by Jekyll's association with the unsavory Edward Hyde. He fears that his friend is somehow being compromised by the latter, but how? Is Hyde Jekyll's blackmailer, or his illegitimate son? Actually, Utterson's character doesn't voice these possibilities, but we can hear him thinking them. The lawyer is filled with even more foreboding for Jekyll's safety, when the doctor makes out his will in favor of the much younger Hyde. A murder is committed, and deaths ensue before Utterson's questions are finally resolved.     `The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde' is unlikely to raise even the smallest icy prickle in the spine of a veteran fan of Horror fiction. Poor Stevenson, it's not his fault we need merely turn on the evening news to have our sensibilities inundated with stories that fill us with fear and loathing. Today's horror writers are compelled to elaborate ever further on gore-soaked and flesh-crawling details to elicit anything more than a tepid response from a desensitized reading public.     Stevenson, to his credit, is a wonderful story-teller. Though this book was written a couple of years before Jack the Ripper began his spree of  terror, Stevenson brings before our mind's eye the fogs roiling around the dimly lit streets of nineteenth century London - a place where menace, in the stunted form of Hyde, lurks around every corner, and the suspense rises to a shrill crescendo. This book predates medicaldiagnoses of psychopathic personality disorder, and holds a unique place in Literature in its study of human nature torn between good and evil. It was a prototype for the many horror/thriller books that followed in its wake.

If you knew to Jodi, yoiur bound to fall in love how she gives voice to all her charaters.

B004DMNT2W|4.0|The Lowepro Digital Video Case is just NOT for camcorders. I recently used it to take my Flip camera with an attachable zoom lens, a compact digital camera and portable USB charger. The flip was inside its pouch and I took along a couple extra SD cards and charger. Everything fit nicely into the bag and I was able to securely fasten it to my belt loop for easy access. The bag has thick padded sides for added protection against drops and bumps.<br /><br />I attempted to put my JVC HD SD camcorder in the bag, but it was just to snug of a fit for my likings. There was some tension putting it and taking it out of the bag. I then tried using it with my Kodak Playsport and also my Sanyo Xacti and they each fitted nicely with still room for cables and chargers. This case is small, but if you have compact electronic gadgets like I do, it will have many different uses. It a variety of different carrying options and perfect size to take along inside a backpack or a medium-sized purse.
1592332803|2.0|If you follow a vegan diet for health then this cookbook may not be for you. I read through each recipe to see which ones I might like to try. I didn't find any that followed good health guidelines. I tried the apple cake but the batter was nothing but dry crumbs after carefully following the recipe. I added a cup of applesauce and it turned out delicious. I want my vegan diet to be health building and I was disappointed this book did not fit my plan. The author states she is trying to have her recipes hold up next to common cooking and not for health building. Would not recommend it.
B0018RVJWM|4.0|Part survival fiction, part mind-bending psychological thriller, Yann Martel's `Life of Pi' is wholly a profound literary meditation, on the soul sustaining power of Faith.    The basic story, as told to the Narrator, is the account of Piscine Molitor Patel's horrific seven-month ordeal at sea, after the ship that he's traveling on sinks in the Pacific. Pi, with his twin majors in Zoology and Religious studies, is a compelling hero - vulnerable and invincible, gentle and savage.    Caught between the cusps of his spiritual leanings on the one side and the animalistic instinct for survival on the other, Pi, like his namesake number, defies easy definition.    I could see parallels between William Golding's `Lord of the Flies' and R.K. Narayan's `A Tiger for Malgudi'. Whatever the author's inspiration, his voice is uniquely his own. And, if he makes a few missteps in his writing, it's all the more surprising, because he's so surefooted everywhere else. Though the latter end of the book seemed to lag a little, and appeared to become a bit too surreal for comfort; in the final chapters, he had me floored, and with an immediate urge to start reading from the beginning all over again.    In Pi's shoes, what would we do? More to the point, what would we not do? And once we've done the unthinkable, how do we reclaim our humanity again? Yet, Pi emerges through his trial, his soul intact - a survivor in every sense of the word.    Is this a \\"story that will make you believe in God\\"? Well, the proof of that pudding is in the `Life of Pi'. I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever had any curiosity about the divine human animal that is Man.

Each page has something to notice in the panels, some are profound.

B003PTP4S6|5.0|I consider this is one of the best of Yo Yo Ma's work.<br /><br />a lot of attention and feeling went into the performance of Ennio's work, some of his popular movie adaption seem to take a different life and interpretation through Yo You Ma's interpretation. it has all the hallmark work of a classic performance and you will forget that some of the music has the popular origins.<br /><br />It does not draw attention to the technique of the performer, but the music and interpretation of the music clearly came through, one of the best work from the collaboration of both masters.
0060977493|3.0|\\"The God of Small Things\\" is Arundhati Roy's powerful account of a wildly dysfunctional Keralite family's personal tragedy catapulted into hideous social injustice. The series of events leading to it, and its aftermath are seen through the eyes of Estha and Rahel, twinned in soul, and not just by accident of birth.    Besides its brilliant characterization, what lends power and force to this story is the author's language - lyrical, passionate and sensuous. She excels at very luscious descriptions, and is really able to evoke the beauty of `small things'. She is equally good at evoking disgust and revulsion.    Explicit violence, graphic sex, a fixation with the male anatomy - and I felt that some of it at least, was just for effect. It seems intended to jolt the reader.    Its other drawbacks - her writing can also be jarringly idiosyncratic, riddled with metaphors that don't always work, generously sprinkled with obscenities, and annoyingly precious. When she meanders into the morass of regional politics, her tone becomes oddly flat and unconvincing. Her social criticism oscillates between heartfelt pathos, and strident hectoring.    But her delicate irony, and wicked sense of humor illuminate an otherwise joyless story. She writes like an angel, whenever she's talking about or through the children. If I ever read this book again, it would be solely for that reason. Though a lot of the book deals with ugly matters, what gives beauty to it is this - the tender humor and aching compassion. It's like a rainbow in a gutter.    The book itself is an intriguing juxtaposition of the ugly and the beautiful. In that vein, Roy's linguistic eccentricities, her shrill social criticism, and dismal world-view, are finely counterbalanced by her poetic prose, deep compassion, and, exquisite sense of humor.    Admirers of Harper Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", and Isabel Allende's \\"The House of Spirits\\" may like this book.
B0001ARCFA|3.0|Got a pair of AGK K240's at the local music store after my second pair of Grado Labs headphones started cutting out (cord issues). Long story short both the ATK and the Grado have their strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br />Both my Grado's (SR60 & SR80) are very tight, crisp, punchy, & clean with an impressive range of highs and lows but what they have in sound quality they lack in durability. I put a lot of heavy use and even a little abuse on them (running over the cord with my chair on occasion) and have never had issues with with comfort (because I used the older style flat pads). But after a year or two of daily use I usually have to tape or glue parts of the head band to make it stay together and one or both of the phones starts to cut out which is a shame because I would gladly pay a little more to have the construction quality match the sound.<br /><br />The AGK's appear to have a little more bulk to them except for the skimpier cord but fortunately it is removable/replaceable which is a nice feature if it gets damaged. Comfort is nice as well and doesn't isolate too much noise around me (I wear them at work). Sound wise they are a little flatter in the highs and muddier in the bass range but the sound stage is noticeably more impressive (probably in part due to the more closed ear design). The ATK K240's sound bigger and offer a more 3 dimensional sound experience even if certain parts of the frequency sound distant. Have read a few reviews saying that these cans have a tendency to cut out too but only time will tell. So far they have been good for the $ but if Grado upgrades the fit and finish on their Prestige Series I may be swayed to go back next time I'm in the market for new cans.

B003ZWTGKU|5.0|First of all, I´d like to state I don't fully appreciate Massenet. I always found his music superfluous, typically a divertissemant français. The recent productions of his operas are making me re-evaluate these feelings. Renée Fleming, both in Manon Lescault and Thaís, has the appeal of a great diva, and allow us to fully understand the great Opera Française.  The present Werther adds to this renewal. Jonas Kaufmann brings the tormented Werher to live again. A sensitive and handsome man, he has the brilliance of a Plácido Domingo, also a baritone that can reach the peaks of a good tenor, and allow us to penetrate the soul of a romantic character that made so many of his contemporaries commit suicide.  Sophie plays an adequate Charlotte, a woman that cannot love such a tempestuous figure like Werther but has sympathy for his sufferings. She is a woman of our times, not simply romantic but practical: an arranged marriage suits her, but still she can love and understand his companion. Not just a good singer, she is a competent actress;as for the rest of the cast, I would point that it is adequate. In our times, with all the electronic paraphernalia that surrounds a recording, it is difficult to state who has potency or only sung the notes well. One needs to watch a real performance to have a more comprehensive opinion.  Now to more controversial points. The mixing of behind the scenes and performance to me gave a plus to the record. Opera is fake by nature. It is a way of presenting feelings where we have little correspondence to reality. The real thing is hot expected here, but a way to communicate to our essential self, love, hate, sympathy, drama. By showing the players as real beings playing a role I got more close to them, to their effort to enter the climate of all that fantastic world of Opera, a mystery where all is false and at the same time people, both acting and watching, are to partake a unique moment of music, feelings, emotions.  And we must not forget that, alas, we are in the blue ray world. Multiple recordings will lead to multiple editings in the future, and a private consumer will, or can be, able to make his own version.  Last but not least, the timing. The prolonging of the music may sound strange and distasteful to Massenet lovers. Maybe such a tempo was not intended by the composer, but to me it added to the comprehension of the opera and the climate it wishes to achieve. It gave the music the longeur needed to fully understand the agony of Werther and his psychological suffering. Massenet legérete was lost, but Goethe's Werther grandeur was stressed and, in a synthesis, the work won a new dimension.
0140282033|3.0|The way to Hell is paved with slabs of chocolate according to Father Francis Reynaud, the priest of Lansquenet-sous-Tannes, the tiny French village that is the setting for Joanne Harris's charming novel, `Chocolat'.    Reynaud, wrestling with his own inner demons, is ill equipped to lead anyone else away from the slippery slopes of temptation and sin, a fact that he seems oblivious to. He watches with impotent rage as his hitherto obedient parish flock to the new chocolaterie, opened by the mysterious Vianne Rocher. He decides that drastic steps must be taken to stem this flow towards decadence, but will his measures work?    `Chocolat' pits unbending religious fanaticism against the allure of chocolate, and all it represents - sensuality, freedom from self-imposed inhibitions, and simple happiness.    Vianne's non-judgmental acceptance of people's foibles, her accommodation of an eclectic array of beliefs, and lack of adherence to social conventions, or calcifying religious convictions, puts her at odds with Reynaud - intolerant of human weaknesses, while at the same time, weighed down by his own guilty secrets, and imploding with repressed desires.    Ms. Harris takes a few well-aimed zingers against the Catholic Church, but in her over-zealous criticism, one can't help wondering if she'll throw the baby out with the bath water.    Though the pace is a little slow, and the plot leaves some loose ends untied, her narrative style is truly mouth-watering. Reynaud seems better depicted than the character Vianne, who never really springs off the page with the same degree of intensity. Occasionally, the humor seems forced, but the final chapters culminate in a wickedly delightful dénouement. We can't help but applaud when hypocrisy and intolerance so effectively prove to be their own undoing.    It's a bittersweet truth that it's difficult to wage a victorious war against chocolate. Many dieters have learned this to their anguish. But still, I can't help but feel for Father Reynaud in his predicament. How can people gorge so recklessly on chocolate, even if it is darker than the Devil's deeds, with no fear of the natural consequences - Cavities! Acne! Obesity!    After all, mindless indulgence, in anything, comes at a price. By failing to explore this, the author has lost an opportunity to make a good book better.
B003Y5H542|4.0|Rango is one of the most pleasantly weird animated movies I've ever seen. It's basically a throwback western with enough grit to make Rooster Cogburn blush.<br /><br />The visuals are gorgeous, courtesy of ILM (this being their first animated feature), with some of the characters looking more Muppet like than a creation of CGI. Maybe the closest I've seen to reaching the high standards of Pixar, but boy are they not pretty to look at. You can practically smell them.<br /><br />The story is very simple and similar to almost every western made, but the various strange looking inhabitants and clever dialogue carry most of the film. And yes, it's more clever than laugh out loud funny. In fact, most of the jokes seemed to have been missed by the people sitting around me. They are quick and often thrown out with a strong accent so you'll have to really pay attention.<br /><br />The voice cast is full of familiar names, but Johnny Depp as the title character deserves mention. He could have phoned this thing in and still made millions, but instead it seems that he put every ounce of energy and craft he possessed in creating a voice that's both memorable and interesting to listen to.<br /><br />This may seem strange, but Rango isn't made with kids in mind. Almost all of the jokes and references are aimed at adults. Likewise, the language, violence and all around meanness will likely upset small children and the parents that might be caught off guard. If The Dark Knight was a hard PG-13, this pushes PG to the limits. Some older kids might enjoy it, but like I said, most just won't get it.<br /><br />If it doesn't get forgotten due to the early release date, this could pop up for an animated film Oscar. It is not for everyone, so maybe that's why I found it so fresh and captivating.
B00395ZYVS|2.0|This story of motherhood focused on the lives of three families separated by culture, continents and oceans, connected by marriage and adoption, was easy to read and difficult to swallow.     It is built on every maternal. cultural, adoptive stereotype that comes easily to mind: all women want to bear children (unless they are selfish), adopted children always pine to know their 'real' parents, mothers rarely give up their children willingly, Western families are sterile by comparison to Asian families, mothers are the real glue that hold families together, women with children must sacrifice their careers, marriages grow stale if wives don't comprise, etc. etc. The only authentic moment in the text was the author's reaction to the mothers met in the slums of Mumbai; sadly, she did them a great disservice by implying that the women share equally in the difficulties they face.

0307387178|3.0|Jon Krakauer's books reveal his interest in people who live on the edge, pushing their frail physical resources to the extreme. \\"Into the Wild\\" is no exception. Krakauer candidly admits his fascination with the life and death of Christopher Johnson McCandless.                McCandless is an absorbing subject. Coming from a privileged background, and apparently gifted in many areas, he tosses it all aside after graduating from college to embark on the life of a vagabond, calling himself `Alex Supertramp'. When his anguished family hears about him again two years later, it is only to learn of his death from starvation in the wilderness of Alaska. This was a tragically ironic end to an idealistic young man. Before abandoning the life he knew, McCandless had magnanimously donated the remaining $24,000 in his college fund to OXFAM, a charity dedicated to fighting hunger.                The media exhaustively covered McCandless's story. Jon Krakauer himself wrote about it for `Outside' magazine. The feedback on that article was mostly excoriating, especially from native Alaskans, who deplored this attention given to a misguided, probably even mentally disturbed young man.                Krakauer's journalistic instinct, however suggested that there was more to this story than met the eye. His meticulous research turns up evidence of a multi-faceted youth, who though eccentric, was certainly sane. Alex/Chris defies easy pigeonholing; he was a charismatic loner who easily made a favorable impression on people he met. Apparently living a hippie life, he nevertheless adhered to the highest ethical values - personal dignity, no drugs, no rock and roll, no sex. What was his attraction to the wilderness? Was it the possibility of living a life unencumbered by society's rules and expectations; was it part of an intense quest for spiritual fulfillment; or was it just a pie-in-the-sky delusion of an ill-prepared boy who thought he could take on the desolate wastes of Alaska?Jon Krakauer brings his usual intensity and thoroughness to this book as he does elsewhere. As to how Alex/Chris met his death, the author's reasoning is quite convincing. He suggests many possibilities for McCandless's vanishing act into the Wild. However, by the end of the book Christopher Johnson McCandless is as intriguingly enigmatic as he was at the beginning, perhaps even more so.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I first saw this production on PBS during one of their begging periods and because of all the long interruptions did not fully enjoy it.  I immediately the next day I pre-ordered the DVD from Amazon which was shipped February 22. It is a great show with glorious voices except the Jonas kid who was totally miscast.  With a big sound system turned up this production is delightful to watch and listen to.  The DVD package, however, shows Languages:  English Dolby Digital 5.1 as a sound option.  This is not correct.  The sound setup on the DVD only works for 2.0 and the 5.1 option is grayed out and does not function. So, don't expect surround sound from this DVD. If you like the show and enjoy beautiful singing you'll like this show.
159420229X|5.0|Do you have troubles remembering special days like anniversaries or birthdays? Maybe we all forget these sometimes...  How about memorizing two decks of cards in five minutes or less?  That is what Joshua Foer did to win the 2006 U.S. Memory Championship.So he knows what he is talking about in this book. He will tell you how to improve your memory.<br />Foer says: \\"You could argue that we are nothing more and nothing less than what we remember. Memory is not just this storage vault that we dip into when we need to recall something. It's actually intimately involved in shaping how we move through the world and process the world.\\" I agree. Memory is important. You need it every day.<br />Memorization is not boring if you know the tricks how to memorize things.<br />Memory techniques used by  the people who are considered to have a good/excellent memory  are all about figuring out ways to make otherwise uninteresting information interesting and colorful and meaningful and attention-grabbing and fun!<br />The author talks about memory places, attaching a mental image to the place you need to remember.<br />It's actually how Cicero remembered his speeches, and how medieval scholars memorized entire texts.<br />If someone expects something new, something different than what has been available, then this book is not it. It is just a collection of memory tricks in one book. If you have never tried any of these tricks, then you should try!

0679745203|3.0|At the tail end of the Second World War, a young nurse, Hana, and her sole patient are locked away from the rest of the world in a crumbling monastery in the hills north of Florence in Italy. Not only is the Villa San Girolamo in ruins, its previous German occupants have booby-trapped it to blow sky-high with one unsuspecting act. But Hana's patient cannot be moved, and Hana refuses to leave him. Into their lives wander two other men: David Caravaggio, a friend from Hana's past, and Kirpal Singh - Kip - a young Sikh soldier with the British army. The power of this book lies in the lyrical beauty of its language, and the fleshing out of these four wounded souls against the backdrop of a brutal and dehumanizing war.    The story does not proceed in any linear fashion, and the reader is caught in the undertow of the protagonists' flickering memories and emotions. Each has their story to tell. Hana, the youngest of the four has seen the specter of death too often in her brief career tending to the wounded and the dying. Caravaggio, a charismatic thief, has been compelled during the course of the war into playing a far more shadowy and dangerous role, and has paid dearly for it. Kip, the sapper, has an instinct for finding and defusing bombs and mines. But his work has him living life on the edge, alert for danger from any direction and keeping the world at a distance, finding safety only in himself.    The most intriguing is the man known as the English Patient, to whom Hana devotes all her care. Dying and in an agony that can be palliated only with morphine, he still seems intensely alive, a compendium of erudition, who bears his pain with dignity, with patience. Nobody knows if he is even English, only that he might be, but then, he might be so many things. He is a man who owes his allegiance only to the undulating sands of the desert:    He has been severely burned in an airplane accident in the deserts of Africa, and has barely made it alive to the hospitals of Italy. The army, ever on the look-out for enemy spies, grills him without much success. He gives no satisfactory answer to their questions, but slowly reveals his secrets to his companions at the villa. The secrets of his life, and of the forbidden passion for a woman that has destroyed them both. The sensuous language of this book encompasses both the anatomy of desire and the landscape of longing. Love must lie somewhere between the two.
B000UNYK3A|3.0|Am I crazy?  Probably.  When I originally rented \\"Hostel\\" several years ago, I found it gory, visceral, disturbing, and not-too-soon forgotten.

B004CLYKLI|1.0|I initially had some doubts about this book after reading the excerpts, but then eventually decided to give it a try after my sister's recommendation.  Well, I just don't like it!    Throughout the book, Amy Chua kept using her daughters' musical accomplishments as the evidence of the superiority of Asian parenting.  That is just purely ignorance!  The way she (ever so proudly) boasted about the drills can happen in any family - let it be a western or an Asian one - as long as one of the parents is a bit (or a lot) nutty about making the children go extra miles in everything they do.    I do agree that kids need some pushing when it comes to practicing musical instruments/sports, or doing homework.  But the pushing I am talking about here is more like encouragement / gentle nudging - not having shouting match, making threats, or using hurtful words.  As I read what she did / said to her daughters, I cringed and felt sick to my stomach.  I couldn't stand reading the book in one go.    Professionally speaking, Amy Chua is such an accomplished person.  She prides herself to be worldly.  But she ultimately made a fool of herself with this book.  I wonder how her \\"western friends\\" would think of her, now that they know how she truly think of them, their parenting style, and their kids!    I wish Sophia and Lulu all the best!
