0307275639|5.0|This was such a down to earth book. Every word rang true.  I  could'nt put it down till I finished it.   Everyone should read this book.  It would give them such a positive outlook on life.

0385341067|3.0|Just felt the book to be a bit sloppy at part - things left unexplained, but not purposefully, but rather as if the writer forgot to develop those parts. Personally, I found the novel to be poorly written, stylistically, but that is a very subjective opinion and the girls in my book club liked the style. I was a little surprised that this was considered for a Booker Prize - really didn't find the storyline or the style all that compelling.
0790734850|5.0|1997's \\"L.A. Confidential\\" is a film noir easily worthy of its hardboiled 1940's predecessors such as \\"The Maltese Falcon.\\"  \\"L.A. Confidential\\" features a complex plot, a set of morally ambiguous heroes, a damsel in distress, and some terrific retro sets and story lines.<br /><br />The centers around three 1940's L.A. detectives, superbly played by Guy Pierce, Russell Crowe, and Kevin Spacey.  The length of the movie (over two hours) allows them to be painted in subtle and very human shades of gray. Guy Pierce plays Ed Exley, son of a prominent retired policeman, smart and slickly ambitious.  Russell Crowe plays Bud White, a two-fisted cop out to fix the wrongs he witnessed as a child.  Kevin Spacey plays Jack Vincennes, technical advisor to Hollywood crime drama producers and cynical enforcer of the Hollywood code.<br /><br />A seemingly minor Christmas-shift crime draws the three men into a complex scheme of official corruption and coverup, featuring Kim Bassinger as a high-priced hooker who portrays prominent actresses, Danny DeVito as a gossip columist, and James Cromwell as a shady Chief of Detectives.  The three detectives, each for his reasons, finally measure up to their oaths as policemen.  They will pay a high price for doing the right thing.  One is murdered, one is seriously wounded in a thrilling and horrifying gunfight that is the climax of the movie, and one only just escapes death and disgrace by outthinking the man at the center of the coverup.<br /><br />This movie is very highly recommended as superb entertainment in the classic film noir genre, presented by a talented cast and featuring a fascinating plotline.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I was a little shocked with the performance at VMA, but I did like the Gimme More song. Now, I took the risk and bought her Blackout album and after listening to all songs I can clearly tell that is her best album ever. I do wish her the best and that she starts a new tour soon and showing the world she still can entertain with her cool performances!
B000VI04HK|3.0|I decided to pick this cd up since the sound of a live R.E.M cd was appealing to me. It was pretty good but not the type of memorable performance you would expect from a band of this caliber. The song selection was excellent as it didn't concentrate on all their overplayed hits. But unlike the great live bands/performers of our time such as Springsteen, Rush, Dire Straits, etc.,..R.E.M failed to rise up and establish themselves as a top tier live band with this recording which they really needed to do at this point in their careers.  Simply put, there was nothing special about the way the songs were done on this cd and it's a little overpriced at $20 as the dvd gives you the same songs you already heard on the cd. If you are a die-hard R.E.M fan I guess you get this cd right away- otherwise wait for the price to come down or buy it used.
B000W04S6U|5.0|Not often will a game's soundtrack please everyone as there are many different tastes.  But this has to be one of the times where even people who never listen to orchestrated music, will truly be thrilled.  The CD is absolutely breathtaking simply because each musical note is crafted perfectly to fit the game.  While playing the game, we dont get a full appreciation of the track. But listening to each track gives me not only a muscal masterpiece, but it takes me back into the virtual fantasy world.  Not many albums can do this.  Oh, and finally I dont have to sit in front of  the TV staring at the home screen just to listen to \\"Never Forget!\\"
0446677450|4.0|This book says a lot of things that are vital to becoming a financially successful person - and I agree with Kiyosaki that most of the things that he teaches through this book should be taught to students in high school. The reason that this book is very helpful is that it is written in such a way that reading it is a breeze and that is what sets it apart from other such books. However I do have one qualm with Kiyosaki in that he seems to advocate real estate as the primary means of making money just because that was the way that he created his own wealth. There are other ways to become rich and you should not be limited by what he says and should use his advice as merely a starting point.
0765357151|2.0|I ordered this book after seeing a preview for the Will Smith adaption out this year (hence the cover). Great story, though much shorter than I thought. The reason for this poor review is because of the packaging. I had no idea I am Legend was one of almost a dozen other short stories in this book. The book itself if 312 pages long. I am Legend ends around page 162. No where on the cover, spine of back cover of the book does it say \\"I am Legend and other assorted short stories.\\" I thought I paid for a novel, not a short story.
B000IY06CK|5.0|First, a few disclaimers:   1) I listened to the Multi-channel SACD layer only  2) My listening setup consists mainly of Stereophile Class-B components  3) My familiarity with the Tchaikovsky violin concerto is limited to a handful of live listens and only one other recorded version, performed by Midori.    That out of the way, my notes:   - This is remarkably well-recorded -- spacious and concert hall like, but with the listener positioned in the acoustic center of everything. As compared to live, Fischer is mixed a bit louder on the recording, but this is fine as far as I'm concerned.  - A beautiful interpretation. The attacks are sharp but musical and with emotion. A wonderful tone throughout. Mvmt 1 is the best I've heard.  - I got chills at several points. To my ear, the performance is technically brilliant, but when you're listening you don't care -- she draws you in causing you to listen with your emotion rather than technique, as a good author or movie director will draw you into the story rather than the syntax...masterful.  - the very final note of the 3rd movement seemed a little off to me, but otherwise everything between soloist and orchestra was pretty tight  - no clue as to what the review who gave this a 1-star was listening...sounds like either a bad disc or a faulty playback system. my opinion couldn't be more opposite.    I'd definitely recommend. And highly.
B00008DDXC|3.0|There's no doubt HP is back, and a good bit better than before (though not redeeming the first) The lines weren't delivered nearly as atrocious as the first film. The sets looked nice and the visuals were fairly well done. The whole film was actually very good, accept for the end. After the finale, every character started getting sappy and sobbing their eyes out. Aside from about 5 minutes of this we get a bit of atrocious acting from the caniving Draco Malfoy's father, Lucious Malfoy, who delivers one really long corny line (with his arm dramatically outstretched) that diminishes the rest of the films decent acting. After this a little house elf (a rip off of LOTR's Gollum Loydd Alexander's Gurgi all wrapped in one) comes out of nowhere and knocks his former \\"master\\" (yes, they, for some reason beyond me, decide to throw a anti-racism moral in there. As morally good as that is, the stories blind strive for poitical correctness is all to evident at points) down a large flight stairs and declares his apparent new life as a \\"free elf\\". Yup that about did it for me, a good movie destroyed by an awful ending, pity.    If you're a die hard fan of HP or liked the first film you'll probably like this one.    If you are neither of these things, go watch Lord of the Rings or read the well-written book this was based on.
0767821629|4.0|Great thriller, which will keep you guessing until the last frame. The last twist makes you question what reality is.     It made me ponder whether we really are at the top of the food chain or whether we simply serve as food for hyperdimensional beings? An interesting question which Gurdjieff, Carlos Castaneda and the Sufis amongst others have alluded to. For exploring this question I can recommend the book by Laura Knight-Jadczyk [[ASIN:0976406497 The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive]] for starters.
B00005MP58|5.0|Absolutely  the best of all the Jane Austen movies, or series. Such wit, and ah! the romance. Who couldn't help but be mesmerized by Colin Firth's, Mr. Darcy.All of these actors in the various roles of Pride and Prejudice are A1. Wonderful!
B000VI70WM|5.0|I love this CD. It's got a bit of everything. The title song ROCKS, She's Too Much is a really sentimental, beautiful song, Tempted is bound to be a favorite in dance clubs. The first single, Falling Down is by far not my favorite on the album, so if that's the only song you know right now and are not too crazy about it, buy this CD because you will not be disappointed! Hopefully the next singles will be Skin Divers and Nite Runner - which are contemporary songs but with the DD charm. I can't stop listening to it!! ***** - Five Stars!!
B00003CXI1|2.0|Ah yes, the well acclaimed and expensive first part of the Harry Potter saga. Ah yes, you might be wondering why this is so critically acclaimed?! Well that's just it, I havn't got the faintest idea. The visual effects were nice to look at at points, but the children's acting is simply put, atrocious. Every other line the kids spoke was either a stupid line to begin with or it was delivered horribly, seriously people, this is supposed to be an adventure fantasy not a school play. I actually don't hold the children (who are in truth good actors) at fault for this film, I hold mostly the director responsible, he didn't push the actors like he should have, he took a decent screenplay and truned into childish mush, he took a good concept and made one of the corniest films possible out of it.    The single thing Chris Columbus did right on this film was the cinematography, there were beautiful shots of the school of magic it was all simply put, gorgeous (which is the only reason I didn't give this film one star).    I first saw this film when I was in the hospital after having my appendix taken out, I sat back and I breathed in, I WAS FINALLY GOING TO SEE THE WORLD RENOUNED HARRY POTTER (yippie)!......... (oh no), I must say I was forgiving of the film when I first saw it, but then again I had just had a ton of morphine pumped into me. Let it be known, after this I decided to read the book, I decided to give this film another fighting chance, ........ (OH NO) It was even worse when you read the book beforehand! The book, which I could take seriously, had been destroyed by super corny directing! Super stupid bad guys! Super over-acting. Urgh    Let's face it, Harry Potter is a fairly easy film to pull off, I meanc ome on. The book doesn't go into Harry's inner thoughts at all, the story has a fairly typical (and hideous) villains, the story is the same as always with the things (The main adventurous male character, the super smart female, and the not so smart bumble secondary male character). Yet Coloumbus couldn't even pull those super simple characters off right, Harry himself was virtually emotionless the entire film!    As a whole, disappointing, but don't let that get you down, some the future installments aint half bad.......
6304708491|4.0|This is the Beatles second feature film, vintage 1965, full of great songs, zippy dialogue, and wry satire. Is it as miraculous as Hard Day's Night? No, not really--but, hey---It's the Beatles, so you'll luv it!!! My actual reason in writing this review is to celebrate the demise of some Green Meanies who have been preying on Help! Hungry fans for the many years that went by with the film not in production on DVD. With the updated DVD re-release of HELP! finally arriving in late 2007,  Beatle fans who have waited to see this glorious romp again will be spared the price-gouging that has been associated with the old MPI version, or having to go the back-alley route with Asian bootlegs. It does my heart good to see the price dropping on the MPIs, and it gives me even more joy to see some of these bandits kicking the price up even higher, as if somehow the old MPI version just got more rare. No--it just got more OBSOLETE!! Don't get suckered!! Unless you have a yen for one of the old ones, or you think it will be a collector's item, pass on these and get the new version. I admit that I was so disappointed in the Miramax Hard Day's Night that I sought out an MPI version and was much happier--but I sure didn't drop $200 on it!!! I let it slide to a reasonable price, well under $20 before I scooped it up. Don't let Kahili eat up your money--just go to the window and you won't miss the sacrifice!! Let the vultures smack into the ground hard before you one-click it. In any event, enjoy the trip back to a simpler, more melodic time, with chiming guitars, glorious harmonies, and some of the best songwriting ever!
B000YCLRBA|5.0|Anyone making a short list of the all time greatest operas needs to give serious consideration to Eugene Onegin. Not only is this opera filled with beautiful melodies, it also contains a very dramatic story told episodically, almost as a tableaux of grand scenes. The story is unconventional in that the lovers never get together because they are never on the same page romantically, initially he is too mature for her, then, later, ironically, when he finally becomes interested, she is too mature for him. There is death in this opera, but the real tragedy of Eugene Onegin is the title character's self-centered, unfeeling hubris, and finally his regrets. All of this is expressed through music so achingly romantic it washes over the listener like a wave. Anyone who thinks Tchaikovsky was just a composer of pretty ballets has obviously never seen or heard Eugene Onegin.    I saw this production when it was broadcast to a local cineplex earlier this year. I was so enthralled and excited by what I had experienced(I was high on this performance for days!) that I have been anxiously waiting for it to be released on DVD ever since. The production itself isn't perfect, but the performances are(the Met repeats the success of its La Traviata of a few years ago by reuniting the same three leads with the same conductor), and the result is a Eugene Onegin whose like we are unlikely to see again, at least during my lifetime.    The leads could not be more ideally cast. Renee Fleming and Dmitri Hvorostovsky are what is popularly referred as the complete package, a combination of knockout looks, intelligence, charisma, dramatic ability, oh, and did I forget to mention vocal talent? Hvorostovsky broods handsomely, and his icy detachment is chilling, abetted in no small measure by the depth of his baritone voice. His Onegin is easy to fall in love with, but hard to feel much sympathy for, at least until the end, which is how it should be. Fleming is quite a bit older than Tatianna, but is still youthfully lovely, and capable of exploring the young innocent's tormented emotions. Besides, her age and experience make her character's eventual maturation into a regal and sophisticated woman of the world that much more convincing. Fleming's mood-swinging, ultimately giddy Letter Scene brings down the house,(remember, when I saw this it was in a movie theater, watching the performance via satellite, and the result was just as overpowering). Ramon Vargas has the impassioned, jealous tenor thing down pat, he obviously draws on his experience singing Alfredo, and he makes for a fiery Lensky. The mezzo-soprano who sings Olga(I don't recall her name) is attractive and appropriately flirty. Musically, I'd rate this performance as flawless. Conductor Valery Gergiev's deep understanding of this score is obvious, so is his equally deep love for it.     The production is mostly good, but with some problems. For instance, I don't understand why Tatianna's bed is placed in the middle of the outdoors other than to give her an excuse to fling leaves across the stage at the climax of the Letter Scene. Maybe this is supposed to represent how her writing the letter is her liberation from confinement...if so, well, it works better conceptually than visually. And the ballroom scenes are minimalist to the extreme, lacking any grandeur, which attenuates the effectiveness of the staging. Certain operas, such as Traviata and this one, should always be opulent(this director could take a few lessons from Franco Zefferelli), no matter how modernist operas in general become, because the opulence is an important element of the storytelling. Onegin is supposed to be distanced from and bored by the bourgeois spectacle he sees, by the aristocratic circles he finds himself traveling in, and their values,  but this is hard to convey when there isn't any bourgeois spectacle to be bored BY. My feeling, this is minimalism without any understanding of the subtexts of the opera, minimalism for its own sake, just to do something different, an attempt to add intimacy to a scene that isn't really supposed to be intimate. On a positive note, the opening scene is superb, as are the scenes where Onegin rebuffs Tatianna's affections and their final intimate drawing room duet. The duel, staged completely in shadows, is rather unsettling. Here the creepy minimalism makes perfect sense, and the result is one of the most effective opera scenes I've seen in recent memory. For the most part the production works, despite being disappointing in places, at the very least it never distracts from the performances, which might sound like a left-handed compliment but is a compliment nonetheless.    One more thing, concerning the price. I was tempted to knock off a star due to the fact that Deutsche Grammophon has chosen to release this as a two disc set even though the opera is only about two-and-a-half hours long and therefore capable of fitting on one. I have the same complaint about the upcoming I Puritani, which I saw when it was broadcast on PBS, also an excellent performance, very much worth owning, but also short enough to fit on a single disc. Obviously I'm planning to suck it up(for Onegin, and perhaps for Puritani as well) and shell out the money because the idea of not owning this is unthinkable, but in the meantime, color me disgruntled. In the end, though, I have decided to rate the performance, not the price, in which case the five stars is well deserved.
034544678X|5.0|By the time I came into my dog's life, I thought she was a lost cause. I tried all of the tricks I had seen my parents use when growing up, but her behaviors only seemed to get worse. The Other End of the Leash made me much more aware of why my dog was acting the way she was, and of the things I was doing to trigger her behaviors. She is a different dog than she was six months ago, she is a pleasure to take into public now. I have learned what to look for in her body language and how to instill confidence in her. This book is no longer on my personal shelf because I passed it on to a friend.
B000UO338W|5.0|Another awesome album, but the worst thing is it's their last, I hope by the end of the CU Latour they reconsider how much music needs them.
B000001GBJ|5.0|One of the most heartfelt passionate pieces of music I have ever owned. Beautifully arranged, excellently produced, and an performance of a lifetime. It is everything you would dream of and more.
B000E5N6LG|5.0|I really enjoyed this, capital 'H', Hollywood historical epic film and fully expect I'll return to it from time to time.  Casey<br />Tefertiller's book 'Wyatt Earp' helped make this epic depiction much more fun for me as I could link and look forward and back on the TONS of missing detail that the film simply hasn't the time to include.  For all that, this is an outstanding movie.  If you're a western/Tombstone fan, history buff, etc, get your spurs on and spend 3 hours in the 1800's.  GREAT film!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Pixar does it again! This movie has humor and life lessons for people of all ages.
B000VL9XNI|4.0|Good product. Have to say I'm a little disappointed with the picture quality. But I'm a huge AC/DC fan, so it was really good stuff to me. But the Japanese concert is absolute crap and I can't watch that, but besides that it's mostly good stuff. 8.5 overall. Would still say buy it for those huge AC/DC fans like me.
B000059HAI|5.0|I have seen the TV miniseries \\"Pearl\\" and the disastrous \\"Pearl Harbor\\" and I still say \\"Tora, Tora, Tora\\" is the finest telling of the story of Pearl Harbor I have ever seen.  The battle sequences were state-of-the-art for it's day, and even the model work is superb. There is very little of the hammy drama that the other versions had, and more of the straight truth that was the disaster and tragedy of the Day of Infamy.  What makes it so special is that it viewed the battle from both sides, with American and Japanese directors.  I can't say I forgive the Japanese for the attack, but as a result of the film, I came to understand more of the reasons the attack happened.  The film shows that mistakes made by the American commanders were compounded by the fact that the United States was just not ready for war.  Unfortuantely, both General Short (Jason Robards) and Admiral Kimmel (Martin Balsam)were made into scapegoats for our lack of preparedness, but each in his way tried to prevent the attack with what resources and knowledge they had, but it just wasn't enough. The individual heroism of both the Americans and the Japanese as soldiers reflected honor on the part of both adversaries.  Even Yamamoto argued against the attack, but when he was overruled, he did his duty.  And while Japanese naval officers celebrated their success, Yamamoto said \\"I fear all we have done is awaken a sleeping giant and fill it with a terrible resolve.\\"    By the way, USAF General Ken Taylor, one of the two young Army Air Corps pilots who got off the ground in a P-40 Warhawk that day visited the set while it was being made and undoubtedly contributed his expertise.      I rate this film as 5 + stars, with bravura performances by the entire cast and crew.
0061547832|4.0|Many people will not like this, because the typical Trump approach applies throughout the book.  However, I think I limit myself by not  thinking big enough. This book was perfect for me.      I am working on a new business and as I move closer to this being a reality, I had started to scale down my goals.  As I scaled down to more \\"reasonable\\" goals, I felt worse about the business.  After reading this book I realized the only reason I had scaled down was fear.  It was going to take a bigger commitment to start at the bigger better level.    Glad I read the book.  It was a good shot in the arm and something I think I will reread regularly to remind myself of the proper mindset.
B00000263T|5.0|Liked the time in which it arrived and in good condition case not cracked as that can sometimes happen coming from overseas
B000WCBPOG|4.0|these versions differ from the actual ones used in the film. The vocals were all filmed live, so there are many songs here that dont' match up to what you see in the film exactly. Most significant is Dear Prudence, which has a totally different rhythm than the version in the film.     BUT...aside from being a little disappointed at the absence of Paul's bouncy, walking bass line in All My Lovin', I really enjoyed these renditions of these great songs. I do tend to be a bit of a Beatles Purist, and don't like anyone messing with the perfection the Fab Four achieved, but I just loved this film. Besides totally falling in love with Jim Sturgess, who also eerily reminded me of an ex, I enjoyed Julie Taymor's vision, imagery and symbolism. She did a fabulous job showing the chaos of the times, and how the Beatles' music reflected what was going on then, and how their music changed as the times changed, from the stripped down innocence of Hold Me Tight and It Won't Be Long, to the complexity and the layers of Strawberry Fields Forever, Helter Skelter and the song that inspired the title, the plaintive chorus, \\"Nothing's gonna change my world\\" playing while Max's stunned, glazed over eyes survey the carnage in Viet Nam, realizing all their worlds have been irrepairably changed forever. You hear a great deal more in these songs after seeing the movie, and the soundtrack recalls that.      The soundtrack brings back the best parts of the movie, and does put a very fresh and refreshing spin on, while paying homage to, this great music.
B000VL9XE2|4.0|The Dillinger Escape Plan's problems leading up to the release of Ire Works was a complex one. It was simple that their problem was choice. On one hand, The Dillinger Escape Plan has been one of the most respected metal bands in recent history. Their first full-length album, Calculating Infinity, was seen by many as the prime example of how jazzy technical metal should be done. One cannot buy a guitar or drum magazine without seeing an article about DEP. On the other hand, the band has been excused of everything from rehash (Irony is a Dead Scene) to selling out (the vastly underrated Miss Machine). It seemed that The Dillinger Escape Plan could do no right after an album that was so perfect. To mention that the competition has only gotten stiffer and the band only has one remaining original member would be too ruthless. Considering all of this, Ire Works is another warped turn into metallic mayhem.<br /><br />To ease the diehards' suspicions, The Dillinger Escape Plan can still bring a huge slab of technical metal. \\"Fix Your Face\\" and \\"Lurch\\", the album's openers, quickly dismiss any doubters that this band isn't about to write \\"Enter Sadman\\". One of the greatest elements of Ire Works is how the band really makes an album more than an album. This isn't just 13 songs put onto a disc. Much like Dredg's El Cielo, the band tries to make the listener take a journey outside of their dorm room. One of the more interesting blends is \\"Nong Eye Gong\\" with \\"When Acting as a Wave\\". While at first, the song just starts in grand DEP fashion, \\"When Acting...\\" goes into an instrumental jam that should only be heard with headphones to fully appreciate. A lot of the heavier songs would not be out of place on Calculating or Miss Machine. Because as much as the band ventures out, they are always aware of why people listen to DEP in the first place.<br /><br />However, venturing with new sounds has never been a weakness for the Dillinger Escape Plan. \\"Black Bubblegum\\" is one of the catchiest songs that the band has ever written. It is interesting to note that the bands more experimental numbers have a Patton/Bungle sound to them. At other times, the band really hones in on electronic ambience to keep the album flowing a good pace.  Other numbers like \\"Milk Lizard\\" are a little Everytime I Die worship (probably due to the fact that two bands toured together), but it doesn't happen frequently enough to sway you from enjoying the album. By far the album's more experimental track is \\"Dead As History\\", which the band does something they have never done before. They rely on groove. Yes, the band that has numbers like \\"43% Burnt\\" and \\"Panasonic Youth\\" actually relies on a guitar groove to carry them through. The listener can be the judge as to whether or not they think it works.<br /><br />For the most part, The Dillinger Escape Plan has continued to be more deadly and more experimental all in the same breath. What makes the album work so well is the fact that the heavier tracks mesh really well with some of the more experimental tracks.

B000Y179KO|5.0|I am very happy with this new album.  To put it simply, it kicks and rocks.  \\"Busy Being Fabulous\\" and \\"How Long\\" take me back to the 1970s, that's how good they are.  Also the opening track, \\"No More Walks in the Wood\\" is beautiful, harmonious melody.  Glenn Frey once commented on being a big Beach Boys fan - perhaps there was inspiration there?      While I am happy with this release, I am disappointed about the lack of a 2008 US tour.  I find it odd that they have just put out their first new material since 1994 and they're not supporting it with a tour.  Anyway, buy this album, because it is wonderful.

0810993139|4.0|Diary of a wimpy kid is a must reader for young readers. Not only is it an astonishing book, but it also gives you an idea about middle school. The main character is Greg Hefley, he is in 6th grade stuck with people he doesn't like and the catch of his stories is that he and his friend Rowley go on some sweet adventures. He is always trying to get Rowley to stop doing things he hates. The best part is there's no dear diary this dear diary that. Most kids will stay stuck on Captain Under Pants when they get to old for it. Well, I recommend this for 3rd graders to 7th graders. This book has some back stabbing, plenty of humor and some lies. That's why I rate it four stars but it's a great book that is recommended to all kids who are looking for something to enjoy. Comment me on my review at msabha2004@yahoo.com . I hoped you liked it.

If I'd wanted to read Phillip Pullmans dumb musings about his perceptions on God and religion then I would have looked them up. I thought that I was buying a fantasy novel and was very disapointed when I found out it was just his little outlet for his mental constipation he was having. I am annoyed that Mr. Pullman managed to waste so much of my time. In addition, all pathetic athiest dogma aside, this is NOT a book for children. Even if it had no alterior motives, there is some sexuality and violence in these books that is not for kids. Nor adults for that matter. Anyway. Waste of time, waste of money.

B000LC55F2|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie!  When I saw it in the theatres, I could NOT wait to have my own copy......but beware, if you cannot sit down and truly pay attention while watching this, you will be lost very quickly and the movie will lose its appeal.  The Prestige throws you many curve balls and you always have to \\"watch the hand that's doing the tricks\\".  I'll admit, too, that when I saw it in the theatres, I kept asking myself, \\"how'd that happen?\\", \\"I thought he was....\\" but trust me it ALL comes together in the end and when it does, it's BRILLIANT!  Enjoy :)
0446577391|5.0|This is the continuation of The Collectors as well as another story, both of which converge...of course. Annabelle, the con artist, is pursued by the crazed casino owner she ripped off. Harry Finn, mild-mannered family man, is killing the CIA's former Triple Six guys who killed his father. The Camel Club guys are involved in both stories, and Oliver Stone tries to help everyone and ends up a target.<br /><br />This is probably the best of the Camel Club series. It started a wee bit slow, but soon I couldn't put it down. There's plenty of action, suspense and knocking the political scene. Thanks, Mr. B!

0385339682|4.0|Over John Grisham's writing career, it seems that he occasionally experiments with new writing styles or themes. With \\"The Last Juror\\", Grisham experiments with the style of first-person writing. The book follows Willie Traynor as Willie narrates the time in his life in which he was first an employee of, then later the owner/editor of the Ford County Times in Ford County, Mississippi.  This new style, however, does little to affect the quality of the writing. As is normal for a Grisham novel, the story line is very interesting and easy to be drawn into. Also normal are the twists and surprises thrown in now and then. The story contains a very action-packed trial which, although not covered in great detail, is still rather entertaining with a reasonable amount of legal wrangling described.  As a whole, \\"The Last Juror\\" is simply another Grisham novel with a few new characteristics thrown in to make it fresh and exciting. It is old Grisham and yet new grisham at the same time. I enjoyed reading this book, and definitely recommend it, as well as Grisham's other novels. Read and enjoy.

0385335997|5.0|[[ASIN:0385335997 Voyager]] Terrific series by new author, starting with the incredible first book Outlander.  She really creates her subjects and her knowledge of Scottish history is impeccable. A must read.  At the moment the series has seven books.  I'm only on the fourth, but I can't put these books down. A remarkable author and rewarding reads.
0452282152|3.0|I will confess that I watched the film before reading the book, and I will also admit that I did enjoy the film version a bit more.  I am a fan of the artist Vermeer, and was more interested in his character in \\"Girl With a Pearl Earring,\\" than I was with the character of Griet.  Not a bad read, though.  The back drop of 1600s Holland saved the chick-lit plot line of the book.  I will recommend this book to those who like fairy tale stories.  Griet is a kind of Dutch Cinderella who goes from simple servant, to muse, to wife.

A game between two members of the nobility of the opposite sex leads to none other than \\"Dangerous Liasons.\\"  This book was written in \\"letter format\\", that is correspondences between individuals, which can get confusing at times, but the reader, paying close attention, will be able to follow the plot.   A fine example of what sexual excess without borders can lead to.
0671891634|4.0|After managing the Fidelity Magellan fund for thirteen years, mutual fund guru Peter Lynch retired on May 31, 1990 at the age of forty-six. Since then, Lynch continues to propound his message that the amateur investor has a distinct comparative advantage in stock picking relative to Wall Street professionals. For example, mutual fund managers are restricted to investing no more than 5% of their total assets in any one stock, and they cannot own more that 10% of any one company's stock. These constraints limit their profit, but not for the average investor. Lynch adamantly chants his mantra, \\"Buy stocks! If this is the only lesson you learn from this book, then writing it will have been worth the trouble\\" (18).    One major reason for touting stocks is that they have grown by an average of 11% (i.e. 8% capital gain + 3% dividend) per/year over the last seventy-years, despite over forty market corrections. Aside from short-term stock-price fluctuations, Lynch believes that in the long-run there exists a strong correlation between the success of a business and its stock price. Therefore, anyone can successfully invest in stocks provided they use common sense observation, and proven valuation strategies that they recheck every three-months. Lynch recommends the NAIC (National Association of Investors Clubs) to neophyte investors who want to learn how to evaluate a business, and be part of an organization whose methods routinely beat the market averages. Amazingly, 75% of professional mutual fund managers fail to outperform the S&P after fees.     When searching for possible companies to invest in, Lynch visits the Burlington Mall in Massachusetts to see where everyone shops. Lynch says, \\"The very homogeneity of taste in food and fashion that makes for a dull culture also makes fortunes for owners\\" (152). When analyzing stocks Lynch looks at several prospective indicators:     Fundamental Analysis:  1) Look at for stocks whose charts show earnings above price. These businesses have value that have yet to be priced-in  2) The P/E ratio shouldn't be greater than the business' earnings growth rate  3) Particularly in retail stocks, look for an increase in same-store sales  4) Best conditions for businesses to grow earnings are in niche or regional markets where there is little competition and much room for expansion  5) Insider buying is a good sign that the business is doing well  6) Look for arbitrage opportunities where a business is selling at a discount relative to its peers despite similar composition and performance  7) When taking a \\"top-down\\" approach look at the \\"affordability index,\\" median home value, and % of mortgage defaults published by the National Association of Home Builders    Technical Analysis:  1) Buy stocks on Mondays, and from October through December when historical prices are lowest
B00003CXCT|5.0|I grew up watching these movies when they were in the theaters. I'm not a fan of the \\"new\\" scenes, but they do not take away from the movie and those that didn't see them in the 70's and 80's probably wouldn't know the difference anyway. I would've liked a feature that allowed you to view the DVD in original form. But I can't give this trilogy anything other than 5 stars!
0316067598|4.0|I just finished this book, and all I can say is wow!  I am amazed at all they go through to become SEALS, and at the strength you must have to even consider it.  I like the background he gives us about himself, and how he tried his whole life to be a soldier because he views it as honorable.  The most intense scenes start in the middle of the book, and here is where it picks up pace.  After reading the battle scene, in which his friends are described as being shot multiple times and still able to defend themselves you could easily think you were reading a novel, as the strength these men showed seemed unreal, and at times unbelievable.  I do no doubt he is telling the truth, just that the strength was amazing.  I hope this becomes a movie, and if it does, I hope they do not change a thing.  My only complaint was his sniping against the media, which is understandable, but at times annoying.  Other than that, I recommend it highly.

0618680004|3.0|I'm a staunch atheist, and am first to admit that fact.  From an atheist's point of view, Dawkins' book was absolutely brilliant.  His arguments are clear, concise, and thought-provoking.  However, The God Delusion is obviously written by an atheist for other atheists.  Certain ideas presented by Dawkins (e.g we should stop teaching our children our religion), while true and obviously a correct path, really aren't anything more than idealist principals.      In short, this book is absolutely fascinating and completely right; however, if you're not an atheist and don't have an open mind, don't read it!  The God Delusion will not (as we need a book to do) allow the conservative right to see the \\"light,\\" and abandon personal religion, but it will offer brilliant ideas and theories to anyone with an open mind.
B000AM6OHQ|5.0|Exile is not one of the Stones' more immediately accessible albums; it takes a while to appreciate its treasures. At first listen it might sound just raw and messy but eventually the scales fall from your ears and a true gem is revealed. Very much of a cohesive whole, the album gains momentum in its successive tracks to display the multifaceted rock virtuosity of the Stones at their most powerful. The music is intense throughout and often energetic. To me, the first section culminates in the lilting masterpiece Tumbling Dice.<br /><br />The yearning country strains of Sweet Virginia introduce the next segment; this song reminds me of Far Away Eyes on the 1978 album [[ASIN:B000000W5P Some Girls]]. Torn And Frayed has a similar soulful country feel and the catchy Sweet Black Angel is probably the closest to a pop song on the album. The track Happy is the bridge between this sensitive segment and the harder or bluesier rock of Whatever On The Run, Ventilator Blues, the spooky atmospheric I Just Want To See His Face and the soulful Let It Loose.<br /><br />The uptempo hard rock of All Down The Line opens the final section, followed by Stop Breaking Down with its jangling guitars and Shine A Light with its varied tempo and complex arrangement. The album concludes with the driving rock of Soul Survivor. There are moments on Exile, especially the slower songs, that evoke the sound of 1971's [[ASIN:B000000W5N Sticky Fingers]] while others remind me somewhat of the aforementioned album Some Girls. I wouldn't say this is the best of all Stones albums, but it definitely belongs in the top 5 of their work.

Even England, the last bastion of civilisation, is slipping into choas.<br /><br />Cuaron's vision of the future is memorable but the plot is less interesting.

Ends abruptly. And what exactly is the point?

B0007Q6RJ0|5.0|Much is made of records and bands that missed the boat, due to bad timing, lack of support from their label or other mishaps. Introspection certainly falls into the \\"should have been\\" catagory. Produced by Bill Wyman of the Stones, in the rose-colored Satanic Majesties era, this wonderful album sat on the shelf and missed it's moment, in the rapidly shifting UK music scene. Shades Of Orange showed up on various collections, but here you have the whole magic kettle. Gentle pop-psychedelia that is well written, performed and produced, evoking early Traffic with that fairytale floating over the fields headspace. However this holds up very well over time, and what might have seems passe in 1969, sounds classic and gemlike in the light of a new century. These songs are windows to pop heaven, a very good trip indeed. My only quibble is with the spoken word bits, they did not age as well as the music.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|It was endearing as a story book when I first came upon The Snowman as a kid. It had no words. Just those captivating blues and whites on the page.     The same charm is captured in this short animation. Everything is as it was in the book, only this time the images move. Every kid (and the young at heart) is sure to love the story of a snowman who comes to life one evening and befriends a little boy. Together, they spend an evening of fun, first inside the boy's house, in the snow-covered yard, then into the north pole where the boy meets a community of snowmen and Santa, too. And after those funny moments and the lilting music, the bittersweet ending is unexpected. That last scene continues to haunt me every time I remember The Snowman.

B00002RAOU|4.0|In many ways Bay of Blood can be seen as the first slasher movie, while the years prior to the release of Bay of Blood there were other movies that inspired many slasher movies and you can even see the influence in Mario Bava's Blood and Black Lace, but here with Bay of Blood there are a lot more slasher elements than most Giallos, which already have some to begin with. A lot of the clich&eacute;s that would later become very common with slasher flicks are seen in Bay of Blood.<br /><br />This is a very interesting Giallo where pretty much every character is some how involved with murder. There really aren't any innocent characters. But the problem is the concept while excellent it isn't really executed that entirely well. I do think Bay of Blood is a classic of the genre, but as classic as it is, it's also very flawed.<br /><br />The screenplay by Mario Bava, Filippo Ottoni & Giuseppe Zaccariello is rather weak. The characters really lack any depth and it's kinda hard to tell them a part. There is actually a lot of plot here. Everybody is some how tied into the murders and it's hard to keep track of all the plot twists. Bay of Blood is a little complicated to follow. It's not that the plot is complicated it's just the writing is weak. There are many ideas, but they are sort of poorly delivered.<br /><br />I'm as big a fan as you will find of Italian horror flicks, but in general it's not about the writing. I have seen many Italian horror flicks that are very well written, but normally it's about the look and murder scenes rather than a coherent plot.<br /><br />As a director Mario Bava is able to keep the pace moving pretty good for the most part. Bava is a great director, but his storytelling skills might be a little weak. There is more to directing than just telling a story, granted that is the most important aspect, but there is more and Bava is able to create a great visually stunning movie with a lot of tension. While I don't think Bay of Blood is his strongest picture I do think it might be his most enjoyable.<br /><br />The first half moves rather quickly with about 6 murders in a 40-minute span; but after that the pacing is a bit uneven mainly due to the amount of plot twists. Bay of Blood isn't the first Giallo, but you can see the impact this movie made on filmmakers like Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci. The biggest impact Bay of Blood made was on Friday the 13th and it's first sequel. The setting is similar, plus the murder scenes are a lot a like. It's very clear where the makers of the first 2 Friday the 13th movie got their ideas from with the murder scenes.<br /><br />As I stated there were other Giallos before this as well as other movies that inspired the slasher flick, but this was one of the first if not the first to feature characters we would later see in countless slasher flicks. There's a subplot involving 4 characters, two guys and two girls. They are young and looking to party, but meet rather grizzly ends.<br /><br />The biggest problem with Bay of Blood is the writing; the characters lack depth and the writing wasn't strong enough for all these plot twists, and the 2nd half can have some boring moments, but as a whole Bay of Blood really is a well done movie. Despite the flaws Bay of Blood works well; this is also possibly the first body count film, visually the movie looks amazing and the kill scenes are excellent. There is some decent gore, but remember this is 1971, gore flicks were still sort of new and the Make Up F/X artists were still learning their craft, but you get a double impalement, a cleaver to the face, slit throats and even a decapitation.<br /><br />The ending has been described as idiotic by some and brilliant by others. One thing I can say is the twist is something you would never see coming. As idiotic as it is, it's also really brilliant.most enjoyable.

1582701709|2.0|The Law of Attraction as a way to view life is powerful and often, effective. This book is an amazingly poor expression of that power. Since it is basically just a transcription of partial interviews that were in the movie of the same name, the tone and structure is difficult to follow, and the points seem haphazard and arbitrary.  That is really too bad, because there is some fairly profound insight within the approach to life and the mindset it recommends.  It takes a lot to glean that from the book The Secret.<br />It would have been nice if the authors has actually written a book instead of opting for so lazy a way to convey the thinking that underpins The Secret.  If you want to understand how to use the Law of Attraction for your own fulfillment and happiness, you'd do better to search on Google and read the various websites, newsgroups, e-zines and chats about it.

B000YABV90|5.0|Some people hear the rhythm in a step, the strident beauty of a police siren, the whip of a powerline in the wind.  Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore) doesn't get a decent night's sleep in the orphanage because of it.  His fellow inmates call him freak because he believes both his parents are living and they'll come for him--if only he call out with the music that connects them.      As he says, \\"I believe in music the way some people believe in fairy tales.\\" So, Evan decides after eleven years and some days to escape the orphanage and go find the music--and his parents.      Even ends up in New York City with zero street smarts.  He really doesn't even know how to cross the road. A fortunate encounter puts him near Arthur (Leon G. Thomas III), a street busker his age who's willing to help--for a price. Arthur introduces him to Wizard (Robin Williams) who gives musically talented street kids a place to stay in exchange for half their take. The Wizard quickly discovers that Evan, who he renames August Rush, is a prodigy and is making some plans for the lad.    Meanwhile, we learn that Even's mom Lyla Novacek (Kerri Russell) had only been with Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) one night. The Julliard educated cellist was in an accident while pregnant and her father decided to sign her name and give up her son--telling Lyla that he'd died.  Instead of the stage career her father envisioned, Lyla mostly gave up music and taught--til Julliard called her for a special concert in Central Park.    Louis has always longed for Lyla, the girl who got away.  He gave up his music and became a manager.  When he brings a girl to meet his family, they play a song he'd written for the band after Lyla's departure from his life.  He's determined to find Lyla.  When he believes she is married, he ends up in New York with no particular goals in mind except to find his music again.      \\"August Rush\\" is just as much about the musical ties that bind us as the three people whose stories ittells.  In my opinion, the best performances were the kids: Evan-August, Arthur and Hope (Jamia Simone Nash). This trio kept you captivated and cheering.      Of course, the soundtrack is fabulous.  You have Kaki King on the guitar as well as vocals from John Legend and John Ondrasik (Five for Fighting fame). I'm ordering the soundtrack tonight and I really don't often like movie soundtracks well enough to order.    I wasn't the only person who'd give this film 5 stars.  This is one of the rare films I've attended where many of the audience stood and applauded at the end.  While this is a family film, I did notice that some of the younger children got restless and needed some explanation of what was going on.

B000VI70WM|5.0|I know some people are selling out with some of the R&B-sounding tracks, but hey're doing the right thing by updating their sound, yet they maintain much of what is familiarly DD.  Artists that have longevity continue to sell their albums well because they evolve.  They is a good variety of styles, from Rock, to Ballad to R&B.  I love 75% of the songs on this CD, which is rare for me, so it's easily 5 stars.  Tracks 1-7, 9, and 10.    1. The Valley - Catchy song.  Too bad the beat sounds weak.  2. Red Carpet Massacre - Lots of energy, whiny chorus.  Raw drums and sax, like Nelly Furtado's \\"Maneater\\" sped-up.  My 2nd fave song after growing on me.  3. Night Runner - Catchy lyrics.  Awesome beat.  Sounds like a Justin song.  4. Falling down.  Most true to DD sound.  Reminds me of \\"Come Undone\\"  5. Box Full of Honey - Likable driving-into-the-desert music.  6. Skin Divers - Sick!  Had to grow on me, but now is my fave song.  This can rock a club.  7. Tempted - Timberland-esque new wave dancey song.  Love it!  8. Tricked Out - Boring instrumental.  9. Zoom In - Great eeire rock song.  10. She's Too Much - Lonely beat ballad, like Nelly Furtado's \\"All Good Things\\".  11. Dirty Great Monster - Forgettable.  12. Last Man Standing - Forgettable.

B00005JPS9|1.0|This sex-obsessed, ultra-cynical re-imagining of the Old-English epic offers quasi-cartoon virtual nude versions of various actors (most notably Angelina Jolie as a she-devil), some of the usual Hollywood over-the-top action and jumping around, some gratuitous anti-Christian rhetoric and imagery, and one or two clever ideas in a script that is mostly moronic.  If you want a story where Grendel is just a poor sensitive boy, and where Beowulf is \\"the real monster\\", then go right ahead.<br /><br />A number of scenes and ideas here are lifted straight from John Boorman's EXCALIBUR:  (1) An evil witch seduces a sleepy hero while disguised as the woman he loves, only to reveal herself shockingly while astride him; (2) this hero's liaison with the witch returns to haunt him on the form of an evil gold-plated son; (3) the aged hero-king reconciles with his estranged wife before his final battle, saying he wished she could have loved him as a man, not a king.  All these scenes, however, worked far better in that far-better film.  Here, the disguised seduction serves no purpose, since our hero is quite willing to boink the witch anyway.  Here, our hero's last line to his wife falls flat since he is admirable neither as a man nor as king, and since their never-developed relationship has no importance to the story.  And EXCALIBUR's Golden Boy was far creepier.<br /><br />I am not a purist who thinks a film-maker should never change his sources. But since the original epic - let's face it - is no easy read, I  will here list a few differences:<br /><br />In the Epic: (1)  The narrator tells us the characters are heathens who have never heard of Christ, though it is still understood that God is somehow active in their lives; (2) Characters do not go around moaning that the Christ-god is ruining their fun; (3)  Unferth is not an evil Christian -- he is neither evil nor Christian; he is never shown beating his servant; (4)  As in the film, it is stated the Unferth slew his brothers, but not because they were sleeping with their mother; (5)  We never find out who Grendel's father is (he and his mother are ultimately descended from Cain); (6)  Beowulf is the champion of God, from whence comes his gift of strength; whereas Grendel and his mother are agents of the Devil;  (7)  Beowulf lacked false humility, but was honest -- all his boasts were true;  (8)  Grendel hated God, and was inspired to attack by the sound of Danes singing praises to their Creator (Odin, presumably), and not by songs about the ravishing of conquered virgins; (9)  Beowulf did not fight Grendel in the nude -- the point was to fight without weapons, not to titillate onlookers; (10) Grendel was magically immune to mortal weapons -- this being the whole reason Beowulf fought Grendel without weapons -- that means Beowulf did not use chains, and did not use doors; (11) when Grendel's mother takes revenge for his death, she kills an aged counselor of Hrothgar, not Beowulf's entire troop; (12)  When Beowulf faces Grendel's mother, he is wearing helmet and (magic) armor, which save his life; (13)  The blade Unferth lends Beowulf does not melt; Beowulf returns it intact; (14) The blade which melts is a Giant-forged blade, which Beowulf pulls from the wall, and uses to slay the mother and decapitate Grendel; it is the blood of both demons that dissolves the blade; (15) Grendel's mother does not try to seduce Beowulf; she tries to kill him; (16) Beowulf does not have sex with Grendel's mother; he kills her; (17) Hrothgar is perfectly happy following the defeat of Grendel's mother, and does not jump off a building; (18)  Beowulf does not inherit Hrothgar's kingdom, or marry Hrothgar's wife - he returns to his own land, and ultimately becomes king there; (19)  The dragon was not Beowulf's son, had no connection to Grendel's mother, and never took the form of a golden man;  (20)  Unferth and his family do not fall victim to the Dragon after Unferth tries to ward it off with an impotent crucifix; (21) Beowulf's battle with the dragon never leaves the mouth of its lair; (22)  Wiglaf was not present earlier in the tale (presumably because he is much younger than Beowulf); (23) Wiglaf helps Beowulf defeat the dragon, by personally joining the fight after Beowulf starts to lose; (24)  Beowulf dies from the dragon's poison fangs, and not from self mutilation.<br /><br />That should at least help you keep a few things straight in literature class.<br /><br />The Christ-bashing bits seem gratuitous and well-nigh incomprehensible.  At best it is unintentionally funny, as where Hrothgar, rejecting the evil Unferth's suggestion that they pray to the Christ God, says \\"The gods will do nothing for us that we cannot do for ourselves -- we need a Hero.\\"  Less funny, but even more of a jaw-dropping puzzlement, is Beowulf's announcement that \\"The time of heroes is dead; the Christ god has killed it, leaving nothing but weeping martyrs and fear and shame.\\"  What's that, Beowulf?  Is it Christ's fault you boinked a demon, lied about it, and cursed your kingdom?  Or is it merely Christ's fault you now feel ashamed of yourself?  Or are you upset that those meddlesome priests frown on the raping of enemy virgins?  Or perhaps it is all that Unferth's fault for giving you a melting sword, causing you to boink when you should have fought, thereby turning you into the joyless whining Tragedian you are today.<br /><br />The irony is that dark-age Christians loved the story of Beowulf, and preserved it, or we would not have it today.  Indeed, a Christian poet wrote the only version of the tale that has survived.  And that Beowulf was a larger-than-life hero, honest and true.  It is modern cynics like scriptwriters Avary & Gaiman who seek to destroy the hero, and have done so with this movie.rucifix; (21) Beowulf's battle with the dragon never leaves the mouth of its lair; (22)  Wiglaf was not present earlier in the tale (presumably because he is much younger than Beowulf); (23) Wiglaf helps Beowulf defeat the dragon, by personally joining the fight after Beowulf starts to lose; (24)  Beowulf dies from the dragon's poison fangs, and not from self mutilation.<br /><br />That should at least help you keep a few things straight in literature class.<br /><br />The Christ-bashing bits seem gratuitous and well-nigh incomprehensible.

B000VI6T6K|3.0|I hate to burst anyone's bubble; and Eddie Kramer did a fine re-mix & master on this, but all it really is is a re-working of the original album release.        This album first came out on CD in 1987, re-mixed & re-mastered, & trimmed in order to fit the CD. It's ok that the Hendrix estate brought it back in it's original form. But there's nothing new here. For those of you under the age of 50, who may have heard the name Jimi Hendrix in passing, this concert is a good place to start. For those of us who have seen all the film, and have all the CD's, this is just the Hendrix estate squeezing another nickle out of something that's had it's day in the sun......

B00005JLKB|5.0|Having followed Superman since the George Reeves TV show, and the comics from the 60's, and the first couple of Christopher Reeves films.  I'm pretty generally happy with the genre.  I've sort of fallen off the reinventions of Superman, haven't seen the Lois and Clark, and the new movie with Kevin Spacey.    I originally stayed away from Smallville because the advertising made it appear racier than it turned out, and furthermore the crucifixion imagery was a bit disturbing.    I finally bought this set because I thought it might bring a contemporary feel my 10-year old son would appreciate.  What I found impressed me quite a bit, especially the pilot episode.  Rather than retell the Superman story, the assumption is that the viewer is fully acquainted with the lore.  Thus they don't need to reenact the entire Superman myth, from Krypton and so on.  I imagine more of the backstory will come out over time (I've only see the first 3 episodes).  There's a healthy dose of X-Files moodiness around some of the antagonists who appear in the episodes.    What makes me think the series is a success is when my kids said \\"I thought Lex Luthor and Superman were enemies... what happened.\\"  And I told them: \\"That's what makes it so compelling--you see how they meet, and you know from the lore where they end up, but exactly how and over what time their relationships is going to be very interesting.\\"  And that anticipation is what makes me want to keep watching the show.    I should add the acting very good all around, and it's really nice to see familiar faces like John Schneider and Annette O'Toole (back from Superman III in a new role).
B00004WKII|5.0|This is a must have it you like Jimi Hendrix. This set includes studio songs and several unreleased live songs, which I have never heard before.

0374105235|5.0|Ishmael Beah has been reborn.  At 12, he went to visit relatives in a town 16 miles away from his home in Sierra Leone.  This is the last time he would ever see his parents.  At 16, he is in a rehabilitation center in Freetown, one of a group of children trying to transition back to some type of normal life.  In between, as told by Beah in A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier, he was trained to be a soldier, a murderer, a torturer, a drug user, and many other horrible things.  Beah grimly confesses to killing many people, innocents and rebels alike, with an AK-47, a G3 assault rifle, an RPG, and a bayonet.  He shoots people, blows them up, buries them alive, and slits their throats.  In this era of civil war in Sierra Leone, he was a survivor, while his family and friends were not.<br /><br />In A Long Way Gone, Beah discusses his successes and failures as a child soldier (he never volunteered, and at one time was chosen to be a practice target for new rebel recruits), his life before his time as a soldier, his UN-sponsored rehabilitation, and the subsequent collapse of civil authority in Freetown and his escape to the US.<br /><br />It is depressing to read about how easily children can become soldiers.  In the US, it is very rare for 12-14 year olds to kill; for Beah, he did it or he was dead himself.<br /><br />Written as a narrative, the choppy nature of his storytelling led to my impression of its authenticity.  His degree in political science from Oberlin College served him well for getting his message out.<br /><br />There are issues not discussed in this book.  It would surprise me if he was not involved in even more odious forms of torture, rape, and other crimes than he confesses to in this book.  I don't blame him for not wanting to recount it; he confesses to enough.  But was there a switch flipped that completely turned off his humanity?  Was he the worse of the worst?  Only \\"average\\"?  Were there times he left food and shelter behind for the civilians which, like him at one time, were innocents?<br /><br />He focused on his initial rejection of UN staff telling him that \\"It's not your fault.\\"  Would it be his fault if he was 16?  17?  18?  What do you tell the hundreds, if not thousands, of families affected by his actions?  Beah never promotes himself as brave or noble.  He very matter-of-factly notes the way life was.  That is the crucial part of this book.  He doesn't shy away from taking responsibility for his actions.  He doesn't say \\"poor little me.\\"  He affirms the horrors of what he experienced as a victim, and as a victor.<br /><br />But in the end, how does one accept responsibility for these horrible actions and not slink off to a dark alley with a bottle of cheap whiskey?  This book, these confessions, is a good start.  Currently, Beah is involved in international efforts to bring recognition to the treatment of children in armed conflicts.<br /><br />What would I tell Beah if I met him?<br /><br />Ishmael, IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.  But there is, as you know, blood on your hands.  Please continue to do what you can to keep other children from experiencing what you did.  Please continue to tell your story.  Determine what actions really work to prevent this, and preach against those hollow programs that talk the talk and don't walk the walk.<br /><br />And finally, Ishmael, be a beacon in the dark for all who suffer child endangerment and child exploitation.  Your story will help others speak out.e, were innocents?    He focused on his initial rejection of UN staff telling him that \\"It's not your fault.\\"  Would it be his fault if he was 16?  17?  18?

The book is full of arrogance and obvious embellishments every page of the way. In the end, he dishonors those that died during Operation Redwing, he dishonors every soldier and marine who ever served in a combat operation, and he dishonors our country through this poorly written, self righteous waste of time.

0312323867|5.0|If you haven't read \\"Something Borrowed\\" I definitely suggest reading it first.  This book is basically a continuation of that book, only told from the point of view of a different character.  I think you'd lose a lot of insight into some of the things in this book without having read \\"Something Borrowed\\" first.  That being said, this book is just as hard to put down as the first one.<br /><br />This time, we get to hear things from Darcy's point of view. It talks a bit about things from the first book in her point of view, and yes, Darcy is just as immature and shallow in the beginning of this book as she was in the previous one, but you do get more insight into her character. You learn that she occasionally admits to herself that maybe she is a bit shallow, and maybe she isn't necessarily a victim, and just maybe, her best friend doesn't need to wither away because not everything is always everyone else's fault. It's really fun to watch Darcy grow from the shallow, somewhat unlikeable person she was into a person with more depth and a greater appreciation of life and the people around her (as opposed to just shopping and getting things for herself).<br /><br />It's also a chance to see what happens with Darcy and Rachel's relationship, and of course Darcy in general. This book still leaves you wanting more of these two women, but only because by the end they're both so likeable that you wish there was more. If you loved \\"Something Borrowed\\" you have to read this one, even if you hated Darcy in the first book. This one is just as well written, and it's wonderful to see Darcy mature and grow. Definitely read both \\"Something Borrowed\\" and \\"Something Blue\\" - both are very good, and very hard to put down.
6300182193|1.0|Despite some simpering reviews, mostly on the star qualities of Langella and Olivier, this is really a fairly bad movie. Slow, ponderous, changes from Stoker's for no visible reason, and generally wooden performances form the actors.    Much has been made of the fact that the movie was overshadowed at release by Nosferatu the Vampyr and even Love At First Bite - if it wasn't for them, the lovie argument goes, this film would have shone. Well actually, if it was overshadowed, perhaps the critics should ask why.    Nosferatu featured a monstrous Dracula, who happened to be more sensuous than Langella, who camped it up as much as Love At First Bite - but without the comedy to go with it.    Had they stuck to the story, they'd at least have that in their favour ... as it is, it's just one more lumpen movie.
0385335482|2.0|But I just wasn't able to.  Perhaps it's because I had a hard time liking the main character, Becky.  Becky was just way too stupid throughout most of the book for me to be able to relate to her in any good way.  Becky likes to shop.  So she goes shopping.  Becky has a bad day.  So she goes shopping.  Becky doesn't like her job.  So she goes shopping. Becky discovers she's run up too much debt and her bank is after her.  So she goes shopping.  I do realize this is \\"Confessions of a Shopaholic\\" but Becky manages to be waaaay too extreme, and so it's really hard to have any sympathy for her at all.<br /><br />I eventually had to start skimming the book (when I was a bit more than halfway through), because I just couldn't deal with Becky anymore, but I wanted to see if she ever actually became less self-centered and got a clue.  So the only redeeming quality of this book is that Becky does eventually seem to get a clue and discover that there's more to life than just racking up massive amounts of debt and then lying and whining about it.  However, judging from the rest of the book, this may have just been a temporary revelation that will quickly come to an end in the next book.<br /><br />If you want to read this book, I would suggest getting it from the library rather than spending money on it.  The ending of it was enough for me to want to go to the library and eventually check out (or at least skim while standing next to the shelf) the next one to see if Becky continues to improve or not, but I can't say I'm in a rush to get over there for it either.  I suspect I'm almost worried that Becky may just go back to her shallow, pathetic existence of non-stop shopping, lying, and whining about debt, taking away what little redemption there was of her at the end of this book.  And I'm not sure I could deal with another bout of the same old Becky that started out in this book.<br /><br />Otherwise, if you want a book more or less along the lines of this one with a more likable character that's better written and a more enjoyable read, I suggest going for \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" instead.ter written and a more enjoyable read, I suggest going for \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" instead.
0553584537|4.0|When veteran officer Bobby  Dodge of the Massachusetts State Police Special Tactics and Operations Team is called out to a hostage situation in progress, little does he know that in a matter of moments his life would change. Seeing a woman with a young child in her arms held at gunpoint, he keeps  the gunman in his sight of his scope from fifty yards away, but when the gunman rips the child from the woman's arms and points the gun directly at the woman's head, his finger tightening on the trigger, State Trooper Bobby Dodge does what he was trained to do.<br /><br />It is that split second action that will raise questions that remain unanswerable until Bobby puts on his thinking cap in a very unorthodox way. Moreover, the beautiful damsel in distress, Catherine Rose Gagnon, has a lot of issues, including a secret past that continues to haunt her. Her child also has issues, but what they are will keep the reader guessing until the shocking finale. Once again, this author has created another intense thriller. Full of surprises and suspense, this fast-paced, intricately plotted book will keep the reader turning its pages.
0060855924|5.0|At this point, I have read many more of Terry Pratchett's books, but so far all of them have been enjoyable.  Some more so than others, but I'd highly recommend him as an author.  \\"The Color of Magic\\" is a great introduction to his fabulous Discworld series.  While I would say it's probably not quite as deep as his later books, it is also the first book, and it's the one I started the series with.  It's a definite worthwhile read.  The antics and situations Twoflower and Rincewind get into are hilarious.<br /><br />Terry Pratchett is a very funny author, and his characters are genuinely enjoyable.  His books are very lighthearted fantasy, and easy to read and enjoy.  If you like Douglas Adams, you are sure to like Terry Pratchet.  And if nothing else, you must read this (and later books) for the Luggage.  I am always thrilled when the Luggage shows up in his books.  Terry Pratchett is a must read, and this book is a great start to a great series.
0307387178|1.0|I just finished reading Into The Wild after recognizing I had attended Emory Univ together (I graduated 2 years earlier). Although I find Krakauer to be a very talented writer I also find his descriptive protrayal of Chris very limited much to my chagrin. To say I knew Chris is to say I had a class with him and knew of his editorials in the \\"Wheel\\" but my own recollection is not as an outgoing, funny well adjusted guy.  Much to the contrary, he seemed to be depressed, reclusive or as some might say, a loner. My opinion doesn't take away from the the seriousness of the book, it just makes me wonder how much literary license Krakauer has used either to sell books or to help comfort his family in grief.     I suspect Chris' lack of close family bonds is likely as result of chronic depression and his rebellious behaviour is manifestation of these thoughts/beliefs.  It was noteworthy that none of the pictures supplied to the author by Chris' own sister ever showed him smiling. Indeed, I looked up his picture in my Emory yearbook and again, no smile. In fact it interesting that he is the ONLY person not smiling on the page!    I'm not critical of Chris trying to \\"find\\" himself in the wilderness as many young people often search for something similar; however, as many experience survival experts have already pointed out, it was an ill concieved plan by an inexperienced person which eventually led to his tragic death.  This cannot be denied. And it is very sad.    However, Krakauer is missing the real tragedy here; Chris was mentally sick and needed serious psychological help which might have prevented this tragic end and it is here that the author fails in my opinion. To compare his climb of Devil's Thumb with Chris is comparing apples and oranges. The author was a very accomplished climber from a young age whereas Chris had no \\"survival\\" experience as anyone who knows can tell you(many accomplished guides have pointed this fact out elsewhere).  So although Chris espousedthe literary ideals of London, Tolstoy and Thoreau, the alaskan wilderness cares not about such things which brings reality and eventually death to the young man.    It is so sad, Chris was very bright and deserved a better life, however I believe his depression drove him to his death.  His need for some form of \\"test\\" would win him acceptance from his father thus putting an end to a long bitter relationship.  Nevertheless, the book is an engaging account of a tragic part of his life and should serve as a reminder for to examine ourselves and those around us with unconditional acceptance, not so as to stop encounters into the wild but to learn from nature as a child learns to walk - carefully, one step at a time until we can run!

0553805460|5.0|I find only a few books hard to put down and this was definitely one of them.  Belfort's life was ridiculously crazy and it is amazing that he is still alive today.  Although he was a crook and con artist the man was a pure genius and brilliant speaker.  He was able to create a cult like following of those who worked at Stratton Oakmont.  How many people were responsible for sinking their 170 foot yachts because they were doped out of their minds? How many people could make 200 Million in one year and spend nearly all of it?  How many brokerage houses wanted to throw a midget around the room for pure amusement?  He lived on the edge 24 hours a day and it definitely showed in his huge drug habit.  Belfort could have been immensely rich the legal way but he chose to find fast closing loopholes and tried to jump through them. Nonetheless an interesting read.  I look forward to a sequel should one come.
0743298039|5.0|Growing up, I was not a fan of Victorian or Gothic literature. I had trouble focusing on them, and unless they were an assignment they really didn't hold my interest.     This book changed that. It gave me a reference point for these novels that all of a sudden made them feel relevant and intriguing. I've started on JANE EYRE and I'll be moving to WUTHERING HEIGHTS and THE TURN OF THE SCREW after that.     In my mind, any book that is not only wonderful on its own, but also makes other books seem more attractive is a highly worthwhile read. THE THIRTEENTH TALE is an amazing \\"gateway book\\" into Gothic and  Victorian lit. It would be wonderful to use in a high school or college setting to tease out the themes in these older novels that are still relevant today.

0316191299|5.0|A collection of real life and fictional satiric stories on Christmas. It's rib-cracking hilarious. My first encounter with David Sedaris was painfully and delightfully funny. I became a fan after reading this and this still remains my favorite book by him three books later.
B000YAF4OS|5.0|This is an excellent film adaption of a 1976 Stephen King story (included in the book The Skeleton Crew), adapted by the man who directed The Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption.  Whatever the haters are complaining about, they're wrong.  This movie was brilliant.  It's not entirely about the monsters, but what will really stick with you are the normal everyday citizens that turn into monsters under the influence of sheer terror, panic, and confusion.  Keep in mind that this is definetely NOT for for kids.  It's very gory, quite disturbing, and the ending is very depressing and heart-breaking.  Be prepared for it,it's not a happy ending.  But don't miss it, it's even better than 1408.

0316067598|5.0|As I read this book I felt like I became a personal acquantance of Lucas and felt every pain he went through.  Prior to reading \\"Lone Survivor\\" I had no idea what the Navy SEALS went through in their training.  He takes you on a blow-by-blow journey through SEALS training, so detailed that you could almost feel the wet and the cold and the sand and the extremely aching muscles as he and his fellow trainees endured to the end--that is, a few of them.    As he described his ordeal in Afghanistan you could visualize the agony of the expedition and the horror of being caught in that situation.  His discription of his rescuers in the village let you realize that not all of these people are bad.  They have a heart and many of them simply live in constant fear of those who want to control and kill.    If you believe that the folks on capitol hill in Washington are getting in the way of this war, this book will convince you that you are right.  Read with an open mind and hear it all from someone who has been there and done that.  And beyond that, he's back there doing it again.  God Bless him!

B000VEA38E|3.0|I do admit to sharing the disappointment that many fans of Star Wars feel about this boxed set reissue of Star Wars trilogy soundtracks. While I know it's a re-re-reissue of the original 1997 RCA Victor CDs, it isn't as badly presented as the 2004 Sony Classical releases. This means that we can't experience anything new compared to the previous releases - not even a better sound quality or the original Ewok finale from Return of the Jedi. Turning to this release, I rather like the nice box in which the set is housed, as the box is wrapped in nice foil-embossed paper with logos of Vader and Luke. The CDs are housed in miniature replicas of the original LP sleeves, adding a nice touch to the whole package. However, there are disappointments. The set lacks the detailed liner notes that Michael Mattesino wrote for the 1997 RCA Victor releases. Instead it only includes a poster-sized leaflet describing the different releases of the soundtrack to Star Wars Episode IV. Another gripe is that in this 30th anniversary year, I would have liked it better for the complete Star Wars saga soundtracks to be reissued and remastered completely, unedited and with proper track-by-track commentary. In short, even though this release is not as ideal as I would have liked it, at least it's an improvement over the 2004 releases because it does not include the screen savers that ruined the previous set for me. Hopefully someone will encourage John Williams and George Lucas to release the complete Star Wars saga soundtracks in the near future, and give them their due by treating them with the same kind of respect that was given to the Lord of the Rings soundtracks.

1592402038|5.0|After reading some of the negative comments listed here, I am left wondering again how often people review books they haven't actually read. As near as I can tell, all of the criticisms of Lynne Truss' book (and yes, she does comment on the ambiguity of punctuating her own name), are actually addressed by her. She is very aware that the rules of punctuation are often vague and self-contradictory. She is too self-deprecating to be characterized as pedantic, and she is very funny (and very British). Her skill at sneaking up on you repeatedly with the same recycled punchlines rivals that of the master, Dave Barry. I mean that as high compliment.         If readers just remembers that Truss writes for laughs as much as she writes for education, they will be very happy. As for the humorless reviewers here, I refer you to her own jokes about the insufferablity of \\"sticklers\\". Lighten up.
B000YAF4OS|2.0|Stephen King's The Mist was probably the most requested story-to-film project of all of King's books and stories, so says his publicist.  No one could've been more excited about this picture finally being made than I, an avid fan of King's novels and short stories since his beginning.  I believe that a lot of fans breathed a sigh of \\"finally\\" when they heard the project was under way.  And Frank Darabont has had a decent track record with King movies, if a short track for sure.  Still, they had a great ensemble cast, lead by Thomas Jane, and with cgi in full swing these days, this film had the potential of becoming a modern day science-fiction classic, in the same way that B-films like \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\", and \\"The Quatermass X-periment\\" have become undeniable classics over the years.      I asked my teenage daughter to go with me, for she too is a Stephen King fan, and I knew we were going to see something special.  About halfway through the film, I was marveling at how Darabont had gotten it down right, how good it felt, dark and frightening, otherwordly and atmospheric.  I knew the story, I'd read it so many times, because I frankly love this sci-fi/horror adventure, like I love Bradbury's Fahrenheit-451, or John Cambell's \\"Who Goes There\\", so I knew there were no surprises that a fifteen year old shouldn't see.  I was enjoying myself so much, that I was already planning to ask other people to go to it, just so I had an excuse to see it again.  And even acknowledged that I'd be buying this movie on DVD as soon as it was available.    And then when it happened in the last seven minutes of the film, when all the preceding story was mocked and destroyed in a kind of low-blow, cosmic joke, in which the main characters all decided to act against character, to step out of the classic story arc, and destroy a wonderfully paced film by turning it into a cynical existencial joke on mankind, I kept thinking, 'No way, they are not going to do this.  They can't.' But they did, and I sat there stunned, muttering, \\"I can't believe they did this.  They've ruined it.\\"  I'd waited all these years, since I first read the novella in 1983, for this film, and they ruined it. My daughter looked at me and said exactly what I was thinking, \\"I thought he would wake up and it would be a nightmare, but he didn't\\".      I won't spoil the ending for you, because it can't be spoiled any more so than watching does on its own.  If you want to know before you go to see the film, it's all over the place now, written in movie reviews and on blogs.      I've read many comments from film goers that liked or 'loved' the new twist ending, but my feeling is they never read or appriciated the original story.  There are just as many, and maybe a little bit more, of us who absolutely hated the ending.  And we know it's because that's not how it ended in the novella.  We know that David Drayton's character would not have ended the story that way.  There just is absolutely no indication that he had that character attribute at any time in the preceding story.  Not one hint.  You just don't do that in good story-telling.      I read somewhere that Darabont sent that change in the script to Stephen King and he said something like, \\"I wish I'd thought of that ending\\".  I can tell you that it is my experience that fiction editors do not like dark, cynical endings unless they are hinted at in the preceding story, and if King had written The Mist with the ending that is now in the film version forever, The Mist in novella form would most likely never have seen print.  I kind of wish it hadn't now, then I wouldn't have wanted a film version so badly.  In any case, I went from wanting to see The Mist again and again, and to wanting to buy the DVD, to never wanting to see the movie again. What a drag.

1577311760|2.0|I'll make this short and sweet, ok maybe not so sweet.  I listened to this audiobook and was determined to finish listening to the end as I had hoped the point the author was trying to convey would deliver some profound spiritual message. In a way it did... Live life in the here and now  as it is the \\"now\\" thinking that creates everything else.  THAT is the bottom line....   Listening to the monotonous drone of   Eckhart Tolle was excruciating.  I had also found a DVD lecture given by this author which I watched out of curiosity and thought that Mr Tolle exhibits a bit of \\"egoic superiority\\"...     Ok ok he's human.     The basic message,(as written above) is the essence and is an important one. so I give this review 2 stars for that.

B000QQFKYE|4.0|There are many good things going in Inland Empire, but the movie lacks form. Rather, it lacks decision. Should Lynch try this again, let's hope for four or five really good short pieces which complete themselves. After Mulholland Drive, I had high hopes for this one. I was excited when I saw the bunnies in the preview; the gorgeous Polish drawing room thrilled me in the first part; the crazy old lady; the cigarette and silk. But what became of it? A run-on (and on, and on, and on.) Now; I'll say I love the whole thing and wish that it could be five stars. But even though I love it, my values and judgement will not allow me to give it this rating.<br /><br />For Lynch completists only. David, if I may be so bold, give us another Blue Velvet, aother Mulholland, another Elephant Man, another Eraserhead for Chrissake! But not this installation piece, please! It's a movie, not a museum. But Laura Dern, why, she amazes me always.
1400032717|4.0|One might think that an individual who is a keen observer of the physical world, is very logical, and is a math whiz, and, in addition, has a near photographic memory would be well on the way to mastering the world. But what happens when mere facts lead to such nonsensical conclusions as thinking that a day is going to be good simply because four cars in a row are red or bad with four being yellow? If in addition there is the inability to understand or adapt to subtleties of language, like metaphors, intonations, or facial expressions then social functioning must necessarily be greatly impaired.<br /><br />Such is the case for fifteen-year-old Christopher John Francis Boone living in Swindon, England with his working-class father. He is a special needs student with a real penchant for wanting to be undisturbed. He overreacts to being touched, dislikes strangers, is given to hiding in small spaces, and often is found groaning or listening to static on the radio to drown out his surroundings.<br /><br />When Christopher discovers that the neighbor's poodle has been killed by a pitchfork, he is driven to solve the murder by assembling facts, much as does his hero Sherlock Holmes. But the investigation soon reveals family secrets with which he must contend on his own despite his social limitations. He makes a solo journey to London with great trepidation.<br /><br />The author has created a highly sympathetic character in Christopher, though his disabilities seem to be considerably less than real world autistic children. It is clear that he wants to impress that sensitive adults are needed for such children.<br /><br />It seems that the author is also intent on commenting on the illusions and misstatements of so-called normal people. For example, when informed that heaven is not in the universe, Christopher reasonably attempts to coordinate that view with the concept of black holes. In other words, the illogic of the normal world is doubly frustrating to those who can only understand the world from a logical standpoint.<br /><br />The book is short and reads easily - no real psychological jargon. Christopher is the narrator which provides real insight into the workings of the mind of someone socially and developmentally challenged, though exceedingly smart from a scientific standpoint. The book is part murder mystery (the neighbor's dog), but there are many digressions that are explicative of the pattern of thinking and behavior that is typified by Christopher.a logical standpoint.

It moves at a blistering pace, has bad guys you want to hate, comic relief, and one of the most satisfying endings I can think of.  This director's cut just goes to show that maybe some things are better left alone.  The additional footage confuses and slows down the plot, the plot changes make other parts of the movie absurd, and the pacing is completely shot.    Bad. Bad. Bad.    Would have been nice if they also included \\"The Awesome Original Cut\\" along with \\"The Richard Donner Cut\\".
B000RW3VD4|5.0|This movie is my all-time favorite.  The snappy quips and memorable quotes are the features of a very well-written and well-acted movie.  Michael Douglas as Gordon Gekko is one of the great all-time movie characters.  This movie epitomizes how greed was interwoven into the Wall Street scandals of the 1980's.  Oliver Stone's depiction of this time in American history is extremely well done.  The extras in this DVD give the viewer a behind-the-scenes look at the actors and the legacy of this classic film.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who values great acting and excellent character development.

0385333846|5.0|This classic story follows Billy Pilgrim through Dresden, his marriage, his life on an alien planet, and death.  Yet it mostly follows him to Dresden in World War II where he was a child at war (he was technically an adult, yet a young one).  His ability to time travel was given to him by the aliens where he frequently returns to the life and events at Dresden Germany.  A town that was later firebombed killing many Germans who were not soldiers, or an industrious city.      A book that tries to get you to focus on the beauty of life, while trying to teach about the atrocities that sometimes happens and no one knows about.
B000002UAX|5.0|No doubt, this is one of the best, if not the best album the 60's ever produced.  The later generation of rockers were greatly influenced by this album. I was born in 1968, and even if i didn't hear the album during its initial release, all the songs seem so familiar. I rate this the BEST Beatles album.  Revolver, Rubber Soul and Sgt. Pepper are my 2nd, 3rd and 4th next best.  Each members individuality really came out here!
B000VL9XE2|5.0|This album is a culmination of everything the band has created since its inception. If anything I feel it's the ultimate showcase of how talented and world-class Dillinger is.    It's true some songs are better than others, but how many bands can blast out the most absolute insane tech-metal, give you some standard structure songs, and end the CD on what is more or less straight jazz?     Exactly.    They covered Timberlake's \\"Like I Love You\\" and did it better than than him. They always have jazz break-downs in some of their most intense songs. Why is \\"Black Bubblegum\\" a surprise? Why is \\"Mouth of Ghosts\\" a surprise?    Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but when a band who is at the molecule thin cutting edge of musical extremity gives you things you've never heard from them before, I can only sit back and appreciate it.    It's always debatable whether this is better than Calculating Infinity or Miss Machine.    To expect Dillinger to do the spastic/whiplash/no time signature song everytime is to not respect their artistry.    Enjoy it for what it is.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|Making this DVD 12 months after the movie gives an opportunity to check on movements in climatic change during that time. I began university in 1960, a little before Al Gore, and we were told of the increasing CO2 in the atmosphere. No one was sure of the consequences, and some predicted new ice ages. Al Gore has neatly connected the dots over this 50 year span, but I fear that our wakening to the dangers is more than 50 years too late. Remember that in 1850 England alone burned 50,000,000 tons of coal to sustain its Steam Age industrial revolution, and the forests of Europe had been burned to charcoal to smelt iron!   Nevertheless, all power to Al for his insights, and the best of luck to the rest of us!

B00005JPMZ|3.0|Being a huge fan of the original Ninja Turtles cartoon series and 3 movies, I naturally had to buy this DVD when I saw it at Wal-Mart! But I had a lot of doubts in me because I'm not too crazy over the \\"NEW\\" cartoon series and I knew this was based on the new series. The reasons I don't like the new series is because of it's comic book art style [and the turtles have no pupils] and there's no Krang, Bebop, or Rocksteady. And I'm sad to say that this TMNT movie is exactly what I was affraid it would be...a letdown!       Sure, the CG animation looks great and all [April O'Neil never looked better] but I would have greatly preferred another live action movie. This movie made me feel like I missed something, almost like there was another movie before this one and I missed it. Because in this movie, Shredder is supposedly dead...which was a great disappointment to me. There's a new bad guy in this movie which I believe made this movie boring! Well, that AND the story. And since when does April O'Neil know any kind of martial arts? Since I don't watch the NEW series, I don't know! I guess all I can do is hope that eventually the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles gets back to it's original greatness again! But as long as they're going with this new comic book art style and darker stories, that day will never come.

B000YAF4OS|4.0|Writer / Director Frank Darabont's adaptations of THE GREEN MILE and SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION are clearly (along with Rob Reiner's STAND BY ME) the best filmed adaptations of Stephen King's work.  He gets, unlike someone like Stanley Kubrick  DIDN'T get with THE SHINING, that King is just as interested in the human interactions and reactions to the supernatural as he is in the supernatural itself.   His best stories don't just trot out horrific events, they trot out an assortment of flawed but interesting people to deal with those events.  Darabont's THE MIST doesn't quite reach the same lofty heights as his previous adaptations...but there is still much to admire.    THE MIST is a fairly straightforward Stephen King novella.  A mysterious and very thick mist rolls in over a small town in Maine, and as the inhabitants quickly discover, there are amazingly vicious and awful creatures populating this mist.  So a group of townspeople hole up inside a grocery store, and immediately the bickering begins.  Some want simply to leave...others want to sit and wait.  After awhile, those left waiting begin to splinter into those who wish to take some action and those who are happy to cower.  And then there are those that believe that God has brought his wrath to bear on the town and only turning to him will save them.      While the creatures outside are indeed horrific (in fact, they are among King's most basic, terrible creations.  They are creatures that seem to exist purely to tear people into little pieces and consume them), the events that unfold inside are really what build the tension to the breaking point.    Darabont CLEARLY understands that is the true heart of this simple story, and he focuses much of his attention on the interactions of the unusual grouping of survivors.  (This is probably a good thing, because when the creatures ARE seen, the CGI effects that render them are not the greatest.  The monsters are still quite gruesome looking, but they aren't really convincing.  Again, it's the reactions of the people to those monsters that convinces us to be horrified.)    The cast is very good.  No huge names, but all are well cast.  Thomas Jane is the \\"hero\\" of the tale, an illustrator who has come to town with his little boy, leaving his wife behind at home.  He is a sturdy, competent presence...able to be scared, but able to be brave as well.  He keeps his head, and others see this and turn to him as a leader.  Andre Braugher appears as a haughty attorney, and he is, as always, a charismatic presence.  The always wonderful Frances Sternhagen (Cliff's mother on CHEERS) steals her few scenes as a feisty old lady.  And I'd like to commend Laurie Holden, who very convincingly plays the young school teacher who brings some heart and sympathy to the scene.  She is not a well-known actress (she played Anna Kovarubias on THE X-FILES) but I think she could be quite good.  I also liked Toby Jones as the seemingly-meek store manager, and William Sadler as a dangerously simple-minded blue-collar type.  But it could be argued that the show is stolen by Marcia Gay Harden's nearly over-the-top but just in-control role as the hell-and-brimstone spouting religious zealot who leads her growing group of followers to commit acts that are nearly as horrific as those happening on the outside.    At no moment is this a \\"believable\\" film...it is a horror movie...nothing more.  Yet it takes the clichés of the genre (the group of people trapped in a building) and elevates them a little.  Darabont has kept the best parts of King's story...the elements that brought humanity to this story.     The movie is not perfect.  I mentioned the effects already.  And I must touch on the ending.  If you remember King's story, the ending was VERY open-ended.  It was frustrating, but it was creepy too.  Darabont has recognized that it's less fair for a movie-goer to simply leave `em hanging.  So he has concocted an ending.  Some people may like the ending...but without spoiling anything, I'm going to say that I did not like it.  I can't discuss specifics...but to me, it shifted the tone of the film from a horror film to something even more horrifying...uncomfortably so.  This is a genre film after all...to have it take on an almost philosophical level of squirminess is not fair to the spirit of the 110 minutes that have come before the final 10 minutes.    Nonetheless, I can recommend the film.  It is rated \\"R\\" for pretty strong language, and the violence...but it also isn't for youngsters because its presentation of humanity is a little harsh too.  If you're a fan of King or of horror films, check it out.  If you're looking merely to be lightly entertained...stay away.

B000BW7QWW|1.0|Let me start by saying that I was very excited to see this movie. I was in high spirits when I went to see it in theatres, and I am very easily entertained by movies in general. And yes, I like sci-fi and have a soft spot for fantasy. The plot seemed to have everything going for it. In theory, the idea of a fantasy/sci-fi mixed with western elements sounds intriguing. Really, how could it go wrong? I'll tell you how: bad characterization, bad acting and bad writing. This movie seems to have failed in all those areas. I could barely sit through it. For probably the first time in years, my attention actually drifted in the theater. I was counting the little lights on the aisles because it was more entertaining than watching this mess. The biggest problem I had was with the characters themselves. They felt flat and one-dimensional, and I didn't buy them at all. More importantly, I found them unsympathetic -- especially River. I don't know if it's more a problem with the acting or the script, but I'm pretty sure it's a combination of both. The writing seemed immature to me and just... dull and cliched. The lines were equivalent to those you'd find in a mediocre made-for-TV sci-fi. And the progression of the story was sloppy and disjointed. I would point out the numerous examples, but that would mean watching the movie again, and I would rather watch a movie on UPN. I would advise not to come to this movie with high expectations. Or avoid it altogether; that would be my suggestion.<br /><br />I'm sorry to all of the Firefly fans for disrupting the parade or praise, but I just can't understand how this movie has received so many 5 star reviews. Granted, I never saw any episodes of Firefly myself, but shouldn't a movie be able to stand on its own, to a certain extent? I think it should.

B000QUEQBI|4.0|Very well done -- followed the book it was based upon closely (within the time alloted) -- just remember, the books are always BETTER!
B000N3ST7K|5.0|I gave this 5 stars based on the music selection which is awesome.  But, I do have one complaint which is that the spoken word clips from the movie were poorly chosen.  There were so many better \\"scenes\\" to include the audio of... but the music more than makes up for that and I just skip 'em.  I listen to Stagger Lee every chance I get.
B000R8YC3G|1.0|me and several friends watched this movie and we all felt the same way about it !!  it was so bad that i threw it in the trash i should have burned it   i have never seen any thing so stupid and boring in my life.  i gave this a one star and that is over doing it by far
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|There is a lot of negativity surrounding Britney, and I find it all very sad.  The paparazzi is going to make her look bad in every way they can.  Of course she ran the red light everyone is freaking out about, the paparazzi was all over her!      Seriously, give the girl a break.    So aside from her drama, \\"Blackout,\\" is actually a very good album.  It's got the good beats, fun choruses and of course, the sexy voices added by Ms. Spears.    1.) Gimme More (*****)- So if you haven't heard this song, you've been living in a hole somewhere.  I actually like it.  Whereas it does lack in the lyrics, it's still a lot of fun.  2.) Piece of Me (*****)- One of the best here.  I love how the lyrics attack the paparazzi.  It's fun and it's catchy.  3.) Radar (*****)- Wasn't a favorite at first, but it slowly but surely grew on me.  Classic Britney fun.  4.) Break the Ice (*****)- Definitely has to be a single.  Just fantastic.  5.) Heaven On Earth (*****)- I don't see how people can say this is the worst song on the album.  I disagree completely.  I think it's the best, actually.  For some reason, it reminds me of the old Britney.  She sounds like she's smiling when singing it.  6.) Get Naked (I Got A Plan) (***)- I hate Danja's part in this song.  It's not the best song here.  There are too many moments where Britney just seems to disappear out of the song.  7.) Freakshow (****)- It's slowly growing on me.  Britney did contribute to this song, which is always good.  8.) Toy Soldier (*****)- Love it!  It's been one of my favorites since I heard the leak!  9.) Hot As Ice (****)- I just have a few issues, not a terrible song.  But it can get annoying.  10.) Ooh Ooh Baby (*****)- Now this is the song I play over and over again.  It's perfect for Britney.  I love every second of it.  11.) Perfect Lover (****)- Not bad, but also not my favorite.  12.) Why Should I Be Sad (***)- Just not catchy nor memorable at all.    Now, I am not a teeny bopper wannabe who is a Britney fanatic.I used to be, but I'm not anymore.  I gave this CD a chance and I'm very glad I did.
0307387178|5.0|This was a tragic tale of an idealistic young man who just may have gone too far to defy convention.  My opinion after reading this book was that Chris \\"Alex Supertramp\\" McCandless was under prepared in his quest and greatly overestimated his capabilities.  It was a great story, pieced together by Jon Krakauer through meticulous research and interviews following the discovery of McCandless's body (although Krakauer diverts from the story too long to recount his own reckless youth and mountaineering adventures in his attempt to relate to McCandless).  The book had an eerie, mysterious undertone, and I was moved by the tragic circumstances.
0307346617|5.0|It's been a long time since I read a book that scared me as badly as this one, which was exactly what I was hoping for when I decided to read it. The author created a world that was totally plausible and impeccably detailed. His military jargon was spot-on, up to and including the military's fondness for acronyms. The interview-style narration gave it an extra feeling of authenticity, as though this could really happen. So far I've read it three times, and each time I'm sucked in from the first page. And it still gives me chills!
B000W4HJ44|4.0|This a enjoyable version of the broadway movie with lots of great songs and energy from the all star cast...  I just watched the 1988 movie version and I saw that the previous one had a slightly different story and this was definitely patterned after the broadway show which highlighted the delightful songs...in my opinion the original movie had lots of great dancing as compared to the new version, no singing in the original as it was not a musical version, and the main difference between the 2 Tracy's were so obvious.. as much as both were delightful and amazing you could see that Ricki lake is a great dancer and her dancing skills were highlighted in the movie, and Nikki Blonsky is an amazing singer and has all the makings of a great stage actress and entertainer, but her dancing is far from Ms. LAke...the original movie also showed more intercation between Link and Tracy and lots of making out...the new version is more stage like and has very minimal interaction between the 2 and I also noticed that Link had more serious dance moves in the 1988 version...too bad as am sure Zac Efron would have shown his  dancing talent too had he been given the opportunity....  This doesn't mean that the new one is less enjoyable, its just completely different and both are equally delightful and a real keeper and quality entertainment...
B000YABV90|5.0|From the trailers I knew I was going to like this movie, and as soon as it hit the street, I went to see it.... and I loved it!!  I started crying the minute the movie started, and it was not just sadness, it was a strong emotion I just couldn't resist.  What an amazing movie, Freddie Highmore's performance wonderful, as always.  He really got to me!
B000VDDDY6|5.0|I just got this set and watched the first 3 episodes. I was BLOWN AWAY. The PQ is fantastic and the audio in Dolby TrueHD is amazing (I heard some quiet dialogue and subtle audio effects I know I have never heard before) and I for one love the upgraded special effects. So far what it seems like is that they have mainly jazzed up all space shots (Enterprise and planets). It's not a whole lot, but they look awesome. I have yet to explore some of the other HD features.<br /><br />As someone else said, Season 1 of the original series was the best Star Trek there ever was. I do believe the set is overpriced (although I can see where they actually spent money on release creating this with all the new digital effects) but frankly I don't regret a penny.
B006BG7RI0|5.0|The book lets with original photos and still is stunning. All is extremely well packaged, the extra Blu-ray with the story of  Warner Brothers, created by Richard Schickel is a documentary of combined narrative and clips of pitcures. The rest of the materials had been issued before, but the whole package was worth its price, and I bought an extra one, a gift to a friend. All in all a very fine gift fro the lovers of this eternal movie.
B00005JM0B|3.0|I did not see the film in the theater after hearing many of the people involved in the first two films were not on this production.<br /><br />I did not have great expectations but I will say the film is good for a DVD viewing rather then theater prices.<br /><br />The theme of man vs machine is still at play.  It was interesting in the beginning but we know it now and it felt like space filler as there isn't an effort to expand and give it greater detail.  I probably would have liked it more if there were future scenes versus the quick dialog explaining what happened in the future. This suprised me on reflection as there is an effort into the FX aspects of the film.<br /><br />Arnold does a good job for the script he had.  I will say that he does a really good dead pan.  However, the several injections of humor seemed to take away from the killing machine we all knew.<br /><br />I did not care for Nick Stahl portrayal as John Conner.  I think they were trying to portray him as tormented but it came across as weak.  Not at all the future leader of the resistance.<br /><br />I forgot Claire Danes was in this and was surprised to see her.  Overall not a bad job for this type of genra.<br /><br />Kristanna Loken does a good job as T-X but in the back of my mind it was T-1000 as an attractive woman with the ability to turn her hand into an Energy weapon and a flame thrower.  The T-1000 thought happened after a bit of luck she finds out Conner is around and starts chasing him when she was originally sent back to terminate Conner's future Lieutenants.<br /><br />I think I would have liked it better seeing Conner remain unknown running around trying to save his future lieutenants.<br /><br />Overall the film is ok.  I admit I am probably not going to watch it much as it doesn't interest me but I would say hard fans of the series might like it as it does continue the storyline.<br /><br />The goodies dvd is not really interesting.  It has the usual commentaries , storyboards, goofs, character info and the making of the movie and games.  I watched it once and really don't see the need to view it again.I watched it once and really don't see the need to view it again.
B000066744|4.0|Legend of 1900 (1998), directed by Giuseppe Tornatore<br /><br />Tornatore favors dreamers. Here he depicts the travelers to America, in a liner full of immigrants from various parts of Europe. They arrive, get ecstatic to see the Statue of Liberty, America is in sight. But not all of them get out. A baby is born there--in 1900--and never leaves the ship. He is a gifted musician, plays the piano and composes original and exciting music, and his sidekick who plays the trumpet urges him to get out and visit New York. He stays in the ship until it blown to pieces. Tim Roth is superb as the alienated man who finds in music and the piano keys a sort of infinity which gives him all the space he requires. Whether this is a metaphor for musical eternity, or self-sufficiency, we do not know. Stylistically glamorous, the movie offers generous soundtrack music, reminding somewhat of Being There, with Peter Sellers, a man who only lived in a garden and learned life by watching TV. A sort of modern Gregor Samsa, Tim Roth, nicknamed 1900, achieves a self-willed immortality by denying any other existence but that of the self. The piano has only a definite number of notes, but its music can achieve infinity. A human being that does not need the external world. And an America on which he never sets foot, for the infinitude inside him suffices. The ship, eventually a useless wreck, is blown up, and he with it. Incidentally, by missing America, he also missed the girl, the only thing he really wanted, but lost when she left the ship. She had understood his music. But she too is absorbed by this alien world.
0553582038|4.0|Regardless if you like that this was just 1/2 of the actual book, A Feast For Crows, was well written.  It took several marginal players and gave them a whole new life.  And, as usual it made me care about even the most vile of villians.  For example, I am almost to the point of liking Jaime Lannister!    Saying that, this installment seems...lacking, for some reason.  Maybe it's the fact that there is no Jon Snow, Stannis, Daenarys, etc etc.  Maybe its the fact that so much time was spent on developing Cersei and the others. Maybe it has come to the point where the story is no longer moving forward...as its become mostly side-quest related.  Or, maybe its just that this is only 1/2 of this particular installment of the tale.  Hrmm.  Well, whatever the reason is, I know it has left me slightly unfullfilled and wanting.    So...if I am left wanting, why give it a 4 star?    Because this is still the same fabulous story we have become used to.  And, other then the fact that Cersei, Arya, and Sansa (Who becomes MUCH more likeable in this version) all piss me off....Martin is a great story teller.  Also, His work is brilliant in every facet of the game.  Need I go on?    With all that said, this is definately a must read for 2007 and \\"A Song of Fire and Ice\\" fans.  It is a must read for fantasy fans.  However, remember what I said....as this will leave you wanting, waiting, and unfullfilled.
B000V8I2QU|2.0|Disappointing. Bruce's dilemma is that he seems to have lost the knack of writing strong tunes. And this collecting is point is case.
0307165485|4.0|My mother kept my copy of this book because I loved it so much when I was a child.  I now have a three year old son and he chooses to read it before bedtime night after night.  He loves \\"Pierre Bear\\" and all the pages in between.  It's a classic and I had no idea they even sold it anymore.  Definitly an heirloom-quality book.

B000VS6P9Q|4.0|Bob Dylan has always been a mystery to both his fans and his haters. He has one major trait that Hollywood no longer produces: mystery. This is why the upcoming Dylan biopic I'm Not There is a huge deal to such a huge amount of people. They want to see inside the mystery.   But like most movies, the film was preceded by the soundtrack. A sprawling 37-song collection of Dylan covers by everyone from Jack Johnson to Willie Nelson. Some of the songs are good while others are not so good. But one thing can be made certain. Dylan himself would probably expect nothing less.   The first thing one will notice upon listening to this soundtrack is that many Dylan staples have been left out, replaced by much more obscure material by the legend. Gone are \\"Like a Rolling Stone,\\" \\"Hurricane,\\" and \\"Blowin' in the Wind,\\" among others. It's interesting that these tracks have been chosen not to be included, but one might attribute this action to one simple fact. Many people believe only Dylan can do Dylan, and especially if you're talking about those classics. I for one believe this was a good choice in that I believe only Dylan can do justice to the song \\"Hurricane.\\"    Another interesting thing about this compilation is the amount of well-known modern artists that contribute. In an age where Rihanna and 50 cent dominate the radio airwaves, many people of my generation don't even know a Bob Dylan song, much less like one. But artists like Jack Johnson, Eddie Vedder, and Sufjan Stevens all cover songs here. One can only hope that their names will lead a younger generation to the original Dylan classics.   But now we'll move on to more important stuff like answering the question of if the music is even any good. As a disclaimer I must state that I might be a bit biased in this area. I'm one of the few in my generation that not only knows who Dylan is, but actually enjoys his music. In fact, he's my favorite artist in a pretty large collection of artists from both past and present. That being said, I do believe that a majority of these songs do justice to their original counterparts. This can best be explained by the fact that none of these songs is a radical departure from their original form. All the melodies and rhythms have basically remained the same. The songs are still good and in many cases are being sung by artists with a more pleasant voice than Dylan. (Of course, we all know Dylan was never lauded for his pipes.)    I won't go in to the individual songs because those are things that people will argue about until the end of time. Some will love Yo La Tengo's gorgeous rendition of \\"4th Time Around,\\" (in my opinion) others will call it sacrilegious. But whether you like the covers or not is not the point of this compilation.    This record and the film accompanying it will once again have people talking about Dylan. And that can never be a bad thing.

1592332803|5.0|I agree wholeheartedly with all the prior great reviews of this book. It's beautiful; pictures helpful (I've always been a picture-of-final-product fan--which inspires me more to bake/cook recipes); simple, easy-to-follow recipes; wonderful traditional and new recipes; excellent results oriented recipes; and more. I've made several of the recipes with always delicious results and can't wait to try more. I want to resurrect my cranberry cheesecake (no bake) now by trying Colleen's version/recipe for sweetened condensed milk.<br /><br />But what I want to share about this book is that this appeals to ANYONE who loves to bake great desserts. I have shown the book to several non-veg co-workers whose eyes lit up when they saw the book and the plethora of delicious looking/sounding recipes inside. The book and their response have inspired me to order several books and give as gifts this holiday season. (The reasonable price and the free shipping feature here makes this quite easy.) In fact, I have already started by giving books to three cousins I recently visited in the midwest who were very impressed with the book and tried to *buy* it from me(!) But I just wanted to give it as a means for them to discover for themselves that you don't need eggs and dairy to successfully cook simple, delicious desserts!<br /><br />There is a part of vegan cooking that is very much healthier than regular standard cooking, I agree. But not everyone is interested in that part of being vegan or even non-vegans who just want to cook a little more healthfully. These others who think they want to cook more healthfully will gain a lot from this book by reading all the facts and tips about different ingredients from which to choose, one result being the absence of eggs thus no cholesterol. Non-veg folks I have shown the book to are also interested in not exploiting abuse to animals and this cookbook is a splendid example for those people--and it opens the door and their eyes that vegan desserts/cooking does not have to be a sacrifice to good old-fashion sweets. So BRAVO! to Colleen for creating this beautiful book for \\"seasoned\\" vegans, \\"beginner\\" vegetarians, and for non-vegetarians who love to bake and will have their minds opened more to the advantages of eating food that doesn't consist of any kind of animal products. This book shows exceptionally well how simple, afterall, it can be.ot have to be a sacrifice to good old-fashion sweets.

0446577391|4.0|David Baldacci shows why he is one of the best novelists working in his latest novel, \\"Stone Cold\\".  Oliver Stone aka John Carr, former C.I.A. operative and leader of the \\"Camel Club\\" has a double sided problem.  Annabelle Conroy, Carr's professional confidence woman and friend from the previous Camel Club novel is again on the run, fearing for her life. Her previous employer, Jerry Bagger, has taken offense to her stealing forty million dollars from him.    As Stone and the Camel Club attempt to assist Annabelle, another crisis arises.  It seems that someone is murdering Stone's colleagues from his C.I.A. days and Stone might just be next on the list.    Great characters, excellent pacing and an intriguing plot make for a fast-paced read.
B000002P74|5.0|Lynyrd Skynyrd's Second Helping (1974) isn't quite the monument that their debut, Pronounced, is, but taken on it's own terms, it's just as satisfying. Sweet Home Alabama is the band's biggest hit and most controversial song. Written in response to Neil Young's anti-southern rants, Southern Man and Alabama (I like both songs), the anthem was a statement in defense of southerners, not racism. Other than a vague response on his next album, On The Beach, Young has kept silent on the matter (and the south). The Ballad Of Curtis Loew is one the many highlights on Second Helping. It's a country song that tells the tale of a white kid who sells soda bottles and risks whippings to go and hear an old black bluesman play his dobro for him. The autobiographical Working For MCA is a great hard rocker, and Don't Ask Me No Questions rocks with slide guitar and a horn section. In Needle And The Spoon, Van Zant plays the part of the junkie, warning on the dangers of drug abuse. Swamp Music is a declaration of allegiance to country blues music and musicians like early blues legend, Son House, who is mentioned in the song. J.J. Cale's Call Me The Breeze is a big highlight on the album, and of Skynyrd's career. It's rocking boogie blues at it's best, with great guitar solos and a hot Billy Powell piano break. There are three very good bonus tracks, including the excellent and autobiographical Was I Right Or Wrong. Second Helping is essential for Skynyrd fans, and like Pronounced, highlights what the band could do in the studio in their early prime years. It's a great album and classic Lynyrd Skynyrd. God bless Ronnie Van Zant!
0143038419|4.0|I must give the author credit for listening to the unrest in her soul and working so hard to search for peace. I really like her and would love to have a conversation with her. Unfortunately, she offers little here in terms of spiritual guidance. She is burdened by guilt for leaving her husband. Understandable, as she seems to have left him not so much because of his flaws but because of her own inner unrest. I wish she could've taken her spiritual journey without divorcing him; it would've prevented a lot of pain. But rather than face her own culpability for his pain, her solution to her guilt is to have an imaginary conversation with him in the sky, where they work it all out beautifully. That pretty much sums up her spiritual philosophy: tell yourself what you want to hear. That'll work for a while. But it's no substitute for truth.<br />If you're looking for wisdom or a path to God - or even a commentary on good Italian food - please look elsewhere. This book doesn't have it. It's an entertaining read, but for that, it could've been a quarter of the length. Don't waste your time and money.<br />**Edit - Here it is, years after I originally wrote this review, and I feel compelled to change my 2 stars to 4, mainly because here it is, years after I originally read this book, and I'm still thinking about it. Not often, but every once in a while, it does enter my consciousness, and that alone is evidence that Elizabeth Gilbert deserves kudos for a well-written book and a deeply contemplated spiritual quest. I criticized her because her spiritual quest did not  lead her to embrace my own theological convictions. But that isn't fair. She encountered God, she pursued Him, she found her peace, and she generously shared her experience with the world. And for that, respect.
B000VAPZM2|3.0|Not in the age demographic at all, this said I hated the first movie.  It was too cookie cutter clean, and not all that realistic in it's portrayal of the age range it depicted.   However I know its Disney and who it was targeted for so I didn't really expect anything else.  I just didn't like it.    The sequel though, was much better of a movie, and the songs were much better.  I wouldn't run out an tell everyone it was a must see, but I was a fun time.    I don't understand a earlier comment/review talking about Zac's solo song and how it had backing vocals with him being the only one on screen.  If you are going to go with that train of thought then there should also be NO music accompanying ever.  That is unless you start singing at random moments in your life and there is also music too.    If that be the case you probably need a bit more help than most..
0316067598|5.0|this guy is a stud.  It is a real testimony of how the human body works.  The author spends a lot of time setting up the story through the training the seals go through, and only through that set up can you truly understand how these guys keep going and going, they have no quit in them whatsoever and it shows.  You will be amazed as I was, a great read, enjoy
B0001FR3IQ|4.0|This is a great movie- a bit disturbing, but it's supposed to be. It's not gory, but it is graphic. I wouldn't let young kids watch this...
0743486285|5.0|Someone mentioned in an early review that ok but only if you can relate, I think a lot of people can relate, you just have to think about what you are reading, because what you are seeing is the descension into insanity that a person who is addicted goes through, and its not an easy thing to deal with.  Its even harder to see what it will be like on the other side once you are past your addiction and clean and sober, and its even harder in this day and age to stay that way, so I commend Sixx for sharing this with all of us out there and appreciate it greatly!
B00005JPLW|5.0|This is a great movie- the effects are fantastic! It is a bit bloody- but not in the sensless point of gushing blood being the focus of the movie (like SAW and other crappy movies).
B00008S2VG|5.0|I think is a good album, but not necessarily cohesive.     The marketing was bad and it seems as if Madonna was pushed to portray a militar girl instead of the spiritual and honest person she tries to achieve on this album.       Along with Ray of Light and Confessions on a Dancefloor, this ranks among my Madonna favorites.
B00005JPFH|2.0|This movie really disappointed me. Venom was the best part of the entire movie. Peter Parker's little dance scene in the bar was rediculous- half the people in the theater got up and went to the bathroom and the other half were thowing pop corn at the screen. It was not good. My boyfriend likes it just because he's a die hard spidey fan (which is why I gave it two stars and not one)- but if he weren't, there'd be NO WAY anyone could convince me to spend money on it.

When it finally came out, I was blown away.  The video is absolutely breathtaking.  And what is ever more amazing is that each episode showed me things I not only had never seen before, it showed me things I have never HEARD OF before!  When I bought my Blu-ray player, it was with this series alone in mind.  I cannot applaud The Planet Earth enough.  BRAVO!

0784011710|5.0|I first saw \\"Sophie's Choice\\" in 1982, when it came out in theatres. Shortly thereafter, I read the William Styron novel on which it is based. In the past 25 years (hard to imagine it has been that long ago) I have watched the movie many times, and reread the novel 4 or 5 times as well. I won't recount the outlines of the story (see the many customer reviews for that), but simply wish to say that of all the movies I've watched, this is the one that is most enduring, and in such a haunting, complex way. I think the ultimate test of a great movie is time - and after 25 years, this film continues to move me, and to linger again long after the final credits have rolled. All the aspects of a great movie are here: acting (incomparable by Meryl Streep), story-telling (I think it's one of the best translations of a novel to the big screen), cinematography (the shots of Sophie's face as she recounts her grim past to Stingo are almost artwork), and musical score (haunting, and deeply sorrowful,yet somehow hopeful).<br />Also, the story works on several levels, as a history of the Holocaust (as seen from one person's experience), as a study on the nature of evil (and the devastating effects of a survivor's guilt), and ultimately, as a love story.....rising paradoxically above all the grief. The final images of this powerful film are indelible, and life-affirming.<br />The documentary that accompanies the movie on the DvD is also quite informative, and includes many interesting insights from the actors, the director, Styron himself, and two Holocaust survivors, who bear witness to the very real tragedies of the many real-life Sophies whom were \\"among the butchered and martyred children of this earth.\\"<br />Wilfred Owen, the great English poet who died in the trenches of WWI once wrote, in a preface to a volume of his poetry: \\"My subject is not poetry, but war, and the pity of war....the poetry is in the pity.\\"<br />\\"Sophie's Choice\\" is a movie that will touch a similar poetry in the human heart. Over and over again.art. Over and over again.
B000W4HJ44|5.0|This movie is the best musical to come out of hollywood in years. From the very first song your feet get to tapping and don't stop. Zac Effron and Nikki Blonsky make quite the onscreen couple. Every dance and song are pefect, I have not seen the Broadway Musical but if it is this good it should win a Tony every year. I hope that this gets nominated for a Golden Globe in the Musical or Comedy category and that John Travolta gets nominated for a golden globe as well as Nikki Blonsky. Nikki Blonsky has the voice of a seasoned broadway veteran, she is a vocal powerhouse!

B000VLE3GA|5.0|Here come our old friends Led Zep again...hmmm, what could they possibly have now that I would want? Could it be new songs? Well, no.  Maybe some newly discovered, thought lost forever tapes hidden away all these years in Jimmy Pages closet? No, again. WELL THEN WHAT COULD IT BE??? It's a greatest hits CD, of course!     Isn't it curious that new interest can be created from resurrecting an already well known catalog of tunes, repackaged with the promise of being something new and interesting, and resold yet again to an already adoring public. It can be done but only if the existing product can be improved upon, again. It's been my contention for years that Led Zeppelin has not been heard in the digital age the way they should be. The vindication of that fact can now found in this newly remastered release. The key here is the remastering. Slip on a pair of quality headphones, insert one of these CD's and settle back for what John Davis of Alchemy Mastering in London was able to do. My hat is off to Mr. Davis, he has taken what was digitized from some aged tapes circa the nineteen seventies, extracted all that is possible with current audio technology, and then for the grand finale mixed it all correctly. Hey, when you can clearly hear noises like drum hardware squeaking you get the feeling Davis pulled everything out of those geriatric tapes that is possible. Listen to the beginning of \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" I believe it's Bonham's \\"Speed King\\" bass drum pedal that's the source of the now very audible squeaking. Although most of the selections are now clear as a bell be warned, as is true with many older analog recordings the source limitations sometimes are glaringly obvious. For example \\"The Immigrant Song\\" was apparently not a very good quality recording to begin with. You can tell Davis polished it up as much as he could but in my opinion it still suffers from a limited dynamic range and an abundance of tape hiss, listen at the very beginning as someone counts the song in and you'll hear the large amount of hiss until the band starts up. One must not be too picky though, after all that song was recorded, and I hate to say it, about 35 years ago. Anyway, the remastering was expertly handled and the end result is a clear winner. I think this is the best the public is going to get from those source recordings for a long time. Compare the sound quality on this CD compilation to the other Led Zeppelin CD's in your collection and I think you'll agree.
B00005JPS5|3.0|\\"Why is yogurt night so hard?\\"<br /><br />\\"Bee Movie\\", the new animated film created by Jerry Seinfeld, with the voices of Seinfeld, Renee Zellweger, Patrick Warburton, Matthew Broderick and John Goodman, is a cute film. Too cute.<br /><br />The title is a play on words, and this is about as edgy as the humor gets. B Movie is a term that used to be applied to a film made by a studio that was paired with a more expensive, more prestigious film. Basically, a second film used to fill out a double bill to give the customer the feeling they have received their money's worth. Generally, they were made by directors less respected by the studio and starred either new, up and coming actors or actors who needed a paycheck. \\"Bee Movie\\" is about Barry the Bee (Seinfeld). Get it.<br /><br />Barry and his best friend, Adam (Matthew Broderick) graduate from Bee College and immediately find they face a decision; they must choose the job they will do for the rest of their lives. But Barry wants to se the outside world, so he tags along with a group of bees that are charged with collecting pollen. Flying through the outside world, Barry's eyes are opened by all New York has to offer and he meets a human, Vanessa Bloome (Renee Zellweger), a flower shop owner (get it?) who befriends him from the buffoon (Patrick Warburton) who wants to be her boyfriend. As their friendship blooms, Barry learns humans have harvested a lot of honey, stolen it from the bees and decides to take them to court to get it back. It sounds like a good idea, but when he wins, an unexpected thing happens and he has to make everything right.<br /><br />The film is sprinkled with humor. Every now and then, Barry has a Seinfeld-like rift on what he is observing as a bee in the outside world. And some of the characters have memorable lines. For instance, the buffoon (Warburton) who wants to become Vanessa's boyfriend, is upset when she cancels Yogurt night. \\"Why is Yogurt night so hard?\\" he bellows as the door is shut in his face.<br /><br />And the environment of the hive is interesting; as the film begins, the animators take us on a whirlwind tour of the hive and all of the various aspects of it. This is a fast paced moment and provides for some neat visual gags.<br /><br />When Barry takes his flight with the rest of the bees who venture out of the hive, the animators have some fun with the flight, swooping in and out of box kites, through trees, across the New York landscape.<br /><br />The biggest problem with \\"Bee Movie\\" lies in the animation. It is well done but the style of the characters is too cutesy. As soon as I saw Barry and Adam walking through the hive, I immediately thought of a picture book for children. The animation is very stylized and far removed from reality, which is a good thing because a realistic bee probably wouldn't be too fun to watch. But they have, perhaps, gone too far in the other direction. Barry and all of his brethren resemble a Disney Baby version of a bee. A few years ago, Disney began creating Disney Baby versions of Mickey, Pluto, Donald, Minnie, Goofy and the rest of the brood, that are much rounder, softer, and cuter. Perfect for little babies and newborns, extending the Disney brand by capturing the kids even earlier. The bees look like that, rounder, softer, and cuter.<br /><br />If this were the only example of this, of catering to the very youngest crowd, it would probably be okay. But there seems to be a conscious effort to gear the entire film for this age range. The humor is light and less sardonic or biting than you might find. The story is a little simplistic. The acting is a bit broad. I think that you will find in any `classic' animated film the filmmakers have made a conscious effort to cater to both young and old. In all of the modern Disney classics, the animation is beautiful and strives to be as lifelike as possible. While they may include talking (or singing) animals, they also include humor geared specifically for adults and maybe even a little danger or threat. This makes these films enjoyable for the adults who are required to bring the kids to the theaters in the first place. And when those kids grow up, they remember the films with fond memories, introducing them to their children.<br /><br />\\"Bee Movie\\" isn't bad, it just isn't fast-paced enough to keep the adults in the audience enthralled. There is a scene late in the film in which Barry and Vanessa are traveling to California on a plane. Very quickly, things spiral out of control and Barry and Vanessa find themselves in control of the plane. There is a moment when Barry tries to explain to Vanessa what happened, which is the closest thing we have to the \\"Seinfeld\\" humor you would expect from him. It is a funny line and more of the same type of humor would have helped to make the film more memorable.<br /><br />\\"Bee Movie\\" has its moments, but I can't help but think the film is appropriately named. It will most likely be a B movie in comparison to the best Disney has to offer and anything Pixar ever does.ms enjoyable for the adults who are required to bring the kids to the theaters in the first place.

B000VNMMR0|4.0|I was a little skeptical before watching this film. Bruce has gotten much older since the original \\"Die Hard\\" and the world, as well as movies in general, have changed a lot. I was wondering if the latest outing in the Die Hard franchise was going to be a cheesy, tiresome, re-hash of what we've seen before.    I'm happy to say that I was proven wrong. \\"Live Free\\" starts off with a bang and doesn't let up until the very end. Not only does Bruce pull off the role of a much older and much more cynical John McClane, he does it with style and believability.    The stunts and action scenes are some of the best I've seen in a long time. The pace of the film only slows down long enough to fill the viewer in on some important details and plot devices and then gets right back to it. There was one stunt, however, that did seem a little too unrealistic to me (just watch for yourself and see if you can pick it out), which, for me, took away from the movie's credibility causing me to dedcut 1/2 of a star from the rating.    The other half star was deducted from my review because of the strange coloration of the film. Everything seemed to be either black, dark blue, grey, or olive which gave the film an overall dark tone which, I guess, was done to match its doomsday theme. To me, though, it was a distraction. The other films in the franchise were colored normally, so why should this one be any different? Oh well. A little detail like this probably won't bother anyone else.    Overall, I enjoyed this one much more than \\"Die Hard 2\\" and \\"Die Hard: With a Vengeance\\", but not as much as the first \\"Die Hard\\". It's a great action film with an interesting premise, some terrific stunts, and amazing special effects and action sequences. This movie should be enough to satisfy any action film junkie.

0618680004|5.0|Buy this book if you would like to read a book that clearly puts forward the atheist world view with out the emotionalism or anger that usually accompanies atheist authors. Mr. Dawkins acknowledges that even though no one can be 100% sure whether God exists, a reasonable person that is equipped with biblical knowledge and a fundamental knowledge of science can believe with almost certainity that there is no God, and if such a being exists the Deity is certainly not the Judeo-Christian God of the Bible and Church history. Mr. Dawkins leaves no stone unturned, he boldly explains why the bible is not the word of God from the errors of Jesus's geneology in Matthew and Luke (The number of generations vary by over 13 in his lineage from David), also he explains how you would be hard pressed to find a more petty God than the one that exists in the Old Testament.<br />Mr. Dawkins also does an excellent job in explaining that evolution does not claim chance created all evolved life. Natural selection is the mechanism that causes DNA to adapt and survive to changing environments. The big point is that saying God created life in its complex forms does not solve the origin of life, it simply moves it to God, who created God?<br /> The author believes that religion is a very dangerous delusion perpetrated on children at young ages. It is a form of brain washing that has no place in our modern world. The point of the book is that the glory of the universe and the mystery of science is adequate to fill the void that is left from the burden of religion.<br /> This book is the best one I have found on the market for a clear logical, rational presentaion of atheism. A must read for all serious students of truth, science, and religion. It may free you from a burden you were not aware you carried. Or it will make you a more thoughtful and well spoken atheist. I wish I could have read this book before I embarked on my decade of Christian Fundamentalism.
B000Y179KO|5.0|I love this CD!!! It is rare, in my experience, that someone ( or a group of someones) who has been out of sight for such a long time would return with material as good as the older songs that made them famous. But, in my opinion, this material is every bit as good as the old Eagles material. My only complaint is I would have liked a little more Joe Walsh, and I love the songs he has written for this. But there are only one or two songs I can live without, the rest are exceptional. The voices and the instrumentation are excellent. Great job guys!!! It is good to have you back!!!
B000VNMMQG|5.0|This is a beautiful, epic film with so many different dimensions that make the heart-soul soar!!  I realized shortly after the end of it that I need to see it again and view from another perspective. We see Wilburforce's frustration with his tireless efforts not coming to fruition, and as it unfolds, we see that in a way, he too is enslaved--to the opiate painkiller, laudanum.  Looking back from the ending, we see that all his tireless and frustrated efforts for so long did not come to fruition until he was finally able to conquer his addiction, so that his newborn son would see and know the \\"real\\" (drug-free) Wilburforce.  Both Wilburforce and his cloistered former preacher-former slaveowner Newton were plagued by personal demons of conscience, and it was only when they faced these demons and solemnly vowed to not be ruled by them with the help of Holy God,  that their dreams of abolishing the slave trade finally came to fruition.    One additional comment:  For all who have been soured/jaded by outward, institutional religion and legalism, this film is not a \\"religious\\" or \\"Christian Bible Pounding\\" film.  It is a historical-political film in which 2 men's souls were moved by the unseen Spirit of God to break the bonds of slavery, over persons bought/sold by men,  and over free men whose souls are under enemy occupation by the demons of addiction.  This is a soaring, uplifting film of epic proportions.
0316067598|5.0|I saw Navy Seal Luttrell being interviewed on \\"The O'Reilly Factor.\\"  I later heard that \\"Lone Survivor\\" was being made into a movie, (a counter to the anti-War, anti-US propaganda, \\"Rendition\\", \\"Lambs to Lions,\\" etc.).  I was prompted to buy the book.  While reading the indepth story of \\"Lone Survivor\\" tears formed in my eyes as I learned of the dedication, heriosm, and love of country with which these fine Americans serve.  Also, I might add, the mutual support of family, friends, neighbors, and comrades in arms, would make the most hardened Code Pink fanatic see reality.  Read this book!

B000MXPE7O|2.0|I got lost more times than I have fingers watching this movie. The story keeps switching back and forth between 1961-65 and 1939-45. Now it does tell you at the bottom of the screen what year you're in but it switched so mamy times that I got lost once and couldn't figure out if I was in the 40's or the 60's and to tell you the truth at that point of this almost 3 hour movie. I really didn't care. I also had trouble keeping track of who all the characters were. The director does not do a good job of explaining things. You just have to figure it all out for yourself. And though I did watch the whole movie and I do understand what it's about. I think I would have to watch it about 2 more times to really get everything. But I'm just not willing to invest 9 hours on this. I'm sorry I wasted the 3. I watched it with my girlfriend and we kept asking each other \\"Do you understand what's going on\\"?, \\"Who's this person\\"?, \\"what year are we in\\"?      I have other issues with this movie other than the convoluted story. The whole movie is filmed very, VERY, dark! It's like you're watching it with sunglasses on. There's one part in the movie when they get a russian spy to cross to their side, and they pretty much just take him at his word and consider him one of them. Later on in the movie another russian claims to be the same guy and wants to cross and says that the other Russian is a mole. Instead of taking this guy at his word, they torture him for several hours and when he sticks to his story they give him LSD as a truth serum and not only does he STILL stick to his story but he jumps out the window killing himself. All this gives the agents NO reason to believe that the guy they're trusting MIGHT actually be the mole!!! They don't torture him, they don't even question him. They just go on believing him. And guess what. He turns out to be the mole. Matt Damon finds this out by noticing a feather coming out of a book that one of his spy friends gave the mole. He then peels back the inside cover of the book reveiling a passport and other incriminating evidence. I mean this is truly stupid and really made the whole movie stupid. If you're going to make a movie this confusing it better at least be good and make sense and this movie does not. And why is Joe Pessci in this movie??? His Character is meaningless from what I can tell. Robert DiNero - A Bronx Tale this is not! Try again.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|I think this movie should be watched by all the people who feel (at least) slightly disappointed with their governments and the society they live in. It is a very powerful example of what could happen if people got together and did something. The government should be afraid of people, not the contrary.

B000000OAH|4.0|Queen released their seventh album in November of 1978 entitled 'Jazz' which in the chorus of the title track contained..\\"more of that jazz\\" meaning a another solid but unspectacular outing from the band critics loved to hate. An explosion of song styles as if Queen were trying to be all things to all people...or was this diversity only to please themselves. Pop, country, sappy ballads, funk/disco and even metal were showcased on this record along with a truly bizarre opener (what the hell was \\"Mustapha\\" anyway...arabic rock????!!!). 'Jazz' was no better than or worse than the previous two lps and did contain its share of hits. Favorites include \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\" with its delicious harmonies and dynamite guitar sound....just a skinny lad (not with those power chords). \\"Bicycle Race\\" was the quirky hit, similar in style to \\"Killer Queen\\" in which it contained pomp, outrageous (and dated) lyrics and diverse arrangements. \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\" should have been a bigger hit than it was with Freddie, a larger than life character, celebrating his party existence...too mister farenheidt for mainstream America? Metal and hard rock are served well in \\"Dead on Time\\" with another guitar workout from Brian and \\"Let Me Entertain You\\" another rhythmic hard rocker from Freddie. John Deacon offers \\"If You Can't Beat Them\\", his first true rocker and \\"In Only Seven Days\\", one of his typical ballads. Roger Taylor's songs are usually hit or miss...title track is darn good, \\"Fun It\\" just blows. Maybe Queen was trying to hard here, but their fans didn't care...football gives us thrills....rock and roll just pays the bills.

B000002AGN|4.0|It seems so long ago for me that I \\"discovered\\" the Dave Brubeck Quartet.  Yet the artistry and melodies still weave a compelling magic. The experiments with time signatures coupled with the impeccable playing of all the members of the quartet create a timeless [ no pun intended] masterpiece of Jazz.  The lyrical piano of Brubeck is complemented with the sauve tones and improvisations of Paul Desmond.  The chord progressions and melody development reveal a symbiotic \\"cool'. this is briliantly supported by Joe Merello, who takes the expiments to another realm as the lynch pin for the next album - Time Further Out.  Merello is supported ably by Eugene Wright on Bass. It is hard to believe that this was recorded in 1959, the melodies, their improvisations and the experimentation is still fresh and up lifting.

B00011RPB0|4.0|The title says it all. I read multiple reviews of Lost in Translation and hesitated...do I want to invest an hour and a half of my life into this film?<br /><br />Finally, I had a quiet few moments, an opportunity presented itself and I decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />I can understand the mixed reviews. If you are expecting a movie that ties up any sort of loose ends or follows a plot, you aren't going to like it. If you are expecting Bill Murray to be hilarious, you might want to look into one of his classic films. Looking for pure entertainment and story? You probably won't enjoy the movie.<br /><br />This is a piece that reveals those icky insecurities and quirks that we all carry and transfer to our relationships. Any human interactions are subject to our own filters and life is a series of our interacting filters meshing or rejecting, not unlike differing languages and customs. All the details of life are subject to translation or interpretation and exactly what the movie is about -- the miscommunication small and large that guide us, govern us and control us.<br /><br />The characters are lost, emotionally, as they try to figure out what they are looking for in life, in careers, in the bottom of booze bottles and in other people. Several reviews mentioned feeling depressed after watching the film. Possible, but depends on whether or not you are in that cycle -- the search without knowing what you search for.<br /><br />Great acting. Deep characterization. Interesting theme. A study of humanity in all its complexity. Looking for pure, simple entertainment? Look elsewhere.

B000TM1CKQ|5.0|We started watching this show midway through season one at the reccommedation of a family member. It quickly became our favorite, and we waited with anticipation every week to watch, even if we knew it would be a rerun.   The relationship between the characters is much more realistic than with the show \\"Friends\\" (where everyone is so nice and mature with each other and every ending is sickenly sweet). HIMYM shows TRUE friendships - the joking around, mocking each other, plenty of inside jokes (that they share with the viewer, and of course, helping each other out.  The running gags they have (Robin's Canadian accent and heritage, slap bet, and... oh, I don't want to ruin it for the 'virgin' viewers.)    Just buy it. You will not regret it.

0553588486|3.0|I am over half way through this book and although its pretty well done, I would say the story and writing are pretty average so far.  There are a few interesting ideas like the long winter, but over all it seems pretty straight forward fantasy.  The author hits the romance of hereditary monarchy a bit hard while also clearly showing why it is one of the worst possible forms of government.  The pace is a bit slow too, which is not surprising for 800 pages.<br /><br />One minor annoyance is that there are so many story lines that it often happens that the reader knows more of the whole story than an individual character.  This leads to cases where you are waiting for some of the main characters to get a clue (why do you THINK the previous royal adviser was interested in the king's illegitimate children?).<br /><br />I almost didn't read this because of one of the reviews talking about a 13/14 year old girl and sex scenes.  Its not nearly as disturbing as they made it sound.  The girl is a married princess and although the marriage was forced, the sex does not seem to be.  Marriages that young were common in monarchies in the real world, and even for common people when the average life expectancy was 30 something people married younger.  Its also a very minor part of the book and her eventual pregnancy is a main part of the plot.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|Strangers in the Night by UFO is one of the greatest live albums ever made. It holds up as well today as it did when first released in the late seventies.

The fierce, thrashing sound of this five-man power band will hold you in thrall from beginning to end.
B000PDZJ1W|5.0|Well, in a time of re-packaging an artist's backcatalog, it sometimes can be a nice ride. Depeche Mode have done so with giving us thirty-minute movies about the group at the time and giving audio parts of the DVD with out-takes from the album. Six years doesn't do a lot digitally to change the sound but if you want what's involved for the time, this was a good treat to the fans. The thing is, \\"Exciter\\" is an album I've ALWAYS felt was VERY unfairly hated. Sure, it's not like everything DM does, it's more minimal, etc., but if you are open minded about that kind of direction it may *actually* work for you.    Six years later and I still can't get enough. Nearly half of the album is classic Depeche Mode, and that's considering when 2 of the songs are pretty much interludes. Admittedly I felt cheated when I learned that \\"Easy Tiger\\" wasn't just going to be released in its long form as a full song because I liked that one quite a bit. This re-release sort of makes a way to make up for the fact.    \\"Dream On,\\" \\"The Sweetest Condition,\\" \\"The Dead of Night,\\" \\"Comatose,\\" and \\"I Am You\\" are all five Depeche Mode classics. The latter is a great mix of acoustics and a trip-hop style beat. At times parts seem creepy and sinister in the instrumentation, but no one can deny the classic chorus. \\"The Sweetest Condition\\" may remind people of a [[ASIN:B000002LK1 Violator]] song with the same title, but I feel that they are unique enough from each other that it distinguishes. I love its romantic feel and it's also the same kind of feel in \\"I Am You.\\" The song's so good that I think if I got married that I would consider that for the main music. It is very melodic and the romantic feel in every way matches this record and is something Depeche were always great with doing. \\"Comatose\\" pretty much lives up to its title; definitely unlike anything from the group but an excellent track which Gore himself sings. \\"The Dead of Night\\" is a real surprise. I can't blame people for not liking that song but it's a real winner with me, with its lyrics and its noisiness and everything else in it really matches together. I often find myself singing along with the pre-chorus, which shows that even when they may otherwise seem tuneless that they can even still be melodic.    I didn't even get into \\"I Feel Loved\\" and \\"Goodnight Lovers,\\" both singles and excellent songs, pretty close to being on par with the other five mentioned. The latter was later ripped off in its beat by Dirty Vegas in \\"Days Go By\\" but the songs also give different sorts of feels. The lyrics are pretty simple and the song is probably the most dance-y thing on the whole record. It proves that even when making mellow music you can have something with some real life in it. \\"Goodnight Lovers\\" is total aural bliss. The additional vocals make me feel like it's some soundtrack to heaven itself or something and even if the \\"soul sisters/soul brothers\\" lyric in the chorus feels forced to some it doesn't really even taint the song. It ends \\"Exciter\\" on the right note and a pretty high one.    Admittedly they could have maybe taken off the somewhat pointless interlude \\"Lovetheme\\" and \\"Breathe\\" in spite its high Biblical references, is not a highly interesting song. Still tolerable, but it may have been better off as a B-side. Works well as filler in the album's context though.    The other songs mentioned aren't bad, but I'd say they are standard fare for the band. Although many of those also give the album a relaxed feel. And just when you thought Gore sung all the slow love ballads you get Gahan singing on \\"Freelove,\\" which is also offered in its single mix on the DVD of it. I admittedly like that one more but feel that the version on this album fits the feel of the album better.    I feel that any real Depeche Mode fan should give this record a second spin. In spite some of the criticisms it's received it is still a pretty unique record and a mildly big suprise. After the darker and heavier two (stillgreat) albums before it, the band got over some of its tensions and was finally able to write something with a different feel and a truly matured sounding Depeche record. In spite how mellow it is I don't find it boring in the least. It works a hypnotic feel good and after \\"Waiting for the Night\\" how could you NOT want that in an album. Oh, and you can tell by the title of a B-side where I got the name from, although I put a lame twist to it by spicing it into two words. A nice instrumental track. Also look out for a remake of the Stooges' \\"Dirt\\" which also was included on the [[ASIN:B000062Y7M Resident Evil]] soundtrack. I know it's irritating to find an album on the market again so soon after its release, but no one is telling you to buy this either. But go ahead and buy it twice, anyway.
0743270754|5.0|No doubt many of the other reviewers are better informed of the details of Abe Lincoln's life and political career than I was when I picked up this book.  Of course, I knew the man's reputation.  That is, after all, pretty hard to miss.  But beyond the general information, freeing the slaves, leading the country through the Civil War, etc., I could not have given someone the details as to exactly why Lincoln is so esteemed.  Thanks to Doris Kearns Goodwin and her book TEAM OF RIVALS, now I can.    Although the book is focused specifically on Lincoln's political genius in handling his prickly and often disagreeable cabinet, that subject is still broad enough to prevent anything other than a cursory overview in a review.  The details of Lincoln's political savvy are truly incredible.  He won the 1860 Republican nomination not by being the favorite, but rather by being the second pick of the supporters of everyone else running.  More conservative than some, more radical than others, he positioned himself perfectly to obtain the nod when William Seward, Salmon Chase and Edward Bates found themselves at a stalemate.  Despite the differences among these other candidates, and despite the fact that they treated Lincoln as a country bumpkin not worthy of their time prior to his winning the presidential nomination, Lincoln nonetheless, recognizing their talents and the need the country had for the best available men, brought them into his cabinet.  The result was quite possibly the most talented, yet often acrimonious, cabinet in the history of the American presidency.    Seward, stung by the loss of the prize he considered his, came to recognize Lincoln's preeminence.  As Secretary of State he could not have been more loyal to Lincoln and the two became exceptionally close friends.  The same, however, cannot be said for Chase, who never overcame the feeling that the lesser man won.  Chase attempted to undermine Lincoln's presidency from the get go.  Lincoln recognized this but, as the country had need of Chase's talents in the Treasury Department, put up with it until the time was right to call Chase's bluff and accept his resignation.  Even then, again putting the country's needs over his own ego, Lincoln made Chase Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, recognizing the need for a Supreme Court willing to pave the way for Lincoln's vision of Southern Reconstruction.    Lincoln's ability to overcome slights and animosities is displayed over and over again.  When he first met Edwin Stanton on the legal circuit, Stanton treated him with contempt, not wholly unjustified as legally Lincoln was not even in Stanton's league.  Yet Stanton not only became head of the War Department but also, like many others, came to recognize that his initial opinion of Lincoln was way, way off the mark.      Lincoln not only walked the tightrope without misstep with respect to the competing personalities and egos of the members of his cabinet, but did so also with respect to the political issues revolving around the civil war.  From preventing European powers from recognizing the Confederacy as a sovereign nation to keeping several border slave states within the Union rather than seceding while at the same time advocating the eventual abolition of slavery itself, Lincoln demonstrated an understanding of human nature almost unsurpassed among politicians.  If one wanted to believe that the existence of the United States really is some example of Divine Providence, that such a man arose during this country's darkest hour would be an excellent place to start the argument.  I usually hate such stock phrases, but TEAM OF RIVALS really is the type of book everyone should read.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|This album is the first true Alterbridge collaborative effort. Much of the last album was written before Myles Kennedy came aboard to sing, and the sound was not much different than what we previously knew these boys for.  It was a bit louder, and faster, but still more of the inspirational, push yourself music.  This album adds Myles on Guitar and vocals, and also adds more credits to his writing list.  The flow of the songs and the interactions of all pieces come together much more naturally than the last album.  Tracks like Ties That Bind blow me out of the water, sonding very old school thrash at times.  the vocals are not overpowering, which is a peave of mine, and they were able to avoid with thier sound.  This album is meant to fill an arena with sound, but can be listened to in a car turned full volume.  Crank this up and go.      FYI: two major retailers have special versions of this, one with two bonus tracks, and one with a bonus DVD with the making of.  Either place, great deal pick this album up.
B000ENBSL8|1.0|This book really tries too hard. I read through the first several chapters, and was so bored with it, I accidentally left it on a plane. Now I have to buy a copy to replace my library's, although I do not wish this book on anyone. There are better novels out there worthy of your time & money. Maybe the end gets better, but I don't think you should have to suffer through the first part of a book just for a happy ending.
B0002IU988|4.0|When I heard creed boke up, I cheered.  I didn't care for thier music. It was overplayed, and Scott Stapp's voice was nails on a blackboard to me. Always sounds like he has marbles in his mouth.  I didn't expect much from this formation of Creed as the new \\"Alterbridge\\", but I realized that after you take away the annoying vocals of creed, the music was usually pretty heavy and good.  This album is still a bit close to creed for me, since most of it was written prior to Myles Kennedy signing on.  The vocals at time are a bit to the fore front more than I like, and the lyrics are a bit light for me also, but the sound was developing.  Tracks like Burn It Down and Metalingus sold me on this album.  They are a bit heavier, and are meant to fill an arena with sound.  Pick this album up and see what this incarnation can bring.
B000002H3E|5.0|Dokken's 'Under Lock And Key' is a shining example of truly great, quality hard rock/metal songwriting!  Don's voice is powerful, sexy, emotional, and as professional as they come- clearly one of the best in the biz.  George Lynch is a MONSTER riff and lead guitarist, with lyrical, melodic, and aggressive leads that are so technically and sonically good, they sound like 'mini-songs' unto themselves!  Gritting your teeth, and clenching your fists will come naturally listening to this MASTERPIECE!  It sounds just as 'fresh' today as it did back then.  Dokken FOREVER!
0743298039|3.0|Diane Setterfield's writing style is engrossing and her shifting through time and character make the book a enjoyable read- keeping your interest. The story though has too many predictable plot lines and overly dramatic behavior and endings for characters. Maybe one character in a novel has abnormal or outrageous behavior, but this book is packed with them. The ending is a twist, but you know it will be because Satterfield has done it to you several times already. It has some heart grabbing moments and is a bit on the scary side at times, but leaves you feeling a somewhat unsatisfied since you constantly know where she's taking the book, based on over foreshadowing.

080701429X|5.0|This is a small book with a big subject - life and meaning -  written in 1946 and first published in 1959.  Only recently it has been published in English.  It still rings true, written by a Nazi concentration camp inmate, Dr. Viktor Frankl.  He originally wanted to be an anonymous author; however, his friends persuaded him to publish under his own name to give the book credibility.  Readers could therefore also understand this is a psychiatrist's objective view of suffering, which is part of life, and why life and hope prevail in the darkest moments.<br /><br />Part One, Experiences in a Concentration Camp is key to all he learned on the meaning of life.  The horrible losses and inhumanity are seared into your mind, but when Dr. Frankl looks at the horror with educated eyes, he recognizes courage, objectivity and responsibility as vital for survival.  This is a story of a man who was sent to the concentration camp with a belief that if he had to suffer and die, it would be significant: he would not suffer nor die for nothing.<br /><br />Dr. Frankl reviews the fight for survival and his decisions that somehow help him survive.  He notes that prisoners go through three phases, 1)shock: the period following his admission 2)apathy: the period where they they become well entrenched in camp routine, and 3)the sense of loss, where they lose everything but hope.  He digs down deep in his own soul to helps others to go on and have meaning in their life - not to give up and find the basic motivation to go on. He teaches despairing men \\"that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but what life expected from us.\\"  Dr. Frankl repeats, \\"if we have the \\"why\\" we will always find the \\"how\\" to go on.\\"<br /><br />This book shows each individual he is important and every decision he makes is impactful.  Therefore, make the right decisions and be triumphant.  Right decisions cause the least pain and give the most love for fellow man.  It is what gives us hope and value as part of humanity.<br /><br />Part Two, Logo-Therapy in a Nutshell, was not as interesting to me.  It describes Frankl's philosophy of logo-therapy and reminded me of of mid-eastern religions as well as Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.  It is a way  (Frankl calls it \\"neo-dynamics\\") to have a goal in mind and achieve it no matter what obstacles and stress you are facing.  The things that make life important and with meaning are different for each of us.  All of us can have a meaning of life, but the \\"big picture meaning\\" is hard to understand.  It takes us a lifetime of good and bad events and decisions to shape us.<br /><br />Part Three, is a postscript on \\"Tragic Optimism\\" and states that despite the \\"tragic triad\\" (as it is called in Logo-Therapy) 1)pain, 2)guilt, and 3)death - how is it possible to say yes to life in spite of all that?  Logo-therapy teaches there are three main avenues on which one arrives at meaning in life.  The first is creating a work or by doing a deed.  The second is by experiencing something or encountering someone, and the third is turning a personal tragedy into a triumph.  He mentions using bad situations as a growth experience.<br /><br />Overall a deep book but a good book on looking at life.  It shows that each one of us can determine personal meaning and why it is important.Part Two, Logo-Therapy in a Nutshell, was not as interesting to me.

0743464117|5.0|'Band of Brothers' by Stephen Ambrose<br /><br />A fabulous military chronicle that, in my opinion, was the first able to truly chronicle warfare at the company level.  You're introduced to one of the finest military heroes to serve in World War II in Major Richard Winters as well as the other members of the brotherhood that was Easy Company.  Trace the amazing journey of this remarkable outfit as they join the only recently assembled 101st Airborne in Camp Toccoa, GA where they were hardened in one of the most rigorous training programs the US military had to offer.  Onto the pre-dawn drops into Normandy prior to the ensuing land and sea invasion which heavily relied on successful airborne mission completion.  The jaw dropping adventure does not stop there: Easy Company enjoys a brief respite before being shipped out for their liberation of Holland to holding the line in the infamous Battle of The Bulge in the Ardennes Forest of Belgium.  As if \\"The Battered Bastards of Bastogne\\" had not faced enough, off they trek to liberate several Belgium towns before finally crossing German soil and eventually capturing Berchtesgaden and Hitler's Eagle Nest - a prize also vigorously sought by the French & British.<br /><br />If you've seen the mini-series and thought you got the full story, please read the book.  Not only was the movie forced to cut out several important engagements, but Ambrose does an amazing job providing texture and depth to the many characters, small and large, participating in this truly remarkable war story.  The movie, as wonderful as it is, cannot do justice to the heroes of Easy Company, 506 PIR, 101st Airborne.  You will not be disappointed.

B000MQ58VI|5.0|Disney's Chicken Little is a fun adventure of a misunderstood chicken who has a hard time getting his father to be proud of him.  My first viewing of this film was a little underwhelming - I was expecting a little more \\"realism\\" than \\"looney toon\\", keeping in mind all of the great Pixar movies that Disney's released.  However, my second viewing was much more enjoyable.  While the humor of the movie is much more Saturday morning cartoon, the message is aimed at both adults and children - kids: be yourselves and parents: be proud of your kids for who they are.      The movie is exciting and hilarious, with some great voice acting from the likes of Zach Braff (Scrubs), Don Knots, and a hilarious end-movie parody with Adam West.  Being a blu-ray movie (and on top of that, a DISNEY blu-ray movie), this picture quality is superb.  Every feather in Chicken Little's face is finely detaile.  Memorable scenes such as the baseball scene, where dozens of farm animal spectators line the seats around a grassy field stand out, as does the alien invasion at the end of the film.  Sound quality leaves a little to be desired - my 5.1 surround system wasn't used as well as in other animated movies such as Ratatouille.  Extras-wise: deleted scenes, making-of's, and commentaries are the order of the day.  You really can't complain.    Overall, this is an excellent movie that clocks in at a blazing fast 80 minutes.  No sitting through the time consuming adventures of Remy the Rat (no disrespect to Ratatouille, but it dragged in parts), and plenty of time for everyone in the family to sit an enjoy an old episode of Looney Toons...erm, Chicken Little with a deep message.  Oh, and the fish is the greatest animated character in recent memory.
B00007KQA3|5.0|As this movie is one of the most influential DVD's in Fiction. It would seem that that greed has won out over the (Commonsense) and sentient nature towards our fellow man. The everyday person would benefit greatly from viewing \\"1984\\" but it seems as if by coincidence that a movie produced less than four years ago would boast such an outrageous price. All sellers of this video would do their neighbor better justice by selling at more reasonable prices.  Before most of you are paid these prices. The reality of this story will either be true and/or you materials banned from sale.

1594489505|5.0|I loved the Kite Runner, its story is so original and fresh, so human and wonderful - one of the best stories I've ever read. I couldn't wait for the author's second book and finished it in one day. It is an excellent book. Different from the Kite Runner, but no less worthy of reading, this story is set entirely in Afghanistan and spans decades in the lives of two women and the country they live in.   For those not familiar with the culture, it is a great opportunity to learn; along with bringing to light all the differences, the author also shows that certain truths such as the power of love, parental and otherwise, and sacrifices of a mother, are universal. For the Afghan community, those who had to flee their country, the story might be a little difficult, that's how real it is. I recommend this book to everyone.....I just finished the Kite Runner this morning, for the second time. I wanted to read the two one after the other for fair comparison. But my advice is don't try to compare just read and enjoy, both are time very well spent in their own right. Enjoy!  For a good philosophical read I recommend [[ASIN:1434322580 Understanding: Train of Thought]].
B000002JSP|4.0|This is still one of my favorites, but then I do remember when it first came out, and I heard \\"In the Evening\\" for the first time...

Still all 4 original members, and still a great classic rock album from beginning to end.
B000X9Q8A4|1.0|I generally like tribute albums of this sort, and though this is technically not a tribute album I will lump it into that category. First of all, Bono of all people doesn't deserve to be singing Beatles music. His performances of Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds and I am the Walrus have a very sterile/pompous air about them. And I'm sorry, I doubt there is a human being alive that could do justice to the song Blackbird, other than Paul McCartney himself. The re-interpretations of these songs by the various performers are, in my opinion, definitely lacking with the exception of a few tracks, namely Joe Cocker's Come Together and Eddie Izzard on Mr. Kite. Most of these performers seem to have ignored or forgotten that the Beatles sang Rock & Roll. If I wanted to hear some downtempo Beatles music I would rather play one of their albums in reverse in search of some backmasking as opposed to listening to this drivel.
B000LXH0AE|4.0|Story line 1: A man hears his own actions narrated, generally after the fact. The narrating voice is always correct, but does it create or merely reflect the deed? Does the man have free will?    Story line 2: Man meets woman. Man falls for woman.     Story line 3: Narrator of man's life is growing increasingly distressed and disgusted with her own life. Can she do anything other than kill off her main characters? Does she have the freedom to do otherwise, even if she wanted to, or does that depend on the character himself?    All three of these story lines are woven at the same moment in time, contemporaneous and in sync with each other.     On the surface, this works as a nicely spun little fantasy. There are deeper elements though, if one chooses to look for them. Tragedy versus comedy in literature. The free will of a character. Isn't good literature always supposed to bestow free will upon its characters? Can the author of a piece of literature be influenced by his/her creation?     On the one level, this movie is charming and very enjoyable. The other levels can give us pause to think. Executed in a witty and subtly comedic manner. Very entertaining and well worth watching.
0060832819|5.0|When I first began reading \\"The Zahir\\", it was hard to experience the same sympathetic affinity with the main character that I felt with the protagonists in \\"Veronika Decides To Die\\" and \\"Eleven Minutes.\\" In this instance, it is a famous and affluent writer (Coelho himself?) who is arrested in the wake of his journalist wife's disappearance. When he realizes that she left voluntarily without any advance warning that he was capable of understanding at the time, his days and nights are spent obsessing about her. In trying to come to terms with her departure, he retraces her steps, seeks those who knew her as he never did (like her former lover Mikhail), and embarks on a mental and spiritual journey that forces him to process and conquer feelings of abandonment, anxiety, heartbreak, and alienation.<br /><br />According to the writer Jorge Luis Borges, the Zahir (which is Arabic for something that cannot go unnoticed) is a person, object, or idea that occupies our every thought until we can think of little else. According to Faubourg St-Peres, \\"This can be considered a state of either holiness or madness.\\" There's Scriptural precedent for such obsession: Luke 15:4 states, \\"What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?\\"<br /><br />\\"The Zahir\\", on the surface, is a novel about a man who, in trying to recapture a lost love, experiences a spiritual transformation. Taken in its entirety, it's also a gentle lesson in dealing with unexpected and bewildering loss. You can let it dominate your existance, or you can examine your role in the two-way tragedy and use your discoveries to fuel a happier life.
B000TGJ8CQ|5.0|NEXT held my attention all the way through.  First the premise was original and different.  A writer asks us to suspend belief and accept a premise,  once you do that, enjoy the ride.    I was with a friend in LA watching the Godzilla movie.  As Godzilla attacked NY, he questioned whether the suspension bridge could actually hold Godzilla's weight computing with engineering algorithms that it couldn't happen.  I explained he just spent $9 to see movie geniuses engineer a film adventure asking us to accept the premise that a fictional gigantic lizard exists and has run amuck in NYC.  Have fun.    NEXT is a what-if:  a mind was so advanced it could foresee a future and multiple paths to avoid the outcome.  Fascinating premise.  My accolades to the writer.      Whatever it is that Cage eats for breakfast, I have no idea, but he has mesmerizing screen personae and I know he's going to save the day, but it's always done with fresh ideas and great action.  I liked Julianne Moore in a competent strong unemotional female,                                                                                                                                                                  butch, kickin' butt role.     Don't like the movie?  Ummm...maybe you didn't get it, and couldn't let go.  It's a roller coaster ride for your mind.  Enjoy!
6304712944|5.0|When Camelot was produced in 1967, I was in the Army.  I first heard the title song when my room mate had it playing on his reel to reel tape player at Two Rock Ranch Station in Petaluma, California and was immediately smitten by the music.  I was discharged from the service in Oakland, California and returned to St. Louis, Missouri via Los Angeles where I was given a tour of the Warner Bros Seven Arts Studios in Burbank.  The throne room set was then in the process of being disassembled and I could tell that the artists who had created the wet rock wall effect which consumed an entire sound stage had been very good at their craft.  I had no idea what the signifigance of that visit was until I returned home to see the film at a local theater.  The music, the sets, the acting, the singing, and the story all come together to create and experience that you remember forever.  Franco Nero and Vanessa Redgrave did, in fact, fall in love during the production and had a son.  I also remember reading that a stunt man had been killed during the filming of the jousting scenes.  I guess I'm still old school for when I was able to buy this film on DVD, I felt that I was cheating the wonderful people who created it.  I was never a great fan of the musical, but this movie is truly in my top ten list of best films ever made.  Buy it.  You won't be disappointed.

B000PTYP5C|5.0|Dream Theater's latest entry brings musical and lyrical elements which have underlaid their earlier works more to the forefront.  These elements are darker in nature both from a musical standpoint (heavier and faster guitar and bass riffs and more intricate percussion tracks) and from a lyrical vantage where the songs tell stories of a darker nature.  For Dream Theater fans, it's DT at a new finest.  For newcomers to the DT scene it might be a bit too dark, still a fine CD.  I bought the set with the DVD and it is well worth any additional price as Mike Pornoy (DT drummer) made it and the various interviews and studio shots make for an informative and entertaining watch.
B000URDEB0|5.0|This is quite possibly the best album I have ever bought. The Mixture of metal and orchestra is perfect. Way Better then Metallica's S&M album. Annette Olzon's voice goes perfectly with this album. The Song \\"Bye Bye Beautifull\\" that I saw the video for on Headbangers Ball is what hooked me on to this album and band. Definatly note disapointed with my purchase.
0316743003|5.0|I have just found one of the best books that I have seen in a long time Skunk Works.    It was written by Ben Rich, the recent head of the Skunk Works facility - as in the U2, Blackbird, Stealth Planes.    It starts out about how the concept of a stealth plane got started (during the cold war), and how they were able to build it.    The theory of the technology came from a paper by Pyotr Ufimtsev, chief scientist at the Moscow Institute of Radio Engineering.   During the 1960s, he wrote about a concept that a Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell came up with back in 1831.  With today's small powerful computers, Stealth plane design was now possible.    A great book, and I found it very funny.  I was surprised to discover that the Skunk Works is an independent group of Lockheed, not controlled by either the CIA the government or Lockheed - of course that is where the money comes from, but that group comes up with their own money making projects that their very well paid engineers build.

Its bascially the same concept as the first ones, but with a few different problems and changed scenarios.  Its a bit entertaining, and fine if you have nothing better to do, but they are beginning to run the storyline into the ground.  If you're a fan of any of the superstars in this movie then it may be worth watching, but it has very little originality and got to be quite boring at times, we get it, thiefs-good, casinos-bad.

The album includes an acoustic version of the hit single \\"Tears in Heaven\\" and a heavily reworked acoustic version of \\"Layla\\". Clapton earned three Grammy Awards for the album: Album of the Year, Rock Male Vocal and Best Rock Song; besides another three for the record and song \\"Tears in Heaven\\".<br /><br />Clapton performed the show in front of a small audience on January 16, 1992 at Bray Film Studios in Windsor, England.<br /><br />In 2000 Q magazine placed Clapton's Unplugged at number 71 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever.\\"<br />The above from Wikipedia is interesting from a background point of view.  But it doesn't really touch on how great this CD is. I've had this CD for a while now and it is one of my favorites.  It is the CD that I always take to check out new equipment.  I am one of those idiots that is on the never ending quest for the best,(that I can afford) Stereo equipment.  This is a well recorded and excellently performed piece of music.  Mr. Clapton is at his best.  Layla and Tears are probably the best known songs, but every single song on the CD is a gem.  Not to many CD's that I own would I say that about.  If you don't have it buy it.  If you have it listen to it.  Truly great music.

0141439807|5.0|Miss Jane Austen (1775-1817) the spinster daughter of a Church of England clergyman wrote only six novels. Of that number \\"Mansfield Park\\" is not as well known as such hits as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\"; \\"Sense and Sensibility\\"; \\"Emma\\" \\"Persuasion\\" and Northanger Abbey.\\" It is, however one of Austen's finest works; a true class of English Regency fiction which will always live in the annals of great literature.<br />  Austen's novels all deal with courtship and social mores in small English villages among upper middle class folks. No one ever works! This novel has fascinating characters such as :<br />Fanny Price: The poor daughter of the feckless Mr and Mrs Price (nine children) who live in a chaotic household in the English seaport of Portsmouth. Fanny is farmed out at the age of 10 to Mrs. Price's wealthy sister Mrs.Thomas Bertram who is wed to Sir Thomas Bertram of Mansfield Park. Fanny is the gentlest, most taciturn, socially conservative and physically weakest of Austen's heroines. She is adept at listening and observing the actions of others in her social circle.<br />Mary and Henry Crawford: These two less than admirable siblings stay at their sister Mrs. Grant's home in the Mansfield parsonage. Mary flirts with Edmuind Bertram; Henry courts Maria Bertram but has his eyes on Fanny. They are both somewhat wild and Austen does not like them. These two bring the amorality of London's fast society to the small bucolic world of Mansfield with disaster ensuing.<br />Mrs. Norris-One of the most despicable, self-serving, greedy old harridan's in fiction. Mrs. Norris is the sister of Mrs Price and Betram. She coddles Maria and Julia Betram the spoiled daughters of Sir Thomas; she does not care for Fanny. Mrs. Norris could have come out of the pages of Dickens and is odious and unforgettable!<br />Tom Bertram is the oldest somewhat worthless son of the Bertrams.<br />Julia Bertram falls in love with Mr. Yates who was instrumental in organizing a play at Mansfield while Sir Thomas is away from home. Sir Thomas owns slaves in Antigua. Austen uses the play as a test of character. She disapproves of such frivolity and sees it as an intrusion into the orderly rural life of Mansfield. Fanny is the only character among the young people who opposes it's production.<br />  Austen is a subtle writer who uses such ordinary events as card parties, strolls in gardens and quiet conversation to reveal character to the reader. Unlike many great novelist she was a Christian woman who demanded high moral standards in her heroines and heroes. This novel ends well with wedding bells for the good and suitable misery for the evil characters.<br />  Austen is not everyone's cup of tea! Her novels are long and there is little overt action. It is true that you often have to skim back over an earlier section to remember who is speaking to whom! Her language is formal but she also relishes a good pun or turn of phrase.<br />Austen is working in a small area of the human story but in that baliwick of young love and romance she stands unsurpassed. Mansfield Park is a novel to savor. The introduction by Tony Tanner is a brilliant piece of literary commentary as he sees the novel as a clash between the order of Mansfield Park and the disorder of modern life exhibited in the disorderly household of Fanny's family in Portsmouth. Austen found virtue in country living; vice in the big city of London. She lived in an age of frivolity under George IV the Prince Regent (1811-182)so her call for moral behavior was a trumpet which needed blowing.Thomas is away from home.

1400079594|4.0|'Code of the Woosters' is frequently cited as P.G. Wodehouse's best entry in the Bertie and Jeeves series. It is a deliciously funny and clever little novel, revolving around the acquisition of an antique cow creamer. Bertie summarizes his pickle perfectly:<br /><br />\\"Right. Now then. Item One-Aunt Dahlia says that if I don't pinch that cow-creamer and hand it over to her, she will bar me from her table, and no more of Anatole's cooking.'<br />'Yes, sir.'<br />'We now come to Item Two-vis., if I do pinch the cow-creamer and hand it over to her, Spode will beat me to a jelly.'<br />'Yes, sir.'<br />'Furthermore-Item Three-if I do pinch it and hand it over to her and don't pinch it and hand it over to Harold Pinker, not only shall I undergo the jellying process alluded to above, but Stiffy will take that notebook of Gussie's and hand it over to Sir Watkyn Bassett. And you know and I know what the result of that would be. Well, there you are. That's the set-up. You've got it?<br />'Yes, sir. It is certainly a somewhat unfortunate state of affairs.\\" (106).<br /><br />Revealing much more of the humor involves revealing more of the plot, which I won't do. I will simply say that Wodehouse was one of the literary comic greats of his time. This novel is a good place to start.
B000BTGY1O|1.0|This movie was downright crapola. Why the hype, I have no idea. Bad plot, bad acting, over hyped piece of garbage.

B000N6TYLW|4.0|Gilmore Girls is the best TV series ever created! My single mom and I would sit down weekly and watch this show ever since it started and surprisingly I was the same age as Rory. It truly mirrored our relationship. I will miss it greatly! Season 7 was better than I expected after reading reviews of it, but the last 2 episodes were horrific. My mom and I both agreed that Rory should have married Logan, and that there should have definitely been more of a reunion between Loralei and Luke. Also, the ending should have been an episode with a look into the future so you know what really happens to the characters in the end! I pray that there is a movie made to wrap up these lose ends and even reunite Rory and Logan! Everyone should watch and own the whole series!

The only song I was a little dissapointed in wasTina Turners performance of The Game of Love. Michelle Branch is so much more suited for this song and does a much better job! All in all, excellent listening and entertainment!
B000YAF4OS|4.0|It's a funny thing about Stephen King--there's rarely any middle ground with his film adaptations. Either they're practically flawless (Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile) or they're downright embarrassing to watch (Maximum Overdrive, It). I'm happy to report that The Mist defied my many reservations and proved a solid 4 star movie with an ending that was nothing short of inspired.      For the most part it's your standard issue Kreepy-Krawlie Horror Show. A strange mist descends upon a sleepy rural town, a mist which conceals horrific monsters spawned in a hellish alternate reality. A small band of survivors, holed up in the local grocery store, must learn to work together to outwit these creatures and stay alive. Included in this group is a crazy Bible thumper, who seduces quite a few of these frightened people with her Apocalyptic visions of Divine Retribution and Judgment.  Naturally, mayhem and chaos ensue.        But what really sets this movie apart and makes it memorable is the ending. Somehow they managed to get this past the censors and give the audience an ending that is completely free of the usual Hollywood 'All Is Well!' schlock we've come to expect and loathe. There are no knights in shining armor who ride in to save the day. This is gritty and pointless and painfull to watch--just like real life. For those of you in the movie going public who demand a Feel-Good ending, no matter how cliche, improbable, and childishly simplistic, stay away from this film. I'm sure there's a new Lindsey Lohan stinker some Hollywood exec is preparing to spoon feed you even as you read this. But if you enjoy your movies a little less Disney-fied, you won't go far wrong with The Mist.Hopefully more directors will take notice and start respecting their audiences a bit more from here on in.
B000XPU5NY|4.0|Genesis have been my favorite band since 1983, so here goes-----<br />I have all 22 of the European concerts (limited edition-not bootlegs, Google it!!!)from this tour, and the song list was EXACTLY the same for all the shows, and this release as well. I also have many shows from all their tours, and this is probably the best song selection ever, taking into consideration the variety of material available. Sure, the Gabriel material is better, but it would be ridiculous to lean toward that material in 2007. The last thing I want to hear the band playing is Trespass material with Phil singing in 2007! At least the Phil-altered live lyrics to \\"Invisible Touch\\" and \\"I Can't Dance\\" are still there!!
0446577391|3.0|This is the third book in the Camel Club series by the writer and is an excellent, although harmless, read. It is strongly suggested that the reader read the Camel Club as well as The Collectors prior to reading this. An excellent job is done in defining the motivations of the characters for their actions in the first books of this series. Stone Cold, although an excellent read, does not do as well as a stand-alone book as did the first two entries in this series. The depth of characters, so readily apparent in books one and two, does not appear in this work. It is the fastest as far as action, with numerous double and triple twists existing, yet the slowest as far as intoducing the reader to the members of this group. It centers around the group leader as well as two \\"honorary\\" members of the Club in a rapidly paced and interesting story. The other Club members are somewhat ancillary and the writer does a credible job of handling different plot lines and drawing everythig together for the reader.

Just thinking about it brings me joy.

The relationship between Henry VIII and Katherine of Aragon had plenty of interesting facts that could have been portrayed but this goes in a totally different direction with numerous scenes not based on actual history.

I really liked this movie, and yes, I was one of those that applauded when one of the characters was killed.

B000VR824S|5.0|I was at this truly outstanding concert.  The DVD is great: wonderful sound quality and captures most of the magic of the concert.  Of course there are omissions and some of them were up to the artists themselves.  For whatever reason Jeff Beck's fabulous version of the Day in the Life was omitted.  This is likely not the producers responsibility but that of Jeff Beck.  At the previous Crossroads in 2004, none of his performance was included in the DVD becuase of his choice.  Beck may not want his performance included because of other marketing issues--e.g., future live CD/DVD.  A Day in the Life has been a standard in his live performances.

068987474X|1.0|This book just continues to show us how shallow men can be- but thankfully it isn't all men.  There are men out there who are able to tell the truth from the beginning and not tell women they will call when they won't.<br /><br />While he does hit the nail on the head about how women make excuses for men and keep hoping they will call or change or marry them, the thing is that men are not being congruent in the first place.<br /><br />How is it that they can run the business world but then the presence of women who they don't like leaves them lying and making up stories about why they can't call.<br /><br />Come on guys grow up and just tell us what you feel.  It is better to tell us to our faces rather than continue to show us how insecure you guys are having to cover up your feelings with lies. We are big girls and can handle it -after all we have to handle the weeks of living with the lies you tell up front.
0618680004|5.0|even if you disagree with it.  The prose is lucid and brilliant.  At the same time, Dawkins' mind works like most other \\"hard\\" scientists' in the sense that all concepts have to be put into their appropriate boxes and no fuzzy edges are permitted.  In his way of thinking, therefore, everything that is not true must be false.  For many of us, however, it is irrelevant whether God exists or not.  Religion is a source of community, ethics, inspiration, values, and is one of the most powerful impetuses to help others.  Dawkins never comes to grips with this way of viewing the issue, other than one throwaway line deep into the book.  Neither does he prove his case that religion has been more a source for evil than for good; because he believes that he has conclusively demonstrated the God concept to be \\"false\\" in an objective sense, he doesn't even seriously tackle this issue.  So read this book... but don't allow the brilliance of the prose to sweep away your critical faculties.

B000005JA8|3.0|One of the reviewers on here compared some of the music on 'Trout' to free-jazz saxophonist Ornette Coleman, and it's really apt. A lot of Coleman is dense, atonal blasts of horn that occasionally lapses into tight grooves and discernible melodies.    Beefheart replaces the sax with oddly-metered abstract-rock blasts, and the melody is replaced with a half-bluesman, half-circus announcer voice blaring captivating - but completely absurdist - lyrics. A lot of it can be grating, but there's a definite structure to most of it, even when it sounds totally out of joint. The dissonant groove at the beginning of \\"Ella Guru\\" is easy to bob your head to, as is the train-wreck stoner-rock of \\"Moonlight on Vermont.\\"     My personal favorite, however, has no music. \\"Orange Claw Hammer\\" is a sea-chanty-style poem featuring some of the wackiest imagery this side of Dylan's \\"Gates of Eden.\\"    To be sure, it's not for throwing on at a party, and it can certainly be tough to listen all the way through, but in bits and pieces, it's a crazy piece of art-rock history.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|You know a movie is great when shortly after walking out of it you keep re-telling the person you saw it with the funniest part. \\"Did you see when he did that...\\", \\"Oh, and didn't you just loved the way they showed....\\" etc...  This is a movie with so many favourite moments, I could not count them.  Also, what I loved is that while animated films often make creatures adorable who would normally been seen as gross, this movie shows you both sides and will make you cringe, too, which lends this movie also a charming spice of realism... while, of course, being mainly non realistic.  I loved it!

I aspire to live with half the courage and integrity she has displayed in her young life. I saw this book on someones desk at work and began reading while awaiting for my next assignment. The title caught my attention and the content is current and relevant. (Human rights, religion, racism, politics, social class, education, socialism etc.) I had to order my own copy.  Some of it is difficult to read; the pain, honesty and brutal experiences in Miss Ayaan Hirsi Ali's life and the price she is paying for her freedom. Freedom from other peoples expectations, freedom of speech, from living as a second class citizen in her native country. Freedom to become an educated and confident yet self effacing woman with endless compassion for the plight of millions of women caught in the severe restrictions of religion and culture.  Not the best literary work however the content makes up for it.  Highly recommend, insightful thought-provoking and not for wimps.  When I read this book in October, I Googled her and found she had just returned to Holland to continue with 24 hour body guard protection.
B000VI70X6|5.0|I'd been looking forward to this coming out for some time now and it did not disappoint!

Once I started reading Greg's deadpan descriptions of his life, I found myself laughing aloud -- really loud -- beginning with the first pages and continuing until I finished.      This is NOT simply a boys' book and it's NOT simply a graphic novel, though the wonderful drawings are absolutely key to the story.  Whether you're male or female, currently in middle school, or remembering for the first time in a long time how truly horrible it is, this book is F-U-N-N-Y!  I salute Jeff Kinney and wish him long-term success.

0765357151|4.0|It's amazing how things change in fifty years. In the fifties, what used to be considered science fiction is now science fact.<br /><br />Technology has grown in leaps and bounds, views on the world have changed for the better, and for the worse, we've learned so much.<br /><br />And, of course, even here in North America, our culture has changed as well. Quite dramatically.<br /><br />Personally, I don't know why I am Legend was written. Was it a social commentary? Or was it merely a work of fiction written to entertain and make (back then), the author a few bucks?<br /><br />However, the main reason I chose to read this classic novel was based entirely on the movie of the same name starring Will Smith coming out on December 14th.<br /><br />Reading the novel was quick and easy. Actually, the novel was only a hundred and sixty pages out of 312 pages. The rest of the novel is a collection of short stories, ranging in length from a couple of pages, to forty or fifty pages.<br /><br />Some of the short stories were frightening, some humorous, some outright confusing.<br /><br />But the main novella in this publication was, of course, I am Legend.<br /><br />It's the story of the last man on Earth. Robert Neville is the only survivor of a plague that either killed, or turned the rest of humanity into vampires. Some of these vampires are living, some are dead. It does get a little confusing at times.<br /><br />It chronicles his life over a period of years, starting a few months after the end of humanity.<br /><br />The novella, at times, was hard to read. Richard Matheson was able to bring across, through the medium of word, the hopelessness, despair and loneliness the last human on Earth felt.<br /><br />Especially because he had to deal with the nightly siege of his refuge by the vampire hoards.<br /><br />In a way, it chronicles the death of one species, while witnessing the birth of another.<br /><br />On a side-note, the novella really showed its age. Even though it was supposedly set in 1976, it was originally written in 1954.<br /><br />Back then, nearly 54 years ago, married men and women still slept in separate beds (it's a wonder how any pregnancies occurred), women still wore dresses, and the men were the main breadwinners.<br />And blacks were called something else. Not the derogatory term, the racist term, but still, a term that has long since fallen out of use in our society.<br /><br />So, from a society point of view, it is quite interesting to read it in modern times, to see how things were portrayed in the time of most of our parents or grandparents.<br /><br />For those of you who don't know, this will be the third film adaptation of the novel. The first was The Last Man on Earth, Starring Vincent Price, released in 1964. A few years later in 1971 it was shot as The Omega Man, which starred Charlton Heston.<br /><br />I personally have never seen the Vincent Price version, but if I get a chance, I will try to remedy that. Although I have seen The Omega Man and found it entertaining.<br /><br />From what I remember of the Omega Man, the novella and the movie have very little in common. If memory serves, the character portrayed by Heston was a researcher working for the military, who survives the plague that kills off most of humanity by injecting himself with the only known cure for it. There are those who did survive this plague however, and it turned these survivors into robe wearing, technology hating albinos, who want to kill him because he's the last `pure' human.<br /><br />As I said, very little in common with the novella.<br /><br />I do recommend the novella to read, even though it does show it's age, albeit gracefully.

B000HBKCDC|5.0|I love, loVE, LOVE this entire album.  It is for the melancholy of heart during the holidays, but that's OK.  I think that I like her remakes as well as the original renditions.  Yes, I like Happy XMas (War is Over) as well as John Lennon's & River as well as Joni Mitchell's.  Wintersong (not a remake) is quite lovely also.  And, of course, Christmastime Is Here (Vince Guaraldi) is one of my all-time favorites.  I dig the slow, mellow, almost somber acoustic arrangements throughout.  It is such a welcome change from the classics.  I don't foresee tiring of this album.  I am enjoying Sarah more & more as her voice matures over the years.
1582701709|5.0|I think all too often we forget that we have an incredible power within us.  We just have to tap into that power.  Too often we seek \\"external\\" help; when the help we need can be found from within.  We all possess an inner strength.  And it is a great blessing to be able to find ways to use that inner strength.       I truly believe we can receive blessings from above.  But I think that before God  blesses us, he wants us to rely upon our God-given inner strength.    I am so glad that The Secret was written.  Because now The Secret is no longer a secret!  And I think many lives have been changed for the better because of this book.      Also recommended:  [[ASIN:0757300537 Christmas Gifts, Christmas Voices]]--another life changing book!

0439882826|5.0|I got this pop up for my grandkids who are huge fans. This book does not disapoint. I was impressed with how many pop ups were on each page and how intricate each was. This book covers all the characters of the Star Wars features and the last page is really a stunner! I won't say what it is. You just need to get a book and find out for yourself.
B000002LBH|5.0|Spanning the Smiths' entire career, Louder Than Bombs is an enormous collection of non-LP singles (every single one that didn't appear on a U.S. album, as a matter of fact), b-sides, rarities, alternate mixes, and other odds and ends. However, don't think of this as a simple scraped together cash-in: The Smiths were simply too good for that kind of thing. Indeed, the best of these songs are every bit as good as the highlights of the group's proper albums. There's the chiming, propulsive \\"Is It Really So Strange,\\" with its towering melody and lyrics that are by turns funny, beguiling, and vulnerable (and since this is Morrissey we're talking about, it goes without saying that they're stunningly poetic). \\"Half A Person\\" is a moody masterpiece with ponderous acoustic guitars chiming beneath brittle vocals. There's the hypnotic sensuality of \\"Stretch Out And Wait,\\" and the quintessentially Smiths-ian catharsis of \\"These Things Take Time.\\" You also get the haunting plea of \\"Back To The Old House\\" and the brief desolation of \\"Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want.\\" Also included is the cavernous Brit-punk surge of \\"London\\" and the sneering \\"You Just Haven't Earned It Yet, Baby.\\" \\"Sweet And Tender Hooligan\\" is bitterly funny social commentary, and \\"Girl Afraid\\" plays like witheringly smart daytime drama, with a shimmering guitar line thrown in to boot.  There's a snazzy piano driven instrumental called \\"Oscillate Wildly,\\" and paean to immortality by the name of \\"Rubber Ring.\\" \\"This Night Has Opened My Eyes\\" is a tense, smokey classic that shows off Morrissey's penchant for storytelling. We've also got an alternate mix of the classic \\"Hand In Glove.\\" It's not particularly different from the original, but hey, it's another excuse to listen to \\"Hand In Glove.\\" The seven non LP singles are all fantastic as well- The anthemic \\"Sheila Take A Bow,\\" the shuffling chime of \\"Ask,\\" the harrowing \\"Panic,\\" the storming post-punk breakdown \\"Shakespeare's Sister,\\" the cheerfully glum \\"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now,\\" the twisted imagery and cavernous production of \\"William, It Was Really Nothing,\\" the tension of \\"Shoplifters Of The World Unite,\\" well- it's all just fantastic. Get it.

B000056VJ7|5.0|As unlikely a success as the emergence of The Clash and The Ramones in 1977/78 was the explosive success of one Meat Loaf. Salvaged from the scraps of Jim Steinman's rock and roll opera of \\"Peter Pan/Neverland,\\" these Wagnerian blasts of bombast stealthily kept insinuating their way into the national consciousness until \\"Bat Out Of Hell\\" sold over 13 million copies and made Meat Loaf and Steinman very rich men.<br /><br />But why is that? These songs are pretentious overblown howlers, subtle as flying skillets and louder than the motorcycle that revs in the title track. Frankly, in 1978, this was the fantasy of what a rock album should sound like. Loud and overwhelming, sonics that filled a room, and testosterone by the bucketful. Producer Todd Rundgren 100% got what Meat and Steinman were aiming for, and filled the album with a theatricity rare in music at that time. It makes such balladry like \\"Heaven Can Wait\\" or the mammoth \\"Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad\\" so over the top that both men and women could deal with it, then slams home the frat-party classic \\"Paradise By The Dashboard Light.\\"<br /><br />Lest anyone forget just how far-afield this was at the time, Meat and Steinman had just about every label in the country pass this up multiple times as being too noncommercial. It took a tiny label, Cleveland International, and a grass-roots swell of popularity before the album detonated. It was Meat Loaf's blessing and curse, as it took him almost 20 years and a clone album ([[ASIN:B000002OMN Bat out of Hell II: Back into Hell]]) before his popularity rebounded. But these songs still resonate with all the melodrama that they did on their first listens almost 30 years ago. Detractors may say as they want, but \\"Bat Out Of Hell\\" is a defining moment in rock/pop history.<br /><br />Minuses - the two live tracks sound great, but by now, Meat Loaf's voice is showing the damage that caused him to delay the follow-up [[ASIN:B0000025GD Dead Ringer]] and led Steinman to issue [[ASIN:B0000025IQ Bad for Good]]. More proof that extra cuts don't always constitute \\"bonus.\\" Bands sounds amazing, but you get to hear Meat unable to hit any high notes or hold any longer ones.ood]].

0743297334|5.0|This is a response to some of the other reviews. You have to remember that there are such things as symbolism and metaphor in literature. Also, there is historical context to keep in mind when reading this novel. People who find this book boring are taking it at face value. Example, the bull fighting is not there just for entertainment, it is also a metaphor.

B0002TT0NW|4.0|After a start of pathetically bad proportions, HP is back, and they actually did a good job this time. After Chris Columbus was gone (thank God) the HP franchise got Alfonso Cauron. Alfonso got it right. The sets were great, the screenplay was awesome, the directing fantastic, the acting, very good. While this movie is not perfect, it still amounts to a recommended film on my list. The film has a much darker tone than the last two, this tone helps the film alot, it's much more easy to take seriously. John Williams cooks up his best score of the series, making it moodie, creepie, happy, and at points terrifying, the best of this score is probably the children's choir singing \\"Double Trouble\\".    I highly recommend this film, for me, it is currently (December '07) the second best film of the franchise.
B000WAGVHE|5.0|the blu-ray version was gorgeous.  the story was wonderful and made me feel good to be alive.  a very up lifting story.  even the special features are good.  worth every penny.
B000AL730O|4.0|This is one great album. I remember the huge buildup and all the praise it got when it came up, and I agree with it. Mostly, anyway: Macca still can't help being a bit silly (\\"English Tea\\"), some of the ballads are rather sluggish (\\"At the Mercy\\"; \\"This Never Happened Before\\"), and the lyrics aren't too meaningful (\\"Friends to Go\\"; \\"Follow Me\\"). Furthermore, as my amazon friend Ol' 'nuff 'n Den Sum says, it needs a bit of rock. However I do like most of it: the atmospheric philosophy \\"Riding to Vanity Fair\\"; quiet acoustic songs \\"Jenny Wren\\"; \\"How Kind of You\\", \\"Too Much Rain\\" and \\"Promise to You Girl\\", some near-rockers \\"Fine Line\\" and \\"Anyway\\". I also feel this ridiculous urge to mock the Latin-jazz hybrid \\"A Certain Softness\\", but I like it too - sixty-five years old and he's still doing interesting things. Not as creative or experimental as Red Rose, Band on the Run, or those Beatles classics, and it's a few burritos short of a full Taco Bell (which in this case means \\"just short of being a truly great album\\", not \\"insane\\"). One thing it is, though, is a highlight of Macca's long career
1932907009|5.0|Read this, re-read this, go to a seminar if you can.     This book has helped me immensely in terms of gaining clarity, focus, and a much more compelling and entertaining story. Many of us start the writing process with a character, a scene (that we get attached to), and then try and string it together with some rambling story. This book with help you avoid that trap.    Both movies goers and producers make many of their decisions based on a one or two line summary of a project. STC shows you how to develop a killer logline (one line summary). If you do this and cannot get anyone interested in your idea, why would you continue to write until you can make it interesting?  If you have a weak logline, believe me, the screenplay will not get better as you expand from one sentence to one hundred pages! STC gives great guidelines and a beat sheet to help avoid this. However, it is still your responsibility to come up with that great idea.     This is one of the best, most user friendly books in the genre that I have read. His second book is highly recommended also.
B000R4SMCW|4.0|Since I am both a lover of psychological thrillers and a fan of Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling, it would be nearly impossible for me not to like this film, Fracture. And I was not disappointed. Though I would agree with some of the reviewers that Ryan's character Willy Beachum was not particularly likeable at first, I would disagree that he was as bad as Anthony's character, Ted Crawford. After all, Willy is cocky and ambitious, Ted is arrogant AND a cold-blooded killer. Willy though flippant, and perhaps a little arrogant, hardly comes off as someone who would shoot their wife point-blank in the face.     Ted's machinations occur from the beginning. In the very first scene, he tells his wife, \\"I love you,\\" and in the next minute shoots her in the face. And every step he takes after that is carefully designed to outwit everyone from the cops to the prosecutor to even the judge. It's this maneuvering by Ted that makes the film worth seeing. Everybody knows he did it -- but is he that smart, that conniving that he will get away with the perfect murder?    That's where Willy comes in. From the beginning, he underestimates Ted. Pre-occupied with starting a new, lucrative job, Willy thinks he has an open and shut case and gives it very little attention. In fact, when he first visits the crime scene with the police, he is on the phone with his soon-to-be employer trying to decide how he wants his new office decorated. Well, he gets totally humiliated at the trial by Ted and things go downhill from there.     The movie, though not heart-pounding, keeps your interest. Noteworthy performances are given by the rest of the cast. David Strathairn plays Willy's boss, the hard-boiled, but with soft edges, head of the district attorney office. Embeth Davidtz' talent is wasted as the wife, as she is comatose for most of the movie. Rosamund Pike plays a ruthless lawyer and Willy's brief love interest. Pike actually is more dislikeable than Willy as she embodies all the things we hate about lawyers. In one scene she chastises Willy that it's not about convicting a killer, but it's more important that you \\"can do as you're told.\\"     The most unbelievable character I think was the police officer (Billy Burke) who had an affair with Ted's wife which precipitates the whole chain of events. He comes off as a lovesick dolt. What cop would have an affair with a woman and not know her real name? He, more than anyone,  has the resources to find out someone's identity. But for the plot to work, perhaps him not knowing her name is essential and I guess we can forgive the movie this test of our common sense.    The movie has good character development -- at least for Willy. He goes from a flippant, all-about-me persona to someone who actually cares about the victim and bringing her assaulter to justice. The plot may be somewhat predictable, but the main method Ted uses to get away with the crime was a surprise to me. The dialogue is good, especially Ted whose every word is calculating and clever. Throughout the movie, he taunts everyone with his superior cleverness but eventually forgets his own earlier message to Willy.     The title \\"Fracture\\" is the movie's subtle message. Early on, Ted makes a comment that, \\"If you look closely enough, you'll find that everything has a weak spot where it can break.\\" And that's what Ted is good at throughout the movie, finding people's weak spot and using it to his advantage. But what Ted doesn't seem to comprehend, is that he too has a weak spot and it will be his undoing, his fatal flaw.
B000RG1FMO|4.0|Great cd i have 2 admit i never been much of a Kanye West fan at all but if it wasn't for my boy telling i should pick this album up i never would have but im glad that i did because this album was a big surprise to me.  The tracks the i like the best are \\"Everything I Am\\" & \\"The Glory\\" nice beats and nice flow.  I have 2 admit i really like this album and i recommended it to all my boys and they all went and got it and not one of them were dissappointed.  The album is a must in any cd collection
0061142026|4.0|I read the book after watching the movie, and I have to admit I was a little disappointed. The movie is appropriate for young audiences, more of a family entertainment sort of thing, but I LIKED that. It was more pretty colors and sparkles. The book reminded me more of the old, orginal Grimm tales: dark and deadly. As far as basics go, most of the characters are pretty much the same, and it's mostly the same story. But the tone is very different, and the book's ending was less satisfying for a Disney-lover like myself.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|What else can be said about GARTH BROOKS that hasn't been said at least a zillion times before.  He's the MAN!!!!  Partial?  You bet.  Great music?  Absolutely.  Buy it??  OF COURSE  This set also includes a DVD which is beyond awesome.
B000VNMMQ6|5.0|The blu-ray version of Die Hard 4 is everything you'd want for your home theater: great visuals, great sound, bombastic as all getout.  The image is crisp and clear.  The plot definitely mirrors modern times and juxtaposes John MacLean nicely against more modern threats.  The extra features are interesting.  I particularly enjoyed the Guyz Nite video (hilarious).  I loved this movie in theaters and now I love it on my PS3.
B000W4KT6E|3.0|\\"Hairspray\\" is a good-natured, quirky musical adapted from the 2002 Tony Award-winning musical, which was in turn adapted from John Water's 1988 cult film. In Baltimore 1962, Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky) is a cheerful, plump high school student who is crazy about dancing. She and best friend Penny (Amanda Bynes) catch the Corny Collins teen dance show on television every day after school. Some new dance moves that Tracy picks up from the hip black students in detention give her a shot at a spot on the Corny Collins Show and an impetus to advance the cause of racial integration. The result is a strange and amusing take on social change and racial strife in the 1960s.<br /><br />Nikki Blonsky was herself a high school senior when she was cast to play Tracy Turnblad. It's nice when young characters are played by young actors, as opposed to 25-year-olds. This film retains the tradition, begun by John Waters, of having a man in drag play Tracy's plus-sized mother Edna. This time it's a straight man in a fat suit. John Travolta's Edna is endearing but could have used more sass. Michelle Pfeiffer spews venom as the racist, unscrupulous television station manager Velma von Tussle and seems to have fun with the character. Christopher Walken is sweet and oddly charming as Tracy's sympathetic father. \\"Hairspray\\" is pleasant and eccentric but lacks energy and edge that would have made it truly enjoyable.<br /><br />The DVD (New Line 2007 single disc): No real bonus features on the single disc edition. There is a DVD-ROM for Windows only. And there is a list of songs and artists featured on the soundtrack. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish.

0340765585|5.0|I have read King books over the years, some but not all, and frankly, I had stopped reading them. SPOILER ALERT (according to someone who read this, but I'm not giving away the ending as far as I'm concerned, but be forewarned I guess)!!!!!!  My complaint was that there was always a totally unnecessary ugly event happening to a child, usually a death, that when you finished the book, you say, was that really important to the story? Like the girl dieing in \\"Langoliers\\", or the boy shooting himself in \\"Needful Things\\", the murdered twin girls in \\"Shining\\", the kid in \\"Cujo\\". I am not afraid of these elements, but they need to be important, and finding them not important, I got turned off. Well, here comes a book that features one main character, a kid, and I'm thinking, this is a disaster in the making (for me). I didn't read it for several years, it sat on a bookshelf (I gave it to my daughter as a gift, she was really into King novels for awhile). Well, I picked it up in a hurry the other day for a weekend plane trip, and read it, and I am blown away. It was not predictable, and it was simply, very moving. Very moving. I don't want to give away any of the story elements, because I do recommend it. If you're not moved at the end of this story, then your emotion switch is not functioning!
B000002BHE|5.0|This is my favorite Celine Dion cd with great songs from a woman with an amazing voice, my favorite song is \\"I Don't Know\\"
B000E8N690|5.0|An accurate movie about \\"The Man In Black\\". Great sound track, great acting, great story! A candid and realistic excursion into the highs and lows of a true country music legend. The acting and character development is so genuine it could be a documentary. It's a video that you'll watch multiple times, and is worth owning just for the music alone.

B0002SVW3O|4.0|If I remember correctly, this album was supposed to be experimental, not something concerning a particular concept or following a certain pattern.  Many fans don't consider this album their favorite.  But it was my first, and I can't deny that this one may be my most liked.      The vocalist reminds me of ghosts singing to themselves in their (after)lifetime of bleakness.  The delicately soft music hypnotizes me.  Though Von is primarily supposed to be experimental, I believe this album flows very easily.  Nothing virtuoso, as Sigur Rós's music has always reflected, but this album's atmosphere is beautifully introverted and contemplative.  It is very dark despite the title's suggestion.  The child's picture on the album cover even hints at the music's subtle eerieness.      The subject seems to hint at the perception of the birthing process and the introduction of life's abstracts through a very young child's eyes.  The album's air is disturbing, passive-aggressive, and, in some songs, at a euphoric calm.    The tracks that stand out, in my humble opinion, are:    2. Dögun - Very long but very intriguing.  The guitar adds a nice twist to the song's creepy atmosphere.    3. Hún Jörð - A \\"reversed\\" Lord's prayer to Mother Earth.  Definitely one of the most chaotic songs of Sigur Rós.  Jonsi screams, and then he screams backwards.  Odd but distinct in comparison to the band's future sound.    5. Myrkur - An eerily active yet sorrowful piece about darkness.  The drums add a rhythm to Sigur Rós that I have not found on any other albums.  The same even goes for the guitar section.    7. Hafssól - I would say this song is a precursor to the future of Sigur Rós.  It is slow and mellow, and it reminds me of space or the sea more than a half-sun.    9. Von - This song almost tells me \\"finally,\\" as if it settles all of the tension built up previously.  The acoustic guitar and quiet drumming adds an earthy tone to this settled piece.    11. Syndir Guðs (Opinberun Frelsarans) - Tense, sad.  I think I hear whispers of English, such as \\"Nobody here,\\" in the background.  That sums it up fairly well.    Basically, I can appreciate all of the songs on here that are not fillers.  But even the fillers are enjoyable, if not at times twisted, transitions.    This album is underrated but worth your time if you are interested in Sigur Rós.
B00005JPLW|1.0|Gladiator had a good story, acting, directing and was well made. Russel Crow may not be a nice guy in person but he is one hell of a actor. What i don't get is why do all the 300 spartans look like rejects from the WWE. They don't have not one hair on there body this story takes place thousands of years ago where did they get those completly wax bodies. The Persian king is so gay looking Liberace would say that he is way to flamboyant. Speaking of the WWE why is it that all the Spartan's shout there dialog i was half expecting Randy 'The macho man' Salvage to come out at any minute. The main reason i think this movie sucks is the director i never heard of the dude who directed this. If they were to be more acurate with the true story hire better actors, a better script and director who has alot of experience with doing action movies. This movie reminds me of those ones that MST3K make fun of but those have a reason they are bad they have no budget. They should bring that show back to TV but instead of poking fun of no budget movies they should make fun of crappy hollywood blockbusters like this.

I am very easy to please and for this,it has...Go get this double performance. It Will Rock You!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0743298039|5.0|To me, finding a new author whose works I enjoy can be a bit of a challenge.  I am very particular about my reading material, requiring characters about whom I can care, a story that is always compelling, and language that keeps my interest.  I find that I frequently turn to Amazon's recommendations, and once in a while, they pass me a gem.  Such was the case with The Thirteenth Tale.<br /><br />As other reviewers have commented, this is a Gothic thriller, in the vein of Wuthering Heights and its ilk.  While not a genre I generally enjoy, The Thirteenth Tale contained such exquisitely drawn characters and stimulating plot that I could not put it down.  My only disappointment was that the story ended.  I wanted to read more of this expertly crafted work.<br /><br />If you have a couple of days to devote to a good read, by all means, grab this book.  But if you do not, be prepared to stay up all night or be tempted to call in sick to work, as this book will not easily be ignored in favor of real world responsibilities.  The synapsis states that this book is for \\"the feral reader in all of us.\\"  I would go one further and recommend it for all rabid readers, as it is positively maddening in its obsessive plot.  Enjoy!
0380713802|4.0|I read this book shortly after my study abroad trip to Rome. I found Bryson to be very humorous and laughed out loud numerous times. I enjoyed the book while i read it in about 3 days flat.    My only issues when getting further along was when he obviously began to be homesick. He would pick on each location and pick apart what problems they had and complain about it. After a while he just became cranky and made you almost want to quit reading the book. He rushed through his trip near the end and it was sloppy.    Although a good amount of what he said still applies today, but this book is out of date to read about current Europe. He took this trip back in 1990. It's been 17 years and I would not use this book to accurately give a feel for each city visited.    I still more or less enjoyed the book and would read just to refresh myself on my own memories of Europe and to have a good chuckle.
071563318X|1.0|As a fan of zombie movies, I could not believe how badly Max Brooks botched the chance to write a funny book.  This book is dry, dull, and drones endlessly on about boring details when it could have been the next Shawn of the Dead.  Worse, as other reviewers have made clear, it doesn't even succeed as a serious book - the basic facts are poorly researched and sometimes self-contradictory, and it certainly isn't scary.    Writing a book with this title is a golden opportunity to be hilariously tongue-in-cheek.  Either Max Brooks decided to operate under the delusion that zombies are a real threat that requires actual preparation, or his tongue was so deeply embedded in his cheek that his laugh lines are completely indecipherable.    If you are attacked by a zombie, give him this book to read.  It will bore him to death.
0307346609|5.0|I checked out The Zombie Survival Guide from the library and when I heard this was out I had to have it.<br />It was an amazing insight on the different views and events that occur before, during, and after a zombie apocalypse. It was an easy read since it was broken up into short tellings.<br />I'd love to see a book that expands on some of the recountings of WWZ.<br />Either way... highly recommended for anyone who digs zombies.
B000VWYNNW|2.0|Kudos to Led Zeppelin for finally getting it together to re-visit this, the only live album released by the band during their active years.  The sound is good overall...    BUT    This is a grade-F hack job so far as editing is concerned.  \\"No Quarter\\" is missing HUGE chunks of Jimmy Page's climactic guitar solo, losing a lot of the epic punch.  The edit itself is incredibly jarring - even the non-fanatical listener will recognize the bad edit.  Secondly, John Bonham's solo track, \\"Moby Dick\\", is similarly chopped and edited.  To make matters worse, Kevin Shirley decided to add a bunch of swirling flange and phase effects to the solo that were not present at neither the actual concerts, the original movie, nor the original soundtrack album.  \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" is chopped into oblivion as well, with cuts so noticeable only the deaf would miss them.  Moreover, many of Robert Plant's vocal \\"scats\\" which were on the original issue are mysteriously absent here.  Finally, and I'm getting nerdy here, but \\"The Ocean\\" is out of sequence on the CD.  It should have been last as this was an encore track in 1973.    This CD set is a HUGE missed opportunity.  Zeppelin COULD have released a sprawling 3-cd set with complete versions of all the songs played at Madison Square Garden in sequence without crazy edits.  Unfortunately, this didn't happen.  Even with the inclusion of \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\", \\"The Ocean\\" and \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\", you could do a LOT better by taking your old cd's and adding the new tracks to them.  I'm very sorry to say that my copy of this once-classic was promptly returned.    Stick with the original issues of both \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" movie and its soundtrack, if you can find them.  They are much better representations of the live behemoth that was Led Zeppelin than this flop.
B0009Q0F5U|5.0|All of the BSG soundtrack/scores are just incredible. They are one of the many reasons this show is top notch.<br />Bear McCreary is an amazingly talented individual and I look forward to listening to his works for a long time.
B000TGCR38|5.0|I'd rather just say I watched this movie twice on back to back nights as I found it quite entertaining. The sub-titles didn't distract from the plot and the set up didn't spoil the plot. You can read any review and they might spoil the story, right ? But rather than story, which is superb, its the pacing and characters that grab you and make you at times love and hate them. It's got two gristly sequences which in my mind didn't have to be so in your face. But beyond that its a story of survival and one that even when you know the answer might take you on other roads to complete the screenplays idea's. Just go see it, BEST film I've seen all year, thats BOTH times I watched it. In fact I could watch it again and enjoy the acting and the whole Mcguffin as Hitch would have said ;)
B000BW7QWW|5.0|If you want an amazingly timeless movie, this is it. While you don't have to watch the series to understand the basics of the movie I would highly recommend it. You'd be cheating yourself out of so much more if you didn't.<br />Take the time to watch the series, then watch this movie... over and over again.
073933235X|4.0|I found this series pretty informative on what goes on behind the scenes in a kitchen.  It kinda tells you what to expect when you become a chef.  Although I'm not sure every kitchen is this vulgar and corrupt it definately       opens your eyes.  I would recommend to anyone thinking about going to culinary school or who is aspiring to become a chef
B00092ZMDY|4.0|I am not a great rock fan, but \\"Lyin' eyes\\" is one of my all-time favourites. I only realised that this DVD existed when I saw the \\"Lyin' eyes\\" clip on YouTube, and so I bought it. OK, as in all popular acts, the songs are of varying quality, ranging from pretty ordinary to outstanding. What really did impress me was the sheer professionalism shown, how they did their best to make a good sound on stage for the fans and deliver value for what was probably a lot of money. The voices are past their best now (Don Henley sounding somewhat strained in \\"Desperado\\", although this did add poignancy to the words), but they were still remarkably good after all these years. It was also interesting seeing so many young folk, who couldn't have been born when the Eagles started, but all singing along with the words. Recommended.
0740748475|5.0|This gets 5 stars because Bill Watterson delivered, for more than a decade (11/18/85 to 12/30/95) - on a daily basis, five-star material through his creation of Calvin & Hobbes. And the many years are all here in these three weighty volumes, housed in a sturdy box - you'd never guess it was bound in China unless you checked the back of the title page. But I was living in Asia during the mature years of Calvin & Hobbes, and it was a daily treat, in the Judeo-Christian fashion, to meet those two every morning in the Daily Yomiuri. To this day that English version of the world's largest-circulation daily newspaper still prints Calvin & Hobbes, most probably with an eye on its bread & butter: circulation!     I could go into the philosophical insights that Watterson purveyed, starting with his choice of epithets. Alas, this is a review on a sturdy, well-bound collection, and not on Watterson's genius and sense of fun. I only wish I had maintained a personal diary so I could recall what I was doing on the days each Calvin & Hobbes strip appeared, but maybe Calvin was having a more interesting time than my own \\"anonymous, boring life\\"! Read Bill Watterson's introduction: he's as good in prose as he is on the strip.
B000P12LWY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this  historical drama.  It may not be exactly accurate from a historian's perspective, but it gives a good feel for the era.  Jonathan Rhys Myers is excellent as Henry as is Sam Neill as Wolsely.  Each episode is fast paced.  I saw every episode when it aired on TV and will definitely purchase the DVD.  This one's a keeper!!
B000QQH4YS|5.0|Absolutely brilliant addition to any collection - I already had the Region 2 version but glad I bought this. Completely uncut, ie. Murphy's death and the editied \\"normal version\\". Tons of special features on the 2nd disc aswell as really insightful commentries. Cool tin packaging aswell! A must for any serious collector.
B000X9PNOG|5.0|But the US release is significantly worse than the UK release. I say this because the UK release comes with a bonus disc with the movie \\"in search of paradise\\" which is an excellent movie. However people from the US can't see it unless they buy the UK release and get a multi-regional DVD player. But the concert itself was INCREDIBLE. Meat Loaf sounds so much better than he does on many different youtube videos that I've seen, and he is for the most part, in tune. Sometimes he's a little off, but most singers are. The performance of I'd Do Anything for Love is the best I've ever seen. Better than Melbourne or any other performance he's done. I do wish In the Land of the Pigs was played, but I got to see him perform it so I'm not upset. I'd suggest getting this CD. I have a feeling that In Search of Paradise is coming out in theaters in the US which is maybe why it wasn't released on this DVD.
B00007FOMP|3.0|Marvin Gaye's \\"What's Going On\\" has been consistently acclaimed as one of the best albums of all time since it came out in 1971, and is often seen as the moment black music liberated itself from the confines of mass production.<br /><br />For all the efforts Gaye might have made to deal with the opposition of his record company to focusing as he did on social issues, the music on \\"What's Going On\\" really does not live up to its reputation. Unlike [[ASIN:B00004S367 Stevie Wonder]], [[ASIN:B000002ARX Sly Stone]] or later [[ASIN:B000001FCM Parliament]], \\"What's Going On\\" is distinctly lightweight, even flyweight in tone. At times, indeed, Gaye's voice sounds even soppy and devoid of any emotion, notably on the famous title track.<br /><br />Only twice, on the two lesser-known tracks \\"Flying High (In The Friendly Sky)\\" and \\"Right On\\", is their really any passion and emotion. Whilst all of \\"What's Going On\\" is heavily orchestrated, only there does the orchestration enhance rather than blunt the groove in the music, so that in general \\"What's Going On\\" is one of many failed attempts from that period at orchestration in pop music. \\"Flying High (In The Friendly Sky)\\" is so toughing as to obscure the lightweight character of the music, whilst the epic groove of \\"Right On\\" is the one emotional note here. Even \\"Mercy Mercy Me\\", which is promising, could catch fire far better than it does.<br /><br />Compared to the best soul music of its day, \\"What's Going On\\" is really disappointing. Stick with [[ASIN:B00004S367 Music of My Mind]] or [[ASIN:B000001FCM Mothership Connection]] to see the best of blakc music from that tense era.
B000MXPE7O|4.0|If there ever was a worn out spy, Matt Damon is definitely the one in his fine portrayal of Edward Wilson, CIA agent from priviledged family and Yale education.  I have not seen a character like this since John Le Carre's agent Smiley.  Edward is a quiet man, who keeps his emotions and feelings to himself. He is also damaged, since as a child, he witnessed his father's suicide.  The emotional void of having a father figure in his life, pushes him towards seemingly caring man such as his mentor at the university and eventually towards career in CIA.  Edward is pushed into a marriage to a woman (played by Angelina Jolie) he barely knows and the marriage is doomed from the start.  Their son, the bond that keeps the marriage together is also a reminder to both of them of their poor match.  As we trace Edward's career thru some of the important events of the cold war, we learn about him as a father, husband, lover and the unscrupulous secret agent.  It is difficult to imagine that sensitive young man, interested in poetry and above all loyal to the people close to him would resort to the dread of a life of a spymaster full of secrets and lies.  But then, as the film reaches its conclusion we almost get to think of him as a an on the suicide mission of his own.  He is not looking into pulling the trigger on himself, but he is walking on the tight rope, close to falling at any time.  Then again, he is so worn out and alone, that after al, he has very little to lose in this game.  Directed by Robert DeNiro with wonderful cast of actors.
0143038419|1.0|Catchy title, but what a crapfest...err...huge disappointment. The author is selfish and shallow. Did I mention shallow? This woman feels sorry for herself. Her solution is to take trips around the world and meet with spiritual gurus? Gaaack! I read that she got an advance on the book prior to all the trips. I do not know if that is true. But I tend to believe it.     There is nothing Christian about this book. I usually pass my books on to other people. Not this one. It's going in the trash. If you absolutley must read it, check it out from the library.
1594489505|5.0|This book opens the eyes of the West to things that happen in the minds of people in the Middle East, especially women. I picked up this novel due to its spectacular predecessor, The Kite Runner. I must admit it did not live completely up to my expectations, but it came as close as it could. This book is by no means a light beach read. I absolutely loved it and look forward to reading it again!
B000NA2BEU|5.0|Veronica Mars is the best TV show ever, hands down.  To own the entire series on DVD is a must.  Hopefully, enough sales of Season 3 will lead to an eventual Season 4.  The CW Network has dropped our beloved Veronica, but Season 4 had started filming, and is being shopped around to other networks, with the possibility of a full length feature film in the future! :)    JS
0060005688|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. The author, while more of a scientist than a writer, does a fairly decent job at entertaining the reader with intriguing facts about how we choose certain things (food, lovers, jobs and more) and why we don't. The prose was light and at times humorous, making this book an enjoyable read.

1400063515|2.0|When I buy a non-fiction book, I expect just that. The author though uses fictional characters and circumstances to prove his points, which makes me wonder the validity of his content. Additionally, many sections seemed to get derailed from the chapter they were in, and all the name dropping became pretentious to say the least. And, after all that, the author still doesn't provide any practical approach to dealing with the ideas of Black Swans. I put the book down after about 100, tiring pages and went on to something else. I was disappointed to say the least.
B000P12LWY|4.0|Sean Bean would have been more accurate  as Henry seeing as he was 42 when he met Anne and he would have dyed his hair. Henry was ginger! The history is fiction but the production is brilliant, sexy and addictive. I'm so anticipating the next season and re-watching season one.
1582701709|2.0|The author of The Secret missed a key fact.  Yes the Law of Attraction exists just like the Law of Gravity.  BUT......  there are other forces at work in the world OTHER than the Law of Attraction (such AS the Law of Gravity for example) and many others.  The author opens with the genie analogy.  \\"Your wish is my command\\" and \\"You only have to ASK and Believe.\\"      And the author claims EVERYTHING in your life is there because you attracted it.  No, No, NO!!!  That's the inverse of the law of attraction and is NOT true.      I'd stick with Think and Grow Rich, which can be used to obtain goals other than wealth.  In that the author states right away that you have to be willing to pay the price to achieve your goal AND what you want can't violate the laws of science.    I'm not quite done listening to The Secret.  I have the audio version.  But I'll be reselling my copy of The Secret and keeping other books on getting what you want out of life instead.
0316010669|5.0|This is such an interesting book. It looks like a book about psychology, but the truth is, when I read on, I realize that the psychology factor, how we think in a snap second or \\"blink\\" is everywhere in our everyday lives.  The book also shows the very broad knowledge the author has.  When I am interested by the new ideas he presents, I am also learning so many things at the same time. It is a book that's worth reading and not at all a waste of time like some books are.<br /><br />Very importantly, this book does NOT say \\"Always judge a book by its cover.\\"  It suggests that sometimes our instinct does a better job; the other times careful examination and thinking process produce a better result than thin-slicing.  He also says that we still cannot conclude when exactly we should thin-slice and rely on our instinct. This is a book about his researches and studies on many cases where either instinct or thorough thinking is what IS helpful with solving a problem.<br /><br />Finally, don't try to skim or skip ahead in the book.  He is very smart about it.  He likes to repeat and conclude over and over to prove a point or compare throughout the book.
0061150142|4.0|A good summer read.  The Hartes and the Golds are more like family then neighbors.  Their kids, Chris and Emily, grow up grow up inseparable.  As they reach their teens, they become boyfriend and girlfriend.  Their parents are thrilled and everyone thinks they have the perfect relationship - from best friends to the loves of their lives.  When Emily dies things change.  Suicide or murder?  Did Chris make her do it or did they have a pact and he didn't follow-through?  The two families are now left to watch the investigation unfold.  And they know that both families have lost their past and their futures are changed forever.
B000V78BOY|5.0|I am surprised no one has still review this yet.  This is the first classical  HD DVD disc available in True HD.  The first one being Swan Lake and available only in DTS.  All I can say is that the performance is awesome!  I have watched it over and over again like 20 times.   I hope a professional review will appear soon.  Highly Recommended!
B000JK8OYU|3.0|I like the Beatles but this was nothing new or exciting.  Good songs but not that good.
0060589469|3.0|This book is far from light reading, and to be honest I'm not entirely sure what my overall impression was. On one hand I thought the incorporation of a Walden-like adventure mixed with philosophical propositions was fascinating and well integrated into the story. On the other hand the material was sometimes too dry and had repetitive, circular logic that seemed to be an exercise in rhetoric. At times I was completely engrossed and jotting down notes for further research, then at other times the writing seemed so trite that I found myself impatiently waiting to finish it. Overall the book is an intelligent work that has personally inspired a pursuit in philosophers such as Hume, Kant, and the Greeks. But an appreciation and prerequisite knowledge of these philosophers would have made the book far more accessible.
B000WGNLLW|3.0|I've been a fan since 1982. I'm 40 now, and I wanted this CD to be.. groundbreaking, if nothing else. No, in honesty, I wanted it to be a return to form from 5 guys who knew how to CRAFT a song. It seems that Andy (the 5th guy) saw that this was going to be a sellout to their label and a compromise; a denial of their innate abilities to write outstanding material; to write trendy soulless drivel and call it evolution, so he left. At the time I was floored, and I just *knew* we'd get a sub-par record.<br />Yes, I wanted an amalgamation of Rio,etc,etc, right through the Wedding Album, because I knew that's what these musicians are capable of, and I had faith in them to have confidence in their abilities. Looks like the record company did not have that faith.<br />I WISH above anything else that I could be holding the CD of the scrapped project in my hands instead of this.<br />I've loved these guys for 25 years, and will buy whatever they put out. But let's be HONEST, and listen with an honest ear and heart. The only good songs on here are:<br />*Last Man Standing - unbelievably, the last song! Finally, a melody, a hook!.. perhaps even underproduced, sounds like it was rushed to completion. By far the best song on this.. thing.<br />*Dirty Monster - a song, at least. Saxophone!~for gosh sakes, and not those disgusting tinny \\"tip-tip-tip\\" drums that Timbaland pushed the buttons for the rest of the project.. good to see they let Roger get behind a kit for a tune or two.<br />*Falling Down - not the worst tune I've suffered through this year. That's all the compliment I'll be giving. I suppose it *is* the only single they could consider! In the history of great DD songs, I give this a two out of ten.<br />*Box full of Honey - decent if DD was releasing a folk cd.<br />---If any other band had put this out, I would not have bought it. Any other band would get one of five Amazon stars.<br />Gone are atmospheric DD soundscapes. Gone is Andy's edgy guitar. Gone are Roger's driving drums. Gone are Simon's cryptic, poetic lyrics. John's energetic bassline returns for 30 seconds in the first song, and then he disappears.  Call this evolution, call this catching up with 'the times', but I call this far from what they are capable of. Sometimes you don't want to sound like the modern peers because those peers aren't in your league, so you'd be better off writing what you know, which surpasses and exceeds trends..<br />Please, Duran Duran, find yourselves again, and please fans, be honest when they don't live up to what we know they can deliver.ic, poetic lyrics.

B00005RG6B|4.0|If DTS Surround is a must requirement (like myself) for any music DVD purchase, then this disc is not for you. Amazon lists one of this discs formats as being encoded in DTS but that is not the case. I will have to do a little more research before I buy any other music DVD's from Amazon. Sound quality is good for Dolby and the footage is a little jumpy but overall it's a good rep of Queensryche's music.
B0000YEEGM|4.0|It's called the special edition which you have to admit is pretty hilarious.  (my brother is handicapped so I have immunity)
0143038419|1.0|What is it that compels people to buy this book? Even as I attempted to suspend judgment and read through to the end, there was never a point at which the author was capable of transcending her own experience -- and she is nothing but trite, terrible and vain throughout!  Apparently the author strikes some self-help, self-realization chord that is popular in our culture at the moment, but I do not believe this book will withstand the test of time.  It is very trite, terrible and vain throughout all three structured sections.

B000Y44LBG|5.0|I have come to realize that it is virtually impossible for the man known as Denzel Washington to make a horrible film. Denzel hasn't been this cold since \\"Training Day\\" and \\"Man on Fire\\" in my opinion. Denzel plays Frank Lucas, who eventually becomes a heroine kingpin after his boss, and mentor, dies in 70's Harlem. What makes Frank so different in the drug game is that his stuff isn't chopped up or diluted in any form, it's indeed the purest heroine that anyone has ever seen before. What makes this movie so good is that they actually show you how Frank succeeded in trafficking these drugs into the U.S for years without our government knowing anything about it. Don't get me wrong, I also wanna make mention of one of my favorite rappers too, and that's T.I who plays Stevie Lucas, and that's Franks nephew. With that said, Denzel made this movie once again. I know Russell Crowe is also in it, and he plays a cop who's just a little too honest (I don't know if I could've given back a million dollars cash money just like that) but he's trying to bring down the major players in the dope game after his friend and partner gets a bag of that good stuff and overdoses. Don't get me wrong, Russell Crowe is good, but make no mistake, Denzel is the star. Once again, he knocked it out of the park, and I think his fans will be thoroughly satisfied with this. I LOVED IT, LOVED IT, AND OH YEAH...LOVED IT!
B000K7VHQE|2.0|I got this DVD after my (admittedly abnormal) family raved about how hilarious it was and that it shouldn't be missed. (I'm thinking it gave them validation our family wasn't THE most bizarre .. back then, we didn't know the word dysfunctional existed or that it applied to nearly every family).     I kept waiting and waiting for it to become hilarious while beginning to feel nearly as depressed as some of the (somewhat stereotypical) characters in the movie.  If you're looking for a comedy, be forewarned the humor in this movie tends toward the dark and is probably not age appropriate for younger children.     Yes, there were scenes and moments that were amusing - sometimes for the shock value and sometimes because it was reminiscent of the angst and quirkiness that exists within our own families - or for the simple absurdity.  The scenes with the van were like a flashback to my youth, although our own experiences weren't quite so dramatic or funny.      I considered not finishing the movie, but realized it had drawn me in enough that I had to see it through to the conclusion.  I won't reveal the ending, but it did live up to hilarious and unexpected.  If I had to do it all over again, I have to admit I'd have passed on this one.  It's rather like an endless joke that is painful to see through to the conclusion but you're rewarded for your tenacity with a good laugh. I don't remember the screen time, but it was too long to be worth it for me.  While the movie has it's quirky charm, I can't say I really recommend it as a comedy.
1572814349|3.0|It is very beautiful, the package and the card, but I did not like the imagens, they looks like Victorian Age.  I like more fantasy and so.  In fact I given them away to someone. I  did not keep them.

B0006GVJEE|2.0|I am not happy w/ the way I received this DVD. When I took it out of the box it was shipped in, I could tell that the DVD was loose in its case, rolling around. It is a Christmas gift so I am not opening it to check it. I am going to hope that the DVD is not scratched. I am very upset that the DVD showed up in this condition, and now I have to hope it's ok to give as a Christmas gift.
B000WCBPOG|4.0|Totally fun and enjoyable versions of all those Beatles songs you know too well. Refreshing!
0312360266|1.0|This book was boring. It had these long paragraphs that could go on for pages. I could barely even get through the novel.   It took me like 3 months to read it because I kept falling asleep.   Vampire books are my fav, my bookshelves are full of them, and this novel is not a good Vampire book. The plot was good, but she didn't write it well, or something. It sucked.
B000W4HJ44|5.0|This movie was so amazing. John Travolta, Nikki Blonsky, Christopher Walken, EVERYONE did phenomenal. I was practically dancing out of the movie theater and still...after I bring it home, it still has the same affect on me. I truly love this movie more then any musical I have ever seen. Thats really all I can say. It was amazing, and all of the haters out there do not know what they are missing.
B000R8YC3G|4.0|This movie though it had it's moments just wasn't all that funny. It's a spoof off of dawn of the dead, but it was kind of weak IMO. They could have done better as far as I was concerned.<br /><br />I give it a 4 because it still is a good movie and the video quality is great.<br /><br />HD-Video: Great quality all throughout, I don't recall any bad video or anything of the type.
B000066AXE|5.0|This is a truly beautiful movie and probably Ron Howard's best work IMHO.  It's a lesson of how one man fought off his demons, real and imagined, with the loving help of his wife and a commitment to discipline his own mind.    Direction, acting, writing, cinematigraphy, music... it's a perfect storm of great cinema.    Regarding the DVD there is one thing to keep in mind... be careful to check the aspect ratio of the DVD you buy.  There are many different versions of this title, apparently I got stuck with a lemon as I wanted the \\"widescreen\\" version but got, instead the \\"fullscreen\\" version.    They trick you here... \\"FULL Screen\\"??  Is this as opposed to \\"Half-Screen\\"?  It's a misleading term that makes you think it's \\"widescreen\\" but it's not -as the aspect ratio is only 1:33-1.  If you want the real FULL screen -as it was in the theater, make sure the copy you buy is 1:85-1.
0786838655|5.0|I was recommended this book by a friend of mine and I had to ordered it from the US cause it was sold out where I live (Philippines). When I received I thought my son would not like to read such a big book but I was in for a big surprise.  Let me tell you my 10 year old son is also dyslexic and ALWAYS try to read the smallest books if possible. The moment he open this book that was it, instant hook up! He was not done reading this one that he was asking me to buy the rest of the series. I bought last week \\"The sea of monsters\\" and he has been in trouble because he even missed one soccer club in school cause he wanted to read... It never happened before, trust me! I'm delighted to see my son so much into reading and having so much fun with a book.   Thank you so much Mr. Riordan and  keep the stories coming!!

0975991477|5.0|I was thrilled to read this book. Why? Finally, so much of my own experience in this life begins to make sense when it comes to energy. When I was a child, I noticed that in my large family, each person perceived the \\"same\\" experience in a different way. One family, several different realities. Perception seems to be guided by energy, emotion, experience.... Lipton describes quite well how a thought can push energy in a direction that validates one's belief. Sadly, that validation can focus on Mis-information as easily as it can focus on the truth.  I have to agree that not all Scientist are great writers, and I keep this in mind when I read this book. I've been careful not to let certain phrases throw me off the beautiful path that this book delicately offers to the reader.
B000EWBKKI|2.0|I've had a blu-ray player for awhile now (PS3) but recently purchased an LCD TV and couldn't wait to check out a DVD on it and get the full on experience.  I thought Terminator 2, one of the best looking films of all time, would be a great movie to start with.  Upon popping it in I was instantly disappointed.  There is virtually no difference between this and a standard release.  Trust me after a couple minutes you're looking hard for a reason why you just paid $25 for a DVD and when you can't find anything of consequence you're gonna be disappointed.<br /><br />I mean, obviously it's going to look better on a nice LCD TV but that's about all I got.  A total waste in my opinion.  I hope I can find some blu-ray discs of some decent quality because this has nearly crushed my confidence in the technology right from the get go.  No way I'm picking up more expensive versions of movies for the same picture quality.  Start checking out reviews before you buy because it's no worth another cent if this is what you get.
B0002KPIQY|1.0|Just because everyone is in love w/ her lips and looks...... it doesnt make the movie any good!  Pitiful and bland --- would rather watch old episodes of Fraggle Rock!
B00003CXTG|1.0|Put extremely attractive young men and women into the fashions of 1941 but with the moral attitudes of the 21st century, add special effects, completely throw out any basis in actual fact in order to get an emotional reaction from the audience (here the film succeeds for all the wrong reasons), add a few rousing speeches, and you have Pearl Harbor. The only good thing about this film are the special effects, and even then I prefer the more primitively done Tora,Tora,Tora from thirty years before because it actually tells the truth about what led up to the raid in painstaking detail, actually taking the time to show what is going on with both the Japanese and the Americans and the mistakes and misjudgements made on both sides. If you want steamy love scenes and nicely done explosions, watch this film. If you want to learn something about history watch Tora, Tora, Tora. You won't regret it.
B000055YG6|5.0|Director Sam Mendes is a very well known Theater director in England . He had directed actors like Judi Dench and Ralph Fiennes in classical roles, working with the Royal Shakespeare Company.  He directed Nicole Kidman in THE BLUE ROOM. He won a Tony for his Broadway revival of CABARET. Considered an \\"actor's director\\", Steven Spielberg (Filmworks produced the film) personally recommended Mendes for the director's chair. With an ample budget, Mendes was able to rehearse his actors for two weeks before shooting started. This always tightens dialogue and deepens characterizations. He also encouraged improvisation during the shoot. BEAUTY was his feature film debut. He did his homework, and came prepared with his story boards completed, and the movie clearly in his head. He has gone on to direct other fine films including ROAD TO PERDITION (2002), and JARHEAD (2005), which turned out to be a strong anti-war film in the guise of a gung-ho actioner.  He has been called the \\"new\\" Kubrick by some. He is married to Kate Winslet, and they have homes in London and California .<br /><br />Alan Ball, who wrote the screenplay, is a noted New York playwright. He was having lunch one windy day at the World Trade Center Plaza , and he watched a paper bag frisking and floating in the breeze; giving him the inspiration to write first a play, and then a screenplay. The theatrical version has never been produced. An outspoken gay activist and practitioner, he weaved the homosexual references expertly into the fabric of the story. It was not overdone, and it was certainly not overlooked. Much of the final action of the plot hinged on homophobia and closeted eroticism.<br /><br />One of the most striking things about the movie was the astonishingly good cinematography by veteran cameraman Conrad L. Hall. He won an Oscar for his effort on the film. He gave us some masterful set ups that played lovingly with light and shadow, a bit reminiscent of James Wong Howe. I really noticed this by accident when I viewed the movie in black and white as a mistake of projection. The color red was the prominent motif for much of the movie--deep red roses in vases in nearly every room in the Burnham household, roses dominating the garden along the white picket fence, the only house in the neighborhood with a bright red door, a 1970 red Pontiac Firebird, and of course blood, which makes an appearance as well. In addition Lester's middle-aged fantasies and dreams about young Angela were dripping with red rose petals, bursting from her unzipped bodice, covering the ceiling as she hovered there, filling the steaming tub that she languished in while \\"awaiting\\" him. Secondary to a short shooting schedule several of the scenes had to be shot at night, and Hall had to light them to appear as day shots. He was very successful in this endeavor.<br /><br />The wonderfully pounding driving musical score was written by veteran composer Thomas Newman. Mendes was interested in unique scoring, percussion and mallet instruments -and this intriguing thwacking moved the plot along, all the while building tension and interest. Later Newman and Conrad Hall teamed up again with Mendes when they made ROAD TO PERDITION (2002).<br /><br />Kevin Spacey was excellent, pitch perfect, on the mark as Lester Burnham, a kind of 90's Willy Loman. Being faced with depression, discontent, unfulfilled sexual needs, and a mid-life crisis, somehow he found the presence of mind to put his world in order. To our delight he told off his dreary supervisor, told him where to shove their job, and then blackmailed the boss for a tidy sum, citing administrative misuse of funds for libation and prostitutes. He rushed away from the white collar stress, and blissfully got a job flipping burgers at Smiley's, became infatuated with his daughter's friend, Angela, began pumping iron to impress her, became a stoner buying from Ricky, the kid next door, and he purchased his fantasy car--a 1970 red Firebird. In the midst of all this bizarre behavior, he rediscovered himself, saying that he \\"was tired of being treated that I don't exist.\\"<br /><br />Annette Bening as the wife, Carolyn, infused the part with a focused, mannered, manic  hectic energy, misdirecting her considerable passion toward her garden and career at the expense of her relationship with her family, and her marriage. She was a walking jabbering divorce waiting to happen. Oddly I detected a slight lisp in her dialogue that I had not noticed in her past performances; maybe it was character driven. Thora Birch, a child actress all grown up at 17 years old, played daughter Jane. Her nude scene was daring and unexpected. She underplayed and worked well with her eyes - her timing and transitions were bang on. We all have known this teenager in our lives. Chris Cooper was very intense, real, and dislikable as Col. Frank Fitts, USMC. It was not clear to me whether he was active duty or retired. In one of the earlier drafts of the screenplay, we discovered that Fitts had a gay lover that had died in Viet Nam . I am sad that bit was cut. It could have given even more depth to the Colonel; of course that depended on when it was revealed. The kiss in the rain scene was wonderfully shocking, and it certainly did not need to be deleted. Wes Bentley was mercurial, magnetic, creepy, and very self-assured as the \\"strange kid\\" next door, Ricky Fitts. He played him so clever that Ricky was always two jumps ahead of his parents, his teachers, and his school mates. Beyond being the new kid in school, he was extra hard to get to know. Neighbor Jane was at first creeped out by him, than she became fascinated as she learned to appreciate his intellect and sensitivity, as they became an item. Allison Janney played his put-upon wife, Barbara; her almost catatonic stillness was haunting and horrific--a woman who had chosen to shut down rather than live in a battle zone. Mena Suvari, also a child actress, was 19 years old when she shot BEAUTY. She was tantalizing and tragic as Miss Popular, Angela Hayes, who incessantly talked about sex to mantle her lack of experience and her lack of courage. Getting by all her life on her looks, nevertheless she had no real self-confidence. She wanted to be a teen model, but one got the feeling that she lacked the drive to make it happen. She was 19 years old when she filmed BEAUTY.<br /><br />I loved the film, and have enjoyed repeated viewings. It is a very dark comedy that became a drama as it played out. The tragedy was connected to the humor, and yet I continuously hoped that Lester will be spared; and he never was. It is like I feel each time I watch WEST SIDE STORY (1961), hoping that Tony will not be shot during the next viewing, or that Kirk Douglas will make it out of SPARTACUS without being crucified.  Thank God the director edited out the original ending where Jane and Ricky were brought to trial and then jailed for Lester's murder, as the Colonel's wife destroyed the bloody t-shirt.t of all this bizarre behavior, he rediscovered himself, saying that he \\"was tired of being treated that I don't exist.\\"<br /><br />Annette Bening as the wife, Carolyn, infused the part with a focused, mannered, manic  hectic energy, misdirecting her considerable passion toward her garden and career at the expense of her relationship with her family, and her marriage.

1594489505|5.0|This book was a great insight into the lives of women and others in Afghanistan. I listened to the audio version while driving on a trip and was completely enthralled with it. I was so enraptured that I'm surprised I didn't have a wreck or swerve off the road. While there are many \\"disturbing\\" aspects to the story which made me nauseous or cry, the true essence of life for Afghanis couldn't have been conveyed any better or without these scenes. This is a wonderful book and very pertinent to our times. Any time you can read a book that gives you insight into another country or culture in such and interesting way, you just can't pass it up. This is one of those.
B000003TAW|5.0|I know Sgt. Pepper's, Zeppellin IV,  Paul's Boutique, and The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan might be right up there, but dang it if I just don't get tired of this thing.  This album is perfect from start to finish.  I've owned it for years and I still listen to it all the time.  Buy this album.  I recommend buying the 2-disc special edition, though, because some of the songs on the second disc are outstanding, too (even if you weren't into them back in 1994).
B0002V7O3I|5.0|I loved this movie when I was a kid and I still love it today. When you look back on movies that you watched when you were a kid you realize how times have changed.  But what doesn't change are the memories you had when you first watched that movie or seeing people in movies that know of now.  I just love seeing Ethan Hawke and River Phoenix as nerds.  It is a role that they only played once, which makes this movie a must.
0374105235|5.0|i dont normally read a lot ,but i picked up this book and ended up reading it in one day.it amazes me that in todays world that children have to go though such ordeals.
1582701709|4.0|I began reading this book as the biggest cynic in the world. I didn't think there was any way that utilizing positive visual imagery could be hugely effective. So I read the book. And I tried it. and, to a large extent, it worked.     \\"The Secret\\" preaches positive thinking and expecting things to go right and putting out positive energy into the world...all good things. I think the critics of this are greatly overreacting. What's the downside of encouraging people to visualize a better world?     Which is not to say \\"The Secret\\" is perfect. At some points it tends to skew into some bizarre self help rant...I read a HILARIOUS send up/parody of books like \\"The Secret\\" in a book called \\"Maybe Life's Just Not That Into You.\\" Funniest book of the year. [[ASIN:1582296596 Maybe Life's Just Not That Into You: When You feel Like the World's Voted You Off]]    Is \\"The Secret\\" the most influential book ever written, as some claim? I don't think so. What it does do is present a fresh way of looking at the world. A way that may help people lead a better, more fulfilling life. And what's wrong with that?
B000SUKPKM|5.0|This is an amazing album.  I absolutely love it and can't even count how many times I've listened to it, since I bought it two weeks ago.  Strong songs.  Thoughtful lyrics.  Exceptionally talented musicians.  Can't go wrong with this one!  By the way, when the CD was first released, I found out that the Goo Goo Dolls were going to perform at a local L.A. electronics/CD/DVD store.  I'd never gone to any of their concerts before, and I went there, expecting to hear, maybe, three songs performed in some corner of the store.  WRONG!  A full-size stage was set up in the parking lot, complete with elaborate lighting and sound.  About 300 lucky fans were treated to a nothing-held-back, 35-40 minute concert.  (You can probably find it somewhere, online.  Cameras, camera phones, and video cameras were allowed.)  Afterwards, Warner Bros. workers handed out free posters and the three band members signed autographs inside the store.  Very nice guys.  Very, very, very good CD.
630529142X|5.0|My husband loves this movie so much that I am buying it for him again.
B000W4KT64|3.0|A movie with lots of energy. It does'nt stop..it goes on and on with musical<br />numbers,good acting, dancing and we get to see great actors like Christopher<br />and John Travolta take on roles that they would usually not do. Lots of fun,<br />and if you have music in your heart....you wont fall asleep on this one.
B000024D4R|3.0|This is a CD you would probably want in your collection if you are a big fan of Pink Floyd. Although non essential it is neither their best effort nor is it noteworthy for the time period. This album seems only a transition between their greatest efforts namely Wish You Were Here and The Wall. Best song on the album \\"Sheep\\", which is probably the most indicative of Pink's style and greatness. I always thought Waters and Gilmore were torn between the \\"animals\\" they perceived in society and in the vein of the classic 'Animal Farm'.
B000UR9TQO|4.0|Leave it to Jimmy Page, to put out another remastered copy of something and it sell like hotcakes... I'm not hating on the man, just mearly making a point.<br /><br />I've had a version of this, since the early days... I've still got the LP.  My main complaint, and it's a small one at that, is he cut out part of Whole Lotta Love.  For those who have yet to hear the originals, be it LP or the first CD... There is quite a hole in the song, and the editing is quite abrupt when that part is removed... For those of us who recall... has anybody seen the bridge.<br /><br />As the DVD goes, I'd be a bit leary on getting that, as I've read they weren't able to doctor the video footage, only the musical aspect of it.  The DVD, when it first came out, was a pure let down, not from the music that was worked on in this project, but the video is far from perfect.<br /><br />From a Led Zeppelin fans perspective, I would forgo the DVD, and pick up the live DVD collection that came out a few years ago. It's far more pleasing to view.  However, if you are a diehard fan, the one who has to have every piece of material that comes out... Go for it.
B000002UB3|5.0|ESSENTIAL ALBUM!!! One of rock's greatest albums by the Fab Four. It's one of my personal favorites & it's a rare thing when I don't play it. The album hit #1 on the charts & deservedly so. Without a weak moment, this album flows from beginning to end; the Beatles once again proving their prowess in the studio. This was actually the last album that the Beatles recorded but, due to the untimely disappearance of Phil Spector, Let It Be was the last album released.<br /><br />Abbey Road had two incredible hits released from it, \\"Come Together\\" which topped the charts #1 & \\"Something\\" which peaked at #3 (what???). Somewhat of a surprise was that wasn't a McCartney penned tune released as a single, though Sir Paul tried everything he could to get \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" released as one. But, let's face it, as light as the song sounds, mass murderers isn't great subject manner for lyrics. \\"Oh! Darling\\" was the song that should have released as a single. It's in 6/8 time & is a kind of throwback to old rock 'n' roll. McCartney's vocals on this song are some of the grittiest he ever recorded. \\"Oh! Darling\\" was one of the best album tracks on any Beatles album. \\"Octopus's Garden\\", written by Ringo, is non-essential. Then, what was side 1 on the vinyl record, closed with Lennon's \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\", a great bluesy riff & solid vocals makes this a must-hear song. With it's heavy riff-laden slow fadeout makes it a perfect song ending that side of the record. This part of the album was a concession to Lennon's desires to record a straight ahead rock album.<br /><br />The other side of that coin is that side two was to be McCartney's side with his desire to make a more continuous rock-suite, this didn't quite happen but many of the songs do segue from one to the next. This side began with Harrison's \\"Here Comes the Sun\\". It's one of his best songs & could have been released as a single. \\"Because\\" is a slow song with a lot of three part harmony. It's some of their best harmony work ever recorded. It's amazing in light of the fact that when each one recorded his vocal, the other two weren't even present. The proper part of the rock suite begins with \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\". This theme would recur on a later song on Abbey Road; this is where McCartney began incorporating this idea into his music, he would use it time & again in his solo recordings. \\"Sun King\\" follows next & was originally titled \\"Here Comes the Sun King\\", Lennon used some faux foreign language words to give it the feel that he wanted. Two more Lennon fragments follow, \\"Mean Mr. Mustard\\" & \\"Polythene Pam\\". Both have humorous lyrics, the latter one I found to be very comical. Lennon was a master of lyrics, able to be humorous & insightful at the same time. A McCartney song is next, \\"She Came in Through the Bathroom Window\\", it's a nonsensical title but the line \\"she could steal but she could not rob\\" is a classic. \\"Golden Slumbers\\" is a beautiful McCartney composition though he did nick some of the lyrics from a 400 year old poem by Thomas Dekker. \\"Carry That Weight\\" follow & is a great singalong, the musical & lyrical theme from \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" is repeated here. What was listed as the final song in the initial Abbey Road release is \\"The End\\". The title is a prophetical one & one of the most adventurous things they ever did. We get a short drum solo from Ringo, the only one that was recorded, there's an incredible three guitar lead where McCartney, Lennon & Harrison take turns playing their riffs, then we get to the slow ending. Lennon commented on the line written by McCartney, \\"the love you take is equal to the love you make\\", Lennon thought that was one of the best lyrics that McCartney ever wrote. This is all followed by \\"Her Majesty\\" the shortest Beatles song recorded. It was really a throwaway but was saved by an engineer & spliced on to the end of \\"The End\\" because it had been instructed to never throw away anything that had been recorded.<br /><br />Unless you're from somewhere else (say, a galaxy far, far away) then you've heard this album. One of the most creative pieces of music in the annals of rock 'n' roll!u're from somewhere else (say, a galaxy far, far away) then you've heard this album.

B000UGG3A0|3.0|If you're new the to DKM, you'll love it.  It has all the catchy tunes and radio-friendly cuts that will keep you listening.  If you're longing for the days for 'Do or Die' or even 'The Gang's All Here', this one might leave you a little disappointed.  All in all, it's middle-of-the-road and I'm hoping that their next album will be a little stronger - more heart and less fluff.

B000VNMMR0|4.0|Underworld Director Len Wiseman does a fantastic job of giving us a new Die Hard movie. Fun and action-packed to watch, the new Die Hard is never dull nor boring.    Bruce Willis looks great and proves that the Die Hard action actors can still kick it old school! Solid casting - for the most part - and a somewhat new look to the franchise created a fresher look at the continuing series to create a breath of fresh air in action/adventure movies.     We will be purchasing this DVD in the near future.

0307276902|4.0|There has been much hype over the factual accuracy of this book.  I'm going to skip over all of that and simply state that there is no denying that whether or not things where exaggerated throughout Frey's memoir, it remains an overall entertaining read.<br /><br />When I first read the back cover of this book I was fascinated and felt compelled to read it.  \\"How does one at 23 years old find themselves already so lost in the world?\\" I had to ask myself.  Frey goes in depth into his emotional turmoil, confusion, and frustration with himself that brought him to such a staggering point at such a young age.  Sadly, Frey is by far not the only one to have experienced this, and at such a young age.  It gives the reader an insight into the world and struggles of addition and substance abuse that many of us cannot begin to understand.<br /><br />This book was an overall fascinating read.  My only complaints however, is that it was at times rather monotonous.  I found that at times it was overly verbose on the same idea. But moreover, what really bothered me was the complete lack of proper use of grammar.  At times I found it extremely uncomfortable to read with run on sentences, lack of commas, and lack of quotation's, etc.  If you think that excessive improper grammar is something that you just can't stomach for over 400 pages, I wouldn't recommend this.  But if you're looking for an insightful, fascinating, and entertaining look into the world of substance abuse and recovery, this is a must read.

0307346617|4.0|World War Z is an entertaining and informative book written in a unique style by Max Brooks. Instead of writing a standard novel, Brooks approaches his subject of zombie armageddon as if it were factual and historic. It is a chronicle of the people who experienced the catastrophe and the lessons learned from it. Brooks treats his subject seriously--there are few tongue-in-cheek moments--and he must have researched the ways governments respond to disasters because almost everything (except for the zombies) seems plausible.    The book's best element is the insight. Brooks examines how people would respond to zombies nationally, culturally, and personally. I like many of the details, from the role of K-9s, to the effects of conventional weapons on zombies, to the quislings and ferals and zombies that thaw in the spring. He focuses a lot of things that the zombie movies never cover.    The book is arranged as a series of interviews because the journalist narrator wants to emphasize the \\"human factor\\". Although many of the interviews sound the same, this approach is overall effective; however I hope that Brooks will write a narrative about World War Z in the future.  The best way to capture the human factor is to create and develop characters. World War Z introduces interesting characters, but we do not spend enough time with them. I would like to see a novel featuring these characters confronting, enduring, and surviving World War Z.      As far as I know, there is no definitive zombie novel. I think that Max Brooks is the man to write one.
0609610570|5.0|While a little a dry at times, this book provides great detail on how companies differentiate themselves by not only telling, but doing!  Execution and communication seem to be the two biggest impediments to a successful business and this book outlines how to best manage through the first.  There are several specific examples of how good execution can literally make a company....with that, I do recommend this book to any biz owners interested in improving their chances of success!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|What makes a movie great is its ability to draw us to an important moral.  Ratatouille excels at this.  One of the problems with the education of children today is that it is me-centered.  In other words, our society tells children that everyone is special, you can be whatever you want to be, and nothing is more important than your dreams.  Ratatouille smashes that concept.  How important or special one may be, in the end, is not important; because, after all, there is not much separating a great chef from a garbage boy.  The talents we possess are only important in so much as we can better the lives of others with them.  What is important in life is family, friends, and other people, and that is what Ratatouille emphasizes!
0671015206|5.0|Wow!  What great insights, as backed by years of analytical detail.  Who would have thought that MOST millionaires are just look like you and I on the outside.  They live normal lives, perhaps even more frugal than us at times.  But yet, they have mastered the art of saving.  I learned that it does not matter how much money you make, it is how much money you have that matters.  I recommend this book to anyone with the dream of retiring with millions.....but be ready, you likely need to start making changes right now.

B000W1V5VU|1.0|Assemble an all star cast, throw in the money, add good visual effects, and what do we have? We have a real stinker,little more than a modern day version of the classic \\"The Sting\\". Redford and Newman would be on the floor in stitches watching this pathetic debacle. In the first place, there are just too many people running around,and even though each player fulfills his role, the characters actually tend to distract rather than attract the viewer. Secondly, Clooney fails to step forward as the leader of this retaliatory project; instead of Superman, the audience gets Clark Kent.Pacino tries mightily to be the \\"heavy\\", yet things get so bad at the end that this mobster can easily be taken as a sympathetic character; certainly not what was intended.Looking for a Christmas gift for your worst enemy? You've definitely come to the right \\"casino\\".
B0007P0LO8|3.0|We were disappointed with this first viewing of Madama Butterfly. We found it melodramatic rather than tragic which may be attributed to the production. The flashbacks, dream sequences and \\"inner thought vocals\\" were annoying, the lighting was poor and too contrived in many of the scenes, the staging was good but not great and fading between scenes was disastrous. The vocals were very good... but I love Freni.

032147404X|4.0|THE DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY BOOK    The Digital Photography Book serves as a quick reference guide for beginners to intermediate photographers on issues from focusing to what equipment to purchase; from composition to the digital printing process.  The book is relatively short and each point or technique that he discuses, only takes a page to explain.  The writing technique of Scott Kelby in this particular book, makes the reader feel as if he were out on a photo shoot with you.  As Kelby says in his introduction, he is giving tips as if you were a buddy of his out shooting photos with him.  He is trying to give pointers for everyday situations such as weddings, people, landscapes, and travel.  He gives almost 200 tips.  Some of his tips are oversimplified and not every situation he describes can use his \\"technique\\", but his general rules will help produce better photos for the everyday photographer.  The tips he does give can also be used for film photography.  When Scott does explain a technique, such as shooting flowers, he does it in a straight-forward, easy to understand practical method without a lot of technical jargon.  Yet, each tip has enough detail that I got a better idea of how F-stops and focal lengths affect my photos.  I also learned how and what lenses to use.  Not only does the book give shooting tips for special situations, it talks about aperature speeds, macros shooting and a page about sport shooting.     At the back of the book, there is a Chapter entitled \\"Photo Recipes to Help You Get the Shot\\", where Scott shows a particular type of photo effect, such as smooth and silky water and dramatic skies in a landscape shot, and tells you step by step what you need to do to replicate the shot.   Along with Scott's helpful hints and techniques, he offers suggestions for equipment that can be used to help make the photos you are taking turn out better.  Scott talks about the equipment you need over and above your camera to get the shots you want; i.e, tripod, ballhead, cable release, and level.  He gives suggestions from the most expensive to the least, even gives alternatives you can use in a pinch.  When he does recommend new equipment, he is very specific about the band and model.   After reading this book, I have it in my camera bag and take it everywhere with me.  I look at it at least a couple times a week.  There is always a situation where I pull it out and refer to it.  It is a great resource book without all the technical jargon.  As a beginning photography lover, this is just the book I needed, but I would also recommend it to more experienced photographers, just for insight into how another photographer shoots certain situations.
0345494997|3.0|Loving Frank tells the truly remarkable story of Mamah Cheney and Frank Lloyd Wright's passionate, doomed love. These real-life characters are endlessly fascinating, and Horan has a pleasant writing style. So why did I feel so unsatisfied?    Mamah was a scholar, an early feminist, a woman willing to abandon the mores of the day to grasp what she most wanted from her life. That is described in these pages, but I don't know that the character we're being told about is the one we're really seeing. In this rendering, she's almost precocious, rather predictable, and not especially spirited. These pages are enormously skimmable. Very little of substance seems to be happening line by line--it's almost like you're reading from a distance.    For a first novel, it's certainly ambitious, and it doesn't fail. It just doesn't succeed. Maybe freed from the need to keep to a historical story, Horan would have the chance to really shine. And maybe if this story was written about by a subtler writer, it would pack more punch.
0143038419|3.0|Entertaining, but I learned less than I thought I would about the \\"search for everything across Italy, India, and Indonesia\\". I expected more. Much more. I imagined it to be the ultimate guide to pursuing and finding happiness, and a great heroic adventure.   But nay, at least 2/3 of the time she spoke of only HER feelings, HER desires, and HER failures. During those times, she was very egotistical, but even so, I couldn't help but grow to like her through her writing. Like she said, she can make friends with anybody.     Unfortunately, it took an effort to finish. She lost my appeal whenever she became immensely self-absorbed, which happened more than often.   If it hadn't been for the high rating and popularity, I would've given up enduring her big ego long ago. Sometimes I wish she kept some of her thoughts about herself to herself.     But even though this barely passes for enlightening material, it's still a good read for some laughs.   ...Although I didn't laugh at all, it still made me smile inside.
1594489505|5.0|Hosseini takes us into the private world of three generations living through the tumultuous events of the past three decades in Afghanistan from the Soviet occupation through to the ousting of the Taliban. The story is about ordinary people trying to get on with their lives as the world as they know it falls apart around them. The characters are vibrant and complex and Hosseini's prose brings their struggles, their fears and their hopes to life in a very tangible way. Sometimes a fictional interpretation of history is exactly what we need in order to be able to come to a real understanding of what it meant to live through historic events, particularly horrific ones. Hosseini shepherds us to this kind of understanding. We live through the horrors, the struggles and the hellishly difficult decisions as the characters face them.     The real beauty of the novel is in its resolution. Hosseini does not succumb to the temptation to give us a simplistic happy ending, which may make us feel good, but which would betray the reality. Nevertheless he manages to convey redemption and optimism. You will finish the book wishing you could step into the pages and meet the characters who have emerged from suffering with such a resilient sense of hope and a solicitude for the needs of others that leaves us awestruck.

B00005JMCW|4.0|Only Hollywood can invent such a comedy, but what a comedy indeed ! Imagine a mother and a daughter in the trap of some Chinese magic and the mother is the daughter and vice versa till a certain prediction is fulfilled. And the mother-daughter is getting ready for her re-marrying on the following day, and the daughter-mother is to perform in a rock concert and is falling in love for a young high-school junior or so. And, etc. ... Imbroglio upon imbroglio. When you get one, like one spaghetto I guess, you never see the end of its multiplication, like with spaghetti I guess again. Funny, light, extremely superficial but definitely entertaining and pervaded with enough empathy not to be turned off or down by the over-sentimental and don't-start-all-that-mess-again ending.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
B00004XPPK|4.0|Do not ever exclude the young Rita Hayworth playing the title role of Gilda as one of the classic film femme fatales. In this story line she is a lady with a shady past who finds herself married on the rebound to a casino owner in South America. As fate would have it the ex-boyfriend whom she threw over found himself a cushy job as more than willing ambitious front man for the devious and maniacal casino owner. From Gilda's first appearance, however, the show is all about her. Every move Gilda makes, every move her husband and her ex-beau make only add fuel to her showcase performance. And she dances and sings a little too. But mainly she is drop-dead beautiful with a devilish smile. The story line plays second fiddle here. And for that you can definitely put the blame on Mame.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Jane Austen was meticulous and methodical. Her stories start with a slowness and want of action that tempt one to think nothing is developing.  Readers of Jane Austen know better. So with this marvelous story. My hat is off to the directing, and especially to the cinematography. Look for the complex long scenes that are done in a single take. This is art.
B000002P7R|5.0|In 1968 I bought an import version of the album \\"Smash Hits\\" on it was an incredible piece called \\"Stars That Play With Laughing Sam's Dice\\" I was a chemistry major in high school so I got it right away. I've been looking for a copy (digital) since 1981. I just couldn't seem to find it anywhere. I finally looked it up in a music store's resource and found it had been released on this CD. This CD (to me) is worth the price for this one song alone. I once again get to laugh along with Mr. Jimi under the influence of \\"Stars That Play With Laughing Sam's Dice\\"

B00005ASOI|3.0|I consider myself an avid horror fan. I like the classics- TCM, Hills Have Eyes, Re-Animator, anything Romero... And I'll give any horror movie a shot. I had heard only good things about Suspiria, so naturally I was excited to add it to my collection. In hindsight, I could have done without buying it. It is worth watching, but may be better suited as a mid-week Blockbuster selection. It is a standard Argento flick, with obvious nuances of Italian cinema. Some implied scenes, some gore. Acting is OK, audio quality at times was questionable. Plot moved along on the slow side. I would say it avoids a lot of the typical horror \\"campiness\\" until the end. The finale just made me chuckle and made my girlfriend roll her eyes. Overall, I could take it or leave it.
B00008CMR6|5.0|Another awesome West with John Wayne.    Really wish the \\"DUKE\\" was still alive making movies and kicking some those little pretty boys in Hollyweird like Tom Cruise's backsides.
B000JVT1U0|5.0|I'll give any horror movie a try. Wicker Man turned out to be an instant classic! Not to be confused with the new one, which pales in comparison. This is a creepy and disturbing movie with twists. It's plot revolves around a secluded island inhabited by a strange cult. Each discovery gets Christopher Lee closer to the truth, which he regrets getting involved in. If you can, go for the collector's edition that comes in a wooden box. It is the same content, but more of an asset to a nice collection. Overall, you can't leave this out of your horror must-haves!

B000VNMMQG|5.0|This is an excellent, must-see film!  This film has inspired me to learn and read more about William Wilberforce as well as the other characters around him such as William Pitt who became Britain's youngest prime minister ever at the age of only 24, the quest to end the African slave trade, and British history in the late 18th and early 19th centuries!  The storyline is also inspirational in remembering that anyone can affect significant and positive changes with persistance!  And instead of all the negative, violent and hateful movies out there, this one will make you smile.

B0002IU988|5.0|This is one of the best rock bands ever formed,simply because they offer something to everbody who is a fan of the genre. From the well-written melody of In Loving Memory and Open Your Eyes to the sheer ferocity and heaviness of Watch Your Words and Metalingus Alter Bridge's One Day Remains is an album that needs to be in the collection of anyone who remotely enjoys this type of music. A couple of other stand-outs on this disc are the title track with is speedy riffs and upbeat feel (which continues to make my jaw drop due to its showing that even bands formed after 2000 can actually have TALENT!!!)and Find The Real showcasing its slow yet super-catchy beat.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I'm not going to go into all the details, others have already done that. I'll just say that this is simply the best concert dvd that I have ever bought. I never got a chance to see PF live so this is the next best thing for me. I know Waters isn't here, but his replacement is a fine bass player and sings his parts well enough. To me, Gilmour was the voice and the sound (guitar genious) of Floyd anyway. Don't hesitate to buy this one !!!
B000SO7OM0|5.0|Sensational!! A feast for the eyes & ears, she has the voice of an angel. The setting and the selection of the material was just wonderful. To see and hear the fusion of traditional instruments with more conventional instruments just goes to prove that music is truly universal and crosses all cultures. I have only one regret and that is I missed her tour of Australia some years back. The regret has just become a bit greater.
0670033375|5.0|I was a big fan of \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" and \\"Why is Sex Fun?\\". It was pretty much a guarantee that I was going to like \\"Collapse\\" and I do. One very smart thing that Diamond does is that he doesn't start out talking about some ancient civilization and then move chronologically toward the present day. Instead, he starts with modern day Montana and lays the groundwork for what he will be covering later on. I suppose everyone will find different sections interesting. I like the parts where he compares two similar situations and uses that comparison to bring out the sharp differences. He did this with Iceland/Greenland and Haiti/Dominican Republic.  It is not a requirement to read \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" first but you will want to read one after you read the other.
B000OLGCI4|4.0|Great fun movie that hasn't lost its appeal even for us who could remember the first version! The digital adaptation makes it come alive; a treat for all us kids everywhere.
B000OV170W|1.0|I was actually angry when I finished reading the book - it was a HUGE waste of time.  The ending is a major cop-out, and the characters are painful clichés.  I have no idea how anyone could enjoy this book - it is terrible.  It doesn't even deserve a whole star.

B000W74EQC|5.0|I don't know what the other fellow is on about but there is nothing wrong with a special edition of Harry Potter, especially if you don't already have a copy of the Sorcerer's Stone.  There's not really much that the studio can do to this movie to change it one way or another.  If it is a two-sided single disc, so what?  I have other movies on a two-sided disc and I find it to be very convenient.  If you don't already own this movie then I suggest you buy it.  Unless you desire heavy themes and truly terrible scenes then perhaps Harry Potter is for you.  Most kids will love the show.
B000Y179KO|5.0|Absolutely great. This will not be another detailed review, just another five stars on the board. The Long Road is a polished release by accomplished veteran musician/songwriters. Well worth the 28 year wait.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|Van Helsing is a cool movie.  The detractors here seem to have one thing in common: they all like the old Dracula and Frankenstein movies from back in the 1930s.  Perhaps they prefer that the horrible natures of these two things be taken a bit more seriously.    This movie is just fine the way that it is.  There are many good special effects and the story is actually quite good.  Anyone taking the show too seriously aren't really paying attention, though.  It was clear to me from the opening scene with Mr. Hyde that Van Helsing was not going to be a serious movie.  That was fine with me.  I wouldn't mind if Hollywood tried to create a new and horrible Dracula story (they might surprise themselves if it is really good).  But, as fantasy goes this was a well done show.    The James Bond comparison seems valid but I'd like to point out that there is nothing wrong with the James Bond formula.  Why can't that work for a mild fantasy show?  It is cliche, but these days cliche is hard to escape.  Movies have gone over just about every theme and story line possible.  There's not much new ground to cover.    What makes Van Helsing so cool, though, is that the varied story elements are combined into a unique idea that presents the audience with a mild but credible story.  Dracula is determined to take over the world and only Van Helsing, under precise conditions, will be able to stop him.  There is only one way to kill Dracula.  Will Mr. Van Helsing be able to do so and yet return to himself?    This is a clever show but try not to take it too seriously and you will have some fun watching it.
B000T05R8Q|5.0|Some Floyd fans don't own PIPER. It was the Floyds first album, and ultimately it is a Syd Barrett album, more than it is a Floyd album (if you compare with other Floyd albums vs. Syd albums....) If you do not own a copy of this album, and were thinking about picking it up, well I think the only way to do it at this point would have to be to spring the extra loot and get this three disc 40th anniversary edition.<br />I lost my copy years ago, but haven't missed it too much, as I have a copy on vinyl; and that has always suited me fine. However, I recently heard the mono cut (my vinyl copy is stereo) from a friend, and my god! It's as if you re-discovered the whole album! I've noticed that this happens alot with a lot of the psychedelic albums of the late sixties... Stereo was still rather new then, and the trippy sound effects and echos were just too cool for producers to ignore. Especially when it comes to a band like Syd Barrets Pink Floyd. Granted, I love the stereo mix, but the mono mix really takes you on a different trip entirely... and I gotta say really shows Syd Barrett in more of a brilliant musician type of light, than say a tripped out head case type of light. (Anyone who has ever heard Syds solo projects will be able to attest... these recordings sound so clean! It's almost like Syd Barret sitting in your living room! And he knows exactly what he's doing!)<br />The package comes with a few other cool materials and a third disc of early singles (Still, no Vegetable Man... I'm begining to think that maybe the band wants to forget about that one?) I have all these singles on other discs, even the Intestellar Overdrive EP was available about ten years back, I'm not sure about now...<br />However, the set is worth it in my book, if you do not already own the album... and really, some of you may want to pay the thirty bucks just for the mono cut... it is pretty damned cool.<br />Right, so.. RIP SYD, and so forth.... check it out!

0385334206|5.0|The first Vonnegut book i read was Slaughterhouse-five, then Cats Cradle, and i have to say, breakfast of champions is just as good.  I read breakfast of champions in one night, the second i picked it up i could not put it down. Kurts prose is so unlike any other author, although i did find som similarities between this book and Sluaughterhouse-Five. The way he reapeats certain phrases to get them stuck in your head or just to create an overall feeling, in SH-5 it was \\"so it goes\\" diminishing the impact of death on the reader for the insight that that person is not really dead but just ina bad place at that moment. And in Breakfast of champions he often end paragraphs with \\"and so on\\" which he himself makes note of in the the book, because like the plastic material that permeates the creek in his book and life in general it just keeps going on an on and on and so on, for ever and ever and ever ECT.

B00026WUAU|5.0|Bob Dylan's Street Legal (1978) has a lot in common with his Blood On The Tracks album. No, they don't sound anything alike; one is country-folk and the other is gospel/R&B rock with a Spanish flavor. What connects the two albums is Dylan's commitment to the music as a singer, and that both albums feature the best musicians he has ever worked with. On both albums, Dylan is on his best behavior, rising to the occasion and delivering the best vocal performances of his career.<br /><br />Street Legal is a metaphor-filled, emotional, enigmatic and mystical journey of urgent and profound requests for information. My favorite song on the album is the hypnotic Senor (Tales Of Yankee Power). Starting out like an atmospheric sequel to Knockin' On Heaven's Door, it's a southwestern tale of intrigue and a one-sided conversation with \\"Senor\\". As the song progresses, it becomes apparent that Senor is God.<br /><br />Let's overturn these tables, disconnect these cables<br />This place don't make sense to me no more<br />Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Senor?<br /><br />God is also mentioned in the rockin' blues New Pony, with a sharp Dylanism.<br /><br />That God you been praying to is gonna give you back<br />What you been wishing on someone else.<br /><br />No Time To Think is a Spanish horn-filled warning of political/personal calamity.<br /><br />Lovers obey you, but they cannot sway you<br />They're not even sure you exist<br /><br />The songs weave in and out of colorful historical yarns and current personal issues that don't always seem connected. Street Legal isn't always easy to piece together, but it's always a pleasure to listen to.<br /><br />There is plenty of excellent electric guitar, Hammond B-3 organ and saxophone on the album, and nearly every song includes prominent soul-singing female background singers which creates an R&B/gospel atmosphere.<br /><br />Personally, I place Street Legal in my own \\"Bob Dylan Top Five Albums\\". It's that good, especially if you're able to adjust to the unique and interesting song arrangements. Street Legal is Bob Dylan as you've never heard him before, and it's also Bob Dylan at his very best.l is Bob Dylan as you've never heard him before, and it's also Bob Dylan at his very best.
1594489505|5.0|A heart-wrenching tale, rich in its description of characters, setting and theme. Hosseini transports his reader's into a culture and its people with such vivid precision, reader's felt as much a part of the story as the charcters he created.  At times, it is hard to fight back the tears.    Couldn't put the book down! The characters and events stay with me for days.  Worth the read. Much will be learned.
0743298039|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed \\"The Thirteenth Tale,\\" although it is certainly not a great book like the classics to which it is an homage.  It is a good, well written gothic tale with a satisfying, if somewhat forced, clunky ending.

B00006F83Y|1.0|The only reason I gave this album one star is because it doesn't allow zero or negative stars. Apparently this group thinks crappy 70's garage rock deserves revisiting. I beg to differ. This band has actually managed to be worse than the bands that spawned them. This is the bastard offspring of the worst incarnation of rock 'n roll. Retarded machismo abounds, and the lyrics bring to mind the phrase \\"retards attempting poetry.\\" I had to listen a few more times to prove it was actually as bad as I thought it was the first time. This review is actually the watered down version, as I'm not allowed to use the kind of vulgarity required on this site.
1559408855|4.0|To be honest, the only reason I got this movie in the first place was because of its reputation as being one of the most vile and disturbing movies ever made.  I read through most of the reviews on here as well as looked at some other information on the web and the general feeling I got from that material was that this movie would basically scar me for life.  By the time I got a hold of a copy I was honestly not sure if I should even watch it.  But after having it in my house for a day, my curiosity over came me and I put this bad boy in the dvd player.  And now that I've sat through the film in its entirety, I can honestly say that the violence in the film was not as nearly as disturbing or graphic as I was led to believe.  I did however find other redeeming qualities in the film.  I found that the film is actually quite artsy-fartsy, shot very beautifully, and well-acted.  It seemed to me like Salo should be a movie on the Sundance channel, rather than being reviled for its cinematic atrocities.  I think the film's violence and sex holds a back seat to the film's thematic elements, which are far more disturbing than any of the rape or killings that occur.  Sure, watching someone eat feces will always turn the stomach at least a little bit, but I've seen a lot worse in my time in other movies.  The violence in Salo isn't even nearly as bad as your average Saw or Hostel sequel, so I don't know what all the fuss was about.  The ideas and the film itself are really what give this movie any weight.  If you know anything about movies with lurid subject matter, the violence in Salo shouldn't bother you too much.  The film goes way beyond its violence and is a lot better than just having violence.  See it for what it is, not for it's hyped up disturbing qualities.

B000WGNLLW|5.0|Initially listening to this, I thought to myself, yah, I don't think I can wrap my head around this one. But then after giving it a few more tries - it grew on me. And I am now to the point where I absolutely love it, with the exception of 1 song - the instrumental - sorry Nick. But is there really a album where you LOVE, just LOVE every song on there?....other than their earlier records of course.     So the people who have put there reviews on here and said that it is just awful, I would ask you to consider giving it a few more chances. If you have a love of the boys as many of us do, they to this day will still get a hold of you in some way. Give yourself a chance to enjoy it as I did.     So.......... Andy left? Again? Big deal! The backbone that is Duran Duran still is intact and has proven their abilities to produce new music. So what if Timberland and Justin Timberlake had their hands in the pot and helped stir it up - in order to grow and change we must accept ideas, help or suggestions from others - that is simply what they have done. They stepped outside their usual selves and possibly their realm of comfortability - pushed the envelope in a different manner so to speak. And in my opinion, they took the opportunity to look at this project from a different angle....and you know what? It worked!   Enjoy it!
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Dont listen to what people say about how \\"bad\\" the album is, the thing is people cant accept change. Kelly will never make another album like Breakaway or Thankful. How boring would it be to have the same stuff over and over. Lyrically this album is a masterpiece. My December reminds me of Jagged Little Pill. The music clashes together well with the lyrics and its all so raw. There's no in between in the songs - theyre right to the point of what shes trying to say. My December is probably now one of my favorite albums of all time. Each song is relatable. They dont have to have strong hooks like Since U Been Gone - which was a formula song and the formula has been copied many more times by that producer. Shes not a puppet as Clive Davis tried to make her to be. Shes an artist with a real vision and a vision to have a lasting career and not a song by song career. Way to go Kelly on this release!

The book flows easily and the case studies are fun and thought provoking. I've read every major past lives book available and this one is still at the top. I've given this book as gifts to family and friends over the years because it was so powerful in my own life. This is a must read if you are interested in reincarnation and past lives!
B000OLGCI4|5.0|It's been just over 40 years since I saw my first Disney movie, and I still love to watch the classics.  \\"The Jungle Book\\" ranks right up there with the rest of the Disney classics as a light-hearted, humorous, and warm story that kids and adults alike can enjoy together.  Although today's animated films are very entertaining and provide wonderful humor, there is nothing like the true classics from Disney for pure entertainment filled with humor, romance, and clean fun.
0618871713|4.0|I cannot praise this graphic novel enough.  I was so impressed with way Bechdel wove her memoir together, building from one memory into the next.  At first I found some of her writing potentially pretentious, something I have seen in the writings of other memoirs where the author wants the reader to know how much they know, to be impressed with the use of precise vocubulary, and the manipulation of time to unfold a story.  Usually, these don't work because they are not used effectively so much as for effect.  Bechdel, however, has no pretense.  Vulnerable and transparent, how she tells her personal story is so powerful it breaks your heart and inspires you soul all at the same time.  Her use of the same image, with a slightly different perspective, is not merely clever but perfection.  If I could beg her to write about her relationship with her mother, I would.  But what would be the point?  Then I would want to know more about her relationships with her siblings, with her lovers, with her neighbors.  I could never have enough.  It is enough to hope for more.
B000002J1Y|5.0|Yessongs captures Yes performing live at their peak. Many of these performances are astonishing, especially given the complexity of the music. I'd rate this as one of the very finest live rock recordings of all time. As for the sound, my only complaint is that Wakeman's keyboards often seem distant and overpowered by the other instruments, a flaw in the recording but not a major one. All Yes fans and indeed, all fans of progressive rock should own this classic CD.
4789007758|5.0|This book is still the standard, the one recommended to and for Japanese students, and they let it drop out of print?  Why?  Someone please either update this book or reissue it because it is still the best book available and getting harder to find!
1419550969|2.0|I recently took the LSAT and began studying for that test using Kaplan materials but quickly noticed how absurd some of Kaplan's advice was, not to mention the fact that their made-up questions were way out in left field.   Despite Kaplan's claim that they make-up these ridiculous questions in order to over-prepare the test-taker, in reality Kaplan does this because they are too cheap to pay LSAC to use actual LSAT questions and this is the best they could do.  When I saw little improvement in my practice test scores I decided to invest in the Powerscore Bibles since they use actual LSAT questions and I immediately noticed a difference in my practice test scores and ultimately did well on the LSAT.    I've decided to take the GMAT so that I can pursue a dual JD/MBA and, since I didn't learn my lesson last time, I purchased Kaplan's GMAT 800.  The only value I got out of this book was where Kaplan would point out the most commonly tested errors of a particular section of the test.  It isn't that the questions are difficult, they aren't really, it's that they are poorly constructed and don't really resemble those written by the GMAC.    While going over GMAC's Official Guide 11, I realized that I needed help with the sentence correction questions so I bought Powerscore's Sentence Correction Bible, which was fantastic.  Fortunately, I still have Powerscore's Logical Reasoning Bible so I can use that to prepare for the Critical Reasoning section and a math degree that'll come in handy with the quant section.    This test is too important to waste your time and money on Kaplan's GMAT 800.  I'm obviously fond of Powerscore but unfortunately they don't offer a comprehensive study guide so it can get expensive...but you get what you pay for.
B00003CXS4|4.0|I bought this movie as a gift for my fiance.  We watched it together.  It was my first time and his . . . well, I don't know how many times he'd already seen it but he loves this movie.  I thought it was a lot of fun.  The way the story unfolds and the cinematography compliment one another perfectly.  You won't come away intellectually stimulated or spiritually enlightened but in the end it's a fun film to watch and one I'd enjoy watching again.
1416523359|3.0|Unlike some other reviewers, I have nothing against the writing style here. It is slow, occasionally too cute, but thoughtful, engaging, and very poignant much more of the time. It is a beautiful tale of love between spouses and siblings (parental love fares much more poorly in this portrayal - perhaps not surprising from King, who has given us other memorably monstrous parents in his stories). But really, once the reader is brought up to speed on the \\"rules\\" of the supernatural in this book, isn't it all quite predictable? I'm not one to say this often, but as far as plot goes, I had it figured out 1/3 of the way through. That's okay (Melville tells us about 20 pages into Moby-Dick that everyone on the ship's going to die), but then I'd want to see the title character learn or realize something in the remaining 400 pages, and all the revelations, right up to the end, continue to be about Scott, not Lisey. It was all rather narcissistic and pointless by the end.
0099457156|4.0|While John Grisham's work often pays only trivial attention to things like character development, plot originality, and creating a realistic protagonist with which to work, 'The Last Juror', does all of those things and it does them very, very well.<br /><br />While this work is somewhat disappointing to Grisham fans who have grown accustomed to his work being filled with detailed legal fiction, the lesser scale of it here only works to enhance the overall narrative.  Following this small town editor for decades of his own life and seeing the interaction between himself and the townspeople throughout that time shows the world how good John Grisham can be at telling a story.<br /><br />Having read all of Grisham's work prior to this book, I can easily rank it was my favorite from him.
B00005JPKE|5.0|\\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" is the second and less publicized half (along with \\"Flags of our Fathers\\") of Clint Eastwood's pair of movies about the battle for Iwo Jima near the end of World War II. Based on some actual letters from the Japanese commander on the island to his family in Tokyo, the film tells the story of the American invasion from the perspective of the Japanese troops dug in to protect part of their homeland (politically, Iwo Jima, though an almost uninhabitable rock located hundreds of miles from the mother islands, was part of the Tokyo district of Japan). The Japanese soldiers were put in the unenviable predicament of serving as a stalling tactic. Japanese high command never supported them with the intent of defeating the American invaders, just slowing them down and causing a lot of casualties, hopefully enough to cause the Americans to sue for peace. On the other side, the Americans needed the island badly as a refueling point for bombers tasked to attack the Japanese mainland.<br /><br />With a cast of actors largely unknown to American audiences (though star Ken Watanabe was in \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\"), Eastwood can focus your attention on the relationship between the commander and his men and of both to their hopeless mission. To me, Eastwood's (and the commander's) message is loud and clear to political leaders--be very careful about starting a war because wars are so difficult, painful and costly to end. Soldiers who are sent into battle to do nothing but kill and die have families and loved ones at home. Every casualty is a personal tragedy that ultimately may be not be justified by the war's outcome. Kudos to Eastwood for making the film. \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" is not light entertainment. Five stars for fans of serious and thought-provoking cinema.
B000VNMMQQ|1.0|THIS  HAS  TO  BE  THE  WORST  OF  THE  DIE  HARD  SERIES.  NO  REAL  ACTION  AND  IT  WAS  BORING.
B00003CXDV|4.0|This surprisingly fun spoof of the Star Trek culture was purely light entertainment. The star-studded, ironic (Tim Allen (voice of Buzz Lightyear) and Sigourney Weaver (from the \\"Alien\\" movies) lead the way) and burnt-out cast of the fictional sci-fi TV show \\"Galaxy Quest\\" find themselves on a real-life mission when aliens visit the earth. The hambone acting skills and vague familiarity with a spaceship set that work so well on TV help the crew save the . . . well I'll leave it to you to find out. But Star Trek fans won't be offended as there's hardly even a \\"stun\\" setting in \\"Galaxy Quest's\\" satirical ray gun. Even the seemingly over-obsessed Trekkie-types come off looking good by the end. Four stars as fun family entertainment. A star less if you're looking for anything even remotely deep--you'll be left still looking, but somehow charmed in any event.
0767817664|5.0|I  LIKED  THIS  MOVIE  ALOT.  IM  NOT  ONE  FOR  SPOFF  MOVIES BUT  THIS  WAS  GOOD.  TEENS  WOULD  LOVE  THIS  MOVIE.  GREAT  GIFT  IDEA.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|I grew up during The Next Generation (TNG) era and was not a fan of the Original Series (TOS). The stories were good but as TV is a visual medium much of the drama of the series was lost due to the distractingly poor quality of the special effects of the era.<br /><br />When I first heard of CBS's project, I was curious from a technological standpoint. Then I saw some official comparison shots and became more interested. As my HD-DVD investment grew, I found myself becoming excited about the release of these discs. When they were announced, I immediately said \\"I've got to buy these!\\"<br /><br />Now that I've watched them, I am amazed at the amount of work and care that they've put into restoring this classic show. I find myself able to watch complete episodes and not be distracted by the fact that it's 40 years old. The clean-up that was done to these 2nd generation prints (frame-by-frame removal of scratches, damage, etc) is spectacular! The new CG effects shots are top notch! I believe the producers when they state that their intent was to create visuals that truly match those which the original writers and designers would have wanted but simply could not in the 1960s. Every new effect shot adds to the enjoyment of the show and fits with the style of the production era.<br /><br />If you always found yourself uninterested in TOS for similar reasons, check this collection out! It's changed my mind completely!
B000VWOV3O|1.0|This is the review I previously wrote, deleted in a moment of weakness and apathy, and then decided to add it back here because of Mike F.'s comments supporting my opinion.... McLaughlin is one of my musical heroes. And this item is undoubtedly the most poorly presented product I've ever encountered...and I have a huge music collection. There were no fewer than 32 mistakes in the liner and back cover for this set, a list of which I sent to someone at Sony BMG. They even managed to switch the track list on the back cover for two of the albums. (There were about half that many mistakes in the liner and back cover for the companion 5-cd set for the Mahavishnu Orchestra.) There is actually no true liner notes for these sets, just extremely poorly done musician credits for each album. I haven't even bothered to listen to the discs themselves yet, since I'm a huge McLaughlin/Mahavishnu fan who already has the earlier editions of all of these records. About the only reason to buy this, imho, is if you can get it really cheap, and do not already have most of the albums. But if you buy this, be aware that a huge amount of information you read is incomplete or in error.
B00005NGZX|3.0|3 1/2    Jane Doe still may stand as the artsy hardcore group's finest work, but still does not stand as a completely great offering. Although Converge were usually miles ahead of similar bracketed bands in terms of their pure, relentless sonic pursuits of scary loud, this very diverse(for death metal standards) and cohesive disc is still offset by a certain generic originality festering in about half of Jane Doe's less realized structures. Artfully brutal and subtly intelligent enough to stand out amongst much of the guttural nonsense which clogs this scene, vocalist Jacob Bannon's terrifying voice will still only be appreciated by initiates of the pain-as-way-of-singing delivery, save a few brave aural adventurers.
B000VI70WM|5.0|I must say I am mostly a radio duran fan.  You know all the songs they play on the radio, especially the 80's catchy tunes with a beat...but i have a sister who is a dedicated Duranie!!  She bought both different versions of the CD and the CD single. So of course I have heard a lot about this CD and must say i was skeptical.  Well not anymore. I must say that i love this CD.  You can tell it is the Duran boys with an updated sound.  The first 8 songs on here are hits. The instrumental track is enjoyable....even though the cd does fade some with the last 3 songs...you will still be listening over and over again to this CD. I am!!  This i think will also gain them a new wider variety of fans from different generations...which they deserve after all this time and hard work.  New fans who will potentionally go back and listen to their older songs and get a true understanding of what this band has done and why they are still around today.  This is a multi-generational CD and it is worth the $$$$$$!!!!!!  I give it two thumbs up and say WAY TO GO to DD :)
B000V8I2QU|2.0|I was hoping all the negative reviews were somewhat overcritical of this CD, but I have to add my opinion to the negatives for this album. The songs are great, but the sound is just terrible--it sounds as if it were recorded in a tin can. Both Springsteen and Brendan O'Brien have exemplary track records, so to have something sounding this bad coming from such accomplished artists is disappointing. I love the \\"wall of sound\\" technique, but this is a poor attempt.     The first time I played this CD on the car system for my wife, she immediately commented about how bad the sound is--and I didn't give her my opinion or warn her of the sound.    Well, the deed is done; but I have a suggestion for Bruce and the record company: remix and remaster the songs and rerelease the CD. People who already own the CD could exchange it for the fixed version. Yes, it would cost a lot of money to do this--and it WON'T be done, but it SHOULD be done.     Springsteen's songs deserve better sound than this.
0765357151|2.0|I've seen the 1970's movie version called \\"The Omega Man\\" based on this story but I'd never read the original which is why I purchased this book. The story is okay... not bad. My rating is due to the fact that I assumed I was paying for a novel and instead bought a book of short stories; the first of which is \\"I Am Legend\\". There is nowhere on the cover... front, back or spine, that warns this is a collection of short stories. I rarely buy short stories. As a rule, I prefer novels and would not have bought this one had I known. Tacky way to sell books... tacky and blatantly dishonest.<br />Richard Matheson is decent author and screenwriter but this book is merely a means to use the upcoming movie to sell a handful of mediocre short stories. Appalling way to treat his fans and consumers in general.
0440238609|2.0|Philip Pullman's series is being marketed for the same young adult market as say, Rowling's Potter books [[ASIN:0545044251 Harry Potter Boxset Books 1-7]], Tolkien's Lord of the Rings [[ASIN:0345340426 J.R.R. Tolkien Boxed Set (The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings)]], Lewis' Narnia [[ASIN:0064471195 The Chronicles of Narnia Boxed Set]], or even Cooper's Dark is Rising stories [[ASIN:1416949968 The Dark Is Rising (Boxed Set): The Dark Is Rising, Greenwitch, Over Sea, Under Stone, Silver on the Tree, The Grey King]]. Why does this distress me?<br /><br />The wonderful authors listed above have at least in some degree tried to offer us heroic models, and worlds with both good and evil.  But Pullman's parent figures are traitorous and evil, his lead characters are liars and thieves, and his goal seems to be to rid the world of authority figures in lieu of some paradise provided by the young, or some such 60's weed-vision of paradise.<br /><br />Frankly, the entire series is about anti-heroes in an evil and anti-heroic universe.  But worse, Pullman is pushing his atheistic tripe in a candy form to those who have not yet learnt to read pragmatic sense into dark imaginations.<br /><br />If Pullman wants the young to understand heros and how to be one, he should paint a real picture of the world, not one that verges from black to dark grey.  His dreary imaginings were distressing to my adult mind, and I fear for the youths who read these without the developed judgement to put them back where they belong.<br /><br />If you must read this, DON'T buy it - take a page from Abby Hoffman, or check it out from your library instead.
B000UR9TQE|2.0|Save your money! It is cleaner looking and sounding.That is about as much good as I can say about it! Why didn't Jimmy Page just put some more footage together and include a show from MSG and call it Led Zeppelin DVD II? All this rubbish about copyrights and such. Just don't call it \\"song remains the same\\" and get rid of those tired fantasy sequences and let us see the band performing.I am a little disappointed in Jimmy this time and I am not alone.I am one of their biggest fans for over 32yrs. We waited a long time for new footage.I think we deserved more! Perhaps,one day,we wil get the shows uncut and void of \\"fantasy\\"!
B000MXPE74|5.0|I really really like this CD.  I have an abysmal commute and buy plenty of CDs   to keep me from succumbing to road rage.  Costello Music was an impulse buy.    I heard Flathead once when I was shopping and my daughter tracked the group down.   I hope they have a long and productive career!  I am as excited about the Fratellis  as I was about Franz Ferdinand about three years ago.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|I initially purchased this CD set to support the Komen Foundation.  However, after getting my copy I am very impressed with the amount of music that is provided at such a great price.  Imagine you normally pay $15.00 plus just for the double CD set.  To add a DVD of music video makes this and excellent value.    I agree that it is pretty much what we have purchased on other CD's, but the entire package (plus the new songs) makes this a very worthwhile purchase.  Even for someone who owns all of the other Garth CD's (and I do), I still think this is well worth the dollar.    Buy it!  Buy it Now!

0446577391|5.0|Stone Cold is Mr. Baldacci's best Camel Club novel so far.  A good story that wraps up some loose ends and hopefully sets the stage for future Club adventures.  The usual suspects are all here but by the end of the fast paced story a few have become \\"stone cold\\".  It will be interesting to see where Mr. Baldacci goes with the Camel Club from here.  Although some major players are gone, those that remain are more than able to carry on in future stories.  If not, its been a fun ride.  A fast paced dual storyline, Mr. Baldacci weaves both the past and the present into a tightly written thriller involving espionage, politics, confidence \\"stings\\", family ties, friendships, and good old hatreds.  Into this mix he interjects the meanings of honor, ethics, corruption, and revenge to build to a terrific conclusion.  Tightly written, the novel revolves around 2 completely different plots;  the elimination of evil casino owner Jerry Bagger, who Annabelle had stung badly years before and was on the run from, and the unconnected revenge for a CIA assassination plot many years before.  The Camel Club is involved in both with interesting twists and turns that tie the entire novel together.  The conclusion(s) is(are) both predictable and yet leaves one satisfied while at the same time wondering what the future holds for the surviving characters.  I hope to read about Oliver Stone/John Carr again but that will all be up to Mr.  Baldacci?    Character development was good and helped tie the dual story lines together.  All Mr. Baldacci's characters are interesting while at the same time bringing human qualities to the plot.  Good use of character interaction.  No gratuitous sex, language, or violence.  Again, this is the best Camel Club novel yet.  Highly recommended if you are keeping up with their exciting adventures.  If this is your first Camel Club book it could be a little confusing.  So be warned.
0792163710|5.0|Shane is more than a movie, it's a legend, supported by one of the finest casts of people ever assembled for one film, and directed by the master of the craft, George Stevens.  Mr. Stevens also directed such notables as \\"Giant\\" ; \\"Hud\\" and he was in a class by himself at the time.     For me, there was only one critique - a real cowboy's horse never wore a bridle such as the one worn by Shane's horse and Tory comes home remarkably clean across his saddle after having been shot dead into a large mud puddle in front of the saloon, but oh, well.  You can't have everything, and with this remarkable film, the viewer almost does, so that must be forgiven.    The story is based on fact, and a lot of that comes through starkly, harshly in spots, as intended in true artistry, muted in other places, since history always has many facets - such as the night scene in the corral between Starrett's family, Shane and Jack Wilson, the hired gun.  You feel a certain amount of empathy for the hard-bitten old rancher, Riker, as he makes his last stand against the encroachment of a new people he sees as the only - and final - threat he hasn't been able to handle thus far - people with \\"rights\\".    This is, in fact, loosely based on the true story of the Johnson County Cattle War, Johnson County, Wyoming.  The actual location of the history unfolded near Buffalo, but it was filmed in Jackson for visual effects, with the magnificent Tetons as the silent \\"supporting\\" actors in a film destined to become one of the best ever filmed.   The Johnson County War was a cold-blooded attempt by big ranchers, some headquartered out of the country, with no interest in anything other than free range without fences - to drive out homesteaders, and the method didn't matter.  The lawless action was actually supported by the Governor at that time.  Once intimidation failed, hired guns (such as Jack Wilson) were brought in from Texas and Oklahoma, killers who took money for their work.  Though modified by an excellent screen play (and a haunting, unforgettable soundtrack) to fit the story line of a good man gone bad coming full circle - trying to outdistance his past and begin anew, this cattle war is what the underlying current that powers the story is all about.    The immediate attraction between Shane and Marion, the homesteader's wife, is subtle, but electric.  The glances at the table; the scene in the wagon as they prepare to head for town; the dance; all are masterfully done with no doubt left to the viewer as to the portent, though not a word is passed.    Jack Palance as Jack Wilson is as important as the character work done by Alan Ladd for his \\"Shane.\\"   His role rounded out the story, making it not only a great film, but one of a kind, all things taken separately.  The \\"showdown\\" is poignant, gripping, sad and final for everyone, those still standing do not escape the outcome.    The last words spoken in the film by the little boy not only make chills come to your back, they will follow you forever, as will the last glimpse of Shane.    I had to write this review, though this is an old movie, for younger people who may be looking for something spectacular from out of the past - and because I have seen it over and over, like an old friend.  I hope you enjoy it and look for the special beauty between the lines as well as in the superlative filmography.
140120306X|5.0|I adore the first two volumes of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and this one did not disappoint.     Yes, it is very different than the first two volumes - since most of the story here seems to only set up parts of the Black Dossier 'additional reading' included inside, BUT I found the whole thing an amazing piece of literature.    I'll confess that I did not get a lot of the references, but if you've been reading the other League books than you should be use to obscure literary references by now, that's part of the charm and the idea of the story (how many people today even know who Alann Quartermain is?).     I've never seen the hated movie adaptation of the first comic, nor do I plan to - and if you're a fan of the movie and have never read the comics, I would not start here. This is also very much an adult comic - lots of adult situations, so don't get this for the little ones (but these comics aren't meant for kids anyway).

B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Alter Bridge's previous work, [[ASIN:B0002IU988 One Day Remains]], has become one of my favorite albums.

1594489505|5.0|1000 Splendid Suns will transport you to another world and immerse you in the lives of contemporary women living in war-torn Afghanistan. The author has a remarkable gift for storytelling, and even though the story is not pretty--in fact it's VERY upsetting--it's a tale that will keep you turning pages. I can't believe there's anything else in print--fiction or non-fiction--that illustrates the lives endured by the Afghani people in a more graphic, poignant manner.<br /><br />The recent history of Afghanistan, with a focus on the western city of Heart and then its largest city, Kabul, is played out through the eyes of two characters. Mariam is the unrecognized daughter (harami) of a rich man and his former servant, and the younger Laila, who is the much-loved daughter of educated parents. By tragic, contrived and unforgivable circumstances, their lives come together. Hardships brought on by the Soviet invasion, the Taliban takeover, and then the events after 9-11 (also a severe drought) are one aspect to the tale; however, what's most compelling is how these women were utterly degraded by men in a variety of ways--by a father, a husband, the Taliban, society at large. (This is not to say that every man in the story is a despicable character. Laila's father and best friend, Tariq, are not.)<br /><br />Overall, the story shows how the effect of 30 years of brutal conflict and upheaval have torn apart this society. It broke my heart.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens is the author of [[ASIN:1932172300 It's Not Your Mother's Bridge Club]]
B0002IU988|5.0|I liked Creed and while there is a definite similarity in their music, Alter Bridge has taken much of what great about Creed and made it their own. It is now one of my favorite albums and their sophomore album, [[ASIN:B000VKJ6VS Blackbird]], is even better. Get both!

I remember listening to the beats being crude, raw and so unique. The lyrics blew me away since all i had heard before this was \\"going from london to the bank\\" to \\" first things first kid you're messing with the worst, imma come down on you like a f*ckin curse!\\" was a huge thing at that time ( i was 13 at the time). I remember coming back home and just listening to 36 chambers on tape over and over and bugged my parents to get me the cd.     Sadly over the years, moving from country to country i lost track of that cd, and eventually grew personally with my hip hop education, but whats so good about this album is that the msg remains the same, good music doesnt have to be what people or major labels HAVE to have it be.    This album was as big an influence on me as Led Zep's [[ASIN:B000002JSR Coda]],Tool's [[ASIN:B000000993 Undertow]], Beatles [[ASIN:B000002UB3 Abbey Road]], Hendrix's[[ASIN:B000002P5Y Are You Experienced]] and the sex pistols [[ASIN:B000002KIE Never Mind the Bollocks Here's the Sex Pistols]].    i know thats going over another genre, but for me they all played this important role in my life like enter the 36 chambers.     as an adult now i can turn around and listen to it and remember good days skate parks, graffitti and sneaking off with beers and telling a PE Teacher that \\"hut one hut two hut three hut! ol dirty B**tard live and uncut!\\" is acceptable language and that he should \\"shut yo a** up!\\" if he didnt like it.     instant classic, glad i bought it again and I will push this album onto my kids (if i ever have any) and skateboarding when they are old enough to see for themselves whats good and what they like.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|Everything about this CD is fantastic,  the choice of material, the production, the performances (both the instruments and vocals).  Dana Fuchs singing \\"Oh Darling\\" and \\"Helter Skelter\\" in a Janis Joplin style is a marriage made in heaven!  Thanks to the producers for giving her that opportunity to shine.  Secret Machines happen to be one of my favorite new groups, so having them perform \\"Flying\\" \\"Blue Jay Way\\" and \\"I Am the Walrus\\" with Bono is out of this world baby!  I'm not mentioning the other vocalists because they are new to me and their names don't come to mind BUT...they are OUTSTANDING!  They breath new life into these songs (not that they need it, of course) and it is so refreshing to know that young people today have a chance to be exposed to this music in such a fresh, wonderful way.  Spread the word, these CD's need to be heard!  The Beatles are as incredible today as they were in the 60's.  They, and their music (when done right-like here) will live forever.    However, I feel there is no excuse in the marketing of this product in that the public should be  exploited in the sense of having 2 special editions.  It truly is sad (and a sign of the times).  After reading the reviews in regards to Best Buys, I returned the CD (got my money back from the store I purchased it at) and purchased the one with the two extra bonus tracks. Shame on the marketing people who thought they should hold back info (and product) from the public. \\"How do You Sleep at Night?\\"
B00005K3OT|4.0|This movie is likeable and thoughtful and fun, and obviously Johnny Depp fans will be interested in it, even though his role is small.  Judi Dench is of course marvelous, and so was Alfred Molina.  I regretted that the special features additions were a bit skimpy, but the movie is worth the purchase price.
B000LPS3B2|5.0|Ok so.... Im currently watching this actual movie and Im getting scared from the mousic alone because i know somethings just not right going on in the other room. I LOVED this movie. I really didnt have any high expectations cause well the name is totally name to me but eh.. I through it on after finnishing \\"THE EYE\\" and well its done a way better job at scaring the crap outa me. lights out and alone. The impact moments (where loud noise and ghost pops outa the damn toaster or whatever it does) have me once again the asian horror circut is far superior to any other on earth. The story was great and unpredicable and overall very damn entertaining. Buy this DVD if you get a chance to add to your collection. hell even find it used for like half the price if your skepitcal. Its a great buy and Im glad I made it.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|I have listened to MANY Blues artists over the years (because I play the Blues Harmonica) and this guy is better than any I have ever heard - yes, that includes BB, Eric, and Stevie Ray.  Kenny Wayne Shepherd rivals him on guitar but some of the licks are so soulful you'll shake your head in wonder.    I listened to the first song and thought, \\"Wow!\\", I listened to the second song and replayed it LOUDER and though, \\"Hot Damn!\\"...I listened to the third song and had to go lie down!  LOL!    This is THE best Blues album (no other style music on this puppy) that you will EVER buy.    peace,    Joe...no relation. :-)
0525950079|3.0|Others have well covered the fact that certain elements (both plot and character) are a little too reminiscent of PILLARS, one prime example being the two brothers, one good and one bad, the former falling for the eccentric girl, etc.<br /><br />The biggest problem for me, however, is more systemic and disturbing. In PILLARS, Follett did an amazing job of writing an epic story that did not come across as a pulpit for his own personal worldview. Specifically, I thought it was quite an accomplishment for an atheist to write a book about building a cathedral while keeping his own worldview out of the way.<br /><br />No such accomplishment this time around, I'm very sorry to say. Two decades later, he has decided to engage in a bit of revisionism in order to create the illusion that the moral fabric of the time was in keeping with what he thinks it SHOULD have been. The result? Some real plausibility problems. I'll be the first to admit that the Catholic church had major problems, but any open-minded research (of the kind obviously behind PILLARS) will reveal that the scenarios and characters portrayed in WORLD simply aren't credible. Common practices and beliefs regarding sexuality, in particular, are absurdly separated when it comes to reality vs. the Follett portrayal in WORLD. Quite simply, two decades after PILLARS, it's obvious that Follett decided to inject a monster dose of his own hyperliberal worldview into this latest work. A real shame.<br /><br />I still consider Follett one of the best novelists working today, and I'm sure I'll buy his next book, but it's a shame to see such a great writer decide that his personal views on faith, God, and morality, are so much more important than the creation of a believable story.
B000W4KT64|5.0|I love movie musicals, and I'm glad they're coming back.  This movie, in particular, was a frolic, and a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.      Set in Baltimore, circa 1962, this movie fast-forwards almost painlessly through the civil rights movement.  The friendships which develop between the black and white kids are sweet, in a candy-coated way, but they don't reflect the true hostility and fear which characterized that period.  Bottom line: the picture scores an A+ for spirit and and F for history, but that's OK, because it's not PBS anyhow.  If you want a civil rights documentary, go ask Ken Burns.     The music had me tapping my feet, and I absolutely loved John Travolta as Edna Turnblad.  If he doesn't get a best supporting actor (!) nomination for this part, there ain't no justice.   His \\"dancing in the laundry\\" sequence with Christopher Walken is priceless.   I am getting it for my brother for Christmas, and that's that.
B000VNMMRA|4.0|I got this version for the extended, unrated cut; I don't watch special features unless there is some specific reason, or I'm REALLY bored. I'm not sure that the extra few minutes was worth the extra money, but it did come with a digital copy on the second disc that I could copy to my computer & portable player. For me that's a nice bonus. Better hurry, though; the digital copy expires 1st December; I'm not sure what they had to gain from that.<br /><br />The movie itself was a fantastic romp for anyone who grew up with John McClane, or any 80s action TV shows. It was nice to see some real stunts and not so much CGI. I felt that the technobabble was laid on a bit thick; if I can understand even a little of it on a rudimentary level, I know that people around me are probably getting bored-- but it never gets bogged down like that Matrix sequel. Parts were probably over the top and unrealistic, but I don't watch movies for realism. I want to be taken away someplace, and Live Free or Die Hard does just that.<br /><br />Overall I have to give the four stars-- minus one for a bit too much technobabble, for the price and for the expiry date on the digital copy. It's too bad Amazon doesn't do half-stars, because I would give it 4 1/2. The points I've listed are minor, and don't merit a whole star deducted. This is a great movie that you'll definitely enjoy.
0440238609|4.0|With all the hype over Philip Pullman's \\"atheism,\\" I think it is important to note that his beef seems less with (the possibility) of a Supreme Being, than with organized religions themselves--all of which are very human, run by humans, and thus flawed.  People turn to religion to help them organize their view of the world and their place in it.  Any student of history can point to many examples of human beings doing evil in the name of their religion.  Unfortunately, it often seems that organized religion is more concerned with weeding out those who question their view of the world, and little to do with any worship of a Supreme Being--and this dichotomy seems to be what disturbs Pullman.  No faith should be shaken by questions and doubts, but should be strengthened and stretched by the constant curious questioning of the evolving human race.
B000VNMMR0|4.0|After all, don't we watch the Die Hard movies for Willis' laconic, ironic, iconic and insouciant style?  Sure, the plot is a shotgun marriage of \\"Under Siege 2: Dark Territory\\" and \\"Enemy of the State\\" but it doesn't really matter because Willis is there taking on the bad guys, giving us his deadpan, his sneers, his wisecracks, and great action as he once again saves the day.  New York, L.A. and New Jersey are lucky to have him as a cop!
B00012QM86|5.0|Every once in a while, a movie does more than simply entertain. This movie moves you, make you think, makes you want to take action, and most importantly, perhaps, it leaves an imprint on your life. Schindler's List is one of these movies. It does all of the previously described and so much more.    Schindler's List is about a rather selfish and greedy businessman named Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson). His only concern is making money, and if he happens to help people while doing it, so be it. However, he begins to become almost obsessed with the idea of saving these people after seeing the horrors incurred on them from the grip of Hitler and especially the psychopathic Amon Goeth (Ralph Finnes).    This movie is powerful in its writing and its storytelling. To see Schindler transform into this man who begins to use his absolute genius in business to save lives stirs up emotion in the viewer. To see Goeth's insanity allowed to manifest itself in his concentration camp sends shivers up the spine and feelings of disgust rise up.   Schindler's List even raises questions about politics and shows what happens if politics goes awry--mass chaos. One cannot help but want to yell out in some extremely tense and dramatically ironic scenes in the movie, which shows it's genius by stirring up the viewer.    The movie is also a work of art. Using every possible artistic direction, the movie is even just simply beautiful to watch. It is shot entirely in black and white (except for one little girl's red coat) which simply adds to the setting of the movie. Lighting is used multiple times to help create mood. Camera angles are always different and help to cause emotion to, again, coming pouring out of the movie.    The only negative I have about this movie is that you probably won't be able to do much afterwards due to the emotional drain you will experience.    I cannot recommend this movie highly enough.
0792165020|2.0|Two stars only for the perfect pitch casting.  Because space is limited, let me just toss out the most egregious elements of the movie:<br /><br />* God this movie was long;<br /><br />* no Americans except people who think movies are art (these are the people who drink espresso and hold the semi demitasse cups with a thumb and index finger) care to see a movie about class tensions;<br /><br />* the protagonist should not be markedly stupider than the audience.  Anyone who wasn't yelling \\"Get the hell out of Rome\\" after Tom runs into Meredith is probably dumb enough to think this is a great movie;<br /><br />* Exactly why should the movie end after Tom's third murder, as opposed to the second, or even the first? There's no rhyme or reason to that particular place to end the movie.
0345910907|5.0|This is a wonderfully readable and engrossing book on the period that marked us more deeply - as the source of so many of our touchstone images and ideas - than just about any other.  We, or at least I, imagine dungeons, cold, early death, blind faith, and the knightly order of repression and the search for glory.  Tuchman questions these stereotypes and myths by holding them to intelligent scrutiny.<br /><br />Tuchman chose 14C, when the feudal order was at last breaking down, after nearly 500 years of relative stability as a politico-economic system, if tumultuous in terms of conquest and war.  I have wanted for years to find an account of this second dark ages, when the fabulous expansion of the Gothic era ended in plague, famine, war, and the beginnings of popular revolt.  Tuchman chooses an aristocrat, Coucy, as the vehicle for this story, and the choice is a perfect fit.  She also follows the great writers of the time, including Chaucer and Petrarch, in fascinating detail.<br /><br />Coucy was the embodiment of the late Chivalric ideal:  rich, prudent, decidedly less cruel than his forebears, militarily brilliant and a fine diplomat.  Rather than rush into military engagement with relish and rashness as his contemporaries tended to do for glory, he actually analyzed the situation and chose his moment. He leads an exemplary life of service, though dies in shame as a prisoner in the hands of the Turks and without an heir.  It is an incredible life, though we get to know little of his character and personal thoughts due to gaps in the documentary record.<br /><br />The age that Tuchman portrays is one in which everything that could have gone wrong, did.  The plague kills up to 50% of the European population in several waves, which loosed the peasants from the land as labor costs rose with higher demand.  A terrible war (of \\"100 years\\") began in France, devastating large portions of it by very unknightly pillage and simple havoc.  The Catholic church suffers its first schism, which divides societies and plays out - destroying its image of unity - in the first great political-military disasters that get far far worse in the Reformation.  Finally, the Turks are approaching and take Constantinople, after a series of victories that frightened the West with a new style of warfare.  No wonder people felt the apocalypse was approaching.<br /><br />Most interestingly, the feudal system is under such stress that it is on the verge of collapse.  Not only are knights proving incapable of facing up to growing popular rebellions with several shocking military defeats (e.g. William Tell in Switzerland), but their technology of warfare was in decline with the use of longbows (by British yeoman) and far more maneuverable lighter arms and professional standing armies (the Turks).  With the end of their monopoly of force, the entire political system of landed aristocracy with limited loyalty to a central kingly authority was clearly on the way out - mercenaries and even nationalist armies are on the horizon.  War is no longer an affair restrained by rule and knightly custom, where the captured expect to be held for ransom comfortably and perhaps for years, but is evolving into far more brutal confrontations with mass executions.<br /><br />Tuchman explains these developments with lightning clarity, in dense paragraph after paragraph.  The reader gains wonderful insight into the forces that shaped the period.  For example, I never had understood the chain of reasoning that went behind certain theological disputes, such as the \\"transubstantiation\\" of the body of christ in the wine and wafer of mass.  If it wasn't true godhead, she explains, then the authority of the church (leading directly to the pope) would be undermined.  Thus, it was defended with extreme violence.  What I so love about popular historians is that, in contrast to many academics, they understand that this needs a brief explanation.<br /><br />Tuchman is brilliant at showing the period as a nexus, a watershed in which one order is giving way to another.  She never assumes, however, inevitability and always brings a depth of understanding that never appears superficial, at least to me.  That makes this a masterpiece on a crucial period, in my view.  Her descriptions are poetic in their vividness.  Interestingly, this is about the same period covered by Huizinga in Autumn of the Middle Ages, but brought to palpable life with the story of Coucy.<br /><br />Highest recommendation.order is giving way to another.

0972169504|5.0|I rated this book with five stars... because for me, it deserves them. You will laught really hard, almost to the point of tears... if you have a PhD, have attempted to get one, or you are in the process of getting it.<br /><br />Humor is regularly very dependent on our backgrounds, and although there are quite some of the strips who will make everybody laught their socks off, to most people, most of the strips will make little or no sense at all.<br /><br />Now, if you are a grad student... I really recomend it, it will make you feel less misserable! ;P
B000VNMMWA|5.0|I rarely rebuy dvds for the special editions, only once in a while when it's a film I appreciate. This is one of those films. Plethora of more special features make this a great set, the various commentaries alone make this Peter Jackson/LOTResqe. Hope they give the same treatment to Shaun Of The Dead soon!
B0007KTAU4|4.0|I had never heard about Carla Bruni before I saw the movie \\"Conversation with other women\\", where they play the song giving the name to this disc, but I liked it. I three of the other reviews (as they were kind of low in my opinion), and although I must say some of their arguments seemed correct, I don't see how bad it is.<br /><br />They are right in the sence that it's very uniform, meaning, the rythms change very little from one song to the next, and it's probably not the most original work I have heard. But on the other hand, it's really different from what I hear most of the time, it's refreshing, and I really liked her voice.<br /><br />I tend to rate, in my opinion, a bit hard. I would give it four and a half stars if I could. I generally rate with 5 only those things that I consider really magistral, so, I wouldn't rate this with 5, but in my opinion, it's good, really worth the price.
0743298039|4.0|Warning:  Possible spoilers in this review:<br /><br />Set in a Gothic mansion perfect for Jane and Mr Rochester, this is a mysterious fairy tale/ghost story for those who are intrigued by classic gothic lit and stories about stories.  If you loved Carlos Ruiz Zafon's The Shadow of the Wind, this is a perfect recommendation. Mysterious servants, unexplained ghosts, a twisted tale of possible incest, insanity,and suicide, this sad tale has it all!<br /><br />Vida Winter, the most popular British fiction writer of her time is ill and has called on a somewhat erudite and sheltered scholar to write her biography.  Not being well acquainted with Winter's works, Marageret Lea immerses herself in Winter's novels before going to her home in the moors to meet her and is completely besotted with Winter's books, like the rest of the nation.  She is also intrigued.  She becomes involved in a very real way in the mystery that is Vida Winter.<br /><br />With tons of allusions to many classics (Jane Eyre, The Lady in White etc.), yet written in a modern voice, this book will satisfy the most jaded reader.<br /><br />The only reason why I can't give it 5 stars is becasue I cannot imagine picking it up again to re-read anytime soon.  A wonderful first novel,  look forward to future works from Ms. Setterfield.
B000BNI90O|5.0|This was an amazing purchase.  However, the only bad thing i can say about it is that it the amazon track listing says disc 3 has 16 tracks but it only has 9.  I was hoping that the music used in the entire end credits would be included, however it was not.  But other than that, Amazing!!!!
B000UR9TQO|3.0|For those of you who may be wondering, this set DOES NOT come with the soundtrack CD.  That was the only reason I popped for the collector's edition over the regular package.    As others have said, the t-shirt is more of a medium than an XL.  I was also disappointed to discover that the new songs are on the bonus disc, not integrated into the main film.  At the end of the day, it's Zeppelin and it looks and sounds great, but the exclusion of the soundtrack CD makes for a bit of false advertising.  Buyer beware.
B000UR9TRS|5.0|They played the movie in the theatre near my house tonite. As another poster indicated, it seems that the true QUAD was missing. There was some right-to-left bouncing going on in specific places, but it was NOT quadraphonic. I'm just a shade too young to have seen the original release, but this was awesome. It was the first time i'd seen the film in 15 years. The last time i watched it i was at a friends house. We had the tape. We got there at about noon, played it over and over till about 3am when we all were too drunk to press rewind again!    If you like Zeppelin, this is for you! It's Zep at their finest. Best film this year, bar-none.
0061544493|5.0|I read this book while recuperating from surgery and I have to say it was perfect for taking my mind off my health issues. It's surprising. I didn't expect Victoria Beckham to come off as fun and likeable as she does. Now to the point of the book: Does it offer good fashion advice? Yeah, it does. She's spot on when she disses the kitten heel shoe. Unless you are built like Audrey Hepburn (I'm not)it doesn't do your legs any favors. She's excellent in the makeup chapter and even though I don't wear jeans her jeans chapter contained everything you need to know. I wish everyone would read it before buying a pair. It would cut down on a lot of public ugliness.     The chapter on getting ready for a party was excellent and timely for this season. I liked the chapter on maternity dressing and appreciated the chapter on how to wear hair extensions.     Overall this book made me happy and I plan to keep it and refer to it for years to come.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|My 15 year old daughter and I adore the Barbie Doll packaging and the photo filled episode guide, along with the cute Gilmorisms handbook. This is such a sparkling and youthful series that we both love!    As soon as it arrived in the mail, we treated ourselves to a marathon of episodes, beginning with the pilot that we'd never seen.    There aren't many shows as endearing and witty. It's a keeper and definitely a not-to-miss DVD set for mother-daughter bonding.    It's especially suited for those popcorn and soda slumber party Saturday nights.  Moms and daughters, don't miss out!!!
B000NVIXFK|5.0|If you're a fan or are even a semi-fan this album will amaze you with layers of sound, lyrics and power that today's bands merely tremble at.<br /><br />Why it's not in Amazon's top 100, I have no idea. If you're a true RUSH fan you don't care and you probably even take pride in the fact. Most people's music tastes are all in their mouths, not in their ears.<br /><br />Savor it.
B00008PC2O|5.0|As some of our more avid fans have noticed, Sid the Elf is branching his reviews out to reach a more diverse sampling of film. We have found that Sci-fi is quite enjoyable eventhough most of the genre's fans are complete losers who live in their mothers' basements, weigh at least two-and-a-half bills, and have multiple computers(one of which is loaded and overrun with viruses if you get the drift. When you think Sci-fi, one of the films that pops to mind is T2. In the 90's it was the big budget action movie, starring The Immortal Arnold Schwarzenegger and written by James Cameron.  Yeah, the same dude who did Titanic. If you could get inside info on things like \\"Did Arnold threaten Cameron's life on-set, or did he just call him an emasculating name?\\" wouldn't that make a better feature on the DVD than \\"Oh, so that's how they made that dude appear right out of the floor? That's pretty cool.\\" Oh, boy!<br /><br />But, this movie was totally awesome. You had many soundboard lines to laugh at just because of The Arnold Voice. You had tons of cool explosions. You had a lot of sweet guns and explosives. You got to make fun of Sarah Connor because she was absolutely nuts. Pretty much everything you would want in a great guy movie, except for hot chicks. Oh well, you can't have everything. The concept was sweet. You had Arnold who was a now obselete Terminator, if there even is such a thing, assigned to protect John Connor. However, John and his mother, Sarah Connor, are being hunted by another, updated Terminator. Now, Arnold was made out of metal, so he could be crushed or something. But, this other dude was made out of liquid or something. So if you shot him, this giant hole would open up then start to close immediately. Awesome! How is Arnold going to take this thing on?<br /><br />Because he's Arnold. That's why. If you learn anything reading Sid's reviews, learn this: Arnold is the man. He is undefeatable and undeniable. We wish he could be president. So, on Sid the Elf's recomendation, watch Terminator 2. You will absolutely love it.n, watch Terminator 2. You will absolutely love it.
0440238609|5.0|As a teenager I enjoyed reading the 'Lord of the Rings', 'Narnia' and a few years later, well outside my childhood years, I did derive significant pleasure from the Harry Potter series. As an adult though, these novels register as good works of fantasy well worth their entertainment value but it stops there. (Although I still envy the young mind that opens the Lord of the Rings for the first time). Philip Pullman's trilogy 'His Dark Materials' plays in a different league altogether. A child will enjoy it for the adventure and breathtaking storytelling. An adult will find the retelling of the \\"Felix Culpa\\", with a twist, very titillating and the penmanship mesmerizing. This work truly ranks with the likes of Selma Lagerlof's (1909 Nobel literature Prize winner) 'Gosta Berling Saga'. A true Masterpiece for all ages. Already showered with numerous awards, the best indicator of  the excellence of this work is in the passionate debate it generates.
B000Y179KO|5.0|I'm afraid that I'm the type of person who has a tendency to only buy \\"greatest hits\\" type albums.  I usually have to force myself to listen to new songs by anybody and, once I've gotten used to it (and have learned enough of the words to sing along), then I'll give in a buy the CD.  But with this CD, I thought, \\"How hard can it be to 'get used to' songs by the group who sang songs like \\"Desparado\\" and the like?  So I got the Long Road CD and reluctantly put it in my CD player.  I was amazed by almost EVERY song and immediately fell in love with \\"What Do I Do With My Heart.\\"  I've called all my friends who appreciate this type of music and told them to head straight for Walmart and get a copy of this CD ('cause they're not gettin' mine!!).
B000WQ9UA8|1.0|ok. this is her better album...however, anyone could be the singer. this is a producer's album and not a singer's. of course, with britney the term \\"singer\\" is used very loosely. this is a typical cut-and-paste cd.     when i think of britney i think of mcdonald's...yeah yeah yeah, they have sold billions of burgers...but quantity doe snot mean quality.
B00006LHYC|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF HER GREATEST ALBUMS YET... IT HAS HELPED ME IN SO MANY WAYS. SHE/IT HAS TORN DOWN MY WALLS AND BROKE ME DOWN.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|A total fantasy, of course. Rats don't cook, and given a preference, they would eat all their food raw. But putting that aside, this movie does make a good point about prejudice.  Much of what we think we know about rats is based upon stereotypes.  Rats are seen as dirty, vicious, disease carrying monsters.   Actually, wild rats are only dirty because we(and our beloved cats) force them to hide in filthy places.    Real rats are not vicious. they are timid and will avoid contact with us at every chance.  Only when they are trapped and in immediate danger of being killed will they defend themselves with the only weapon they have, their teeth. In any fight between a human and a rat that I have ever known there have only been two possible outcomes. first, and most often, the rat is killed, second, the rat evades the human and runs away at the first opportunity.    In the case of disease, the fact is that the diseases that rats carry are just as lethal to the rats as they are to us.  In fact, squirrels carry the same diseases and we feed those little beggars thousands of dollars worth of  corn and peanuts every month and try to persuade them to come up and take the treats out of our bare hands.  I have had friends who breed rats, and those that I have had a chance to handle were clean, friendly, and kind of cute. I do not keep them myself because of the work required to keep their cages cleaned. This is, I might mention, is the same amount required to keep a hamster or parrot cage clean.  But, disregarding the dull world of facts, This movie is a delightful, rambling romp through an imaginary world where men can be  manipulated like puppets by pulling on their hair, people can be subdued or even killed using only one thumb, where pictures in books can come out and give deeply moving advice, rats can cook better than experienced chefs, and rats can be served in special dining rooms on the terrace of Parisian restaurants.  This movie has something for everyone who can suspend their disbelief for a few hours.  Its Disney at its best and Pixar at its most ingenious.  Sit yourself down for a couple hours of fantastic, wonderful, and not so serious, fun.  (By the way, I looked up the recipe for Ratatouille. Its a stew or casserole made from sliced eggplant, sliced zucchini,and sliced green peppers topped with parmesan cheese. The word itself means shake-and-stir, Ratata is french for shake and tatouille means stir.  Google the recipe and serve it to your family after the movie.)
B000002OMN|4.0|Given that a sequel to the original [[ASIN:B000056VJ7 Bat out of Hell]] took Meat Loaf and Jim Steinman some 15 years to make, it is amazing just how close to the blueprint part two holds. Not like both parties had not tried and missed before. There was Meat Loaf's BooH follow-up, [[ASIN:B0000025GD Dead Ringer]], in which our hero had lost his voice and Todd Rundgren's sympathetic production. Then there was what was supposed to be Meat's follow-up until Steinman hijacked it as a solo LP, [[ASIN:B0000025IQ Bad for Good]], where it was made terribly obvious why such a gifted songwriter as Steinman needed the dramatic vocals of Meat.<br /><br />Very telling is that, 12 years on, Steinman and Meat resurrected 4 of \\"Bad for Good's\\" songs for \\"BooH2.\\" While Meat had some success without Steinman, hearing these re-recorded songs shows just how much they need each other to both achieve optimum performance. That is what they got on \\"Bat out of Hell II.\\" Meat brings on the drama while Steinman pours on the Broadway. Steinman had already carved out his space as a producer of melodramatic adult contemporary hits (Barbra Streisand, Barry Manilow, Air Supply, Bonnie Tyler, etc), while Meat was still huge in Europe and fondly remembered stateside for \\"Bat out of Hell\\" the first. Given that this was the duo's first collaboration in the CD era, it also meant that they could let there excesses run unchecked. That first hit, \\"I Would Do Anything For Love\\" clocked in on the album at twelve minutes, and another hit, \\"Objects in the Rear View Mirror May Appear Closer Than They Are\\" hit ten.<br /><br />They marketed it as an event and succeeded by giving a nostalgic audience exactly what they came for. Loud rock with operatic Springsteen overtones? Check. Huge wall of sound ballads? Check and double check, Hokey teenage melodrama? Mega-check, especially the playlet \\"Love and Death and an American Guitar\\" from \\"Bad For Good\\" (here as the introduction to \\"Wasted Youth\\"). As Meat intoned 15 years before on \\"You Took The Words Out of My Mouth,\\" the wolf appeared with the red roses, and America offered up a collective throat. The album and the single went to number one (something the original never managed) and it bought Meat Loaf a permanent place on the rock scene.<br /><br />But does it still hold up? The answer is yes. For all the trickery and bombast, \\"Life is a Lemon and I Want My Money Back\\" still rages hard. \\"Wasted Youth\\" can make you pump a fist a time or two, and \\"I Would Do Anything for Love\\" stands as one of Steinman's best mini-operas. That is not to say a few checks on the excess would not have been prudent; \\"Out of The Frying Pan\\" is filler, and the stagy instrumental \\"Back Into Hell\\" is unnecessary. Nevertheless, \\"Bat Out Of Hell II\\" is a worthy successor to its namesake, and for memorable than most of Meat's output between these bookends. Get Bats one and two (and skip three), and you've got the essential Meat Loaf.\\"You Took The Words Out of My Mouth,\\" the wolf appeared with the red roses, and America offered up a collective throat. The album and the single went to number one (something the original never managed) and it bought Meat Loaf a permanent place on the rock scene.     But does it still hold up? The answer is yes. For all the trickery and bombast, \\"Life is a Lemon and I Want My Money Back\\" still rages hard. \\"Wasted Youth\\" can make you pump a fist a time or two, and \\"I Would Do Anything for Love\\" stands as one of Steinman's best mini-operas.

B000NDIAWY|3.0|I bought this CD because I really liked Brandi Carlile's single, The Story.    That song is still great, but none of the other songs particularly impressed me. They weren't bad, but not my favorite. Her style is a mix of pop/rock and country, so if you are a fan of country music you may like it more. It was little too country for me.
B00005JM0B|4.0|One day I was at a friends house for the night, we decided to watch a movie, we were going to watch \\"Meet the Robinsons\\" for the sake of the younger kids there. My friends dad also decided to go and T3, they are both fans of the first two. After I had seen multiple negative reviews on this film I didn't expect to much, but once I heard it compares to \\"Jurassic Park III\\" (which I greatly enjoyed) I decided I might like the film. After finishing \\"Meet the Robinsons\\" the younger kids were put to bed and we started watching T3, hopefully to enjoy it, and enjoy it I did. I personally enjoyed the films action sequences and story, which I felt was intense and carried out fairly well. My friend and his dad also enjoyed the film, they agreed it didn't match the first two but that it was still a good film. This being the first \\"Terminator\\" movie I had seen I didn't know what to expect, I believed this helped me. Too many people compared this to the first two films and excpected it to be the same, but it wasn't, it was actually a fairly good film, just not quite as good as (apparently) the first two fantastic films. Because I had not seen the other two, I was able to see this one as a film and not just a stack up to the first two, thus I honestly believe it was a fairly good film. The female Terminator (T-1000) was a truly terrifying and brutal machine, the girl scared me half to death! You had know idea where she was gonna jump out from, and the fact that she brutally killed people, each in various different ways (a.k.a, punching her arm through them, killing them with buzzsaws, or just plain out shooting them) was a truly scary concept that was carried out fairly well. The acting itself wasn't a perfect gem, but it carried the story like it needed to and there was no particular flaw in the acting.    7.5/10  Very Good action film, see it.    NOTE: After rewatching the film, it came to my attention that Kristanna Loken's acting culd have been much, much better, it just felt abit corny. It didn't have the natural coldness that it should have had, it seemed to be a actress 'trying' to look cold. It could have worked better, didn't wreck the movie, but didn't give anything to it either.    NOTE 2: After seeing the first two films, I can see why some fans where a bit dissappointed. Though a do beleive they over-reacted a very good bit, I will agree it lacked the depth and a feeling that compelled you that were present in at least the second film.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|\\"Babel\\" wasn't easy to watch.  The objective wasn't to entertain.  Early on, one member of my family left the room because the reality was so intense.  I was fascinated because the patina and shine surrounding most commercially ambitious films was missing from \\"Babel.\\"  I am drawn to the reality of movies like this, in the same sort of way I begin watching TV by starting at the top of the cable channels and working my way down to the networks.  These days the networks feel overly contrived and fake, which is why they are usually my last choice.<br /><br />\\"Babel\\" was about alot of things, and it was certainly thought provoking on many levels.  Of all the themes worthy of discussion, I'm left thinking about the fragility of my modern, sheltered, western existance.  The main characters in this movie are all just a random moment and a little bad luck and/or bad judgement away from total disaster.<br /><br />I agree with most of the previous reviewers who found beauty in the directing, acting, camera work, and audio.  Even the extras, such as the tourists on the bus whose growing fear is palpable, added to many dramatic moments.  Most important, I think the movie was able to put us as nearly as possible (while sitting on my couch in the safety of my home) into the experiences of the main characters. Particularly memorable were the scenes with the brilliant young actress playing the deaf/mute.  The sound came and went, the camera shook back and forth in dramatic anxiety, and the visual stimulation was overwhelming, as if we were experiencing what the young woman was experiencing.  I understood the dreadful lonliness she was feeling while surrounded by hundreds of people in the club and on the streets of Tokyo.<br /><br />Now, several days after seeing \\"Babel,\\" I continue to contemplate the roles played by the various human beings who come in contact with the main characters in each of the three primary sub-plots.  These entirely random intersections have a huge impact on what unfolds. First the unwitting antagonists: the stupid boys with the gun, the ugly men on the bus, the moron at the border station, the drunken nephew, the dentist, and the insensitive, distant father.  These people cause the main characters to loose their footing and fall into peril.<br /><br />Next, the miraculous strangers, who, when all appears to be lost, kindly (heroically?) step between the main characters and death.  The two best examples were the Moroccan bus driver who invites the critically injured woman and her husband into his house while finding a doctor and a phone, and the police lieutenant, who somehow finds a way to be tender and understanding, probably preventing another suicide.<br /><br />Finally, I'm left thinking about what desperation will do to people and how we respond.  The babysitter went to great lengths after a series of bad decisions, to endure the desert to protect the kids.  Moments after their petty despute where the couple ably demonstrates their indifference for each other, the husband does everything he can to save his wife.  She cries - not when the pain gets too intense, but when he tells her he loves her.  And finally the young woman who exposes and denudes herself, in a desperate attempt for a response of any kind from a world in which she finds herself completely alone.<br /><br />I appreciate movies like this where the objective is to create art and tell a story as honestly as possible, where doing so the best way you know how, will inevitably preclude commercial success.the unwitting antagonists: the stupid boys with the gun, the ugly men on the bus, the moron at the border station, the drunken nephew, the dentist, and the insensitive, distant father.

B00006G8K0|4.0|This movie has an excellent cast of background characters, but in the end it is totally dominated by Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing.<br />Hammer films had a wonderful stable of outstanding \\"character\\" actors and Dracula films from the days of Bela Lugosi have always given ample opportunity for these people to strut their stuff in between the action scenes, but all these parts, in this movie, simply worked as backdrop to the main line, which is the duel to the (final)death between Dracula and Van helsing. It is interesting to note that Cushing and Lee seldom appear on the screen together until the final scene, but the whole movie plot consists of Van Helsing tracking down and ultimately destroying Dracula.<br />To Bram Stokers readers, the film, like all movie versions, is flawed.  Hammer films made very little attempt to follow the story as told in the book, many characters were totally deleted, and the setting was moved from England to Germany.  The divergances were so many that to set them all down  would require a book nearly as long as the original novel.<br />But, by itself, the movie stands up as a fast moving, well scripted, beautifully designed and well photographed yarn.  Enjoy it for itself and read the book as an entirely diffrerent story about an entirely different group of people who only shared a few names in common with the people in the movie.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|I am a huge fan of Linkin Park. One of my top 3 bands of alltime. Their first two albums were great, I think Hybrid Theory was their best but, i but i bought this album the day it came out on my way to work from Wal-Mart. After listening to the album, skipping some songs in the process, i made my decision. The album sucked....bad. I know that it takes a few listenings to get used to the songs and start really liking them, but i can honestly say, after repeatedly listening to it, this is a very good album. i still think they could have done better, especially with songs like \\"Hands Held High\\" and \\"In Between\\", i also would have liked to have heard Wake extended with some lyrics. But despite all that, i listen to this album everyday at work and at home. I don't think a mastermind band like Linkin Park should ahve changed their style so drastically, but this album is actually one of my favorites. I really don't understand what people have against so-called \\"ballads\\" just because there is no screaming or aggressive lyrics. After all, look at Alice In Chains and Staind which are also in my top 3. Alice In Chains wrote a few \\"ballads\\" if you will, and they were awesome and Layne Staley had  one of the best voices of all time. \\"THE BEST\\" in my opinion. But i have heard so many people dog this album, which i even did at first, but few people have given credit to chester's voice. This new style was able to show everyone how good and extremely great Chester's voice is. He is actually singing and not so much screaming. There's not very many people who can do both night in and nightout and sound incredible. Its a wonder how he hasn't lost his voice. but i think the change in style was a great opportunity to show how verstaile the group was. Besides, people always complain about how bands basically make the same music because the style never changes, but when they do, they get dogged for it. This is not a Great album and by far not their best, but i think its is their most versatile and is still a good album that i'm glad i bought.tile and is still a good album that i'm glad i bought.
B000QFCD5O|1.0|I've always been more a fan of the bands that preceded this \\"supergroup\\" and have kind of laughed at the joke Asia became over the years as Geoff Downes alone kept the flame burning. I was curious when I saw the original lineup had reunited, so I checked this out (thankfully, only by listening to the samples... but I think that was enough).    It seemed like a cool idea that they did some of the hits from the other bands each member had been in (even if that had to mean including a Buggles track), but when I listened to them... *sigh*...    \\"Roundabout\\" is painfully slow, and \\"Court of the Crimson King\\" proves what I've thought all along: Carl Palmer just isn't really that good of a drummer. These tracks are plodding and sloppy, mostly due to the drumming, but overall the band just doesn't really seem to gel.  I listened to a few of the other clips, but that only reinforced my initial assessment, along with reminding me that Asia's original material is nowhere on par with Yes, King Crimson, or even ELP's excessive bombast.    It's been kind of fun watching these old bands reunite in the '90s and '00s to stoke our nostalgia and occasionally produce something new and interesting. But this isn't it.

B000WQ9UA8|3.0|I would say Britney peaked with her third album, which I would give 5 stars. The first one was okay, the second one good, the third great, the fourth good, and this, fifth, is back at \\"okay.\\"    This record has nothing to do with the catchy melodies of the first record, though. It's more full of monotone chanting and guest appearances. The orchestration is thinner and whinier than previous records.    This record goes into rotation on the iPod, but not on any favorites list.

B00004UEDQ|5.0|Moving story about not only a woman who gets thrown into rehab, but also who has repressed her feelings, her life and finds herself maturing into an adult after drinking her younger life away. When she first gets into rehab, it's not only a typical scene that one might see in a rehab facility, but also one where, since the stunting of her emotional, responsible and relationship senses are that of a young, out of control child who raised herself. Through the movie, she learns how to be alive, how to be sensitive, that the man she thought was so great for her isn't at all and why, and she gets the beginnings of how to grow, get in touch with not only her feelings, but learns what is not good for her and to walk away. She learns to ask for help from those who are healthy and to walk from those who are not, slowly, and through a process that we can only wish some people would get, yet without the tragedy (although that's how some people must learn it, as for some they simply don't see it until they really hurt someone (or even kills them in some people's lives.)<br /><br />This isn't only a good story for alcoholics or drug addicts, but also one for those who haven't grown up as adults for whatever reason. To learn that people make mistakes, to learn that human touch and feelings are really what life is about, not the girl or guy with the nice suit or those who are trying to make an appearance of having money, \\"friends\\", or the potential of the mansion on the hill, the so-called \\"Glamorous life.\\" She grows to see through all the BS and get real with herself, get in touch with her feelings, realize that being able to be vulnerable is the best gift she can not only give to herself, but also to those around her, and she learns not only how to be a friend to others, but how to recognize who her friends really are.<br /><br />Great flick they outta show and discuss in high schools and colleges (although there are some parts that are graphic - drug use, etc., but then if we are real about it, most kids are seeing this stuff to one degree or another anyhow!)<br /><br />The lessons in this movie come SO late in life for some people, and for some not at all, living lives that are akward, fake, idealized, but then these people never really are happy on the inside, nor do they know how to really connect with other people. An awesome gift for someone who needs to grow before they can really feel what it is to have a family relationship, a true friend, a real life and be happy with who they really are (weather they hide in anxiety, drugs, alcohol, self-indulgence, or whatever it is that keeps them from being who they really are and not trying to put on a mask to feel OK or better than others.

0375507256|5.0|Although the mechanism used to break the stories up seems a little contrived at times, I think Mitchell pulls it off. He (in the form of Frobisher) even admits at one point that he isn't sure it is going to work, and that only time will tell. This book could have been published as a collection of short stories, and it would have been good, but by splitting the stories in half and telling them in ascending/descending order, the theme of the stories is strengthened. And I love the way that Mitchell suggests who his influences are for certain tales.
B000HVHM5S|5.0|An utterly amazing film that critics have tried to dismiss. It paints the picture of a destopic future where governments use spin, fear and attacks on its own people to fulfill their own political ambitions.    You only have to look around you at the state of the world today to see that Yes in fact, this is what is happening now.    You'll be shouting BS at the endless spin the media spew out to convince us to send our sons to their deaths in eternal wars against an enemy that has never actually been proven to exist.    A superb complimentary read is by Andrew M. Lobaczewski, Political Ponerology: A science on the nature of evil adjusted for political purposes    Don't let this movie just wash over you as harmless entertainment, the message is clear if you wake up to what governments are really about. Do they really have our best interests at heart?  the answer is No.    V for vendetta beautifully illustrates through the character portrayed by Portman, how inner strength and integrity is an intimidating weapon. A must see movie.

This Bluray is one of the best high def I have seen. The aspect ratio rocks! I think it should be made obligatory to transfer all blurays in this aspect ratio and the sound is well, awesome.<br /><br />Positive side of PQ: I could notice for the first time that when hellboy clicks the gun, the 'green' bullet can be seen in the nozzle!<br /><br />Negative side of PQ: The picture quality is so good that one can deduce that red paint was used to represent blood!<br /><br />The movie: 10/10.

B000ICL3KG|1.0|You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you can not fool all of the people all of the time.\\" -<br />  --  Abraham Lincoln<br />But You CAN  fool enough of the people enough of the time. And Al Gore's Unconvenient Truth is a perfect example of this.<br />1,500 years ago science was set back a thousand years when religion outlawed scientific knowledge and in today's world scientific knowledge is being set back again by politicians like Al Gore. If a scientist goes along with the global warming hoax his career and government grants will sour and become rich and famous but don't go along with it and their  careers will be destroyed and their funding for their work well be cut off. In addition the real experts in the field are too busy doing their 24/7 job to debunk Al Gore's political scare tactics used in Inconvenient Truth.<br />  His film is 90% smoke and mirrors and 10%  misrepresentation of scientific data. He starts out showing pictures from space of earth with long dialogues depicting himself as some kind of representative of science with many scientist friends he allegedly has known since childhood. A side view of earth showing the thin layer of the atmosphere is suppose to make people think that it is a fragile thin layer we can destroy easily. but if we were to look at a close up view we would see a 65 mile high layer composed of the troposphere, Stratosphere, mesosphere and thermosphere. On the other hand its human  life that are a thin two-dimensional  layer on the earths's surface only covering 29% of the earths surface and in the ocean which is at the most 2 miles deep covering 71% of the earths surface. His cartoon of a little girls ice creeam cone melting is not compelling evidence.<br /><br />The so called conveyor belt of global warming alarmists must have been dreamed up by TV weathermen. Translating their knowledge of atmospheric conveyor belt knowledge to the ocean does not quite explain the theory. Maybe they should leave oceanology to oceanologists and stick to climatology or take some basic physics courses on fluid dynamics. As far as the atmosphere is concerned  air can be heated by land that has been heated by the sun and thus rise displacing any cold air above it. It can then be cooled as it travels to another area where it may condense, sink, and  displace the air below it. But  the ocean floor is not heated by the sun and therefore cold sea water on the bottom cannot heat up, expand and rise to the surface. Supposedly the warm water now heated travels north on the surface loosing heat to the atmosphere on the way to the north and become more dense than the colder sea water below it. The key factors to look at is the density of the water and it salinity (salt content).The saltier the water  the more dense it is. Also the colder the water is the more dense it is. That is unless it is frozen as frozen water expands and becomes less dense. So global warming experts?  would have us believe that lighter  water on the surface of the ocean somehow magically becomes more dense than the colder salty water below it and sink. Sorry everyone but maybe someone can explain that one to me. Oh yeah, according to politicians who have a better understanding than scientist its true  because they  said it is true. After all, have politicians ever lied to the public? Naw, can't ever imagine that ever happening. In addition Gore tries to imply that the melting of ice on water will cause a rise in seas level. Not so. First of all when ice over water melts it has no effect on the level of the ocean.(try putting ice cubes in a glass of water and melt it) In addition frozen water takes up more volume than its liquid form so shrinks. On top of that the ice is formed from precipitation and contains no salt so is less dense than the salt water below it and does not sink when it does melt.<br /><br />Apparently Al Gore is helping big oil and the 5 major automobile companies is indiverting attention towards harmless gas (CO2) and away from harmful gases (NOx, SOx, CO, and other pollution from automobile emissions causing  air pollution. Why? Its impossible to solve the NOX problem.. In improving the combustion of carbon based fuels in internal combustion engines an increase in NOX is unavoidable. Incomplete combusted carbon based fuels are carcenogens.When we increase the combustion of CO and gasoline  components we reduce the amount of dangerous hydrocarbons but we increase the amount of acid rain causing compounds. These gases (NOX and SOX) are not harmless. Nitrogen oxides, or NOx, is the generic term for a group of highly reactive gases, all of which contain nitrogen and oxygen in varying amounts. Many of the nitrogen oxides are colorless and odorless. However, one common pollutant, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) along with particles in the air can often be seen as a reddish-brown layer over many urban areas.<br /><br />Nitrogen oxides form when fuel is burned at high temperatures, as in a combustion process. The primary manmade sources of NOx are motor vehicles, electric utilities, and other industrial, commercial, and residential sources that burn fuels.<br /><br />A variety of Federal and State regulatory initiatives are aimed at reducing nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from electricity generators. NOx emissions are a concern because they contribute to the formation of acid rain and, either directly or through the creation of ozone, lead to harmful effects on human health. It has been determined that the combustion of fossil fuels is the major source of NOx emissions. According to estimates made by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), highway vehicles accounted for 35 percent of the 22 million tons of NOx emissions in the United States in 1995, and electric utilities accounted for 29 percent.<br />To address this issue, electric utilities began complying in 1996 with the first phase of the acid deposition control regulations established by the EPA under Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA90). This first phase places limits on NOx emissions from 239 older coal-fired generating units. Overall, the utilities that operate the affected units achieved a 40-percent reduction in the emissions rates of the units and a total reduction of approximately 340,000 tons of NOx emissions in 1996 from their 1990 levels. In most cases, the units were retrofitted with low-NOx burners that control fuel and air mixing to limit NOx formation. Potential lawsuits for cancer and other illnesses from fossil fuels would cost the Oil Companies billions of dollars if the Oil Companies weren't able to show that similar compounds can also be found in trace amounts in cigarettes . When it was shown that nonsmokers have just as high illnesses and smokers the Oil Companies paid the ACS millions in contributions to do more studies to show second hand smoke was the cause. now that defense is weakening a new ploy is being used to divert attention from its pollutants--Global Warming.  Carbon Dioxide is completely harmless to animal and plant life so makes a good diversion from the real problems of fossil fuel uses.<br />Much is not known about causes of modern diseases such as cancer, Parkinson and Alzheimer as well as countless other wide spread afflictions.

When zinc ore was discovered on some of Gore's land, Hammer and Oxy bought it fortwice the amount of the only other bid. Hammer then sold the land back to Gore while retaining the mineral rights. The elder Gore then sold the land to his son, Al Jr., who has received $20,000 yearly in mineral royalties from Occidental ever since. Two years after Gore Sr. was defeated in a bid for re-election to the Senate, he joined Occidental as a member of its board of directors and was rewarded with a $500,000 a year job working for an Oxy subsidiary.<br /><br />Throughout his political life, Al Gore Jr. has received the favor the patronage of Occidental Oil and Hammer's successor, CEO Ray Irani. And for every campaign finance violation Gore has committed, Irani seems to be lurking in the background. He was one of the contributors who slept in the Lincoln bedroom (a couple days later Irani wrote a $100,000 check to the DNC). When Al Gore made illegal fundraising calls from the White House, Irani was one of the recipients (he ponied up $50,000, according to a Harold Ickes memo unearthed during the investigation). In the Elk Hills sell-off , Irani and Oxy finally got the payoff worthy of their long patronage. It is a payoff crooked businessmen have dreamed of ever since the land was stripped from the Kitanemuks during the Gold Rush. Indeed, the history of Elk Hills and corruption is an old one. And it is a story most Americans have heard.<br /><br />In conclusion if you want a big laugh get this movie but if you have a weak stomach avoid it at all costs.shed by the EPA under Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA90).

In the Elk Hills sell-off , Irani and Oxy finally got the payoff worthy of their long patronage. It is a payoff crooked businessmen have dreamed of ever since the land was stripped from the Kitanemuks during the Gold Rush. Indeed, the history of Elk Hills and corruption is an old one. And it is a story most Americans have heard.<br /><br />In conclusion if you want a big laugh get this movie but if you have a weak stomach avoid it at all costs.

B000UR9TQO|5.0|I received my set today from Amazon.  I've read all the reviews here and just wanted to add a few details.<br /><br />01. The T-shirt is not bad at all. I buy all my rock shirts extra large and this fits me perfectly, even has the Swan Song logo on the back.  If you have purchased the new Double CD soundtrack which in enclosed in a paper case that is wider than a regular plastic one (Very Well Done) once you remove the shirt it fits perfectly in the box and keeps the other items from shaking around. Coincidence?<br /><br />02.  If you want to send for the free BIG poster that is offered with this set (27x40)the UPC code you must mail in with your order is on the printed paper sheet on the outside of the back of the box so you don't have to cut it off of the box itself leaving a hole.<br /><br />03.  The cards and pictures are very nice to browse through and the case that holds them is also very cool.<br /><br />04.  I'll let others review at length the DVD content, but for me it was all great, the sound was excellent.  When I put the first DVD in after listening to a Guns N Roses DVD the sound was Much Louder and I had to turn the receiver down.<br /><br />05.  All and all a great deal very cheap - Thanks Dudes for making my Holiday Season this year Alot Brighter ! ! !
B000MVN8HE|5.0|You can never go wrong with Veronica Mars.  The best series I never watched while it was on TV.  Didn't realize until it was cancelled that it was so much more than a teen movie.  Unbox is great but I'd spend a few more bucks and buy the DVD if you can.  You get some bonus material including the gags.  I think its worth it for something you will watch over and over.  Also Seasons 1 and 2 are very reasonable on DVD but not available on Unbox.

B000V8I2QU|5.0|Springsteen is amzing on this album. Loved it! He needs to stick with the E-Street Band because they do fabulous work together.
B00004S367|4.0|Look, I'm a massive Stevie Wonder fan. If you ask me, all his albums from Talking Book to Hotter Than July are absolute essentials, and along with the Rolling Stones he was the best musician of the '70s. I even like most of In Square Circle, though it takes a lot of abuse. And this... well, there's a lot to like about it. It's mostly creative. It's consistent. It has a couple great songs. But in truth I don't feel this ranks among his best material. There are a mere nine songs here, and only five of those nine are any good. The atmospheric space-funk-jazz - think Pink Floyd, almost - \\"Superwoman\\" is obviously the best, one of the two that does rank among Stevie's best material. The other is the powerful funk of \\"Keep On Runnin'\\", with a fantastic clavinet part and great refrain. Okay, maybe the non-space funk \\"Love Having You Around\\" does too, if I'm in a good mood. And \\"I Love Every Little Thing About You\\" is pleasant, at least. Unlike \\"Sweet Little Girl\\". That slurred voice over really gets on my nerves. I'm sure it's supposed to be a parody or something, but it's a bad parody. I gotta admit, though, that part about Sweet Sweetback and the \\"I love you more than my clavinet!\\" line is funny. Too bad he had to say it in the stupid slurred drunk voice. It just may be the worst song of his \\"mature\\" career. \\"Happier Than the Morning Sun\\" is annoyingly minimalist, not as much of a song as it is Stevie playing an annoying harpsichord-like keyboard and reciting some dull love song lyrics; \\"Girl Blue\\" is a particularly painful ballad with more trite lyrics (this is one Wonder release you don't listen to for its lyrics - unlike the next five. It's also got those damn phased vocals). He's just getting to know synthesizers here, too: sometimes he works wonders with them (the closing sermon \\"Evil\\"; funky \\"Keep on Running\\"; jazzy on \\"Superwoman\\"), sometimes he works blunders with them (\\"Seems so Long\\"). So this is slightly uneven and not as consistent as what was to come, in spite of containing one or two of Wonder's greatest songs. A few words more about the lyrics: Stevie was nowhere near his socially relevant peak here. Every song but \\"Evil\\" is a love song, which isn't bad, but hey, I've heard a lot of love songs. More to the point, both \\"Love Having You Around\\" and \\"I Love Everything About You\\" contain the lyric \\"You've been (or stuck) with me through thick and thin\\" - in fact, the lyrics to those two and \\"Happier Than the Morning Sun\\" are essentially the same things. And both \\"Sweet Little Girl\\" and \\"Girl Blue\\" use the term \\"Little girl\\" predominately, which shows me he didn't really put much thought into these lyrics. But the next five albums are fantastic. Especially the follow-up, Talking Book. Please do get all of those. They rule.te of containing one or two of Wonder's greatest songs.

B000005RFQ|5.0|There are some different reviews here about this album.  PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE DORKOS BEHIND THIER REVIEWS.  What is important is \\"Do You Like It\\"?    I love Queen, Opera, Metallica, Puscifer, ABBA, Erasure, Styx, The 2nd Chapter of Acts, quite a gamut here.  What I will say in all honostey ... I have purchased all Black Sabbath CDs at least once or twice,  but I know for sure I have bought Born Again three times.  This is one of the first I turn to for good hard Black Sabbath.    The lyrics sound dark ... like in \\"Disturbing The Priest\\".  Although I don't have any pro- or ante- \\"upsetting priests\\" sentiment ... the lyrics pose interesting queries ... and I love to use them for Halloween background sounds.    BITCHIN' ALBUM!!!   I will always own it and enjoy it.  BUY & TRY it!
B000W04S6U|5.0|As much as I love Halo 3 I have to admit the music sounds a lot like Halo 2's music.  But this is by far better than Halo 2's music though.[[ASIN:B000W04S6U Halo 3 Original Soundtrack (2-CD Set)]]
B00005214X|5.0|I love this album.  Most of the extras are good as well.  My one complaint is My Sweet Lord 2000.  What was he thinking?  The instrumental of \\"What is Life\\" is a fantastic bonus.  If you enjoy good music, buy this.
B000I186FW|5.0|An utterly amazing film that critics have tried to dismiss. It paints the picture of a destopic future where governments use spin, fear and attacks on its own people to fulfill their own political ambitions.    You only have to look around you at the state of the world today to see that Yes in fact, this is what is happening now.    You'll be shouting BS at the endless spin the media spew out to convince us to send our sons to their deaths in eternal wars against an enemy that has never actually been proven to exist.    A superb complimentary read is by Andrew M. Lobaczewski, Political Ponerology: A science on the nature of evil adjusted for political purposes    Don't let this movie just wash over you as harmless entertainment, the message is clear if you wake up to what governments are really about. Do they really have our best interests at heart?  the answer is No.    V for vendetta beautifully illustrates through the character portraid by Portman, how inner strength and integrity is an intimidating weapon. A must see movie.
B000002KAT|5.0|Astral Weeks-Van Morrison *****<br /><br />To lengthly go into discrition of Astral Weeks, Van Morrison's 1970's debut full length album, and not to mention his career best would be more or less pointless. While there will never be enough praise given to an album of this callebur it does not however need the praise.<br /><br />Astral Weeks is an album that since the enitial release and will well into the future stand on it's own. As said before this stood out like an adult in a daycare center of rock albums when released, well it still does. Such sophistication on Astral weeks is nearly impossible to disect. The poetry of the lyrics rivals some of the best of that era, including the great Allen Ginsberg. The subject matter of love and social commentary are sometimes breathtaking and at other times earth shattering.<br /><br />But the true amazment of this album is that of the vocal ability the Morrison displays. His soulful R&B style mixed with gosphel tones make for one sweet ride.<br /><br />The band was told nothing of what to play, \\"Just to follow as I go,\\" is what Morrison ordered in the studio. They nailed it. It's no wonder Lester Bangs, the worst all time best music critic hailed this as the only thing he would want if he was trapped on a desert island. Pure bliss.
B0009XFMXS|5.0|This is an import from Arista Europe. Upon first glance, the only difference between this and the American version is that this CD is cleverly made to resemble a vinyl disc from it's 1975 release, not 1968 as the Amazon product description states.  The good news is that the difference between this version and the US version extends far beyond the merely superficial and cosmetic. This soundtrack sounds so crisp, it sizzles! No wonder, since it's a 20-bit transfer mastered from the original tapes.  I've been a huge fan of Bernard Hermann (and Martin Scorsese) for many years and I've never heard this music sound so sparklingly clear and detailed. Beyond all this, there's a stunning dynamic range on this disc that simply blows the US version out of the water.  I'm completely delighted with the sonic quality of this disc and would recommend it without reservation to anyone who appreciates Bernard Hermann's incomparable scoring.

0061547832|3.0|My Review is actually 3.5 Stars. I am a fan of Donald Trump which is why I bought this book however Bill Zanker kind of annoyed me. He came across as a little mini-me basically saying the same thing Donald just said in the book. I enjoyed the book but he kind of was out of place. I think if he had wrote the book himself he would have been okay but he wanted to make sure it had a great chance for success so he let Donald take the lead,stayed in the shadow, and repeated everything. Now with that said this book has plenty of advice you can learn from but you have to read the book with an open mind to gain the knowledge. This book is not for everyone but I did enjoy it for the most part. Donald does slide in a few punches at some people he does not like and says a few things regarding his life that not everyone will appreciate. However if you just take what you need from the book and move on you will be fine and should enjoy it.
B00006AW2M|5.0|This is one of those records (before I got the CD) that you would not ever want to lift the needle and skip a song.  Great from start to finish.

B0001KZM3O|5.0|Any fan comparing this album to Wish You Were Here or Animals is missing the point.  The Final Cut, like The Wall, is pretty much a Roger Waters album performed by Pink Floyd.  He wrote all of the tracks and even sings the majority of them (as opposed to earlier Floyd).  With that said, this is an amazing album.  This is a concept album about post-WWII England and it also has quite a bit of material focusing on Waters' issues with his wife.  Sound familiar?  Unlike The Wall, however, there is no drug-induced psychosis or obscure references to facist dictatorships.  This album brings closure to all of the issues that Waters brought up in The Wall and he was writing at his lyrical best.  Although the rest of the band seems absent much of the time (Wright wasn't even on this record), David Gilmour's guitar work is top notch... In fact, I think this is the finest work he has ever done on any single album.  So if The Wall was a bit over-dramatic for you (and even if it wasn't), check this out.  It's a fitting departure for Waters, even if he was a prick.
B000PKG7I4|2.0|i picked this album up the week it was released in 2003 when i was in london and the first two listens are reasonably enjoyable, but the album doesnt age well, the songs arent terribly well written, and it gets grating after a while.    do yourself a favor and check out Alice Russell, Nicole Willis and the Soul Investigators, or Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings instead.
140120306X|2.0|Let me start off by saying that I am a huge fan of the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. That being said, I was sadly disapointed with this book. I enjoyed the first section of the graphic novel. The idea of setting up the characters in a post 1984 world was a stroke of brilliance. However, that is the only section of the graphic novel where such praise can be given.     We are only presented with one character from the original series and quite honestly if they hadnt shown the bite marks on her neck, I would never have made the connection that it was her. The other protaginst, the son of an original league member, is not developed at all. I will say that Moore's take on James Bond is an interesting addition, but the other new characters were rather boring additions.    The bulk of the book is the titular Black Dossier. I agree with severeal of the previous reviews in that it is pretty hit or miss. I enjoyed the history of Orlando and some of the later sections, but for the most part I would often find myself skipping over sections hoping that something interesting would present itself. Fortunately, none of the text is rellevant to the plot of the graphic novel.    The ending of the graphic novel is done in 3D. It is almost completely unreadable. I meen that both in the sense that reading the 3d text gave me a headache, and that the direction the plot takes is so horrendous that it actually manages to tarnish the previous volumes that I loved so much. I can honestly say that the Movie of the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen did the source material better justice than the creator did in this instance.    I realize that my review is a little disjointed, but that simply makes it no better than the source material. I could probably list a couple dozen more aspects of the graphic novel that annoyed me, but really what im trying to say is that they all added up to a very unsatisfying experience. If you must read this edition I would recommend waiting until they releasea trade paperback. Otherwise, I would recommend saving your $30.00 and putting it towards buying the absolute edition of the original graphic novels.
B00006GFA1|5.0|This album is a must-have for any rock fan. It has alot of the Queens' best songs, and really, at $1.00 new, you can't get much better than that. A+ If you don't trust me, listen to No One Knows, Millionare, and Song for the Deaf, the 3 best on this.
6304712936|5.0|Life and music of of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Wonderous setting and costumes. Murray Abraham is amazing as the villianous Antonio Salieri. Well worthwhile adding to the the DVD library. Buy the CD for the music.
B000SO7OM0|5.0|Consider buying this album if you've never heard Loreena's music: it's a splendid overview of her 20+ years of studio work.  If you were a little disappointed (as I was) with the pedestrian pace of her previous studio album, \\"An Ancient Muse,\\" don't let that chase you away from this one.  I've never seen McKennitt live, but I can imagine now that it must be an entirely moving experience.  Her voice retains all its studio power here, and the arrangements on several songs provide interesting twists on their studio originals.    Only one song, Marco Polo, seems to suffer in live form: the percussive power of the original is replaced by an inadequate instrumental substitutes.  Also, Loreena's occasionally sloppy articulation still creeps in here and there.  But these are very minor quibbles.  Mystic's Dream, a song which can't be easy to reproduce live, sounds very good here.  I had never heard \\"Stolen Child,\\" from her 1985 (her first album?) Elemental, which I'll have to add to the stereo at some point.      I'm once again excited to see her next release, and especially to experience the live show finally.  Hope you enjoy the show too.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I absolutely loved RATATOUILLE! It had all the 'ingredients' I was looking for in a Brad Bird film  : Heart, Wit, and high - end animation.  When I heard all the critics giving this movie rave reviews, I couldn't pass this one up.     I'm not going to get into a detailed review, being that everyone else has done that already. However, I will tell you this: If you love and respect PIXAR work, do not pass this movie up! This work of art is up there with 'THE INCREDIBLES' and 'CARS'. Brad Bird is a bonafide genius who definetely understands true humor without over doing it. It also knew when to be serious with out underdoing it. Actually, this film didn't lack anything. I look forward to seeing more PIXAR from Brad BIrd in the future.
0553383663|2.0|I would not be surprised if this book was funded by Google as a way to get people to work for them or create positive publicity for the company.  It's basically an ad campaign praising Google and its founders, seemingly written by Google's greatest fans.  The authors gush over Google like it's the greatest thing in the universe and the savior of humanity.  They go into detail about side projects of Google and characterize how cool and life changing these projects are.  There is mention of a few negative challenges of Google such as privacy (with Gmail) and some legal issues with Microsoft over hiring a guy in China, but there is no conclusion to those stories.  The author's simply jump into other glorious projects of Google.  They go into great length about the head chef of Google as if they had to fill a page quota.  Why are they talking about the head chef??  Unfocused, completely biased and shallow (nothing 'inside' was really revealed about Google.)  The first 1/4 of the book was interesting, though I'm sure you could find the same content on the web.  The rest of the book was painful to get through.  If you are a Google worshiper, you'll love this book.  If you're looking for a good unbiased look at the company, look elsewhere.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I was very excited when I received my Gilmore Girls Complete Series Package. But, I was even more excited when I saw the packaging. There is no other word to describe this but cute. Reminiscent of Barbie boxes where you would store your Barbies or paper dolls and, which at the same time, served as the background setting for playing with them. The outside packaging is about a foot tall (maybe less); it is made of a cushiony material and opens up to reveal a \\"background set\\". It even has a handle that which allows you to carry your boxed set with ease. Inside you find each season in individual folders, same size as the outside box, where 2 CD fit in each side, lengthwise. Each disc is numbered. The set also includes an Episode Guide Book. I like the fact that the entire episode guide is in one book instead of several small ones. This makes it easier to look for the shows you want to watch. The descriptions of the episodes are not the best though, they are extremely concise and short. Instead, most of the space of the Episode Guide book is dedicated to tons and tons of pictures from the Gilmore Girls series and the cast. There is also a book for \\"Gilmore-isms\\", a book which tries to elucidate us into the many popular culture references throughout the show. This is a great item included in the set. It tells you the popular culture reference, what it is and in which episode it appeared. I find this book extremely entertaining.<br /><br />I think this is a great and smart packaging for the series and if you don't already have the series in individual discs, then you should buy this. Also, the price is great for what the package contains.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I have to say in my entire life I've never been so entertained by a single live performance. Shania delivers a great show, with a super band and a wonderful voice...  It is her best live DVD so far and the very best music experience you could ever need...  Breathtaking!

0743496728|3.0|I didn't know the plot of Nineteen Minutes until Zoe heard the explosion as she waited for her mother.<br /><br />I was pulled in to most of the characters' stories: the Cormiers, the Houghtons, the other teenagers. Patrick Ducharme's and the McAfee's stories just didn't interest me. I was interested in how everything would flow together, so I kept up with all of their stories throughout the first part. Yes, Picoult throws in many shocking teenage behaviors- nothing I'd condone (fake IDs, sex, drugs, alcohol, adult clubs). While I don't believe that such behaviors are the norm for today's teens, I felt that they made the plot worthwhile. I especially appreciated the complexities of Josie's climb to the upper echelon of popularity. Her relationship with Matt is painful- but I think it shows how much she was craving love- from her absent father and her career-obsessed mother.<br /><br />Alex's budding relationship sours the end of part one. It was predictable, given that the guy goes out of his way to flirt with her. Such situations were so pathetic, they were almost painful to read.<br /><br />PArt two is just boring. No indepth research on the NH legal system was done. It reads like a stretched out second half of a Law and Order episode. The \\"surprise twist\\" leaves us wondering if one death, committed by another student, was accidental or intentional. Peter gets eight consecutive sentences, how will he react?<br /><br />Picoult ends the book with an ueber-cheesy scene between a very pregnant Alex and her new man. BARF ALERT!!!
B000002GKT|5.0|...get this CD. It'll be like the coolest water on the hottest day. The Godfather of Blues Rock, the late Steve Marriott, with his fine band of merry men (Peter Frampton among them, as well as the late Greg Ridley on bass and Jerry Shirley on drums) take the stage to shred, mince, dice, julienne your mind, and then savagely rip your liver out through your nose and make some sort of weird Japanese entrée out of it. This album is sorely underrated in the annals of rock history and deserves a spot among the best; It establishes the band as a good studio act and an even better live act (As is in the case of Frampton in his solo years). There's only one flaw: the censor's bleep during \\"Rolling Stone\\", which is easily overlooked due to the great quality of the music. A must for ANY rocker's CD library, I recommend it without reservation. ROCK ON!
B000WC39ZY|3.0|Considering the chaotic, often drug-fuelled circumstances of its production, New York, New York seems a lot more disciplined and successful than it has any right to be. While there's never once a sense or flavor of New York - this is pure Hollywood all the way - Scorsese's mixture of stylised settings and naturalistic drama goes beyond the traditional happy ending and takes what starts out a standard boy-meets-girl musical plotline into darker emotional territory. It may lose its way towards the and (partially due to the overlong Happy Endings number taking us away from the characters for too long), but it gets a lot more right than it gets wrong, and has a great use of color. It was also interesting to compare the theatrical version and director's cut included on the DVD - surely the easiest restoration ever since Scorsese literally cut two reels and left the rest of the film intact.
B0053TWVDC|4.0|I enjoyed this King adaption. He who walks behind the rose...
B000I0RNVG|5.0|If Nuovo Cinema Paradiso isn't one of your favourite films, you probably haven't seen it.     With the Paradiso serving as the focal point for a small Sicilian village, its changing sense of community and values beautifully realised and mirrored through the changing cinematic trends, few modern films have so many wonderful moments - the village priest censoring movies with his hand bell ever at the ready; a villager asking another what a rolling title says only to find out that he's illiterate too; the young Toto acting out a film while he holds a discarded strip of celluloid to the light; that great final montage... the list could go on for ages.    Still a deeply emotional experience, some of the film's most moving moments are its most understated, such as the young Toto editing out a newsreel reference to war dead in Russia to save his mother's feelings or the sadness in Alfredo's face as he watches the villagers in the square marvel at the film he shows on a townhouse wall.    But the version that won its way into the hearts of millions of filmgoers and critics alike in 1990 was not the original film. Originally called Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, it made its bow in Italy at 156-minutes to appalling reviews and bad business before being cut by half an hour for the foreign markets and taking the Cannes Film Festival by storm and later causing a minor storm of controversy after it won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film (since then, films re-edited from their original version are no longer eligible for the award). Such was the film's success that by the mid-90's, Giuseppe Tornatore was able to not only restore the deleted footage but add other scenes he was forced to cut in a near three-hour director's cut. While some of it is merely additional shots or, in a couple of cases, redubbed dialogue, the film's last act was massively extended as the grown-up Toto (Jacques Perrin) meets his first love Elena (Brigitte Fossey, cut out of the two hour cut entirely) and learns what really happened and gets the chance to give their love story a proper ending...    Is it a better film? In many ways yes, though it is a much darker, more melancholy one with more of a sense of loss and missed opportunities. The cuts had the effect of making sections of the film give in to nostalgia, which this version undercuts more adeptly. This is more about the terrible price that the love of cinema exerts - Alfredo's sight, Toto's one true love. When Salvatore returns from the village at the end of the picture, he has no-one to return to or anything to return to but a film award, the glittering prizes of work devalued as he realises he has no life but film. One of the all-time great endings, the stolen kisses at the end of the film now seem that much sadder and carry a much more real and painful sense of loss.    This collectors edition is at least the fifth time round on DVD for Giuseppe Tornatore's perennial, but with the original two-and-a-half hour version that played to disastrous business in Italy still unreleased, don't be surprised if somewhere down the line there'll be a sixth issue `ultimate edition' to get people to buy it all over again!
B000VWYNNW|5.0|As some have stated that..this isn't the same show as the original double live album, well it isn't. I'm glad it isn't number 1 the extra songs are great and number 2 we get a listen to the other days Jimi and the band were jamming/experimenting at this great venue.(Same song played the same way everyday... boring). I know being a musician. Why would you want that? Embelish a little have fun mates. Remember people,they played 3 days there. I think a lot of people are meant to believe that this is simply one night, its not. This was a chance for the band to hear/see themselves really.Remember these are LIVE performances from DIFFERENT NIGHTS I have to give these blistering performances 5 stars What else I say it's ZEPPELIN LIVE!!.

B00005YW4H|1.0|I was waiting to speak to my travel agent; it was a long wait and there was music from a radio station. The music I heard was particularly bad, annoying even; I started to become uncomfortable and had to keep the phone away from my ear: it was really getting on my nerves, and I'm not exagerating. The music was so bland, insipid. The songs were so bad that I had to jot the lyrics down from that monotonous country twangy sound I heard, just to see who was the \\"artist\\" resposnible for this cacophonic offense to music, stereo systems, and those who appreciate really good music; who could possibly have written such a song and singing style. And so it is that I discovered Norah Jones; akin to waking up discovering you have to go to the dentist that morning. The wait on the phone was long and one bad song after another by Norah continued their incessant offense on my auditory apparatus, confirming and accenting my original impression. It's sad that the alternative to so much modern pop garbage is garbage all the same.

0307387178|1.0|As I understand it, \\"Into the Wild\\" started life as an article in Outdoors Magazine, and frankly, that is where it should have stayed.<br /><br />Given the amount of information known about MacCandless' suicidal trip into the wilderness, this whole story could be covered comprehensively in about 5 pages.  The other 195 pages of Krakauer's book are anecdotes from MacCandless' friends and family, plus a few largely anecdotal stories about other travelers; i.e., filler.<br /><br />As far as the mental illness theme of this book goes: we have all known mentally ill young people.  My college room mate was a kind, generous, brilliant guy, excellent musician, and ended up committed to an institution by age 22.  MacCandless was an eccentric guy with an odd father, damaged by the revelation that his father had an odd plural marriage arrangement.  His deranged sense of wilderness romanticism exceeded his grasp on reality  by many miles.<br /><br />As far as travel goes, not an altogether interesting book.  Lots of people travel among fringe elements in the US, lots of people go to Alaska. I would suggest that \\"One Man Caravan\\" is infinitely more interesting travel story.  When I was young I hitched all over the US and Europe, but I never set my money on fire, never abandoned my parents, and never walked calmly into a certain death situation.<br /><br />And as far as using the wilderness the help cure depression, I strongly suggest one of the best books ever written about being a contemplative young man: \\"The Nick Adams Stories\\", by Hemingway.<br /><br />Still, I admire Krakauer as a very fortunate businessman.  Through his magazine article and book, he has somehow come to \\"own\\" the MacCandless story, and I suspect he will make a tidy piece of change from the movie without doing much. I noted one two minute scene in the film came from two small sentences in the book.<br /><br />I read this book only because my daughter had to read it for high school.  If not for the fact that we had a good discussion about recognizing fun craziness vs terminal craziness in young people, I would have considered it a small waste of time.we had a good discussion about recognizing fun craziness vs terminal craziness in young people, I would have considered it a small waste of time.
B00005JOFQ|4.0|This is a heart-breaking story about love, loss, and identity.  Being a straight man, I identified with Jack and Ennis in that I've often felt marginalized for various reasons.  How do you cope with that?  How do you overcome insurmountable odds?  What I really found interesting about this film is that as the story unfolds you start to see Jack and Ennis not so much as gay/bisexual men, but rather as people in love.  I can't think of any other movie that accomplishes this feat.  I do believe that Brokeback Mountain should have beaten Crash for best picture.  Crash was great and all, but not quite the caliber of Brokeback.
0805079831|4.0|Naomi Klein has a convincing thesis, but the evidence she offers in support of it is kinda \\"hit or miss\\".  Some of it is apropos and some of it just plain silly.  It's as if I argued \\"The earth is round.  One reason we know this is that when a ship approaches, you see the top of the mast above the horizon first.  Another reason is that tennis balls are round, tennis balls fall towards the earth, therefore the earth must be round\\".      Klein's original thesis - that players in international corporate capitalism  use social upheaval to their financial advantage, and that they justify this in terms of a particular kind of economic theory - is convincing.      She developed the thesis initially in an analysis of what went wrong in Iraq (in an article for Harpers magazine, I think it was) and that was a very compelling piece.  She has admitted in radio interviews that this book is an attempt to expand the scope of the article, by looking for \\"disaster capitalism\\" around the world.  In so doing, I believe she overextends herself.    Seek and ye shall find!  Having already decided on what she wanted to find in each case, Klein ends up frequently making the facts fit the theory, rather than the theory fit the facts - a flaw she shares with George W. Bush.  (I know that comparison would anger both parties, but I do think it's apt).    In SOME cases (e.g. Chile, New Orleans, Iraq) the fit between thesis and evidence seems very good.  In others (South Africa, China, England) it comes across as horribly contrived.      One problem is that her concept of what a \\"shock\\" is is too broad.  The Falklands War, the coup in Chile, the Tiananmen massacre... all these events serve the same purpose.  Basically, Klein considers England, looks for something she can call a shock, and writes it up.  Then she examines Poland, decides what the \\"shock\\" would be there, and so on.    Another problem is that Klein ignores almost all the scholarly literature on social engineering.  Her topic is actually much richer and interesting than she seems to realize.  I think she's sacrificed depth for breadth in her analysis - piling on more case studies at the expense of fully delving into the ones that work best.    Klein also tends to want to have things both ways.  In Poland, for example, the shock therapy was severe enough to cause massive unemployment and other ills - but on the very next page she concedes that most of the economy (62%) was NOT privatized (due to heroic resistance). Did Poland receive the full shock?  Klein waffles.    She also tends towards economic determinism.  But that's actually OK.  Because many people, and most Americans, underestimate the role of economic motives/forces.  As a result, a strident and readable assertion that those motives are ubiquitous and fundamental can serve an important sensitizing purpose.  It will alert readers to real (even if sometimes exaggerated) forces that might otherwise escape their attention.    Klein also does a great job of debunking the pious platitudes of her political adversaries.  Throughout the book, she exposes the contradictions, evasions and self-serving denials/lies of many powerful and influential people.  In so doing, she probably upsets the taken-for-granted world view of many of her readers.    5 stars for provocation.  4 stars for style.  2 stars for rigor of research.
B000UR9T8C|5.0|If this film would have come out first in the series it would have been hailed a 10, but as it is the expectations were so high that it was bound to get knit-picked. Everyone had years to think about what this movie should be. . . and that in itself shows how very loved this character in this series is. They did an excellent job bringing Peter Parker to life not only visually: in convincing, clever action scenes,  but emotionally, with Tobey Maguire, who was the first actor to portray a super hero as a human being we can identify with. We forget how these films broke the mold for a whole new type of hero movie. And in this film we see the Peter Parker of comic books, intellectual and smart-off confident. It's an excellent end to a great run. Get the set and watch them in order. . .
B000WZB944|2.0|Joshua Tree = Jumping the Shark<br /><br />The one time in history the mullet was actually cool was when Bono had it atop his head during the U2 set at Live Aid and the Red Rocks concert two years beforehand.  When the band played the Amnesty International concert, Edge looked like a longhaired rabbi, and Bono looked like Natalie Merchant.  Adam?  A concentration camp intern and Larry, well, he looked like Larry.  I know I'm focusing on image but it was the 1980s, there weren't much more, guv'nor.  It seemed like when the image changed, so did their music.  A lot of people got into the band with this album, and this is where I got out of their music.<br /><br />The ringing guitars and the yelped vocals moved back in the mix, messing with a formula that worked to brilliant effect up to that point.  After this album came the overexposure and all the big songs off this played ad nauseum on eMpTy V (ooh look, you briefly see a nipple) and the radio.  I bought this again just to make sure I wasn't being too unkind to the lads (another holiday they tricked me).  I wasn't.  This is so overdone and worn out.  The bonus disc has a lot of stuff that appeared on the 80-90 CD and their one flash of brilliance, the cover of Darlene Love's \\"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)\\" from the period not on this compilation.  They were a band with a message and the message here is: RUN AWAY.<br /><br />Don't worry about Bono's declaration of \\"I Will Follow,\\" either.  He's too busy scraping the bottom of the barrel to do so.<br /><br />Signed,<br />epsteinsmutha

B000WMEAKC|5.0|even before i knew exactly who they were.  I knew that when i heard \\"Apoligize\\" on Timbaland's Shock Value cd that i was loving One Republic.  I just kept hoping it would catch on and become a smash like it did for me.  It has done that and thrust One Republic right into the forefront.  They really take advantage of it on the album as well.  With just every song on Dreaming Out Loud being a potential radio hit.  It's hard to choose favorites and what not.<br /><br />I wont say that and will just tell you that you really need to check out this new cd by One Republic.  The lyrics, the music, the vocals (are so passionate and heartfelt especially on Apologize) that you can't help but feel what Ryan is singing about.  He's also an excellent writer, believe he wrote all the songs on the cd and was already an hit making writer for various artists like J-Lo (Do It Well) and many others.<br /><br />One Republic is one of those band's that you can't help fall in love with and route for.  They have a lot going for them on this cd and if i had to bet.  I would say you will be hearing a lot more from them in the years to come.  Excellent purchase and value (1 song) that i didnt really like that much \\"Won't Stop\\" other than that its a smash from beginning to end.

B0009X7664|5.0|Perhaps somewhere in the very far future when African Americans and Caucasian Americans have finally learned to see each other as brothers and sisters and not a human of color, then looking back on this film will seem strange and wistful. Until that time, we can do no better than to sit down and read the book and then watch this perfect movie adaptation.    There are other great books and movies that cover the depression years in America. \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" comes to mind. Harper Lee's book and this film focus not on the displaced as much as how one person can rise to the occasion, show a strong moral spine and true courage. It would have been too simple to say that the film was about prejudice. Coming to the screen as it did during the rising cauldron of the Civil Rights movement, this film was a perfect mirror for the haunting specter that refused to shed its shadow over the south. In the aftermath of the ruinous Civil War, southern states, especially the Carolina's which led the revolt, suffered very badly during and after the war. In some places poverty and destitution never left the land. What did people do to get by in the depression era? Did they fall back on old ways and use scapegoats to satisfy the blame game? Certainly and that is where the story here begins.    The audience watching this film in 1962 was familiar with prejudice but rarely had it seen a white man treat an African American with respect and a resolute commitment to seeking justice. There are other sinister themes that rise to the surface. The implication of a daughter being beaten by a drunken father, the taboo of a white woman seducing a black man, the injustice done to a mentally handicapped man by shuttering him like a prisoner in his own home; these are all hot buttons that would have made an audience squirm and disquiet their comfort zones. Even more ugly was the false accusation of an honest man, a person that was expected to be found guilty even by his own peers simply because he was avisible minority; this was the deep south and prejudice was so widespread.     The richness of the story gives depth and detail to the lives of Atticus Finch and his fiercely independent children as they explore their lives. With several subplots swirling around the main trial, the audience is given constant stimulation in vivid colors of human drama. Shot in black and white and blessed with a superb script, one of the greatest male actors in the English speaking world, a sublime musical score by Elmer Bernstein, two child actors who were so natural that they became Atticus's children in a real way.....this film is iconic in American cinema and for so many good reasons. Perhaps Gregory Peck's greatest role, this film is unforgettable and has taken on a tinge of greatness that is entirely worthy of its craft. If you must own one Peck film, this is the one. As the saying goes, they simply don't make them like this anymore; what a pity.
B000YAF4OS|3.0|*spoilers*    I really loved most of Darabont's version of The Mist. I had no problem with the CG and I thought the actors were always adequate and sometimes superb.  Mrs. Carmody was actually an improvement on King, who sometimes tends to make villains into comic book characters.    Everyone is talking about the ending, and how dark it is.  Now I hated the ending, because it is so POSITIVE. Didn't you notice? Is anyone paying attention? In the story, the world appears doomed. In the film, the world is saved! Olly olly oxen free, everyone come on out and play. How asinine. It wasn't true to the story at all. It was a contrivance to make a cheap Twilight Zone twist. You all know those things are here to stay.    I would have preferred a dark ending, like Darabont's in the car, but for real, without the schoolyard \\"gotcha.\\" Think of a Tarantino ending here, oh yes.    Tell me a story. But please, however outlandish it is, try to make it feel real.

B000FS9FCQ|5.0|V for Vendetta is one of the very rare movies that offer consistent solutions to reach individual freedom as well as collective freedom.    Evey follows this path to freedom with the help of her master V. After days of suffering and major sacrifices, she starts to see behind the illusion.    The proposed path is interesting because it has nothing to do with the usual \\"elightenment recipes\\" like pyschedelic drugs, immediate mystical experience, blind faith or hermir-like excapes.     Just one quote about Evey's experience : V to Evey : \\"You found something else. In that cell you found something that mattered more to you than life. It was when they threatened to kill you unless you gave them what they wanted... you told them you'd rather die. You faced your death, Evey. You were calm. You were still.\\"    Meanwhile V works on a broader plan : helping the whole population to get rid of a fascist control.     Here again, the interesting thing is that the solution has nothing to do with the usual revolutionary \\"modus operandi\\" : no violence, no new regime as cynical as the previous regime, no brainwashing of the masses, no civil war.    Well, I won't give you all the details so if you want to know them you'll have to watch the movie and I really think that in thoses growing fascist time it's really worth it !

B000U618C8|5.0|I've read reviews claiming \\"In Our Nature\\" is merely \\"Veneer Part 2\\" and sees Gonzalez re-hashing a winning formula. I feel these accusations are a little unjust. \\"Veneer\\" showcased such a wonderfully unique singer/songwriter sound that it would be hard and pointlessly dangerous to move too far adrift. Unfortunately the classic sophomore criticism is apparent thanks to this inimitable style; grand expectations of something new and better become rife. I feel that while the overall sound is undeniably similar, the album is in no way the same. It touches on different subjects and evokes new moods and atmospheres.<br /><br />As I said earlier, \\"In Our Nature\\" provides idiosyncratic Gonzalez songs, such as \\"How Low\\" and \\"Killing For Love\\", both giving early insight that Gonzalez is not about to blow your mind with a wild direction change. However, \\"How Low\\" and the second song \\"Down The Line\\" do present a subtle progression, and one that I feel is central to \\"In Our Nature\\". \\"Veneer\\" was centred mostly on Gonzalez's personal problems - notably broken relationships. \\"How Low\\" and especially \\"Down The Line\\" are the first of many songs which see Gonzalez stepping back and viewing social dynamics; making a variety of observations, mostly cutting and ominous, but ultimately positive and hopeful, emphasised by the \\"Down The Line\\" chanting climax of \\"Don't let the darkness eat you up\\". This is continued throughout with songs such as \\"Killing For Love\\" and \\"Cycling Trivialities\\", the latter ends the album on a poignant yet sincerely depressing vibe, attacking the ultimately trivial and futile self-centred nature in himself and those around him- \\"So, where's this leaving me? Recycling trivialities\\". This culmination sees a solution to the building tensions and problems depicted throughout the album. It may be a dark and ultimately depressing solution, but in a strange way it gives a wonderful sense of completion, of almost peace within the dark resolve.<br /><br />Special mention must go to the cover of Massive Attack's \\"Teardrop\\" for being the best song Gonzalez has produced. \\"Heartbeats\\" was a grand success of a cover, but for me \\"Teardrop\\" is just sublime. The original is a beautiful piece, atmospheric and moving, yet Gonzalez transcends it. This song just has to be heard. My other standout track I am yet to mention is \\"Fold\\", which showcases an irresistible main melody that completely captures me.<br /><br />Overall this is another superb album from Jos&eacute; Gonzalez, continuing his sound and style, but addressing new problems and forging new atmospheres and moods. It contains a number of songs which I feel to be his best work to date, such as the pinnacle \\"Teardrop\\", the striking \\"Fold\\" and the powerful climax of \\"Cycling Trivialities\\".

B000QUCNP4|5.0|In what may very well be David Fincher's best film since `Se7en' the audience is taken on a dark and mysterious ride through the lives of a select few, from policemen to reporters to cartoonists who all have one, and really only one, thing in common, the Zodiac Killer.  Now, having just seen `American Gangster' this past weekend and just now having seen `Zodiac' for the first time I feel that I can safely dispel all comparisons.  Personally I don't think the two are comparable, although I've seen many judge one off the other.  I won't say now which I feel is the better film since at this point they are both in my top five of the year, but I will say that each in their own rights deserves the attention they have been garnered.  Hopefully Oscar buzz will carry this early release to the finish line for it deserves a slew of nominations, Best Picture not absent from that list.<br /><br />The film is based off of the novels written by Robert Graysmith chronicling the investigations of the many Zodiac murders which started in the mid-60's.  With that said the film revolves around Graysmith himself and his unhealthy obsession with the killer and discovering his identity.  Graysmith was not a detective, not a police officer; in fact he wasn't even a reporter.  Graysmith was a cartoonist with a knack for puzzles who just so happened to crack one or two sent by the killer and thus started his freefall into dangerous territory.<br /><br />The Zodiac Killer took many lives, most of which were not by means of a gun or knife, and that is what this movie exploits.  This movie is less about the people The Zodiac murdered and more about the people who suffered greatly while attempting to find him.  Robert Graysmith, Inspector David Toschi and reporter Paul Avery all lost years of their lives to this case, self inflicted as it may have been.  They lost family, respect, jobs...all in the pursuit of a killer who, to this day, has never been captured.  Graysmith says to his wife Melanie that he needs to know who The Zodiac is, he needs to look him in the eyes and know that it is him.  I'm forced to ask myself, why?  I mean, is it really worth wrecking your whole life just to track down someone who couldn't care less about you?<br /><br />Maybe it is.<br /><br />Maybe it was.<br /><br />The one thing that I admired about `Zodiac' and `American Gangster' as well (I will write my review for `American Gangster' soon...most likely when the DVD is released) is that they both take their time.  They are not in a rush to tell a story; in fact they slow things down and make sure that they tell the story right.  They breathe life into their characters so that the audience can feel a connection.  So, I assume you can tell from that statement that this is not a short movie.  It's slow paced which adds to the overall feeling of the film.  It's eerie, it's creepy, it's dramatic...it's here to instill paranoia (`American Gangster' is slow paced as well but not for the same reasons...it is far from eerie).  David Fincher does a fantastic job of understanding the mood he is creating and embellishing upon it.  It reminds me of the feeling I got while watching Bennett Miller's film `Capote'.<br /><br />Fincher also lucked out with his electric cast.  Everyone participating in this film does a fantastic job, none more so than Robert Downey Jr., who in my humble opinion should be frontrunner for the Oscar (but alas, he's not).  Downey Jr. beautifully fleshes out Paul Avery, giving him charm and charisma and drive and then masterfully deteriorates him so that the audience can see the man The Zodiac left behind.  Mark Ruffalo also delivers excellence as David Toschi.  He has such fervor, such motivation until his everything starts to crumble and he seeks to escape.  What is beautiful to see in each of these performances is that while both men try and distance themselves from The Zodiac we can see that it is within this enigma that they truly flourish for when Graysmith approaches both men with the subject their eyes ignite, even if they turn him away.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal is effective here as Graysmith, but he gets lost a bit amidst such an eclectic cast.  Robert Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo chew so much scenery that Gyllenhaal struggles at times to remain the center of attention.  He's a fine actor and is slowly by surely being molded into a great one, but it becomes apparent when placed beside better actors with sufficient material that he is still out of their league.<br /><br />The long list of supporting players is impressive as well.  I love me some Chloe Sevigny, and even though her role is a small one she is supremely effective.

Robert Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo chew so much scenery that Gyllenhaal struggles at times to remain the center of attention.  He's a fine actor and is slowly by surely being molded into a great one, but it becomes apparent when placed beside better actors with sufficient material that he is still out of their league.

B000N6TX1I|2.0|This movie is a waste. I am a fan of the novel, but not the movie version. It is a poor representation of the message contained within the original work. It had potential, but potential that was unfullfilled. Skip it!

B00005ATQD|4.0|I dont know what others saw, but I saw this film as a glimpse into the bored AND decedent rich-the powers in control of the world that use dark magic-satanism-as  both entertainment, to keep the group united by terrible rituals-and perhaps their positions of power. This theme was bracketed by the Nicole/Cruise story-but the few minutes-the core of the film-a bit too brief, showed what those in control-I hate the overused word Illuminati- do for sadistic ritualistic entertainment.  EYES WIDE SHUT-in not just a clever, oblique  title for the film-it is a metaphor or what goes on in the VERY upper class cabals-those who control the World;  The hedonistic rituals with identities cloaked was no run o the mill Country Club party-It was  about human sacrifice;  Do you think the secrecy, the girl  Mandy-who repaid her debt to Dr Hartford, her warnings of great danger  and her offering her life as sacrifice-was just some dungeons and dragon game carried a little too far, that Cruise happened to crash?  And her being found dead by \\"OD\\"?  Dr. Zeiegler sums it up with a 'you dont want to know what it was really going on-or who was in attendance', which he implied would give Bill or anyone nightmares.  The pianist Nick was obviously roughed up-but who can say-did he really get put on a plane to Seattle, or is he at the bottom of the Hudson River? I dont believe the cabal would scold him with -\\"youll never be invited to our gatherings again!\\"   and let him go. He betrayed them. I think the only reason Cruise was allowed to leave-wasnt just because Mandy volunteered to take his place-it was more likely Zeigler put in a plea for him- or he would be alongside Nick-at the bottom of the Hudson river-or worse.  Nearly every one of  Kubricks films in some way exposes the reality, or draws away the   veil of what we perceive and are told how the world really operates.  Dont think that it didnt cross my mind that Kubricks death- and his expose-however brief-of the power structure-were unrelated. A reach, perhaps but worth thinking about.
B00004C4L6|5.0|Update- March 2, 2012<br /><br />Wow did I REALLY submit a review for this album over 4 years ago?  Anyway I was actually wrong about something.  Despite how unbelievably chaotic and dangerous the music of Electronic Meditation is, I'm actually finding with repeated listens that it's not only listenable but actually, dare I say it, *melodic*.  I'm not even kidding.  You'd know if I was kidding because I'd say it and... I'm not.  Nope, April Fools Day isn't for another month either so you can't say I'm playing a prank!<br /><br />\\"Journey Through a Burning Brain\\" has some EXTREMELY good guitar playing with a strong psychedelic leaning and instant connections to Pink Floyd's \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" with some emotional (believe it or not) guitar trickery somewhere in the middle.  What makes the song work so well is around the 3-minute mark when the organs get REALLY thick as the other instruments take a back seat, and it sounds like a thing of absolute heavenly beauty to me.  The guitar solo afterwards is really fantastic as well because it reminds me of Jefferson Airplane, another band I love.  \\"Cold Smoke\\" surprisingly reveals several layers of melody as well.  I LOVE the middle section in particular that sounds like it would fit in on Van Der Graaf Generator's VERY underrated debut called \\"The Aerosol Grey Machine\\" and one song in particular called \\"Octopus\\".  Listen to the middle section from both \\"Cold Smoke\\" and \\"Octopus\\" and tell me there's really a difference.  I love both songs quite a bit so my comparison is only just that- to compare two songs that sound identical to me.<br /><br />Let me put it another way- BOTH jams totally remind me of mad-dashing my way through a Castlevania game whipping candles!  Or perhaps a more accurate comparison, witnessing Scooby Doo and Shaggy running through a haunted hallway of a castle!  Oh and the guitar jam?  It's *unbelievable*.  AGAIN -just like the rest of the song- it's melodic and I'm not even joking!  Anyway these two songs ALONE take up most of the album, and considering how melodic they sound to me now... yeah, Electronic Meditation is certainly on the melodic side.<br /><br />Is there a way to define THIS album?  I thought Pink Floyd and King Crimson were the only experimental bands from back in the day.  Nope, these guys are just as insanely atmospheric and experimental.  Actually other experimental artists include Frank Zappa, Henry Cow, David Bowie, Yes, and Gentle Giant.<br /><br />The rest of the material is only slightly less exciting.  \\"Genesis\\" contains ship horn sound effects leading into a speedy flute solo that turns melodic before its conclusion.  \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" is a *wonderful* 4-minute guitar jam.  \\"Resurrection\\" has eerie and inspiring organs and German vocals before turning into the same ordeal that begins \\"Genesis\\".<br /><br />Sometimes when I listen to this music I get the feeling the members of Tangerine Dream were influenced by the Doors more quiet and atmospheric bits, and of course, Pink Floyd's legendary Piper at the Gates of Dawn and A Saucerful of Secrets albums.  It's like a blend between the two.  An album well worth checking out.  I get the feeling the band Yes was listening very closely to what these guys were doing for their Tales from Topographic Oceans album.  You want music that's completely warped and in its own little world?  You found the right album.  Electronic Meditation it is.  Electronic Meditation is really underappreciated by just about everyone who thinks it's mediocre or terrible.  It's not.  Far from it.  The keyboards, guitars and drums are simply being performed in a really twisted way, that's all.  A wonderful album.

I'm just glad their around,Myself personally ,I would like to see all origins for superheroes/villains ,to be formatted around the original stories, this makes it better for the ones who read from the beginning,and know the true nature of their origins, parts 2and3 of said movies can be where ideas can be bent. Watch what they do to THOR, because they think no one is paying attention to the details, of the character . I hope trial of the gods would be put in with a true scripting of how thor became.

1426458975|5.0|This book is oft' given the quite unfair burden of being compared to CS Lewis' Mere Christianity. They are however very dissimilar.In so far as developing a practicum understanding of the Christian worldview, Lewis should probably be recommended.  In so far as dealing with overtly intellectual issues (the collapse of idealism, the belittlement of epistemology, and other modern notions), GK Chesterton should be recommend. Chesterton was confronting the Modernist movement head on. His interest lie with the modernist tendency to think of truth as unknowable or as merely personal preference. It's a stunningly apt response to such trains of thought. If you are in an intellectually driven sphere, GK has a lot to offer. His work is well able to drive people deeper into their intellectual constructed worlds, but I think the sane individual will opt instead to use it as an opportunity to understand the greatness, the vastness, and the utter reality of the world.

B000VR824S|5.0|No I didn't go to the concert like some of the other reviewers but I loved what I saw and heard. If I could I would give it more than 5 stars. All these performers at one gig! Only Clapton has what it takes to get that many performers at one time. Sure a lot of the stuff may have hit the cutting room floor but what made the dvd was incredible. If they put everything on the dvd there would be so many disks no one could afford it. Sure there were some performers that arnt my favorites but thats got to happen with something this big. Now that I have seen the whole thing the next time I watch it I will use the fast forward button to skip through a few of the performers. Or Not!!! I would loved to have seen more of Johnny Winter and many of the others but thats the way it goes. Every thing I did see deserves they highest rating I can give it.
B0002JJBZY|5.0|From the packaging, right down to the details of the DVD menus when you play one of these disks, this boxed set truly captures the looks, feels, and even sounds of the TOS series.  If you never got to see the old series as it looked when it was first released on TV, now's the best shot you'll get! These are the complete episodes, all 'cut' content is back into the series here. (Several times over the years they selectively removed tiny bits of each episode to make time for still MORE commercials).  And it's ALL here, including 'The Cage', as it was originally intended to be released, as well as 'The Menagerie' as it was eventually aired.  Buy this set, sit back in your Captain's chair, and let the disks take you where no man has gone before. It's a great trip, one well worth reliving. :)
0446577391|5.0|This is a \\"must read\\" for any Baldacci (or Camal Club) fan.  It is almost a seamless continuation of \\"Collectors.\\" In my opinion, \\"Stone Cold\\" is the feel-good book of 2007, ...especially if you detest the  worthless elected and appointed 'official' bums in D.C., think Homeland Security is a joke, and have no use for casino types.
0694003611|5.0|I've been reading this book to my son since he was little bitty. He's 19 months now and still loves it.  It's smooth, soothing reading.  Great bedtime story.  I've memorized the book and will recite it to him when he's fussy and it still works!
0143038419|1.0|I really wanted to like this book, but she came off as so self-obsessed, selfish, vain, (you get the idea). I understand that the intention was for the author to chronicle her life on her spiritual journey, but she writes in wincing detail her crying jags in the bathroom, how she couldn't understand her husband's anger when she left him for another man and why he couldn't make things easy for her by agreeing to a \\"friendly\\" divorce....    And it goes on from there. Instead of getting insight in another person's quest for spiritual identify, it was all clouded with the \\"me, me, me\\" theme and distracted this reader from the intention of the book.
1594481717|5.0|I can't imagine, especially if you are at mid-life, that you feel your job is really secure. You may even have a game plan for what to do should the pink slip find you. Well, if your plan included dusting off the ol' resume and going on the internet, it's time to rework the playbook. Dan Pink's book makes a compelling, albeit indirect, case for changing one's career management strategy from merely marketing transferable skills to offering a compelling and unique promise of value.     The premise of this book is that the Information Age, which was based on the Left Brain qualities of logic, sequence, and analysis, is giving way to a new Conceptual Age dominated by the simultaneous, contextual, big-picture capabilities of the right brain. In this new Conceptual Age, careers that rely most heavily on left brain capabilities are at risk of being automated, off-shored, or may simply produce outcomes that fall short of increased demand for products and services with an aesthetic and emotional appeal.     According to Pink, the key to delivering value in the Conceptual Age is to engage in work that involves high concept or high touch abilities. High concept includes creating artistic or emotional beauty or appeal, detecting patterns or opportunities, and producing a novel synthesis of seemingly unrelated ideas. High concept includes ability to empathize and grasp subtleties human interaction, find joy in oneself and others, and pursue purpose and meaning. High concept and high touch are right-brain directed capabilities that rely on six senses: design, story, symphony, empathy, play, and meaning.     Although Pink's book is not a career management book, the six senses seem to align well with career management using a personal branding approach; specifically:     - Design: going beyond the utility of your skill set to its significance and emotional appeal;     - Symphony: considering how your combined competencies and attributes contribute to your unique promise of value;- Story: crafting messages to clearly communicate what you offer;     - Empathy: building a network of mutual benefit with others;     - Joy: identifying work you love where you can be yourself;     - Meaning: making a difference in the lives of the people you serve.     Of course, integrating these capabilities into managing you career is just the beginning. Increasingly, I believe, these capabilities will be the drivers for innovation and stand-out accomplishment in whatever position you have. And stand-out accomplishment demonstrates the unique and compelling value you deliver -- which, in turn, moves your career forward.     I highly recommend this book for the perspective it can provide on proactively managing your career.
0735619670|5.0|Often called \\"'The Joy of Cooking' for coding\\", Code Complete is an excellent book that doesn't say HOW TO code, but is ABOUT coding.  Considerations with project size and complexity, coding style, comments, testing strategies, even developer communication are all touched upon.<br /><br />Many things won't click with people who don't have at least a year or two of development under their belt, but for any kind of programmer, this book contains many gems that are worth referencing for years to come.

B000AMJC2K|4.0|I was hesitant to purchase this product after reading the reviews and weight my monitor. I use a ViewSonic 20-inch that weights 19 pounds and is about 2 1/2 inches deep.    All the \\"hinges\\" worked great and supported the weight of my monitor--except for the tilt mechanism. However, with the use of one of the bolts that came with the arm, I was able to very easily jam it into the appropriate angle (tilted very slightly upward).    Setup took about 30 minutes, but I'm definitely pleased with the purchase.
B000Y179KO|3.0|After all these years, expectations were high.  Did they meet those expectations? Not really...this is not a classic on the level of Hotel California or The Long Run.  Having said that, as many others have pointed out here, 12 bucks for 2 discs is a good bargain, and there are plenty of good songs here.  The second disc is much slower than the first, to the point where I wondered whether editing a few songs out and bringing it down to one disc may have been a better overall album (better pacing, in particular).  While the Joe Walsh songs are fun, Don Henley gets a bit serious and heavy-handed at times (and this is coming from someone with major liberal sensibilities).  On the other hand, their vocal harmonies remain pristine and unmatched and when they have those harmonies really going (like on the beautiful opening song), I swear I would probably listen to them sing the phone book if they wanted to! This is certainly a respectable album and I am hoping they continue to record together in the future.
B000WGZGNS|4.0|I attended the Beyonce concert when she came to Denver this past August and was blown away! This woman entertains! I was worried that the DVD wouldn't be able to fully capture the excitement of the show, but it does that and more. There are few women who can command a stage for two hours.    The disc opens with Beyonce asking the audience if they are \\"...ready to be entertained?!\\" She doesn't disappoint as she launches into \\"Crazy in Love\\" and the sexy \\"Freakum Dress\\". She holds court as she gives you the full range of her catalogue: first some of her more popular solo material, then her work with former group-mates Destiny's Child, and finally more material from her newest release. Performed live, all of these songs sound fresh, when on record some of the material can seem kind of dated (i.e. 'Bug-a boo', No No No).               My only problems with the disc / concert were few. The addition of 'Flaws and All' detracts from the excitement of the show as Beyonce's vocal histrionics and simulated tears add nothing to the performance. We all know that Beyonce has a good voice, but she tends to over sing on 'Flaws and All' and 'Dangerously in Love'. As a performer, she is decidedly more Tina Turner than Whitney Houston and she should embrace that. The great thing about that is that she is well on her way to being a great performer in the same way as Tina Turner because she totally gives you all of herself in these two hours. The only other part of the DVD that was upsetting is that there are no extras on it at all.         In all, this is an excellent purchase for the Beyonce novice or even a longtime fan. Though here in Denver we weren't treated to the guest appearance by Jay Z (of course), I am otherwise completely satisfied with this show. I look forward to more performances by this very talented young woman in the future!
0765315246|5.0|This book is an amazing read. Scalzi really blew me away with it. While the idea of a hostile universe vs. the earthlings isnt new, his take on it is fresh and inventive.    You come to really care about the characters, and being a book about future warfare, some do die. Without diving into spoilers, a friend found one death so moving, she cried.    A great book for any science fiction fan.
B000SUKPKM|2.0|There is an old saying that could well be applied to the Goo Goo Dolls decision to redo Name, if it's not broke don't fix it.  Name was one of the Goo's strongest songs, a very well produced pop ballad.  The new version of Name sounds sloppy and tired.  So why mess with it?  So fans can get the original on volume 2?  This is disgusting and pointless.  Perhaps a consensus of songs from the fans should be taken before any greatest hits album is ever assembled.
B000PMG9SK|5.0|The 5 stars is for the album itself on this and the original - the opus Blind Guardian put out that many have come to know as perhaps one of their best if not their best. If you've already heard this album then you know what I'm talking about - Blind Guardian with the sophisticated power metal sound unique with medieval like melodies which fits nice with the theme of Middle Earth in the whole album, after all it is a concept album. Memorable tracks like \\"Into The Storm\\" and \\"Mirror Mirror\\" are fan favorites at their shows, some of their most well known songs are here. You'll get the same music from the original on this remastered version.    The thing is...Nightfall didn't really need a remaster because the quality of the music and loudness was already on par with modern metal albums and there's nothing wrong with the production either. The difference is just the extra track \\"Harvest of Sorrow\\" and revamped album artwork, linernotes, and fancier fonts for the lyrics as goes for all of the Blind Guardian remastered series. If you're new to Blind Guardian and you don't own any of their albums, the remaster of Nightfall is a good place to start, but if you're satisfied with what you can find easily in stores and something that isn't imported then just get the original version. Highly recommended - 5 stars.
B000VNMMRA|5.0|It has been way too long since John McClane has graced the big screen, so I was apprehensive when this film came out. Especially when I saw it was rated PG-13 and directed by the same guy that did Underworld (don't get me wrong, I loved Underworld, but it is a totally different type of movie than Die Hard). Needless to say I was pleasantly suprised. Bruce Willis is still great as the lead character, and Timothy Olyphant is a great villain. The PG-13 didn't hurt the film when I saw it in theatres, but the Unrated cut is great. The added blood and profanity are what fans of the franchise have come to expect (and enjoy). So this DVD is an answer to prayers...well for those of us who pray for more violence and profanity in our movies.
1878424602|5.0|This book was one of the first I ever read on my own quest to understand life and to learn use my own power to create the life that I truly desired. Deepak Chopra is at his best here, as he succinctly gives excellent teachings on how to truly create the life of your dreams. My absolute favorite part is where he talks about \\"pure potentiality\\" - the reality that there is nothing but potential in life. This teaching in itself will help so many others, as it allows people to understand the basic truth that we are not preprogrammed to live a certain \\"fated\\" life - but rather, we have the ability to be and do anything that we dream of. Anything is possible for you - this book is an excellent guide to helping you to truly know that!
B000F9RB8A|5.0|I love this movie. Blu-ray disc includes many audio and subtittle tracks. Picture quality higher than SD, not that noticeable on my 19\\" 720p though... for 10$, (2 for 1) great buy.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|The blurbs about this being a wonderful movie are all true. The artistry in this cartoon is excellent, really excellent. But most excellent is director Bird's unerring sense of story. We saw this in the movies and have now bought and viewed the DVD and intend to view it again every year or so. It's a family favorite. Amusing, and touching at the end, with a nifty ending, it's engaging and charming. Highly recommended!<br /><br />(If you're one of those people who doesn't like cartoon movies, you are -- there is not other word for it! -- an idiot. It's pretty much impossible to watch this, or any of Bird's previous efforts, and not enjoy it. Impossible.)

B000VDBD6Q|5.0|The Complete Sherlock Holmes, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle<br /><br />These 1,122 pages contain the authorized text of every Sherlock Holmes story ever written. The copyrights to these stories expired around 1972 so any writer can appropriate the characters in new fiction. Yet no one has been able to equal, let alone surpass, A.C. Doyle in world-wide popularity. Has anyone analyzed these stories to understand their wide-spread appeal? Erle Stanley Gardner and Agatha Christie wrote more novels but were not as popular. One reason is the short stories about Sherlock Holmes were more amenable to wide distribution as in school books on literature. (Chesterton's short stories had a religious bent.) Their classic restraint made them preferable to the stories of Hammett and Chandler. Novels written for 19th century adults often became stories for 20th century children (as Mark Twain). [One technical problem is that one volume is less handy than two or three volumes.]<br /><br />The introduction by Christopher Morley tells of his admiration for these stories. The character of Sherlock Holmes was inspired by the famous Dr. Joseph Bell of the Edinburgh Infirmary whose diagnostic skills startled his patients and pupils. The name \\"Holmes\\" was homage to Oliver Wendell Holmes who first warned about practices that caused \\"puerperal fever\\". \\"Sherlock\\" was a common Irish name, Doyle's strike against prejudice. Doyle often fought against unjust convictions and for his other beliefs. Chesterton's comment about \\"a man who believes in nothing winds up believing in anything\\" was aimed at Doyle. He went from a Catholic to an agnostic to a believer in a spirit world. Aging can affect a person's mind and beliefs.<br /><br />There are four novels and five collections of short stories. The novels are: \\"A Study in Scarlet\\", \\"The Sign of Four\\", \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\", and \\"The Valley of Fear\\". The short stories are the \\"Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\\" (12 stories), the \\"Memoirs of SherlockHolmes\\" (11 stories), \\"The Return of Sherlock Holmes\\" (13 stories), \\"His Last Bow\\" (8 stories), and \\"The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes\\" (12 stories). There are probably more books about Sherlock Holmes than about A. C. Doyle. Aside from legal considerations, it is easier to handle finite fiction than complex real life. Has anyone written books about \\"Hercule Poirot\\" or \\"Perry Mason\\"? The \\"James Bond\\" series goes on in new novels and action films but they are not as popular as the originals. Even fictional characters have a life-span.

0385510454|5.0|This book was very good. It was the first John Girsham book I have read. I like the way he put in the italian because I am currently learning spanish and many of the words were similar. If unable to understand the Italian he writes what the words mean in English if they are even the slightest bit important.
B000O77SRC|5.0|I re-watched Die Hard before seeing Live Free or Die Hard, the fourth installment in this series.  There are many parallels from the first movie, John doesn't get along with his wife becomes problems with his daughter, save the wife becomes save the daughter, the developing relationship with the LA cop becomes the computer nerd, but the fourth movie just isn't as good.  Maybe it's the bad guys.  We see them up close and personal in this movie; we get to know them.  Hans has the same tailor as Takagi.  In the fourth movie, we don't know them enough to like them or despise them.  The first Die Hard is still the best.

0060090383|5.0|Wow! This book was great from beginning to end! It had plenty of laugh-out-loud moments despite the fact that it dealt with a serious issue.     I highly recommend. Waaaaaaaaay better than \\"Anybody Out There?\\"
B000HEWEE4|5.0|For those who are looking for a normal Sandra Bullock romantic comedy in the manner of \\"Miss Congeniality,\\" then this would be the wrong movie for you. If you're the type that has to analyze every part of a movie and make sure that it all makes sense, you're looking in the wrong direction.    If you're looking for a story about something that could truly be called love, and not lust, then this the perfect movie.    Nearly any romantic movie that is out there is filled with sex or innuendo, and the plot usually follows the line of the guy sees the girl, thinks she's hot, goes through a series of misadventures, and they end up telling each other \\"I love you,\\" and having sex within five minutes.    \\"The Lake House\\" is a refreshing breath of fresh air after those movies. They meet each other completely by an accident (or time warp, whatever you want to call it). In fact, they don't even meet until months after they begin corresponding.    I just finished watching the movie for the second time. I rarely buy movies, preferring to go through Netflix, but this was one movie I had to own. Even though  knew how the movie progressed and ended up, I still had to cry. This is the first movie I have cried at all year.    Besides, when was the last time you saw a romantic movie rated PG? It is very hard to find a romantic movie that is also perfectly clean. It's a movie you will love, and that your kids can see. Indeed, you should encourage your children to watch a movie that doesn't think that love is based on how you look, but on how you think.    It's a movie based on faithfulness in love, even when it seems impossible.
B000VLE3IS|3.0|Over the past 7 or 8 years, record companies have adopted a way of thinking that basically boils down to louder = better. Many new albums have been ruined because they are \\"mastered\\" too loud. Rush's \\"Vapor Trails\\" is a great example of this.    For the non technical folks, mastering is the process by which a finished, mixed tape of an artist's song is then put through a series of refinements to make the sound a little more uniform for all listening situations. It is also at that stage that the \\"master\\" is created from which all copies are then produced.    In the early days of CD and digital sound, the process of converting analog sound to a digital signal was not as good as it is now. Also, coming out of the age of vinyl, where too loud a sound on vinyl could cause the needle to jump, CD's tended to be mastered about the same volume as vinyl. The CD is capable of volume levels that are louder than vinyl.    But, rather than use technology to create a better sounding product, the record companies took a perspective that louder = better = more sales. In other words, the louder the product is, the more people will notice it.    The problem for those of us who enjoy music is that by making CD's a whole lot  louder, we are also losing dynamics and dimension. Music is by nature, supposed to have peaks of loudness. There needs to be contrast. A visual representation of what we should be hearing versus what we are getting out of newer CD's would be aptly demonstrated IF I BEGAN TYPING IN ALL CAPS. THERE IS NO CONTRAST BETWEEN LOUD AND soft.    So, with Led Zeppelin's \\"Mothership\\" we are now getting louder music at the expense of dynamics. Jimmy Page remastered the entire Zeppelin catalog in 1991 and did a great job of using the technology available at that time. Technology exists now that could expand and sweeten the work that Jimmy did, BUT NO - THE MATERIAL HAD TO BE MADE MUCH LOUDER in order to be more competitive in today's market.    Competitive with what? I don'tknow. It's Led Zeppelin for crying out loud!    I really wish Jimmy would have taken a more active role in this new remaster job. (Yes, it does say he produced the tracks. He did - years ago. Producing is completely different from mastering - check the 90's CDs where they additionally credit \\"remastering\\" to Jimmy Page and George Marino. Jimmy was not involved in the remastering this time around. It was done by John Davis)    Listen to \\"Trampled Underfoot\\" Listen to the Jimmy Page remaster from the early 90's and then the \\"Mothership\\" remaster. Notice how the swirling guitar at the end of the keyboard solo seems to fade up, up, UP in loudness on the Jimmy Page remaster (it was mixed that way in 1975). On The \\"Mothership\\" the fade up is less dramatic. THAT'S BECAUSE YOU LOSE THOSE DYNAMICS WHEN MUSIC IS MASTERED TOO LOUD. Notice how when Bonzo crashes in to his cymbals on \\"Mothership\\", the sound of the cymbals is breaking up. That's because the sound is so loud, even the CD can't reproduce it. That's called clipping, basically. That's where the peak is cut off because the signal is too loud. Imagine a mountain top just under a cloud. If you raise the mountain, you would lose sight of the peak in the cloud. That's a visual for what happens to sound.    To hear how truly incredible a CD can sound, check out \\"Love\\" by The Beatles, the Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab version of Yes \\"Fragile\\", or the Tom Scholz remasters of \\"Boston\\" or \\"Don't Look Back\\".    Send Atlantic a message and avoid \\"Mothership\\". Tell them we are tired of having OUR MUSIC PRESENTED TO US LIKE THIS. By the way, the abomination that is Rush \\"Vapor Trails\\" just happens to be on...Atlantic.    D. Duran
B000XT2LMS|4.0|Excellent watch for the money.  I bought mine through Amazon about six months ago and am very satisfied by this watch. I think I paid $54 for it then and the shipping was very quick.  This is my first automatic and I love the fact that I never have to replace a battery.  It has a simple elegance that reminds me of WWII British and American issue watches.  It runs a little fast (probable gains a minute a week) but this is not a big issue.
B000VNMMQG|4.0|I must admit that I didn't know who William Wilberforce was before I saw this film, nor did I know that the composer John Newton had once been a slave trader.  It's the kind of historical knowledge that more people should become familiar with.    I was impressed with WW's commitment to social justice, more compassion for animals, and improvements in health care and education.  Ioan Gruffudd does a nice job in the role of WW, as does Albert Finney, who plays his mentor, John Newton.  Ciaran Hinds and Toby Jones are at the top of their game as the main opposition in the House of Commons.  It would have been more effective to have more slaves featured so we could hear their point of view; as it is, only one former slave gets to say anything about his horrific experiences.  Overall, however, this is a story worth getting to know.
0451196716|4.0|This was my first Stephen King book I've read, the whole idea of the plot itself is scary enough, to think if this was a actual situation you wonder how it would play out    My favorite part of this story is you actually care about the characters, I've read countless books where you get to the point you really don't... I could not stop reading this book and its very interesting seeing the relationships built with people they are competing agaisnt    The very end left a bit something to be desired, I'm not sure what I was hoping for but overall was very pleased with the book, high recommend it to others
B000000OPW|5.0|Most music I listen to nowadays is from the last five years, seven or eight at the most. One of the few select artists I still listen to after fifteen years is Siouxsie & the Banshees. I discovered them in my freshman year in college. TINDERBOX is my personal favorite Siouxsie album. The fact that it has my personal favorite Siouxsie song \\"Cities in Dust\\" nakes it all the more sweeter. There are two versions of \\"Cities in Dust\\", one of them is an extended version. \\"The Sweetest Chill\\" is another favorite song of mine simply for Siouxsie's distinct vocals. The swirling guitar riffs and haunting melodies also makes the song stand out with me. Another great song is \\"This Unrest\\". The disjointed melodies are a bit unsettling but in a good way. The song would be perfect in a chase scene in a horror movie. It has the scare elements in the melodies. Every song on the album is great. I can listen to TINDERBOX without hitting the forward button. TINDERBOX is a modern classic that has remained a permanent place in my stereo.
B000GFLKF8|1.0|The story is very ludicrous because it never spends time building the characters ... which takes talent on the part of the director. Spike ! What were you thinking ?    The dialogs are lame (perhaps a reflection of our lack of emphasis on education in the US). Older movies have such powerful dialogs that make you say \\"Wow ! I must use that sometime !\\".    One star for Inside Man.
0765357151|4.0|1. Presentation: *4* I really didn't like the book cover. Not that I don't love Will Smith (I do and can't wait to go watch the movie!), but in book format it's very jarring to see him on the cover and then read how the author describes Robert Neville. So I made a little book cover so I wouldn't be forced to see the incongruity everytime I picked it up. It's a better poster picture than a book cover.<br /><br />Another thing was the front cover doesn't tell you that it's a collection of short stories. Which I knew but then forgot when I got the book. The table of contents made it seem more like chapters then new stories. So the ending of LEGEND lost its main point for me since I went straight into the next story not realizing LEGEND had already ended. User error, granted, but it would have been nice to have a little more warning of the short stories.<br /><br />2. Content: *5* Awesome. LEGEND was by far the best of the group. I wish it would have explained more of HOW the tides changed towards the end instead of summing it up in one word. But that's just a preference. It was well written and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I just wonder how they're going to stretch the movie to an hour and a half and if they'll keep the ending the same. Or most of the middle even. The rest of the stories were a little strange but not bad. I wish some of them had a little more content or explaination, but they were interesting little points to ponder in their own.<br /><br />Overall: Definately would recommend this book, regardless of the cover.
0385338082|2.0|How shall I round off my 2.5 star rating? I'll round it down, since so many seem to have rounded it up!     In spite of the pink packaging that suggested it would be little more than girl talk for women, I bought the audio book for a buck in a second-hand store. I figured it could be a buck well spent for a long road trip.    And that much, it was. It did help pass the time on the road, although I would not normally pick something quite that light and quite that undeveloped. My single, highest accolade goes to the narrator. I give her a whopping 50 on a scale of ten, for her amazing reading of the various characters, proper enunciation, emphasis, conveyed meaning, etc. You rarely find this in a talking book, and it was a joy to be entertained by this voice. (The charming British accent is also a plus for many of us Americans.) The only demerit is for her rendition of Jack's dialog. The low, mono-toned, ominous-sounding voice for the leading male character is a big let-down compared to all the rest of the narration, and it only exacerbates the author's paucity of character-building for him.    I agree with others about the lack of character building. For someone as brilliant as Jack to fall for this rather scatter-brained young woman, he'd have to see something more in her than mere hints of possible gold nuggets behind her idiosyncrasies. As the story progresses [spoiler alert!], you see them move toward marriage without any hint of serious discussion. A lot seemed to depend on how she would take his revealing her secrets on TV and on how he would take her having told part of his secret to her girlfriends. In real life, by that point, you'd have both decided you wanted to explore where this might go, so that sorting out these things would be part of the process, not a possible deal-breaker at every step of the way. In high school, everything might depend on whether the boy passes you a note, or a girl lets you walk her home. But Jack is not only an adult, he's a successful entrepreneur, apparently very insightful. Their relationship should have been more adult and less high schoolish.     Further, what did she see in Jack? I didn't get the impression she's a gold digger, but I did get the impression her attraction was mainly the coincidence of their meeting (plane... office...), and the fact that she could date the head honcho. At best, she seems infatuated.     If you read lighter stuff now and then and don't mind filling in a lot of the lacking character as you go, then you might like this book at least as much as I did. But remember, I was a \\"captive audience\\" in my car with the talking book, and hearing the narrator was at least half the fun. Frankly, I can't imagine finishing this book, if I were sitting at home reading it by the fire--not because it's a bad book, but because there is so much to read and so little time; I think I'd set it aside for something better.
0743298039|5.0|This was a page turner!  I didn't want to put it down.  Slightly twisted but interesting nonetheless.
B000SZLSB2|5.0|I am a new James Blunt fan. When his hit song \\"You're Beautiful\\" hit the radio, I liked it at first and then quickly got so tired of it that I wrote James Blunt off as an artist I wanted to hear more from...(I know. Not fair to judge and artist by one song, but anyway) So, lo and behold a friend of mine lent me his latest CD to \\"try\\" and I was blown away. I LOVED every song and was surprised at the quality and content of the album. Great driving music, easy to listen to, quality thoughtful lyrics. Just go out and get this album already!!!
B000001FA4|5.0|Why are U2 making their legions of worldwide fans suffer through the excruciatingly awful sounding albums that remain on the market. None have yet to see a remaster job on the level of the new Joshua Tree reissue: Boy, October, War, The Unforgettable Fire, and Achtung Baby. Hell, even Rattle and Hum and the EP's Wide Awake and Under a Blood Red Sky need to be remastered from the original tapes (not just remixed from the existing stock). Am I the only one who would buy these? Soooo many lesser bands have had their entire catalogs reissued, why not one of the biggest selling bands in the world?   I'm not asking for vault-clearing excess, but I need to hear The Unforgettable Fire the way it was meant to be heard (some of the era's B-sides  would also be nice). Yes, I know many have made it on to the Greatest Hits CD's. This is U2 nearing it's creative peak (culminating with JT) and picking up again with Actung Baby. Get this CD out now, please. Stop making lackluster \\"new\\" records long enough to correct this grievous error, and possibly win some new fans in the process.
B000002UAX|5.0|ESSENTIAL ALBUM! This was actually the first Beatles album I ever got, I got it at its release. I suppose the very plainness of the cover is what attracted me, initially. I'm always in a quandary when faced choosing between this album & Abbey Road as to which is the best. Usually, Abbey Road wins out but it's still a win-win situation; this IS the Beatles, after all! The White Album is the only studio album by the Beatles that was, and is, two discs. This created a twofold (no pun intended) situation; it put a lot of good material on it but it also burdened it with some trash. Really, the only song I wish wasn't here would be \\"Revolution #9\\". Does anyone really listen to this so-called song? This album ranks in the top 10 best selling albums in history.    This was another #1 album by the guys from Liverpool. There weren't any singles released from the album though there could have been several. The album opens with \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\", a song that McCartney still performs in his tours. The chorus was a tribute to the Beach Boys. That's Paul playing drums on this one, not Ringo. This is one of the best songs on the album. This song then segues into \\"Dear Prudence\\", one of my favorite Lennon songs. John, Paul & George layered about six guitars to get the sound that they wanted. This song was written about Mia Farrow's sister, Prudence, who was on the same retreat to India that the Beatles were. Then comes \\"Glass Onion\\", a lot of people like this song but I don't care for it all. Then comes one of McCartney's ditties \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\", a song he wanted very much to be a hit. It's humorous & catchy, another song that fit the Lennon remark, \\"It's a song your granny would dig.\\" McCartney actually goofed singing th lyrics of the next to last verse & George Martin decided to go with it anyway. Then comes the short throwaway \\"Wild Honey Pie\\", fun but filler. Then we get an incredible flamenco-style acoustic guitar opening the song \\"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\\", very acidic & cynical lyrics by Lennon. Yoko Ono actually sings the line \\"Not when he look so fierce\\". Then comes the Harrison classic \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\". This definitely could have been a single. When Harrison first played this song for Lennon & McCartney, they almost literally turned their noses up at this song. They didn't want any part of it. That's Eric Clapton playing the lead guitar. Lennon & Harrison were actually at immense differences at the time when this album was recorded; Lennon refused to play on the four Harrison compositions on this album. \\"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\\" is one of those complex Lennon songs, it has multi-movements & time changes. It's loaded with imagery & is one of my favorite songs from the album.    \\"Martha My Dear\\" is an average song, but cute, that Paul wrote about his sheepdog. \\"I'm So Tired\\" is a good Lennon song that has some acerbic lyrics. \\"Blackbird\\" is a McCartney classic that he still performs. He was the only Beatle to play on this one. \\"Piggies\\" is a Harrison song that isn't anywhere near his best. \\"Rocky Raccoon\\" is another McCartney classic with a country twist to it; it's some of the best lyrics he has written. \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" was the first song on a Beatles album to be solely written by Ringo (the writing credit is actually his real name, Richard Starkey). It's similar to country music & completely dispensable. \\"Why Don't We Do It in the Road\\" is completely McCartney. He plays all the instruments on this one. It was recorded late after the scheduled session had ended & all the other Beatles had gone home. This was one of those things that added tension to the sessions & caused the other three to be very resentful toward McCartney. It's one of my favorites. There follow a typical McCartney ballad \\"I Will\\" that's average. Disc one closes with the moody Lennon composition \\"Julia\\", a song he had written in honor of his mother. Once again Lennon's lyrics are loaded with imagery.    Disc two opens with therocker \\"Birthday\\". Typically inane lyrics by McCartney but the song moves & could have been released as a single. Lennon's \\"Yer Blues\\" is next; it's an intense song that goes through different variations of the same riff. \\"Mother Nature's Son\\" is an acoustic number written by McCartney, once again he's the only Beatle on it. \\"Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except for Me and My Monkey\\" is the longest title in the Beatles canon. It's one of Lennon's best, it rocks hard & has a great bass riff near the end. \\"Sexy Sady\\" was written by Lennon & is really about the Maharishi that the Beatles went to see on their Indian retreat. One can tell that Lennon wasn't too crazy about the guy. \\"Helter Skelter\\" is one of the hardest rocking songs the Beatles would do; it comes very close to being heavy metal. This song would get some very sinister press because of some famous murders that would occur not long after the release of this album. \\"Long, Long, Long\\" is another Harrison composition that's not among his best, it has a very eerie ending. Then comes the original version of \\"Revolution\\". This was the way Lennon wanted to do it but George Martin convinced them to do a much speeded up version that became a hit single. I feel this slow version is the better version. \\"Honey Pie\\" is another McCartney ditty, a 'granny\\" song. \\"Savoy Truffle\\" is lone of Harrison's best songs; he wrote it about a box of candy. \\"Cry Baby Cry\\" is a great Lennon ballad but one he personally thought was garbage. It has unique lyric content & is one of his better efforts. The fragment at the end is a McCartney bit, \\"Can You Take Me Back\\" that was spliced on to the end of \\"Cry Baby Cry\\". Once again it's McCartney recording by himself after the rest of the band has gone home. There follows the avant-garde \\"Revolution #9\\", it's atrocious & is the one song that could & should be deleted. Does anyone really listen to this? Disc two closes with Lennon's \\"Good Night\\", vocal done by Ringo. Lennon told Martin towrite an arrangement for it making it sound like 'Hollywood'. Ringo is the only Beatle performing on this song.    This isn't actually a Beatles album. It's more like four solos albums with each Beatle playing with the same backing band. It's incredible that they put this album together with all the animosity that was going on between them.The vast majority of these songs were written while they were on their sojourn to India. The diversity of song styles here is incredible; there's big band, pop, rock, country, blues & ballads. That was always one of the best things about Beatles albums; one never knew what to expect of them but it was going to be good. Truly an amzing album!
B000000W5N|5.0|After listening to this whole album you will feel as though you've stepped into and walked through the rawness of life.  The music exposes you to real, raw human emotion with small slices of debauchery, vileness and perversion.  The album has such a humane earthiness about it by combining many different genres much of which originally was American Music such as; blues, gospel, jazz, country, bluegrass and rock.  To get this experience I described the whole album needs to be listened to in one sitting.    You can't look at Mick Jagger as a singer but rather as a deliverer.  He'll deliver the songs into your blood and bones making them teem with nastiness.  If you purposefully can't make out all the words you will get the feel and aura of each song.
B000WM725C|3.0|I was also skeptical about this curious CD...and the timing of it's release, here (hopefully) just before Archives volume I is a reality. We all know what a control freak NY is, and I feared that this would be \\"boot quality\\", but was pleasantly surprised that it has a decent sound to it.    Basically, it's a soundtrack for the concert film \\"Rust Never Sleeps\\", since their setlists are identical. On a positive note, though, it is not exactly the same as \\"Live Rust\\", with its inclusion of Thrasher and Welfare Mothers, not included on LR. Also, Live in San Fran avoids some of the editing snafus of LR, for example, Cortez the Killer is restored to its full length.    My advice is to stick with the DVD of \\"RNS\\", and skip this, unless you want to replace your copy of \\"LR' with Live in San Fran.    Save your money for Archives...it promises to be quite pricey!
B000LXHK2C|4.0|Admittedly, Russell Crowe is not known for his work in Romantic Comedies, which is why this film sank out of sight so quickly in the Theatres.  That it did so poorly in general release is a shame, as it is quite a good film - fun to watch, humorous, excellent performances, and a sweet ending.<br /><br />Most of the actors, aside from Crowe and Albert Finney, are French, and you'll hear a fair amount of dialog in French (usually with subtitles) from their characters: particularly wisecracks and mild sexual humor.<br /><br />The movie centers, naturally, on Crowe's character - Max - a cynical, aggressive and downright nasty Bond Trader on the London exchange who's only interests in life are booze, money and women - though not necessarily in that order.  Early in the film Max learns that his Uncle Henry (played by Albert Finney) has died and left his entire estate to Max - a Chateau and winery in France.<br /><br />Max, partly because of a furor caused by his recent manipulation of the bond market, and partly to get his hands on more cash, decides this would be a convenient time to travel to France and liquidate the old place as quickly as possible.  --- Of course, things don't work out quite as he planned!<br /><br />Through flashbacks with Uncle Henry and Max (as a young boy), we learn that the relationship between them was very close - and that Henry was not fooled by Max's frequent attempts to hoodwink him.  We get the impression that the Uncle is trying to teach his nephew some important life lessons, and that the estate and winery have great significance and value beyond merely being an asset that can be sold.  We also see that Max really loved his Uncle, and has fond memories of the good times he had there as a child - Henry was his only family.<br /><br />As the story evolves, Max begins to regret how he allowed his hedonistic lifestyle and pursuit of wealth to isolate him from his Uncle, whom he had not seen in years.  The trip back to France awakens memories as he meets those who knew and loved his Uncle, and are working (sometimes behind Max's back) to preserve Henry's legacy.<br /><br />Of course there is a love interest, in the form of Marion Cotillard as \\"Fanny\\" - in her first English language film; as well as a possible daughter of Henry's that shows up unexpectedly, played by the Australian actress Abbie Cornish.  Both are excellent actresses, and I'm sure we'll see excellent performances from them in future films.<br /><br />I also hope that the lack of box office success for this film does not discourage Crowe from trying again.  It's a good film, and I'm convinced he'll eventually do at least as well, if not better, then Harrison Ford has done in very similar films, such as another favorite of mine - [[ASIN:B00005S6K8 Sabrina]].<br /><br />\\"A Good Year\\" is not award winning material, nor does it pretend to be anything other than a sweet little romantic comedy.  As such, it works more as a comedy than as a romance - there is lots of physical and sight humor in the film, all in the beautiful setting of the Chateau and its surroundings.<br /><br />All in all, I found this film to be a more or less average effort in terms of the plot and writing, but above average for the entertainment value, beautiful photography, and solid performances.  So, in terms of overall value, I'll put it down for four stars: a good choice to rent or buy and see with your significant other some quiet and romantic evening - and be sure to not forget to bring along a good bottle of french wine!as he meets those who knew and loved his Uncle, and are working (sometimes behind Max's back) to preserve Henry's legacy.<br /><br />Of course there is a love interest, in the form of Marion Cotillard as \\"Fanny\\" - in her first English language film; as well as a possible daughter of Henry's that shows up unexpectedly, played by the Australian actress Abbie Cornish.

0805079831|5.0|Naomi Klein's book, \\"The Shock Doctrine,\\" is a brilliant, stunning, and exceptional work of the mind. It will transform your consciousness from its roots upward.

B000Y179KO|5.0|I am going to review the music on this CD and not like some others on here who seem to have a problem with the CD being sold at a 'big box' retailer or that original band members from the early 70's are not in the band(and haven't been for 30+ years).  This is the lineup I became familiar with when I heard 'New Kid in Town' on the radio in 1976 when I was kid(minus Don Felder - I know I know! calm down you guys).  That was the first song I ever heard from Eagles.  I remember it quite clearly.<br /><br />This CD is great.  I can't really think of any real clunkers on here, although 'Guilty of the Crime', the Joe Walsh song, seems to be a little on the bland side.  There might be a few songs not as interesting as others, which is true of any CD by any band, but it's still great.  I was dissapointed that 'One Day At A Time\\" was not on here because it was a great song(performed live by Joe Walsh on the Farewell 1 - Live in Melbourne DVD).  Don Henley and Glen Frey still write great songs and sing harmony very well after all these years..  Being a fan of Don Henley's solo work, I particularily liked his songs which could've easily fit on his solo albums I suppose.  \\"Waiting in the Weeds\\" is the one true standout of the CD out of the 20 songs.  I have replayed that 7+ minute song over and  over.  The curiously titled \\"I Dreamed There Was No War\\" is a short instrumental..  The title was an interesting choice(regardless of your views on ANY war).<br /><br />Basically what anyone needs to ask themselves before buying this is WHY are they or are they NOT buying 'Long Road Out Of Eden'.  If it's because the CD is only available at a 'big box' retailer, than it's your loss.  Don't go in the place then and go buy your Cheetos, Pepsis and Doritos at some other 'big box' retailer - you are in the minority and you are missing out on one of the best CDs to come out this year.  Same goes for those who harp on Don Felder being gone or the original members from the first few albums(I don't even remember their names to be honest, no disrespect intended).  If you like great music and their past songs, it's a no brainer.  I doubt this band would put something out half baked when it's been 28 years since 'The Long Run' and 13 years since they got back together for the 'Hell Freezes Over' tour/cd/dvd.<br /><br />If your Eagles fan, you have to get this.  It's one of the best CDs of the year to come out.ember their names to be honest, no disrespect intended).  If you like great music and their past songs, it's a no brainer.

B0000JCFPE|4.0|What a piece of trash... a very interesting piece of trash. This is one of the most riveting movies I have ever seen. Michael Douglas & Sharon Stone are well cast in the leads. But I have a burning question: Is there one murderer or two murderers or is it three murderers? As many times as I have watched this movie I haven't been able to figure it out. And which one is the copycat: Sharon Stone or Jeanne Triplehorn? Who's the real blonde & does it matter? The movie is twisted & has a lot of twists. I never tire of watching this movie, I always seem to be looking for something I might've missed in a previous viewing but it's not there. Even without the gratuitous beaver shot I thoroughly enjoy this piece of trash. I love it & I'm still watching it. I need to chip some ice, anybody got an icepick?

B000002UAU|5.0|ESSENTIAL ALBUM!!! Just gotta add my name to the list! This is the album that changed rock' n' roll a second time, both by the Beatles. It's incredible what this band did, including the producer George Martin, using a four-track recorder. This album was a representation of what this band could do in a studio. \\"Revolver\\" was the transitional album of a touring band into a studio-only band. \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" is where the fruition of that effort materialized. My favorites are: \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\", \\"Getting Better\\", \\"A Day in the Life\\" & \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\". Song-wise, this is not their strongest album (there's more than one weak moment) but there is something magical here. This is the album that Paul really began to flex his muscles within the band; creatively, he was strong, but he also really began to exercise himself as the arranger & musical director of the group. This fact, & the death of Brian Epstein, are two of the reasons why the breakup bells began to sound. Long Live Beatlemania!
0143038419|5.0|I say \\"surprisingly\\" because I am not religious, nor spiritual, so I was afraid that I would not be able to relate to the author's journey or to her message. However, there were parts of the book that made me recommend it highly to friends who are attempting to cope with difficult times in their lives. In \\"Eat\\" the author meets up with Depression and Loneliness, personifying them in a way that I found enchanting and eliminating their power. Similarly, in her tale at the end of how she had visited a tiny island for ten days at the depth of her despair to meditate in silence, she again confronts emotions and thoughts we may fear: sorrow, anger and shame. Those two descriptions were enough for me to prize this book. As for the rest of it, I found the review of her year overseas to be entertaining and interesting, despite my personal lack of interest in things gourmet, yoga and medicine men. Overall, I found the book definitely worth reading.
1594481784|5.0|I've always been fascinated by the challenge of a male author writing from inside the head of a woman. I've wanted to read a work that faithfully holds true to the femeinine thinking mystique.  Nick Hornby has done something new. Instead of dramatizing the gender conflicts, he has used them merely as a backdrop to tell a riveting and very human story of one flawed woman's confrontation with herself and human nature.    This reminds me of another great book, [[ASIN:0978602404 HILLARY]], in that it develops the full complexity and subtlety of conflicted human nature... and does it without the too cute British Island boy plunk.  Out of this character study, he develops complex themes about human nature, loyalty, betrayal, and relationships.     I haven't read a more literary creation in quite some time.  Try [[ASIN:0978602420 Upland Road]], [[ASIN:0978602498 GODLESS]] and [[ASIN:0978602412 Wanderlost]], [[ASIN:097860248X The Progress Of Man]] for further reading.

0800130928|5.0|Taxi Driver gives us a gripping character study of Travis Bickle, a rather lonely man who takes a job as a nighttime taxi driver because he can't sleep at night. Unfortunately for Travis, he can't sleep in the day either; instead he goes to dirty movies and runs around the city. Travis is unable to make any real emotional connections with people, although he does try.<br /><br />Travis's first interest in a young woman named Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) who is working to help a Senator get elected to the White House. Betsy soon rejects Travis, though, when on their first date he takes her to a dirty movie. After being rejected by Betsy, Travis soon develops an interest in guns--but in a most unhealthy way. Travis dreams of murder although he does still have enough of his sanity left to want to rescue a very young girl, Iris (Jodie Foster), from a group that uses her as a woman of the night. All of this happens as Travis descends deeper and deeper into a world of madness and psychosis.<br /><br />The insight we gain into Travis's character could not have been done any better: we see Travis as the outsider who watches New York City and its people go by as people take rides in his taxi cab. He meets a good intentioned politician and many not so admirable characters as well. All along, we increasingly see that Travis is ever more on the outside looking in; and he's often remarkably disgusted and enraged about the not so happy quality of life issues in the city.<br /><br />Will Travis rescue Iris from a life of being a woman of the night? Will Travis be able to control his urges to use his guns on real people instead of keeping his outrage in the realm of fantasy? What might happen if Betsy and Travis were to get together again--is it possible? No spoilers here, folks, you'll just have to watch the movie to find out!<br /><br />The cinematography shows strong in the pans of the city at all hours as it is seen through Travis's eyes; and the choreography works well in the bloody fighting at the end of the movie, too.<br /><br />A warning to parents: there is quite a bit of violence and mental illness in this film. This is not a Disney movie!<br /><br />Overall, Taxi Driver takes hold of your attention from the very first scene and never lets it go. I marveled at the fine acting and the plot moves along at a good pace. I highly recommend this film for people who enjoy great character studies and the work of such greats as Robert DeNiro and Martin Scorsese.ovie, too.

B000V78BOY|5.0|I have seen many versions of Mozart's Die Zauberflote in the last 40 years and this particular production is the best yet! Papageno, The Queen of The Night, Tamino and Tamina were wonderful. The stage and musical directors followed in detail the libretto. The performance lasts over 2 hours and 40 minutes of perfectly written areas and recitatives. This is a treasure for Opera lovers and Mozart's fans. The HD and the DTS 5.1 are pefect for this performance.<br /><br />Note: when setting up the sound, make sure you click on the second choice to get the full range of sound. If you click on the top choice (decompressed True HD sound), you lose db's and the sound is muffled).<br /><br />This is a must for my repertoire!!

I personally haven't had chance to use 90% of what I've learned in school.  But this book has opened my eyes to the root of what we do as engineers.  Not something that'll get you a better grade in school.

B000VI70WM|4.0|Like all the Duran Duran releases, Red Carpet Massacre is  unique, experimental, & fun. A voyage to place you've never been before w/ the band at the helm. If you are wanting another 7 & the ragged tiger, expectedly you will be dissappointed (so pop your cassette tape in and go back to that comfortable place in 1984). RCM is new, modern and very sexy, and even better live. I got to see them at the Barrymore in NYC, and really enjoyed hearing the whole CD from start to end in 1 big block, then the electro set, then the hits...what a great show. RCM is not in of itself Duran Duran. Buy it, listen, enjoy and DO catch them live for fuller sense of who Duran Duran are.  Everyone is satisfied after a good duran duran gig. It's very refreshing to see them band so excited about the new RCM material, lets hope for their creative fires to remain stoked!
0385340540|4.0|Somehow I keep getting pulled back into Grisham.  I struggle to find alternatives for my reading enjoyment, but his books just pop up everywhere I turn.  I had sworn off Grisham after the preachy The Street Lawyer but was sucked into reading this book.  I was in fact pleasantly surprised.  It's the story of a lobbyist who, like most lobbyists, forgets about right and wrong in pursuit of his client's and his own interest.  That leads to prison and life on the run.<br /><br />Grisham likes protagonists to be morally compromised.  Sometimes this makes for interesting storytelling as in A Time to Kill and sometimes it doesn't, as in The Chamber.  The Broker falls more towards the A Time to Kill end of the spectrum, although as the Broker Joel Backman suffers in prison then is later chased by bad guys I occasionally hoped that they would catch up with him.

Yanni's music is so relaxing, energetic and melodious it takes my out of this world.
B000059T00|5.0|Looking back at the summer of 1969, you'd have to say that there was indeed a bumper crop of classic rock albums. Let's see there was Workingman's Dead, which transitioned the Dead from psycadellic jug band to a new acoustic blues-folk-country genera that continued on into American Beauty. We got the amazing Soft Parade by The Doors in '69. Jethro Tull put out their debut album, the only recording with orginal Blodyn Pig guitarist Mick Abrams. Procol Harum signed on with A Salty Dog, a collection of dark broodong songs evoking \\"Tales Of The Ancient Mariner\\". There was the understated brilliance of Crosby Stills & Nash. Together or without Neil Young, this was the first edition of what would become one of Rock's most enduring super groups.<br /><br />That brings us to rock's most ill-fated super group....Bind Faith. For my money this was the premire event in an all too brief period of unsurpassed classic rock releases. They became for me, a perfect blend of almost all the aforementioned classics. Winwood carried along the haunting bluesy vocals he perfected with Traffic and Clapton showed the world that he didn't need to extend guitar solos beyond the three minute mark to express heart-felt passion deep down to your toes.<br /><br />So why did Blind Faith collapse in less than twelve months? Clapton lends a lot of credence to the idea that \\"Music From Big Pink\\" by The Band opened his mind to a whole new \\"roots\\" sound. He wanted to get back to tight ensamble playing. It seems he wanted to capture a more understated and less in your face approach. And of course you can't argue with the man who brought us \\"Layla\\" and so many other great songs. Steve Winwood reformed Traffic, without Dave Mason and Ginger Baker went on to join the Airfore, Ginger Baker's Airforce of course.<br /><br />It's cleched I know but Blind Faith really cements where I was and what I was at nineteen years old in that oh so wonderful, magical, whacky world of the summer of '69. I'll forever regretnot joining my friends who hitch hiked from New York to Providence, RI to see Blind Faith in concert. If I had only known that it was to be a once in a lifetime Experience.

0375842209|5.0|Sometimes a fictional interpretation of history is exactly what we need in order to be able to come to a real understanding of what it meant to live through historic events, particularly horrific ones. Markus Zusak provides us with a masterful interpretation of the Nazi period of German history from the perspective of ordinary people suffering through it and striving to keep their lives together and their souls alive and kicking within the horrific and ever-tightening boundaries constructed by the Nazi regime. He gives us a gut-wrenchingly palpable empathy for people facing harrowing decisions on a daily basis. His marvelous characters bring to life the dilemmas of those who believe they should help the Jews as well as the equally nightmarish predicament of Jews who through receiving help put others in danger. We see all of this through the perspective of the main character Liesel, who is only a young girl. Her innocence and the gradual realizations she comes to about the events swirling around her in a maelstrom of horror evoke a remarkable empathy in the reader. If you want to understand how the little people cope with such tragic historic events without allowing their souls to be crushed, read this book. Ultimately it is a portrait of the resilience and hope of the human spirit.
B000001H00|5.0|Chance happenstance found me sitting behind Harry Blech - a highly accomplished fiddle player in his own right and who had worked as conductor with Milstein in the Goldmark concerto - at a London concert a lot of years ago. Part of an overheard conversation included Blech saying \\"Of all the recitalists I have heard,\\" (and he must have heard a few!) \\"Milstein almost certainly is my favourite.\\" I am not able to make a judgment from his expert perspective but I am at one with the conclusion - he's my favourite too.<br /><br />I have these works performed by Suk, Perlman, Ricci and Shumsky and to varying degrees, like them all. Of course, I have heard renderings from others as well but after years of living with this DG set, originally recorded in  Brent Town Hall, 1973, Milstein's offering has to be chosen as my desert island companion.<br /><br />That these works are difficult to play is a given but the performance is intended to be musical, not a demonstration of technical wizardry, yet so many players seem to make a point of exaggeratedly sawing their way through the broken chords. The harmony, beyond double-stopping, largely is implicit and the listener should be quite capable of inferring that which Bach so cleverly implies. After all, there are limits to the polyphony to be extracted from an essentially monophonic instrument! Perhaps it's the absence of such bowing gymnastics coupled with Milstein's intimate knowledge of these pieces acquired over so many years, his profound musicianship and sure-footed intonation which help set this performance above others.<br /><br />As for vibrato mentioned in another review; it is a device not necessarily excluded from \\"authentic period\\" performance (however that might be defined) but certainly has to be employed sparingly and judiciously - Glenn Gould used a surprising amount of pedal but it doesn't show. Milstein does introduce vibrato at appropriate moments but it is so artfully done that it is barely noticeable and certainly never intrusive. Mercifully, the dreadful tremolo-palsy exhibited by so many string players as soon as they get anywhere near a fingerboard is absent at this level of playing.<br /><br />The digital transfer of what was an excellent recording to begin with has been well done. Frankly, I can find nothing to criticise and everything to praise in this superb collection.Mercifully, the dreadful tremolo-palsy exhibited by so many string players as soon as they get anywhere near a fingerboard is absent at this level of playing.

A great read.
B000NA2BEU|3.0|Seasons 1 and 2 of Veronica Mars were brilliant. Unlike 99% of the rest of TV, V.M. had incredibly intelligent writing, both in terms of witty dialogue and smart, intricate, and exciting plot development, always wrapping up with a totally satisfying resolution. The acting was generally spot-on, too. Season 3 was another story. While still significantly better than most other shows, Season 3 suffered from much weaker writing and some downright embarrassing acting from secondary characters. The plots were predicable with fewer fun twists and turns, the college stereotype-characters (pierced, angry feminists vs. misogynistic frat-boys) were phony and cheap, and the pointless Logan-Veronica love storyline stooped to soap opera lows. The show seemed \\"phoned-in\\" throughout the entire season - the essential Veronica Mars spirit was gone. I've heard that this had much to do with the changes imposed on the show by the CW channel, and a concurrent mass exodus of many of the Season 1 and 2 writing staff. With new writers, the characters don't seem like themselves and say things you'd never expect them to. Keith Mars is devastated with the mere thought that his daughter might go to prison in Season 2 - in Season 3, he gets a kick out of visiting her in jail! For whatever reasons, the Season 3 Veronica is a mere shadow of her former self. For newbie Veronica fans - go ahead and watch Season 3, it has its moments, and Kristen Bell is still adorable and sassy, but prepare yourself for disappointment. It just isn't the same.

B000PKG7I4|5.0|Frank, Amy's actual debut album is just as fantastic as those who know her Back to Black album would expect.  From listening to the entire American debut album, it is obvious that she is a talented lyricist and singer, and that she has an exceptionally fine-tuned ear for overall music quality.  This new-to-America album possesses the same musical and lyrical maturity, delving (sometimes deeply) into the emotions of anger and pain caused by others (usually men).  \\"F**k Me Pumps\\" could very well have been the inspiration for Pink's \\"Stupid Girls\\" single, as it humorously and scathingly takes on the dime-a-dozen \\"hollywood glamor\\" girls that us sane people have come to despise.  Perhaps the most stunning track on the album, however, is the sorrow-drenched \\"What Is It About Men\\", where Amy's vocal and lyrical talents shine the brightest (major hats off to the production on this number, as well).    The tabloids love to try to bring Amy down by broadcasting her substance abuse problems and rowdy behavior, but the thing is that she doesn't try to cover it up.  She's a full-fledged bad girl, and she readily admits it.  Perhaps it's this dysfunctional lifestyle that has enabled her to pen such brilliant lyrics and sing with such musical conviction.  Regardless, I'm thankful that she's made her way over here from England to help distill the pollution that is the American music scene right now.  Nowadays, you can pretty much live by this rule when judging music acts:  anyone who uses live horns has gotta be okay.
0743454537|1.0|This was the worst book I have read in a long time.  Between the changing of narrative voice to make up for its weak character development, the incredibly over-dramatized plot, the unbelievable plot twists, and above all, the idiotic (I'm sorry, there's no other word for it) ending, this book's greatest contribution to my life experience was to make me appreciate the beauty, complexity, and value of real literature.
B00004WEJZ|4.0|Bond fans often turn up their noses with the mention of this film. They've called it \\"Connery at his worst\\" or complained that it's not a \\"genuine\\" entry in the series. Yet, I went to see it when it was first released & liked it. A remake of the classic \\"Thunderball\\", it's flawed & imperfect, but still an enjoyable film. It was great to see Sean Connery again in his \\"007\\" status, playing an older Bond, but one which hasn't lost his knack for adventure & romance.   While some of the trademarks are missing---understandably, since it was made outside the home studios of MGM/UA---it's the film itself that counts, and Connery makes the most of it, showing all the other Bond actors how it's done. He slips back into the role so easily that it's as if he never left.  It also benefits from a first-rate villain in actor Klaus Maria Brandauer as Largo, a baddie who's more complex than the sum of his parts. Kim Basinger--here at the beginning of her film career--plays the typical Bond babe who finds herself in a power struggle between Bond & Largo.   This is a much-maligned film that deserves a second look.

I run, similar to Chris's passion for running in the woods, solo, with nature and now with Eddie and his great passionate music that resonates throughout my body and spirit.     I think that many people are moved by the book, movie and now the music because each of us have had those feelings of wanting to escape the everyday humdrum of society and what is expected as normal living.

B000WMEAKC|5.0|Okay, so, when Apoligize first came out I fell in absolute love with the song and Ryan Tedder's voice. After listening to the original version (which OnRepublic wrote, NOT Timbaland) I thought it was even better than the radio release, so naturally, I waited in anticipation for the release.  Since it came out, it's been on repeat on my ipod, in my cd player, where ever.  Here's what I've got to say about the album: the ENTIRE album is beautiful and you don't have to skip those not-so-good tracks like you'd generally have to do with any other cd.  It's well rounded musically, too. It's not everyday where you have a hit band play the cello on a hit song, ya know? You get to hear everything: acoustic, electric guitar, cello, beautiful piano, and awesome drums and bass. So, what I'm saying is, is that along with Tedder's great voice and songwritting, the album is a complete hit from the first to the last track.  If you like U2, the Fray, Jars of Clay, Matt Kearney, or Matchbox 20 then you'll like this... so go out and buy it (just say it's an early Christmas present to yourself :P)

B000QYB72A|5.0|[[ASIN:0385512058 Never Eat Alone: And Other Secrets to Success, One Relationship at a Time]]  This book is already a bestseller and it is worth reading. Keith Ferrazzi is a master in building relationships, not only networks, and he is able to describe how he achieved his expertise. \\"Never Eat Alone\\" is great when it comes to show the skills and strategies we need to succeed as well.    Let us browse through the book with its four sections. The first deals with \\"The Mind Set\\" and some of the key sentences are about the necessity to be connected with the right kind of people: \\"Poverty, I realized, wasn't only a lack of financial resources; it was isolation from the kind of people that could help you make more of yourself\\". Ferrazzi is fully aware of his origin and it is very convincing how he draws conclusions from lessons of his childhood in a working-class setting. The author made his way to finally become the founder and CEO of his own established marketing and sales consulting company.  So, how do we get connected? Ferrazzi points out that in fact we do need mentors to support us. But it is no one way street, on the contrary: \\"That's what I mean by connecting. It's a constant process of giving and receiving - of asking for and offering help.\\" A \\"mission critical\\" part of the puzzle to build relationships is to find and specify your very own goals - what is your mission here on earth? Ferrazzi is hands-on with three steps:  First: Find your passion  Second: Putting Goals to Paper  Third: Create a Personal \\"Board of Advisors\\"  (When you check out Ferrazzis website you will come across a more detailed process, called \\"LifeCoach Tool 1.0\\": [...]  The author reminds us to build the network before we need it. And he encourages us to focus on our immediate network, like friends and family, to start with. But, most of all, he praises audacity by telling the story of his father asking for a tricycle for children from someone else's trash - he just had the guts to ask, overcoming the fear of being rejected.    Section Two describes the \\"Skill Set\\". And this part of the book is really practical: it deals with research for data and background information, with Ferrazi's \\"four rules for what I call warm calling\\", with working together with \\"Gatekeepers\\". Of course, he explains why we should NOT eat alone. A special focus is set upon attending conferences, and there is more about \\"the art of small talk\\" and \\"connecting with connectors\\". This section is an easy read but do not underestimate it; instead, use it to double check your own habits and skills.    Section Tree -\\"Turning Connections into Compatriots\\"- dives deeper. To go beyond loose connections he suggests to take a closer look at topics such as \\"health, wealth, and children\\" because they have the most impact. Another way to leverage your network is simply using your relationships to help others: \\"The best sort of connecting occurs when you can bring together two people from entirely different worlds. The strength of your network derives as much from the diversity of your relationships as it does from their quality or quantity\\". In other words - don't ask what is in for you first; instead help to make the connection, supply the solution. This might sound naïve but other authors come to similar conclusions (e.g. Tim Sanders, Love Is The Killer App).  Part of this section is also very hands-on about 24/7, 365 days a year relationship management. What I personally liked best was the suggestion to divide the network into groups and find a way to deal with each of these specifically. Ferrazzi has five categories: \\"Personal\\", Customers\\", \\"Prospects\\", Important Business Associates\\", and \\"Aspirational Contacts\\".  Another how-to part is about setting up meetings, such as dinner parties, get-togethers.    Section Four: \\"Trading Up and Giving Back\\" is the final part of the book. In this last section Ferrazzi closes the circle: have the right mind-set and focus on your mission (section one); develop your set of skills and strategies for networking (section two); be part of a strong, resilient, and generous network (section three); and now, build and \\"broadcast\\" your brand (like Tom Peters' phrase \\"Brand You\\"). This is a key for being successful as a builder of relationships. One of the role models he studies in detail is the Dalai Lama: \\"Follow the example of this simple Buddhist monk who channels his charm and warmth into compelling stories that energize a diverse swath of people into action. In this new era of brands, in an economy that values emotions over numbers, storytellers will have the edge\\".  The book has proven that Keith Ferrazzi is a master in building relationships. And he is - in his very own way - crazy about it. At the end of the book he gives a clear statement that (work/life) \\"balance is a myth\\", meaning that his concept of life knows no differentiation between \\"private\\" and \\"work\\". It is a unique approach of Ferrazzi and he succeeds in broadcasting his very own brand.    So, what can we do with the book (and with Ferrazzi's website [...] [...] Let us first check our mind-set for building relationships: is it open, generous? Then we can figure out which of the hints, tips, and strategies we can apply to our own networking activities. And, finally, we should be helpful and willing to act like mentors and coaches for others.

0618526412|2.0|I have had the misfortune of picking 3 highly recommended 'classic' books in the past month that all melted together and subdued my voracious reading bug.      The first was Chocolat, followed by The Heart is a Lonely Hunter and capped off with Snow Falling on Cedars. It took me approximately 2 1/2 times longer to get through these books than other books and after completing all three, I can only slightly differentiate Chocolat away from the rest of them.      In terms of The Heart is a Lonely Hunter - I can see why this is an Oprah Book Club book.  Her Book Club started out good - nothing too complicated, nothing to fluffy - but then, in my opinion, her choices became too factual and less about enjoyment.  I cannot get through a Toni Morrison book to save my life and even if I could, I wouldn't understand it.  I feel similarly about this book - I can get through it and I understand it, but I'm hanging by a very thin thread.      Some Oprah Book books really struck me - Icy Sparks, anything by Wally Lamb, for example - but if they don't totally strike me, they seem to go the opposite.     I've read a few book since reading this one and can't honestly remember what it's about.  I piqued my memory before writing this down though and I remember some disgust with the deaf mute in the hospital and that was the extent of my emotional connection to this book.    I don't think it's a must read and I don't think it's once of those books that, once you labor through, you want to reread.  I would skip this one.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I watched the movie tonight, and feel really humbled by it. This feeling is also accompanied by a bit of anger, disappointment, a bit of feeling duped, let down, and kind of an expected sadness, if you will. I have been fortunate to have health care, and have been fortunate to not have any serious ailments or illnesses. I hope to not have to ever experience anything like any of the stories on this film.<br /><br />I have heard a few bad stories, one being a friend's roommate/landlord. She apparently has had a bit of terrible luck with a huge, and unexpected, hospital bill. I don't know if she had \\"good health care\\", or if she just had \\"bad luck\\". Either way she has had difficulty paying rent due to paying some pretty intense hospital bills.<br /><br />The one thing I will have to disagree with you on is your place of relocation - I would much rather prefer the UK, than Canada. I am not leaving anytime soon, nor turning my back on this country, but have always enjoyed the country and it's people, and the health care benefit is another great quality of the country. Also, I have witnessed the beauty of their health care first hand. Me, my friend, and another friend were in our hotel room, in London, and our friend seemed to break her foot. We called down to the front desk, and they called an ambulance, which was there in like 10 minutes. They were helpful, and took her to the hospital, where we met up with her. She had x-rays taken and an initial cast applied to her foot and lower leg, and she went back a few days later to get a new cast put on. We were shocked/surprised to hear that there was no cost to her at all. A foreigner who, by her own stupidness, received timely medical treatment - for free.<br /><br />So, I am definitely glad that I got to see this film, and will make sure to pass it along to a few friends who I know would enjoy it.
B000W1V5VU|5.0|Ocean's 13 is as good as Ocean's 11.  It has so many twists and turns and surprises that it will keep you guessing and laughing through the whole movie!  A must see if you liked Ocean's 11.  The cast is great...minus having a hot girl involved.  (Missed having a Julia Roberts type character from Ocean's 11.)<br />Definite 5 stars!  I will be watching it again and again.
B000002J09|5.0|This album is how musicians become legends and music transcends time and classification.  I was a 13 year old listening to pop music when I came across my parents vinyl version of Zeppelin IV.  I had recalled, from somewhere, hearing something about \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" being the greatest song ever made.  Now I was born in 1975, so it was 1988, and I had a turntable (thank God) ... From the time I put that needle down my life, at least musically, was changed forever.  \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" is a blues assault like none other, possibly my favorite song of all time. \\"The Battle of Evermore\\" is at once, both etheral, and mournful.  \\"Four Sticks\\" and \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\" just flat out rock. \\"Blackdog\\", \\"Rock N' Roll\\" and \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" are iconic rock masterpieces that defined the genre. And finally \\"Going to California\\" proved that a slow song can be introspective and not be whiny.  I will never forget hearing the climax of \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", coming from that vinyl record, louder from the needle than through the speakers ... What else can you say?
B000G759LW|5.0|Most of the songs are awesome!  There are a few that are a little too old style big band for my taste but the CD set on a whole makes for great listening.  Nobody can match her voice!  If you like Christina's work in general then you should like this CD set.
1582701709|5.0|Hey, Anastasia,  I'm sorry, but we do create our own experiences in life. Good, bad, whatever. As long as we give the responsibility for events in our lives to someone or some thing outside ourselves, we'll always be at the mercy of forces that we can't control. Take responsibility for it all. It won't hurt!
B000VLE3GA|1.0|Talk about a cash-grab just in time for the holiday season. Not ONE new track???? Not even something live, unreleased, or a b-side?  The songs on this CD are all lifted from prior Zeppelin releases, so this is simply a waste of time and money.  I equate the greed involved w/this release to the level of Gene Simmons - never thought Page and Plant would stoop to that level, but I guess I was wrong.    I own every Zep album and can gladly burn this compliation for you exactly how it is sequenced by Rhino....So spend your money elsewhere this holiday season...
0446577391|5.0|WARNING: DO NOT read \\"Stone Cold\\" until you have read \\"The Collectors\\"- it will make much more sense and be that much more enjoyable and entertaining!     While I thought \\"The Collectors\\" was one of the best action/adventure/intrigue novels I had read in a really long time, I must say that \\"Stone Cold\\" was even better!  This fast-paced, exciting and ingenious novel certainly proves how talented David Baldacci is. With this book, he's at the top of his game; he expertly delivered twists and turns and multi-layered sub-plots galore that leave you hungry for more.     Without giving too much away, this book picks up where \\"The Collectors\\" ended- Bagger's still hunting for Annabelle Conroy, and Oliver Stone becomes prey himself. Will the Camel Club come through? You'll have to read it and see....there's no way you could possibly predict this one!      I can't recommend this book highly enough for all readers, and especially lovers of this genre, since David Baldacci is one of its finest talents. I truly hope these Camel Club adventures get made into movies, and I hope to read more!!!
B000FC0SIM|5.0|I enjoyed reading this straight through within a couple days (total probably a handful of hours).  It starts with his earlier life and how he got started with writing.  All VERY interesting and well written to keep you wanting more.  I look forward to working with the inspiration and direction received from King's words in my own works which I'm ready to get back too!  I would recommend reading this to anyone interested in writing and those simply interested in Stephen King's journey as a writer.  Enjoy and it's a keeper!
0743496728|4.0|Jodi Picoult always writes believable stories.  This latest offering was no disappointment.  She researches her characters thoroughly and brings them to life on the page.  It is easy to get lost in the story and connected to the developments and characters.  The twist at the end was not unexpected but perhaps a little less speed would have been better.  It felt as if Ms Picoult only had a certain number of pages left in her and she had to get all of the words out of her in a hurry - this is the only reason for not giving the book 5 stars.  I loved it and recommend it to all Jodi Picoult fans.
B000WQW988|5.0|This DVD is great! The sound is amazing (DTS) and the picture quality is just as good. And yes, there are subtitles. I don't know what that other guy was talking about.
B00005NWLO|5.0|Jesus H Christ! What an album, \\"I mean CD\\". This CD blew my socks off! Un Friggen believable. I could not stop playing it. I bought the original back in 1977 before the plane went down.This was the album that really turned me on to Skynyrd. The sound is so much more improved on this new CD. Best live Album I have EVER heard! Nothing else comes close. Not the Eagles. Not Frampton, Nobody. PERIOD!
B000VWYNNW|4.0|I've read most of the \\"reviews\\" on Amazon regarding this CD.  Be grateful that this CD has FINALLY been remastered and cleaned up. Plant had surgery on his vocal cords for nodes a few months before this tour began. He was trying to pace himself and work through it. That explains why some songs are sung an octave lower. A year or two after this recording he fully recovered his astounding vocal range.  The versions of Black Dog and Rock & Roll are not the best I've heard, but overall, this CD is WELL work your money. How The West Was Won was their ultimate best live CD.  To all you b***** would-be critics and rock \\"experts\\", considering how much money fans have shelled out on bootleg CD's with DEPLORABLE sound quality over the decades - this CD is a bargain.  Who cares if Page cleaned up some of the flaws!?!?!  This fan is happy he did!!
B000YAF4OS|3.0|The Mist is a much better King adaption for Thomas Jane than Dreamcatcher was. It's an entertaining if not a bit overly preachy and dramatic creature feature. I mean they are stuck in a store with creatures outside in the Mist and they also have to deal with a crazy woman who starts preaching to them about religion. It's okay to get people to believe in faith during situations like that but this woman goes overboard.<br /><br />  I don't blame Thomas Jane and other characters for wanting to leave, she's controlling and clearly insane. What bugs me with the movie is how it ends. Are we supposed to believe that everyone should've stayed with this crazy woman who was willing to have her followers kill non-believers. So I was entertained by the movie and her character but I also don't think it should've been so much about faith. The creature part is so well done that as a slimy and gross film it's almost as good as the Thing.<br /><br />  The end just brings the movie down since I saw Thomas Jane's character as a good man and the end just makes him look like an idiot for not believing in the crazy woman. To me I wouldn't want to be around this woman either yet follow her beliefs. It's not that I don't believe in god but the woman just isn't crazy but she's mean to everyone and stand offish and acts more evil than holy. Hell I expected her to be the lead creature. Despite me not liking how it ended I still think it's under-rated movie that was well done by the director. He did 2 King prison movies before this and I think he did a great job handling a different tone. I wouldn't say it's superior to the Shawshank Redemption or the Green Mile though.
055358202X|3.0|It's like all the characters you don't actually like - together! Sure, we get to see bad things happen to the Stark girls (but not quite bad enough to be notable), and the fruits of Cersei's labors, but by dividing up the 4th book into two halves, i think Martin made the mistake of leaving out the more charismatic people. Where's Tyrion and John Snow, basically? Even Stannis or Danerys? I can't imagine anyone was waiting with baited breath for the continuing story of whatever the name of the ugly knight chick was, but here we get it.... over and over (and leading to an event that should please nobody). By the time I was through, Jaime had somehow become the most compelling still-alive character, which, while an accomplishment, is hardly a triumph.
B000WMFZNS|5.0|It seems this title will be the premier release for the new \\"Miriam Collection\\" initiated by Genius Products and the Weinstein Co.

B000AL5OZA|3.0|Agnetha Faltskog, left to her own devices as a post ABBA soloist, chose weak material consistently on her three 1980s releases.  Each collection, however, had one or two songs that stood out.  \\"Can't Shake Loose\\" from her first release was a legitimately sensual moody rocker.  And \\"We Got A Way\\" from her third release also was tight and catchy.  Most of her other songs, including those on this CD, were too canned, too sentimental, and too boring to do her vocals justice.      On this collection, one song stands out as literate, sexy, and edgy.  This is \\"Click Track,\\" a unique recording that is very un-Agnetha-like.  The arrangement remains subtle yet urgent, effectively using 80s dance sounds without overkill.  The lyric is suggestive and sexy and rife with double entendre.      Yes, if Agnetha Faltskog could have managed a whole CD with songs like Click Track, We Got A Way, and Can't Shake Loose, she would have been a much bigger solo star. (I might also include Take Good Care of Your Children and It's So Nice To Be Rich as worthy contenders.)
B0000E64TR|5.0|Listen to the bonus track - 13.   \\"Candle In The Wind (Acoustic Mix)\\"  Awesome recording and on SACD!  Soundstage is HUGE.  Use this track to explain imaging.  A must have.
140120306X|4.0|One can certainly say this is different from other graphic novels, and your reaction to is  very much a matter of taste.     That said, keep in mind that this is not the third adventure or volume of the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.  it is the Black Dossier, and the limited story in the book is simply there as a device to explain how it was found and kind of what it is, and why Mina and Alan are still around and young.      The third volume of the League will be entitled \\"Century\\", and will not be published until next year at the earliest.  As presently conceived the story will be in three self-contained 72 page books, the first taking place in 1910, the second in 1968 and the third taking place now (well, in Their 2008).   Reportedly it is much darker (e.g. Nemo dies in 1910 in the first volume)

B0001HLVS2|3.0|Not since [[ASIN:B00009ZYBY Gladiator (Widescreen Edition)]] has the substantial acting skill of Russell Crowe been fully harnessed in a film.  Peter Weir, director of 'Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, disrupts this trend with his skillful use of Crowe as the captain of a British warship in 1805, during the first war with Napoleon.  A French privateer ship called the Acheron is to be stopped by the British warship HMS Surprise, under the command of Captain Jack \\"Lucky Jack\\" Aubrey.  The two ships chase each other all over the Southern Atlantic Ocean and in doing so, provide an excellent look at what life was like aboard a 19th century warship.  The harsh realities of the day-to-day grind, the fierce seas, the constant danger of attack, and the political struggles involving the ship's leadership - all make important contributions to this adventure story, which keeps the audience on the edges of their seats during its entire 138 minute runtime.<br /><br />Like [[ASIN:B000065U1N Black Hawk Down]], Master and Commander is more focused on the events and the crew, rather than on any single character.  The director's efforts to reproduce the realistic environment in which a sailor of the British fleet would find himself during the early 1800s are evident from the sheer volume of detail that is included in this picture.  Production designer William Sandell, and set decorator Robert Gould successfully manage to recreate the 19th century British style of decoration down to the smallest possible details.  The attempt to portray the events realistically does not end there as Weir has the actors covered in grime, grease, sweat, and filth, in contrast to the traditional Hollywood attempts at glossing over the grittier elements of film settings.  'Master and Commander' is more in keeping with the amazing work done by Wolfgang Petersen in [[ASIN:0767802470 Das Boot - The Director's Cut]] than with the mediocre efforts in [[ASIN:B00003CXHJ U-571 (Collector's Edition)]].  Director Peter Weir further avoids Hollywood clich&eacute;s by not engaging in excessive special effects during battle scenes, leaving out the dramatic fireballs that pervade the action genre, in favor of much more realistic explosions, damage, and injuries.  Russell Crowe shines in his role as Captain Aubrey in much the same way that he excelled in his role in 'Gladiator.'  The audience is able, through this movie, to experience the same awe and wonderment as those of the period must have experienced upon discovering all of the treasures in the New World.  Peter Weir's directorial prowess enables him to sail 'Master and Commander' into a level of distinction which will no doubt usher it into a place in the Best Picture category of next year's award ceremonies.  'Master and Commander' is one of the year's better films and certain to please audiences everywhere.ector Peter Weir further avoids Hollywood clichés by not engaging in excessive special effects during battle scenes, leaving out the dramatic fireballs that pervade the action genre, in favor of much more realistic explosions, damage, and injuries.

B00005JMEW|4.0|Quentin Tarantino's fourth film, 'Kill Bill,' shows how significantly he has matured as a director from his previous work in Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and [[ASIN:B000068DBD Jackie Brown (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]]. Tarantino's improvements have been quite grand over his relatively short career in Hollywood, going from a very gritty and rough beginning with Reservoir Dogs, to continuous refinement in his followups, to 'Kill Bill, vol. 1,' which is very nearly a perfect homage to the kung fu movies of the 1970s. After having been severely beaten and then shot by Bill and his Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, Uma Thurman wakes up in a hospital, having been in a coma for four years. Her would-be husband has been killed, and presumably, her unborn child is also gone. She embarks on a mission of revenge, which, in volume one, focuses on the characters played by Vivica A. Fox, and Lucy Liu. Thurman, Fox, and Liu, all play their parts exceptionally well, but with the exception of Liu, all have acted in other Tarantino films, so their performances are not unexpected in terms of quality. Uma Thurman's character, known only as the Black Mamba, bests her foes in the true spirit of the kung fu movie genre, and includes the addition of some of the special touches expected by Quentin's fans. Volume two is set for release next year, and, it seems safe to assume, will feature Daryl Hannah's and Michael Madsen's characters more prominently.<br />In terms of directorial prowess, Tarantino is definitely taking his place among the truly great directors in the world of film. From the very strong, but immatured promise he showed with 'Reservoir Dogs,' much has been expected from him, and to his credit, he has delivered time and again with an ever-improving final product. [[ASIN:1558908242 Pulp Fiction]] certainly showed a marked improvement over [[ASIN:B000MGZVWY Reservoir Dogs (1992)]], but Tarantino's sometimes awkward, and occasionally unnatural character dialogue took away from 'Pulp Fiction's overall greatness. These early mistakes have served as lessons learned by Mr. Tarantino, however, as 'Kill Bill' is very nearly perfect in terms of its dialogue, writing, acting, directing, cinematography, and general nod to the classic kung fu movies that he seems to love. The homage aspects of 'Kill Bill' have been covered by critics quite thoroughly, but what seems to be underappreciated is the director's other strong influences, like the early Charlie's Angels work, and the James Bond series of films. Both of these areas play a very strong role in the overall tone and style of the movie, and it is important to note them lest all the trouble Tarantino has gone to in including them go to waste on his audiences. The RZA's soundtrack to this film is impressive to say the least. The music is absolutely perfect in its fitting the scenes and is something of which to take note when seeing this film. Anime is even included for the first time of note in a major, primarily non-animated, feature-length movie, and it is used very effectively. Tarantino certainly still has his strong ambitions toward bringing the unusual to the film-going public.<br /><br />The bottom line is that 'Kill Bill' is definitely Quentin Tarantino's best film to date and should be seen in the theaters by everyone who will not immediately condemn it because of its violent content. If the violence can be endured by the audience, they will be rewarded with viewing a truly great film and a very strong desire to see 'Kill Bill, vol. 2' when it arrives in theaters next year.Pulp Fiction's overall greatness.

B0002F6BRE|3.0|'Elf' is a wholesome holiday comedy that tells us the story of a human raised by elves at the North Pole.  Buddy, skillfully played by Will Ferrell, is mistakenly brought back to the workshop after crawling into Santa's toy bag.  He is adopted by Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) and raised like an elf until he discovers that he's actually a human.  His child-like optimism, even at his character's 30 years of age is corny, but charming.  Buddy is more than three times the size of any of the real elves, and without the inherent toy-making skills, has never managed to find his place among them.  He decides to seek out his biological father (James Caan) in New York City; an executive with the children's book division of a major publishing firm.  Buddy's father is a modern-day Scrooge, caring for only money and neglecting everything else, which has resulted in a distancing between himself and his other son, and an utter lack of appreciation for Christmas.  It falls to Buddy to win the acceptance of his family, the love of his girlfriend, and use his innocent simplicity to help return the Christmas spirit to New York.<br /><br />Will Ferrell's performance as Buddy is what really sets the movie apart and makes it something more than a generic holiday film.  Ferrell's unique blend of physical comedy and brilliantly-delivered lines is something that will please audiences of both children and adults.  He seems destined for the kind of fame early [[ASIN:B000JLQPYK Saturday Night Live - The Complete First Season]] actors like Chevy Chase, Dan Akroyd, and Steve Martin achieved in movies.  Unlike so many of his fellow SNL cast members, he is relying on his talent, rather than a single comedy sketch, to propel him out of television and into the cinema.  Director Jon Favreau combines the classic, if generally overused, plot of an innocent outsider brought to live in a barbaric foreign environment with the comedic brilliance of Ferrell to create this modern Christmas classic.  Bob Newhart, James Caan, and Ed Aston as Santa Clause, all play their supporting roles to perfection.  'Elf' is a light-hearted romp through the magic of the spirit of Christmas.  The characters are well developed, the humor is wholesome, the acting is strong, and the story is charming.  The wholesome laughter is innocent enough to keep the children entertained, and edgy enough to still keep the adults laughing too.  This is a movie destined for a spot in the annual lineup of classic holiday films and is well-worth the price of a movie ticket.Caan, and Ed Aston as Santa Clause, all play their supporting roles to perfection.

B000009DUY|5.0|One wonders what people will say about John Williams in, say, the year 2050. The man just keeps producing scores that, if it were possible, surpass the prior one in elegance, emotional weight, and sheer, gorgeous, spellbinding beauty?<br /><br />Gushing?<br /><br />I don't think so. Listen to this soundtrack before you conclude that this reviewer has gone out-of-his-mind starry.<br /><br />Williams embellishes a great movie with a superlative soundtrack that is memorable not for its fireworks but for its muscular, toned way of holding back. In producing this kind of restrained aural backdrop for PRIVATE RYAN, the composer makes his contribution to the magnificent dignifying of the American soldiers' sacrifice in WWII that raises the film above the genre of war flicks to a level where it partakes of something greater than clever description.<br /><br />Listen to the trumpets. Luxuriate in the never completely absent tympanic presence. Hear the snare, Williams' one token of martial thematics, over and over again, reminding us that this is war as much as it is music.<br /><br />Leave room for tears. Williams' score elevates the souls but will not allow one to forgo the tears. Just listen. And weep if you must.
B00008EY65|3.0|'Hellboy' is a watchable follow-up to [[ASIN:B0007WFX62 The Blade Trilogy (Blade/ Blade II/ Blade: Trinity)]] from director Guillermo del Toro starring Ron Perlman and Selma Blair supported by John Hurt.  Rasputin, the ultra-sketchy freak who was an advisor to the Russian royal family around the turn of the century finds himself in a similar capacity to Hitler during the war where he attempts to summon a demon of sorts from some kind of portal, ostensibly in order to help Hitler's war effort, but more accurately because he's a dick and wants to end the world and create some kind of Larry Flynt-style Eden.  The US Army intervenes, captures Hellboy (Ron Perlman) and raises him to protect the United States from the apparently large number of monsters who are rampaging unchecked.  When Hellboy's adopted father (John Hurt) is killed by Rasputin, whose ability to not die is a notable accomplishment, he embarks upon an action-packed journey to set things right and in the process ensure that the process begun by Rasputin during World War II does not succeed.<br /><br />With that explanation, it should be noted that this film is more fun than serious.  The actors, writers, and even director have tried to take a comic book and adapt it to film, but at the same time to have a lot of fun.  Del Toro ensures there is plenty of action, impressive and not overused special effects, and a wholesome sense of humor throughout the picture.  'Hellboy' tries not to take itself very seriously like lesser quality films adapted from comic books like [[ASIN:B000AYELVA X-Men (Widescreen Edition)]], [[ASIN:B0002XK190 Spider-Man / Spider-Man 2 (Widescreen Special Editions)]], and [[ASIN:B00005JKC3 Hulk (Widescreen 2-Disc Special Edition)]].  Guillermo took this project on after passing on directing both \\"Blade: Trinity,\\" and \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,\\" in order to direct this picture and that gamble seems to have paid off.<br /><br />While 'Hellboy' definitely exceeds the very small expectations many had for it, it should be noted that it is by no means perfect and fails in several respects by not sufficiently developing some of the secondary characters, has some awkward situations, and some of the humor is a bit too goofy.  This film is definitely one to see in the theaters; expect a fun bit of humor and some really well-done action scenes and try not to overanalyze it.  Accept it for what it is and you'll find enjoyment with it, and make sure you stay past the credits to see the extra scene del Toro put there.s many had for it, it should be noted that it is by no means perfect and fails in several respects by not sufficiently developing some of the secondary characters, has some awkward situations, and some of the humor is a bit too goofy.

B00004SYWZ|4.0|I stumbled onto this album while searching for a song I heard on Smallville, \\"I Wish I Cared.\\" I was disappointed that I couldn't get it on iTunes, but really glad in the long run, because I discovered this great album.     I don't know why A-HA songs tend to have the strangest lyrics, but the music is beautiful. It's a rarity to get a CD that you love in whole. I have been wearing this one out, and the more I listen, the more I like it.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|The Butterfly Effect is the must-see directorial debut from directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber, who worked previously together as a screenwriting team for [[ASIN:B00005JLZK Final Destination 2]].  Ashton Kutcher, made famous by his role on [[ASIN:B000TLTCTA That '70s Show - Season 7]], stars in this film as Evan Treborn, a man who periodically blacks out due to a rare neural disorder he shares with his institutionalized father.  Evan and his best friend Kayleigh Miller (Amy Smart from [[ASIN:B00003CXIY Road Trip (Unrated Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B00005RYLX Rat Race (Special Collector's Edition)]]), her brother Tommy (William Lee Scott), and Lenny (Eldon Henson), grow up in a hellish childhood environment and are all traumatized by a childhood incident where a woman and her baby are killed very gruesomely.  In an effort to help him recall blacked out memories, Evan begins to keep meticulous journals of his daily life.  Later, while reading the journals in college he discovers that, in addition to helping him remember the blacked out events, he finds he has the ability to change the incidents in question.  Evan begins trying to better the lives of his group of friends by changing the incidents he believes lead to their later depression, institutionalization, suicides, imprisonment, and general harm.  He soon discovers that every change he makes has grand consequences that often only worsen his friends' fates.<br /><br />Concisely put, the only element missing from 'The Butterfly Effect,' is a more effective soundtrack.  Bearing that in mind, this film is a phenomenal journey through the lives of this group of friends and even with that minor flaw, it remains a gleaming treasure. While 'The Butterfly Effect' is an incredibly impressive film, Amy Smart's performance is particularly noteworthy as it really brings the raw emotional feeling of regret that permeates the film's style and story.  Her character's ever more dramatic tragedy is portrayed by Smart brilliantly.  This film has successfully brought Smart out of her supporting role shell and into her fuller potential as a great actress.<br /><br />One might expect Ashton Kutcher to be a limiting factor in the overall quality of this film, but he is surprisingly competent in a more serious role and, while his performance doesn't compare with Smart's, he is able to hold his own.  The most important aspect of this film is definitely the direction.  The same raw emotional tension that was infused into the trailer is present throughout 'The Butterfly Effect,' which only serves to draw the viewer ever deeper into the storyline.  Directors Bress and Gruber's contribution combines a solid script, several great performances, and an emotional style of filming, skilled direction, and special effects that nicely compliment the story.  If you see only one movie this semester, make it 'The Butterfly Effect,' and experience exceptional filmmaking.film has successfully brought Smart out of her supporting role shell and into her fuller potential as a great actress.

B000RG1FMO|5.0|One thing that definitely stands out when listening to Kanye's latest opus, its that the EGO has morphed into something out of this world. Song titles like  `Champion', `Stronger', `The Glory' & `Can't Tell Me Nothing' tell the story. This man is full of himself.<br /><br />That alone will turn off a few listeners, which is a shame because this is a great album. As the story goes, Kanye was influenced by touring with the likes of U2 and wanted to craft an album that did not only sound great in your car stereo but would also sound great performed in front of a 30'000 strong stadium crowd (Like the U2 albums).<br /><br />Songs like `Big Brother', `Good Life' & `Stronger' just beg to be blared out of 50'000 watt stadium sound systems with a sound is as much Pop as it is Hip-Hop. The hooks are simple but very catchy & the guests are kept to an absolute minimum (I guess you can't always take them with you on tour). Kanye's vision of \\"Stadium Status (Music)\\", also had an impact on the lyrics as there are no attempts at lyrical gymnastics as on `Diamonds Are Forever', the focus here is on rhythm & flow (accompanied by some sick one liners)<br />- \\"Have you ever popped champagne on a plane while getting some br@#$s, whipped it out she said I never seen snakes on a plane\\" - Good Life<br />Songs like `I Wonder' and `Drunk & Hot Girls' are more akin to spoken word than rap songs and if you are familiar to Kanye's rants you know it this not a bad thing at all as they are funny as hell. While the lyrics are generally `dumb down' and the subject matter is not meant to challenge, the concept on 'Big Brother' is very original.<br /><br />There are familiar moments as with `Good Morning' which is a `Late Registration' throwback in its simplicity and poignancy. Later on Kanye also borrows from `College Dropout' on `The Glory' which features a sped up soul loop & violins (remember Miri Ben Ari). Both are very well executed and do not sound dated at all. The rest of the album has Electronica, Reggae, Rock & Pop influences. 'Flashing Lights' is a definite highlight and so is 'Champion', Kanye even wins with his collaboration with the over exposed T-Pain.<br /><br />Execution is the key to the success of the album and Kanye is a perfectionist (see original version of 'Stronger'). The album is the perfect closer to the college themed trilogy. Kanye has grown from a producer who can rap (College Dropout) to a rapper musician (Late registration) to an Entertainer (who deserves to share a stage with U2, Michael Jackson Rolling Stones etc)uences.

B0001BKAEY|2.0|'The Matrix: Revolutions' is the final installment of the Wachowski brothers' Matrix trilogy which, when viewed on its own merit is a remarkable action movie, but of very poor quality when considered in its proper role as the final episode of this modern epic.  In Revolutions, which is set to take place immediately after the conclusion of [[ASIN:B0000AXE8I The Matrix Reloaded (Widescreen Edition)]], Neo is in an apparent coma, having been imprisoned by a rogue program, somewhere between the Matrix and the computer network that lies outside of it.  Trinity and Morpheus must free Neo from his state of mental imprisonment so that Neo can rescue Zion from the imminent and massive attack from the machines that was only hours away in Reloaded.  Smith, the agent Neo destroyed in The 'Matrix,' continues to gain power so that he begins to not only threaten the Matrix, but Zion and the machine civilization in the real world, as well.  Neo is forced to make a series of important choices in how to best proceed so that evil is defeated, Zion is saved, and humanity is finally freed from its invisible state of bondage.<br /><br />Written and directed by Larry and Andy Wachowski, 'Revolutions' unfortunately continues the disappointing trend begun in Reloaded where nicely mixed classical philosophy is blended with the modern world and the role of technology as a storyline, combined with amazing direction, innovative camera techniques, and wonderful coloring, is abandoned in favor of a painfully-lengthy series of very contrived fight scenes and little in the way of plot or philosophy.  While the heavy use of special effects continues in Revolutions, their effect is to only enhance the action portrayed, rather than to help further the plot.  Essentially, what the audience is left with is dependent upon what they expect from this movie.  For those who wanted to see a grand capstone to the saga of Neo  told in the same spirit as [[ASIN:B00000K19E The Matrix]] there is only disappointment, as the Wachowski brothers have once again failed to capture the same energy, innovation, and intellectual appeal present in the original film, instead resorting to a weak plot and lots of special effects.  For those who wanted to see a very good action movie, their expectations will be met, and likely exceeded.  If the inconsistencies in plot, lack of intellectual content, clich&eacute;d dialog, and disappointing understanding of history (the machine city has its very own Maginot Line that worked so poorly for France during World War II) can be ignored, The Matrix: Revolutions may be enjoyed as nothing more than a remarkable action movie.<br /><br />If these issues are the antithesis of what appealed to you about The Matrix, do not bother wasting your money to see this film in the theaters; wait for it to be released in video stores.the Wachowski brothers have once again failed to capture the same energy, innovation, and intellectual appeal present in the original film, instead resorting to a weak plot and lots of special effects.

B000077VR3|5.0|The third and final installment of Baz Luhrmann's [[ASIN:B0000682UD Baz Luhrmann's Red Curtain Trilogy (Strictly Ballroom / Romeo + Juliet / Moulin Rouge)]] trilogy is the first musical in recent memory to capture public notice. 'Moulin Rouge' is the story of a young writer named Christian (Ewan McGregor) trying to get a break in 1899 Paris. The focus of the Bohemian community in which he resides, is a nightclub called the M'oulin Rouge,' where Satine (Nicole Kidman) is a dancing courtesan that wishes to become a great actress, but suffers from a serious disease. The great switch of the 'Moulin Rouge' from nightclub to theater is dependent on a duke's (Richard Roxburgh) financing. A comical sequence of events leads to Christian and Satine falling in love, but being put under enormous pressure, as the financing of the theater conversion is dependent upon Satine remaining the mistress of The Duke. 'Moulin Rouge' is built on a very simple, almost Shakespearean plot, but with the addition of Baz Luhrmann's touches, is made into so much more.<br /><br />One's first impression of 'Moulin Rouge' is that of a passionate assault on the viewer's senses. Bright, vivid colors, intricate sets, skillfully designed costumes, incredible music and songs, are all carefully shaped by the director into a magnificent example of how well the medium of film can be used to enhance a musical. Despite 'Moulin Rouge's lackluster reception by cinema audiences, the quality remains there waiting for the viewer to discover. It should be noted that many of the current film-going generation have never seen a musical and that lack of experience may have lead to a souring of their tastes for the film. The recent success of subsequent Hollywood musical adaptions suggests that this attitude is no longer so prevalent and it is likely that if 'Moulin Rouge' had premiered in this environment, it would have received a great deal more praise from critics and audiences alike. In spite of these issues, director Baz Luhrmann has handed down to the film-going public a movie which takes the best aspects of a musical, with the best aspects of motion pictures, to create something very special and worthy of close inspection by those who appreciate either a musical or a stylistically magnificent movie.<br /><br />Little known, but very important in understanding why 'Moulin Rouge' came into being is Baz Luhrmann's loose trilogy of films, exploring the various methods of expression in films, other than traditional dialogue. [[ASIN:B00005V1Y0 Strictly Ballroom]] was the first in the series from Luhrmann and dealt with the expressive qualities of dance. Audiences failed to latch onto this en masse, but it carved for itself a very specific and important niche in modern cinematic history. In 1996 Luhrmann explored poetry and prose as methods of expression for his actors in his retelling of Shakespeare's classic, and perennial Hollywood favorite, [[ASIN:B000060OFT William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet (Special Edition)]], albeit with some of the modern adaptions to the classic storyline that fans of Luhrmann have come to expect from him. The final installment of the series is the great leap into the realm of music and song, and comes from a more mature and experienced director, leading to a seamless weaving of a classic storyline, with breathtaking sets and visual style, an amazingly perfect ensemble of actors and musicians, and an absolutely unbelieveable soundtrack to create nothing less than the greatest filmed musical since the 1960s.uhrmann has handed down to the film-going public a movie which takes the best aspects of a musical, with the best aspects of motion pictures, to create something very special and worthy of close inspection by those who appreciate either a musical or a stylistically magnificent movie.

B000HWXO4U|5.0|This is a great collection of videos.  Good for new fans, as a gift, and even good for old fans.  It is a great overview of the most popular work (and videos) from dm.  I would help the previous commentor and give a track listing, but frankly I'm too lazy to go downstairs and get it, and he/she should learn to use a search engine.  Also, very tasteless to give a bad review on a product when you are aiming at Amazon for not giving a track listing.  Get it straight.
0385720920|1.0|I slogged through this tedious, ugly story hoping that there would be, as I found at the end of Fight Club, some redemption in it; --some payoff at the end that would justify the time spent listening to Palahniuk's interminable compendium of  abject filth, sordid sick-mindedness, and general depravity.    Alas, there was no payoff. It was a journey to nowhere, offering only a vivid view of  ugly, trashy scenery along the way.     What a waste of time and effort it was to sit through this insipid book. You could accomplish the same effect without spending the money by going out tonight and rolling in a gutter!
0694003611|5.0|I love all of the Margaret Wise Brown books. And this one is no exception. There is so much to look at. Only enough energy to read the words? Fine, a soothing rhythmic lullaby. More energy? There is enough in the book to keep you going for at least a half hour looking at engaging characters, sleepy kitties, curious mice and warm mittens that have dried in front of the fire. Although I agree with a reviewer that the sudden disappearance of the quiet old lady is creepy and fodder for a Dr. Who episode. Otherwise, a great kids book.
B000TUXL2A|5.0|Rarely do I enjoy every song on a CD from beginning to end, but this one is an exception.  The ballad-like lyrics stay with me long after the CD stops playing.  This CD is enjoyable, upbeat, easy listening.  The lyrics are printed inside the cover, so it's fun to sing along, too.
B000UCEJEQ|2.0|So far, I've been a bit disapointed in this album. The first track and maybe one or two others are quite charming. Other than that, I find the lyrics to be very, very, Annie. Her lyric writing feels to similar between these songs, and other Annie songs on other Annie albums.     I really, really, really, hate and detest the AIDS awareness song! Really. It's good that she's commited to a cause, but I don't think doing a BAD song about the cause is a good way for her to make any gains in the area.    I must admit I kind of hate cheesey \\"cause\\" songs, so...I may not be the most impartial here. But, as cheesey \\"cause\\" songs go...this one is poor, even for the genre.  Lyrically, it reminds me of \\"Sisters Are Doin' It For Themselves\\". That's what I was talking about before, the lyrics here sound like a rehash of every other Annie song.    Oddly, I find the lyrical content of this particular song way too direct and preachy and intelectually boring. Annie usually buries the meanings of her songs in layers of deep metaphor.  The gimick of all the other famous females doesn't really come accross. The track doesn't really highlight anyone elses performance. The melody is poor, trite, and uninspiring and the goofy intro just comes off as another gimick.    I loved Diva and Bare, this album just isn't there. I will admit though, I might have quite a different opinion in six months.  Annie has been one of those artists who's new music usually has to grow and grow and grow on me.

B00005214X|5.0|Simply put - my favorite album ever. From George's gentle voiced opening of \\"All I have is yours...\\", he takes a chance and lays open his beliefs for the world. A good 80% of the songs involve spiritual or inspirational themes.  As a Western follower of Buddhist philosophy, I consider this my album of \\"gospel music.\\" While George wrote the songs from a different perspective, the themes are universal, and this is my musical reminder.  I've played it so much in the car, it's become part of our family jargin \\"Sshhh, you're giving Mommy a Wah-wah.\\" It's also my favorite to sing along with in the shower - try starting your day chanting along with George to \\"My Sweet Lord\\" for a happy outlook.     For the stories behind the songs and a listing of the beautiful lyrics, I recommend George's book \\"I, Me, Mine\\"     For those of you unfamiliar with the album, a short review:    1 - \\"I'd Have You Anytime\\" - Good mellow opener - cowritten with Bob Dylan  2 - \\"My Sweet Lord\\" - One of George's more famous songs - known for the Hare Krishna mantra chant toward the end - that is George overdubbed many times chanting.  3 - \\"Wah-Wah\\" - one of two rockers on the album written after a tough day with Paul McCartney at Apple.  4 - \\"Isn't it a Pity\\" - Long version of the hit song (long instrumental ending)- shorter version follows on disc 2.    5 - \\"What is Life\\" - Happy upbeat tune that was my first introduction to this fine album.  6 - \\"If Not For You\\" - another Dylan tune with Dylan-esque styling  7 - \\"Behind That Locked Door\\" -  country style tune with pedal steel guitar.  8 - \\"Let it Down\\" - big Phil Specter style song - see below for further comment  9 - \\"Run of the Mill\\" - nice inspirational song - mentioned by George's wife Olivia Harrison as one of her favorites    New tracks for 2001 reissue  10 - \\"I Live For You\\" - another country style pedal steel guitar song   11 - \\"Beware of Darkness\\" - nice accoustic demo version - George's voice is in fine shape with some improvised lyrics12 - \\"Let it Down\\" - acoustic stripped down version of the song -played on a nice sound system, gives the feel that George is in the room playing and singing in person  13 - \\"What is Life\\" - instrumental version featuring horn section  14 - \\"My Sweet Lord 2000\\" - George's re-recording of the song a year before his death.  Good to hear him still talking the talk(and walking the walk) 30 years later.    Disc 2  1 - \\"Beware of Darkness\\" - Inspirational tune - beware of negativity and delusions  2 - \\"Apple Scruffs\\" - cute ode to the Apple Scruffs - the girls that would hang outside the Apple offices 24/7  3 - \\"Balad of Sir Frankie Crisp\\" - very pleasant tribute to the designer of George's estate home and garden at Friar Park  4 - \\"Awaiting on You All\\" - about Japa Yoga meditation (chanting on beads)   5 - \\"All Things Must Pass\\" - my favorite song and my personal mantra. Beautiful flow about impermanence  6 - \\"I Dig Love\\" - Simple 60's style tune  7 - \\"Art of Dying\\" - another rocker - living a right life and rebirth covered here  8 - \\"Isn't it a Pity\\" - shorter, more radio friendly version  9 - \\"Hear Me Lord\\" - beautiful heartfelt prayer by George seeking to rise above life's desires.  What a man.    Disc 3 -  1 - It's Johnny's Birthday\\" -catchy happy birthday number supposedly written for Lennon, but I can't recall where I read this   - Remaining songs - Instrumental jams featuring George, Eric Clapton and friends. Probably most intersting to fellow guitarists.
B000Y179KO|2.0|For someone who was a HUGE fan of The Eagles in the 70's, I approached this album with some trepidation.  I'd loved the band in all it's incarnations, even minus Randy Meisner who was a vocalist easily on par with Henley and Frey.  Joe Walsh was a great addition to the band and upped their rock quotient considerably.  But losing Don Felder took a large chunk out of this band, based on this album.  It just sort of sits there.  There ARE some good ballads here and the voices are all on point. The problem is the energy.  Or rather the lack of energy.  I didn't hear a really strong melody on either CD.  And for an Eagles album, that's a crime of the highest nature.  There also aren't any real rockers on this album.  Nothing to compare to Already Gone or James Dean or even Good Day In Hell.  This album sounds like what I guess it is.  A bunch of middle aged men sitting around with not much new to say.  I remember reading a quote by someone in the band a long time ago saying that their intention with every album was to make every single song an excellent tune with no filler.  I wished they'd maintained that standard.  Twenty eight years is a long time to wait for something this average.

Be it the 15 minute guitar solo in the middle of my favorite song, or the completely different sound than the album version, they have always left me cold.<br /><br />Throw all of that out the window with Rush in Rio.  This is an incredible CD and it flows with an energy unlike any other album I've ever heard.  All it will take to prompt you to purchase this is the track \\"Driven\\".  I heard this track on Pandora (and of course on Test For Echo) and was hooked.<br /><br />The only drawback is the lack of \\"Subdivisions\\", but that's a personal preference.<br /><br />Reward yourself, and your CD collection, and pick up Rush in Rio---you won't be disappointed!
B000GFLE1S|4.0|Joel Edgerton stars as Charlie Price in this uncommon movie about a fourth-generation shoe maker who inherits a failing business. Charlie wanted nothing to do with shoe making until his father's death fills him with a new sense of duty. His girlfriend thinks he is crazy for being loyal to his father's business when his father wasn't loyal enough in the first place to tell him that the business stopped being profitable. There was no longer a market for such fine craftsmanship, demand had changed. How far will Charlie go to save the family business? And would his ancestors be proud to see what might come of their shoe factory?     The cast was filled with subtle actors who played subtle characters. The drab \\"backdrop\\" wasn't necessary to enable Chiwetel Ejiofor to stand out, but it did serve that purpose. Ejiofor, to use as much irony as I can muster, plays the \\"knight in shining armor\\" who just might be able to help Charlie save his factory. He plays Lola, the lavish drag queen who croons for packed houses of adoring fans at night and now saves shoe factories during the day. Ejiofor delivers one of the must surprising and entertaining performances, which included singing in many scenes.     Kinky Boots is not edge-of-your-seat excitement, nor is it an action-packed thriller. It has its flaws, but it is a charming movie that is worth seeing and I really enjoyed it.

The drum & bass rhythms don't even match. As an avid concert tape collector, I for one would like the complete soundboard tape(s) released with all of Plant's back & forth banter with the audience and no edits whatsoever, cleaned up sonicaly in the mastering process of course. That's what should have been done. People want to know what it was like to be at a Zep concert 35 years ago. This release fails to do that.
1596003251|5.0|Lee Childs main caracter Jack Reacher is a former Military Police Officer, who it appears liked the Army but was a bit too much for them. He is big, super tough and has a personal integrity that brings one back in memory to the super heroes of childhood. He is a loner, who lives day to day wihtout the need of closets full of clothes or a permanent residence. This helps to give the reader a colorful caracter developement of Jack Reacher as an unususal, but likeable hero, unique in his choices.     The story begins in lower Manhattan with a series of coinsidences that bring him into contact with a contract miliitary mercenary unit leader who has appearantly been the victim of a kidnap for ransome of his wife and child. For his own reasons, Jack deciedes to look into it and turns his many skills to that effort.     The resulting adventure is action packed, with the introoduction of a series of caracters and senarioes, that take us from swank apartments to African prison camps. It is to the writers skill that these transistions are done in story and so smoothly that they seem normal.    This is epic adventure, mixed with mystery and romance that holds one's attention throughout. To Lee Child fans it is another great Jack reacher adventure, to the new reader it is a complete book in itself as opposed to a series chapter. Well writen and well read.

B000W1V5VU|3.0|This film hums along at an even pace, pokes fun at itself and makes sure that *we* know that *they* know that it's an on-purpose dumb caper film, an homage to various goofball '50/'60s flicks like Our Man Flynt, Mad Mad Mad World and (of course) all the Rat Pack films... It's okay... some clever bits, lots of lavish set design, many wry, detached comedic performances.  Ultimately, though, it's a boring film -- there's no real suspense and the \\"Mission Impossible\\" mechanics are so preposterous -- and poorly explained -- that even the geek-out factor falls flat.  This was mildly entertaining, but there are a lot of other, better films to watch that deliver more bang for your buck.  (Axton)
B000OVLBGC|5.0|Besides being an excellent film with all aspects - thrill and passion - it also gives an insight on what really went on behind the iron curtain.  It helps to realize that not all people in the communist world were pro-communist. And it may help raise awareness and compassion for people that are still fighting in still communist countries.
B000W4KT64|3.0|I've now seen this story in three forms--the Broadway musical, which I loved, even at $110 per ticket; the'80s Hairspray movie on DVD; and the 2007 theatrical release. The current movie musical follows the path of the Broadway musical, keeping most of the songs and adding a couple others. Nikki Blonsky, the young actress who plays the indomitable Tracy Turnblad, is terrific, but much of the adult cast suffers from star-studdedness, primarily in the Latex-laden form of John Travolta as Tracy's mom, Edna Turnblad. The use of a male actor is the role isn't unprecedented. Actually, it's the standard, as transvestite actress Divine played the role in the '80s movie, and a variety of overweight male actors have played the role on Broadway. Still, big screen size and HD-clarity on made-up pores in Travolta face and petrochemical molecules in his fat suit distracted me from enjoying \\"Hairspray\\" as much as I could. (He did do a good job researching and trying to maintain a Baltimore accent.)<br /><br />Supporting roles were filled with non-singing stars as well--particularly Michelle Pfeiffer as Velma Von Tussle; Christopher Walken as jokester father Wilbur Turnblad. The romantic song and dance featuring Travolta and Walken is pretty hard to watch. Still, the DVD costs a lot less than a Broadway ticket, and you get to hear the incomparable opening number, \\"Good Morning, Baltimore,\\" and the rousing closing number \\"You Can't Stop The Beat,\\" along with some energetic singing and dancing from younger and less famous members of the cast, which is more entertainment than a lot of movies offer. This one might even be better on the small screen, where Travolta's Edna won't be quite so enormously alarming. Three stars.

0321344758|5.0|This book are useful to anyone planning any sort of process which other people will use -- not just web pages.<br /><br />I bought this book because I was working on a related problem for a consulting firm -- how to integrate research and documentation of said research. The insights from this book into how people use a computer-based system allowed me to identify what was wrong with all of the proposed solutions -- such as software designed to handle references, like EndNote. The proposed solutions were too complex, requiring too much new learning and too many steps.<br /><br />In the end we saved thousands of dollars by developing a very simple set of rules for putting together an excel spreadsheet for gathering and sourcing qualitative information -- easy to open, easy to operate, everyone already knows how to use the software.<br /><br />The book was most useful because I was able to wave it in the air and announce \\"people won't use that feature\\" as we discussed different options. It was an antidote to the common tendency to feel that our co-workers \\"aught\\" or \\"should\\" do their work in a particular fashion. E.g. \\"Since documentation is important, people should be willing to spend some time doing it.\\"
B00005JPS9|2.0|I absolutely adore CGI, moreso when CGI attempts to imitate real life. Having studied the original text of Beowulf for about five minutes, many years ago, I remember being decidedly underwhelmed by the epic poem - it just didn't capture my imagination - but I thought, well, the trailer for this movie looks astounding, and the moviemakers will probably have made some story changes to the original to lend it a more movie-friendly aspect.    Sadly, none of the above really applies to this movie version of \\"Beowulf\\".     Judging this as a movie in its own right, irrespective of the original poem, it's not very good. The first problem is with the visuals: Zemeckis' direction is excellent, really tense and exciting - but what he's showing us in these tense and exciting shots sort of looks a bit like a high-end episode of \\"Thunderbirds\\". It strikes me as most odd that they can make demons ooze slime and fire and water mimic reality to perfection... ...but they can't manage some simple facial animation? Mouths don't open properly, facial expressions are decidedly under-animated and many movements are glaringly out-of-place in their artificiality. Oh, and Grendel's mother: golden blow-up doll with organic stiletto heels and gravity-ignoring bosoms? What a joke.    But stop! I hear you cry - this IS a cartoon, right?     Wrong. \\"Beowulf\\" is trying its damnedest to look like reality: but when the sub-par Shrek The Third-style townspeople come along, the illusions of beautiful lighting and exquisitely crafted sets shatter, and we're very much aware that, at least visually, we're being cheated out of a proper connection with these characters.    A sidebar: How is seeing a human penis, taken in context with the rest of the human body in motion, more upsetting than a malformed yellow pus-oozing demon tearing a screaming human being in half? I don't know the answer to that, but clearly Zemeckis thinks he does: and clearly, he took a good long look at the opening scenes of Austin Powers 2 before storyboarding the Beowulf-Grendel fight sequence in the banquet hall. The strategically-placed swords, soldiers, shadows and other assorted battleground debris to mask Beowulf's nudity actually just looks comical, and really tears the dramatic worth out of this most important of battle scenes. Badly done...    Annihoo, onto the script: or what passes for a script in \\"Beowulf\\". The dialogue here is a sort of mishmash of archaic English, Danish and modern American English, produced in an array of U.S., British, Irish and Danish accents, and it's horribly jarring on the ears. The script itself is standard B-movie action fare (Neil Gaiman was accompanied by Silent Hill's Roger Avary, it's no surprise that parts of it are decidedly sub-par), and the plot, given the limited frame in which it has to work, is straightforward enough: vanilla, there are no surprises and few highs or lows with which to engage the viewer.    The voice talents of the actors are neither brilliant nor awful.     \\"Beowulf\\" is very much a one-trick pony. When it's good, it's because of Zemeckis' breathtaking panoramas and some very well-shot battle sequences. When it's bad, and it is mostly bad, it's because of substandard character animation and some tacky, predictable scripting.     If you're going to see it, see it on the big screen. Don't buy the DVD unless you're a fanatic of computer-generated animation; as a movie \\"Beowulf\\" isn't very entertaining: go watch the Lord of the Rings trilogy again instead.
140120306X|3.0|I'd awaited this eagerly for a long, long time, but when it came, it wasn't what I had been hoping for.  As usual, the in-jokes were a lot of fun (Billy Bunter makes an appearance, as do Bulldog Drummond, James Bond, and many others) but the alternate history had gotten a little weird.  Yes, I know---but having Britain go through a period of dictatorship based on a very well-known novel, and then apparently just go back to where they were before, is a _trifle_ much-ish.<br /><br />The 3-D in the end also didn't please me; I only see out of one eye at a time, so 3-D Does Not Work for me.<br /><br />The materials in the \\"Black Dossier\\" were interesting, though.  Parodies of _Fanny Hill_ and the Bertie Wooster stories are always fun.  And I will admit I did like a lot of stuff about the main frame story, but, honestly, I had hoped for something different.
B00000K19E|5.0|What is The Matrix? Oozing cool, this sci-fi action thriller draws parallels from biblical stories, countless religions and ancient Japanese lore. To say that it must be seen for yourself is no understatement. Revolutionary special effects, spawning dozens of notorious parodies, most notably during a 1999 Super Bowl commercial, ultra hip wardrobes and Gatling gun action firepower, The Matrix single-handedly saved Warner Bros. from a lengthy cinema slump, and put the \\"awesome\\" back in R-rated films and black leather apparel.<br /><br />Neo (Keanu Reeves) is a computer hacker who is plagued by thoughts of the indecipherability of the real world and the dream world. When he is mysteriously contacted by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), an infamous and regaled underworld leader, he follows clues and the shapely messenger Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) to unlock the secrets of the Matrix. To know more would spoil the ingenious and surrealism of this masterful film; needless to say, Neo wanders down the rabbit hole to see how far it goes.<br /><br />Redefining cool, the action and stunts in The Matrix are nothing short of unbelievable. Focusing heavily on carefully choreographed martial arts battles and highflying helicopter stunts, this film will enliven your faith in the action genre.<br /><br />Utilizing slow motion in a dance of magical cinematography, scenes which would otherwise be exceptional are transformed into pure genius. A helicopter shootout on a rooftop with gushing water, blazing bullets, slow motion diving through mid-air, and a plethora of machine-gun bullets kicking out of a mounted Gatling gun so hard and fast that they fall like metal rain, is only one example of stylized action that is truly beyond unique. In perhaps the most famous scene of the franchise, Neo and Trinity march through a heavily guarded security terminal packing dozens of automatic weapons - all in beautiful slow motion. To see the look of shock on the security officers faces as they set off the alarm and open fire on the unsuspecting guards is sheer bliss. What ensues is the gunfight of the 20th century as they defy gravity and blast their way through a hallway loaded with shotgun-toting SWAT troopers.<br /><br />Magnificently blending science-fiction action and a good old-fashioned love story, to delve too deeply into the intricacy of The Matrix is to do it injustice. Complex and well-organized, the multiple colliding themes of betrayal, destiny, fate and hope, help to serve up a scrumptious cinematic dish. The detail-oriented acting and character development is outstanding, and drives the film with sincerity and determination. The sinister Agent Smith, played by Hugo Weaving, is immortalized as one of the greatest screen villains and manages to be cool and collected in a disconcerting manner, and startlingly malevolent in his final confrontation with Neo. Laurence Fishburne's Morpheus is stern, resolute and commanding. Trinity is the anti-femme fatale, lithe and sexy in her shiny black leather and skillfully deadly. These admirable and awe-inspiring characters are intertwined into an intricate world magnificently crafted by the Wachowski Brothers. Their previous feature, Bound, proved they had a knack for eye-pleasing storytelling and characters. The Matrix is inspired by many themes and ideas suggested in Japanese Manga comics, but the way the characters and storyline is depicted is a vision for which they deserve undivided credit.<br /><br />The special effects are particularly noteworthy as brand new technology and CG methods were invented for several of the shocking fight sequences. During the rooftop melee, bullets pierce the air around Neo and he reels backward in an attempt to dodge them. While ripples of waves circulate around the slowed down bullets, the camera circles around him in over 360°. Special features on the DVD supplement The Matrix Revisited delve into the complex camera set up and green screen approach used for this often mimicked shot.<br /><br />Few science-fiction films have been so heavily praised, let alone a film from less than ten years ago. The Matrix spawned two sequels, as well as The Animatrix, a collection of animated films, as well as video games, comics, action figure lines and more. If you haven't seen this film, don't delay - The Matrix is waiting for you.<br /><br />- Mike Massieave been so heavily praised, let alone a film from less than ten years ago.

B000VS6R26|4.0|One of the most epic and monumental productions ever attempted, Titanic soared to the top of the box office charts in 1997. Winning 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture, this grandiose film often takes a lot of heat for catering too much to female crowds, a.k.a. the \\"chick flick\\". However, the historical tale of the doomed monstrosity of the sea packs quite a bit of action, amazing special effects, an excellent score and lavish designs that can appeal to everyone.<br /><br />Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) and his crew of deep-sea treasure hunters investigate the ruins of one of the most famous wreckage sites: the final resting place of the Titanic. When they discover a drawing of a beautiful young woman (Kate Winslet) wearing the \\"Heart of the Ocean\\" diamond, the jewel they've been hunting for, they announce it on the news. Rose, now a 101 year old lady comes forward to claim ownership of the drawing. Fascinated by the thought of uncovering the secrets of the diamond and details about the fateful night of the legendary ship, the crew patiently listens as Rose tells them about her adventure and romance with Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) aboard the unsinkable Titanic.<br /><br />What begins as little more than a treasure hunt quickly turns into a colossal romance on the Atlantic between two unlikely lovers. Their love is consubstantial to many on-screen romances, considering that the boy is poor and the girl is rich. The snobbish mother doesn't want the two to be together, and would rather she marry the wealthy high-class gentlemen Cal Hockley, played by Billy Zane. Zane's character is also quite formulaic, with his constant deplorable acts of pride, hotheadedness and his persistence in underhanded deeds. Kathy Bates plays Molly Brown, the stereotypical kindly older lady who helps Jack fit in so that he can woo Rose. Even Jack and Rose are moderately generic - the naïve young girl who thinks only of ending her life as an escape from her lack of decision-making power, and Jack as the street-smart, carefree, live by the moment scoundrel. The love story is essentially a fairy tale, complete with every character you'd expect to see in such a fantasy.<br /><br />The acting in the film often falters between impressive and horrid, especially as the screenplay reflects obnoxiously insincere comments and jests. With the irony of mentioning Picasso as a hack, not even being recognized by his first name, or Freud as a passenger on the ship, and several hints as to the absence of light and binoculars with which they might have spotted the iceberg, the dialogue is often unpersuasive. Monotone and lethargic at times, Kate Winslet delivers many of her early lines with such noticeable lackluster amateurishness that it seems ludicrous for her to have been nominated for any awards at all. Leonardo DiCaprio is only slightly more authentic, although in all fairness the dialogue feels so modernized and petty that perhaps the actors didn't have much to work with. The captain (Bernard Hill) and the steerage band convey more convincing emotion with little more than glances and stares.<br /><br />For all of its glamour and pizzazz, Titanic is just simply too unnecessarily long. With a running time of over three hours, it seems hardly important to include so much about the older Rose as she narrates the story. If the film had covered only the events of the Titanic during its short journey, not only would the pacing have been better, but the story would have been more involving. Each time the camera cuts back to the old Rose it violently yanks the audience out of the moment and away from the characters they actually care about.<br /><br />What Cameron does still demonstrate admirably is his handling of suspense, and he masterfully shows chaos and panic as the ship begins to sink. Seizure-inducing flashing lights, screaming children and mob mentality violence are all portrayed with great care, and when the Titanic begins to capsize, it is believably unnerving. Great music, seamless special effects and contrasting characters add to the thrills - it's just a shame it takes so long to get to that point.<br /><br />- Mike Massiefects and contrasting characters add to the thrills - it's just a shame it takes so long to get to that point.    - Mike Massie
0525950079|5.0|Back in 1989 I read a wonderful novel by Ken Follett that wasn't his typical spy thriller.  It was \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\" and it was a delightful read for those of us who like historical backing to our novels.  I didn't need Ohpra to tell me to read this and it's a shame she took so long to get to it but now there's a new novel following along the same story line.  \\"World Without End\\" is equally as enjoyable and very hard to put down.  Even though it is over 1000 pages you still don't want it to end which is how I felt with the first novel.  Hope Ken doesn't wait another 19 years to write another.  Buy both and enjoy them!  There worth having in your library!
B000VDDDVO|5.0|One of the most heartwarming and uplifting films ever created, Frank Capra's It's A Wonderful Life perfectly captures the human spirit through faith, love and second chances, and beautifully weaves an unforgettable tale. Essentially a twist on Charles Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol\\", the characters are richly developed and each scene is elegantly directed. Jimmy Stewart displays the purest of human emotions with unbeatable acting, as does the superlative supporting cast including Donna Reed and Lionel Barrymore.<br /><br />In Bedford Falls, George Bailey (James Stewart) contemplates suicide. Through the prayers of countless friends, an angel named Clarence Oddbody (Henry Travers) is sent to Earth to help George in his plight. From here the story backtracks with a narration by Joseph, the head angel, to fill in the details of Bailey's life. As a young boy he saves his brother Harry from drowning, and later after the untimely death of his father, stays in Bedford Falls to help run the Business and Loan Company, started by his father and business partner, Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell), years ago. George desperately wants to leave the small town that he's been cooped up in his whole life, but continually finds himself staying, first to save the business, then to allow his younger brother to go off to college, and finally to wed childhood sweetheart Mary Hatch (Donna Reed). When the conniving Mr. Potter, the richest man in town, who has been trying to buy out the Business and Loan Company his entire life, discovers a banking error that could destroy the fledgling company, George becomes impetuous and is convinced he's worth more dead than alive. \\"Is he sick?\\" asks the angel Clarence. \\"No, worse\\", responds Joseph. \\"He's discouraged\\".<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart turns in a tour de force of Christmas spirit, hope and anguish, and he lights up the screen like few others. His acting is flawless and his emotions utterly genuine. Donna Reed is also exceptional as Mary, the girl who is madly in love with George and content with waiting until he realizes his feelings are reciprocal. It is a timeless romance and an essential part of this film which is often overlooked by the comparisons to Scrooge's revelations in \\"A Christmas Carol\\". The love story is prominent and heartfelt, and while noticeably characterized by the 40's strict sense of decent relationships, an inspiring image that never fades. Lionel Barrymore plays Mr. Potter, the \\"Grinch\\" character who never does receive proper requital, although we are content knowing he never rises above the changeless miserable miser figure he holds throughout the film. He hates everyone who has anything he doesn't have - although money has never been one of those things.<br /><br />And then there's Clarence, the simple angel who is anxious to receive his wings by helping Bailey realize the value of God's greatest gift. Henry Travers portrays Clarence with wonderfully elementary honesty and presents humorous situations of disbelief for George, which quickly turns to panic at the insistence and demonstration of Clarence's guardian angel abilities. Clarence, while only appearing at the very end of the film, is a major player, giving George the chance to see what life would be like in Bedford Falls if he were never born. George spends a great deal of time struggling with disbelief at Pottersville, so renamed because of his absence in preventing Potter from taking over the town. His friends and family don't recognize him, and he is reduced to tears at all of the now indifferent lives he didn't know he had touched. As Clarence points out, it's remarkable to see how many people are influenced by a single individual.<br /><br />Written, produced and directed by the legendary Frank Capra, It's A Wonderful Life created countless poignant and memorable moments and themes that would later be referenced and remembered in future filmmaking. George wants to do big and important things away from Bedford Falls, realizingonly at the conclusion how important it was for him not to accomplish those goals. The broken down Waldorf hotel becomes the home of George and Mary's dreams and even the location for the perfect honeymoon, one that the newlyweds missed out on initially, and George shouting from the top of the very bridge he nearly leapt from: \\"I want to live again!\\" In the end, George is the richest man in town, measured not by his wealth, but by his friends.<br /><br />- Mike Massietant it was for him not to accomplish those goals.

B000UD08HW|4.0|I agree with others here with respect to the video quality however, I think it has less to do with 1080i versus 1080p and more to do with the filtered light, fog machines and camera white level limitations in a darkened Albert Hall.  Unless this DVD is only available in Blu Ray I would pick it up in a standard 480p video format and save some money.  The Dolby 5.1 production is first rate regardless of the video format.  I buy mostly music DVDs and very few movies since I can rent them anytime.  If you are starting an HD library and trying to decide whether to go Blu Ray or HD/DVD this DVD may help you decide.
0553260111|3.0|One of the frustrations I have over thrillers is the lack of interesting and convincing characters as well as character interactions that don't sound like talking heads.  Ludlum, in creating Bourne certainly has a lot of that going on, but he also has one of the most complex, riveting and compelling plot lines with enough twists and turns to practically overcome any weaknesses.    We first find Bourne off the coast of France, as is displayed in both the TV movie and the motion picture with Matt Damon.  He is alone, confused, suffering from total memory loss and having nowhere to go.  Sounds like the movies right?  Sure it does until you tear through the next 400 pages and realize the plot here is infinitely more complex and engaging.  Bourne is a complex character -- and the only one.  He soon meets up with his girlfriend (through a kidnapping of all things) along with a host of players that add to the mystery and confusion.      You have to pay attention to this novel. Every page is trickling information out at you and some are easy to miss.  A character simply called the old-man who communicates with Carlos is revealed how he got that information towards the end of the book but it is a bit subtle if you're not paying attention.  Along the way there are lots of talking heads mainly from US officals who would put a snore on anyone's lips.  Ludlum uses them to advance the plot more than anything else.    Is this book flawed -- you bet?  Does it require a bit of suspension of disbelief -- absolutely, the coincidences and character connections are at times hard to buy into.  Is it a cliff hanger -- yes! Is it worth it -- oh ya.  I read it during my days in bed with a nasty, nasty cold.  It took me three days to crank it out.  It holds you tightly because you have to see how it ends.

0143038419|4.0|This book is very readable and interesting.  At first I wasn 't sure it was worth reading but then found much to learn from the author's insights and willingness to be self revealing.  The first section takes place in Italy and is fun to read. The second section, in India, I liked the best and feel the author, Liz Gilbert, dealt with the issues in her life and in being in the Ashram extremely well.  It didn 't make me want to go to an Ashram but I signed up for a mindfulness meditation series right after finishing the book.  The last section, in Indonesia, is a lovely wrap up.  The author's mix of humor, travel log and spirituality in this memoir is well done.

B000OVLBEO|4.0|I became a fan of the early 90's variation of the ghost rider.  I also became familiar with Johnny Blaze from the story lines where the 90's ghost rider and Blaze shared a title together.    This movie takes the older Johnny Blaze ghost rider and blends it with the spirit of vengence ghost rider of the 90's.  A bit of creative liscense, sure, but it made for a really cool take on the character.  The acting was not as bad as some of the other posters would have you believe.  But do not buy this movie believing it to be a character driven drama that was meant to impress film critics.  This is an action movie.  It is a special effects extravaganza.  The effects deliver!  Is there cheeze? Of course, namely the \\"Yahoo\\" when ghost rider lassos the helicopter.  We could've done without that little bit.  But on the whole, a good flick.  I would say a little better than Electra, not as good as the X-Men, Spiderman movies or Daredevil.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|From the time I viewed the first episode of Gilmore Girls, I was hooked, and the attachment to this beloved show has only grown from strength to strength [yes, even till the less than satisfying final season 7].<br /><br />Season Two sees us revisiting Stars Hollow, the idyllic little Connecticut town that is home to Lorelai Gilmore and her teenage daughter Rory. There are some interesting plot developments in this season - Lorelai gets engaged to Max and faces some dilemmas and inner conflict, Rory's stable relationship with Dean, her long-term boyfriend is threatened by the arrival of Jess, a rebellious teenager from NY who also happens to be Luke's nephew, and of course, the turbulent relationship that Lorelai has with her parents, Richard and Emily Gilmore goes through more upheaval.And Luke gets into some romantic entanglements of his own.<br /><br />There are other interesting developments in this season that make GG an addictive must-watch - Rory's rivalry with Paris Geller, Richard's forced retirement and its aftermath, Christopher's re-entry into the Gilmore girls' lives and many more. The eccentric townspeople of Stars Hollow add to the appeal of the show, Taylor Doose's 'dictatorship' of the town goes to new heights, Kirk's manic antics and many more. All of which, coupled with rapidfire witty dialogue that has become the trademark of the show make Gilmore Girls a rare gem amongst TV series - great casting, excellent scripts and beautiful, scenic sets. A must-watch indeed!
B000WQ9UA8|2.0|This is your guilty pleasure.  Mine too, so I gave it 2 stars.  Forget her voice. She's not supposed to sing in the first place.  She can grunt and squeal and still sound ok.  So here is your 2 stars.  I think this cd will save her sorry a.....s.  May she sound and look the same in her 60's.
B000JJSRNY|4.0|Atmosphere great, singers animated and first rate.  The program consisted of popular musical scores that were easily recognizable--a good idea for large audiences.      The concert took off when the singers performed encores.  It was at this point that the audience became enthusiastic and reacted accordingly.
B000EGEVZK|5.0|if you're a ramones fan don't even wait to read this review, order immediately. this dvd set is that good. it's 4 hours (on 2 dvds) of live ramones mainly from their prime, 1976-81. the sound and video quality ranges from excellent to lousy but don't worry. the whole 4 hours are a raucous, noisy JOY. just as i remember them. take it from someone who was there, THIS IS THE REAL DEAL! tommy (erdelyi) ramone was the musical director on this project and obviously a lot of work went into it. if your ANY kind of rock&roll fan this set is a must. i'll bet if any of my old friends who told me THE RAMONES suck or THE RAMONES should be shot check this out now they'll have to admit that THE RAMONES were pretty damn good. us fans know they were WAY better than that, they were bleepin' GREAT! 10 stars.
B000002UAU|5.0|When you hear this album, you will be so amazed at the experimental level of the beatles. This album is not equal to any album you have heard and you will find that many groups have been very influence by these tracks. This is the beatles at their best. Excellent from begining to end. Highly recomended.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|Season Three of the Gilmore Girls is one of the best of all seven seasons. In this season, Rory [Alexis Bledel] is in her final year at Chilton private school and faces some of the most trying times, be it manouvering political games within the student body, or the love triangle between her, Dean [Jared Padalecki] and Jess [Milo Ventimiglia]. Alexis Bledel does a wonderful job in this season and truly shows her maturing as an actress.<br /><br />Of course, Lorelai [Lauren Graham] continues to shine in her role as a single mom, best friend to her daughter, and aspiring inn owner. Lorelai, fresh from the romantic disappointments of the previous two seasons finds herself sort of lost, and dates around, never truly finding a soulmate. Diner owner Luke Danes [Scott Patterson] is always there to lend his unwavering support and of course, Luke and Lorelai's chemistry is simply magical to watch, be it as good friends or as two people slowly being drawn towards each other.<br /><br />The rocky relations between Lorelai and her parents Emily and Richard Gilmore [ Kelly Bishop and Edward Hermann] goes through its usual turbulent times and its always entertaining to see Lorelai in action and putting her parents in their place, despite their overbearing attitude. Kelly Bishop's Emily is truly a delight to watch as she plays the snooty, controlling character to perfection.<br /><br />Amidst the changes in the main characters' lives this season, the most significant ones are the Rory-Jess-Dean love triangle, and for once we see Rory getting out of her goody-two-shoes character by going after Jess despite being Dean's girlfriend and the episode \\"They Shoot Gilmores Don't They\\" shows the resolution to this. There is also the college application anxiety, is it going to be Harvard or Yale?<br /><br />Lorelai's dreams of opening her own inn are developed in greater detail this season, as we see her working hard towards achieving that dream, especially with a certain event that acts as a catalyst towards that end.<br /><br />All in all, I rank this as my favorite GG season, but all the seasons are winners of course. A must-watch series!, I rank this as my favorite GG season, but all the seasons are winners of course. A must-watch series!
067144901X|5.0|This is THE all time favorite book for both of my toddler girls.  They both have continuously gone back to this book, and never seem to be sick of reviewing the noises that the animals in this book make especially those silly pigs!  A short book, you will soon have it memorized and can reiterate the words at a moment's notice.  Highly recommend!
6305428522|5.0|Considering the quality of this film, one would think that it should have won more awards,more acclaim. One factor might have been  that anyone under the age of 46 in 1994 would have had little or no recollection of the television scandals which \\"broke\\" in 1959. Secondly, since there were no laws pertaining to television ethics, nobody went to jail. Indeed,years later, the \\"Bobsey Twins\\"- Jack Barry and Dan Enright were right back at it again making  handsome sums on \\"The Joker's Wild\\". Additionally, let's not forget that \\"21\\" was only the tip of the iceberg.Quickly, \\"The $64,000 Question\\", \\"Tic-Tac-Dough\\"(another Enright,N.B.C. debacle), and \\"Dotto\\" soon came crashing down, one upon another. Finally, Bob Kittner's remark of television being a great educational tool could easily have become reality had there been a market for it. Instead, by 1961 F.C.C. chairman Newton Minnow was already labeling television \\"a vast wasteland\\", and by the late 60's we had Richard Nixon pulling the plug on Federal funding for P.B.S.due to alleged \\"liberal broadcasting\\". Sound familiar? Given yet another chance to become an educated society with the advent of the computer, instead we see S.A.T. scores again trending lower, perhaps in part due to computer games, pornography, lack of adult supervision,injurious adult supervision,and just plain stupidity. Never mind the excellence of \\"Quiz Show\\", nor the uniformly solid performances of a producer and actors of whom we expect the best. Be advised instead to salvage what we have left outside of the movies.
B000065BPB|5.0|Ok, to start, I'm not an audiophile so I wasn't particularly concerned with the ability to reproduce inaudible instruments in classical music tracks (I don't really listed to classical music either). What I did want was a great pair of headphones that was     a) comfortable to wear  b) sounded great (but not perfect)  c) had a long tangle-free cord  d) reduce the amount of ambient noise to prevent distractions  e) not leak sound back out to prevent distracting coworkers at loud volumes    If you're looking for the above, look no further. I think the combination of quality (also all parts are individually replaceable to extend the lifespan of this product) and price are unbeatable.
0307275639|5.0|I experienced Tuesdays with Morrie as an audiobook while taking a weekend jaunt to a lake cabin. The contrasts were apt -- wooded hills, still water, and Mitch Albom's voice on an iPod telling the poignant story of his down-to-earth mentor. I, too, have had the privilege of such a mentor, Sally Pierone, who dispenses wisdom with humor and passion, like Morrie. (Fortunately, Sal's going strong at 86. See [...]) Many thanks to Mitch for helping deliver us from the seductions of materialism.
B000BB1MIC|5.0|Season Five starts off with a bang, and just keeps getting better with every episode. At the end of Season Four, Rory [Alexis Bledel] sleeps with her married ex-boyfriend Dean [Jared Padalecki] and the beginning of Season Five sees Rory being 'sent' off on a European tour with her grandma Emily [Kelly Bishop], a ruse by Lorelai [Lauren Graham] hoping that things will cool between Rory and Dean.<br /><br />The plot twists in this season are fascinating - Rory eventually finds herself drifting apart from Dean, and drawn towards rich kid, Logan Huntzbeger [Matt Czuchry] which delight the senior Gilmores but not Lorelai. Luke and Lorelai's relationship grows from strength to strength, with some major hiccups in between, no thanks to the interference of Emily Gilmore [Kelly Bishop] and Christopher.<br /><br />The last two episodes of this season truly keeps you riveted as a dejected Rory turns to a desperate act that lands her not only in trouble with the law but also causes a rift between her and her mother, Lorelai.<br /><br />The writing is as good as ever and the acting superb. This is a great season that is sure to delight fans and new viewers alike.
141694737X|5.0|This is a wonderful lift the flap book for any young child.  It's especially appropriate for children with autism or other learning disabilities.  Each page contains only 1 flap hiding only 1 animal.  The backgrounds are simple white.  Some of the other flap books have way too much going on in the background or too many flaps on one page, making it difficult for some kids to focus on the activity.  My son, who has autism and is 4 years old, still loves this book even though he knows who's hiding behind the flap.  We used it to teach him animal noises, and now we use it to encourage him to answer yes/no questions.  I can't recommend it enough for a special needs child.
B000PKG7I4|5.0|I got Frank when it first came out.  Before the \\"Rehab\\" craze, I became a heavy duty Amy Winehouse fan because of her Frank CD. Frank is soulful, jazzy, and the lyrics are \\"off the chain\\".  Frank is refreshing and different then the usual cookie-cutter songs that are out there now.  Watching her on YouTube singing these songs makes me pray that she gets back to her old self.  She looked so amazing. Amy is an amazing talent and I can only hope that she comes out with an even better CD.
B0000CFW87|4.0|Another definite must-have. Again, this is not a CD with only 1 or 2 good songs - there are several songs in this album that rate as beautiful/great -- melody, lyrics, and voice. You will not be disappointed with Closer. It is a great follow-up to his debut album.
B00003CXC7|5.0|An excellent movie.  A true classic.  Very suspenseful.  It's great to be able to watch these old movies. Grace Kelly was an amazing actress as well as the rest of the cast.  A must see.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|My husband and I just recently discovered this show and absolutely loves every single one of them.  Great casting, great script, great everything!  Just when we thought they don't make shows like this anymore.  Thank You AMC!  We'll be even more thankful if you release the DVD soon.
B000003BZ4|5.0|A buddy of mine recommended these guys to me during our current tour in Afghanistan. I was looking for some new types of music to enjoy, as I have been exploring PHISH, and TREY ANASTASIO. He told me to try GOV'T MULE for jam bands. I ordered online through Amazon without hearing a note of this band. I received it last week and have not been able to listen to anything else. I absolutely love this CD.    The music is straight forward rock/blues. No BS. My buddy's recommendation was on target. This CD is worth your $$. Go for it!
B000I5X81K|3.0|I couldn't get into most of the songs on this album. I mean, I can appreciate the songs but I would rank them as just OK or nice. This album did not provide the same impact as his first two CDs. His voice is great but the songs just don't have that perfect blending of lyrics and melody.
0765316889|5.0|I really wish there were more fatasies like this out there. It is original - exciting - the characters feel real - It has depth and scope. I do agree that it was slower reading through the first half of the book (it felt like we were under seige forever) but Sanderson always put some little twist in the plot to keep you moving. I can't wait for book three.
B000002696|3.0|Now, before I get flamed to death, I want to say this: I consider myself a pretty big Miles Davis fan. I have heard somewhere around 45 of his recordings, including every studio album released in his life time but Star People, and five live discs. And this includes obscurities like Amandala (Which is, admittedly, pretty bad) and Dig (which is actually quite good). I even consider the oft-slagged Big Fun one of Miles' best albums. And it's not that I don't enjoy his electric work - quite to the contrary, In a Silent Way is debatably my favorite Miles Davis album, and I've heard plenty.<br />But with all that said, I just don't \\"get\\" this one. Or, should I say, I don't get about half of it. One of the things that made Silent Way work so well was the communication between the octet (Miles Davis plus Wayne Shorter on sax; John McLaughlin on guitar; Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea and Joe Zawinul on keyboards; Dave Holland on bass; and Tony Williams on drums). But the small army on this record does not communicate well, since there are just so MANY of them, it gets overwhelming. And the absence of Hancock (whose solo work often borders on genius, I'll add - or, as on Headhunters, The Prisoner, and Empyrean Isles, crosses that line) and Williams (my favorite drummer ever) does not help its case. Secondly, and more importantly, a couple of these songs bore me. \\"Pharaoh's Dance\\", by Zawinul, is just awful, spending twenty minutes trying and failing to touch on a decent groove. Out of those twenty minutes, not one is enjoyable. It just meanders on and on, a bunch of spacey, proto-ambient junk. And I never got the draw of ambient music. The record's other loser is \\"Sanctuary\\". Wayne Shorter penned it, and while I have nothing against him (in fact I love several of his tunes written for Miles' \\"second great quintet\\", most notably \\"Footprints\\" and \\"Nefertiti\\"), this draws an eleven-minute blank. I guess it's kinda soothing, but it's just background music. Nothing engaging about it whatsoever. The damn thing just drifts along aimlessly in a way that nothing from Silent Way ever did (though it does have a similar sound, I'll grant it that). No me gusta. No me gusta the first and last six minutes of \\"Spanish Key\\", either. The first six are funky but dull vamping. Then, after those six end, things really get going. Shorter steals the show with a haunting soprano sax solo (See? Told you I had nothing against him), and Miles and McLaughlin keep the train running for awhile. Then it dissolves into what can best be described as \\"virtuoso noodling\\".<br />Now, before I get dragged to pillory, let's get to the goods. You wanna know what the best song is here? And not just the best, but arguably the pinnacle of the electric period? (though \\"It's About That Time\\" and \\"What I Say\\" give it a run for its money, I'll admit). I'll tell you what it is: This album's title track. I'd call myself blown away by a lot of things: the build-up; the haunting, echoing, vibrato-laden trumpet theme; the numerous solos; the menacing yet fascinating nature of the piece in general. In my opinion, it's one of the greatest works of art of our time. Never mind that it's a half-hour long. That half-hour will fly by. I assure you. Another great classic all-powerful song is \\"Miles Runs the Voodoo Down\\", which again leaves me in absolute awe, for several reasons. The voodoo groove; McLaughlin's guitar; Miles' trumpet; the bass part (I won't even hazard a guess at who played it). My third favorite is \\"John McLaughlin\\", a showcase for G. Gordon Liddy. Wait, wait, hold on, I got my cue cards mixed up... John McLaughlin. Not crazy masochist Nixon (\\"I AM NOT A CROOK!\\") stooge. It's supposed to be the third part of the title track, which began as a five-part suite, though only three were used: two for the song itself, one for \\"McLaughlin\\". It's also the shortest song on the album, a mere 4:26.<br />So, right, that's all I got to say. Great musicianship all around (it IS  a Miles Davis record, after all), and some really good tunes - title track; \\"Miles Runs the Voodoo Down\\"; \\"John McLaughlin\\"; a third of \\"Spanish Key\\". Hey, if you were to take those four, you'd have a standard-length single album that was arguably Miles' best ever! Now that would've been impressive. For now, though, B*tches Brew leaves me cold. There are a ton of Miles discs that are better than this one, I think. But hey, that's just me. I'm weird.er all), and some really good tunes - title track; \\"Miles Runs the Voodoo Down\\"; \\"John McLaughlin\\"; a third of \\"Spanish Key\\".

0395389496|5.0|There is a magical spirit about this book.  Every year I buy three or four copies to give to the young people on my Christmas lists.  (I've found giving clothes to children who have their own definite ideas about fashion can be a dicey propostion.)  And I have to confess that when I want to feel the magic of Christmas, I open up Polar Express.  It is a great gift book!<br /><br />Also recommeded: [[ASIN:0757300537 Christmas Gifts, Christmas Voices]]--a great gift book for adults.
B000VR824S|3.0|You expect some serious guitar playing on the crossroads lineup, Most of Artists were fantastic especially Jeff Beck and Derck Trucks, but adding Sheryl Crow sing alongs really sucked. Not as good as the First Crossroads DVd.
B00005JPLW|4.0|I loved this movie. Perhaps the story wasn't as good as say Gladiator, but I just loved the dialogue in this movie. The quips just had you cheering or laughing in the aisle. \\"Our arrows will block out the sun!\\" \\"So we'll fight in the shade.\\" \\"THIS IS SPARTA!!\\" Oh my goodness, it was just an awesome movie! I dinged this movie 1 star for the stupid oracle seen (pointless, icky, and just plain gratuitous T&A).
B0000009SI|4.0|Frank's first gold, and if you ask me it deserved that distinction. The first side is a mock concept album about an Eskimo and his adventures concerning huskies with overactive bladders; fur trappers bludgeoning baby seals with snowshoes; St. Alphonzo; and gay priests having sex with leprechauns. Needless to say, it's not one of Frank's more mature efforts, but some of it can be funny (the infamous doo-wap send-up \\"Don't Eat the Yellow Snow\\"; \\"Nanook Rubs It\\"), and even when humor fails him (\\"Father O'Blivion\\"), the band is so solid, and the melodies are so catchy, you won't notice or care. That, and it's amusing to play \\"spot-the-references-to-previous-Zappa-albums!\\". The second side is considerably more artistic, featuring a heavy fusion instrumental (title track) with an exquisite guitar part and amazing heavy drums by Jim Gordon (Jack Bruce also plays bass, though he's buried beneath Frank and Tony), what may just be his best song ever: \\"Cosmik Debris\\", which combines sharp, hilarious, anti-\\"mysticism\\" lyrics; an excellent R&B melody (with surprising tempo shifts in the chorus), characteristically wonderful guitars, and a couple nods to Over-Nite Sensation; and the funny mock-blues \\"Stink-Foot\\", with searing guitars. Weak points? A couple. Homophobia comes back to haunt Frank on \\"Father O'Blivion\\" (but again that's a well-written song from a melodic standpoint), and as far as I'm concerned the rocker \\"Uncle Remus\\" and the fusion experiment \\"Excentrifugal Forz\\" have nothing going for either of them. At least they're both short. This isn't as socially relevant as Freak Out! or virtuoso like Hot Rats. To its credit, though, the humor is amusing 80% of the time, the songwriting is strong 95%, and the band is really solid. Zappa fans should not go without it.
B00008GKEG|5.0|What more do I need to say?  If you are a Beatles fan and haven't clicked the \\"Buy\\" button, Shame on you! lol    Seriously, It's a great set and a perfect addition to any collection.
0345347951|4.0|There are literally hundreds of sci-fi books that pose a possible future for humanity and, while I haven't read all of them (nor do I plan to do so), this is bound to be one of the best.  Clarke, who admittedly isn't one of my favorite sci-fi authors, is in his prime here.  This is a very strong story that keeps your attention from cover to cover.  The characters are good, but not great--the focus here is on the imaginative future that Clarke paints.  Not only is the story entertaining, it also has some insightful commentary on the human drive to create and progress.  I recommend this book highly whether you are a Clarke fan or not.
B000VI70WM|5.0|I must agree with the editorial review made by Tammy La Gorce (Amazon).  This album is very good. I was skeptical when I read online that Timbaland and Timberlake were both writing and singing on the album. I must say, Timbaland actually did a great job producing the deep bass and various linear notes for each song. Duran Duran uses Timbaland just a little in the backround. This actually enhances the bands modern new wave sound. I like the keyboards. As always, Nick Rhodes is innovative and very original. My man Simon le Bonn sounds great. John Taylor is used much more on Red Carpet Masacre than he was on Astronaut, which was a shame because he is a melodic bassist. I remember thinking to myself, wow, I can barely hear any bass on the Astronaut album.  Don't get me wrong, Astronaut was very good. But Red Carpet Masacre has a very unique style due to the heavier bass that Timbaland mixes in his production with Lebon's music.   Also, John Taylor is in charge of the art direction while Nick Rhodes is in charge of the photography of the outside and inside cover. Rhodes always manages to create a \\"gothic\\" feel with his photography of beautiful women in abstract photos. I believe abstract photography is an artform (that is well done) for Nick Rhodes.  Roger taylor sounds intense with drums. The entire band are even better today than 20 years ago! The music is great, the band looks good, and the art work for the album is very good.   As with any project that Simon le Bonn participates in, I rate this a 5 star album!  Tammy La Gorce mentioned this album has a \\"midnight moodiness\\" and she is correct. Duran Duran began their career as a New Romantic band with exotic videos to compliment their amazing songs.  Don't let other negative reviews fool you. This album is good because it is original and does not attempt to sound like their previous albums. Many bands get too caught up in one sound. So, all of their albums sound similiar to each other. Fear not, Red Carpet Masacre isa very original sounding album that was worth the wait!! This will be another classic for Duran Duran!!

B000002UUX|5.0|Total monster , it's great how the rhythem guitar is so intense ,  Kind of the way Jazz guys admire Harris of IM . You can't deny what lurks in the brain of the mighnty Mustaine    This CD upped the ante of what metal is .Much the way Ozzy and Rhoades did .The Sound is State of the art The crunch guitars and Bass stay out of each others frequency ranges , the drum parts are as intense as the guitar riffs .The songs are well crafted . The lead guitar has an interesting tension .It's alot of fun .     It should be intersting to see where mustaine goes now after 2 albums  ripping the U.S. government a 3ed A-hole , mabey he will get more into other topics like Maiden does ,Lore, myths , urban myths , scary movies, classic novels , how bout Phantasm portholes , or a concept album about a different planet where everything is cool and energy is created by generators that recharge thier own batteries so everything is cheaper!

0316779237|5.0|At 134 pages, Holidays on Ice is one of the shortest books I have read. But it has taken me about 4 months to finish it. No, it isn't that the book was boring, it was just that, well, at 134 pages, I found that I could put this book down and attack other, longer, books.    Contents:  SantaLand Diaries  Season's Greetings to Our Friends and Family!!  Dinah, the Christmas Whore  Front Row Center with Thaddeus Bristol  Based Upon a True Story  Christmas Means Giving    \\"SantaLand Diaries\\" is worth the price of admission. This is David's diary of working as an Elf at Macy's SantaLand. Great inside look at working during the holidays at New York's Macy store. The other story that is a work of nonfiction is \\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore,\\" where David talks about his sister's rescue of a woman during the holiday season. Extremely funny interaction at the Sedaris house, and David learns something about his family.    \\"Season's Greetings\\" is a very funny look at the tradition of sending out a letter to family friends recapping the year. A rather dysfunctional family, to be honest, and the ending has a nice twist. If you ever send out those letters, this letter is not one that you usually write. And that is what made it funny (and at times, laugh out loud funny). \\"Christmas Means Giving\\" gives a whole new meaning to the phrase. One-upmanship like you have never seen.    If you have kids, and you have attended the \\"Holiday Pageant,\\" \\"Front Row...\\" is a nasty review of the children's pageant. But I guess that is what made this story so amusing - you may think it, but you would never say it. David lays it all out for you. Finally, \\"Based Upon a True Story,\\" takes the whole reality TV/Made for TV genre to a new, lower, level. After reading those two stories, you realize that David can be dark and twisted.    I think that David is best when he writes about himself or his family. \\"SantaLand Diaries\\" and \\"Dinah\\" are the two best stories in the book, as he relates his own experiences for you. Reading this book during the Christmas season will bring a smile to your face and allow you to see the holidays in a whole new light.
0440238609|1.0|I don't really know why I'm wasting the time it takes to write a review.  I've already wasted enough time READING this drivel.  The books, (far too densely written for the target audience), actually begin with much promise and a host of very original fantasy ideas and settings.  Unfortunately, Mr. Pullman than quickly decends into an over-populated, over-complicated, over-preachy philosophical rant that continues through most of the second and ALL of the third book and which utterly consumes what little remains of a coherent plot.  I have nothing against the author's personal opinions, but they get in the way of what really could have been a great series.  His characters change personalities on a whim, act with no clear motivation, pursue nonsensical goals, and die meaningless deaths, only to arrive at a disappointing and anti-climatic ending that left me wishing I'd never picked up the first book.
1591841666|5.0|I am not into \\"self help\\" books, or the like. I don't think that I have ever read a book on being a better salesman or businessman (but I do have several on my bookshelf). So, why did I pick up The Dip? Because 1) I trust Seth, 2) I read his blog every day, and 3) at 70 pages, he doesn't have time for \\"fluff.\\"<br /><br />Contents:<br />Being the Best in the World is Seriously Underrated<br />If You're Not Going to Get to #1, You Might as Well Quit Now<br />The Best in the World?<br />Acknowledgements<br />It's Almost Impossible to Overinvest in Becoming the Market Leader<br /><br />A very quick read, but one that requires a second reading, so that you do not miss anything. Yes, you can miss some things. Seth throws a lot at you, and it takes some time to digest it. A second reading is almost required.<br /><br />So, what is The Dip? You start something and soon it gets hard and not a lot of fun. It may only be a setback that once you push through it, everything else falls into place. Can you recognize it? What can you do to overcome it? What have some other people done? These Dips, if you beat it properly, will propel you to be the best - in your market, your niche, your life. And, of course with that, comes the associated benefits; more recognition, wealth (and not just monetary), and security.<br /><br />This book is very well written (it has to be, since it is only 70 pages) and Seth provides enough information for you to succeed (or to recognize when to quit). There are quite a few good anecdotes in the book, but the one that I liked the best was when Seth was talking about Jack Welch (former CEO of GE) and why he sold off some profitable businesses. These businesses weren't the best in the world, they were more like #4. Why did they go? Because they showed the other people in the organization that \\". . . it was okay not to be the best in the world . . . \\" Probably an oversimplification, but I like the way that Seth thinks.<br /><br />I found it a very enjoyable and satisfying read and would recommend it highly.
B000W4HJ44|5.0|...watching this movie way too many times.<br /><br />I have always been a fan of John Waters films and the original version of Hairspray is one of my all-time faves.<br /><br />My friend, her daughter and I can quote the original line-byline whenever we watch it.<br /><br />I didn't like the stage version when it played in Los Angeles and wasn't planning to see the new film version.<br /><br />I was treated to it in July (I never pass up a free meal or a free movie).<br /><br />I love this version! I don't know exactly what they did to the score but this version is a lot better than the stage version and very true to the original film.<br /><br />I ended up dragging my friend and her daughter to see it because they thought it should never have been remade. They loved it, too.<br /><br />It's true that this is a re imagining of both the stage version and the original movie but it's loaded with wonderful homages to the first film that are obvious if you're really familiar with it.<br /><br />I think that's what made me fall in love with it. The makers of this film acknowledged the fans of the original above and beyond necessary.<br /><br />At the same time, the nods to the first film didn't stop the flow or distract, if you hadn't seen it.
0385340559|5.0|\\"You do not mess with the special investigators.\\"<br /><br />If you have read Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels (and this is the 11th in the series), you know that Jack Reacher was a member of an elite investigation unit in the Army. While previous novels have touched on this unit, this is the first time that Child has brought them all together, about ten years after they left the service.<br /><br />A former member of Reacher's old unit is found dead. Forensics show that the man was probably pushed out of a helicopter, from about 3,000 feet. Usually off the grid, Reacher uses his ATM card (he not only has an ATM card, but he also has a passport) to withdraw some cash for his next bus trip out of town. Interesting that he finds more cash in his account than he expected. The deposit is a coded message that there is trouble with the old unit. Thus begins Back Luck and Trouble, a reunion with the remaining members of Reacher's old squad - one of their own ends up dead (several are missing) and it is up to the others to sort out the clues and bring the people to justice. Special Investigator's version of justice. :-)<br /><br />This novel is not like the other Reacher books. The level of death and mayhem is not the same but the level of mystery is ratcheted up. Also, Child spends more time with the remaining members of Reacher's old squad, providing a lot of back story, fleshing out the characters more than in any of his previous novels. You discover that Reacher is something of a numbers man, he can see patterns in numbers, as if they are talking to him. Thus, the meaning behind the coded deposit in his account.  All of them are fiercely loyal to each other. Further, there is more mystery and old fashioned police work in this novel (the squad runs down leads, interview people, and revise their conclusions).<br /><br />It is hard to imagine that Child has 11 Reacher novels under his belt. One would think that after that many books, the character would be getting stale, predictable. With Bad Luck and Trouble, nothing could be further from the truth. While keeping a lot of what makes Reacher \\"Reacher,\\" he infuses the novel with his old Army buddies, changing the dynamic and adding more to the characters. A very satisfying novel with an excellent ending. The end notes tell you that he is already at work on Reacher #12, and I cannot wait.uble, nothing could be further from the truth.

B000WCDI5K|5.0|The Killer's Sawdust contains b-sides and rarities, and one new track called Tranquilize featuring Lou Reed. To my delight, Sawdust is an enjoyable album, the unreleased tracks have great melodies and interesting lyrics. Some of the tracks I have heard before like The Ballad of Michael Valentine, Glamorous Indie Rock & Roll, and Under the Gun from the Hot Fuss Special Edition LP. Some of my favorite songs from Sawdust include: Sweet Talk, All The Pretty Faces, Move Away, Who Let You Go?, Romeo & Juliet, Leave the Bourbon on the Shelf, Daddy's Eyes, Where the White Boys Dance, and Sam's Town (Abbey Road Version). Hard to believe some of these songs didn't make it on their last two studio albums, The Killers continue to churn out pop/rock masterpieces. Get Sawdust today!
0440241030|5.0|The book that I had been saving for vacation was The Hard Way by Lee Child. There is nothing like having a Reacher novel while sitting on the beach.     Reacher is in New York, enjoying an espresso in a coffee house, when he notices a man walk up to a car, open it, and drive away. There was just something about the man that made Reacher notice (and as an ex-MP, Reacher is very good at noticing things). A day later, while Reacher is sitting in the same cafe, a very military-type person comes in asking questions of the wait staff. Reacher is pointed out as someone that was in the cafe the prior evening. Thus, begins the latest Reacher novel. What follows is probably the best Reacher novel from Lee Child. Reacher finds himself helping a mercenary, Edward Lane, and his ex-Special Forces employees find Edward's kidnapped wife and daughter. Unlike other times he has helped people, this time Edward is going to pay Reacher a lot of money for his assistance.     This book moves fast, all over New York City and the English countryside. I really enjoyed some of the small details, such as Reacher's problems with technology that we take for granted. It was also fun reading about Reacher interacting with the mercenaries. They all think that they can take him, but Reacher is not to be underestimated.     A highly recommended novel from Lee Child.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|First, I RARELY give 5 stars, but I think this season earned it.  Just about every episode was great with very little \\"filling episode\\" junk.  I watched the whole season in a month (sometimes 2 in a night) and could not get enough.      The DVD quality is also quite impressive, almost looked HD.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|What a fantastic CD. This music is what makes Bruce and the E   Street so great. A recommended CD for all.
B000FP2OPY|3.0|This has some great episodes but the hunt for the demon and Dad got a little old for me (kind of like Mulder's sister!).  I had a hard time finishing the season when only watching once a week, and almost did not watch season 2.  I am glad I did though, watched season 2 in a month and wanted more!
0007260466|5.0|my son (age 2.85) loved this book.  we laughed at the pictures of the boy taking his star out for a walk. and reading a story to his star at the end. top marks for this clever book. and also \\"the way back home\\" by the same author is one of my son's faves also.
6305263248|5.0|And that statement is a stretch. Here is another movie that I had on VHS that just needed Dolby Digital and cleanDVD reproduction.

B00006FDCJ|5.0|There's not much to say. Great movie. I had it on VHS. I needed a clean version for my DVD collection. It a class of it's own.
B000TGJ8CQ|4.0|It's a cool plot - a man with a 2-minute window of clairvoyance. The movie is very enjoyable, although at the end you are left with the feeling that it could have used a bit more \\"wrap up\\". But, OK, different can be good and maybe leaving one thing open-ended makes it that much more memorable. I think demanding that everything be brought to a nice, neat close is too stereotypical.    I am also wondering why the international terrorists in Hollywood movies (e.g., this one and \\"The Sum of All Fears\\") these days are always clean-cut Europeans - usually Brits (I think \\"True Lies\\" is the only exception I've seen). They're cast as educated, sophisticated, professional, completely non-emotional and strangely lacking motive for committing such heinous crimes. I am left to presume that producers are afraid of offending someone and so go with the group least likely to be bothered by such a portrayal. The terrorists aren't developed in the movie - they're just there as cannon fodder, replete with lots of henchmen just as in the \\"Die Hard\\" series, so that the heroes have plenty of first-person shooter scenes. Although lacking in some aspects, it is a movie worth seeing.

0446577391|2.0|I've read all 12 of David Baldacci's novels, starting with \\"Absolute Power\\" (1996). Unfortunately, after my disappointment with \\"Stone Cold\\", the third novel in the Camel Club series, I'll be taking his name off of my `must read' authors list. It looks like Baldacci has become another author who just writes to fill up pages until the magic number (usually around 400) is reached.    To fill the pages, Baldacci includes a few sub-plots. The first involves casino owner Jerry Badger trying to kill Annabelle Conroy in revenge for her conning him out of millions of dollars in the previous Camel Club book \\"The Collectors\\". Although all series novels reuse characters, there should be a warning label on the cover of books that continue the plot from the previous book. For this book: \\"Warning - If you really want to understand what's happening, you should read \\"The Collectors\\" before reading this book.\\"    In the second sub-plot, Baldacci shows how easy it is for terrorists to circumvent security in airplanes, buildings, etc. I'm not sure why this is included. Either Baldacci wants to make a point that we need better security or he wants to show that terrorists can always take advantage of weaknesses. Or maybe he just needed to fill up some more pages.     The main plot involves Harry Finn, the son of an assassinated CIA agent, who assassinates a former Chief of Intelligence and is trying to assassinate a Senator (who's also an ex-CIA agent). However, the former Chief of Intelligence (who's also an ex-CIA agent) survives the assassination attempt (but is presumed dead). The main character is Oliver Stone (who was also unsuccessfully assassinated when he was a CIA agent and is also presumed dead). There are also many current-CIA agents who are unsuccessfully trying to kill Harry and Oliver, but who end of being killed themselves. Baldacci explains a few times that when this happens, the bodies of the CIA agents are secretly transported overseas and their death is reported as aresult of an automobile accident. Does any of this make sense?     I'm willing to bet that if anyone else submitted this manuscript to a publisher, it would probably be rejected. But I guess that the name Baldacci sells books, no matter how poorly they are written.

B00006CXSS|5.0|Though it aired several years ago on HBO and has now become a very familiar genre, this true World War II epic story is absolutely fresh.  Having read the Biography of Major Winters, the man who lead the Band of Brothers, I know that almost every detail of this series factual.  Most every conversation and shot fired was replicated from his personal memoirs and those of his comrades.  This is a must see for every American.
B000WQW988|5.0|This is absolutely the best music DVD I've ever seen.  Picture quality is great, and (obviously) more importantly, the sound is incredible.  I've played this on my laptop, and in my DVD player at home with 5.1 surround, and it sounds great in both places.  MTV did a fantastic job putting this together.  Not only do you get the MTV broadcast, but you also get the entire show, without editing, from song to song, and it's really cool to see how Kurt was interacting with the crowd, Krist and Dave, and the guest musicians he had on the show.    The MTV News \\"Bare Witness\\" segment was really neat too.  You see people involved with the concert, whether it be fans or the MTV producers behind the scenes, and they lend some really valuable insight into that very special evening in NYC.    I think even if you are not a Nirvana fan or a Kurt Cobain fan (how can you not be a fan, though?), this DVD is a great purchase.  For $12, you cannot find a better value for what you get in terms of quality.  Also, this was the most historic concert of the 90's, as just a few months later, Cobain's life was ended.  This intimate look into that special night that so few shared with the band is really worthwhile.

0142000671|5.0|Despite the length of this novel, it contains a powerful plot that will leave any reader heart-broken. The author describes the settings in such detail you can almost smell the alfalfa. As far as the plot goes, he leaves room for your imagination to fill in the blanks and gives the plot life through drama and issues that any worker would face during the early 1900s. Of mice and men, it is a must-read for any reading level.   The setting is based in the early 1900s, where Lennie and George, the two main characters, work for a new employer on a swamp. The author creates great detail not only through words, but also through the actions of other characters. For example, the author never once mentions Lennie's mental disability. Instead, he uses actions and dialogue to show that he is. John Steinbeck is a magnificent author, and he has my regards.

031286504X|5.0|Let me just say first that i saw the movie trailer for I am Legend before i read the book because i loved the idea so much. But now that i have read the book i think that the movie i goin to be a let down. I have always loved VAMPIRES and i have always loved the idea of someone being the LAST PERSON ON EARTH but i never thought that somebody had wrought a book with both these things in it. THANK YOU RICHARD MATHESON.<br />The book starts off with Robert Neville the only man that had survived the vampire attack. He now lives in a world were no other human is alive (except for the vampires). Doing the day Neville does the usual work to his house fixing the generator; replacing boards that have broken off; hanging up garlic; and going to the ruin civilization for supplies. But at night he bolts the door shut and prays for the dawn to come. That is the one thing i loved so much about this book is that in the day he could do anything he wanted (which included  killing of the vampire in there coma like sleep during the day) but at night he has to stay barricaded in his house waiting till the sun up.<br />I never felt for a character as much as i fell for Robert Neville and Richard Matheson makes you fell like you are there with Neville and going through every emotion that he is going through.<br />All and all I am Legend is the best book i have ever read and i doubt that any other book will beat it.<br />I totally think that if you love vampires or have any good taste what so ever you should definitely like this book and think me for writing such a awesome review.<br />LONG LIVE ROBERT NEVILLE<br />Thank you.

I purchased the HD DVD version about three weeks ago and I am very pleased with the image quality using a LG 1080p HD set and a Toshiba HD DVD player also at 1080p. The sharpness and color of the images are amazing. Worth the upgrade for this old classic movie with Redford and Newman.

0307276902|4.0|Honestly I had no desire to read this book after all of the controversy surrounding it.  Not that I care if it's a true story or not, but it just seemed too hyped up.  So after all of the buzz died down, and I had run out of books, I decided to give it a shot.  What a fabulous memoir!  I really enjoyed this book and have only one complaint: the writing was very graphic about some not-so-pleasant events.  On more than one occasion I found myself wanting to shield my eyes like you do during a horror film.
B00000JGHM|5.0|Pacino and De Niro were perfectly cast for this movie. Jon Voight is the guy who gives De Niro and his crew \\"the scores.\\" Pacino is the cop who tries to nail De Niro's kind before they can \\"take down scores.\\"  Great acting, great plot. Bad Guys vs. Good Guys. Bad Guys vs Bad Guys......<br /><br />The bank robbery shootout was a masterpiece. For once a movie portrayed the \\"professional bad guys\\" as actually knowing how to shoot.  And boy, do they hand the cops their BEE-HINDS in their hats. They basically kicked cop-butt. Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore join De Niro with their assault rifles in the mayhem they lay out on the streets of L.A. This is the kind of movie that's get cops wailing and whining that they're out-gunned in the streets, when in reality, all you gotta' do is to practice shooting your weapon, and lay off the freakin' donuts.<br /><br />William Fitchner plays a double-crossing bad guy who gets his just desserts toward the end of the movie. The scene where his men try and double-cross DeNiro's crew in the abandoned drive-in was just another example of the difference between the pro's and the amateurs.<br /><br />The dialogue between Pacino and De Niro in the restaurant should have been an \\"Oscar\\" winner.
B00007G207|5.0|I first became acquainted with the movie CINEMA PARADISO, was after listening to Cinema Paradiso, recorded by Josh Groban on his first album  Out of curiosity, I went investigating on the web, checked out a few sites and bought the original and the new version.....Iloved the original and listened without subtitles........but the \\"new version\\" especially the added scenes, were so full of passion and feeling, that tears rolled down my face....I am not a movie critic, but this is THE GREATEST foreign film I have ever watched.......My favorite, used to be A MAN AND A WOMAN (FRENCH).........BUT Cinema Paradiso surpasses them all; watch it with someone you love
B000J4QWMC|2.0|Uh boy...I think Jamie Foxx (Rico) tried a little too hard in trying to portray the undercover heavy, by mumbling, mumbling, mumbling. Really annoying. The storyline of Gong Li (Isabella-the bad guys/girls businesswoman) with whom Colin Farrell (Sonny) got romantically involved, was really corny. The bad guys who supposedly had eyes on everything and everybody, never seemed to have their eyes on the undercover cops when they met their superiors.<br /><br />The climactic gun battle, which you'd expect from a movie like this, is really bogus. The idiotic Vice captain who was fumbling around like an amateur, trying to spot the bad-guy snipers with his night scope should have delegated that duty to HIS snipers (or counter-snipers); who ended up taking out the two bad snipes seconds before the big gun battle. As the gun battle ensued, the Vice cops were doing the majority of the shooting with the bad guys; when the S.W.A.T. assault team should've been there within a few seconds. When S.W.A.T. did show up, the battle was nearly over. And you kind of wonder what the heck happened to the snipers who should've been picking off the bad guys; who were continually exposing themselves to easy shots. But then again, you wouldn't have your exciting, long drawn-out, extended sequence \\"shootout\\" to thrill the movie-goers.<br /><br />The shootout scene in the trailer was better than the big shootout. Even though the dialogue between the rifle-wielding cop and bad guy was ridiculously laughable. Yeah-Yeah. It's only a movie.
0143038419|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It was a delicious read that takes you to depths within yourself from a spiritual perspective yet also delivers a travel log and a fun entertaining read. The writing is a beautiful thing and the story line is offered with grace, elegance and remarkable insights. In the world of the Law of Attraction, The Secret and other self help types of offings, this one surpasses them all with delightful prose and true illustrations of a life fully lived with all its wonders and challenges. I thank Elizabeth for letting us be a fly on the wall of her unique year long journey into her soul, that in turn allowed me a deeper understanding of my own.

B000TUXL2A|5.0|Je commencerai par faire quelques remarques d'ordre général, pour ensuite essayer d'être plus spécifique à propos de chaque titre qui compose cet album.    Je vous renvoie à l'article précédent concernant les différentes versions disponibles et les infos sur les musiciens de l'album, ou encore les crédits concernant la pochette de ce dernier.    KILL TO GET CRIMSON, est avant tout un album de mark knopfler, le songwriter! Nous avons beaucoup entendu le refrain selon lequel Dire Straits était mark knopfler, et que mark knopfler en solo, c'était Dire Straits sans dIRE sTRAITS et sans le tapage tout autour.  Question tapage publicitaire, ça y est c'est négocié, mark knopfler est parvenu à ses fins. Fini les longues promos, séances d'interviews interminables, couvertures de magazines, et fini le sticker \\"la voix et la guitare de Dire Straits\\" sur l'album!  Vous l'aurez compris mark knopfler \\"vend\\" aujourd'hui sur ses acquis et ne part plus en prospection, d'ailleurs cela faisait déjà un bon bout de temps qu'il y avait renoncé, au grand désespoir des maisons de disques, mais aussi de son ex-manager Ed Bicknell (manager de Dire Straits) avec qui la rupture fut sévèrement consommée en 2000 à la sortie du 2ème album solo \\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\".    Et si cet amalgame entre Dire Straits et mark knopfler est inévitable, pour la simple et bonne raison que tous les titres sont issus de la même tête et joués par les mêmes doigts, il n'en reste pas moins que notre homme cherche de plus en plus à couper le cordon qui le relie encore un peu à son ancien groupe génial.    Après de nombreuses écoutes (ce travail d'écoute est très important avec les albums de mark knopfler pour en dégager l'essence profonde) une chose est \\"assez rapidement\\" évidente: cet album s'écoute d'un bout à l'autre dans un esprit d'homogénéÏté assez fort! Bien sûr cette homogénéïté s'acquiert avec les écoutes, tandis que la toute première laisse la part belle à certains titres.  Les solos à rallonge ont quasi disparu, la voix se fait plus chaude et plus douce aussi, et l'accent est une nouvelle fois mis sur les histoires.    TRUE LOVE WILL NEVER FADE:  Ce titre qui ouvre l'album a été choisi comme premier single en Europe. Au premier abord pourtant il n'a pas grand chose d'un single. Une mélodie et des arrangements assez évidents, un tempo très intermédiaire, et pas réellement de climax (moment fort).  Néanmoins ce morceau finit par vous séduire car la ligne mélodique reste agréable et efficace, dommage que le tout ne soit pas épicé et relevé d'un solo ou deux.    THE SCAFFOLDER'S WIFE:  Voici pour moi la perle du CD!     J'ai en effet un vrai coup de coeur pour THE SCAFFOLDER'S WIFE et sa flûte vraiment incroyable, qui me rappelle \\"The Fool On The Hill\\" des Beatles. Ma préférée de l'album sans problème pour la nouveauté qu'elle apporte!  Le texte raconte la vie et les habitudes d'une femme d'échaffaudeur ayant consacré sa vie aux comptes de l'entreprise familiale, tout en essayant de gravir l'échelle sociale et d'enfin pouvoir prendre un peu soin d'elle.  Un titre vraiment extraordinaire, mélodiquement irréprochable, et qui laisse par ci par là un peu de place également au toucher si distinctif de mark knopfler à la guitare.       THE FIZZY AND THE STILL:  Autre titre qui remporte mes faveurs!   C'est un morceau assez 60's, très influencé par la guitare de Hank Marvin, guitariste des Shadows (souvenez vous du célèbrissime \\"Apache\\"). Cette filiation est d'autant plus évidente que mark knopfler joue les parties de guitare au médiateur et non avec les doigts.  L'effet est bien entendu celui escomtpé, mais pourra frustrer les amateurs purs et durs du fingerpicking à la knopfler!  Le chant est ici encore en avant, avec des petits passages aigus assez sympathiques et originaux, qui portent à merveille la déception et le semi-échec d'un jeune homme ayant tenté l'aventure Hollywoodienne et ayant dû se résoudre à ce que cette vie n'était pas faite pour lui.    HEART FULL OF HOLES:  Rarement, je dois dire je n'ai vu un titre si long (6'30) passer si vite!  Ce morceau est une autre des réussites de cet opus. Les paroles, pas forcément évidentes à appréhender du fait de leur caractère littéraire et poétique, sont néanmoins tout à fait admirables.  Et atout majeur, la mélodie présente, selon moi, un véritable intérêt.   Dans l'ensemble pourtant la ligne mélodique principale est assez simple et répétitive, mais il se cache dans ce titre un passage instrumental sur fond d'accordéon vraiment sublime, n'ayons pas peur des mots, évoquant très fortement l'univers des fêtes foraines. Cela renvoie aussi à l'enfance de mark knopfler et à certains passages de sa bande originale pour le film Local Hero.   A déguster, un soir d'hiver, devant la cheminée, comme un bon vieux \\"Ragpicker's Dream\\"!    WE CAN GET WILD:  Autre morceau évoquant les années 60 et les Shadows de par son atmosphère, ses guitares très \\"twangy\\" et son orgue rétro. C'est un morceau qui devrait plaire aux fans de Dire Straits, bien que les solos soient encore absents et le médiateur omniprésent!  Un bon titre dans l'ensemble.      SECONDARY WALTZ:  L'histoire de ce titre est certainement importante à connaître avant de faire une analyse plus poussée!  Secondary Waltz, est un texte que mk avait écrit bien avant l'aventure Dire Straits, et pour lequel il n'avait jamais réellement trouvé de support musical lui convenant. En 1996, pour l'album Golden Heart, une demo avait bien été enregistrée, mais le résultat n'avait pas été concluant. Ce n'est donc que récemment que mark knopfler s'est penché plus sérieusement sur le cas de ce texte humoristique racontant la préparation d'une fête de Noël, où un ex-commando de l'armée reconverti en prof de danse enseignait de manière plutôt rustre comment danser la valse à des élèves de 12 ans complétement terrorisés!  Autant vous dire que les paroles sont d'un caucasse impitoyable, écrites par un knopfler d'une vingtaine d'années.  Je connaissais cet air depuis peu, mark knopfler l'ayant joué lors d'un festival littéraire quelques temps avant la sortie de l'album (voir article précédent sur KILL TO GET CRIMSON), et dans un premier temps cette version album m'a un peu déçu.  Je m'attendais à des arrangements plus folk et moins musette, mais je m'y suis fait petit à petit. C'est d'ailleurs une volonté mimétique évidente de la part de knopfler de créer une valse \\"folko-musette\\" pour véhiculer cette satire.    PUNISH THE MONKEY:  C'est le titre un peu plus up-tempo de l'album. Choisi comme par hasard par la Warner comme single sur le continent américain!  Autre satire, d'où se dégage le cynisme pourtant désormais contenu de mark knopfler. Mais cela doit-être plus fort que lui parfois, l'écorché vif refait surface d'une manière ou d'une autre et assène ses pics cinglants (cf. Don't Crash The Ambulance, album Shangri-la, 2004).  La mélodie est très agréable et possède cette fois-ci un vrai potentiel radio. Très proche de sa cousine germaine \\"Summer Of Love\\" paru en B-side du single Boom, Like That en 2004, et utilisant un plan d'accords pour le refrain et la coda (fin) très similaire à celui d'Expresso Love en 1980.       LET IT ALL GO:  L'esprit est très \\"scotish\\" et me rappelle la BO de \\"Sons Of Scotland\\" et plus précisément le titre \\"All That I Have In The World\\". Ce n'est ni plus ni moins qu'une balade écossaise de bonne facture, mettant en scène un peintre tentant de dissuader un jeune homme de devenir artiste et l'encourageant plutôt à s'engager dans la marine, l'air force, ou l'armée, comme tous les gens de son âge à cette époque.     BEHIND WITH THE RENT:  C'est l'intro de ce morceau qui m'a tout d'abord scotché. J'aurais aimé que cet esprit soit prolongé car l'ambiance tourne rapidement à quelque chose de plusBluesy, quoique très évocateur de l'écriture de david knopfler. Cependant cette ambiance colle tout de même très bien à l'ensemble avec ses sons de cuivres dispersés ça et là,. Et puis de tout façon le thème de l'introduction est réutilisé plus tard dans le refrain.   Un très bon titre!    THE FISH AND THE BIRD:  Ce morceau faisant la part belle à la métaphore a ses atouts et ses faiblesses. De prime abord, c'est le point faible de l'album. Trop lent peut-être. Presque un conte parlé plutôt qu'une chanson. Maintenant, avec plus de recul, il reste que les accords sont agréables et que le chant, quelque peu inspiré des chants médiévaux, apporte un plus à la palette vocale de mark knopfler.    MADAME GENEVA'S:  Une autre de mes favorites.  On y retrouve le doigté incroyable de mark knopfler capable d'arpèges fabulueuses!  Le texte est magnifique, la mélodie imparable, la partie d'orgue doublant les arpèges est tout bonnement somptueuse.  Une très bonne chanson dont les arpèges finaux évoquent encore david knopfler et le titre \\"Jericho\\" sur l'album \\"Wishbones\\", 2001.     IN THE SKY:  Voici un très bon choix pour clôturer l'album, et ce, pour deux raisons.  D'abord, parce que ce titre dure plus de 7 minutes et s'étend comme un générique de fin. Ensuite, parce qu'il sonne comme un cadeau aux fans un peu nostalgiques, ou comme un lot de consolation pour ceux qui n'auraient pas suivi le virage dépouillé et folk appuyé par ce dernier album. En effet, In The Sky nous régale des parties de saxophone de Chris White, ex-Dire Straits, rappelant les grandes heures de Romeo and Juliet (live), Your Latest Trick, et autres classiques du plus gros vendeur de disques des années 80.    Concernant l'ambiance générale, je dirais que In The Sky me fait penser à un titre du dernier album de Cabrel, avec les cuivres et le picking de mark knopfler pour toile de fond!     KILL TO GET CRIMSON est donc selon moi un bon album.  Maintenant, il y aura desenthousiastes et des déçus, car les albums solos de mark knopfler sont  plus difficilement appréhendables que le commun des albums et nous réservent des surprises, bonnes ou mauvaises, du fait de ses nouvelles explorations et de ses nouvelles approches. Ce qui est intéressant avec ce genre d'albums néanmoins, c'est qu'avec le temps vous pouvez finir par en tomber vraiment amoureux! Et mk est très bon pour cela. Il ne vous livre jamais vraiment des albums klinex que vous allez aimer instantanément puis jeter aussi vite, comme il est coutume de nos jours, où l'on mise sur des titres aux accords efficaces mais banals voire simplistes, calibrés sur 2'30, 3', format Hit radio! Au contraire, ses albums sont capables de passer l'épreuve du temps et de trouver un public à chaque génération!     Et puis il faut s'y faire, Mark Knopfler a évolué. Aujourd'hui il ne passe plus son temps libre à travailler des gammes et des accords, mais à improviser des berceuses pour endormir ses deux \\"adorables petites filles\\", selon ses propres dires. Il se dit, à son grand étonnement, capable de créer instantanément des dizaines de mélodies de cette façon, juste en gratouillant pour ses enfants.  Il ne faut donc peut-être pas aller chercher plus loin pour savoir d'où nous viennent les mélodies de certains titres issus de ses derniers albums comme All That Matters, Heart Full Of Holes, Old Pigweed, One More Matinée, The Ragpicker's Dream, ou encore Stand Up Guy...
B00005JPFH|5.0|A long, but poinent film, it shows how we are defined by the choices we make, and the resulting actions we take.  Through in some awesome special effects, great cast, and you've got a wonderful film for the whole family.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|I bought this dvd because I was curious about Eugene Hutz as an actor. For those of you not familiar with is band GOGOL BORDELLO, he is the charismatic (to put it mildly) frontman for a gypsy punk band that is one of the most exciting and unique live acts out there. I knew nothing of the story prior to purchasing the dvd.    Wow.    This is a road-trip film that is a journey of self-discovery. It offers everything: humor, sadness, confusion, more humor, beautiful scenery, conflict, and a poignant resolution.     The other reviews go deeper into the storyline of this film. I was glad that I knew almost nothing about this film prior to viewing.    If you want to view something totally fresh and unexpected, watch this film. It's not like anything else out there.

I decided that it was about time to wipe off the dust and pop in the movie and I am so glad that I did for I had forgotten how much I truly adore this movie.  I mean, I remember that I was impressed when I saw it initially not knowing what to expect really but I think that over time my taste now allows me to completely fall in love with this movie.  Taking the classic story of Cinderella and making it realistic was an endeavor in itself but Andy Tennant and his cast truly deliver brilliantly here.<br /><br />So, in this fresh undertaking we are introduced to Danielle De Barbarac, a young woman who finds herself in a dire situation.  Young Danielle's father has suddenly died and she is now at the mercy of the most merciless of women, her stepmother The Baroness Rodmilla De Ghent and her ghoulish daughter Marguerite (The Baroness' other daughter Jacqueline is actually a kindhearted soul).  The Baroness has turned her father's house into a house of fear and treachery and she is constantly butting heads with Danielle.  Their feud seems to reach its peek about the time that rebellious Prince Henry begins his search for a bride.  A misunderstanding causes the Prince to fall head over heals in love with Danielle and as they secretly court her `big secret' is in danger of being revealed.<br /><br />The direction is wonderful here, the cinematography is beautiful and the whole mood expressed in the film is just warm and delightful.  The actors all do a wonderful job in their respective roles, Drew Barrymore deliver such a well rounded and heart warming performance that I'm astounded at her Oscar snub (especially in a year where Gwyneth Paltrow was embraced for doing the same thing).  Anjelica Huston is the epitome of evil as The Baroness, you can tell she is just eating this up.  Patrick Godfrey is hilarious as Leonardo da Vinci and Megan Dodds and Melanie Lynskey both are astounding as the two polar opposite stepsisters.

B000MR9D5E|4.0|I bought the BBC version of this incredible film ~ and, I must say, I'll be buying the Discovery Channel version with Sigourney Weaver narrating VERY soon.  After seeing it on television, I was so enthralled that I couldn't wait to own it.  I hadn't heard Attenborough's voice in quite a few years, and I thought it would be fine, even though I LOVE Weaver's voice with this film.  No disrespect meant to the legendary David Attenborough, a demi-god among naturalists, but his voice is very difficult to listen to at this point, and I find that it's very distracting.  I often press the mute button ~ and I know a lot of other people who were equally disappointed when they bought the BBC version.  I'm certain that this is why Discovery aired this with a change of narrators.

B00005JN8Z|2.0|Too much of Quo Vadis is based on the fabricated apocryphal (not in the canonized bible) Acts of Paul, Acts of Peter, and the Acts of Peter and Paul. These writings contain several miracles and unbelievable stories about Peter and Paul. This is not the Acts of the Apostles from the bible. I'm referring to The Acts of Peter and Paul that never made it into the canonized version. They are filled with miraculous stories and events that never happened. They are stories. This fabricated literature is where Christians get the idea of Peter being crucified upside down, Paul being beheaded in Rome, and the awful exaggerated and fabricated stories of Nero. I'll save my views on the actual movie itself towards the end of my review, but first I would like to state how Quo Vadis is not based on truth.    The first of these apocryphal writings was the Acts of Paul written somewhere around 160 -180 CE. The discovery of a coptic version of the text demonstrated that the text was composed of the Acts of Paul and Thecla, the Epistle of the Corinthians to Paul, the Third Epistle to the Corinthians, and the Martyrdom of Paul - his death at the hand of Nero. Paul is depicted as a miracle worker, as he even is portrayed in Acts of the Apostles in the canonized bible. His miracles in the Acts of Paul include: raising the dead in Antioch and survived a stoning, praying to god to deliver Thecla and god does, bringing down half the temple of Apollo in Sidon with god's help, healing people with god's help, speaking to angles in tongues, taming a lion in an arena, and after being beheaded he appears to Nero and Nero stops persecuting Christians.    The Acts of Peter was originally composed in Greek also towards the end of the 2nd century CE. In this text Peter performs miracles such as flying over Rome with Simon Magus, making a baby talk, and making a dog talk too. The dog is said to hunt down the magician Simon Magus and prophecy to him. Peter even makes a smoked fish come back alive to swim again.     Shortly after the end of the second century CE, the Acts of Peter and Paul was written based on the Acts of Peter. This is where these ideas of Peter being crucified upside down, Paul being beheaded, and the terrible fabricated ideas were being passed on about Nero. The Acts of Peter and Paul concludes describing Peter's martyrdom as upside-down crucifixion and Paul's beheading at the hands of Nero. This is also where the statement Quo vadis? comes from. It is a Latin phrase meaning \\"Where are you going?\\" or \\"Whither goest thou?\\". Peter meets Jesus as Peter is fleeing from likely crucifixion in Rome. Peter asks Jesus the question; Jesus' answer, \\"I am going to Rome to be crucified again\\", and this prompts Peter to gain the courage to continue his ministry and eventually become a martyr.    Nero's persecution of the Christians is an invention of the Church. There is no other account of Nero persecuting Christians besides Christian writings and two interpolations into writings of the early historians Tacitus (56-117 CE) and Suetonius (71-135 CE). Tacitus and Suetonius wrote long before the Acts Of Peter and Paul showing that the very few lines interpolated into their works were done by Christians writing during the times after the Acts of Peter and Paul. Tacitus and Suetonius did indeed portray Nero in a negative fashion, as any historian would have done, but neither of these two writers EVER mention Chrisitans in ANY of their writings except for two very out of place interpolations. They do mention Jews at this time as a superstitious religion but they do not mention Christians. The Nero persecution stories start with the fabricated writings of the Acts of Peter and Paul written sometime between 160-190 CE.     Tertullian (160-220 CE) a christian writer, refers to the Acts of Paul several times in his writings. He takes his ideas of Nero persecuting the Christians straight from the fabricated Acts of Paul. This is what Tertullian refers to when he is mentioned in the Church History written by Eusebius:    \\"The Roman Tertullian is likewise a witness of this. He writes as follows: Examine your records. There you will find that Nero was the first that persecuted this doctrine\\". Church History Book 2 , chapter 25    The \\"records\\" that Tertullian is referring to is the fabricated Acts of Paul. Tertullian was VERY familiar with these fictitious writings but he considered them to be truthful, miracles and all. Eusebius (263-339 CE) another Christian writer considered a father of church history, refers to Tertullian several times. Eusebius took the Nero story even further and he is the one who most likely made the interpolations to the works of Tacitus and Suetonius. Sulpicius Severus (363-425 CE) was another Christian writer who refers to Eusebius and also furthers the fabricated stories about Nero persecuting the Christians.    In the movie, Quo Vadis, the biblical Paul is shown as repeatedly preaching about the physical historical Jesus. The epistles as attributed to Paul describe a very different type of Jesus than the gospels. In the Epistles, Paul's Jesus is only a spiritual channel to God as revealed only to Paul. The Jesus of the gospels is literally a miracle working man teaching others and living actually on earth. In Paul's Epistles, there is no mention of Jesus being born of a virgin in Bethlehem, living in Nazareth (which was not even in existence until the 2nd century CE), John the Baptist, a trial before Pilate, Judas, miracles or teachings like the sermon on the mount, outside the gates of Jerusalem as the place of crucifixion, or a lineage to David.     Marcion, was the first to present the epistles of Paul in the 120-140s CE which would have been about 100 years after their supposed writing date according to the New Testament. Marcion was the widely popular Gnostic heretic preacher who denounced the Old Testament God, saw Paul as the only apostle. The story of Paul is based in legend. By studying Marcionand his dual gods this becomes clear. There is little doubt that the teachings of Marcion and his followers represented a greater threat to Orthodox Christianity than any other heresy in the second century. Marcion's churches were widespread and competed heavily with the Catholic church. Marcion struggled with the problem of evil in the world. He couldn't understand how God would allow evil in the world. He concluded that there must be two Gods: the Creator God of the OT, who was characteristically a God of Law, who involved himself in contradictory courses of action, who was fickle, ignorant, despotic and cruel. The Supreme God, Marcion held, was wholly a God of Love who had remained completely hidden until he was revealed in the person of Jesus Christ. Marcion believed, as the Gnostics, that all matter was an impure creation of the creator god. Jesus as a human represented a theological challenge. Marcion was of the view that Jesus only appeared to have a physical body, but was in reality pure spirit. After doing a lot or research into Marcion it becomes obvious that Marcion had his own edited versions (if not entirely written by him and his followers) of the Pauline letters and the Catholic church created their own edited versions of the Pauline letters which are the ones in the bible today. There very well could have been a historical Paul at one time but his letters (actually more like books) were very possibly created by Marcion and his followers based on the legend of Paul.    Paul's letters contain everything that Marcion and his followers believed in. In Romans 8:3 (resembled sinful flesh), Phil 2:7 (likeness of man), 1 Cor 15:50 ( flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God , 2 Cor 5:16 (if we knew christ in flesh, we know thus no longer) and a lot more in the epistles all have the same belief as Marcion that Jesus was not of flesh and blood. Marcion said \\"our lord was found as man in form and appearance and likeness, but without our body.\\" In the bible, Paul's Jesus is purely a spiritual one preaching the \\"christ within\\" and he never mentions anything about any miracles of Jesus, any teachings of a man from Nazareth, and he never tries to establish a lineage to David.     As for the movie itself, I am aware that this is Hollywood in the 50's. But still this is what people could see as the truth when it is not. Among some of the ludicrous things in this movie are scenes of Paul preaching with Peter sitting at his feet and the fact that these people place crosses in their houses. Keep in mind that this was the 60's CE. It is a known fact that the cross was NOT used as a Christian symbol until much, much later. At one point in Quo Vadis, the Roman general takes the cross that is hanging on the wall and smashes it over his knee. Paul says in Quo Vadis \\"Jesus wishes no man to be in bondage\\" in reference to slavery. In the bible, Jesus mentions NOTHING about the institution of slavery. In fact, he never condemns it at all. He even refers to slaves but never says that it is wrong. Then Paul says that God says that we can't buy human beings. It is a known fact that the God in the bible supports slavery over and over again. My point is that what is shown in this movie with Paul and Peter is just plain wrong. But, the real problem is that this is what most Christians believe. The whole Quo Vadis movie is very, very pro-Christian, just like many 1950's movies were, with even the main Roman general converting to Christianity.     Quo Vadis is almost three hours long and it gets bogged down into a typical 1950's love story. Robert Taylor is obnoxious and dominating too. The romance becomes ridiculous with Deborah Kerr hating him for so long until she completely makes an about face on a whim and immediately falls in love with him. It really is strange to watch. As long as this frame of mind is maintained that it is a typical 1950's Hollywood movie not based in reality at all then  could see how people could find it entertaining in parts. I will say that Peter Ustinov is absolutely wonderful as Nero. He was a truly talented actor who is basically the only thing holding this movie together.

B00009EIQE|5.0|So much of Buddy Guy's recent work is overproduced, guest-star-burdened, and hard-rock-oriented, aiming for the Stevie-Ray-Vaughn-fan market, and his live shows are famously unfocused and unsatisfying, but this album is a little jewel.  Each song is a tribute to a different blues master, and his interpretation of Son House is particularly moving.  Buddy Guy is still the best bluesman around, by far.  This disk proves it.

This edition nowhere states that this is a collection of short stories.  The table of contents does not reflect that this is a collection of short stories.  As you move into the short stories,  the page headers still have \\"I AM LEGEND\\" on the pages.  Hence, my gripe is with the format used to publish this book.<br /><br />So,  awesome story (only read further if you have already read the story) however as you approach page 71 you wonder how Neville is going to escape,  or if Mattheson is daring enough to carry on the story without his lead character.  After Neville realizes he is Legend,  your mind is predisposed to wondering how the next chapters will take shape.<br /><br />Interesting enough will be the movie:  will they stay true to the story,  or adapt the concept of this story to the movie and carry on after what the first 71 pages have offered.<br /><br />Don't misunderstand the review here:  the following short stories are awesome,  but after you finish the first,  and try to realize how Neville is going to be mentioned again,  only then does it dawn on you that I am Legend has already ended!<br /><br />Written in the 1950s or 70s I only hope that the movie adapts this era's genre in the film.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I remember when My So-Called Life first aired on TV. I couldn't believe my luck: A show about truly awkward teens starting out their freshman year, dealing with changing social circles, hormones, sexuality, self-consciousness, all the highs and lows that come with the territory. I was an awkward, undersized freshman when this show originally aired and I loved throwing away reality once a week, imagining myself with these characters, wondering what it would be like to have these people as my friends.     When a young person is coming to terms with who they are becoming, stumbling around in the transition from childhood to adulthood, it can be hell on earth then they realize that they aren't who they thought they would be, they aren't who their parents expected them to be, and they aren't who society says they should be.     There are rules all around us, spoken and unspoken, and we are supposed to follow them or face the consequences. Consequences from those around us - parents, teachers, fellow students, friends and enemies - and even from ourselves.     It was shows like MSCL that told us it's okay to be who you are and though the world may come at you on all sides, you'll get through it. You'll be okay.     No wonder it was cancelled. It's sad to admit that I actually cried when I discovered the news that my favourite show wouldn't be returning next season. I had expected to follow these characters all the way through highschool, sharing those years together. I felt robbed of the opportunity, disillusioned and sad.     Of course, I was a dramatic teen back then and I eventually got over it. When the show was picked up for re-runs, I had my VCR tuned and ready. When it first came out on DVD, I waited for the price to go down. (Which it never did.) And so, finally, it has returned to DVD and it's better than ever.     The best thing about having My So-Called Life in such a nice package as this is sharing it with those who didn't watch it the first time around, and to show a new generation what it was like 'back then'. It really was a different world sometimes and this is a great timecapsule to have, to remember, and to share.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|Having never heard of this movie a week ago, I stumbled onto it and am so thankful for dumb luck. It's not often I find myself obsessing over a movie rental but that's what happened here. 3 viewings and wanting more, at the very least I'll rent this again soon. In the end, I'll buy it on dvd. I wish I could have had a chance to see it in a theater. A quiet, textural movie filled with subtle shadings and emotional color where there is little visual color, The Lives of Others gets deeper every time you see it. You pick up on one more slight gesture or one more hint of something real.<br /><br />I strongly recommend seeing it at least twice. Being subtitled, the first time you watch it you'll naturally be spending a fair amount of time reading it. Try as you might, you'll still miss certain aspects of the performances of these actors. Of special note is Wiesler...Ulrich M&uuml;he... the quiet, ominous Stasi man. I don't question the performances of anyone else in the film, but for me, Ulrich M&uuml;he is the one. This performance and the internal dialog of this character is riveting. He is a perfect book that you don't want to put down even though it's 4am and you have to be up in 3 hours. I've never been to acting school, I haven't seen much theater, and I've never tried to make a movie... heck I've never owned a video camera, but M&uuml;he meets my own personal definition of genius when it comes to acting. I don't even perceive him as acting... I watch this film and I perceive him as being. As IS.<br /><br />This is my favorite new movie I've seen in quite some time. Whereas the last movie I reviewed ([[ASIN:B000FI8MG6 Electric Shadows]]) touched me in a way I can only describe as engaging sentimentality, The Lives of Others is the opposite, and a much stronger film in every way. If someone didn't like Shadows, I could understand that. They'd probably be disliking the very things I liked. This movie though, it's tough for me to think of any adult not being drawn into it.<br /><br />With no sentimentality or feeling of being forced, Others manages to move along with a stoic tenacity where, possibly, one may see that art need not imitate life when it can rise above it.ty or feeling of being forced, Others manages to move along with a stoic tenacity where, possibly, one may see that art need not imitate life when it can rise above it.
0790729393|5.0|I had previously viewed this movie several years ago.  It was a favorite back then and it is today.  I had forgotten the excellent cast and since Minnie Driver is my all time, number one, top of the list, female actresses, it is a DVD that I will treasure and watch again and again over my remaining years.  Who can forget the roles played by Brad Pitt, Robert DeNiro, Kevein Bacon, Jason Priestly, etc, etc, etc.  An excellent movie that did not get the media attention that it deserved.
B000W4KT6E|4.0|As much as I enjoy the original \\"Hairspray\\" featuring Ricki Lake, there's just something about this new version (a blend of the original film and the 2002 Broadway musical) that I really love.  I won't go so far as to say that I prefer this version to the original, but it definitely does not stand in the 1988 film's shadow.  Newcomer Nikki Blonsky takes the reins as Tracy Turnblad, the sweetly rebellious chubby girl who takes a stand (or a dance step) against prejudice and racism in 1962 Baltimore.  All Tracy wants to do is become a featured dancer on the Corny Collins show and woo Link Larkin (Zac Efron, of the \\"High School Musical\\" films).  In order to do that, she has to audition for the show.  After running into a roadblock called Velma Von Tussel (the devilishly funny Michelle Pfeiffer) and not getting to be on the program, she literally dances her way on to the set when she learns a few dance moves from Seaweed (Elijah Kelley), a young black man she meets in school detention.  As the story rolls along, Tracy sees not only racial discrimination, but discrimination of anybody who's just a little bit different than the \\"norm\\" in Baltimore.<br /><br />This story, on the surface, seems very light and happy.  However, it deals with the very real and very serious issue of discrimination on a number of levels.  The race issue is at the forefront, but there are a few other issues at hand.  Tracy's mother (gamely played by John Travolta, although his makeup looks very Muppet-like) struggles with the embarassment of being very overweight.  Tracy's friend, Penny (a very perky Amanda Bynes in a limited role) feels as if she's living in a prison at home.  Link has to make a decision about what's right for everybody and what's right for him career-wise.  Then there's Von Tussel, her daughter (Brittany Snow of \\"John Tucker Must Die\\"), and the local TV station unwilling to integrate the Corny Collins show despite the demands of Collins (a slicked-up James Marsden) and Motormouth Maybelle (Queen Latifah, in a surprisingly excellent performance).<br /><br />The music and dance numbers are excellent, with amazing performances by Blonsky, Kelley, Efron and even Christopher Walken (as Tracy's father).  The songs hearken back to the \\"wall of sound\\" created by Phil Spector.  They are massive and highly enjoyable to listen to.  John Travolta does an excellent job with his vocals, but instead of hearing a woman, I can't help but hear \\"Grease\\" each time he sings in this film.  That's not a bad thing, though, and most folks unfamiliar with Travolta's past musical numbers will probably not even notice it.<br /><br />Director Adam Shankman keeps everything moving at an easily digestable pace and pegs the actors' delivery of one-liners and wicked tunes such as \\"New Girl In Town.\\"<br /><br />There's a little language, a lot of sexual innuendo, one scene of seduction (although it is hilariously one-sided) and some mean-spirited actions that may not be suitable for some youngsters, but I personally have no problem with my six-year-old watching this movie.  The race issues may be a little bit too heavy for younger viewers to comprehend, but I think that most of them will pick up on the generalized issue that some people hate others who are different whether it be due to skin color, weight, or something else.<br /><br />Keep an eye open for a cameo from Ricki Lake and John Waters.  Also watch for Jerry Stiller (Tracy's father in the original film) as Mr. Pinky.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film to anybody over the age of five.  Youngsters will be drawn to the wonderful music and dance numbers.  Older children and adults will pick up on the sneering humor and the issue of discrimination.belle (Queen Latifah, in a surprisingly excellent performance).

B000O176Q6|5.0|If you're a Bruce Lee fan and have a blu-ray player, you have to buy this movie.  Seeing Bruce Lee in high definition in such a classic martial arts film was almost more than I could take!    I won't go into any description of the movie, because I would assume anyone that wanted to see this would've by now.  In regards to the quality, it's not quite as perfect as movies released today, but this transfer is definitely very high quality and much better than any release I've seen.  Highly recommend!
0688014291|4.0|I picked this book up for $1.00 at the local library bookstore. It was a great, quick read. I'd like to give it to every manager at the courthouse that I work in, but I don't think that would go over well. It's obviously very basic, and doesn't provide too much instructional information, but it is still entertaining.
0307387178|5.0|Into the Wild tells the story of Chris McCandless's journey of discovery and tragedy across America and into the wilds of Alaska.  Author Jon Krakauer weaves us through episodes of Chris' life well, filling in various back story elements that reveal the troubled young man's motivations, fears, and accomplishments--the strained relationship with his father, his need for attachment, and his search for true meaning.<br />Krakauer's narrative is denotative and often starkly effective, leaving few holes or weak points.  We likely have all, at some point, thought about running away from it all but have never had the courage.  Like Lee Karis in Dark Day of the Soul, McCandless believed that his life would be better for escaping, protecting what he loved, protecting, he thought, his sanity, only to face a tragic end.
B0002DKCMG|5.0|Paticularly very graceful and full of creative thoughts for the youth in which it frames to us within an adventure that we generally do not like to make, but in certain stages of the life it is good so for making it and not be so \\"predictable\\" with our acts.    I did this review for Carlos Herrera (CJ), so many can understand it.
B000PDYVVG|2.0|Elizabeth Gilbert writes like a women who doesn't know what she wants and wants us all to know it.  She divorced her husband like a woman who doesn't know what she wants but expects him to know.  She has affairs with people who don't know what she wants and can't provide it, and she prays to God like a woman who has no idea what she wants except that new Spiritual insight that she won't know what to do with if she gets it.<br />What a depressing ride.  If any of my friends were like Gilbert, I would tell them to please stop hurting my ears and do what Dorothy Gale did.  At the risk of sounding trite, she realized that, if she couldn't find happiness in her own back yard, then it wasn't worth searching for in the first place.<br />Certainly if you want to learn little to nothing about life, and certainly nothing at all about what makes life happy and marriage good, then spend your money on this journey through female midlife hell.  If you love a good whine with your dinner, have an adventure.
B000W04S6U|5.0|Martin O'Donnel and Michael Salvatori have worked wonders for the Halo franchise, making iconic music that is both emotional and rememberable.  This album is a must buy for anyone interested in music in gaming or interactive media (not to mention a staple for halo fans).  5 stars.
0977326403|1.0|I agree that there is a need for greatness, but stating that business thinking is not the answer???  Yes in the non-profit and government sectors there is no profit.  But to go from Good To Great you still need to follow business practices.  This book is is really talking about the organization behavior.  With the US having an economy that is based in a monetary system you can't ignore the fact that in any organization there will be a need to take business process and money into consideration.  I would have given this a high review if the author stated that there is another side to the story.
B000T2PRF2|4.0|The CD is a pretty good compliation of songs from Diana's albums but what got me to buy this was the DVD.     Unfortunately the DVD is not very good.  The aspect ratio in the first video is out of whack.  The studio in the house videos are pretty good and the one live concert video is okay but I really expected more.  In all of the videos Diana seems incredibly self absorbed.     Given the price differential,  if you need a \\"best of\\" CD you still are better off getting this edition with the DVD.  Just don't expect too much.
0143038583|5.0|A well-researched, well-written, and thought-provoking book. It sheds light on the current American way of food production and processing (conventional and organic), and its impact on humans, animals, and the environment.  Although one may reasonably quibble with a few assumptions, such as equating science with reductionism, I recommend this book if you want to know more about the food's journey from the farms to the supermarkets and restaurants.
075640407X|5.0|This is my favorite new fantasy since \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell.\\"  Like \\"Jonathan Strange\\", it moves at a measured pace, unfolding the plot and the characters bit by bit.  The world is rich, and the system of magic is believable and original.  The true highlight of the story, however, is the characters.  They are rich and human - exceptionally well-realized.  I recommend this book to fans of Robin Hobb's \\"Farseer\\" trilogy, and anyone who likes thoughtful, well-written fantasy.  Be forewarned, though - this is the first book of a trilogy, and the sequel isn't scheduled to arrive until 2009.
B000002KXV|1.0|As a Steely Dan fan, I wanted to like Donald Fagen's first solo album, I really did. But there's very little that's Dan-like here, and much of it sounds cheesy. In fact, two or three tracks sound like Jimmy Buffett rejects (and that's not a swipe at Buffett, of whom I'm also a fan). Certainly the two modern-era Steely Dan albums (Two Against Nature and Everything Must Go) are better than this.

B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I bought this cd mainly to see what Britney Spears would come up with because according to the media she is a washed up has-been.  Well let me tell you she can't be all that 'out there' because this cd is good and I mean really good.      Go Britney.
B00011F5DK|5.0|I got this game for my dad's 79th birthday so he'd have something to keep his mind active and also play with my kids (5 and 7).  They all enjoy it.  The rules are simple enough both the 5 and 79 year old can play it, but complicated enough in play to keep everyone engaged.  The game time is about 20-30 min., so you can slip quick games into busy schedules. Plus, the kids beat the adults the first time we played, so they are excited about playing again.  Another plus--you can play it alone or with up to 4 people (more if you had teams).  The rating of 4 for durability is because the game tiles get scratched up easily, dulling the jewellike tones, but that does not interfere with playing the game, just looks.
B000002GLV|5.0|I first bought this \\"album\\" in the early 70's. No telling whatever happened to it after numerous moves and room mates. I had quite frankly forgotten about it. I have listened to Turning Point many times, in fact wore out a CD if that's possible. I bought it as an add on with Amazon, to get the free shipping. This is truly a classic and with 23 out of 23 reviews a 5* I guess that says it all. You just don't get any better than John Mayall, and this is definitely one of his best.
B000UR9TQE|5.0|In a current Guitar World interview, Jimmy Page explains why this film has always had \\"sync\\" problems.      Per Jimmy, after the MSG concert, they looked at the footage and realized that the director \\"missed\\" certain parts of the performances, and that they actually needed more footage.     So they later set up a replica of the MSG stage in a controlled environment and filmed the band lip-syncing and \\"playing along\\" with the film soundtrack to get the required footage.  However, according to Jimmy, it was difficult for him to accurately mimic what he actually played at the concert because a lot of it was improvised on the spot at MSG.      So that's why there were sync problems between the performances and the visuals.  Per Jimmy, on this release, they were unable to change even a single frame of the film, but they were able to tweak the sound to make it match better.     This release is definitely an improvement and this is the best this film has ever looked.  The sound is great and the four bonus live tracks on the second disk are wonderful, especially \\"Over the Hills\\".       Zep is great but I think it's an un-even film that spends too much time on the local NY flavor and fantasy sequences.  Heck, the live concert doesn't even begin until chapter six!  The fantasy sequences of course are pretty dated by now, and it all makes one wish that they had included just the concert performances on a seperate disk without all the other stuff.      But - This is still the mighty Zep, and Page is in awesome form, and this film has never looked or sounded better.  Turn it up!
B000VNMMQ6|2.0|This was an excellent movie at the cinema in the UK, done a terrible injustice in this Blu-Ray rip-off...     But even worse, for us Brits, is the fact that Amazon's information for multi-region users, usually very good, is way, way off... and buyers outside of the Region A will be finding that this movie is not, as Amazon report, 'All Regions', it is in fact a strictly locked Region A.    Useless information to those of us who import our quality entertainment.
B000065U1N|5.0|Last week, including the weekend, I watched three great war action movies on television, namely:<br /><br />1) 'Black Hawk Down', starring Josh Hartnett, Tom Sizemore, Eric Bana;<br /><br />2) 'Behind Enemy Lines', starring Owen Wilson, Gene Hackman;<br /><br />3) 'Tears of the Sun', starring Bruce Willis, Monica Bellucci, Tom Skerritt;<br /><br />The first movie was based on an actual event that took place in Mogadishu, Somalia on the African continent in October 1993 during the Clinton presidency.<br /><br />The second movie was apparently a fictional adaptation of an actual event that supposedly took place during the Bosnia-Serbia conflict.<br /><br />The third movie was more of a fictional account that had the starvation-ravaged Nigeria caught in an ethnic civil war as a background setting.<br /><br />In the war action movie, 'Black Hawk Down', directed by Ridley Scott (behind 'Gladiator', 'Blake Runner'), an elite team of some hundred US Army Rangers & Delta Force operatives were dropped deep into the capital city of Somalia, Mogadishu one day in October 1993.<br /><br />It was the stronghold of the powerful warlord, Mohammed Farrah Aidid, who had been hijacking International Red Cross food shipments at the ports with the intention to used them as bargaining chips with the United Nations.<br /><br />The mission was to capture two top lieutenants of the warlord.<br /><br />It was perceived as a quick straight-forward extraction, 30 minutes the most, but it turned out to be a 18-hour nightmarish ordeal for the US soldiers on the ground.<br /><br />Probably due to poor intelligence, they soon found themselves separated on the ground - & outnumbered - in a desperate street corner battle with a large group of heavily-armed Somali gunmen, following the early unexpected destruction of two of their Black Hawk rescue helicopters.<br /><br />For the next 90 minutes or so, the entire movie then traced the heroic efforts by other fellow army rangers to rescue their comrades (Well, they certainly lived up to their military creed 'Leave No Man Behind'), starting with Sgt. Eversmann (Josh Hartnett), commanding one unit named Chalk IV & leading his men to the first Black Hawk crash site...<br /><br />to Warrant Officer Durant (Ron Eldard), who was the only survivor of the second Black Hawk crash site & who was captured by Somali gunmen...<br /><br />to the gung-ho Lt. Col. McKnight (Tom Sizemore) who led a rescue convoy only to get lost in an unforgiving city...<br /><br />to Sgt. Sanderson (William Fichner) who was desperately trying to reach the first Black Hawk crash site...<br /><br />to Staff Sgt. Yurek (Tom Guiry) who led two fellow Rangers, Nelson (Ewen Bremmer) & Twanbly (Tom Hardy) to meet up with their squad, Chalk IV, at the first Black Hawk crash site.<br />With all the bullets whizzing past & explosive sounds of gunfire, & of course, empty shells with blood splattering all over the bodies as well as places, the movie was quite confusing at first, as it was difficult to track who was who, although the soldiers' names were tagged to their individual helmets.<br /><br />The gritty realism of the movie really put me into the middle of hellish horror faced by all the young US solders.<br /><br />There were chilling moments, for example:<br /><br />[When Warrant Officer Durant was captured & brought for interrogation]<br /><br />Durrant: \\"My government will never negotiate for me.\\"<br /><br />Interrogator: \\"Then perhaps you & I can negotiate, huh? Soldier to soldier.\\"<br /><br />Durant: \\"I am not in charge.\\"<br /><br />Interrogator: \\"Course not, you have the power to kill, but not negotiate. In Somalia, killing is negotiation.\\"<br /><br />The following further comment by the interrogator really exposed the harsh reality of the situation:<br /><br />\\"Do you think if you get General Aidid, we will simply put down our weapons & adopt American democracy? That the killing will stop? We know this, without victory, there will be no peace. There will always be killing, see? This is how things are in our world.\\"<br /><br />There were also some comic moments. For example:<br /><br />[During a cross fire near the Black Hawk crash site.]<br /><br />Grimes: \\"Why aren't you shooting?\\"<br /><br />Waddell: \\"We're not being shot at yet.\\"<br /><br />Grimes: \\"How can you tell?\\"<br /><br />Waddell: \\"A hiss means it's close. A snap means...\\"<br /><br />[A bullet whizzed past, pretty close.]<br /><br />Waddell: \\"Now, they're shooting at us!\\"<br /><br />[They began returning fire.]<br /><br />For me, this intense movie certainly captured the emotional fears, raw courage & selfless heroism of the US soldiers against nearly insurmountable odds.<br /><br />At the end, nineteen of them perished, not counting probably the thousands of Somali people who also died in the cross fire.<br /><br />I enjoyed watching the movie, for the reasonably good acting, despite the fact that the movie did not centre on any single character, the pulsating action sequences, the comic as well as tearful moments, & the beautiful cinematography.<br /><br />I particularly like the dialogue towards the ending, when Sgt. Norm Hooten (Eric Bana) said to Sgt. Eversmann (Josh Hartnett):<br /><br />\\"When I go home, people will ask me, \\"Hey, Hoot, why do you do it, man? What, you some kind of a war junkie?\\" You know what I'll say? I won't say a goddamn word. Why? They won't understand why we do it. They won't understand that it's about the men next to you, & that's all it is.\\"<br /><br />What a profound response from a true soldier as well as a good human being.<br /><br />The final scene through the film credits was also very poignant, as I watched nineteen coffins slowly being loaded on to a 130-Hercules transport, with the loading ramp slowly closing.<br /><br />I believe the opening quote from Plato at the movie's beginning, \\"Only the dead have seen an end to war,\\" truly reflects my emotional sentiments about the movie.<br /><br />According to history, it was the Malaysian and Pakistani contingents based in Somalia under the United Nations command that actually made the final rescue & eventually escorted the surviving US Army rangers & Delta Force operatives out of harm's way.<br /><br />[In that final scene, it was quite funny, & scary at the same time too, to watch the surviving US soldiers, seemingly exhausted, having to run on foot, & obviously unprotected, behind the escort convoy, with a ragtag group of Somali gunmen on pick-up trucks chasing them.]<br /><br />This vital part of history was apparently downplayed in the movie. I guess that's Hollywood's prerogative.<br /><br />My end analysis: this is one hell of a good war action movie to watch!<br /><br />To sum up all the three war action movies in the foregoing posts, I want to take this opportunity to share with readers a dedication statement I had learned - & remembered - since my secondary school days. It came from Sir Winston Churchill, the wartime British Prime Minister:<br /><br />\\"Never in the field of human conflict, have so many owed so much to so few.\\"<br /><br />So, dear readers, please go & watch the three foregoing war action movies.

B000TLYELG|1.0|This gives me great sorrow to write this about one of my favorite artists and who prides himself as a recording perfectionist!    We waited 13 years for this masterpiece to be remastered by Alan, who used to be the king of audiophile remasters, and I was stunned and shocked when I played it!  The Mobile Fidelity version from 1994 smokes this version.  This version is flat, VERY bright and hashy, has no body and warmth, and seems as if it is a compressed MP3 version on CD.     I also bought the Japan mini LP CD of this new release and same big disappointment with the remastering.    All my other latest remasters, such as Rush and Steely Dan, etc., sound way better than their MFSL counterparts, BUT not AP!!     Booklets and Bonus Tracks??  Who cares if the remaster sucks!!  It should be about the music not the extras.     I can not believe AP really supervised this remaster, and if so, something must be wrong!    All we can hope for now is that it will be done in DVD-Audio by someone else.    I agree--after this release, I will NOT repurchase the rest of the APP rerelease catalogue!!    What a shame!
B00005JKL8|5.0|Last week, including the weekend, I watched three great war action movies on television, namely:<br /><br />1) 'Black Hawk Down', starring Josh Hartnett, Tom Sizemore, Eric Bana;<br /><br />2) 'Behind Enemy Lines', starring Owen Wilson, Gene Hackman;<br /><br />3) 'Tears of the Sun', starring Bruce Willis, Monica Bellucci, Tom Skerritt;<br /><br />The first movie was based on an actual event that took place in Mogadishu, Somalia on the African continent in October 1993 during the Clinton presidency.<br /><br />The second movie was apparently a fictional adaptation of an actual event that supposedly took place during the Bosnia-Serbia conflict.<br /><br />The third movie was more of a fictional account that had the starvation-ravaged Nigeria caught in an ethnic civil war as a background setting.<br /><br />In the war action movie, 'Behind Enemy Lines', a US Navy navigator, Lt. Chris Burnett (Owen Wilson) was cajoled by his commanding officer, Admiral Leslie Reigart (Gene Hackman) to take on one last reconnaisance flight from an aircraft carrier on the Adriatic Sea.<br /><br />He was assigned to accompany a navy pilot, Lt. Stackhouse (Gabriel Macht), who would fly over the supposedly southern part of Bosnia. The action supposedly took place during the tail-end of the Bosnia-Serbia conflict.<br /><br />The recon flight deliberately went off course, after Chris had apparently spotted something unusual on the ground. Pictures were captured by the plane's video camera, but he did not realise that there were unseen forces on the ground that did not want the world to see those pictures.<br /><br />The plane was eventually shot down by a surface-to-air (SAM) missile. However, both the pilot & his navigator parachuted just in time. The extensive evasive actions by the pilot & the plane formed the initial action sequences of the movie - exciting, but somehow unbelievable.<br /><br />The pilot was captured & executed on the landed spot, while Chris, who had witnessed the gruesome event, managed to escape into the woods.<br /><br />The rest of the movie traced his own battle of wits as he outsmarted as well as out-manuevred his enemies on the ground to get help from his commanding officer, who unwittingly founded that his intended rescue operation was apparently hamstrung by political wrangling at the top of his chain of command.<br /><br />There was this funny guy in the sports track suit who played the determined sniper, who was assigned by enemy forces to track down Chris, locate the crash site & retrieve the damaging video pictures.<br /><br />It was quite fun, actually for a change, to watch Owen Wilson, with his crooked nose, playing a serious & sober character in the movie. I had seen in other movies where he was often seen to be a mischievous, playful, 'trouble maker', like in 'I Spy', 'Shanghai Noon', 'Shanghai Knights', 'Starsky & Hutch', 'Wedding Crashers', just to name a few.<br /><br />Gene Hackman, one of my favourite actors, seemed to have an understated role, but I simply love his character in the movie. At the risk of his own career, he eventually took personal command & led the successful rescue attempt (\\"Let's go & get our boy back!\\"). He was ultimately relinguished of the command of the battle group, & reassigned to a desk job in Washington, but chose to retire from service, in honour of his men.<br /><br />Sometimes, a man just has to do what he needs to do, even at the risk of his own personal future. To me, this is leadership, taking personal responsibility.<br /><br />The final segment of the movie exhibited the spectacular rescue attempt of the downed navigator.<br /><br />Our hero, during the very last few moments of being rescued, ran for cover from the blazing guns of the pursuing enemy forces, halted half-way, back-tracked, made one final attempt to search for, retrieved the video cartridge from the plane's crash site, & then leaped into the air over the cliff hanger & into the receiving arms of a marine, dangling on a tight rope from the rescue helicopter. Wow! that was really cool!<br /><br />He wanted the world to see the damaging video, so that his pilot friend did not die in vain. That was his greatest defining moment in the movie, which I certainly enjoyed watching.<br /><br />My end analysis: despite some minor technical flaws in the story, this is still another good war action movie to watch!<br /><br />To sum up all the three war action movies in the foregoing posts, I want to take this opportunity to share with readers a dedication statement I had learned - & remembered - since my secondary school days.

1596912855|4.0|Something I discovered long ago when I visited Shannon Hale's web site: she's funny. Really funny. She has this hilarious satirical edge, surprising me into laughing out loud at her unexpected honesty or her sudden flagrant absurdity. She's got good comic timing too, something difficult to find in the written word. I wondered why that delightful, saucy voice never came out in her fantasy novels.<br /><br />Now it has. In Austenland, Shannon Hale finally lets her hair down and makes us laugh; at ourselves, at people who wish they lived on a country estate in Regency England, at the sad absurdity of the modern dating scene, and at her leading lady's wit, insight, and hijinks.<br /><br />Be warned, THIS IS NOT A CHILDRENS' BOOK. In fact, I thought I could sense Hale trying a bit too hard to be adult. Nothing flagrantly distasteful happens on the page, but still, I'm not letting my daughter read it until she's much older and has watched a lot of those Jane Austen movie adaptations.<br /><br />In Austenland, Jane, our leading lady, is bequeathed an all expense paid vacation to an obscure resort in England where the guests are required to spend three weeks dressing in gowns and corsets and acting like it is 1802. Jane figures this will cure her of her obsession with Colin Firth once and for all. Intriguing premise! As the story unfolds Jane swings between trying to buck the system and trying to put her whole heart into the act, wondering in between just how much of it is real.<br /><br />Towards the end of the story when Jane realizes just how fake everyone and everything on this vacation has been, I eagerly anticipated a return to the real world. I must say I was disappointed by the denouement. Sure, I expected at least one of the actors to really fall in love with Jane, but it could have been handled with more realism, in contrast to all that fake-y stuff that came earlier.<br /><br />In spite of the slight let down at the end, the book gave me a lot to think about. Is fantasy a place to prepare for the real world, or is it a worthless escape? Hale puts forth both ideas because both can be true. I believe the important thing to remember is that it is all real. Our fantasies are real fantasies, we really have them, and we shouldn't pretend we're not accountable for them. They have the power shape us, perhaps even more power than \\"real\\" external events have to shape us. This is one of my favorite themes in fiction, and Austenland has plenty to say about it.world, or is it a worthless escape? Hale puts forth both ideas because both can be true.

B000KX0IOK|2.0|Dan Dunne takes drugs often, they are running his life, and he also teaches history. He is dealing with students that live with less than perfect circumstances, and he is an inspiration to them, this I can tell is what I am supposed to believe. He has hangovers, and trouble focusing often in class, and I just find him boring during the scenes that are examples of how he is meaningful to these students. One student, Drey, makes an impression on him. She cares for him still, even though she knows about his drug issues. He appreciates her, because she appreciates him, and because she has a spirit that one can hope will carry her past her present life situation to one where her intelligence will benefit her in good ways.    There is a quietness about this film that is supposed to bring about a documentary feel perhaps, or maybe the feel of a European film. I don't even really know what I was supposed to feel about all of this, now that I really think about. Yes, the teacher would be better off not taking drugs, especially before teaching class. Yes, the actress that plays Drey is very talented. I got very restless trying to focus on this film.
B000Q6GXW2|3.0|I just bought an HD DVD player, and the first HD DVD I watched was 300.  The picture looked really \\"grainy\\" or \\"pixelly\\".  I'm just wondering if anyone else has this issue, since all of my other HD DVDs looked amazing.  I was really disappointed in how \\"unclear\\" it was.

Here's an example of what you will find.<br /><br />New socks.<br />Two socks.<br />Whose socks?<br />Sue's socks.<br /><br />As with most Seuss books the words the sentences start out simple and then get more complicated so that children can sort of 'warm up' to the reading.

1594489505|5.0|This is a beautifully written book and definitely one of the very best to come out in any genre in 2007. Get ready to be emotionally rocked by Khaled Hosseini in this novel of struggle and love. While The Kite Runner was about childhood and friendship, this novel walks the reader through the lives of two Afghan women, brought together by tragic fate. It will give the reader insight into the atrocities of the Taliban and the extremely conservative culture of Afghanistan. The culture is very colorful and intriguing at times but it is not always fair. Women are the victims of a male-dominated society, specially when the Taliban are in power and they cannot even travel without being accompanied by a male relative. This book is going to make you cry with both sadness and marvel.
B0000024LN|5.0|Two years since his last album, the Funk Doc returns with his 3rd, and arguably his best album, in my opinion it is.  I've been a fan of Redman since EPMD's 1992 track \\"Head Banger\\", but never really listened to him until this album.  The lyrics are on point and the production is on point, even the guests fit in well through the album.  With 17 songs on here, you get no bad tracks, really none of them are even ok, they're all good, great, or classic material.  Guests are on just 5 songs, and as I said earlier, all hold their own rather well and fit the bill.  Production is very good and handle dby Erick Sermon (8 songs), Redman (5 songs), Rockwilder (2 songs), and Ty Fyfee & Pras each do 1 song.

0440238609|5.0|It's fun going through and reading all the different reviews for these books.  There is a group of reviews, each consisting of one or two sentences, which all say basically \\"Pullman is an atheist, beware of your children getting their hands on these books or seeing the movie coming out on December 7th.\\"  These people all give the books one star, although they've obviously never read the books, and I can only guess that their priest or minister has asked them to campaign against these books and the movie (coming out on December 7th).    There is another group of reviewers, much more clever and cunning, who pretend to have read the books, or at least pretend to have started reading them, who claim that the books are badly written, the plot is difficult to follow, the main characters are unlikeable, and the books are just, well, STUPID.  These reviewers often claim to be very open-minded, and that they just loved Harry Potter, Tolkien, Lewis, etc.  If I was reading these reviews to see if I might want to buy this series, these are the types of reviews which may cause me to think twice, much more than the ones stating the Pullman is an evil atheist with an agenda.    But as someone who has read this series twice over the past decade, let me assure you, these books are great.  They are filled with complex, but very loveable, characters.  There is adventure and danger, bravery against great evil, and the writing is anything but stupid or boring.    I would recommend this series to any smart kids or adults.
B000UJ48O0|5.0|This DVD set is a great package for any OC fan.  Especially with the added bonuses such as season 1 being presented in widescreen format for the first time.  Another great added feature is the season 4 blooper reel which shows that the cast still seemed to be having fun filming the show in season 4 that they had while filming season 1.  As for The OC as a show, it wasn't Shakespeare, but it was a great escape from the hectic lives we all lead.  The stand-out performers from the series are Rachel Bilson (who made a smooth transition from making the character of Summer Roberts a b*tchy one-dimensional character to making her the most beloved characters of the series), Melinda Clarke (Julie Cooper could have easily have been just a standard antagonist,  but Melinda Clarke made Julie a character you rooted for, even when she was doing less than good deeds), Adam Brody (who's portrayal of Seth Cohen defined the term 'geek-chic'), and a breath of fresh air was brought in season 4 by the delightful Autumn Reeser (took the character of Taylor Townsend from being the annoying girl in season 3 to the lovable and neurotic love interests of Ryan in season 4).  Season 1- The season that started it all.  The show debuted in August and went from being 'The new 90210' to being a pop-culture phenomenon.  The excellence of the first season might also have been the shows downfall since so much story was told in one season that the show sometimes had trouble finding material in further seasons.  The only lowpoint of the season is the character of Oliver, but the show quickly recovered and finished off the rest of the first season in style.  Season 2- The show started off on a shaky note with the main core characters (Summer, Ryan, Seth and Marissa) not being together and functioning as the friends we fell in love with in season 1.  The show suffered from something that many other shows suffer from as well, it tried to introduce too many new characters instead of focusing on the ones weloved in the first season.  But the show came back together mid-way through season 2 and ended with an explosive finale.  Highlights of the season include 'The Mallpisode' and Kelly Rowan's amazing portrayal of playing the perfect mom of Kirsten to slipping to alcohol abuse.  Season 3- The show kicked off it's third year tying up loose ends from the season 2 finale.  It then quickly kicked in to high soap-opera style by milking the melodramatic and losing the humor that the show once had.  Many see this season as the point in the series when people started to lose interests.  The show was no longer the fun escapism that it once was because instead of forgeting about ones own problems they were instead forced to endure the many problems of the characters on the show.  Most of these problems were brought on by the character of Marissa.  Her character over the course of three seasons went through more problems and storylines then most other character go through over a 5+ season series run.  The show finally seemed to be heading in the right direction in the final two episodes.  The season finale ended on the most shocking cliffhanger the series ever had.  The death of a major character.  Highlight of the season is 'The Graduates' this episode ended our core characters high school life in perfect OC fashion and ended on a note that no viewers saw coming.  Season 4- The 4th season of the show brought The OC back to basics.  It beautifully combined the drama and the humor the show did so well in season 1.  In light of the tragic events of the season 3 finale they were able to bring the show back out of the dark hole they fell in to and had some fun once again.  Summers change from the spoiled Newport girl to the activist animal-lover was a delight to see and Rachel Bilson portrayed this beautifully.  Willa Holland and Autumn Reeser were both welcome additions to the cast bringing fun to the show in their potrayals of Kaitlin Cooper and Taylor Townsend.  Melinda Clarke was a stand-out performer in the show's final season.  Her portrayal of a grieving mother out for vengence was well done and her love triangle towards the end of the season was fun to witness.  As the show wound down many wondered if they could end the show in the same style they began with, luckily, they did.  The final episode perfectly wrapped up four years of one of the best teen dramas produced.  The final few minutes of the series can only be described as perfect, because it wrapped up each character in a way that satisfied viewers.  All in all, if you're going to end a series, you want to hope and pray you end it on a good note like the OC did.  To be able to have their final year be just as good as the first is a great accomplishment that the show runners should be very proud of.  Highlights of the final season are Summer's five-steps of grief scene, and the episodes, 'The Shake-Up' and 'The End is Not Near, It's Here.'    Over all, I've enjoyed watching this series and seeing it's progression over the years.  While it had some episodes that were far less than perfect, for the most part it was always a show I could count on to entertain me.  If you already own the previous seasons in their individual sets then this may not be a necessary buy, but if you don't own the series yet then I definitely reccomend it.  An A+ set for such a delightful show.
B000VDDDY6|4.0|Well, I have read many reviews on the Star Trek original series HD release. I bought it yesterday even though it was expensive at $129.99.  I don't own any of the original series DVD's, so I didn't feel so bad buying them.  I hear some people complain about having to buy them again, which I do understand.   Anyway, I was in heaven watching the episodes last night.  I love the newly recorded theme music and the special effect and everything about the package.  The quality if excellent.   I don't have HD TV and so watched it on Standard DVD.  And still thoroughly enjoyed it.  I don't care for the fact that I was forced to pay for the HD discs.  But who knows, maybe someday I will actually be able to watch them in high definition.
B00008BRB5|4.0|This was The Police's last album, and it was also its best. It was also its most popular album: when it came out, in 1983, I was 15, and I remember all my high school classmates were listening to it all the time. There is the hit single Every Breath you Take (a tale of a disturbed stalker disguised as a love song), the faux-oriental Wrapped Around your Finger (who can't forget Sting in the video dressed as a martial artist jumping around the burning candles?), the great Synchronicity II (great lyrics, and with the trio singing in the video in a sort of post industrial wasteland), King of Pain. Sting's pretentiousness as a lyricist is so over the top that it can be almost touching: Tea in the Sahara was inspired by Paul Bowles' novel The sheltering Sky, the title track is reportedly inspired by writings of Koestler. And what other pop artist of the 80s would mention Scylla and Charybdis (as he does in Wrapped...) or Spiritus Mundi (in the title track)?
B0009MAP9A|5.0|This album reflects the roots of the 'dylan sound'.  And the lyrics are amazing.  Good product, quick shipping, I am happy!
B00008PC2O|5.0|TERMINATOR 2  DVD<br /><br />The true beauty of TERMINATOR 2 is its undying loyalty and respect for its predecessor, made some eight years before. Even though there was such a gap in time, Cameron remained faithful to his original production, which translates into a seamless and believable sequel. The T-800 machine, the nemesis in the original \\"Terminator,\\" returns, only this time the cyborg has been programmed to protect John Connor (Edward Furlong), now a pre-adolescent. And once again, Schwarzenegger was made for the role of the T-800: a stoic, hulking, violent killing machine, yet this time, Arnold brings a discreet sense of humor and compassion to the part.<br />Linda Hamilton returns as Sarah Connor, young mother of John, but now she's buffed and tough and ready to fight back. And Robert Patrick is exceptional as the advanced T-1000 Model, the machine programmed to kill John--a machine so advanced it makes the T-800 look like an old Commodore PC. The action, the effects, the story, is spellbinding, but again, the subtle and not-so-subtle parallels to the original \\"Terminator\\" are what impressed me the most.<br />Highly recommended for fans of Arnold, the Terminator, and Science Fiction movies.<br /><br />Gunner  January, 2008
B000I2MRHE|4.0|I bought this for my daughter who has Down syndrome and isn't crawling yet (9.5 months).  She has very low muscle tone, and I thought that this would help her use her arms and legs while it held her body up for her, since she can't do that herself.  It works great; however, I was kind of upset to find that the weight limit for the center portion is only 22 pounds.  She loves the playmat,and we'll still get use out of it after she exceeds the 22 pound mark.  Had I known that limit, I may not have purchased it because she's pretty close to 22 now. For a \\"normal\\" baby, though, this seems like a great product.
B000UGG39Q|4.0|\\"Over the Under\\" is the is the third and much anticipated release from DOWN. I like it but, not as much as the first two. It didn't have the same feel as NOLA and Down II / A Bustle in your Hederow. Songs like Bury me in smoke, Losing all and Where I'm going all have a smoldering slow groove, that \\"feel\\" was not on this alblum. Don't get me wrong it still rocks but, if you are expecting what you got on the first two you will have to re-adjust your expectations bit.
0143038419|3.0|I did enjoy this book and was sorry when it ended.  Loved her honesty and forthrightness overall.  A couple of negatives:    ... self-absorbed - author is very self-absorbed but I found it more amusing than irritating.  When she was searching for the one word that would describe her, my suggestion was 'needy.'  That's not what she came up with but that would be my assessment.  I'm guessing 75% of the book uses the words I, me, or my.    ... ending - I was disappointed in the ending and her long description of island vigil from a few years prior.  All it did was stop the momentum that had been going while in Bali.    I know this was a memoir but more about the locations and less about self would have been better.  The most interesting parts were when she described the cultural nuances that we may never hear about otherwise.  The ending was inadequate as I felt like I'd come a long way reading but to no avail.  Would have liked to have heard more about life since and after the III trip.
0743454537|5.0|I have recently discovered Jodi Picoult, and for those of you who still don't know her, you don't know what you are missing! The way she writes, you actually feel like you are living the stories. This book is my favorite so far. It really makes you question how you would act if you were faced with a child fighting leukemia. You can't help feel for Sara, because of what she is going through, and on the other hand, despise her for putting her healthy daughter through dozen's of surgeries to try and save the sick child's life. As a parent, I found the story heartwarming, but also extremly hard to read, because you can't help but think of yourself in that position. I won't give away the end, but I will say that it is a twist you will never see coming. That is the way Jodi Picoult writes: she incorporates a twist within the last page or two. I love mysteries and am usually good at figuring out what is going to happen, but not this book. All around, it is a heartwarming, heartbreaking story that people will be talking about for years to come. This is a must have for any book lover!
0143038419|5.0|This book is so hard to put down.  Gilbert's story is funny, fascinating, and full of history of Italy.  Love it!!!!
B000MCH5P4|5.0|I thought \\"Babel\\" was a story done exceptionally well.<br />It is actually three stories in one. They appear to be nonrelated, but come together neatly as the story progresses.<br /><br />One story involves Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchette as Husband and Wife, on a vacation in Morroco, where a terrible accident occurs.<br />One story involves two young boys who are natives from there.<br />One story involves a Japenese girl and her search for love/attention,<br />and yet, another story involves a Hispanic woman in charge of two caucassian children.<br /><br />All seem a lifetime and a world apart, yet they all connect in an extraordinary way.<br />Sometimes painful, sometimes very touching.<br /><br />In my opinion, this movie speaks volumes of how alike we all really are.<br />Well written, directed, and acted, I thought it to be very entertaining, and give it 5 stars plus.
B00005MP58|5.0|This movie stays in my DVD player. I cannot get enough of Mr. Darcy...Need I say more?    Very well made. Great actors...Jane Austen is a favorite of mine. But this movie is the best of all.
B000UCEJEQ|4.0|This CD is not Diva, not Medusa, and not Bare.  It's actually all of them!  It seems that each of Annie's solo efforts has a different twist to it.  If you listen carefully and you happen to be a Eurythmics fan, you may actually hear echos of styles heard on records before Eurythmics were even popular in the US.  There is no one on earth who can capture the pain and suffering of being human the way Annie does.  There are always songs in her collections that highlight world-weariness, emotional pain and self-loathing.  They are the most beautiful \\"downers\\" put to music.  It seems that perhaps her music becomes a bit less \\"danceable\\" as she herself matures with age.  However, there are still a couple of numbers that are definitely \\"groove-worthy\\".  That said, I'm sure that those who were not more appreciative of the effort felt that there wasn't enough of whatthey had heard on previous favorite Lennox CDs.
0143038583|3.0|Overall, I like this book. You'll learn a lot, no matter who you are, about sustainability and why it's important.  The book gives a graphic, sometimes disturbing account of what goes into a mass-produced meal. It tells you specifically why there has been so much food-borne illness and what people can do to stop it. It talks about the economy and how farmers pick what they do and why it's good or bad.  It even gets down to taste and how the way things are produced affects it.  It's beautifully written and really tells an excellent story. At times you feel like you're on the farm right alongside the author smelling the air and touching the grass.    However there are times in this book it gets so scientific and detailed if you are just a casual or curious reader your eyes my glaze over and you'll find yourself reading a passage over a few times with a confused 'what?'  Also the last chapter... the one where the author discusses a meal he creates himself... is extremely self-serving. It's a total change from the rest of the book to the point it almost ruins it. Totally different writing style, that's almost romantic fiction about the bliss of food production.      That last chapter is why I give a somewhat tepid review.
0525950079|5.0|This epic is a worthy successor to the excellent \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" --- which incidentally is now an Oprah Book Club selection. The time elapsed between the writing of \\"Pillars\\" and the writing of \\"World\\" (18 years)is actually a good thing because you don't need to worry about making any comparisions, whether you read the first book or not. I enjoyed this book by reading a chapter a day, and savored each plot twist and turn. By the time I finished the book, I wanted it to keep going! Follett is very skilled in character development, interwoven plots, and in the unfolding of both the foibles and positive aspects of human nature. His grasp of history is craftsman-like, and his careful research and writing over 3 years is evident. This work is historical fiction at its most compelling, making you want to go back in time and actually be there with the characters. Lastly, Follett makes you feel that our basic 21st century emotions, problems, and strivings are not that far removed from those probably experienced by the people who lived in the 14th century.
B000VECAEO|5.0|I'm a Seinfeld addict.    It is a long wish come true. I remember the days, when I was searching  for the ENTIRE series in VCD later DVD form. I found some vendor in UK,  but it was outrageously expensive.    I resorted to taping the entire series in VHS tapes. I had 12 of them!  Once the series started to come on DVD's - it was just unbelievable and  even letting go those almost dead tapes were hard :)    Have bought the entire series ( thro' Amazon ), this is surely my  precious collection.    The final DVD has one segment in the extras which I like the most -   Jerry, Larry David, Elane, George and Kramer talk about the series.    The words from Jerry that 'one of the reason I think as why this was so  successful was it was so close to reality that every body could relate   to'. He is absolutely correct on that point.    This was/still is so close and relatable to our daily life that we can  see and feel the humour in it, as we go thro' those moments - roaming in   a parking lot, waiting during a dr. appointment, being hungry and waiting  in a chinese restaurant, getting marketing calls etc. etc. etc.    Hats off to Jerry, Larry and the un-imaginable dialogue-writers, who made  this series so rich and unique.
0525950079|5.0|Ken Follett is the king of historical novels. World Without End is a crackling good read that will leave you enlightened, educated and wanting more. The characters are so well developed that I found myself alternately enraged, aroused, cheering and on the verge of tears at many points in the story. If I have one complaint it is the association/description of \\"Archbishop\\" the cat with treachery. This only serves to strengthen the sterotype of felines as malevolent. How much better it would have been to highlight the positive role cats played in keeping grain stores free of devouring rats and quite possibly their role in ultimately reducing the effects of plague, so central to this story.
B000Y179KO|1.0|Okay, so my title and rating are harsh, but I really have found this double CD to be a MAJOR disappointment, especially in comparison to the band's impressive back catalogue.     Let me admit right from the outset that I've never been the Eagles number one fan, but I have always appreciated and semi-regularly enjoyed the pick of their work, mostly in the form of a single-CD \\"best of\\" that I bought some years back. What have I liked about this older material? In a nutshell, the clear strength of the songwriting, complete with instantly memorable melodies and evocative lyrics. What's missing from \\"Long Road Out of Eden\\"? In my opinion, precisely these two things (with the partial exception of the first single \\"How Long\\", which was suggestively written as far back as 1972, and not by any of the current line-up). No, for my money the quality of the melodies on offer here falls well, well below the standard set by the Eagles themselves all those years ago, and (at the risk of coming across as plain nasty) to my ear the lyrics sound generally contrived and forced, and specifically they are a mixture of juvenile (where the love-gone-wrong tracks are concerned), saccharine (where the more \\"positive\\" love songs are concerned), and pretentious and preachy (when the political themes shift to the foreground).    To be sure, the musicianship is professional, the production crisp, the harmonies sweet etc etc, but nothing can make up for the serious dearth of quality in the songwriting. The \\"old\\" Eagles made it all sound so effortless, but this sounds like they're trying hard - perhaps too hard - and failing to come up with the goods in the process.     In the end then, where the \\"Long Road\\" is concerned, I'm afraid that I'll soon be taking the \\"short road\\" to my local secondhand record store to trade it in, not because this album is so bad, but simply because I would literally NEVER EVER listen to it in preference to the Eagles' earlier material (this is part of the reason why Iopted to give this CD one star, and I'd probably give it two if I was judging it as a stand-alone release from a new band). I guess there's no shame in failing to live up to a legacy as fine as their's, but I still find it sad that, after more than a quarter of a century in the making (or at least in the waiting), with this effort they've fallen so far short of doing so. I know that many others (including numerous professional critics) feel that the Eagles are \\"soaring\\" once again with this album, but for me they've only succeeded in savagely \\"clipping their own wings\\".
B000JSI7AI|5.0|In this film everyone involved suffers. Wives and husbands. I felt sorry for Alma especially. She held in her sadness for so long until she exploded on Enis during a holiday dinner. Ennis was afraid of what would happen to him and Jack because of the story his father told him. Their affair was forbidden by society and Ennis knew it. Jack suffered because he was always being shunned out by Ennis. That's why he went to Mexico. Laureen was blind throughout the entire film until Ennis talked to her after Jack's passing and she put one and one together. Ennis was the character that had the most troubling conflict. He had trouble coming to terms with his relationship with Jack.  He despised Jack's crusing trips to Mexico. Ennis was loyal to his family and Jack. As for Jack, he was shunned by his father, an emotionless marriage, and his father in law. Something had to snap inside of him and that's was why he went to Mexico. Like I said everyone suffered in this film. It's sad, but in the end minus Jack everyone moved on with their lives. The film was well written and well acted. It will stand the test of time.

B000654YK6|5.0|What a great surprise. . . When you think you've heard, watched, read, or seen everything having to do with the greatest art form ever, grunge, something like Hype! comes along.  And it's like discovering Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Soundgarden, Alice In Chains, Temple of the Dog, Mad Season, Screaming Trees, Mudhoney, or L7, all over again.    And the Seattle scene is captured perfectly.

B000AMJC2K|4.0|I'm using this with the Samsung 226BW monitor (22\\") and I get the feeling this is about as big of a monitor as you can use with this mount.  I had to REALLY tighten the hex-nut right behind the monitor to get it not to fall forward.  Now anything more than a light touch will cause it to fall forward... so its not really \\"adjustable\\". However, I don't need to contantly adjust it, so it works for me.  For the price, I'd still buy this again since most other mounting arms are substantially more expensive.   Oh, I think the aesthetics are pretty nice as well.
B000UR9TQE|4.0|I was really excited when I heard about this reissue/remaster, especially the extra material and improvement of the audio. For 30 years this film has been a mixed blessing/curse of great live playing and poor film making, bad editing choices and worse wigs. The excellent DVD release of 2003 gave me hope and I thought JP and Co. would finally do it justice, by giving us more complete, less chopped up performances. While this reissue is nicely done, especially the remastered sound, I think it could have been so much better.  For example, the inclusion of additional songs is great but frustrating.   While it's great to finally see the omitted songs performed, the quick cut editing is so frequent that I feel like I'm watching a video produced for VH-1 rather than a concert performance. WTF!... Do they think that most people don't have the attention span to watch Jimmy Page actually play a solo from start to finish? I don't know, maybe garbage pop culture has changed the way we experience live music on film too much. I can understand filling in missing gaps with other footage but this is extreme.  There's a cut like every 1/2 second!  I think many of us also hoped that we might have the option of watching the actual performances rather than the fantasy sequences; the solos on No Quarter, Dazed and Moby Dick I could watch over and over but, as for for the fantasy sequences, once is enough! Legal reasons or whatever, alas, it was not to be. We still have to sit through lame acting and silly drama (except for Bonzo's unpretentious scenes). It always irks me that people talk so much about how great a band is/was and then they do a film to show how great the band is/was and then they don't just simply show the band playing! I disagree with the description on the insert...this is \\"not\\" the version fans have been waiting for. That version would be a Director's Cut with the concert footage only, in original performance order.  Ultimately, despite the old and new flaws, it's still nice to have the improved quality print and sound as well as the extras. I just hope that Jimmy goes into the vaults and gives us a real concert film someday, (like he did with Royal Albert Hall '70), sans t-shirt and postcards.
B000UFAURI|3.0|So much music, so little time... For old rockers like myself, Foo Fighters have both a familiar and refreshing sound. \\"The Pretender\\" will probably get the most air play from \\"Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace\\", and it is an excellent song. It got me to check out the album. However, my favorite cut is probably \\"Erase-Replace\\". It simply rocks! \\"Summer's End\\" is just as good.    Instrumental, \\"Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners\\", reminded me a bit of some classic Led Zeppelin tunes. The reminder of the cuts are all good, though none particularly stand out. Even if you are someone who rips the prime cuts from albums to make your own mixes, there's enough of them on here to make it worth your while.
B000VECAEO|5.0|If you love Seinfeld, Season 9, the last season, is a must in your video library. This set includes some of the best episodes.  It also includes a great behind the scenes of the last episode.
B00003CWPL|5.0|Eraserhead is a movie that's in a category all its own--nothing has been made like it since (and probably never will be). I agree with many other reviewers here; this film definitely benefits from multiple viewings and it gets better with each viewing. I think it's uncanny how much the opening scene showing Jack Nance and his embryonic \\"baby\\" floating in space reminds me of the closing scene in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY--the \\"star child\\" scene. All in all, a true surrealist masterpiece.
B00011F5DK|5.0|I collect board games and added this to my collection based on all the great reviews.  I was NOT disappointed.  The game is so easy to learn and every game is different, even if you play mulitiple times with the same people.  I was very skeptical based on the directions and game description I read online but sometimes it's the simple games that you want to play again and again.  The game dynamics can change with just one piece on the board and it's very fun formulating strategies.  Everyone we've introduced this game to loves it as much as we do and it always manages to make it's way out on game night.  The only drawback is you can't really play with more than 4 people and we don't like the game as much playing with 2 or 3 people.  It's really meant to play with 4 players.  That's the only drawback.  Otherwise, I really want to play as I'm typing this.  :)
B000E5KJD4|4.0|pretty good hd transfer, not the best, bust still has its moments that make you go wow thats nice. the audio on this movie seems a little quite i had to turn my volume way up, but overall its a great movie, great music, great to have on hd if you have a hd player
0375507256|1.0|Like many others here I bought this book based on awards and glowing reviews.  It has ended up being one of the worst books I have ever read.  I am listening to it on CD and the dialect of the narrator in the Hawaii section is sooooooooooo annoying that I've almost had several accidents while listening to it while driving.  The first couple of short stories were just ok, some funny parts, but the sci-fi Korean thing and now this Hawaiian guy who sounds like he from Canada, \\"Ya hey dere\\", are absolutely killing me.  I've reached that point though where I will not let this book defeat me.  I am going to listen to the bloody end and then maybe take a sledge hammer to the CDs.
B000U0F7RG|4.0|Okay folks,  since I didn't find any details -other than on amazon- about the DVD Set, I thought I'd write some down.  My set arrived yesterday!  Why I didn't write then you ask? Well, I didn't have enough money to pay for customs, so the post man didn't give it to me.    For those of you living in Germany: Be prepaired to pay 29,38EUR on arrival. IF you have bought your set off amazon for 160$. They actually add the shipping to the calculation basis. Yes, not as cheap as you wish.    Since I don't know how to add pictures here, let's try telling you what it looks like in writing:   The outer box is made of plastic, the inner box, holding the set DVDs is cardboard. The season sets are cardboard too.   There is a magnet inside the overlapping lashes of the outer box that closes it.  The episode guide as well as the gilmoreism book are paperback, no hardcover.    I have not had the time to search for any easter eggs, but I doubt there are any since everybody says the DVDs are exactly the same as in the set boxes. I wouldn't know, because I don't own the individual sets.  From the fancy episode guide thingy you get I can tell this much:    SEASON 1   Disk6 Bonus materials:  Welcome to the Gilmore Girls  -Series creator and cast describe how this family-favorite series evolved.-  Gilmore Goodies and Gossip - Rory's Dance  -On-Screen factoids-  Gilmore-Isms  -A look at many of the show's witty and memorable wordplays.-    (I remember that there was this \\"blooper wheel\\" on the Season 1 DVDs, but it is not listed in the ep guide. Does anybody remember if it was hidden somehow?)    SEASON 2  Disc 7  \\"Sadie, Sadie\\" - unaired scene  Disk 8  \\"Presenting Lorelai Gilmore\\" - unaired scene  Disk 10 \\"There's the rub\\" - unaired scene  Disk 12 \\"I can't get started\\" - unaired scene  Also on Disk 12  Bonus materials:  A Film By Kirk  International Success - How other countries welcome the girls  Gilmore Goodies & gossip - A-tisket, a-tasket  -On Screen factoids-  Who wants to argue?  -The season's best shouting matches-    SEASON 3  Disk 16 \\"Swan Song\\" - unaired scene  Disk 17 \\"Say Goodnight, Gracie\\" - unaired scene  Disk 18 \\"Those are strings, Pinocchio\\" - unaired scene  Also on Disk 18   Bonus materials:  All Grown Up  - Cast stories of childhood experiences-  Who wants to fall in love?  -The season's best romantic moments-  Our Favorite '80s  -Favorite dance moves-    SEASON 4  Disk 19 \\"Ballrooms & Biscotti\\" - unaired scene  Disk 22 \\"The reigning Lorelai\\" - unaired scene  Disk 24 Bonus materials:  Gilmore Goodies & Gossip   -Fun facts bonus version of \\"Girls in bikinis, boys doin' the twist\\"-  Who wants to get together?  -The season's most romantic moments-  Stars Hollow Challenge  -Trivia Quiz-    SEASON 5  Disk 26 \\"You jump, I jump, Jack\\" - Commentary by Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino  Disk 30 Bonus materials:  Gilmore Girls Turns 100  -Taking stock on reaching five years and 100 episodes-  Behind the scenes of the 100th episode  Who wants to talk Gilmore?  -The season's wittiest wordplay moments-    SEASON 6  -No Bonus-    SEASON 7  Disk 38 \\"The great stink\\" - unaired scene  Disk 42 Bonus materials:  Gilmore Fashionistas  A Best friend's peek inside the Gilmore Girls with Keiko Agena  Who wants to talk boys?  -The season's best boys montage-  Season Montage  Kirk's tour of Stars Hollow    So all in all you get what everybody else already owns plus a cute box that does not fit on your DVD shelf with the other DVDs since it's way larger though.  I am glad I bought it but for those of you who already own the DVD sets... don't bother. Just like my fellow reviewers already told you: There's nothing new.  Still, I'm glad to have it and I give this box 4 stars.   It would have gotten 5 if there had been any additional extras.
B0000028M7|1.0|I bought this to give it a listen. To me it is horrible. Described by some as dreary and droopy, it sure is. Once was enough, it is off to the used cd store. A whole generation, if you will, grew up on this sorry state of music pushed by the record companies. At least I gave it a go. There is alot of other good music not so \\"popular\\".
B0000AVF29|5.0|What a great album.  Eric has re-invented himself. The title says it all. Eric goes thru a total transformation here, no longer the screamin Geordie, but a more introspective Eric. He's letting the music speak for him.  This album was put out in 1967, right around the time of Sgt. Peppers.  Eric could have shelved it in fear like Brian Wilson did with the Beach Boys newest album, but this album is just as good as Sgt. More into psychodelia, but still mixed in with some blues, Gregorian chant, and a rousing tribute to his new close friend ,Jimi Hendrix.  He gives tributes to his musical idols, and at the same time introduces us to some very impressive new visions.  Check out Man Woman, and tell me this guy cant sing all types of music in one album, and pull it off perfectly.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|This is a new classic and I'm happy to have it.  Seller was excellent to deal with.
B000EMGJM2|5.0|CD was like brand new! Not a scratch! I would highly recommend this seller's merchandise.
B000QEIOTO|5.0|While this was an outstanding movie, it is not quite as good as the second one. But then the second one isn't as good as the third one. The video and sound on this one are excellent in HD and should impress. This is the series that made James Bond get a facelift. A must buy for HD DVD owners.
0061122416|5.0|Quite honestly, one of the best books I have ever read. Being a writer, I have tendencies to carry books everywhere I go, especially those stories with powerful messages and notable passages; this one hasn't left my side in many years.    The story is simple, the characters are easily understood and the adversity and emotional struggles of the protagonist, Santiago, are common to most people. The overall theme within the story is the quest to determine why we (or in this case, the protagonist Santiago) are here. Paul Coelho emphasizes through his stories a common theme and passion for encouraging people to listen to their inner voice, stay in tune with their spiritual essence and believe wholeheartedly in the pursuit of personal ambitions and dreams, understanding that in doing so, we become more in tune with our true identity. There is a firm distinction between chasing the types of dreams that might bring us riches, but instead the wealth of peace that comes with knowing you are fulfilling a purpose--your purpose--within this world.    Santiago, the Andalusian shepherd boy, faces a series of worldly tests, those many of us will face through the course of our life as we move towards pursuing a lifelong dream--even those we are unaware of at the time. He is comfortable and complacent within his world of simplistic routine and secure within his bond with his sheep; they are his livelihood and they are his companions. As the story unfolds our hero becomes intertwined and confused, struggling to come to terms with his purpose and justification for why he would ever pursue a foolish idea of \\"riches\\", all foretold within a dream and interpreted by a gypsy. As described by Coelho within a special preface, our hero will come to terms with four major obstacles--doubt, love, the fear of defeat and finally guilt in accepting the notion that we may be special enough to obtain a goal, knowing others fell short along their own personal journeys.  From a reading perspective, thisstory is amazing and eye-opening and a truly pleasurable tale of self-evaluation. From a writer's perspective, it has to be one of the most fundamentally sound and simplistic stories I have ever read, all told within a world of beautiful imagery, spiritual enlightenment and earnest passions to conquer the world, all in the name of love.
B000E1MTXQ|5.0|Better than the original is something not too many series can do. This one does so pick it up along with the other two today on HD DVD.
B00005JPS9|3.0|The animation worked some of the time. The yelling seemed 300 like but not as good. I wished Angelina had more time in the film. Entertaining enough but not as good as other films in the genre. Warning Angelina is only in the move for about 5 min!
0765357151|5.0|I read a lot of end of the world books and this is one of the best. It's not a vampire novel as much as a story of a man alone in the world. The ending is rather abrupt but that may be because I couldn't put it down and read it so quickly. Many of the other short stories in this version are also good reads. However, they also have some abrupt endings.
1580176941|5.0|The detail that goes into each part of making these beautiful cookies is impressive: selected the recipe, rolling and cutting, baking, decorating. The timing is perfect for the holidays this year, but as other reviewers have pointed out, there are wonderful ideas for the whole year. Plus it's great that the authors always encourage you to come up with your own personal cookie ideas. Thanks!
0156030306|5.0|One of the most heart breaking, and moving novels I've ever read. It describes an almost inverse relationship between happiness and intelligence through the eyes of the protagonist. The \\"journal\\" style can be difficult to read at first, but it quickly gets easier and the change in writing style helps immerse you in the story. I can't recommend this book enough.
B000F7CMRM|5.0|I watched this film twice in two days, because it so resonated with information I had already discovered in researching issues of the Middle East.  The history of squandered opportunities in the late 20th century for peace has already been documented elsewhere, and the film was consistent and realistic in its portrayal of that.  As well, Clooney and the writers did an excellent job of highlighting the trail of misfortune and tragedy that gives rise to extremism.  It is an unbiased and realistic look at a spiraling conflict with few easy answers.  Watching it with an informed, non-prejudicial frame of mind will be rewarding and stimulating...and sobering.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|I haven't come across a mellow drama that impressed me in a while, though I do tend to avoid the more \\"girly\\" dramas anyway.  While this movie had an obvious feminine appeal, it is by no means strictly a \\"chick flick\\".  This is a movie just about anyone can enjoy, and even makes for a good date movie.  Will Ferrel puts forth a spectacular performance as events unfold along an excellent plot line.  The theme is also intriguing, though I'm deliberately avoiding details so you can get the full enjoyment of the flick.  I watched it having no idea what the movie was about, and I give it a 100% grade.

0525950079|5.0|I have nothing but fantastic things to say about \\"World Without End\\" by Ken Follett. The story nominally is the sequel to Follett's \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" but in reality it's a novel that can be read and appreciated on its own merits.    This tale lacks the focus of the first novel, which was obsessed with the building of the great cathedral at Kingsbridge -- the climax of the novel and all of its surrounding drama centered on it. Although additional construction efforts play prominent roles in this novel, the 14th century residents in this setting pretty much take the cathedral and its commercial and spiritual legacies for granted.     What it does share with the previous novel is an intriguing web of interrelated character development studies, spanning the religious, royal, serf and workman ranks. The intertwining of the lives of these people -- and thanks to Follett they really BECOME people -- against the historical backdrop of European history, particularly the devastation of the plague -- is what makes this tale truly great.    The novel also has many threads that only come to their heady conclusion at the end of the novel. I find this attention to detail very effective as it keeps the reader on-edge and that's crucial for a 1000 page book.    I guess I am surprised I liked the series -- I am not particularly knowledgeable about architecture, I am not Christian, so I was new to the structural terms referred to in the cathedral. The 11th - 14th centuries in England, while familiar, aren't my favorite epoch in history. And yet I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of \\"meeting\\", \\"getting to know\\" and watching these characters grow. I experienced their ups and downs as my own and that's the mark of a great novel.     Follett's pyschological insights into the human mind are largely right on-target and he really grasps the dynamics of human interaction in all of life's fields.    I highly recommend the series to readers who need their \\"historical fiction\\" fix, enjoy epochs and/or need an escape during a long break.
1572814136|5.0|The cards were in perfect condition upon arrival.  The packing was nice and tight so as not to dent the cards.  I am more than completely satisfied!!!!
8489367116|5.0|What more can be said that hasn't been said from other reviewers? This book is an excellent read. It's got a little bit of everything - intrigue, adventure, love, war - it's tough to put down! One thing that reall intrigued me about this book was its commentary on the Indian culture and traditions. The book's story line is interesting enough - the fact that I could learn about a culture I didn't know much about was a bonus! Another great thing about this book is that it doesn't get overly deep - a very down to earth story line.     Enjoy it!
B000Y179KO|3.0|Perhaps the most anticipated album release in years, I found it to be extremely disappointing. This is, truly, one of the better bands of my generation but after waiting 28 years for this banal album, rankles me. The price is excellent so that's not the part that bothers me. What DOES bother me is that there isn't a \\"Hotel California\\", \\"Desperado\\", \\"Life in the Fast Lane\\", \\"Victim of Love, \\"Best of My Love\\", \\"Already Gone\\", \\"I Can't Tell You Why\\" or even a \\"Those Shoes\\". If you're looking for that sort of creative effort, as I was, you're going to be severely disappointed. Originally, this album, as a single disc I suppose, was to have been released in the summer of 2003. Apparently, legal issues with Don Felder got in the way.    With all that said, let's get to the album itself. I've never been a Joe Walsh fan but his becoming a member led to some great creative juices flowing in the band. When Joe Walsh only pens one tune (he's never wrote that much that the Eagles have recorded) & it's the best song on there, you should know that this album has some serious weaknesses. That song is \\"Last Good Time in Town\\". Upon first listening to any new release, I look for songs that jump out to me. For a double CD there is little that did that. The songs that even did it a little bit are \\"Waiting in the Weeds\\" (love that minor key stuff), \\"Fast Company\\" (very funky), \\"Long Road Out of Eden\\" (a little weak lyrically) & \\"Frail Grasp on the Big Picture\\" (sounds like a Henley solo effort). Five songs, from a total of twenty, isn't a good percentage.    The Eagles had previously released Hotel California & The Long Run, both are among my favorite albums. This one never will be. Proceed at your own risk, some will like it & some won't; the reviews reflect this.
B000W1V5VU|5.0|A group of great actors involved in a great plot. A must see for all fans of this series.
B00006GA4C|4.0|This album was certainly a pinnacle of sorts for Grand Funk; it's energetic, raw, &, perhaps, one of their more consistent albums. This power trio never got the respect they were due except for the generation that grew up with them. This was their second studio album & it peaked at #11 on the album charts. The only single from the album to chart was \\"Mr. Limousine Driver\\", it barely made the Top 100 peaking at #97.<br /><br />The album opens with on of Grand Funk's best songs, \\"Got This Thing on the Move\\", one of their best rockers with a driving bass line, the song fizzles a little toward the end but still great. \\"Please Don't Worry\\" is only average. \\"High Falootin' Woman\\" is all right, it's typical Funk boogie rock. It;s hard to believe that \\"Mr. Limousine Driver\\" was released as a single, it's easily the weakest song on the album. \\"In Need\\" is next & completely refocuses the album back to the opening potential of the first song. \\"In Need\\" is one of their very best songs & they really stretch it out. It features some more riffs from Schacter who never got the credit he deserved. Farner shines once again on harmonica which most people don't talk about much, it might've been his strongest instrument. \\"Winter and My Soul\\" slows it down a little but isn't a bad song. \\"Paranoid\\" opens with voices, an air raid siren & a baby crying before getting into the actual song. This was one of their better songs. The original album closed with the incredible \\"Inside - Lookin' Out\\", arguably the best song in their repertoire. The Animals were the first to record this song; this is one of those few times that the cover version was an improvement.<br /><br />The album has two bonus tracks: the demo version of \\"Nothing Is the Same\\" which would be on their next studio album & an extended version of \\"Mr. Limousine Driver\\". These are okay but there's nothing revelatory. For Grand Funk fans this is one of the three albums to get, the other two being E Pluribus Funk & We're an American Band. Grand Funk is so raw & powerful, it's hard to ignore them. But if you listen carefully you can tell that they weren't a tight group but, of course, bands in those days didn't have much time to record. This album, along with just about all their contemporaries, was typically recorded in about a week. So mistakes, many times, were left in the final product. B ut that's okay, too, they represented a lot of the views of young Americans at that time in history. They were a blue collar band & they worked long & hard in order to become successful. I still enjoy their music.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|NCIS is one of the best shows to hit tv in a long time. If you don't watch this show you are missing out big time. The DVD's give you lots of cool extras, and the shows are shown in widescreen, which a lot of people are doing now. A must see.
B00005S6K8|5.0|As one of those guys who admits to actually liking \\"Chick Flicks\\", the 1995 remake of \\"Sabrina\\", starring Harrison Ford, ranks as one of my favorites.<br /><br />In both the 1999 and 1954 releases of Sabrina, we have a no nonsense business tycoon, Linus Larrabee (Harrison Ford / Humphrey Borgart) who works tirelessly and ruthlessly to ensure nothing ever gets in the way of the growth of his business empire.  Linus learns of a developing affair between his irresponsible playboy brother David Larrabee (Greg Kinnear / William Holden) and the chauffeur's daughter (Julia Ormond / Audrey Hepburn).  Fearing the situation could interfere with his business plans, since David is engaged to the daughter of his business partner, Linus injects himself into the situation, with the intention of enticing Sabrina away from his brother.  His plan is to quietly entice her to Paris, from which she had recently arrived after a long absence - and then leave her there - making sure she would be comfortable and happy there, but no longer able to unwittingly interfere with his business plans.<br /><br />Of course, Sabrina is not the immature, impressionable young woman Linus expects, and he is soon caught in a web of his own making.<br /><br />The two versions of this story are vastly different in the details - in the 1954 release, Sabrina goes to cooking school in France.  In the 1995 version, Sabrina is an intern working at a high end fashion magazine.  Travel to Paris in the 1954 version is via ship, but is via the Concorde in the 1995 film.  It is very interesting seeing how cultural attitudes, particularly the role of women in society, changed in the course of the 40 or so years between the two releases.<br /><br />I saw the 1995 version first, then went back and rented the original.  Of the two, I found the 1995 version to be much more interesting and fun to watch.  (On the other hand, my parents, who saw the original version in its initial theatrical release, have the opposite opinion!)<br /><br />The supporting cast is great, delivering some of the best lines in the script - usually as very dry humor, often hysterically funny: Richard Crenna and Angie Dickenson deliver superb performances as the mother and father of David Larrabee's Fiance'.  The wonderful Nancy Marchand, in one of her last film roles, is perfect as the mother of Linus and David; and Dana Ivey delivers some really memorable zingers in her role as Linus's executive assistant.<br /><br />All in all, a sweet, movie sprinkled with witty, dry humor and a few hysterical sight gags: a good choice for a quiet evening in front of the TV with your significant other.<br /><br />If you like Sabrina, take a look at [[ASIN:B000LXHK2C A Good Year (Widescreen Edition)]] starring Russell Crowe - though not quite on the same level as this film, it is a very similar sweet and funny story that is well worth watching.reat, delivering some of the best lines in the script - usually as very dry humor, often hysterically funny: Richard Crenna and Angie Dickenson deliver superb performances as the mother and father of David Larrabee's Fiance'.

B000V6BE6C|5.0|Where can I possibly start? I love heavy metal and hard rock. What I don't love is stupid loud screaming in agony. That's why I love Kamelot (check em out!) That's also why I like this album. I'm not a diehard A7X fan - I'd only listened to City of Evil before listening to this. I like the coupling of hard, fast music and, while loud and potentially yelling, somewhat \\"clean\\" vocals. It's obvious that Shadows is no Josh Groban, yet his voice is so engulfing that it draws you in. He treads the line between singing and screaming, which is a very fine line indeed. That's why I love this album. The songs are catchy, sing-along-ish, and smart (save for a couple...). Other reviewers are looking at this album through their old-school fan eyes (which isn't bad-it's the only way they can). I view this CD from the vantage of a relative newcomer. As such, I am probably more inclined to enjoy this than others. Maybe that was A7X's point. They probably want to draw new fans in. They just have to be careful not to alienate their old ones.  I'm going to give a quick review of the song list below:    \\"Critical Acclaim\\" - It is so refreshing to hear a conservative viewpoint about the war in popular music today. No, I don't support the war effort. But I still appreciate and respect what those brave men are doing over there. This song merely gives a shout-out (quite literally!) to those soldiers. Oh, and by the way, it's a good song. (4/5)    \\"Almost Easy\\" - Like others have stated, the first time I heard this, I was about the opposite of blown away. But after listening to it over and over again, it really does grow on you. Any song about insanity is good, right? (3.5/5)    \\"Scream\\" - A pretty weak offering to be sure, but nonetheless catchy. Lyrics are nothing to go crazy over, but I do like the lines \\"Scream, scream, scream, the way you would if I ravaged your body/your mind!\\" He he he. (3/5)    \\"Afterlife\\" - Another ultimately forgettable song. Nice, catchy, not without its good points...but still forgettable. (3/5)    \\"Gunslinger\\" - This one I love. It's got the same old western feel as the opening to \\"Strength Of The World\\" did on City Of Evil. Starts out slow, picks up into full metal mode later on. A smart offering on their part. (4/5)    \\"Unbound (The Wild Ride)\\" - Very nice mic-straining yelling on this one. One of my favorites. (5/5)    \\"Brompton Cocktail\\" - Again, a very nice job on the vocals. I always love when they go for the loud, bombastic style of singing, instead of barking out nonsense. (5/5)    \\"Lost\\" - I know everyone is putting this song down for it's super-pop attitude and use of strange digital synth vocals. I love it for these aspects. It's unique, it's different, it's unexpected. (4/5)    \\"A Little Piece Of Heaven\\" - Yes, we all know it's weird. It's also a very good step in Broadway's direction. Very stagey and carnival-esque. Neat. (3.75/5)    \\"Dear God\\" - A country outing that is surprisingly good in my mind. Again, unique and inspiring. (4/5)    Overall, this album is a great step for A7X's new melodic style. It's rare to find a CD where every single song is good and you can listen to the whole thing without skipping anything. Thankfully, Avenged Sevenfold have done it.
B000VK99Z6|4.0|This was actually a pretty funny movie, and definitely a \\"rentable\\" title.  The story was fairly original, the acting decent, and both my wife and I found ourselves laughing out loud.  I wouldn't actually go to the trouble of owning this one, but it was a great Tivo rental for a Sunday afternoon.
1416523359|2.0|I'm a fan of old King from the 80's, but he's really gone overboard with this new book.  Good writing doesn't mean you can tell a good story.  There were a few fleeting moments of suspense, but for the most part, it's just nonstop rambling for hundreds of pages.  I didn't like any of the characters in this and thought it was terribly overwritten.  It takes him entire paragraphs to describe the most ordinary of acts, and by the time he finishes, all tension has fizzled into nothingness.  I can only assume he keeps selling books because of public loyality.  The fact that this won the Bram Stoker award last year for best novel tells me people voted for him by default, not having read the other finalists.  It's a shame, and frankly, embarrassing.  Don't waste your time with this stinker.
0765357151|3.0|\\"I Am Legend\\" is the riveting psychological thriller about someone who might be the last man on earth.  Robert Neville is the only person he knows that is not infected with or dead from a epidemic that turns ordinary people into bloodthirsty monsters.  The ultimate survivalist, Neville spends his days preparing for the nightly attacks by his former neighbors and others who not only want him dead; they want to drink his blood.  Neville not only has the stress of fighting for his life, but he also must deal with the internal problems of living with loneliness with no end in sight.  Are there others who were immune to the plague?  Will he find them?  Should he go in search of them?  Richard Matheson delves deep into the mind of the ultimate outsider in this amazing work of fiction.<br /><br />\\" I Am Legend\\" is just one of the stories in this multistory volume.  The rest of the stories range from pointless three page stories that make you wonder why you bothered even opening the book to riveting short stories that could be episodes from \\"The Twilight Zone\\", which Matheson wrote tele-plays for.  All told even though \\"I Am Legend\\" deserves a 5 star rating as a short novel, the some of the other stories drag this volume down to a 3.5.
044661758X|5.0|Connelly's previous books were of the kind that is hard to put down, but this novel is even better. The author delivers a work that combines an in-depth look at the main character, with an investigation and a trial with many clever twists. At this point I am definitely a fan of the series, and something really odd will have to happen in the future to change this fact.<br /><br />The novel starts with a bang, narrating the events of four years ago, in which Harry Bosch killed a man accused of being a serial killer, known as the Dollmaker. In the present time, the wife of the supposed killer is suing Bosch and the department for wrongful dead. When the detective gets a letter that resembles the ones the Dollmaker used to send and another body surfaces, matters become quite complicated. Did Harry Bosch kill the right man? Is the killer still at large or are the current events the work of a copy cat?<br /><br />One of the main things that Connelly excels at in this book is in introducing some well-crafted characters, in particular the attorney for the plaintiff. This woman is so ruthless and cut-throat that there are times at which I felt like ripping the pages of the book just to get to her! Another very interesting element that the author introduced is a romantic relationship that started in the previous installment, as a casual one, and that now is taking a whole different color. This adds variety to the story and helps give the character of Bosch an additional dimension that makes him more real to the reader. This third novel in the series is a clear winner; I hope the quality stays at this high a level.

B000W4KT6E|4.0|The '07 release `Hairspray' is not exactly my usual viewing faire but I must admit it turned out to be a pleasant surprise. The song and dance numbers are energetic and infectious, the dialogue clever and at times risky and stellar performances abound. I was initially quite shocked to see John Travolta playing the part of an overweight, middle-aged woman, but he pulled it off to perfection. I definitely have a new respect for the man, taking on a role like this could have been a disaster. Matching him with the always off-the-way Christopher Walken was pure genius.<br /><br />My Rating: Primarily geared to teens but can be enjoyed by all, -4 Stars-.
0525950079|5.0|Wonderful insight into the way people really are and how they have acted for centuries...Only Walter Mosley has the skills to match Follett...Never wanted this book to end...can't wait for the next 15 in the series....

B000XKZQ74|5.0|An amazing and very touching film. Sadly the Unbox version I rented was sub-par - every minute or so I noticed shaky frames that were clearly messed up in the transfer to the Unbox format.     The film deserves much better.
B000OW8DW6|2.0|I didn't think this movie was that great. I was looking foward to seeing Julianne Moore but she leaves pretty early into it. and the end was kind of a let down.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|This is by far the greatest Gary Cooper movie and for that matter the greatest movie ever made.  The Special Edition DVD is also the greatest of all dvd's on Gary Cooper ever done.  This movie is the number 1 dvd selling movie on Amazon for Gary Cooper films, Number one for best selling for Howard Hawks and number 2 for best selling war movies of all time even outselling movies like Flags of our Fathers and Patton.  It was at number 2 for best selling Gary Cooper movies ever since it was released but in the last two weeks it has been outselling even High Noon.  This will not last for long though as Amazon has raised the price on it from 19.99 to 24.99 giving customers only a 1.99 savings.  I guess the powers that be could not stand seeing this movie at the top of all the best seller listings on amazon and decided to boost the price to almost the list price.  This is beyond a 5 star movie and certainly a 5 star dvd presentation of the movie.  WB deserves a 5 star ranking for giving this movie a 2 disc SE treatment that it deserves.
B000VBJEEG|3.0|We love this movie, it's the shipping we have issues with... we received the  box all bent and smashed and then the 2 movie cases inside were all bent inside as well... certainly not in any shape to give as gifts... fortunately the movie still played OK to spite how bad the case was smashed and bent. Maybe the movies should be sent in movie mailers, not regular boxes that are easily smashed and bent.

B000VDDDY6|5.0|I first starting watching Star Trek TOS back in the 1970s right after school.  I still remember watching it at 4PM on CTV, and I thought it was amazing.  The monsters were scary, the stories were great, the effects were amazing.  Then over the years came new shows with better effects, and even better effects and Star Trek started to look old, then it started to look silly.  I guess with TNG, VOY, DS9 and Enterprise TOS became really dated.    I didn't pre-buy this title because that was my opinion of TOS, old.  Then one day I saw this on display in a store playing in HD and I was amazed.  It looked great.  The content is cleaned up, the effects are current gen, but unlike what George did to Star Wars the effects have been updated but NOT enhanced to show off what you can do with CGI.  So the effects do not take over from the great stories, but effects are not dated and they no longer distract you, they're seamless and current.    So I picked up these discs and now am watching Space Seed in HD and it has honestly never looked better to me.  This is just like the 10 year old me watching the show back in the 1970s all over again.  I will pickup season two when it is released, because this is honestly a great show.    Well worth the price.
1577314808|5.0|This is a wonderful guide for living mindfully.  The only other work that I have enjoyed as much is Free Your Mind by Sensei Anthony Stultz.[[ASIN:0595419534 Free Your Mind: The Four Directions of an Awakened Life]]  The Power of Now is a clear and practical guide for finding ease.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This is such a heartwarming story. The soundtrack really compliments the story... The colours are just AMAZING. Even if the story doesn't engage you as much as you would want it to, the vivid colours and beautiful artwork will keep you watching! :)

B000E1YVZU|5.0|When I saw the original cast of Rent on Broadway I was not wowed. Then when I saw the film version, I started crying at the opening scene. Really well done.
B000VL9XNI|4.0|Most fans of AC/DC will have most of this footage and the complete concerts. However, it is cleaned up slightly and is a nice to have. The best part for me is the 3rd disk as I wanted the FOTS concert. It is not the full concert, but it is a good chunk of it. Never the less many fans may already have that concert, but I did not.
B000002ITW|5.0|So, I am too young to have been there for this.  LOL I wasn't even born yet.  I am all right with that.  I grew up listening to this on vinyl.  I get into live albums mainly because you get to hear what the artists REALLY sound like, no (or not many anyway) studio tricks.  These guys are the standard to which all others should strive to harmonize to.  Awesome album, awesome group, awesome sound.  It's worth buying if you're into songs like Ohio, Southern Man, or any song CSN&Y ever wrote.  This is an absolute MUST OWN for anyone into music.  It doesn't disappoint.
B000VWYNNW|4.0|This cd remixed and remastered sounds like it was recorded yesterday.  I saw them live two nights in a row Feb. 14, 15 1975 on Long Island N. Y. and each night they did not play the songs the same. I love the feel of the new CD. The old CD has its own magic and sounds good, better that the old days on LP. Enjoy the fact that they are still working on remixing and remastering there work.
B0000VD04M|5.0|Johnny Depp loves to take the off-beat campy roles and he picked the cream of the crop with \\"Ed Wood!\\"  Weird, funny, campy, well-acted and just downright goofy at times, it's totally enjoyable for people who like something a little on the dark side.  One of my favorite Depp flicks.
B000IONJH4|4.0|I bought a copy on VHS of the movie when it first came out years ago before DVD's and my copy is 4hrs. Why cant they offer a DVD version now? I like the 4 hr. version. The first time I saw the new one, I noticed all the missing parts and wondered what happend to it. Just wasn't the same movie.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Good product - good shipping.  I love this movie - my new all time favorite.
B000002LQR|5.0|I'm not going to get into too much detail about all the many qualities of this album, because I think many of the other reviewers have probably said it better than I could.  But I will say that this album isn't only in my Top 5 desert island picks, but it occupies the coveted #1 spot.  And this is from someone who thinks music is the ultimate life force and owns hundereds of CD's, many of them count among history's greatest recordings.  But BSSM speaks to me somehow.  Its raw, yet refined.  Playful and funky, yet full of aggression and energy.      As much as I love Hillel Slovak on Uplift Mofo Party Plan, I must say - the Chili Peppers without John Frusciante just aren't the same band.  I even have a lot of respect for Dave Navarro both as a guitarist and an innovator of alternative rock...but the RHCP albums that Frusciante played on- Mother's Milk, BSSM, Californication, By the Way, and most recently Stadium Arcadium are all something special.  BSSM and Californication will forever be the albums that first defined the band, and then pulled them out of certain self-destruction.  Both masterpieces.  There's really not a bad song on this record.
B000HEWEE4|3.0|Fast shipping-good product.  Not as good as I thought it would be.  It was ok though.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|Even though Gilmore Girls was snubbed by the Emmys this year, and even though they rarely won in popular award categories, they did pull in a large number of awards/nominations, and rightfully so.  Now Time magazine has Gilmore Girls on their 100 greatest tv shows of all time - and rightfully so.<br /><br />  For those who have never seen the show, the excellent reviews here are right on the money.  Unfortunately, for the first few seasons, I only caught an episode here and there.  I started watching regularly in what turned out to be the last season.  Now I watch the show religiously... and I force others to watch as well.  There isn't an episode you wouldn't like, not a character that should be written off, not one line that doesn't fit perfectly, not one show where you don't walk away with something that can help you somewhere in life.<br /><br />  It's not just a \\"girl show\\".  It's about love and life and family and what really matters most in life.  It shows how humor can be used to deal with even the most stressful situations in life, even when you don't have a fairy-tale life or happy ending.<br /><br />  I'm not sure what the fuss is about the Barbie-doll packaging.  It might not be the perfect choice, but I wouldn't care if the set came in a wrapper from a tuna sandwich.  I'd be proud to have this outstanding series on my shelf.<br /><br />  Much appreciation to the creators and actors of this outstanding series.  You've given us something to treasure for a long time to come!  Sorry to see you go.
0061148512|1.0|For most of my adult life (I am 49) people who get to know me tell me that I would absolutely love this book.  I finally got round to reading it recently.  What a disappointment.  What is it all about?  She repeats herself several times and I don't understand what it means at all.  Shame.
B000PKG7TI|5.0|It was definitely an \\"End of a Era\\" with the loss of Tarja Turunen but it is not the end of Nightwish! It is easy for me to say the Tuomas Holopainen is one of the best if not the best new composers of our time. The music envelopes all of your senses and at time touches your soul, and when you add Emppu(guitar), Jukka(drums) and Marco(base)who are all masters of thier craft they help breath life into Holopainen's visions.  It is very sad that this is the Final performance for Tarja but it is defiantly one to revisit again and again. Thank you Tarja for this fantastic show and we will miss you! \\"STUNNING\\" \\"Exquisite\\" and well worth your investment. May all our \\"Nightwishes\\" come true.
B000PFU7OO|4.0|This was one of the best movies I've seen in years, and the soundtrack is pretty good too!
0061150142|2.0|This book entertained me - I won't lie.  I read through it quickly and wanted to find out what happened in the end.  But then, I was thoroughly disappointed. Without spoiling the ending for others, the book is completely implausable.  Chris' explanation of what happened the night his girlfriend died is absolutely ridiculous.  Further, the jury's finding, at the end of the case, is highly unlikely.<br /><br />This is the second Jodi Piccault book I have read - I read Vanishing Acts too - and I preferred Vanishing Acts because at least, the story was logical.  I don't think I would pick up another Jodi Piccoult book, however, because she isn't a great writer.
B000UR366S|3.0|As a HUGE Joni fan since the very beginning, this was a bit of a disappointment- especially after so much anticipation.  But since her music is always worthy of multiple listenings, I won't really be able to make a judgement for some time.  However, I don't hear anything particularly catchy or memorable so far.
B000XA5K48|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It's entertaining, funny and full of action (and gore :D). I liked Clive Owen in Sin City (King Arthur-not so much) and he was the perfect choice for \\"Smith\\". Monica Bellucci was a pleasant surprise because she's not the typical skinny helpless damsel in distress. And they had some chemistry. I've only seen Paul Giamatti in Man on the Moon but he was a fantastic villain in this movie.<br />You really can't take this movie too seriously or you're going to hate it.
0812974611|3.0|This is a decent enough historical potboiler, though. The writing is lively and pulls the reader along, and the expository dialog is reasonably well crafted. The engineering accounts of the aqueducts are either fascinating or boring, depending on your bent (I found them fascinating). The account of the eruption fits well with contemporary accounts and excavated evidence. Overall I enjoyed it for what it was. If you're looking for \\"War and Peace\\", go buy that instead. But if you'd like to imagine what it must have been like to live through this event, this is pretty good.
055358894X|5.0|It has been a long time since I \\"escaped\\" into a novel.  Locke Lamora is a fun character... and there isn't a wasted word in the entire novel.       Mr. Lynch did a tremendous amount of rewriting and editing.  I don't want to spoil anything, but everything you read about no matter how minor becomes important later on.     What a tremendous endeavor to undertake and it all slowly builds to a very satisyfing and believable conclusion.       I cant imagine how much work went into this, but great gob Scott and good luck!       Great job.
B000NA28A2|5.0|A wonderful, wonderful CD. Just look at all the 5-Star ratings! Each and every one of them is right!<br /><br />I too say \\"FIVE STARS!\\" and \\"BRAVO!\\" But I do have, for want of a better word, a \\"complaint.\\" The CD is only 40-some minutes long!<br /><br />And so, the sumptuous experience of listening... is over too soon!<br /><br />There is, happily, a solution: Put your CD player on REPEAT. I'm also off to explore more Juan Luis Guerra. Any suggestions? : )<br /><br />Kirtland Peterson
B00026WU82|5.0|just buy it. it is worth it. the first song is worth the cost of the entire album. you almost forget to listen the rest cause you just keep repeating the first song. then you hear the rest and you just have to sit down or pull off to the side of the road so you can reclaim your mind.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|If you're not stymied by subtitles, this is a superb look into the dark crevices of government run amok, and the slow awakening to his own humanity of one of its more stalwart protectors (and defenders). Wonderful character development, exceptional acting, a plot that builds slowly and terrifyingly to an eloquent, yet tragic conclusion. Not recommended for those lacking an appreciation of subtlety.
B00026WU9Q|4.0|this is a good one. not the best but really an essential. I'd get Highway 61 Revisited first, the probably Bob Dylan self entitled. It is his first one.  but this album is good.
0525950079|4.0|World Without End.  Book without End is more like it - 1,000+ pages of 14th century life in the fictional town of Kingsbridge, with a focus on 4 main characters whose lives are tied together by chance when they are children and save the life of a knight in the nearby forest.  The mysterious knight swears one of the main characters to secrecy when they bury a document together, to be opened only in the event of the knight's death.  Brothers Merthin (the knight's accomplice) and Ralph find themselves on diverging paths as Merthin pursues a career as a builder and Ralph (the sadistic little bastard) embarks on a knight's path but cannot live happily without inflicting cruelty on most people he meets. Two girls, Gwenda (whose father encourages her to steal and who later sells her as a slave) and Caris, a young woman of upwardly mobile merchant background, find lifelong friendship but totally different life stories.  Much of the story centers around the town Priory, which is ruled at first by a kindly monk, but whose death leaves the monks to be led by the very ambitious and often unscrupulous Brother Godwyn.  The knight in the initial episode also becomes a monk, and Brother Thomas is a helpful figure to the four children as grownups as the years go by. There is much detail on bridge and cathedral building, and the machinations of aldermen, townsfolk, and monks lend those details lots of life. The Black Death visits more than once, and makes heroes and cowards evident.  For the most part, the book reads quite modernly, with an emphasis on the love and sexual affairs of its characters. Caris and Merthin are star-crossed and kept apart by various circumstances, as Caris becomes anachronistically feminist, then joins the convent as a wise woman versed in natural medical care; and as the frustrated Merthin finds his fortune in Italy. Ralph becomes a prominent citizen, but only at the expense of his soul; he rapes, pillages, and murders to suit his immediate needs. The unfortunate Gwenda follows her heart and wins the man she loves, but makes some choices that haunt her forever.  The book covers the years between 1327 and 1361, and period detail is pretty good, especially in regard to conventional medical beliefs and building techniques.  A problem for other reviewers and for me is a male writer's problem, I think.  One of the characters is raped, and finds herself  (\\"almost against her will\\") responding to the event with some sexual pleasure. OK, once, maybe; I know there are documented cases where the victim does respond. But it happens twice!  Ridiculous. Leaving that aside, though, the book reads like an adventure, with plenty of intrigue and human drama to keep one turning the pages
0060007737|4.0|I really found this book to be useful on many levels.  It's easy to read, and you can immediately find uses for the ideas here.  Some of the information about specific products is outdated, so I'd like to hear what the author would say about huge emerging brands over the past few years.<br /><br />I'd love to see a study examining Microsoft's Zune marketing strategies to go up against the iPod, what went wrong, and could still go right.  Going up against the iPod is quite the challenge.<br /><br />I used the \\"category definition\\" information immediately.  \\"Promote the category if you are first, not just the product.\\"  Great stuff!
B000002G8J|3.0|When I started listening to Clapton, I bought every record from the 70's and 80's with the exception of this one, which at the time I was unable to find in any store. So, when I saw it in the Amazon promotions, I didn't hesitate in buying it. In resume, it's definitly not one of his best records but it also isn't one of the worst. It's easy to listen and has some well constructed songs. I wouldn't recommend it to a casual Clapton listener, but if you're an admirer then it surely is a nice item to add your collection.
1591391105|4.0|Nothing earth-shattering, but a great book that helps you focus on what you need to do to succeed in your new job -- things to think about, things to do, thinks to be weary of, and thinks not to do. A great guide to motivate you to develop a plan, rather than hapharzadly start your new job.
B00005QDW5|5.0|The CDs came in perfect condition and ahead of schedule. The CDs are really great CDs and a must buy for the Pink Floyd fan.
0446577391|5.0|As other reviewers have stated, it would be a good idea to read \\"The Camel Club\\" & \\"The Collectors\\" before turning to \\"Stone Cold\\". Baldacci's latest is, in my opinion, the best so far. Hopefully, he will continue his series. Memorable characters along with great government conspiracy plots makes this a \\"must read\\". Are there really any honest officials left? Not very many according to David Baldacci. Enjoy!
B000FBGBPC|5.0|i absolutely love this album. a lot of the songs r incredibly deep && meaningful. && for those who want to make sure they actually have talent, they sound exactly the same live. it's money well spent.
B000FGGE7C|1.0|I would give this 5 stars but.... I've been double dipped in the worst way! I already own the un-cut DVD that is 7 miniutes longer. I rushed in and bought this as I enjoyed the film and wanted it in Hi-Def , without looking closely at it.<br /> Now I will have to wait for the un-cut Blu Ray! And get treble dipped! NOTE TO SONY:- WHEN YOU PUT THE UN-CUT VERSION ON BLU , THROW US A BONE AND GIVE US SOMTHING EXTRA/NEW PLEASE....

B00013F38K|5.0|This series was my first brush with Eastern philosophy. Although it is a bit dated, and not entirely politically correct (actor Don Johnson plays a Native American) the basic message is still sound and the production values are very good for its day.  I recommend getting all 3 seasons as the story does wrap up to some extent in the finally on the final disc of Season 3.
B000UOOT1W|5.0|This was bought as a Christmas gift so we have not had the opportunity to actually listen to the CD. However, I would like to comment on how fast the entire process was. I am very satisfied with the ordering process!!  Santana is the guitar god of all time....I am sure the CD will be AWESOME!!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|What an engaging sci-fi film! Strangely, I had never heard of the Firefly series - I simply stumbled across Serenity on HBO one day while channel flipping. I quickly ordered the DVD because I will watch this movie again and again. The characters are immediately engaging, and in an odd way the dialog is very good and added some texture. I was surprised that \\"western speak\\" worked so well, but kudos to Whedon and his actors for pulling it off. I loved this movie and wish Whedon would bring the crew back soon in another film.
B000KJU182|3.0|This film was on the way to being one of the best adaptations of literary fiction of all time when it threw it all away in the last 3 of 120 minutes.  Please believe everything positive people say about this film and more.  There will simply never be a better cast assembled to film this Melville novella, and the handling and treatment are visionary and extraordinary....<br /><br />...except the last 3 minutes -- so far afield of Melville's subtlety and lesson as to be incomprehensible.  Melville's story was somewhat enhanced for dramatic purposes up to this point, but all the choices were sound.  And then it was undone.<br /><br />I am witholding saying more as not to give it away, just as a warning -- especially to those who know and love Melville.  His ending could have been very simply done, and the meanings inherent here would have blossomed to cosmic proportion.  As they do in Melville's final pages.  This ends up something much more limited.  But you still have perhaps the greatest performances of all the actors involved, in any movie I have ever seen any of them in.  For the wreck of this movie does not touch what they do, nor in any way involve them (2 of the 3 major players are already offstage by then, and the 3rd does not get new lines, but is deprived of Melville's final lines for him, and proper context).<br /><br />Not wanting to be a spoiler, and never more unhappy to have to write a mixed review....
B000GFLKF8|5.0|I love a good heist flick and this one didn't disappoint. Good acting all around - especially the dynamic between the Denzel Washington and Clive Owen characters. Nice soundtrack, too. And let's not forget that a stunning appearance by a gorgeous Cartier diamond doesn't hurt. Lots of fun and a nice addition to my movie library.
B000UJ48O0|5.0|This is a not a review of the O.C.; you've probably already seen that and know what it's all about.  If not, there are other reviews that can tell you all about the content.  This is a review of \\"The O.C.: The Complete Series Collection.\\"  What a beautiful send off for those who were sad to see the show end too soon.      The packaging is really unique.  One thing that is not conveyed by the stock photos is the size--it's really big, about twice as big as I expected.  This is not going to fit easily on your average DVD shelf.  The outer case is solid and the book packaging itself is really well done.  There are some images from the original box sets' booklets as well as some new pictures that I haven't seen before.  The book contains a mix of glossy pages with the episode descriptions and Atomic County excerpts and the thicker cardboard pages holding the discs.  On these pages, there are discs on one side and a photo on the other.    The sleeves for the DVDs are cardboard, but (unlike some other sets) the discs were not scratched when I got the set.  Part of this is because a piece of foam was inserted in between the book packaging and the outer plastic case so that the book didn't slide around and bang against the case during shipping.      The new features are nice but not necessary--if you already have the sets then the decision whether to buy or to stick with season sets is mostly a matter of how much you like this packaging.  I have to say, though, the packaging is pretty dramatic and a lot of effort was put into giving this show the proper treatment.  It's not just a bunch of old discs thrown in a crappy package and called a complete set.
B000O178BY|5.0|Dear Trent: I appreciate your interest in the current state of our political system. I'm angry, too. But honestly, the current political atmosphere offers nothing for us to sink our teeth into. I wish it weren't so, but there it is. I know you can feel it. We all feel it. Whatever is happening out there, it drains us of our ideals and saps our strength. This means we must look elsewhere for sustenance. If you stick with political lyrics, even your diehard fans will fall away. I don't want you to disappear. Musically, you pack as much power as ever. Please find a way to connect with us again. Give us something to escape into.<br /><br />With that said, I can't get enough of the MUSIC on this album. Vessel contains one of the best instrumentals you've created in years. Thank you.
0805209999|5.0|I haven't read a Kafka novel before. While reading this, I always find myself internally shouting and complaining about the lack of reason within the book. I complain about Josef K's lack of ability to fight for his situation, but then again I am reminded that this is surrealism at its best. Nothing makes sense in this book. But still, I love it. As long as you are willing to understand that nothing will make sense in this book, then you will enjoy it. If you aren't willing to give up your sense of reason, then don't read this one.
B000Q6GUW0|3.0|My wife and I finished watching Six Feet Under and got this show (we have become fans Of Michael Hall).  It kind of got off to a hokey start but we are starting to get into it and appreciate it as a satire.  Michael Hall's performance makes the series worthwhile but the other characters tend to be caricatures (except for the character that Julie Benz plays).
B000JBWWRY|4.0|This is just a cinema classic that should be in every family's collection.  The bonus features aren't bad either but the real jewel is having the original movie.  It's Peter Pan ala Disney...what more is there to say.
B000SO7OMA|5.0|I'm envious of those who were able to see this concert in person.  What a beautiful setting, and how appropriate for her wonderful music.  I would love to hear new music from her so hope she is still composing.  This is a great CD and DVD!
B0002O39A2|5.0|A superb old-school prog album, with all the complexities and subtleties of good old progressive rock - the changing meters and tempos, shifting atmospheres, gorgeous organ and guitar solos and intricate interplay, several epic-length tracks. The sound has a lovely velvety texture, so often found on prog records from the early '70s, all very smooth and well-produced. The style seems like a perfect balance between Canterbury and symphonic: Canterbury on the improvizational side, symphonic on the compositional. The fact that Dave Stewart and Steve Hillage are on the album makes it all the more valuable, these two maestros being the Canterbury counterparts of Keith Emerson and Steve Howe, respectively... Absolute gem, and a must have for any prog fan.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead's album Hail to the Theif is utterly amazing.  I know my judgement may be clouded by my emmense love of this band, but seriously folks I urge you to give this album a try and another try and another try, and so on.  I don't know of any other band I could listen to day in and day out and not get bored with it.  Radiohead is that band.  Thre will be weeks where I will listen to album after album of Radiohead, one after another.  This is my all-time favorite Radiohead album.  Something just seems to speak to me from it.  It is very intriquing and mind stimulating.  It gets inside my chest and I can feel it there and it wells up inside and makes me want to drive fast and live life.  I really enjoy every song from this album but there are some definite gems that stick out.  There There is probably my favorite Radiohead song of all time.  Go to Sleep, 2+2=5, Sail to the Moon, A Wolf at the Door, these are all amazing songs as well.  Radiohead delivers a unique and diverse sound on Hail to the Theif and acheives greatness.  It is just so wonderful that they share their beautiful and awe-inspiring music with all of us.
1559408855|5.0|This has got to be one of the best movies ever made!  A perfect blend of action, comedy, and romance, \\"Salo\\" goes where most movies fear to tread, except for maybe \\"Die Hard\\" and \\"Bad Boys II\\".  There are laughs every minute coupled with just enough gun fights to make even Clint Eastwood grin and sweat.  And as far as the lovie dovey stuff, there isn't so much that it ruins the film, but I would have preferred more gratuitous nudity, like in \\"Apollo 13\\" when you see Kevin Bacon get out of the shower.  Yeah, that's the one!  I don't know why the rest of these reviews are all stuck on the artsy farsty elements of the film, I didn't get that out of \\"Salo\\" at all.<br /><br />The perfect date movie, \\"Salo\\" will guarantee a little somethin' somethin' after it's viewing.<br /><br />Two thumbs up.  Way up!
B000000WA4|5.0|Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is one of the most popular albums of the ninties, and has a definite right to that honor.  This double disc set is very diverse with countless different musical styles intertwined througout.  It goes all the way from hard-hitting heavy metal to light, enchanting love songs.  It also has its fair share of pop rock and alternative rock thrown in there.  Any fan of the Pumpkins will not be let down by the great variety of music on these two discs.       Disc one is filled with wonderful hair-raising guitar riffs on songs such as An Ode to No One, Jelly Belly, Zero, and of course the first hit from the album, Bullet with Butterfly Wings.  It also has several great ballads including Here is No Why, To Forgive, and Porcelina of the Vast Oceans.  And let us not forget one of the biggest hits from the album, Tonight, Tonight.        Disc two is also a delight but definitely has an edgier feel than disc one.  It is filled with some of the most hard-rocking songs on the album.  X.Y.U., Tales of a Scorched Earth, and Bodies are all Billy Corgan's way of telling the world to F off.  Interlaced with this angry rock are some beautiful and soul-inspiring softer pieces including Thirty-Three, By Starlight, and Stumbleine.  Disc two also includes the Pumpkin's biggest hit ever, the great techno-pop-rock song, 1979.        This is one of my favorite albums of all times.  Billy Corgan really lets you in to pick his brain and feel his emotions.  Billy and crew keep you guessing throughout the discs and come out on top with this amazing and artful collection of music.        Pretty much all the songs from this album are my favorite but if I had to pick. . .      Favorite songs:  disc 1-Here is No Why, To Forgive, Muzzle                       disc 2-Thru the Eyes of Ruby, By Starlight, Thirty-Three
B000OLGCI4|5.0|I just love the Jungle Book and this edition was great...when watching it, it brought back memories of my child-hood...I got it for my husband...It was his favorite cartoon as a child and we have been looking for it and it was not availible on DVD before, so if you are thinking about reliving your child-hood, GET IT!!
0316067598|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read.  It has a bit of everything for everyone, sarcastic humor, heroism, comradery, action, suspense, love of family and fellow team mates, honor, duty, respect, etc...I could go on and on.  People who are not familiar with the military will even enjoy this.  What a heroic story, I am so glad it was told, thank you Marcus Luttrell and thank you to your fallen comrades.
